Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. John MCLeay),10
NA,"took the chair at 10.30 a.m., and read",10
NA,prayers.,10
Dr EVATT , I wish again to ask the,10
NA,Minister acting for the Minister for,10
NA,External Affairs a question which he,10
NA,answered in part recently. This matter has,10
NA,been referred to a few times in the last four,10
NA,or five weeks. It concerns the situation,10
NA,"in Laos, which seems to have worsened.",10
NA,"The Minister for External Affairs, some",10
NA,"little time ago, advised the House, in effect,",10
NA,that the best course was for Australia to,10
NA,do nothing. I am not suggesting armed,10
NA,"intervention in Laos, but I do suggest that",10
NA,we should use the conciliation processes of,10
NA,"the United Nations, particularly the",10
NA,Security Council. If the situation in Laos,10
NA,were to worsen it could cause a very,10
NA,serious disturbance in Indo-China generally,10
NA,and perhaps further afield. Will the,10
NA,Minister look at this matter again in the,10
NA,light of developments in the last few days?,10
NA,This is an important matter and Australia,10
NA,"-indeed , any nation-ha s the right to",10
NA,bring such matters before either the,10
NA,Security Council or the General Assembly,10
NA,"of the United Nations, as the honorable",10
NA,gentleman knows.,10
Sir GARFIELD BARWICK , A few,10
NA,"days ago, in answer to a question, I told",10
NA,"the right honorable gentleman that, having",10
NA,regard to the need to respect the sovereignty,10
NA,"and independence of Laos, it was not",10
NA,thought advisable at this stage for Aus-,10
NA,"tralia to attempt, on its own initiative, to",10
NA,bring the matter before the United Nations.,10
NA,"Although I did not mention his name, I",10
NA,inferred that Mr Ngon Sananikone had,10
NA,arrived in New York and as I understood-,10
NA,I now know this to be so-wa s having,10
NA,"discussions with Mr Hammarskjold, the",10
NA,Secretary-General of the United Nations.,10
NA,There are a number of courses that may,10
NA,"be taken in relation to the United Nations,",10
NA,and I know that they are currently being,10
NA,explored by the Secretary-General and Mr.,10
NA,Sananikone. I also know that Australia's,10
NA,representative in New York is keeping: in,10
NA,"close touch with the situation and, indeed,",10
NA,is having conversations with Mr.,10
NA,Sananikone. The Government feels that,10
NA,this small but important nation of Laos,10
NA,desires to determine as far as possible its,10
NA,own course of action. We would like to,10
NA,respect that desire so long as there is no,10
NA,flare up of activities beyond the borders,10
NA,LAOS. of Laos.,10
NA,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN,10
NA,AUSTRALIA.,10
Mr BROWNE, I should like to ask a,10
NA,question of the Minister representing the,10
NA,Minister for National Development. Can,10
NA,the Minister inform the House whether,10
NA,there is in existence a government blue-,10
NA,print for the agricultural and mineral,10
NA,development of the north of Australia or,10
NA,whether the Government envisages any,10
NA,desirable line of progress in this matter? If,10
NA,"such a blueprint is in existence, or if the",10
NA,Government envisages any desirable line of,10
NA,"progress, will the Minister acknowledge the",10
NA,due importance of the matter by making,10
NA,this information public?,10
Sir GARFIELD BARWICK ,Th e Com-,10
NA,"monwealth, of course, has a great interest",10
NA,in the development of the north of Aus-,10
NA,"tralia, but, primarily, the responsibility for",10
NA,this rests on Western Australia in respect of,10
NA,the north of that State and on Queensland,10
NA,in respect of the north of Queensland.,10
NA,The Commonwealth has evidenced its,10
NA,interest in the matter by its offer of,10
NA,"Â£5,000,000 to the Western Australian Go-",10
NA,vernment not so long ago. The develop-,10
NA,ment of the Northern Territory is a matter,10
NA,"for my colleague, the Minister for Terri-",10
NA,"tories, and I shall refer the honorable mem-",10
NA,ber's question to him. I shall refer the,10
NA,matter generally also to the Minister for,10
NA,"National Development, whom I represent",10
NA,in this House.,10
NA,OVERSEAS' INVESTMENTS IN,10
NA,AUSTRALIA.,10
Mr CAIRNS , I ask the Prime Minister,10
NA,a question arising from a question asked,10
NA,fast Tuesday by the honorable member for,10
NA,"Scullin, the essential part of which was an",10
NA,inquiry whether it was this Government's,10
NA,policy to give: preference to companies with,10
NA,overseas shareholdings. The right honor-,10
NA,"able gentleman will know, from reference",10
NA,"to "" Hansard "", that he did not deal with",10
NA,that aspect of the question. I now ask,10
NA,him: Does the federal trade and import,11
NA,policy ensure preference to companies with,11
NA,overseas shareholdings?,11
Mr MENZIES ,Th e answer to that,11
NA,"question is, "" No "".",11
NA,BROADCASTING.,11
Mr HALBERT , I wish to ask the,11
NA,Postmaster-General a question. Is the,11
NA,Minister aware that a large area in the,11
NA,agricultural districts of Western Australia,11
NA,does not get reasonable radio broadcasting,11
NA,services; that there are populated areas,11
NA,within 100 miles of Perth where it is not,11
NA,worth while owning a radio set; that only,11
NA,a small proportion of the population can,11
NA,receive an alternative programme from the,11
NA,Australian Broadcasting Commission; and,11
NA,that the residents of not more than 10 per,11
NA,"cent, of my electorate can have the enjoy-",11
NA,ment of hearing the parliamentary broad-,11
NA,casts or good alternative musical pro-,11
NA,grammes? Does the Minister consider it,11
NA,only reasonable that the country districts,11
NA,of Western Australia should have proper,11
NA,broadcasting services before further money,11
NA,"is spent on television in the eastern States,",11
NA,particularly as broadcasting has been,11
NA,operating in Australia for nearly 36 years?,11
Mr DAVIDSON , I am aware that,11
NA,"there are areas in Western Australia,",11
NA,ing parts of the honorable member's elec-,11
NA,"torate, in which broadcast reception is not",11
NA,good. Similar conditions prevail in other,11
NA,parts of Australia also. The Australian,11
NA,Broadcasting Commission and particularly,11
NA,the Australian Broadcasting Control Board,11
NA,have been investigating this problem for,11
NA,"some time, and, over a considerable period,",11
NA,have been doing their best to ensure that,11
NA,broadcast reception in country areas is im-,11
NA,"proved. Last year, an engineer was sent",11
NA,to Western Australia to make a thorough,11
NA,survey of broadcast reception in that State.,11
NA,He returned and made a comprehensive,11
NA,"report, which is still under study by the",11
NA,Broadcasting Control Board for the pur-,11
NA,pose of determining what further action,11
NA,can be taken to improve reception in the,11
NA,area.,11
NA,In reply to one of the points made by,11
NA,"the honorable member, I point out that",11
NA,improvements are not being delayed by the,11
NA,expenditure of money on the extension of,11
NA,television services. The funds available to,11
NA,"the Post Office, the Broadcasting Control",11
NA,Board and the Australian Broadcasting,11
NA,Commission for the extension and improve-,11
NA,ment of radio broadcast services have not,11
NA,been varied as a result of the development,11
NA,of television.,11
NA,"As I have already pointed out, reception",11
NA,in other parts of Australia also needs atten-,11
NA,"tion from time to time, and we have",11
NA,"adopted, as our main policy, one of",11
NA,increasing the power of stations which can,11
NA,provide alternative programmes in country,11
NA,areas. An example of what has already,11
NA,been done in this regard is available at,11
NA,"Wagin in Western Australia, where the",11
NA,power of the station was built up about,11
NA,"twelve months ago to 50,000 watts.",11
NA,Similar action has been taken at station,11
NA,"4QN, Townsville, and at the station at",11
NA,Grafton in New South Wales. These sta-,11
NA,tions are serving large country areas which,11
NA,previously had not enjoyed very good,11
NA,reception. As a result of the building up,11
NA,"of their power to 50,000 watts, they are",11
NA,providing a vastly improved service for,11
NA,those areas. This policy will be extended,11
NA,further in Western Australia. I repeat,11
NA,that the power has already been built up at,11
NA,"Wagin, and it is intended as a part of our",11
NA,"forthcoming programme, but at a date that",11
NA,"I cannot specify at present, to increase the",11
NA,"includpower of station 6WF to 50,000 watts.",11
NA,EDUCATION.,11
Mr WHTTLAM , I address a question,11
NA,to the Prime Minister. Last March the,11
NA,right honorable gentleman promised the,11
NA,Premiers that he would set out quite fully,11
NA,and categorically in a letter to each of them,11
NA,his reasons for refusing to set up a joint,11
NA,Commonwealth-State commission into,11
NA,"primary, secondary and technical educa-",11
NA,tion. I believe that last month he sent,11
NA,"letters to them. Meantime, on 21st April,",11
NA,the Leader of the House told the honor-,11
NA,able member for Newcastle that he would,11
NA,inquire whether copies of the letters could,11
NA,be distributed among honorable members.,11
NA,1 now ask the Prime Minister whether,11
NA,he will table the letters or otherwise make,11
NA,"their text available, and in particular",11
NA,whether he will do so before the debate on,11
NA,the Estimates for his department.,11
Mr MENZIES ,Th e answer to the,11
NA,"question is: "" Yes, I will "".",11
NA,TRADE WITH RUSSIA.,12
Mr LUCOCK ,Ca n the Minister for,12
NA,"Trade advise the House whether, in view",12
NA,of the re-establishment of diplomatic mis-,12
NA,sions between Austraha and the Soviet,12
NA,"Union, there is any likelihood of increased",12
NA,sales of Australian products to that country?,12
NA,"Further, can the Minister comment on",12
NA,newspaper speculations that Russian wool-,12
NA,buyers will participate direcdy in the,12
NA,present series of wool auctions?,12
Mr MCEWEN , I am not in a position,12
NA,to answer the question with any precision.,12
NA,Let me make it clear that in whatever dis-,12
NA,cussions took place prior to the re-,12
NA,establishment of diplomatic missions,12
NA,"between Australia and the Soviet Union,",12
NA,"there was no mention, except perhaps by",12
NA,"way of passing reference, to trade. There",12
NA,was certainly none of sufficient significance,12
NA,to bring me into the discussions. The,12
NA,"matter of trade, therefore, was not basic to",12
NA,the re-establishment of diplomatic missions.,12
NA,"However, the Russians themselves have",12
NA,announced that they are going to re-enter,12
NA,the wool auction room. We have reason,12
NA,to believe that they wish to procure our,12
NA,"wool, and it might be reasonable to expect",12
NA,their re-entry into the auction room. I,12
NA,understand also that the Soviet Union will,12
NA,station in Canberra a commercial coun-,12
NA,"sellor. If and when that occurs, I have",12
NA,no doubt that we shall achieve a better,12
NA,understanding of the desired commercial,12
NA,relationship between Australia and the,12
NA,Soviet Union. As regards Australia's atti-,12
NA,"tude, we have never placed any obstruction",12
NA,in the way of the sale to the Soviet of our,12
NA,"ordinary, normal export products, such as",12
NA,foodstuffs and wool.,12
NA,COMMONWEALTH PROFESSIONAL,12
NA,OFFICERS.,12
Mr BRYANT ,I s the Prime Minister,12
NA,aware that the Commissioner for the,12
NA,Snowy Mountains Authority stated recently,12
NA,that difficulty was experienced in obtaining,12
NA,adequate numbers of trained technical,12
NA,people for government projects? Is this,12
NA,the case with other government instrumen-,12
NA,"talities and departments, and is it due to",12
NA,the fact that higher salaries are paid by,12
NA,private concerns? Does he approve of a,12
NA,statement by the Minister for National,12
NA,Development that it is desirable that,12
NA,private companies should attract govern-,12
NA,ment-trained personnel from the Bureau of,12
NA,Mineral Resources? Will the right honor-,12
NA,able gentleman examine the matter of the,12
NA,salaries of the qualified professional men,12
NA,"engaged in such work, in order to place",12
NA,government departments in a better com-,12
NA,petitive position?,12
Mr MENZIES , 1 did not hear either,12
NA,of the statements that have been referred,12
NA,to by the honorable member. I would be,12
NA,very pleased to find out what was said.,12
NA,PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS.,12
Mr KILLEN ,M y question is,12
NA,addressed to the Minister for Health. Are,12
NA,there many drugs available only on a,12
NA,"doctor's prescription, the dispensing of",12
NA,which would attract charges of less than,12
NA,5s.? Will the Minister describe the posi-,12
NA,tion of drugs on those prescriptions in,12
NA,relation to the Government's current,12
NA,proposals?,12
Dr DONALD CAMERON , I give this,12
NA,"as my own impression, because I cannot",12
NA,answer with complete precision: I should,12
NA,"think that, of the total number of doctors'",12
NA,"prescriptions presented by patients, only a",12
NA,relatively small number could be dispensed,12
NA,by chemists for less than 5s. That does not,12
NA,cover merely single drugs; it covers com-,12
NA,pounded medicines as well. The honorable,12
NA,gentleman also asks about the effect of the,12
NA,Government's proposals on prescribing.,12
NA,What is proposed is that the range of drugs,12
NA,at present regarded as pharmaceutical,12
NA,benefits will be greatly increased and will,12
NA,"not, in fact, be limited to single drugs, so",12
NA,that a great many prescriptions for which,12
NA,the patient now pays will be brought,12
NA,within the range of pharmaceutical benefits.,12
NA,NATURALIZATION.,12
Mr LUCHETTI , I ask the Minister for,12
NA,Territories whether he has given further,12
NA,consideration to granting Australian citizen-,12
NA,ship to people of European-Melanesian,12
NA,mixed blood in the Territory of Papua and,12
NA,"New Guinea. If he has done so, what",12
NA,action does he intend to take? Will the,12
NA,Minister tell the House what percentage,12
NA,"of people of Asian origin, including",12
NA,"Chinese, have accepted the opportunity to",12
NA,take out Australian citizenship in the,12
NA,Territory?,12
Mr HASLUCK ,A s a result of the,13
NA,"decision of this Government, an oppor-",13
NA,tunity was given to certain persons of,13
NA,Asian origin who were born in the Terri-,13
NA,tory or who had lived there for a long time,13
NA,to become Australian citizens. Although I,13
NA,"cannot give the exact percentage, I would",13
NA,be correct in saying that the big majority,13
NA,of those eligible under the Government's,13
NA,decision have become or are in process of,13
NA,becoming naturalized Australian citizens.,13
NA,This has left us with the problem of a,13
NA,small number of Asians who were not,13
NA,eligible under the previous decision and a,13
NA,comparatively small number of persons of,13
NA,mixed blood who have an indefinite status.,13
NA,Considerable work has been done both in,13
NA,the Territory and in the Department of,13
NA,Territories in Canberra in examining the,13
NA,problem and in preparing proposals. I am,13
NA,sure that the honorable member will,13
NA,realize that this is a matter for decision,13
NA,"by Cabinet, and I shall shortly make",13
NA,mendations to Cabinet on the matter.,13
NA,PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS.,13
Mr BUCHANAN ,M y question is,13
NA,directed to the Minister for Health. Will,13
NA,the increased range of drugs available as,13
NA,pharmaceutical benefits allow the prescripcated,13
NA,tion of cortisone for the treatment of,13
NA,arthritic conditions?,13
Dr DONALD CAMERON ,Cortison e,13
NA,"is, in fact, available for the treatment",13
NA,"arthritic conditions at present, subject to",13
NA,"certain restrictions. That is to say,",13
NA,one of a class of what are known as second,13
NA,schedule or restricted drugs. Although,13
NA,"those drugs are pharmaceutical benefits,",13
NA,their use as pharmaceutical benefits is,13
NA,restricted to a certain range of diseases.,13
NA,The proposals announced by the Treasurer,13
NA,in his Budget speech will not affect that,13
NA,position one way or the other. There will,13
NA,still be two schedules- a general schedule,13
NA,of drugs which may be prescribed as phar-,13
NA,"maceutical benefits for any disease, and a",13
NA,restricted schedule of drugs which may be,13
NA,prescribed as pharmaceutical benefits only,13
NA,for a limited range of diseases.,13
NA,POSTAL DEPARTMENT.,13
Mr COSTA ,Las t week I asked the,13
NA,Postmaster-General whether it was true,13
NA,that the Postal Department was placing the,13
NA,collection of outstanding telephone debts,13
NA,in the hands of outside debt collecting,13
NA,"agencies for a 10 per cent, payment of",13
NA,the amount collected. Has he yet obtained,13
NA,"this information? If so, will he let me",13
NA,have it?,13
Mr DAVIDSON , I am sorry that I,13
NA,have not yet obtained the information for,13
NA,which the honorable member asked last,13
NA,"week. I did start inquiries, and I expect to",13
NA,receive the information very shortly. As,13
NA,soon as I do I will give it to the honorable,13
NA,member.,13
NA,COMMONWEALTH DEVELOPMENT,13
NA,BANK.,13
Mr BRIMBLECOMBE , I ask the,13
NA,Treasurer: Is the Commonwealth Develop-,13
NA,ment Bank now established and ready for,13
NA,"business? If not, as there are many young",13
NA,men in this country who are eager to go,13
NA,recomon the land and who desire to use this,13
NA,"bank's services, can the Minister say when",13
NA,this organization will be ready for wide-,13
NA,spread operation?,13
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,Th e Common-,13
NA,wealth Development Bank has not yet been,13
NA,officially constituted for the purposes indi-,13
NA,by the honorable member. I think,13
NA,that earlier in the year I mentioned that it,13
NA,was probable that it would come into full,13
NA,operation at the beginning of the next,13
NA,calendar year. Arrangements have been,13
NA,of in train for the appointment of the,13
NA,various elements of the Commonwealth,13
NA,it is Banking Corporation and announcements,13
NA,should have been made this morning-the y,13
NA,were authorized by me-o f the appoint-,13
NA,ments of the general managers of the three,13
NA,banks making up the corporation. But,13
NA,until such time as the Commonwealth,13
NA,"Development Bank functions as such, there",13
NA,"remain, of course, the industrial finance",13
NA,section of the Commonwealth Bank and,13
NA,"the mortgage bank section, either of which",13
NA,"would be capable, perhaps, of dealing with",13
NA,the kind of problem which the honorable,13
NA,"member has in mind, at least until the",13
NA,other bank comes into full operation.,13
NA,TAXATION IN PAPUA AND NEW,13
NA,GUINEA.,13
Mr DUTHIE , I ask the Minister for,13
NA,Territories whether one reason for the bit-,13
NA,"ter opposition to taxation in New Guinea,",13
NA,"especially from the planters, is that they",14
NA,regard payment of tax as a lowering of,14
NA,their status in the eyes of the native people,14
NA,"who, themselves, pay tax. What level of",14
NA,taxation has been imposed in relation to,14
NA,taxation in Australia?,14
Mr HASLUCK , I would not attempt,14
NA,to analyse the motives of any one who may,14
NA,be opposing the introduction of taxation.,14
NA,I imagine that the motives vary from place,14
NA,to place. I think the honorable member,14
NA,is perhaps in error in saying that the,14
NA,"planters, as a class, are against taxation.",14
NA,Some planters are opposing it as indivi-,14
NA,"duals, but we know that there are quite a",14
NA,number of people engaged in planting who,14
NA,are not opposing it and who recognize that,14
NA,"the abolition of export duties, which were",14
NA,part of the whole reform carried out allied,14
NA,"with the introduction of income tax, will",14
NA,be more to their advantage and a greater,14
NA,encouragement to development than the,14
NA,old system.,14
NA,"Regarding the level of taxation, the rate",14
NA,of taxation both on private individuals,14
NA,and on companies is approximately half,14
NA,the rate imposed on equivalent incomes in,14
NA,"Australia, but in consequence of the fact",14
NA,that the concessional deductions in the,14
NA,Territory are much more liberal than on,14
NA,the Australian mainland and in view of,14
NA,the fact that some concessions are given,14
NA,"which are not allowed in Australia at all,",14
NA,the actual payment of tax by a person on,14
NA,an income will be considerably less than,14
NA,half of what would be paid by an Aus-,14
NA,tralian on an equivalent income.,14
NA,"R.A.A.F. CAMP, URANQUINTY.",14
Mr FAIRBAIRN , I ask the Minister,14
NA,for the Interior whether the installations at,14
NA,the Royal Australian Air Force camp at,14
NA,Uranquinty have been handed over to his,14
NA,"department for disposal. I f so, can",14
NA,inform the House whether the camp will,14
NA,be offered for sale as a whole to some,14
NA,"organization, or whether the various",14
NA,stallations will be sold separately for,14
NA,dismantling and re-erection elsewhere?,14
NA,Will the unused land be offered first to,14
NA,relatives of those people from whom it,14
NA,was compulsorily resumed during the war?,14
Mr FREETH ,Th e honorable member,14
NA,has taken a great interest in the Uranquinty,14
NA,station ever since it became known that it,14
NA,was no longer required by the Royal,14
NA,"Australian Air Force. However, the sta-",14
NA,tion was handed to my department for,14
NA,disposal only a week or ten days ago. We,14
NA,have received numerous inquiries from,14
NA,people wishing to purchase some of the,14
NA,"land or some of the buildings on the land,",14
NA,and we do not expect any difficulty in,14
NA,disposing of the installations separately.,14
NA,"However, I know that the honorable mem-",14
NA,"ber is interested in maintaining, as far as",14
NA,"possible, the value of the aerodrome as an",14
NA,"intact unit, and the department at present",14
NA,is negotiating with the New South Wales,14
NA,"Government, which is interested in acquir-",14
NA,ing approximately 400 acres of the land,14
NA,for its own purposes. I am unable to,14
NA,state the stage that has been reached in the,14
NA,"negotiations, but I shall keep the honorable",14
NA,member informed of the position.,14
NA,DENTAL SERVICES.,14
Mr STEWART ,"Yesterday , I directed",14
NA,a question to the Minister for Health con-,14
NA,cerning negotiations between the Australian,14
NA,Dental Association and the Department of,14
NA,Health for the establishment of a dental,14
NA,"health scheme. If, as stated yesterday, no",14
NA,"such negotiations are taking place, will the",14
NA,Minister now inform the House what,14
NA,action has been or is being taken to raise,14
NA,"the standard of dental health in Australia,",14
NA,and to make dental treatment less costly?,14
Dr DONALD CAMERON ,Standard s,14
NA,of professional practice in Australia are not,14
NA,matters for determination by the Common-,14
NA,wealth Department of Health.,14
NA,POSTAL DEPARTMENT.,14
Mr SWARTZ ,Ca n the Postmaster-,14
NA,General say when it is expected that the,14
NA,he extensive work on the Toowoomba auto-,14
NA,matic telephone exchange system will be,14
NA,completed? Is the system that is being,14
NA,"ininstalled at the main automatic exchange,",14
NA,"and the two supplementary exchanges, of",14
NA,a type that incorporates new developments,14
NA,"the known as the cross-bar system? If so, will",14
NA,this project be used as a pilot system with,14
NA,a view to the provision of this kind of,14
NA,exchange in other centres of Australia?,14
NA,Has the Minister a firm estimate of the,14
NA,total cost of the project in Toowoomba?,14
Mr DAVIDSON ,Th e exchange equip-,15
NA,ment that is being installed in the post,15
NA,office at Toowoomba is known as the,15
NA,cross-bar system. Although this is not a,15
NA,"new system, it has been considerably",15
NA,"developed in recent years. Previously, we",15
NA,have used what is known as the step-by-,15
NA,step system. We believe that the develop-,15
NA,ment of the cross-bar system will offer,15
NA,considerable opportunities to reduce the,15
NA,"space required for installation, that it will",15
NA,reduce maintenance and that it will permit,15
NA,of more effective operation. Our engineers,15
NA,who have been investigating the develop-,15
NA,ment of this system in both France and,15
NA,Sweden have obtained information which,15
NA,has led them to believe that the advantages,15
NA,that I have mentioned will be obtained.,15
NA,"We have decided, therefore, to pursue the",15
NA,possibility of introducing steadily this kind,15
NA,of equipment throughout Australia.,15
NA,Already the two small installations that,15
NA,have been made in Melbourne have proved,15
NA,"successful and, in the circumstances, we",15
NA,have decided to install the system in,15
NA,"Toowoomba, a rural city which, as honor-",15
NA,"able members will realize, is eminently",15
NA,"suited, by reason of its wide coverage, for",15
NA,this kind* of installation. The results,15
NA,obtained in Toowoomba will be a guide,15
NA,to the department as to the desirability of,15
NA,proceeding with further installations. To,15
NA,install this equipment will cost in the,15
NA,"vicinity of Â£383,000, and I believe that it",15
NA,will come into operation about the middle,15
NA,of next year. The department is not only,15
NA,pursuing the possibility of introducing this,15
NA,"improved system, but is also investigating",15
NA,the possibility of the equipment being,15
NA,manufactured in Australia if it is successful.,15
NA,POSTAL CHARGES.,15
Mr WARD ,I s it a fact that the,15
NA,"Treasurer, in endeavouring to justify the",15
NA,proposed increases in charges imposed by,15
NA,"the Postmaster-General's Department, ex-",15
NA,pressed the view that in assessing the,15
NA,"financial position of the department, allow-",15
NA,ance should be made for an interest charge,15
NA,on invested capital? Is it a fact that capital,15
NA,expenditure which he stated had been pro-,15
NA,vided from revenue since the termination,15
NA,"of World War II . , was met from taxa-",15
NA,"tion imposed on the general public? If so,",15
NA,does the Treasurer agree that to increase,15
NA,charges now to meet the payment of,15
NA,"interest upon invested capital is, in fact,",15
NA,compelling the taxpayer to pay interest,15
NA,to the Government upon capital which he,15
NA,himself has supplied to the Government,15
NA,free of cost?,15
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,Thes e matters,15
NA,can be looked at in rather different ways.,15
NA,It is a fact that the very substantial,15
NA,amounts of capital invested in the Post,15
NA,Office since World War II . have been,15
NA,"obtained, not from loans, but from revenue.",15
NA,"In that sense, the taxpayer has contributed,",15
NA,"in the form of revenue, to works which",15
NA,normally a government would prefer to,15
NA,finance by way of loan if that were prac-,15
NA,ticable. 1 think that all members know,15
NA,the reasons why it has not been practicable,15
NA,for us to provide loan moneys for this pur-,15
NA,pose. All the loan raisings of the Com-,15
NA,"monwealth Government, over these years,",15
NA,have been devoted to the needs of the,15
NA,State Governments. If we were not to have,15
NA,a component in postal charges representing,15
NA,"some return on capital invested, then the",15
NA,taxpayer who has already contributed to,15
NA,the capital cost of the Post Office in this,15
NA,"substantial degree, would have to contribute",15
NA,further amounts in the years ahead. That,15
NA,is obvious enough to any one who bothers,15
NA,to think about it.,15
NA,"Roughly Â£50,000,000 has to be found",15
NA,this year from the Budget for the capital,15
NA,needs of the Post Office. The correspond-,15
NA,ing sum in subsequent budgets is likely to,15
NA,"grow appreciably larger in the years ahead,",15
NA,as Australia grows. If those who use the,15
NA,"services of the Postal Department do not,",15
NA,"in the aggregate, provide a commercial",15
NA,"return to the department, quite clearly the",15
NA,taxpayer of the future instead of those who,15
NA,"use the services, will have to go on pro-",15
NA,viding money for the needs of the Post,15
NA,"Office. So while, in a sense, it is true",15
NA,that the taxpayer has provided these capital,15
NA,moneys and that the increased charges will,15
NA,affect some taxpayers-no t all of them to,15
NA,"the same degree-i n future, a more just",15
NA,distribution of Postal Department expenses,15
NA,"and charges will be made, bearing on those",15
NA,who use the services rather than on the,15
NA,general body of taxpayers.,15
NA,WHEAT RESEARCH.,15
Mr KING ,I n view of a report in,15
NA,Victoria that wheat research now remains,15
NA,"deadlocked, can the Minister for Primary",16
NA,Industry give consideration to a request,16
NA,that i made in this House for the matter,16
NA,be put to the growers in the form of a to implement it.,16
NA,ballot to try to finalize this very important,16
NA,issue?,16
Mr ADERMANN , I do not think that,16
NA,this matter requires any action on my part,16
NA,at the present moment. I understand,16
NA,officials of the Australian Wheatgrowers',16
NA,Federation are discussing the problem with Gladys?,16
NA,the Victorian Government. I hope that,16
NA,they can come to some arrangement to,16
NA,correct this impasse.,16
NA,RATES OF EXCHANGE.,16
Mr CLAY , I direct a question to the,16
NA,Treasurer. Has the right honorable gentlethat,16
NA,"man heard of Dr Ludwig Erhardt, financial",16
NA,adviser to the German Government? Has,16
NA,the Treasurer given any consideration,16
NA,two or more different rates of exchange?,16
NA,A base rate such as 25s. to the Â£1 sterling,16
NA,for essential imports and another rate,16
NA,"say, 35s. to the Â£1 sterling for luxury",16
NA,imports such as Swiss chocolates might,16
NA,"cited as an example,",16
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,Th e question,16
NA,of a rather more technical character than,16
NA,would permit of a ready answer without,16
NA,"notice. I ask the honorable gentleman,",16
NA,"therefore, to put his question on the notice-",16
NA,"paper. But by way of general reply,",16
NA,could not see such a system meeting more,16
NA,conveniently and effectively the import,16
NA,problems of this country than the arrange-,16
NA,ments already in train under the direction,16
NA,"of my colleague, the Minister for Trade.",16
NA,POSTAL RATES.,16
Mr CASH ,Wil l the Postmasterlike,16
NA,"General, bearing in mind the law of question.",16
NA,"diminishing returns, give consideration",16
NA,introducing each year a special postal,16
NA,"for Christmas cards? Over 120,000,000",16
NA,Christmas cards are posted in Australia,16
NA,each Christmas conveying messages that,16
NA,contribute greatly to peace on earth and,16
NA,goodwill among all men.,16
Mr DAVIDSON ,Th e honorable mem-,16
NA,ber's suggestion is very interesting. He,16
NA,asked me whether I will give consideration,16
NA,"to it. My reply is: Yes, of course. Seeing",16
NA,that he has put it to me I shall certainly,16
NA,"give it consideration, but I cannot hold out",16
NA,to to him any great hope that I will be able,16

NA,ABORIGINES.,16
Mr COPE ,Wil l the Minister for Terri-,16
NA,that tories inform the House of the latest,16
NA,"development between Daly, Arthur and",16
Mr HASLUCK ," Mr Speaker, in",16
NA,answer to a telegram that was sent to me,16
NA,"by the suitor, Mr Daly, I informed him",16
NA,that there should be no reasonable objec-,16
NA,tion to his interviewing Gladys and con-,16
NA,tinuing to talk with her. But I suggested,16
NA,he should discuss with the Administra-,16
NA,tor of the Northern Territory an arrange-,16
NA,ment under which the question might be,16
NA,"deferred for, say, six months so as to make",16
NA,to sure that the woman herself was clear,16
NA,"about her own wishes, because she had",16
NA,made avowals of preference for Arthur,16
NA,"of, and avowals of preference for Daly. I",16
NA,also suggested that a period of six months,16
NA,be would allow us time to sort out the exact,16
NA,significance of the tribal relationship,16
NA,is between the woman and Arthur. Con-,16
NA,"sequent on that suggestion-and , of course,",16
NA,six months is very much less than the seven,16
NA,years that Jacob was prepared to serve,16
NA,for Leah and another seven years for,16
NA,I Rachel-counse l for Daly wrote to the,16
NA,"Administrator, in terms which generally",16
NA,"were rather demanding, and sought an",16
NA,immediate solution. The Administrator,16
NA,has again invited counsel for Daly and,16
NA,Daly himself to discuss with him this,16
NA,arrangement for what might be termed a,16
NA,cooling-off period.,16
Mr CLYDE CAMERON , I should,16
NA,to ask the Minister for Territories a,16
NA,Is it a fact that the person who,16
NA,to is making the inquiries into this affair,16
NA,"rate between Arthur and Gladys, which was",16
NA,"mentioned in the House last week, is a",16
NA,man by the name of Ward? Is it also a,16
NA,fact that people bearing this name are,16
NA,notorious for their inquisitiveness about,16
NA,other people's affairs?,16
Mr HASLUCK ,I t is true that Mr.,16
NA,"has Daly's counsel, who represented him in the",16
NA,court proceedings and is acting for him,16
NA,"at present, is a Mr Ward. Mr Ward also",16
NA,has the added function of being a member,17
NA,of the Legislative Council for the Northern,17
NA,"Territory. So, in both his capacity as a",17
NA,local member and as counsel for one of,17
NA,"the parties concerned, he has been very",17
NA,active in the matter. I have no knowledge,17
NA,at all of the characteristics of the Ward,17

NA,SMALLPOX.,17
Mr CLEAVER ,Ha s the Minister for,17
NA,Health received a resolution from the,17
NA,annual conference of the Parents and,17
NA,Citizens Federation of Western Australia,17
NA,asking for a national immunization plan,17
NA,against smallpox? Does the Minister con-,17
NA,"sider that, due to the shorter travelling",17
NA,"between Asia and Australia, there is any",17
NA,danger of smallpox becoming epidemic?,17
NA,"If so, will he earnestly consider the im-",17
NA,munization proposal to which I have,17
NA,referred?,17
Dr DONALD CAMERON ,"No , Mr.",17
NA,"Speaker, I have not received such a",17
NA,request. The question of immunization,17
NA,against smallpox is constantly in the mind,17
NA,of the Department of Health. I do not,17
NA,think it is necessary to institute a national,17
NA,"campaign, but I think it is a good thing",17
NA,that people should be aware that although,17
NA,we have excellent quarantine arrangements,17
NA,"which, so far, have been highly successful",17
NA,in preventing smallpox from either gain-,17
NA,"ing access to, or spreading in, this country,",17
NA,it is always a possibility that even with,17
NA,the best arrangements smallpox will enter,17
NA,"the country, so I think it is probably highly",17
NA,desirable that people should voluntarily,17
NA,undergo vaccination.,17
NA,POSTAL DEPARTMENT.,17
Mr DRUMMOND , I desire to ask the,17
NA,Postmaster-General a question without,17
NA,"notice, which I would preface, Sir, by",17
NA,referring very briefly to an answer given,17
NA,by the Treasurer to a question concerning,17
NA,"the Commonwealth Bank. Apparently,",17
NA,"the Government, in its wisdom, has decided",17
NA,to give semi-autonomy to certain branches,17
NA,"of the bank under a general policy, in",17
NA,order to enable the bank to expand more,17
NA,healthfully on the lines of big business,17
NA,wherever it develops. Having regard to,17
NA,"those facts, I ask the Postmaster-General",17
NA,"whether he, or the Government, has con-",17
NA,sidered a similar proposal to apply to what,17
NA,"is now a very big enterprise which must,",17
NA,"with the growth of our population, become",17
NA,"much bigger-tha t is, the Postal Depart-",17
NA,ment and all its associated activities. Has,17
NA,consideration been given to proposals for,17
NA,creating semi-autonomous branches under,17
NA,a central general policy control?,17
Mr DAVIDSON ,"No , I do not know",17
NA,of any such proposal having been con-,17
NA,sidered. Certainly it has not come before,17
NA,me and I have not heard that the Govern-,17
NA,ment has considered the proposal of the,17
NA,honorable member for New England that,17
NA,"we establish, if I understand him correctly,",17
NA,a series of semi-autonomous branches of,17
NA,time the Postal Department which would operate,17
NA,"more or less autonomously, with some",17
NA,"general direction, in country areas.",17
NA,"Mr Drummond -No , no-throughou t",17
NA,the Commonwealth.,17
Mr DAVIDSON ,"Well , throughout the",17
NA,"Commonwealth. Therefore, the reply is",17
NA,that no consideration has yet been given,17
NA,"to such a proposal, but I shall be happy",17
NA,to make some inquiries as to its feasibility.,17
NA,TRADE WITH CHINA.,17
Mr JONES ,M y question without,17
NA,notice is to the Minister for Trade. In,17
NA,asking it I make reference to a question,17
NA,that I asked the right honorable gentleman,17
NA,"yesterday, relative to the export of wool,",17
NA,steel and other materials to mainland,17
NA,China. In reply he indicated to me that,17
NA,goods for export to mainland China were in,17
NA,three categories. The first category consisted,17
NA,of goods the export of which was absolutely,17
NA,"forbidden, and that category has never been",17
NA,modified. The second category consisted of,17
NA,goods on an intermediate list. Those goods,17
NA,could be exported subject to the approval,17
NA,of the Department of External Affairs. The,17
NA,"third category comprised foodstuffs, wool",17
NA,and other goods on which there has never,17
NA,been an export ban.,17
NA,I ask the Minister whether I and other,17
NA,honorable members may have a copy of,17
NA,"those lists. Further, how long has steel",17
NA,been considered a non-defence material?,17
NA,In the light of his reply to my question,17
NA,"yesterday, does the Minister not consider",17
NA,the Government's declared policy of non-,17
NA,recognition of mainland China to be sheer,17
NA,humbug?,17
NA,Mir. MCEWEN -List s are not available.,18
NA,I think that yesterday I did say that the ex-,18
NA,port of goods in one category was abso-,18
NA,lutely forbidden. I think I also added that,18
NA,that category had never been modified. In,18
NA,using those terms I was perhaps not com-,18
NA,"pletely correct, for which I express regret,",18
NA,because I think there is some scope for,18
NA,modification between the forbidden list and,18
NA,the list of goods that are available for,18
NA,export subject to permission from the,18
NA,Department of External Affairs. I think,18
NA,it is obvious that if the export of certain,18
NA,goods is to be forbidden due to strategic,18
NA,"considerations, the current appraisal of",18
NA,strategic circumstances could lead to some,18
NA,"modification in that list. In fact, my state-",18
NA,ment that certain goods may be exported,18
NA,subject to approval by the Department of,18
NA,"External Affairs, indicates some fluidity of",18
NA,judgment from time to time in relation to,18
NA,that category. The conclusion to be drawn,18
NA,is that there is no hard and fast rule that,18
NA,certain goods shall be placed in a particular,18
NA,category.,18
NA,BUDGET 1959-60.,18
NA,In Committee of Supply: Consideration,18
NA,"resumed from 26th August (vide page 612),",18
NA,on motion by Mr Harold Holt-,18
NA,That the first item in the Estimates under,18
NA,"Division No. 101-Th e Senate-namely , "" Salaries",18
NA,"and allowances, Â£29,600"", be agreed to.",18

NA,"Chairman, the Budget presented by the",18
NA,Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt)-hi s first,18
NA,that capacity-ca n only be described,18
NA,disappointing. I believe that opinion,18
NA,widely shared throughout the community. occasion.,18
NA,In what is normally a profoundly important,18
NA,"financial document, the Government's",18
NA,placency in the face of its failure to,18
NA,with the real problems affecting Australia concerned?,18
NA,can only be described as alarming. For,18
NA,"example, the Treasurer dismissed the",18
NA,ployment situation with a brief reference,18
NA,the fact that employment rose on the one,18
NA,hand and unemployment fell on the other.,18
NA,That statement is only partially correct,18
NA,will not stand up to careful analysis. The,18
NA,Budget completely ignores the alarming,18
NA,situation into which farm income has been,18
NA,allowed to decline. Although farm income,18
NA,"during 1958-59 rose to Â£399,000,000, which",18
NA,was a slight improvement on the previous,18
NA,"year, it was substantially less than the",18
NA,"amount of Â£514,000,000 earned during",18
NA,1956-57. The purchasing power of far-,18
NA,mers' incomes therefore is considerably less,18
NA,than it was two years ago. But still there,18
NA,is no indication from this Government that,18
NA,it intends to do anything about checking,18
NA,"that drift except, of course, to abdicate",18
NA,from the field of land settlement and leave,18
NA,the States to their own devices in that,18
NA,respect. The Budget refuses anything but,18
NA,a mere token handout to the pensioners,18
NA,and it completely ignores the problems of,18
NA,"large families, many of which are desper-",18
NA,ately in need of help and a substantia],18
NA,number of which are to-day expected to,18
NA,exist on a benefit commonly known as the,18
NA,dole.,18
NA,The Budget ignores the opportunity that,18
NA,now exists to end the housing crisis and at,18
NA,the same time enable a large percentage of,18
NA,those people who are to-day without useful,18
NA,employment to return to work. On the,18
NA,"contrary, the Treasurer merely made a",18
NA,general reference to the worth of the indi-,18
NA,vidual citizen and his value to the Aus-,18
NA,tralian community generally. He then,18
NA,proceeded to ignore all of the matters to,18
NA,which I have referred and with which the,18
NA,individual citizen is so vitally concerned.,18
NA,"That, I believe, is the general context",18
NA,of the Budget that was presented only a,18
NA,few days ago by the Treasurer. I concede,18
NA,. that Australians generally are a very,18
NA,"patient, industrious and co-operative race",18
NA,in of people but it would be understandable,18
NA,as if they were somewhat concerned at the,18
NA,is Budget that has been presented on this,18
NA,May I refer to some of the things,18
NA,comwith which the great majority of,18
NA,deal people in this country are vitally,18
NA,They are affected by,18
NA,"housing, education and health facilities.",18
NA,emWhilst it may be said that opportunities,18
NA,"to exist in this country for decent housing,",18
NA,that health facilities are available and that,18
NA,there are employment opportunities for,18
NA,and those people in the community who are,18
NA,"fortunately placed, it must be admitted at",18
NA,the same time that for the great majority,18
NA,"of people, education and health facilities.",18
NA,which are increasingly becoming the,19
NA,responsibility of the Commonwealth Go-,19
NA,"vernment, are no longer available to the",19
NA,extent that they should be.,19
NA,Let me refer again to the problem of,19
NA,unemployment. I remember that we com-,19
NA,menced the year 1958 with a most signi-,19
NA,ficant statement from the then Minister for,19
NA,"Labour and National Service, who is now",19
NA,our Treasurer. In a news release at that,19
NA,time issued by the Department of Labour,19
NA,and National Service he said that the year,19
NA,was a most significant one so far as employ-,19
NA,ment was concerned. But what was the,19
NA,real position then? According to the,19
NA,figures that had been released by the,19
NA,"Minister himself, the number of persons",19
NA,registered with the various offices of the,19
NA,Department of Labour and National,19
NA,Service throughout Australia had increased,19
NA,"by almost 6,000 compared with the number",19
NA,in the previous year. The number of per-,19
NA,sons in receipt of unemployment benefits,19
NA,"had risen by almost 1,600. Yet the",19
NA,"responsible Minister, the Government",19
NA,"spokesman in these matters, suggested that",19
NA,1958 saw an improvement in the,19
NA,employment position!,19
NA,Let me put the position in another way.,19
NA,"At the end of January, 1955, the number",19
NA,of persons registered for employment with,19
NA,the various offices of the Department of,19
NA,"Labour and National Service was 16,266.",19
NA,"By 1956-tha t is, the year of the Govern-",19
NA,"ment's little Budget, which secured from",19
NA,the people of this country additional,19
NA,"revenue of Â£115,000,000-th e number of",19
NA,persons registered for employment had,19
NA,"risen to 31,000. In 1957, the figure was",19
NA,"never less than 46,000. During 1958, the",19
NA,number of persons registered for work,19
NA,"rose first to 56,000 and, at the end of the",19
NA,"year, stood at 64,000. The latest figures",19
NA,given in a news release made only a few,19
NA,days ago by the present Minister for,19
NA,Labour and National Service ( Mr.,19
NA,MCMahon) indicate that the number regis-,19
NA,"tered now stands at 63,623. I suggest",19
NA,"that, in the circumstances, there is no",19
NA,cause for complacency about unemploy-,19
NA,ment on the part of this Government,19
NA,"because, in only two years, the number of",19
NA,persons registered for work has risen by,19
NA,"more than 30,000. It is remarkable that",19
NA,the responsible Minister should talk about,19
NA,"increased employment opportunities, when,",19
NA,"on his own admittedfigures,this significant",19
NA,"increase in the number of persons seeking,",19
NA,useful employment has occurred.,19
NA,"In respect of the unemployment benefit,.",19
NA,"Mr Chairman, the same unhappy position",19
NA,"exists. In March, 1957, 13,077 persons",19
NA,"were receiving the unemployment benefit,",19
NA,which is commonly known as the dole.,19
NA,"By March of 1958, the number had risen",19
NA,"to 24,485. In July of this year, the num-",19
NA,"ber stood at 27,410. According to the",19
NA,"Minister's recent news release, the number",19
NA,of persons receiving unemployment benefit,19
NA,from the Commonwealth had fallen by,19
NA,"118 since 27th June, but I believe that a",19
NA,careful analysis of that news release will,19
NA,"show that the fact remains that, because",19
NA,"there was a reduction of 1,462 in Queens-",19
NA,"land, there must have been increases in",19
NA,all the other States. That seems to,19
NA,indicate quite conclusively that the unem-,19
NA,"ployment situation continues to deteriorate,",19
NA,in spite of what is said by Government,19
NA,spokesmen.,19
NA,There is normally a great similarity,19
NA,between the news releases made by the,19
NA,Department of Labour and National,19
NA,Service every month through the Minister.,19
NA,"Almost without exception, they refer to",19
NA,"seasonal factors, young people leaving",19
NA,school and other things affecting the,19
NA,employment situation. But I suggest at,19
NA,once that the responsible Minister is bound,19
NA,to concede that we cannot consider the,19
NA,number of young people leaving school or,19
NA,seasonal factors as being responsible for,19
NA,the serious growth in unemployment in,19
NA,this country in recent years. The problem,19
NA,goes much deeper than that. I believe,19
NA,that the important factor is the availability,19
NA,of job opportunities. The figures can be,19
NA,substantiated by reference to the various,19
NA,documents made available from time to,19
NA,time by the department.,19
NA,In February of 1958 the present,19
NA,"Treasurer, who, as I have said, was then",19
NA,"Minister for Labour and National Service,",19
NA,indicated that in that month the Cabinet,19
NA,would consider a plan for reducing unem-,19
NA,ployment. If in point of fact such a plan,19
NA,"was to be put before the Cabinet,",19
NA,obviously the Cabinet had no intention of,19
NA,"considering it seriously, even if the Cabinet",19
NA,"intended to consider it at all, because the",19
NA,-number of persons registered for employ-,20
NA,ment is certainly far higher now than it,20
NA,was at that stage. As the level of unem-,20
NA,"ployment has risen, the present Minister",20
NA,for Labour and National Service has been,20
NA,"intent, not on curbing the movement, but",20
NA,rather on finding a basis for a false com-,20
NA,parison of the unemployment figures.,20
NA,"Again, I refer to the news release made by",20
NA,the Department of Labour and National,20
NA,Service for the Minister's interpretation,20
NA,"of what is meant by the term ""Australian",20
NA,"work force "". On this point, I completely",20
NA,disagree with the Minister. In the news,20
NA,"release, he stated-",20
NA,"The Australian work force, as defined by the",20
NA,Commonwealth Statistician . . . includes em-,20
NA,"ployers, self-employed, wage and salary earners,",20
NA,"unemployed persons, and all helping in any",20
NA,"industry, business, trade or service . . .",20
NA,The Minister states that the work force,20
NA,"totals 4,000,000 persons, but I suggest that",20
NA,this figure is completely contradicted by,20
NA,that supplied by the Commonwealth Statis-,20
NA,"tician, and that the Minister's definition",20
NA,"of "" Australian work force"" has been",20
NA,invented by him in comparatively recent,20
NA,times in order to suggest a much lower,20
NA,percentage of unemployment than pre-,20
NA,viously existed. The latest monthly survey,20
NA,of employment statistics by the Bureau of,20
NA,Census and Statistics indicates that the,20
NA,total number of persons employed in,20
NA,"industry, including members of the",20
NA,"Defence Forces, is 2,984,700.",20
NA,Mr Crean -Tha t does not include rural,20
NA,"workers, either.",20
Mr BARNARD ,Tha t figure excludes,20
NA,those engaged in rural production. I sug-,20
NA,gest that if the number of persons engaged,20
NA,in rural production is included the figure,20
NA,"would certainly not exceed 3,000,000.",20
NA,Surely even the Minister and other mem-,20
NA,"bers of the Government, who, I know, take",20
NA,a great deal of convincing in these matters,20
NA,if it does not suit their purposes to be con-,20
NA,"vinced, are bound to concede that the per-",20
NA,"centage of workers unemployed, when",20
NA,"measured against the figure of 4,000,000",20
NA,for the work force-th e fictitious figure,20
NA,supplied by the head of the Department,20
NA,of Labour and National Service-i s very,20
NA,different from that obtained when it is,20
NA,"measured against the figure of 3,000,000",20
NA,supplied by the Commonwealth Statistician,20
NA,If this clumsy attempt at concealing the,20
NA,real percentage of unemployment were not,20
NA,"so serious, it could almost be described as",20
NA,humorous.,20
NA,"For seventeen consecutive months, Mr.",20
NA,"Chairman, the number of persons receiving",20
NA,the unemployment benefit has exceeded,20
NA,"24,000. Generally, it has remained close",20
NA,"to the 30,000 mark. As I indicated a few",20
NA,"moments ago, it now stands at 27,410.",20
NA,"Obviously, therefore, full employment is",20
NA,"no longer, as it should be, a fundamental",20
NA,"aim of this Government, which completely",20
NA,ignores the fact that the people of Aus-,20
NA,"tralia demand, and indeed, are entitled to",20
NA,"expect, full employment. In my opinion,",20
NA,the present level of unemployment repre-,20
NA,"sents, from the national viewpoint, a sense-",20
NA,less waste of productive power. From the,20
NA,"point of view of the individual, it means",20
NA,a loss of self-respect and of his ability to,20
NA,compete on anything approaching equal,20
NA,terms in the economic life of this country.,20
NA,"During the past two years, the Opposition",20
NA,has repeatedly directed the Government's,20
NA,attention to the rise in the unemployment,20
NA,figures and to the continuing trend towards,20
NA,"unemployment, but the Government has",20
NA,"refused to move in the matter. Obviously,",20
NA,"it accepts a situation in which, on its own",20
NA,"admitted figures, more than 60,000 persons",20
NA,are denied useful employment. I suggest,20
NA,that the Treasurer should have devoted,20
NA,more than the few lines that he did devote,20
NA,in his Budget speech to the problem of,20
NA,unemployment. He contented himself with,20
NA,a brief statement that employment had,20
NA,"risen, on the one hand, and that unem-",20
NA,"ployment had declined, on the other. I",20
NA,"believe. Sir, that I have been able to sub-",20
NA,stantiate the claim that unemployment has,20
NA,"not declined and that, on the contrary, it",20
NA,has substantially increased.,20
NA,"Let me turn now, Mr Chairman, to",20
NA,"social services. I believe that, in this",20
NA,"respect, the Budget is noteworthy more for",20
NA,what it does not do for the pensioners,20
NA,than for what it proposes to do for them.,20
NA,"For example, it proposes an increase of",20
NA,"7s. 6d. a week in age, invalid and other",20
NA,classes of pensions. Surely that can be,20
NA,"described, in the circumstances, only as",20
NA,"niggaTdly. Child endowment, for example,",20
NA,"remains unchanged, as it has done through-",20
NA,out the term of office of this Government,20
NA,"-wit h the exception, of course, of the",20
NA,"introduction, in 1950, of the endowment of",20
NA,5s. a week for the first child. But what,21
NA,is that 5s. really worth to-day? I doubt,21
NA,very much whether it would be worth even,21
NA,half of its value in 1950. The Australian,21
NA,"Labour Party, in its programme for the",21
NA,"general elections in 1958, told the people",21
NA,that it would double child endowment for,21
NA,the first child.,21
NA,Mr Mackinnon -Afte r having said on,21
NA,a previous occasion that you would never,21
NA,pay it.,21
Mr BARNARD ,Ou r policy for the,21
NA,last general elections was that the endowtotally,21
NA,ment for the second child would be,21
NA,creased from 10s. to 17s. 6d. a week and,21
NA,that the endowment for subsequent mented,21
NA,children would be increased to Â£1 a week.,21
NA,In view of the interjection just made,21
NA,"the honorable member for Corangamite, it",21
NA,"is interesting to note, on the figures",21
NA,plied by the Government in its Budget for,21
NA,"the financial year 1958-59, that these",21
NA,posals could have been financed satisfacthe,21
NA,torily. Labour's proposals were to,21
NA,"no more than Â£58,000,000. Although the",21
NA,Government budgeted originally for,21
NA,"deficit in 1958-59, the actual deficit",21
NA,not nearly so great as that budgeted for.,21
NA,"This is a clear indication to the people,",21
NA,"Mr Chairman, that our proposals in of",21
NA,respect of child endowment could have in,21
NA,"been financed, as the Government's own",21
NA,figures in that Budget indicated.,21
NA,I want to turn now to repatriation,21
NA,"benefits, Sir. The Government proposes",21
NA,increase the pensions payable to totally,21
NA,and permanently incapacitated ex-servicecountry,21
NA,men by 15s. a week. In view of the sion.,21
NA,situation in which these unfortunate people,21
NA,"find themselves to-day, we must regard",21
NA,that increase as being completely inadequate,21
NA,and insignificant. There are now no more,21
NA,"than 12,000 totally and permanently indo",21
NA,"capacitated ex-servicemen in Australia,",21
NA,and they certainly deserve from this rate,21
NA,Government far greater generosity than,21
NA,they have been accorded in this Budget.,21
NA,Their pension will be increased to Â£12 5s.,21
NA,a week. It may be said in favour of the,21
NA,Government that this is the first time,21
NA,the last three years that totally and,21
NA,manently incapacitated ex-servicemen will,21
NA,have received the benefit of the whole of,21
NA,the increase in their pension. When,21
NA,"Government, in its Budget for the finan-",21
NA,"cial year 1957-58, increased the rate of",21
NA,"this pension by 25s. a week, it did not",21
NA,"alter the ceiling limit, and this meant that",21
NA,the service pensions payable to totally and,21
NA,permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen,21
NA,and their wives were correspondingly,21
NA,"reduced. In 1958-59, the Government",21
NA,increased the rate of this pension by 15s.,21
NA,"a week, but, again, the ceiling limit was",21
NA,not altered and the benefit of the full,21
NA,increase was not received.,21
NA,This has been the experience of those,21
NA,and permanently incapacitated ex-,21
NA,inservicemen who are married and whose,21
NA,pensions are to a certain extent supple-,21
NA,by service pensions. It is perfectly,21
NA,true that single totally and permanently,21
NA,by incapacitated ex-servicemen benefited by,21
NA,"the full increase in the pension rate, but",21
NA,supthe pensions of most totally and per-,21
NA,manently incapacitated ex-servicemen are,21
NA,"prosupplemented by service pensions. So, for",21
NA,"past two years, the most deserving",21
NA,cost members of the community have been,21
NA,denied the full benefit of the increased,21
NA,a pensions granted by the Government. On,21
NA,"was this occasion, as I said a few moments",21
NA,"ago, the Government has decided to in-",21
NA,crease the ceiling limit amount to the extent,21
NA,"15s. a week, and this is the first year",21
NA,the last three in which they will be able,21
NA,to enjoy the full benefit of the increase.,21
NA,"The genera] rate pension, commonly",21
NA,"known as the 100 per cent, pension, has",21
NA,"to been increased by 7s. 6d. a week, and the",21
NA,great majority of service pensioners in this,21
NA,are being paid the general rate pen-,21
NA,What does this increase in the general,21
NA,rate pension really mean? The pensioner,21
NA,"receiving the 100 per cent, pension will",21
NA,"get the increase of 7s. 6d. a week, but",21
NA,let us see what it will mean to those who,21
NA,"not receive the full 100 per cent, pen-",21
NA,"sion. The pensioners on the 80 per cent,",21
NA,will get an increase of 6s. a week. The,21
NA,"40 per cent, pension will be increased by",21
NA,"3s. a week, and the 20 per cent, pensioner",21
NA,will get the magnificent increase of ls. 6d.,21
NA,a week. I suggest that those general rate,21
NA,in pensioners in the categories to which I,21
NA,perhave referred-an d I think they comprise,21
NA,the great majority of service pensioners in,21
NA,this country - will be extremely dis-,21
NA,appointed at the consideration they have,21
NA,the received from a Government which made,21
NA,certain promises with regard to pension,22
NA,creases in 1949.,22
NA,While the service pension is to be,22
NA,"creased to Â£4 15s. a week, the wife's allowtarget",22
NA,ance will remain at Â£3 10s. a fortnight-,22
NA,the magnificent sum of Â£1 15s. a week.,22
NA,refer again to this matter because I believe,22
NA,that those receiving these allowances repre-,22
NA,sent possibly the most deserving section,22
NA,our community. A service pensioner may,22
NA,have a war disability which is not,22
NA,sidered by the Repatriation Department,22
NA,sufficientiy grave to render him completely,22
NA,"incapacitated, but it may render him inthis",22
NA,capable of engaging in useful employment.,22
NA,If his wife is under 60 years of age she,22
NA,expected to exist on Â£3 10s. a fortnight.,22
NA,I agree with the comments made last night,22
NA,by the honorable member for Port Ademitted.,22
NA,"laide ( Mr Thompson), who suggested",22
NA,the Minister for Social Services ( Mr.,22
NA,"Roberton), who is now sitting at the table,",22
NA,"that he might, even at this late stage,",22
NA,consider the plight in which these pepole,22
NA,to whom I have referred now find themHomes Division.,22
NA,selves.,22
NA,There is one other theme that I,22
NA,like to develop in the few minutes that,22
NA,main to me. I refer to the question,22
NA,housing. I know that the Commonwealth,22
NA,Government has great difficulty in some,22
NA,respects in legislating to deal with recesIn,22
NA,"sions that occur, both internally and",22
NA,"ternally, because of constitutional limitahas",22
NA,tions of power. But there is one power,22
NA,that is certainly available to this Governwe,22
NA,ment. There is no restriction on its power,22
NA,in respect of the provision of homes for,22
NA,the people of this country. I remember,22
NA,"that in 1956 the Minister for National Deincreasing,",22
NA,velopment (Senator Spooner) presented to,22
NA,the people of this country a document,22
NA,"entitled ""The Housing Situation"". The",22
NA,"Minister pointed out in that document that, a home.",22
NA,as a result of the natural increase in popu-,22
NA,lation and the increase resulting from the,22
NA,"immigration programme, the demand for",22
NA,"houses would rise from 60,000 in 1961 to expired.",22
NA,"86,000 in 1975. He said also that a steady",22
NA,"rate of 77,000 homes completed each year",22
NA,would be needed if we were to reach the,22
NA,"target. What has happened? In 1956, the",22
NA,year that the Minister made this document,22
NA,available and suggested that the minimum,22
NA,"annual requirement would be 77,000 shall",22
NA,"inhomes, only 73,000 homes were built. In",22
NA,"the following year, only 70,000 homes were",22
NA,"built, but it is true that in the next year,",22
NA,"in1958, home construction exceeded the",22
NA,"of 77,000 by approximately 2,000.",22
NA,"However, we are falling further behind",22
NA,I each year in the race to provide homes.,22
NA,Let me refer to the fields in which the,22
NA,of Commonwealth Government has some,22
NA,responsibility for housing. I refer first to,22
NA,"conwar service homes, for which the Com-",22
NA,monwealth accepted full responsibility.,22
NA,The amount of money to be made available,22
NA,year for the construcion of war service,22
NA,"homes is Â£35,000,000; it has remained at",22
NA,"is this figure since 1957-58. In 1957-58,",22
NA,"22,399 applications for assistance through",22
NA,the War Service Homes Division were sub-,22
NA,"At the end of that year, 19,257",22
NA,to outstanding applications remained. In,22
NA,"other words, the War Service Homes Divi-",22
NA,sion was able to make up the leeway only,22
NA,"to the extent of about 3,000 homes. I",22
NA,"rerefer, of course, to those who want to",22
NA,build their homes through the War Service,22
NA,Let me refer to the difficulties that face,22
NA,"would these people. In 1955, the maximum",22
NA,readvance fixed by the responsible Minister,22
NA,"of was Â£2,750. In those days, the maximum",22
NA,"advance exceeded the cost of the home,",22
NA,but to-day it is far below the average cost.,22
NA,"one State alone, New South Wales, the",22
NA,exaverage cost of a dwelling-house and land,22
NA,increased each year until it is now,22
NA,"Â£3,763, requiring a deposit of Â£1,013. If",22
NA,want to give the people the assistance,22
NA,to which they are entitled through the,22
NA,"War Service Homes Division, obviously the",22
NA,Government must consider immediately,22
NA,"first, the amount it makes avail-",22
NA,able each year for the construction of war,22
NA,"service homes and, secondly, the maximum",22
NA,advance to enable these people to purchase,22
The CHAIRMAN , Mr Bowden) -,22
NA,Order! The honorable member's time has,22
Mr WILSON ,Sturt) [11.48] -A s I pro-,22
NA,pose to praise certain items in the Budget,22
NA,"and to criticize others, I want to define",22
NA,"my position clearly at the outset. I am,",22
NA,"Sir, a member of the Liberal Party, the con-",22
NA,stitution of which provides that members,22
NA,be free in all things to act and vote,22
NA,according to the dictates of their con-,23
NA,science. I would not be a member of a,23
NA,party that prevented me at any time from,23
NA,freely expressing my views. It is most,23
NA,regrettable that the Australian Labour,23
NA,Party does not similarly leave its members,23
NA,free. These constant expulsions from the,23
NA,Australian Labour Party because members,23
NA,conscientiously express their views are,23
NA,extremely bad for democracy. The ability,23
NA,of members freely to express their views,23
NA,shows a healthy party and a healthy,23
NA,democracy.,23
NA,At the same time I am a team man.,23
NA,"If, having freely expressed my views, I",23
NA,am unable to convince the majority of my,23
NA,"party that my views are right, as a team",23
NA,man I normally accept the decision of the,23
NA,team. I am not always right and I am,23
NA,not always wrong. When to-day I criticize,23
NA,"certain items in the Budget, that does not",23
NA,"mean that I will vote against it, because",23
NA,I recognize that it is the combined thinking,23
NA,of members of the Cabinet who have the,23
NA,responsibility to present it. I do not believe,23
NA,that any member of the Cabinet agrees with,23
NA,every item in the Budget. It would be,23
NA,unreal to think that that were so. But,23
NA,the Budget is the combined decision of the,23
NA,"members of the Cabinet, in whom I have",23
NA,confidence and for whom I have respect.,23
NA,"At the outset, I say that I cannot agree",23
NA,with the general approach of Cabinet that,23
NA,"this is a deficit budget. On the contrary,",23
NA,I believe it shows that thefinancialposition,23
NA,of Australia is stronger to-day than at any,23
NA,time in our history. The figures on pages,23
NA,10 and 11 of the current report of the,23
NA,"Auditor-General, which deals with the",23
NA,financial position for the year ended 30th,23
NA,"June, 1959, show that, despite low wool",23
NA,"prices and a year following a drought, the",23
NA,Commonwealth reduced its public debt by,23
NA,"Â£86,000,000 and that treasury-bills",23
NA,"increased by Â£36,000,000. This gives a net",23
NA,improvement in our balance-sheet of,23
NA,"Â£50,000,000 for one year. In addition to",23
NA,"that, we paid out of revenue for public",23
NA,"works, for which there are corresponding",23
NA,"assets, Â£132,000,000. The real position,",23
NA,"therefore, is that the Commonwealth's",23
NA,assets over liabilities in one year improved,23
NA,"by Â£182,000,000. I fail to understand",23
NA,why Treasury officials are continually,23
NA,altering the manner in which these figures,23
NA,are presented. This is apparently done in,23
NA,an effort to create a situation that is suitable,23
NA,to themselves. I would say that the figures,23
NA,for the financial year ended 30th June last,23
NA,are probably the most satisfactory that have,23
NA,"ever been presented, and I do not see any",23
NA,reason to tell the world that Australia has,23
NA,a deficit when last year Australia showed,23
NA,that it was able to reduce its liabilities or,23
NA,add to its assets by an amount of,23
NA,"Â£182,000,000.",23
NA,Although the approach has been changed,23
NA,"and a new item added, a critical examina-",23
NA,tion of the Budget for this year shows that,23
NA,the revenue of the Commonwealth for the,23
NA,"year will be Â£1,385,000,000 and that",23
NA,expenditure will be a like amount. But on,23
NA,the expenditure side we find an item of,23
NA,"Â£142,000,000 which will be spent on capital",23
NA,"works. Once again, Australia's balance-",23
NA,sheet in this year is shown to improve to,23
NA,"the extent of Â£142,000,000 in assets over",23
NA,liabilities. The loan account shows that,23
NA,we expect to spend on works and housing,23
NA,"Â£220,000,000 and on war service land",23
NA,"settlement Â£7,000,000, making a total for",23
NA,"these two items of Â£227,000,000. We",23
NA,expect to raise from loan funds,23
NA,"Â£190,000,000 and from sinking fund",23
NA,"Â£46,000,000, so that the loan account also",23
NA,"shows a surplus of Â£9,000,000.",23
NA,"Some one may then ask, "" How is it that",23
NA,the Treasurer comes forward and says that,23
NA,"we have a deficit of Â£61,000,000?"" This is",23
NA,how he arrived at it: I pointed out that,23
NA,our revenue and expenditure account,23
NA,"balances, that we have a Â£9,000,000 esti-",23
NA,mated surplus over the Loan Account but,23
NA,we expect we will have to pay off maturing,23
NA,"securities amounting to Â£70,000,000. The",23
NA,Treasury officials say that if we deduct the,23
NA,"Â£9,000,000 surplus in the Loan Account",23
NA,"from the Â£70,000,000 we have to pay off",23
NA,"our liabilities, the result is a cash deficit of",23
NA,"Â£61,000,000. Of course, it is a cash deficit",23
NA,and it reminds me of the man who has an,23
NA,"income of Â£2,000 a year and whose expen-",23
NA,"diture is Â£1,000 a year, in addition to",23
NA,"which he pays off Â£1,500 of the mortgage",23
NA,"on his house and then says, "" I have had a",23
NA,"terrible year; I have a cash deficit of Â£500 "".",23
NA,If we are going to pay off our past liabilities,23
NA,at the rate that we have been and are paying,23
NA,"them off, of course we will go on having a",23
NA,cash deficit.,23
NA,I am not questioning the decision which,23
NA,the Treasury has made. I realize that there,23
NA,is a distinct danger of inflation and that if,24
NA,a considerable amount of cash is placed in,24
NA,the hands of the people this would create,24
NA,"new purchasing power and, in turn, could",24
NA,stimulate inflation. I think the proper ap-,24
NA,proach to this Budget is to regard its real,24
NA,objective as anti-inflationary. It is a sur-,24
NA,"plus budget and not a deficient budget, but",24
NA,it is one by which we are paying off our,24
NA,past liabilities because we realize that under,24
NA,present conditions our main and prime ob-,24
NA,"jective is to keep down costs. Therefore,",24
NA,we must not inject more money than is,24
NA,necessary into the community. If that is,24
NA,the true approach behind the Treasury,24
NA,"thinking, as I believe it must be, I feel",24
NA,such concessions as were to be given in the,24
NA,Budget should have been given with that,24
NA,"in mind, namely, the reduction of costs",24
NA,and the checking of inflation. Inflation is,24
NA,tbe most deadly thing in the country. It,24
NA,robs the worker of his wages and the,24
NA,thrifty of their savings. We have seen far,24
NA,too much inflation in the past. Under the,24
NA,previous Labour Government prices were,24
NA,"going up at the rate of 10 per cent, per",24
NA,annum. In the early days of this Govern-,24
NA,ment they continued to go up at the rate,24
NA,"of 10 per cent, per annum until finally the",24
NA,Government took stern action to steady,24
NA,costs. But we find that they are still rising,24
NA,"at the rate of about 2 i per cent, per annum.",24
NA,I believe that this Budget should have been,24
NA,"designed to reduce costs. Therefore, I",24
NA,would have liked to see reductions made in,24
NA,"sales tax, because this directly affects the",24
NA,cost of production. I think particularly of,24
NA,sales tax on foodstuffs and furniture and,24
NA,other items which are necessary to the,24
NA,well-being of the community.,24
NA,I now turn to the social service pro-,24
NA,visions. Every honorable member will,24
NA,support the 7s. 6d. a week increase in pen-,24
NA,sions because every one realizes that some,24
NA,increase is absolutely essential. Some,24
NA,people have quibbled at the amount of the,24
NA,increase. My main objection is that it has,24
NA,been unscientific. I do not think it is good,24
NA,enough to pick a figure out of a hat and,24
NA,"say "" We will give them 7s. 6d. more "". I",24
NA,have said repeatedly in this chamber that,24
NA,the time is long overdue when there should,24
NA,"be age security for all, provided on a con-",24
NA,tributory basis and free of the means test.,24
NA,"I do not withdraw one word of that, and I",24
NA,will continue to advocate it so long as I,24
NA,am a member of this Parliament. The last,24
NA,Labour Government was in office for eight,24
NA,years but it did nothing about abolishing,24
NA,the means test. The present Government,24
NA,has been in office now for nearly ten years,24
NA,and although it has liberalized the means,24
NA,test from time to time it has not yet brought,24
NA,in a contributory plan in accordance with,24
NA,its policy. If the Government intends to,24
NA,"retain this cruel and unjust means test, I",24
NA,suggest that if the pension is to be based on,24
NA,needs the needs should be accurately,24
NA,measured.,24
NA,"Under the present legislation, a married",24
NA,couple receiving Â£7 a week in wages or,24
NA,that superannuation and also Â£8 15s. a week in,24
NA,"pension- a total income of Â£15 15s. a week,",24
NA,which is Â£2 odd in excess of the basic,24
NA,wage-i s now to have that amount,24
NA,"increased to Â£16 10s. a week, which is",24
NA,approximately Â£3 in excess of the basic,24
NA,wage. Can any honorable member say,24
NA,that the needs of that couple are as great,24
NA,as the needs of the widow in receipt of,24
NA,Â£4 7s. 6d. now to be increased to Â£4 15s.,24
NA,a week? If we are going to measure pen-,24
NA,"sions according to need, let us measure",24
NA,"needs truly and properly and scientifically,",24
NA,not giving some people Â£3 a week more,24
NA,"than the basic wage and keeping others,",24
NA,"such as widows, single aged and invalids,",24
NA,"down to Â£4 15s. a week. In addition, we",24
NA,"find that the thrifty, in many cases, are",24
NA,worse off than they were before. A widow,24
NA,"who has saved and invested Â£2,300, which",24
NA,"brings in an income of Â£115 a year, has",24
NA,to try to live on that income or eat into her,24
NA,"capital. She receives no pension at all,",24
NA,but a person who has saved nothing receives,24
NA,Â£4 15s. a week. I believe that our present,24
NA,social service legislation. imposes cruel,24
NA,injustices upon the thrifty. How can we,24
NA,expect people to save when they are,24
NA,penalized to such an extent by the means,24
NA,test?,24
NA,There are two ways of removing this,24
NA,injustice. One is to abolish the means test,24
NA,altogether and have a contributory plan of,24
NA,age security under which every aged,24
NA,"person, regardless of means, will receive",24
NA,superannuation because he or she has paid,24
NA,for it. Need will not be relevant. The,24
NA,sum received will be similar to the super-,24
NA,annuation of the public servant or the,24
NA,member of Parliament. They paid for their,24
NA,superannuation and they receive it as of,24
NA,right. The other way is to liberalize the,24
NA,means test so that justice is done to the,25
NA,thrifty as well as to the thriftless. At,25
NA,"present, an aged person loses Â£1 a year of",25
NA,pension for every Â£10 of capital that he,25
NA,"possesses in excess of Â£200. No person,",25
NA,"whether aged or young, can safely invest",25
NA,"his money at 10 per .cent, interest. The",25
NA,aged person who has saved during his,25
NA,working life is worse off than the aged,25
NA,person who has not saved at all. If the,25
NA,capital means test were so liberalized as to,25
NA,provide for a reduction of Â£1 a year in,25
NA,pension for every Â£20 of capital in excess,25
NA,"of Â£200-i n other words, 5 per cent -th e",25
NA,thrifty man would be in no worse position,25
NA,than he who had not saved during his,25
NA,working life. Every one knows that 5 per,25
NA,"cent, interest may be obtained on govern-",25
NA,"ment loans, so people with a little capital",25
NA,would have no hesitation in supporting go-,25
NA,vernment loans in the knowledge that by,25
NA,doing so they would not be affecting their,25
NA,pension rights.,25
NA,I know that it is too late now for my,25
NA,suggestion to be incorporated in the Bud-,25
NA,"get, but I ask the Treasurer and the Go-",25
NA,"vernment to liberalize the means test, if not",25
NA,"to abolish it altogether, so that the thrifty",25
NA,will have an income at least equal to that,25
NA,of the spendthrifts. My suggestion also,25
NA,envisages the removal of the present ceiling,25
NA,"of Â£2,250 worth of assets that may be",25
NA,owned by a person seeking a pension. If,25
NA,"the Government saw fit to do so, it could",25
NA,implement these reforms at a cost of only,25
NA,"a few millions of pounds, much less than",25
NA,the amount involved in its present pro-,25
NA,posals.,25
NA,I congratulate the Government on Its,25
NA,decision to make hospital benefits available,25
NA,to all aged and chronically ill persons,25
NA,whether or not they are in recognized hos-,25
NA,pitals. It is the illness that justifies the,25
NA,"assistance, not the bed in the hospital in",25
NA,which the sick person lies. I appreciate,25
NA,the Government's action in concurring in,25
NA,the views that have been expressed by some,25
NA,of us in this Parliament who have felt so,25
NA,strongly about certain aged and chronically,25
NA,ill persons being denied hospital benefits,25
NA,simply because they have been in hospitals,25
NA,"which, for purposes of the legislation, were",25
NA,not recognized by the Government.,25
NA,The Government is to be congratulated,25
NA,<dso on its decision to allow additional,25
NA,tention allowances to private companies,25
NA,without incurring penalty tax. In this coun-,25
NA,try we need most of all capital-i n other,25
NA,"words, savings-an d anything that can be",25
NA,done to encourage savings adds to employ-,25
NA,ment and the development of Australia.,25
NA,"Obviously, it is difficult to induce people",25
NA,to save when we penalize them by the,25
NA,application of the means test. We must,25
NA,-realize that we cannot develop our country,25
NA,unless we have adequate capital to provide,25
NA,the new equipment that is necessary to,25
NA,maintain employment in our industries. I,25
NA,congratulate the Government on increasing,25
NA,the amount of tax deduction for super-,25
NA,annuation and insurance payments.,25
NA,I support also the proposals regarding,25
NA,pharmaceutical benefits under which sub-,25
NA,stantially all prescriptions written by a,25
NA,doctor will be dispensed at a cost of 5s.,25
NA,each. I am sure that the community will,25
NA,accept that charge as a necessary check,25
NA,on those people who have been inclined,25
NA,to spend the taxpayers' money unneces-,25
NA,sarily on drugs that were not really re-,25
NA,quired to deal with the particular com-,25
NA,plaint under treatment.,25
NA,My main criticism of the Budget is that,25
NA,it is too conservative. In a progressive,25
NA,"country such as ours we could have taken,",25
NA,"perhaps, a few more risks. I have such",25
NA,"confidence in the future of Australia, with",25
NA,"its expanding production, that I am sure",25
NA,that we have been somewhat over-cautious.,25
NA,My great disappointment is that nothing,25
NA,has been done to liberalize the means test,25
NA,so as to help the thrifty members of our,25
NA,"community. In fact, this Budget places",25
NA,the thrifty at an even greater disadvantage,25
NA,than they were before.,25
Mr DAVIES ,Braddon) [12.11] -A s a,25
NA,relative newcomer to this Parliament I,25
NA,should like to congratulate the honorable,25
NA,member for Griffith ( Mr Chresby) on the,25
NA,maiden speech that he delivered last week.,25
NA,The Australian Labour Party is opposed,25
NA,to the Budget because it favours the large,25
NA,undertakings and gives no relief to the,25
NA,"family man, the primary producer or indus-",25
NA,try generally. We have been told so often,25
NA,"of the so-called prosperity of Australia, but",25
NA,this is a myth to the pensioners and those,25
NA,on fixed and low incomes. If Australia is,25
NA,reas financially buoyant as we have been,25
NA,"told by the Government, why have not",26
NA,greater concessions been made to the little,26
NA,people? The honorable member for,26
NA,Bowman ( Mr MCColm) was right in his,26
NA,description of the Budget as a thimble and,26
NA,pea Budget. Many people have looked for,26
NA,the pea-som e real concession-bu t have,26
NA,failed to find it. The concessions that,26
NA,"have been granted, amounting to",26
NA,"Â£25,000,000 in a full year, will be offset",26
NA,"by more than Â£20,000,000 representing in-",26
NA,creased charges imposed on the people.,26
NA,Increased telephone charges will cost the,26
NA,"people Â£13,000,000 a year. That amount",26
NA,will increase greatly the huge profits that,26
NA,are being made already in the telephone,26
NA,section of the Postmaster-General's Depart-,26
NA,"ment. In 1957-58, the last year for which",26
NA,"figures are available, the telephone section",26
NA,"showed a profit of Â£6,294,000 on a total",26
NA,"revenue of Â£56,504,000.",26
NA,The reconstituted scheme of pharmaceuti-,26
NA,"cal benefits, by which people will be charged",26
NA,5s. for each prescription written for them,26
NA,"by a doctor, will cost the people about",26
NA,"Â£4,000,000 and will place a heavy burden",26
NA,on the family man who is now trying to,26
NA,exist on the basic wage. It is a scathing,26
NA,indictment of this Government that in an,26
NA,era of so-called prosperity the sick should,26
NA,be taxed to provide revenue to bolster the,26
NA,finances of the country.,26
NA,The new postage rates are expected to,26
NA,"yield about Â£5,000,000. The Prime Minis-",26
NA,ter ( Mr Menzies) last week announced,26
NA,certain modifications to the proposals out-,26
NA,"lined by the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt),",26
NA,but the bulk postage rate will remain at,26
NA,double the previous rate.,26
NA,In my electorate the country newspapers,26
NA,"- I call to mind the "" King Island News "",",26
NA,"the "" Circular Head Chronicle"", the",26
NA,""" Tasmanian Farmer"" and the leading",26
NA,newspaper in northern and western Tas-,26
NA,"mania, "" The Advocate ""-ar e doing an",26
NA,"excellent job, but they will be hard hit by",26
NA,these impositions. The newspaper is a vital,26
NA,"means of information and communication,",26
NA,"not only for city dwellers but also, and",26
NA,"more particularly, for people in country",26
NA,areas. All honorable members will remem-,26
NA,ber the effect of the economy drive intro-,26
NA,duced by the Postmaster-General ( Mr.,26
NA,"Davidson) earlier this year, which meant",26
NA,that certain mail deliveries were curtailed,26
NA,on public holidays. Country people,26
NA,suffered because they were denied their,26
NA,newspapers. I hope that the Government,26
NA,will reconsider its proposals before bring-,26
NA,ing down enacting legislation. One news-,26
NA,"paper in my electorate pays Â£6,000 a year",26
NA,"in postage, half of which amount is met by",26
NA,the subscribers and the other half by the-,26
NA,newspaper itself. The increased postage,26
NA,will double the amount previously paid:,26
NA,"and under the policy of the newspaper,",26
NA,"half of the additional charge of Â£12,000-",26
NA,will be met by the subscribers and the other,26
NA,half by the newspaper. Advertising rates,26
NA,"must rise because, when we take into con-",26
NA,sideration the recent increase of 15s. in the,26
NA,"basic wage, the pending margins claim and",26
NA,"these increased postage rates, the newspaper",26
NA,will have no other course open to it. Of,26
NA,"course, the average people will be the ones",26
NA,who suffer.,26
NA,The increased postage and telephone,26
NA,charges are estimated to cost Tasmanians,26
NA,"alone Â£1,000,000 a year. This will be hard",26
NA,"for Tasmanian industry, because of its",26
NA,distance from established markets. It is,26
NA,not fair to the people who manufacture in,26
NA,Tasmania and who have to compete with,26
NA,those on the mainland who are not worried,26
NA,by high freights. The president of the,26
NA,Hobart Chamber of Commerce this week,26
NA,expressed the concern being felt by indus-,26
NA,try all over the State. He has been,26
NA,reported as follows:-,26
NA,The sharp and unexpected rise in both the,26
NA,postal and telephone charges appeared to be an,26
NA,unaccountable action on the part of the Govern-,26
NA,ment that should be aware of the increasing,26
NA,necessity to reduce working costs. The increased,26
NA,charges would wipe out the benefits of reduced,26
NA,income tax and would increase the direct cost of,26
NA,all manufactured and commercial articles.,26
NA,"Again, tiie consumer will be the loser,",26
NA,"From calculations that have been made,",26
NA,private telephone subscribers in towns in,26
NA,my electorate are expected to pay from Â£5,26
NA,to Â£6 more a year for calls and about Â£2,26
NA,more in rentals. The family man will,26
NA,carry a double burden-increase s in his,26
NA,own telephone and postage rates and those,26
NA,passed on in the cost of the articles which,26
NA,he purchases. The effects will be Australia-,26
NA,"wide. The "" Mercury"", which is printed",26
NA,"in Hobart, quotes some alarming possible",26
NA,effects of the rises. It says-,26
NA,One large mail order firm in Australia has,26
NA,already negotiated a contract with a Dutch print-,26
NA,ing Arm to produce its catalogue to be posted,26
NA,to Australians from Holland.,26
NA,Two large Australian retail firms are planning,27
NA,to have catalogues and mail order material printed,27
NA,in New Zealand and posted from Auckland to,27
NA,Australian addresses because the cost of postage,27
NA,would be much lower.,27
NA,One world-famous monthly magazine which,27
NA,reprints in Australia will be involved in more,27
NA,"that Â£100,000 extra a year in postage and may",27
NA,be obliged to make its distribution arrangements,27
NA,for Australians outside Australia.,27
NA,The Christmas card trade will be heavily hit.,27
NA,It' is claimed that as the average cost of a,27
NA,"Christmas card is 4d., the postage will be higher",27
NA,than the cost of a card.,27
NA,"After analysis of this Budget, it will be",27
NA,seen that the concessions which have been,27
NA,given by the Treasurer with one hand have,27
NA,been taken away with the other. With,27
NA,"regard to industry, there has been no",27
NA,"alleviation of company, pay-roll, or sales",27
NA,"tax, and no relief through depreciation",27
NA,"allowances. Instead, industry is now faced",27
NA,with considerable increases in expenses,27
NA,through extra telephone and postage,27
NA,charges. These will inevitably be added,27
NA,on to the cost structure although higher,27
NA,costs are already gradually pricing our pro-,27
NA,ducts out of world markets.,27
NA,The pension increase of 7s. 6d. a week,27
NA,considerably less than should have been,27
NA,awarded and is resented by all sections,27
NA,the community. The most disappointing,27
NA,and disconcerting feature of this social,27
NA,services programme is the failure to,27
NA,crease child endowment and so extend,27
NA,"some of the so-called "" social justice""",27
NA,the family unit. Allowance for the,27
NA,"child has not changed for nine years and,",27
NA,"for the second and the subsequent children,",27
NA,it has not changed for ten years. Yet costs,27
NA,"have risen at least 100 per cent, in the",27
NA,time!,27
NA,"The Opposition condemns, also, the",27
NA,failure of the Government to grant a rise,27
NA,the wives of invalid pensioners. They still,27
NA,receive a miserable 35s. a week for caring,27
NA,"for the sick. I had hoped, too, that",27
NA,common justice to men who are still sufferto,27
NA,ing from war sacrifices involving injury,27
NA,"or illness, they would be given a pension",27
NA,equal at least to the basic wage. Howtion,27
NA,"ever, we find that these totally and permarkets,",27
NA,manently incapacitated pensioners will,27
NA,"ceive only an extra 15s. per week, leaving",27
NA,them 31s. per week less than the basic,27
NA,wage. This is typical of the approach,27
NA,made by this Government to repatriation,27
NA,(benefits and to the whole question of,27
NA,service benefits as well.,27
NA,Honorable members on this side of the,27
NA,chamber have dealt at length with the effect,27
NA,"of the 5 per cent, reduction in income",27
NA,tax rates and have shown what little effect,27
NA,it will have on family income in a period,27
NA,of rising prices. I had hoped that workers',27
NA,fares to and from work would be an allow-,27
NA,able tax deduction. I listened with great,27
NA,interest to the very able speech by the,27
NA,honorable member for Parkes ( Mr Haylen),27
NA,on Tuesday evening on the subject of taxa-,27
NA,tion deductions. I am concerned about the,27
NA,"workers in places such as Devonport,",27
NA,"Ulverstone, and Wynyard who pay as",27
NA,much as Â£1 a week out of their wages in,27
NA,travelling expenses to and from the Asso-,27
NA,ciated Pulp and Paper Mills in Burnie.,27
NA,This is a considerable amount when we,27
NA,"realize how other costs of living, borne by",27
NA,"the workers in this country, have risen. At",27
NA,"the same time, business executives run cars",27
NA,and charge them up to company expenses,27
NA,as tax deductions.,27
NA,"I desire merely to add, regarding taxa-",27
NA,"tion, that the tax structure is changing",27
NA,rapidly from one of direct taxation to one,27
NA,is of indirect taxation and that the consumer,27
NA,-th e wage-earner-i s bearing too great a,27
NA,of burden because of the imposition of sales,27
NA,tax on practically all items-includin g,27
NA,even school requisites-an d because of,27
NA,inexcise and customs duties. These latter,27
NA,"imposts raised Â£208,000,000 last year and",27
NA,"to the average payment per person was Â£29,",27
NA,first or more than l i s . a week.,27
NA,I turn now to the position of primary,27
NA,producers in this country. The Treasurer,27
NA,same has glossed over the reduced income posi-,27
NA,tion of primary producers with a passing,27
NA,reference to increased rural production.,27
NA,"In reviewing the progress of the economy,",27
NA,to the Treasurer said that 1958-59 had been a,27
NA,"notable year for rural production, and later",27
NA,he referred to the higher rural output and,27
NA,in the large volume of commodities that had,27
NA,be sold. The stark fact is that although,27
NA,Australian farmers have proved that they,27
NA,"can produce the goods, the costs of produc-",27
NA,are pricing these goods out of world,27
NA,with a consequent drop in income,27
NA,"reto the farmers. Actually, farm income, at",27
NA,"Â£399,000,000, was the second lowest that",27
NA,has been recorded in the past ten years.,27
NA,A study of the graph on page 6 of the,27
NA,"social paper, "" National Income and Expendi-",27
NA,"ture"", reveals very plainly that over the",27
NA,past ten years wages and salaries have,28
NA,"shown a gradual upward trend, in keeping",28
NA,"with company and other business income,",28
NA,"but that farm income, apart from two",28
NA,"seasons, has shown several depressions.",28
NA,The latest figures that are available from,28
NA,the Bureau of Agricultural Economics show,28
NA,"that in Tasmania 20 per cent, of the",28
NA,primary producers earn incomes below,28
NA,"Â£500 per annum and 61 per cent, earn",28
NA,"below Â£1,000 per annum. For the whole",28
NA,"of Australia, IS per cent, of primary pro-",28
NA,ducers earn incomes below Â£500 per,28
NA,"annum and 55 per cent, earn below Â£1,000",28
NA,per annum.,28
NA,We heard talk of expansion in the,28
NA,"Treasurer's speech, but what encourage-",28
NA,ment is given to people to develop the food,28
NA,bowl of the north of Australia through,28
NA,increased tax concessions to people who go,28
NA,into those areas and develop them? What,28
NA,incentive is given to young people to,28
NA,develop farms in marginal areas? It is not,28
NA,"uncommon in my electorate and, I believe,",28
NA,"throughout Australia, for a young farmer",28
NA,on a property of 400 acres to have to meet,28
NA,yearly commitments of approximately,28
NA,"Â£2,000, made up of capital repayments",28
NA,"and bank interest, before making a penny",28
NA,for ordinary living expenses or for develop-,28
NA,ment. I had great hopes of the Common-,28
NA,wealth Bank and the Commonwealth,28
NA,Development Bank introducing for civilians,28
NA,schemes of land development similar to the,28
NA,"war service land settlement scheme, but",28
NA,money is just as hard to get now. No,28
NA,"doubt, it is still being channelled by the",28
NA,private trading banks into the more lucra-,28
NA,tive fields of hire purchase.,28
NA,"Farmers, to-day, look upon the Post-",28
NA,master-General's Department as a taxing,28
NA,medium. They are obliged to use tele-,28
NA,phones a great deal owing to their distance,28
NA,from merchants and other suppliers. Now,28
NA,they will be forced to pay more for,28
NA,telephone calls and postage. The news-,28
NA,papers and periodicals used by these people,28
NA,"invariably go through the post, so, by",28
NA,"having to pay additional postage, these",28
NA,pioneers of the outback are to be penalized,28
NA,further by this Liberal-Country Party,28
NA,Government. Increases incurred by busi-,28
NA,"ness houses, too, will inevitably be passed",28
NA,"on to farmers and consumers and, to-day,",28
NA,this is a serious matter. A great proportion,28
NA,"of farmers, as I have shown, are not making",28
NA,the basic wage although their wives and,28
NA,children may assist them with production.,28
NA,Yet we find no relief for them in this,28
NA,Budget!,28
NA,The Minister for Primary Industry ( Mr.,28
NA,Adermann) in his speech on the Budget,28
NA,said-,28
NA,Our undisputed objective is to raise Australia's,28
NA,economy to the level of the economy of a great,28
NA,nation. The policies enunciated in the Budget are,28
NA,aimed at the achievement of this objective . . .,28
NA,The important factors necessary to the attainment,28
NA,"of our objective are, first, vitality and, secondly,",28
NA,a generally sound structure of rural industries.,28
NA,Neither of these objectives receives any sup-,28
NA,port or stimulus in this Budget. Nothing is,28
NA,"done to give relief, halt rising costs, or pre-",28
NA,vent this creeping inflation. Serious con-,28
NA,cern is felt for the Tasmanian apple,28
NA,industry in this regard. I feel that it will,28
NA,do no harm to acquaint honorable mem-,28
NA,bers with a few facts showing how rising,28
NA,costs in recent years are pricing us out of,28
NA,overseas markets. It costs 8s. 6d. to pack,28
NA,"a case of apples. This covers the case,",28
NA,"straw boards, wrapping paper, grading and",28
NA,nailing. Freight on a case of apples from,28
NA,the packing shed to England is 15s. lOd.,28
NA,and an average of 5s. commission for sales,28
NA,in that country is charged. The costs on a,28
NA,"case of apples, therefore, total Â£1 9s. 4d.",28
NA,before the grower gets a penny for his,28
NA,fruit or any return toward the cost of,28
NA,"manures, sprays and general cultivation.",28
NA,These costs have been averaged out by a,28
NA,group of orchardists in the Huon Valley.,28
NA,I know of some growers who are receiving,28
NA,12s. in the shed. If we subtract the 8s. 6d.,28
NA,"costs for presentation of a case of apples,",28
NA,the grower is left with 3s. 6d. a case for his,28
NA,fruit and to cover production costs. The,28
NA,importance of this industry to our overseas,28
NA,balance of trade is seen from the fact that,28
NA,"the 1958 crop was worth Â£7,164,000 and",28
NA,"that 4,388,000 cases were exported over-",28
NA,"seas of a total crop of 6,641,000 cases.",28
NA,"Recently, an honorable senator who sup-",28
NA,"ports the Government, when speaking in",28
NA,"another place, stated that the price received",28
NA,for Australian apples in England and,28
NA,Europe had collapsed at the end of last,28
NA,season. He said that many of the,28
NA,recognized buyers had stated that they were,28
NA,not anxious to buy Australian apples in the.,28
NA,"future and were recommending Australian,",28
NA,growers to send their fruit on consignment.,28
NA,I only hope that this will never mean a,28
NA,return to pre-war conditions when growers,29
NA,often received a debit return instead of a,29
NA,credit for their exports. I know one classic,29
NA,case of a grower who consigned 200 cases,29
NA,and received a bill for 2s. 6d. In the,29
NA,"interests of this industry, the Government",29
NA,should do -everything possible to reduce,29
NA,costs. The Department of Trade should,29
NA,investigate overseas freight rates with a,29
NA,"view to their reduction, and should explore",29
NA,every possible avenue for new markets.,29
NA,"It is very pleasing to note that, at",29
NA,"opening wool sales on Monday, prices were",29
NA,"from 12i per cent, to 15 per cent, up on",29
NA,last season's closing levels. It is to,29
NA,hoped that the market will remain buoyant.,29
NA,The opening prices were higher than those,29
NA,expected but are still below those that,29
NA,obtained in 1957. According to informaTreasurer,29
NA,"tion published in "" Wool Facts "", a publicaunder",29
NA,tion compiled by the Australian Woolduced,29
NA,"growers' Council, the value of wool the",29
NA,exported in the twelve months ended 30th,29
NA,"June, 1959, was Â£302,000,000 compared congenial",29
NA,"with Â£373,000,000 for 1957-58, a drop of",29
NA,"19 per cent. The value of wool exports,",29
NA,"a proportion of our total export income,",29
NA,"fell from 46 per cent, in 1957-58 to",29
NA,"per cent, in 1958-59.",29
NA,Beef exports to the United Kingdom and,29
NA,to the United States of America have,29
NA,"reached an all time record, but experts are",29
NA,now warning exporters that they should,29
NA,regard the American market with caution.,29
NA,Prices American buyers are prepared to pay,29
NA,"are now falling, and sales are becoming",29
NA,more difficult to effect. One research,29
NA,mittee in the United States of America,29
NA,recently predicted that if the herd increase,29
NA,"continued at the present rate, prices for",29
NA,meat could fall by 50 per cent. This,29
NA,vernment must do all in its power to bring,29
NA,stability to our rural industries because,29
NA,must export to live and these rural exports,29
NA,form the bulk of our overseas balance of,29
NA,payments. The fat lamb industry is faced,29
NA,"this season with depressed prices. Lambs,",29
NA,"at an average of Â£2 each, are a losing",29
NA,position. Many other crops such as pinebring,29
NA,"apples, potatoes, and bananas are in",29
NA,same category and yet this Budget which,29
NA,"said to be "" directed to the twin purposes of",29
NA,"expansion and stability"", allows for no",29
NA,concession for primary producers. Potaof,29
NA,toes were once the staple crop of the northcession.,29
NA,"west coast of Tasmania, but the area",29
NA,planted with potatoes in that district in,29
NA,"1958-59 was down to 16,186 acres. This is",29
NA,"a decrease of 5,510 acres on the figure for",29
NA,1957-58 and is the smallest area sown since,29
NA,1888.,29
NA,In connexion with the concept of expan-,29
NA,"sion, I am sorry that the Government does",29
NA,"not encourage people, by tax remissions and",29
NA,"other concessions, to go into isolated areas",29
NA,of this great country and by clearing the,29
NA,land and cultivation bring additional land,29
NA,the into production. I refer now particularly,29
NA,"to King Island. This island, roughly 40",29
NA,"miles long and 20 miles wide, is situated",29
NA,be mid-way between Tasmania and Victoria.,29
NA,Residents there have tried repeatedly to,29
NA,"obtain a zonal income tax concession, and",29
NA,"were as early as November, 1951, the former",29
NA,pointed out that concessions,29
NA,section 79A of the act were intro-,29
NA,as a form of practical recognition of,29
NA,disabilities to which residents of the,29
NA,areas concerned are subject because of un-,29
NA,"climatic conditions, isolation and",29
NA,the high cost of living in comparison with,29
NA,as other parts of Australia. These require-,29
NA,"ments are all to be found on King Island,",29
NA,37 yet the Treasurer has again turned down,29
NA,the request.,29
NA,The Department of Primary Industry,29
NA,which administers the war service land,29
NA,"settlement scheme, recognizes the difficul-",29
NA,ties of more than 160 Second World War,29
NA,soldier settlers on King Island from the,29
NA,"viewpoint of their isolation from markets,",29
NA,"high freight costs, the high cost of living",29
NA,comand the need for re-development of most,29
NA,properties. It has set up a committee of,29
NA,inquiry to investigate the financial position,29
NA,of each settler on the island. I regret that,29
NA,Gothe Minister for Primary Industry ( Mr.,29
NA,Adermann) would not agree to the request,29
NA,we from the islanders to set up a joint parlia-,29
NA,mentary committee to inquire into all,29
NA,"aspects of war service land settlement, but",29
NA,I commend him for setting up this commit-,29
NA,tee of inquiry. I assure him of the full,29
NA,prosupport of the settlers in any attempt to,29
NA,stability to the various settle-,29
NA,the ments not only on King Island but,29
NA,"is also at Mawbanna, Montagu and Preolenna.",29
NA,"It is to be hoped that one day, some",29
NA,federal Treasurer will recognize the claims,29
NA,the King Islanders for a zonal tax con-,29
NA,These people are battling against,29
NA,high costs brought about by their isolation,29
NA,and the great depreciation of plant and,30
NA,machinery that occurs there. One has only,30
NA,to see the effect of the salt air on motor,30
NA,"cars, tractors and other farm machinery to",30
NA,"appreciate the difficulties of their position,",30
NA,the fairness of their claims for zonal tax,30
NA,concessions and for further depreciation,30
NA,allowances on farm machinery. However,30
NA,we expand the economy of this country-,30
NA,and we must expand to hold it-i t is vitally,30
NA,important that our natural resources and,30
NA,assets are used to the fullest extent. Full,30
NA,use must be made of the funds and re-,30
NA,sources of the Commonwealth Bank.,30
NA,"Here, I wish to make a plea for the",30
NA,timber industry not only in Tasmania but,30
NA,also in Australia as a whole. Importations,30
NA,of cheap Malayan timber have risen by,30
NA,"25,000,000 super, feet in recent years.",30
NA,The production of Tasmanian timber has,30
NA,"dropped from 151,000,000 super, feet",30
NA,"to 141,000,000 super, feet in four years.",30
NA,This is mainly due to lack of li-in. and,30
NA,2-in. hardwood. In a fiercely competitive,30
NA,"trade, millers find they have not the finan-",30
NA,cial resources to cut these lines of timber,30
NA,because it takes approximately eighteen,30
NA,months for li-in. timber and two years,30
NA,for 2-in. timber to air-dry before being,30
NA,"kiln-dried. Approximately 4,000,000",30
NA,"super, feet is available now, but Tas-",30
NA,"mania could build this total to 10,000,000",30
NA,"super, feet a year and compete success-",30
NA,fully with Malayan imports if some finan-,30
NA,cial backing were given. Millers simply,30
NA,cannot afford to wait while these stocks,30
NA,drying before making sales.,30
NA,The Commonwealth should investigate,30
NA,the possibility of making an advance to,30
NA,"millers of, for example, 80s. for 100 green",30
NA,"super, feet. An amount of Â£400,000",30
NA,"to cover 10,000,000 super, feet could",30
NA,easily come from the Commonwealth Bank,30
NA,and be repaid by the millers when they,30
NA,had disposed of their stocks of the finished,30
NA,product. I make this plea because the,30
NA,timber industry is of great importance,30
NA,Tasmania. This Government has refused,30
NA,to restrict the rapidly increasing imports,30
NA,from Malaya and has over-ridden the,30
NA,commendation of the Tariff Board for,30
NA,freight subsidy for the Tasmanian product.,30
NA,Perhaps the Government will give some,30
NA,consideration to providing financial assisttelevision,30
NA,ance to millers in their attempt to build,30
NA,F.6207/59 -R -[25 ],30
NA,up stocks of l i and 2 inch timber which,30
NA,could successfully compete with imported,30
NA,timber in the joinery trade. I have stated,30
NA,before in this chamber that any assistance,30
NA,to the timber trade would be a good,30
NA,national investment. A cycle of employ-,30
NA,ment is created starting with the loggers,30
NA,and the millers in the bush. The mills go,30
NA,into increased production and that provides,30
NA,"employment for bricklayers, tilers, plumbers,",30
NA,electricians and home furnishers. That,30
NA,cycle influences and affects whole sections,30
NA,"of the community, and any move to create",30
NA,employment in this country should be con-,30
NA,sidered carefully by the Government.,30
NA,Unemployment figures have risen from a,30
NA,"minima of 31,000 in 1956, 46,000 in",30
NA,"1957, and 56,000 in 1958, to a minimum",30
NA,"of 63,000 in any month of this year. The",30
NA,unfortunate unemployed and their depen-,30
NA,dants are the people for whom the Budget,30
NA,should have provided a greater measure,30
NA,of social justice. But they are simply,30
NA,referred to by the Government as a per-,30
NA,"centage of the work force, and the Budget",30
NA,contains no mention of any attempt to,30
NA,solve this problem of growing unemploy-,30
NA,ment. This Government has succeeded in,30
NA,its objective of creating a pool of unem-,30
NA,"ployment and, by denying those out of",30
NA,work any increase in the unemployment,30
NA,"benefit, shows itself to be quite indifferent",30
NA,to this great social problem.,30
NA,"In conclusion, I wish to support the",30
NA,"claims made by my colleague, the honor-",30
NA,"are able member for Wilmot ( Mr Duthie), for",30
NA,the provision of television services to the,30
NA,north-west coast of Tasmania as soon as,30
NA,practicable. In this area we are averaging,30
NA,"40 per cent, reception from Melbourne tele-",30
NA,"vision stations and, since television is here",30
NA,"to stay, people there are keen to avail",30
NA,themselves of this medium of entertain-,30
NA,ment. The Government should investigate,30
NA,the possibility of relaying programmes to,30
NA,"the coast, from Melbourne, by means of a",30
NA,"booster station on King Island, or from",30
NA,to Hobart by a booster station on Mount,30
NA,"Roland, and should make television recep-",30
NA,tion available to the isolated mining com-,30
NA,remunities on the west coast by a booster,30
NA,a station on Mount Sedgewick or some,30
NA,other suitable west coast peak.,30
NA,Retailers are reaping a harvest by selling,30
NA,receivers which will be out of,30
NA,date by the time television comes to the,30
NA,north-west coast in its right and proper,31
NA,fashion. If a station can be set up for,31
NA,"Â£300,000 to Â£400,000, as mentioned in",31
NA,<ne recent debate on the extension of tele-,31
NA,"vision to country areas, I hope it will not",31
NA,be long before the Postmaster-General,31
NA,approves of the extension of television to,31
NA,the areas I have mentioned.,31
Mr ASTON ,Phillip) [12.37] - I have,31
NA,listened with interest to the first speech,31
NA,the honorable member for Braddon ( Mr.,31
NA,"Davies) on a budget, and I must confess",31
NA,"that I was rather disappointed, because he",31
NA,followed the humdrum line that we have,31
NA,had from the Labour Opposition right,31
NA,throughout this debate. We have heard,31
NA,honorable members opposite trying to whip,31
NA,"into life the old, dead story of unem-",31
NA,"ployment. Surely, Mr Temporary Chair-",31
NA,"man, any political party with any political",31
NA,nous knows that unemployment in this,31
NA,"country is a dead issue-know s that, far",31
NA,"from rising, unemployment has fallen.",31
NA,"Indeed, I have very high hopes that it will",31
NA,continue to fall.,31
NA,The honorable member for Braddon,31
NA,talked about this Government having,31
NA,succeeded in creating a pool of unemploy-,31
NA,ment. To rebut that statement I simply,31
NA,refer the honorable gentleman to the Go-,31
NA,vernment's history over the ten years in,31
NA,"which it has been in office, when, at many",31
NA,"times, we have had full employment in",31
NA,Australia.,31
NA,Like many other members of the Labour,31
NA,"Party, the honorable gentleman looks on",31
NA,Budget-time as a time for gathering round,31
NA,"the Christmas tree, with handouts for",31
NA,"everybody, irrespective of where the",31
NA,finance is to come from. We never hear,31
NA,from the Opposition at Budget-time any,31
NA,constructive suggestion for improving the,31
NA,economy or increasing our expansion and,31
NA,productivity. All we have from it this,31
NA,time is criticism about the level of social,31
NA,"service benents, tax rates and postal",31
NA,"charges. At the same time, honorable",31
NA,"members opposite talk about the "" colossal",31
NA,"profits "" made by large manufacturers and",31
NA,retailers. Surely a little simple arithmetic,31
NA,would tell any one that the creation of a,31
NA,condition of full employment relies on the,31
NA,expansion of the activities of our manu-,31
NA,"facturers, so that the working people of",31
NA,"this country, whom the Opposition claims",31
NA,"to represent here, can have the high",31
NA,standards of living that Australians con-,31
NA,sider necessary. I believe that before the,31
NA,public will ever return the Labour Party,31
NA,"to the treasury bench, that party will have",31
NA,to develop a more national outlook-,31
NA,losing its sectional outlook and abandon-,31
NA,ing its attempt to whip up ill-feeling in,31
NA,the community about class distinctions.,31
NA,The days when that kind of thing meant,31
NA,anything have gone. The people are sick,31
NA,by of it. They have had good government,31
NA,"over the last ten years, and I suggest to",31
NA,honorable gentlemen opposite that at least,31
NA,they should develop a more national out-,31
NA,look for the benefit of this country.,31
NA,"With those few remarks, Mr Temporary",31
NA,"Chairman, I turn now to matters which",31
NA,I believe are important in relation to the,31
NA,Budget. During the Budget speech the,31
NA,Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) quite properly,31
NA,referred in commendatory terms to the,31
NA,expansion and increased productivity that,31
NA,had taken place in Australia over the last,31
NA,ten years. He rightly took pride in the,31
NA,"record of the Government which, as a result",31
NA,"of its sound, progressive policy, has main-",31
NA,tained the Australian economy in a most,31
NA,sound and extremely stable position.,31
NA,I was particularly pleased to learn that,31
NA,the Budget provides for increases of age,31
NA,and invalid pensions and repatriation bene-,31
NA,"fits. I point out, however, that these in-",31
NA,"creases, at this particular time, are no",31
NA,more than could reasonably be given by,31
NA,the Government. Particularly do I say so,31
NA,because I feel that there are real prospects,31
NA,of further increases in the prices of con-,31
NA,sumer goods in the ensuing year.,31
NA,Whilst the proposed increases of pen-,31
NA,sions and repatriation benefits are accept-,31
NA,"able, I should prefer to see them coupled",31
NA,with a relaxation of the means test. I,31
NA,share the views of the honorable member,31
NA,for Sturt ( Mr Wilson) on this matter. The,31
NA,means test does not encourage thrift. In,31
NA,"fact, it penalizes those who have taken",31
NA,pains in their early life to save up for their,31
NA,old age. With the proposed increases in,31
NA,the rates of pensions people on super-,31
NA,"annuation, or who come within the ambit",31
NA,"of the means test, will be further pena-",31
NA,lized. Many of them have put their,31
NA,savings into bonds and superannuation,31
NA,"schemes, and have made a contribution to",31
NA,the comforts that they will enjoy-o r hope,31
NA,to enjoy-i n the later stages of their lives.,32
NA,Under the Budget proposals a married,32
NA,couple will be able to receive an income,32
NA,"of Â£16 10s. a week, made up of their pen-",32
NA,sions and any outside income they may,32
NA,"gain, without affecting their pensions. That",32
NA,is more than Â£3 above the basic wage.,32
NA,"There are many people who, because of",32
NA,"their thrift, are not receiving this amount",32
NA,into their homes to-day. The return from,32
NA,their investments and the superannuation,32
NA,"benefits for which they have contributed,",32
NA,together do not give them such an income.,32
NA,"Consequently, those people are becoming",32
NA,the new poor of Australia. I urgently sug-,32
NA,gest to the Government that it give con-,32
NA,sideration to a further alleviation of the,32
NA,"means test so as to embrace these people,",32
NA,who at present are being penalized because,32
NA,of their past thrift.,32
NA,"Thrift, of course, should be encouraged,",32
NA,not discouraged. As a result of the con-,32
NA,tinued application of the means test people,32
NA,"who might otherwise save to support, or",32
NA,"help to support, themselves in their old",32
NA,"age, will squander their savings so that",32
NA,they will be eligible to receive pensions.,32
NA,Most honorable members have experiences,32
NA,of people telling them of their financial,32
NA,position and wanting to know how far they,32
NA,must bring their assets down in order to,32
NA,receive a pension without being affected,32
NA,"by the means test. I believe, Sir, that this",32
NA,position should be avoided. I realize that,32
NA,wherever we draw the line in relation to,32
NA,the means test there will always be some-,32
NA,body above it and somebody else below it.,32
NA,"At the same time, however, when we con-",32
NA,sider that a pensioner couple may have an,32
NA,"income of Â£16 10s. a week, without their",32
NA,"pensions being affected, and without their",32
NA,"having had to save a penny towards it, we",32
NA,can see that people who did save for the,32
NA,future are being penalized.,32
NA,Another matter touching social services,32
NA,to which I wish to refer is the funeral,32
NA,benefit. I believe that the funeral benefit,32
NA,has not been increased since 1943. It still,32
NA,stands at the princely sum of Â£10. Every-,32
NA,body knows of the increases in costs that,32
NA,"have occurred since 1943, particularly",32
NA,"funeral costs, which seem to have risen",32
NA,to an exorbitant degree. In most cases it,32
NA,is the relatives of a deceased age pen-,32
NA,sioner who have either to pay for the,32
NA,"funeral in full or contribute to its cost,",32
NA,although many aged pensioners do manage,32
NA,to scrape from their pensions a few shillings,32
NA,"each week, which are put aside to help",32
NA,them to keep their pride by knowing that,32
NA,they will have a decent burial. I submit,32
NA,that Â£10 as a funeral benefit is grossly in-,32
NA,"adequate at this time, and the Government",32
NA,should look at this with a view to increas-,32
NA,ing it to an amount more in keeping with,32
NA,actual funeral costs to-day.,32
NA,Sitting suspended from 12.45-to 2.35 p.m.,32
Mr ASTON ,Prio r to the suspension,32
NA,of the sitting I made a plea to the Govern-,32
NA,ment to make some modification in the,32
NA,means test and also to increase funeral,32
NA,benefits. The cost to the community of,32
NA,"social services must inevitably increase,",32
NA,but at the same time I believe that the,32
NA,majority of Australians will accept that,32
NA,cost if it means that the aged and the,32
NA,sick in the community will enjoy a better,32
NA,"standard of living, provided, of course,",32
NA,that social services are based on needs.,32
NA,I was extremely disappointed that the,32
NA,"Budget, except for a liberalization of the",32
NA,"retention allowance for private companies,",32
NA,did not give any incentives for the expan-,32
NA,sion of the private sector of the economy.,32
NA,It may be argued that public works in,32
NA,themselves add to the expansion and are an,32
NA,"encouragement to the private sector, but",32
NA,I believe that the private sector of the,32
NA,economy deserves some other incentives.,32
NA,The Treasurer in his Budget speech re-,32
NA,peatedly acknowledged the part played by,32
NA,industry and on several other occasions he,32
NA,has emphasized the role of industry in the,32
NA,past ten years. He posed the question:,32
NA,Can this development be equalled or sur-,32
NA,passed in the next decade? I believe that,32
NA,"the answer is "" Yes""; but I also believe",32
NA,that encouragement for industry to achieve,32
NA,still higher production and efficiency and,32
NA,to reduce costs of production must be,32
NA,"given, and not given too late.",32
NA,In recent years our work force has in-,32
NA,creased considerably. In the last four,32
NA,years it has increased by approximately,32
NA,"60,000 persons a year and now numbers",32
NA,"approximately 4,000,000 people. By 1970",32
NA,it is anticipated that the work force will,32
NA,"total 5,300,000 people, or an increase of",32
NA,"1,300,000 people in ten years. This is a",32
NA,"rate of 2.6 per cent, per annuni compared",33
NA,"with 1.6 per cent, in recent years. It is",33
NA,"estimated that in 1960 104,000 additional",33
NA,workers will be available for employment.,33
NA,Opportunities for employment must be,33
NA,available immediately if we are to main-,33
NA,tain or improve our low unemployment,33
NA,"percentage and our standard of living, and",33
NA,to increase our productivity level. The,33
NA,manufacturing industries will be called,33
NA,"upon to absorb approximately 40,000 of",33
NA,the additional work force. It is well to,33
NA,note that the yearly absorption rate over,33
NA,the last two years has been approximately,33
NA,"16,000 people. It is obvious therefore that",33
NA,employment will have to be found for,33
NA,approximately two and one half times the,33
NA,number now absorbed yearly.,33
NA,Those figures show quite starkly the,33
NA,magnitude of the problem ahead and repre-,33
NA,sent a challenge that must be faced by,33
NA,industry. One cannot fail to conclude that,33
NA,unless these additional persons are readily,33
NA,"absorbed into employment, our internal",33
NA,economy may require some unpleasant,33
NA,adjustments.,33
NA,"In addition to these responsibilities, in-",33
NA,dustry and commerce must play a leading,33
NA,role in fulfilling our much needed export,33
NA,requirements. The Export Development,33
NA,Council has reached tbe conclusion that if,33
NA,we are to avoid continual balance of pay-,33
NA,ments problems we must extend our income,33
NA,"from trading overseas by Â£250,000,000",33
NA,"within the next five years, or at the rate",33
NA,"of Â£50,000,000 a year. The report of the",33
NA,Export Development Council states-,33
NA,"Prospects in traditional markets, particularly",33
NA,"for agricultural foodstuffs, were not encouraging",33
NA,although exports of basic raw materials would,33
NA,improve if economic growth was maintained,33
NA,abroad. . . .,33
NA,To earn the export income needed to support,33
NA,"economic development, ever increasing attention",33
NA,must be devoted to manufactured and semi-,33
NA,manufactured products.,33
NA,The council points out that although,33
NA,spects for wool exports are somewhat enit,33
NA,couraging-thi s has proved to be correct-,33
NA,there is less optimism for wheat exports,33
NA,the next five years.,33
NA,The council believes that the chief possioverall,33
NA,bilities for growth in overseas sales lie,33
NA,"iron and steel products, motor vehicles,",33
NA,"agricultural machinery and parts, engineertaxes",33
NA,"ing products, tools, hardware and",33
NA,products. Those articles at present are,33
NA,supplied and manufactured by secondary,33
NA,industries. It can be seen clearly then that,33
NA,industry is urgently in need of encourage-,33
NA,ment if it is to gear itself to the task ahead.,33
NA,"The building of great factories, the carrying",33
NA,"out of more scientific experiments, and the",33
NA,improving of efficiency depend very greatly,33
NA,on the ability of industry to meet the chal-,33
NA,"lenge of absorption, productivity and in-",33
NA,"creased sales abroad, all of which are vital",33
NA,to our economy.,33
NA,A great deal has been done to advertise,33
NA,Australian goods in overseas markets. But,33
NA,much more must be done in this field to,33
NA,secure the necessary expansion and provide,33
NA,the incentive to sell or market overseas.,33
NA,Our commercial undertakings and manu-,33
NA,facturing industries must become conscious,33
NA,of the advantages of trading with Asian and,33
NA,"other countries. Australia is a young, pro-",33
NA,gressive and expanding country. We enjoy,33
NA,the confidence of the free world. We,33
NA,"should not be afraid of incipient inflation,",33
NA,however much we may dislike the idea of,33
NA,"inflation, because a young country expand-",33
NA,ing as rapidly as Australia has been expand-,33
NA,ing in the past can hardly avoid some,33
NA,measure of inflation if it is to go forward.,33
NA,A too cautious attitude could have severe,33
NA,limiting effects on the rate of our expansion,33
NA,and development. If we are to avoid being,33
NA,priced out of overseas markets and if we,33
NA,are to reduce the cost of living on the con-,33
NA,"sumer market in Australia, costs of manu-",33
NA,facture must be kept to a minimum.,33
NA,It may be pointed out that undoubtedly,33
NA,the proposed increase in telephone and,33
NA,postal charges will be borne in the main by,33
NA,"industry. Those increases, together with",33
NA,"the recent basic wage increase, must have a",33
NA,substantial and unavoidable effect on costs,33
NA,in Australia. Industry generally will not,33
NA,"be content to bear those costs and, as a",33
NA,"consequence, will pass them on to the con-",33
NA,prosumer. I suggest to the Government that,33
NA,may see fit to examine the range of taxes,33
NA,"that add to inflation-taxe s which, when",33
NA,in trade and industry are playing and will,33
NA,continue to play an increasing part in our,33
NA,"economy, inflate the prices at which",33
NA,in we are required to sell overseas or on the,33
NA,consumer market. Such taxes are retarding,33
NA,and should be either progressively,33
NA,similar reduced or abolished altogether.,33
NA,This brings me to the point that the,34
NA,Government should have considered some,34
NA,"measure of relief in pay-roll tax, either in",34
NA,"the form of reduction in the rate of the tax,",34
NA,"an increase in the deductible allowance, or,",34
NA,"less probable, its total abolition. To my",34
NA,mind that would have had the effect of,34
NA,reminding industry that the Government,34
NA,had not entirely forgotten it and was con-,34
NA,cerned with the magnitude of the task that,34
NA,lies ahead. I do not want it to be thought,34
NA,that I believe that industry is not doing,34
NA,"well at present. In fact, industry and com-",34
NA,merce have improved their positions in,34
NA,recent years and have made good profits,34
NA,and achieved good trading results. I think,34
NA,any fair-minded person will agree that had,34
NA,it not been for the fact that industry and,34
NA,commerce have been able to progress and,34
NA,"make profits, our economy would not be in",34
NA,its present healthy state.,34
NA,Relief from the pay-roll tax would,34
NA,"stimulate the development, expansion and",34
NA,"progress of industry, and it would encourage",34
NA,the inflow of capital investment which is,34
NA,imperative if we are to get the new build-,34
NA,ings and capital equipment which are so,34
NA,necessary for the expansion of our eco-,34
NA,nomy. If the Government had taken any,34
NA,"of the courses that I have suggested, it",34
NA,would have added to the capacity to reduce,34
NA,the prime cost of goods to the manufacturer,34
NA,and to reduce the sale price to the distri-,34
NA,"butor or retailer, whose profits would be",34
NA,"struck at the lower cost level. This, in",34
NA,"turn, would result in the capacity to sell",34
NA,our commodities to the community at,34
NA,"generally lower prices and, at the same",34
NA,"time, would strengthen our trade with other",34
NA,countries by making our prices more com-,34
NA,petitive in the world's markets.,34
NA,"The pay-roll tax, Sir, was introduced in",34
NA,"1941, and it is estimated that, in the current cluding",34
NA,"financial year, it will return some",34
NA,"Â£53,000,000 to revenue. As I shall show,",34
NA,the burden of this tax is placed mainly on,34
NA,industry and the manufacturer. The pay-,34
NA,roll tax has quite frequently been related to,34
NA,the financing of child endowment. It has,34
NA,been said that child endowment is part of,34
NA,"the wage structure and, therefore, a logical",34
NA,addition to the costs of the employer. The,34
NA,"basic wage, however, is now fixed on the",34
NA,basis of the capacity of industry to pay and,34
NA,on the needs of the family wage-earner.,34
NA,and therefore the employer virtually con^,34
NA,"tributes twice, owing to the increased wages",34
NA,resulting from the method of fixing the,34
NA,"basic wage, and owing to the imposition",34
NA,of this iniquitous tax. As the basic wage,34
NA,takes into consideration the needs of the,34
NA,"family man, child endowment becomes a",34
NA,straight-out social service obligation. I do,34
NA,not support the contention that any parti-,34
NA,cular section of the community should be,34
NA,called upon to finance any particular part,34
NA,of social service benefits. Social services,34
NA,should be the responsibility of the whole,34
NA,"community, and child endowment should",34
NA,not be regarded differently from any other,34
NA,social service benefit such as age pensions,34
NA,or medical benefits.,34
NA,All State governments and local,34
NA,"authorities pay this tax, which, in turn,",34
NA,increases the costs of State railways and,34
NA,"public transport, with consequent increases",34
NA,in fares and freight rates. This further adds,34
NA,to the costs of industry and consumers. It is,34
NA,interesting to analyse the break-up of the,34
NA,sources of pay-roll tax. State government,34
NA,instrumentalities and State government de-,34
NA,partments and local government authorities,34
NA,"contribute between them Â£15,000,000 a",34
NA,"year. Manufacturing, building and con-",34
NA,"struction industries contribute Â£25,000,000.",34
NA,Distributing wholesalers and retailers con-,34
NA,"tribute Â£4,000,000 each. Primary produc-",34
NA,"tion, including mining, contributes",34
NA,"Â£3,000,000, and all others not shown in",34
NA,the preceding categories contribute,34
NA,"Â£2,000,000. This gives a total pay-roll tax",34
NA,"yield of Â£53,000,000. It can readily be",34
NA,"seen that the manufacturing, building and",34
NA,construction employers pay almost one-half,34
NA,"of the tax, and that commerce, in the form",34
NA,"of wholesalers and retailers, pays",34
NA,"Â£8,000,000, whereas primary industry, in-",34
NA,"mining, contributes only",34
NA,"Â£3,000,000. The burdensome tax has an",34
NA,"undoubted inflationary effect, and its sec-",34
NA,tional application can readily be seen by,34
NA,reference to the figures which I have just,34
NA,given.,34
NA,"If the pay-roll tax were to be abolished,",34
NA,the net loss to revenue would not necessarily -,34
NA,"total Â£53,000,000, for the loss could be",34
NA,offset in a number of ways. Grants to the,34
NA,States could be reduced by the amount of,34
NA,pay-roll tax that the State governments are,34
NA,"now called upon to pay-Â£15,000,00 0 a",34
NA,year. The yield of company tax and tax,35
NA,on income derived from companies would,35
NA,be increased. As pay-roll tax payments,35
NA,are deductible from gross figures before the,35
NA,"profit or loss is struck, it is estimated",35
NA,the abolition of the tax would result in,35
NA,"additional revenue of Â£13,000,000 from",35
NA,this source. It can be seen that these two,35
NA,factors alone would increase the Govern-,35
NA,"ment's revenue by Â£28,000,000. If we",35
NA,add to this the savings that the Govern-,35
NA,ment would make in lower costs for goods,35
NA,"and services, together with the saving of",35
NA,expenditure resulting from the necessary,35
NA,"readjustment of the staff policing the tax,",35
NA,we could conservatively take the total gain,35
NA,"to Â£30,000,000. This would leave a loss",35
NA,"to revenue of only Â£23,000,000 from the",35
NA,total abolition of the pay-roll tax.,35
NA,As it is estimated that the returns from,35
NA,income tax will be reduced by more than,35
NA,"Â£22,000,000 as a result of the tax con-",35
NA,"cessions in this Budget, the pay-roll tax",35
NA,could well have been abolished and the,35
NA,benefit spread over the whole community.,35
NA,This would have made a real contribution,35
NA,towards stability by removing an inflation-,35
NA,ary medium from our economic structure.,35
NA,The abolition of this tax would have made,35
NA,the prices of our exports more highly com-,35
NA,"petitive with those of overseas products,",35
NA,and home-consumption prices would have,35
NA,been reduced. The private investment of,35
NA,capital would have been given a fillip which,35
NA,industry will most certainly need if it is to,35
NA,undertake the task of expansion ahead.,35
NA,"Therefore, I ask the Government to con-",35
NA,"sider the abolition, or, alternatively, the",35
NA,"reduction, of this iniquitous tax. It is dis-",35
NA,"criminatory and sectional, and it is imposed",35
NA,only on the employer of labour. It does,35
NA,not apply to other kinds of business people,35
NA,whose businesses may be equally as profit-,35
NA,"able, or even more profitable-fo r example,",35
NA,"farmers and graziers, who qualify for",35
NA,exemption.,35
NA,This tax penalizes the employer for effi-,35
NA,ciency and for increasing his staff. The,35
NA,"more workers he employs, the more tax",35
NA,"he is called upon to pay. In fact, he is",35
NA,penalized for increasing the work force-,35
NA,the very thing for which incentive should,35
NA,be given. Pay-roll tax must be paid by the,35
NA,the employer regardless of whether his,35
NA,operations show a profit or a loss. In,35
NA,"respect, to my mind, this tax disregards",35
NA,basic principle of taxation-tha t a tax must,35
NA,be based on the amount of income earned,35
NA,"and the ability to pay. As I have shown,",35
NA,this tax is inflationary. It is a cumulative,35
NA,"that tax, and the greater the number of pro-",35
NA,"cesses in the manufacture of an article, the",35
NA,greater is the proportion of cost added by,35
NA,"the pay-roll tax. The result, Sir, is that,",35
NA,"ultimately, the additional cost to the con-",35
NA,sumer is more than the revenue derived,35
NA,by the Government. Industry needs in-,35
NA,"centive to expand, and I have endeavoured",35
NA,to show that unless it is encouraged and,35
NA,assisted to absorb the increasing work force,35
NA,we shall be in for some unpleasant adjust-,35
NA,ments in our economy.,35
NA,The pay-roll tax is not the only tax to,35
NA,which I think the Government should turn,35
NA,"its attention. The sales tax, also, should",35
NA,be given close attention by the Govern-,35
NA,ment. The family man with the larger,35
NA,family is the one who is called upon to pay,35
NA,"most, and the larger the family, the more",35
NA,"he pays, particularly in sales tax on food-",35
NA,"stuffs and necessities such as pepper,",35
NA,"essences, soap and soap powders and other",35
NA,"essential requirements such as toothpaste,",35
NA,"boot polish and, of course, household fur-",35
NA,"niture, which is so necessary to newly-",35
NA,married couples. These are things to which,35
NA,the Government should look if it is so,35
NA,much concerned about keeping down the,35
NA,cost of living. It should reduce direcdy,35
NA,the costs of those who use these things,35
NA,most and who are now called upon to pay,35
NA,most in sales tax- a tax which further adds,35
NA,to consumer costs.,35
NA,There are many anomalies in the sales,35
NA,"tax legislation, and I should like to direct",35
NA,the Government's attention to one or two,35
NA,"which I think should be rectified. We find,",35
NA,"for instance, that biscuits for human con-",35
NA,sumption are taxed at the rate of 12i per,35
NA,cent. Yet dog biscuits are entirely exempt.,35
NA,"We find also that meat pies are exempt,",35
NA,although fish or fruit pies attract a rate of,35
NA,\ 2 i per cent. The Government should,35
NA,give consideration to the numerous,35
NA,anomalies that exist. I have mentioned,35
NA,"those few only, because my time is limited.",35
NA,I now wish to turn to a discussion of,35
NA,Postmaster-General's Department.,35
NA,Although the charges that it is proposed,35
NA,this to increase have not been increased since,35
NA,"a 1951, it is agreed on all sides that wages",35
NA,and other costs have increased enormously.,36
NA,The question that is exercising my mind is,36
NA,this: If these costs have been increasing,36
NA,"since 1951, why were the increases in",36
NA,charges delayed for so long? If they had,36
NA,"been made earlier, or if the charges had",36
NA,"been increased progressively, they would",36
NA,not then have made such an impact upon,36
NA,the community or have been so unpopular.,36
NA,The process of increasing these charges,36
NA,should have been a more gradual one. I,36
NA,"do suggest, however, that no Government",36
NA,worth its salt would hesitate to introduce,36
NA,unpopular measures such as this one if it,36
NA,were found necessary to do so in order,36
NA,to put this great organization on a business-,36
NA,"like footing, as I believe it should be.",36
NA,A committee has been set up to inquire,36
NA,into tbe capital employed in the Postmaster-,36
NA,General's Department. This is a formid-,36
NA,"able task, and I believe the committee's",36
NA,"terms of reference should be widened, and",36
NA,that a full and searching inquiry should be,36
NA,made into the methods and the efficiency,36
NA,"of the department, and into any wastage",36
NA,that occurs. We have magnificent,36
NA,organizations such as Qantas Empire Air-,36
NA,"ways Limited, Trans-Australia Airlines,",36
NA,"and the national shipping line, which",36
NA,"operate at a profit, are efficient and com-",36
NA,pete with private interests on a competi-,36
NA,tive basis. We know that the Post Office,36
NA,is on a different footing from those organi-,36
NA,"zations, but I think the committee I have",36
NA,mentioned should inquire into the question,36
NA,whether all or part of the Post Office,36
NA,organization should be placed under the,36
NA,control of a commission. We know that,36
NA,"in time of war, and also, of course, in",36
NA,"peace-time, lines of communication have",36
NA,to be kept open. We know that capital,36
NA,equipment is essential and that probably,36
NA,the running of the Postmaster-General's,36
NA,Department is beyond the scope of private,36
NA,"interests. But as matters stand to-day, we",36
NA,find that the general taxpayer is contribut-,36
NA,ing towards the maintenance of the postal,36
NA,services through general revenue.,36
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The honorParliament,36
NA,able gentleman's time has expired.,36
Mr MINOGUE ,West Sydney) [2.57] -,36
NA,We are discussing to-day a budget proCommonwealth,36
NA,viding for revenue and expenditure of,36
NA,"than Â£1,600,000,000. Although we have",36
NA,listened to many members of the,36
NA,and Country Parties telling us of the good,36
NA,"things the Budget contains, the amendment",36
NA,of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt),36
NA,will be put to the vote to-night before half,36
NA,of the 123 members of this House have,36
NA,bothered to speak in tlie debate. The,36
NA,reason why they have not spoken is simply,36
NA,that they are ashamed of the things that,36
NA,the Budget contains. There is no other,36
NA,reason.,36
NA,"The previous speaker, the honorable",36
NA,"member for Phillip ( Mr Aston), opened",36
NA,his speech by saying that there are not many,36
NA,unemployed in this country. He said there,36
NA,"are only a few thousand of them and that,",36
NA,"after all, the proportion is less than in any",36
NA,other country. The first part of my speech,36
NA,to-day will be devoted to the unemploy-,36
NA,ment problem. The Minister for Labour,36
NA,and National Service ( Mr MCMahon) has,36
NA,"told us that there are up to 70,000 people",36
NA,out of work. I venture to suggest that the,36
NA,incidence of unemployment is greater in my,36
NA,electorate in Sydney than anywhere else in,36
NA,Australia. Yet we find that a member of,36
NA,this Parliament whose electorate is only a,36
NA,few miles from mine and includes within,36
NA,"its boundaries not one factory or industry, a",36
NA,member who won his seat from a Labour,36
NA,man by taking advantage of the publicity,36
NA,"associated with the Petrov case, gets up in",36
NA,this committee and tells us that it does not,36
NA,matter very much about these people who,36
NA,are out of work.,36
NA,"I challenge that honorable member, and",36
NA,I challenge the Minister for Labour and,36
NA,"National Service, to find jobs for the hun-",36
NA,dreds of people who are out of work in,36
NA,my electorate. Every day they come to,36
NA,me and I send them to the Commonwealth,36
NA,"Employment Service in the Grace Building,",36
NA,and they are all told the same thing. In,36
NA,fact it seems to be a crime for a man or,36
NA,"woman to be over 50 years of age, because",36
NA,they then have no earthly chance of getting,36
NA,jobs. Yet we hear the Minister for Social,36
NA,Services ( Mr Roberton) telling us in this,36
NA,that besides the Â£4 7s. 6d. age,36
NA,"pension, a person is also allowed to earn",36
NA,Â£3 10s. a week. Let me tell the Minister,36
NA,"that 86 per cent, of pensioners in the",36
NA,do not earn anything at all.,36
NA,"more Nevertheless, he continues to tell the",36
NA,people that a pensioner's income can be as,36
NA,Liberal high as Â£8 5s. a week.,36
NA,Everything that this Government gives,37
NA,to pensioners has a string tied to it. In,37
NA,"1955 it gave them a small increase, and",37
NA,what did we find? We found that a pen-,37
NA,sioner who earned more than Â£2 a week,37
NA,was deprived of the benefits of the pen-,37
NA,sioner medical service. Is that not a trick?,37
NA,"Of course it is a trick to say to these people,",37
NA,""" You may earn a couple of pounds a week,",37
NA,but you will then lose your entitlement to,37
NA,"the pensioner medical service, your right to",37
NA,"concession travel in trains, and various",37
NA,"other concessions"". This Government",37
NA,always makes sure that it can pull a string,37
NA,and take back some of the increase that,37
NA,it gives.,37
NA,"In Sydney, there are men and women",37
NA,trudging the streets looking for jobs.,37
NA,they register for employment they are,37
NA,"asked how old they are, and if a male",37
NA,applicant is more than 65 and a woman,37
NA,"more than 60, they are told that the best",37
NA,thing they can do is to collect the pension.,37
NA,But the pension is not so easily collected.,37
NA,When a person makes application for the,37
NA,pension he is very lucky if he starts to,37
NA,receive it within eight or nine weeks.,37
NA,Is it not degrading for a man who,37
NA,"been used to work, who has regularly Australians.",37
NA,"earned his Â£15 or Â£20 a week, to be",37
NA,reduced to an income of Â£3 or Â£3 5s. a,37
NA,"week, with no hope of anything better",37
NA,during the last ten or fifteen years of,37
NA,life? Yet we hear this Government boastthe,37
NA,ing of the national income at the present,37
NA,time and what it is going to be in the,37
NA,future. It does nothing whatever for,37
NA,people who pioneered this country. Instead,37
NA,of financing the Snowy Mountains scheme,37
NA,"from revenue, the Government should do",37
NA,what would be done by a Labour governtwo,37
NA,"ment, pay for it out of loan moneys.",37
NA,would then have enough money to find,37
NA,work for these old people and to find,37
NA,homes for the people of our community.,37
NA,"Being a rational sort of a bloke, I",37
NA,hopes that something good would come,37
NA,out of the Budget. About this time of,37
NA,the year every one in the Commonwealth,37
NA,is looking to the Budget. The taxpayer,37
NA,is looking for reduced taxation rates.,37
NA,pensioner is looking for a rise in pensions.,37
NA,Every one has his eye on the Budget.,37
NA,after reading the Budget papers and,37
NA,ing the speeches made by honorable mem-,37
NA,"- bers opposite, I cannot be convinced that",37
NA,there is anything good in this Budget for,37
NA,anybody.,37
NA,Let me turn now to the subject of immi-,37
NA,"gration. In 1949, when this Government",37
NA,"came to office, there was an immigration",37
NA,programme in operation. The Prime Minis-,37
NA,ter ( Mr Menzies) promised at that time,37
NA,that immigrants coming to Australia would,37
NA,"be provided with homes, but his promise",37
NA,turned out to be nothing but hypocrisy,37
NA,and sham. He brought out a few hundred,37
NA,homes from Denmark or some other,37
NA,country and scattered them around,37
NA,Queensland and other places. Then it,37
NA,became the responsibility of the States to,37
NA,find homes for these people who were,37
NA,"When dumped here, 120,000 of them each year.",37
NA,"These immigrants arrive in Australia, are",37
NA,placed in hostels and have a terrible time,37
NA,of it when they first come to the country.,37
NA,What is the use of bringing them here if,37
NA,there are no homes for them and no work?,37
NA,They eat their heads off in hostels and,37
NA,nobody is happy about it. They have to,37
NA,leave their families in the hostels until they,37
NA,are able to find some work. This Govern-,37
NA,ment has done nothing to house those,37
NA,has immigrants or to house our native,37
NA,No one looking for a home in this coun-,37
NA,try can expect any help from this Govern-,37
NA,his ment. Look at the raw deal it is giving,37
NA,returned servicemen. These men come,37
NA,to me at my office in Sydney seeking details,37
NA,of the Â£2.750 that they are entitled to get,37
NA,the from the War Service Homes Division.,37
NA,They want to know how long it will be,37
NA,"before they will get a loan, but all I can",37
NA,say is that it will be eighteen months or,37
NA,years. Young men and women who,37
NA,It are eager to get married and settle down,37
NA,find that it is very easy for them to get,37
NA,the money from some other sources while,37
NA,they are waiting on a war service homes,37
NA,loan. The Commonwealth guarantees that,37
NA,"had the advance will eventually be made, so",37
NA,"the money lender, solicitor, or whoever",37
NA,"lends the money, knows that he has only",37
NA,to wait for eighteen months or two years,37
NA,for repayment. But what does the ex-,37
NA,The serviceman pay for this temporary finan-,37
NA,cial accommodation? He must pay nearly,37
NA,"But, 20 per cent, on the Â£2,750 for eighteen",37
NA,hearmonths or two years; there is no other,37
NA,way out. It would be far better for the,38
NA,Government to stop accepting applications,38
NA,until those who have been promised an,38
NA,advance receive it. These young people,38
NA,then would not be tied to a money lender,38
NA,for the mortgage that they need to buy a,38
NA,house. They pay as much in eighteen,38
NA,months or two years to the money lender,38
NA,as they would pay to the Government if,38
NA,they had the advance for the term of their,38
NA,natural life. It is not right that men who,38
NA,have served their country so well should,38
NA,be treated in this way by the Government.,38
NA,But another matter that is even worse,38
NA,than this is the availability of hospital,38
NA,treatment for ex-servicemen. In New South,38
NA,"Wales, this is handled in a most disgrace-",38
NA,ful way. One case I had was that of a,38
NA,"blind man. Although he was 99 per cent,",38
NA,"blind, he had to wait until he was com-",38
NA,pletely blind before he was given a pen-,38
NA,"sion. During the war, a mortar bomb ex-",38
NA,ploded near him and immediately deprived,38
NA,him of the sight of his right eye. But he,38
NA,had to get three or four men who were,38
NA,near him at the time to prove his case,38
NA,when he asked for a pension. Then the,38
NA,sight of his other eye started to go and he,38
NA,could not work. His wife did the best she,38
NA,could to look after him. All these details,38
NA,can be checked; I have brought this matter,38
NA,before honorable members on other occa-,38
NA,sions. Four Macquarie-street specialists,38
NA,said that the loss of sight in the second,38
NA,eye could be caused by the explosion of,38
NA,the mortar bomb; yet the medical referee,38
NA,ruled him out and would not give him a,38
NA,pension.,38
NA,Mr Anderson - I do not believe it!,38
Mr MINOGUE ,Yo u would not,38
NA,believe it. But you will come to believe,38
NA,it one day.,38
NA,Mr Anderson -Wha t about,38
NA,country,38
Mr MINOGUE , I will deal with you,38
NA,later.,38
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The honoranother,38
NA,able member for West Sydney will address,38
NA,the Chair. I ask honorable members to,38
NA,cease interjecting.,38
Mr MINOGUE , I shall mention a case,38
NA,now that I have mentioned in this chamber,38
NA,"before. It concerns a returned soldier, now",38
NA,"living in Sydney, who was shot at Gallipoli.",38
NA,"I know that that is going back a long way,",38
NA,but nevertheless this man was shot in the,38
NA,leg and lost the use of his ankle. Twelve,38
NA,operations were performed on him in,38
NA,"Gallipoli, one in England, one on the way",38
NA,"back to Australia, and several in Sydney.",38
NA,Although he was suffering from this dis-,38
NA,"ability, he continued to work for a tobacco",38
NA,company at Kensington. He had a stick,38
NA,and used to drag his leg along behind him.,38
NA,He received a pension of something like,38
NA,Â£2. Later in life he married. During the,38
NA,Austraha Day holiday in January of this,38
NA,"year, he became very ill and I was called",38
NA,in to see him. I could not get him into,38
NA,any hospital in Sydney. I rang the Yaralla,38
NA,Repatriation Hospital and the Randwick,38
NA,Hospital. I rang every hospital in Sydney.,38
NA,Honorable members will believe me on this,38
NA,"case, as well as on the other one, because",38
NA,I have substantial proof of both cases.,38
NA,There was not a hospital in Sydney that I,38
NA,did not ring about this man. He had some,38
NA,"heart trouble, but it was ruled that this",38
NA,had nothing to do with the war or with,38
NA,his injuries. Surely he had the heart of a,38
NA,"lion, to live at all and to work for the years",38
NA,that he did; but this Government ignored,38
NA,"him all the time. If his ankle was bad,",38
NA,"Yaralla willingly gave him treatment, but",38
NA,"if he suffered any other physical disability,",38
NA,he had to fend for himself.,38
NA,"Following a heart attack, his wife was",38
NA,lucky enough to get him into a hospital at,38
NA,"Glebe at Â£20 a week. However, after three",38
NA,weeks the hospital authorities said that he,38
NA,was not likely to get better and asked his,38
NA,wife to take him away. Arrangements,38
NA,were made for him to go to a hospi-,38
NA,tal at Balmain. His wife arranged for an,38
NA,"ambulance to take him to Balmain, but he",38
NA,was there for only two and a half hours,38
NA,the before the authorities at this hospital tele-,38
NA,phoned her at her home and asked her to,38
NA,take him away because he would not get,38
NA,better and they could not keep him.,38
NA,"Another ambulance was engaged, and",38
NA,fee paid. The man was taken from,38
NA,the Balmain hospital to his home and he,38
NA,was lying on the floor of this little two-,38
NA,storey house when I was called in. During,38
NA,the whole of the Australia Day holiday I,38
NA,"tried to get him into a hospital, but without",38
NA,success. At last I got him into the Sacred,38
NA,Heart Hospice for the Dying at Darling-,39
NA,hurst. That man lived for only five more,39
NA,days.,39
NA,Many honorable members on the Go-,39
NA,vernment side of the House claim that,39
NA,they are ex-servicemen. I put to them,39
NA,that' it is only fair for this Government,39
NA,to do the right thing by these men who,39
NA,gave the best years of their lives in the,39
NA,defence of their country. There cannot,39
NA,be many of them left now. Although four,39
NA,or five specialists may say that a condition,39
NA,"is due to war service, a medical referee",39
NA,"will rule, on behalf of the Government,",39
NA,that the ex-serviceman is not entitled to a,39
NA,pension. The ex-servicemen are not given,39
NA,any consideration at all. I hope that the,39
NA,Minister for Repatriation (Senator Sir,39
NA,Walter Cooper) will do something in the,39
NA,cases that I have mentioned. The Govern-,39
NA,ment does not see fit to look after these,39
NA,"men, but they were good enough to fight",39
NA,in the war. The irony of it all is that,39
NA,the widow of the ex-serviceman to whom,39
NA,I have just referred is only 59 years of,39
NA,age and cannot get the age pension. She,39
NA,"is in receipt of the widow's pension, the",39
NA,lowest pension available. Her two brothers,39
NA,were killed instantly at Gallipoli at the,39
NA,same time as her husband was injured.,39
NA,"For all those years, he dragged along trying",39
NA,"to earn a living; yet this Government,",39
NA,"which says that it tries to help the people,",39
NA,closes its eyes and imposes a means test,39
NA,on those who seek hospital attention. I,39
NA,hope that something will be done to change,39
NA,this position.,39
NA,I turn now to social service payments.,39
NA,Honorable members on the opposite side,39
NA,admit that the pension increase of 7s. 6d.,39
NA,is not very good. But the Treasurer ( Mr.,39
NA,"Harold Holt) has announced that in future,",39
NA,"under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme,",39
NA,a charge of 5s. will be made for every,39
NA,doctor's prescription that is presented to,39
NA,a chemist. There mav be same excep-,39
NA,tions which I will mention later. But is,39
NA,it proper for the Treasurer to bring down,39
NA,a Budget which leaves the pensioners in,39
NA,fear of having to pay 5s. for every pre-,39
NA,scription they have made up? Child,39
NA,"endowment, maternity allowances and all",39
NA,other social service benefits have been,39
NA,ignored by the Government. Possibly when,39
NA,the next election year comes round,39
NA,increases in these payments will be offered,39
NA,to the people as a sop. Supporters of this,39
NA,Government often condemn the Labour,39
NA,"Government of New South Wales, but",39
NA,were it not for that Government it would,39
NA,be impossible for pensioners in that State,39
NA,to carry on.,39
NA,Some people suggest that I speak for the,39
NA,pensioners only because I want their vote.,39
NA,My reply is that at the last election my,39
NA,majority was the unlucky number of,39
NA,"13,000. There is no need for me to speak",39
NA,on behalf of the pensioners to gain their,39
NA,"votes, but any man who does not speak",39
NA,on their behalf is not worthy of a seat,39
NA,in this Parliament. They are the people,39
NA,who pioneered this country. During this,39
NA,debate Ministers have referred to people,39
NA,who have been thrifty and those who have,39
NA,not. I remind those Ministers that until a,39
NA,few years ago the basic wage was only,39
NA,Â£3 10s. or Â£4 a week. Many workers,39
NA,reared families on that income. Were they,39
NA,not thrifty? Many of the men and their,39
NA,sons went to the war and fought for their,39
NA,countrv. But now many of them are,39
NA,subject to the means test in order to,39
NA,qualify for a pension. The best deal these,39
NA,people ever received was given to them by,39
NA,the Labour Party. The means test should,39
NA,be abolished. It is a disgrace to think that,39
NA,"inspectors, receiving Â£20 or Â£30 a week,",39
NA,visit the back doors of homes where pen-,39
NA,sioners live and ask all sorts of questions.,39
NA,They want to know who lives in the front,39
NA,"room, whether the woman in the house",39
NA,"is the pensioner's wife or his de facto wife,",39
NA,or whether a pensioner's wife has left him.,39
NA,It is totally wrong that these people should,39
NA,be subject to such inquiries in respect of,39
NA,"entitlement to a pension. Even then, the",39
NA,amount they are given is far below what,39
NA,they need to live in any degree of comfort.,39
NA,The Labour Government in New South,39
NA,Wales helps the pensioners in a big way.,39
NA,The Commonwealth Government is seeking,39
NA,to take credit for increasing pensions by,39
NA,"7s. 6d. a week to Â£4 15s., but that is",39
NA,nothing compared with what the New,39
NA,South Wales Government is doing. Its,39
NA,social welfare organization provides cloth-,39
NA,"ing and blankets for pensioners, and if they",39
NA,"are in need of spectacles, hearing aids or",39
NA,"dentures, they can obtain them without",39
NA,cost. This Government provides a,39
NA,funeral allowance of only Â£10. That is,39
NA,far from enough to give any person a,39
NA,decent burial. On several occasions mem-,40
NA,bers from this side have asked the Minis-,40
NA,ter for Social Services to increase this,40
NA,"amount, but he has refused to do so.",40
NA,The New South Wales Government pro-,40
NA,"vides free milk for pensioners, and also",40
NA,helps them to meet ambulance service,40
NA,charges. The widow I spoke about earlier,40
NA,received bills from the local ambulance,40
NA,for Â£14 or Â£15. It was impossible for her,40
NA,"to pay this amount, but the Government",40
NA,of New South Wales came to her aid and,40
NA,met the cost in full.,40
NA,"Each year, the Sydney City Council gives",40
NA,a week's employment to the pensioners.,40
NA,"Last year, this cost Â£60,000. It also remits",40
NA,the rates of any widow who lives in her,40
NA,own home and is solely dependent on her,40
NA,pension. The State Government reim-,40
NA,burses the Sydney City Council to half,40
NA,the cost involved in giving this assistance,40
NA,to pensioners. Were it not for the State,40
NA,"Government and the Sydney City Council,",40
NA,these people would not be able to live.,40
NA,That would certainly be the case if they,40
NA,had to depend upon the Prime Minister,40
NA,( Mr Menzies) or the Minister for Social,40
NA,Services for help. The meals-on-wheels,40
NA,scheme renders wonderful help to pen-,40
NA,"sioners in New South Wales. Once a day,",40
NA,a hot meal is supplied to them for the low,40
NA,"cost of 2s. But for this, their prospect of",40
NA,getting sufficient food would be very poor,40
NA,indeed.,40
NA,On previous occasions I have referred,40
NA,the Pioneers Ball which is held each year right to live.,40
NA,"in the Sydney Town Hall. Strange to say,",40
NA,some people have told me that I should not,40
NA,"mention such a thing over the air. Surely,",40
NA,the trash and nonsense I hear over the air,40
NA,should not take preference over what,40
NA,being done for the pensioners. On 16th,40
NA,"October next, this ball will be held again",40
NA,from 8 o'clock at night until 2 o'clock next,40
NA,"morning. Sir Edward Halstrom, the",40
NA,"great animal lover, has never failed",40
NA,donate a refrigerator to help this good,40
NA,"cause. Also, Halvic Industries, whose",40
NA,factory is in the electorate of the honorable,40
NA,"member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner), who",40
NA,"yesterday condemned the Government, could",40
NA,takes a practical interest in doing something,40
NA,on behalf of these poor people. The,40
NA,manager of that company provides a but,40
NA,valuable prize each year.,40
NA,"But that is not enough. Indeed, it should",40
NA,not be necessary for organizations of this,40
NA,kind to have to do such things to help the,40
NA,pensioners. The Treasurer has brought,40
NA,down a budget dealing with a total sum of,40
NA,"Â£1,600,000,000. Is not the Government",40
NA,ashamed that out of that vast amount it is,40
NA,to provide a paltry 7s. 6d. a week for the,40
NA,"pensioners, of which it will take back 5s.",40
NA,"for medical prescriptions? If a pensioner,",40
NA,"who receives only Â£4 15s. a week, earns",40
NA,Â£2 or more a week he loses his medical,40
NA,card. I know of pensioners who go to the,40
NA,Sydney city markets and in return for mind-,40
NA,ing a cab they are given a few apples or a,40
NA,"cabbage. But every day, social service",40
NA,inspectors are there also watching to see,40
NA,how much the pensioners get for doing,40
NA,such odd jobs. That is a disgraceful state,40
NA,of affairs.,40
NA,There are many more matters I should,40
NA,"like to speak about, but time will not permit",40
NA,me to do so. I visited South America last,40
NA,year and I saw there some conditions which,40
NA,resemble those in Australia. I attended a,40
NA,conference of the Inter-Parliamentary,40
NA,Union at Rio de Janeiro. Some of the,40
NA,newspapers have complained that they were,40
NA,not told what happened at that conference.,40
NA,"I can tell them that as a result of it, there",40
NA,is no need to be afraid of the possibility,40
NA,that nuclear weapons or atomic bombs will,40
NA,be used in warfare at least in the imme-,40
NA,diate future. At that conference which was,40
NA,representative of all nations many matters,40
NA,"were discussed, and it declared that people",40
NA,to in every part of the world should have the,40
NA,But in the countries which I visited I,40
NA,was deeply distressed by the extreme wealth,40
NA,and extreme poverty which existed side by,40
NA,is side. In Brazil we were taken to many,40
NA,beautiful palaces-almos t every important,40
NA,building seemed to be a palace-an d the,40
NA,day before we left we were taken 500 miles,40
NA,inland to the new capital city of that,40
NA,to country. We saw many workers as we,40
NA,drove along and they seemed to be poverty,40
NA,stricken. As we passed a mountain which,40
NA,was pointed out to me I was informed that,40
NA,every night workers climbed it as best they,40
NA,because there were no roads and slept,40
NA,in the open. In the day time no sign of a,40
NA,"house could be seen on the mountain side,",40
NA,at night the lights from the camp fires,40
NA,seemed to be as numerous as the stars.,40
NA,The highest wage paid for manual labour,40
NA,in Rio de Janeiro is about Â£15 a month.,40
NA,This is the sum earned by drivers of buses,41
NA,or tramcars. That is an example of ex-,41
NA,treme wealth side by side with extreme,41
NA,poverty. A similar state of affairs exists,41
NA,"in New York, and in nearly every other",41
NA,great city that we visited.,41
NA,"Australia is, perhaps, one of the best",41
NA,countries in the world. It would be the,41
NA,best country in the world if it were not,41
NA,for the Liberal and Australian Country,41
NA,Party Administration which is in charge of,41
NA,affairs. The Government has provided a,41
NA,"terrific amount of money for defence, and",41
NA,it has arranged substantial increases in the,41
NA,salaries and allowances of members of the,41
NA,"Parliament, but it has not done the right",41
NA,thing by the pensioners. The Prime Minis-,41
NA,ter has said that there is no sign of war,41
NA,at present and that the possibility of war,41
NA,within the next few years is very remote.,41
NA,In that case why does the Government in-,41
NA,"tend to spend nearly Â£200,000.000 on",41
NA,defence? The Minister for the Army ( Mr.,41
NA,Cramer) last night told us about the peace-,41
NA,loving people whom he had met during his,41
NA,travels. He has no regard tor the com-,41
NA,mon people. When he was chairman of,41
NA,"the Sydney County Council, there was a",41
NA,black-out every time a by-election was con-,41
NA,ducted in the metropolitan area. He has,41
NA,not improved since that time. He and I,41
NA,were aldermen on the Sydney City Coun-,41
NA,"cil, and we were also members of the",41
NA,Sydney County Council. On one occasion,41
NA,during an inspection of a mine we lost our,41
NA,"lamps, and we prayed that we might get",41
NA,"out of the mine safely. We did, and when",41
NA,"we reached the surface he said, "" No one",41
NA,will ever hear me say another word about,41
NA,"miners"". But he has now changed his",41
NA,attitude.,41
NA,The honorable member for Grayndler,41
NA,( Mr Daly) said last night that the Governcomplaint,41
NA,"ment, by its Budget, would waste am",41
NA,"Â£50,000,000. One can imagine the benesector",41
NA,"fits that would flow to the pensioners,",41
NA,"people who need assistance most, if pride",41
NA,"Â£10,000,000, Â£15,000,000 or Â£20,000,000",41
NA,were devoted to their cause.,41
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The honortwo,41
NA,able member's time has expired.,41
Mr IAN ALLAN ,Gwydir) [3.27] -,41
NA,"The debate on the Budget, which has conmary",41
NA,"tinued for the past fortnight, has been",41
NA,dull. I am grateful to the honorable mem-,41
NA,ber for West Sydney ( Mr Minogue) for the,41
NA,way in which he has livened up pro-,41
NA,ceedings.,41
NA,I congratulate the Treasurer ( Mr.,41
NA,Harold Holt) on the presentation of his,41
NA,first Budget. Although the effect of the,41
NA,Budget provisions will not be inconsequen-,41
NA,"tial, the Budget is more superficial than",41
NA,we have been accustomed to expect in,41
NA,recent years. I do not think that it will,41
NA,have any profound overall effect on the,41
NA,country. The proposed increases in post-,41
NA,"age charges, and the fact that the Govern-",41
NA,"ment has budgeted for a large deficit, are",41
NA,"indeed weighty matters. Of course, honor-",41
NA,able members must realize that this is the,41
NA,first Budget introduced by the Treasurer,41
NA,"very shortly after he assumed office, and",41
NA,it is difficult to introduce radical changes,41
NA,and bold innovations at a first attempt. It,41
NA,is also difficult to introduce anything novel,41
NA,at a time when the country is moving,41
NA,"along so buoyantly, expanding so rapidly",41
NA,and holding so firmly the confidence of the,41
NA,business community. I am sure that the,41
NA,Treasurer did not wish to make any great,41
NA,"changes because his predecessor in office,",41
NA,"Sir Arthur Fadden, in the long years that",41
NA,"he held the portfolio, did much to bring",41
NA,about the prosperity that we now enjoy.,41
NA,I hope that in future budgets the Trea-,41
NA,surer will be in a position to make some,41
NA,of the changes that are necessary to keep,41
NA,our financial machinery abreast of the times,41
NA,so that the expansion and development now,41
NA,taking place in Australia may continue.,41
NA,This Budget has a shght bias in favour,41
NA,of the manufacturing sector of the eco-,41
NA,nomy. Speaking as a representative of one,41
NA,of the greatest pastoral and agricultural,41
NA,"regions in the Commonwealth, I have no",41
NA,"to make about that. In fact, I",41
NA,pleased to see that the manufacturing,41
NA,"is receiving attention, because we",41
NA,the in the country share the manufacturers',41
NA,in the way in which Australian indus-,41
NA,try has expanded in the last few years under,41
NA,the guidance of this Government. We are,41
NA,conscious also of the fact that in the next,41
NA,or three years we must provide more,41
NA,job opportunities. To do this we must,41
NA,have expanding secondary industries. Pri-,41
NA,producers rely upon manufacturers to,41
NA,very provide them with the best possible home,41
NA,market for their commodities. We in the,42
NA,country welcome any encouragement given,42
NA,to manufacturers which will lead to expand-,42
NA,ing and more efficient secondary industries.,42
NA,Some idea of the effect of this bias on,42
NA,the Budget may be obtained from the,42
NA,"editorial in the August, 1959, issue of",42
NA,""" Industry To-day"", which is the official",42
NA,publication of the Victorian Chamber of,42
NA,Manufactures. The editorial made certain,42
NA,claims for concessions on behalf of private,42
NA,companies-th e Budget granted those con-,42
NA,cessions. It sought a reduction in income,42
NA,tax-th e Budget granted that reduction. It,42
NA,asked that the Government cease the,42
NA,practice of using current Government,42
NA,revenue for capital works and services-,42
NA,the Budget met that request by the changes,42
NA,proposed in the accounting procedure in,42
NA,the Post Office. Various other requests,42
NA,were made in the editorial to which I have,42
NA,"referred, all of which have been met in one",42
NA,way or another. A bias does exist towards,42
NA,"the manufacturing sector but, so long as",42
NA,secondary industries are encouraged to be-,42
NA,"come more efficient we, who represent the",42
NA,great primary industries which produce the,42
NA,goods that give us the overseas funds that,42
NA,"we need, have no criticism to offer.",42
NA,"It must be remembered, however, that",42
NA,large proportion of fhe manufacturers,42
NA,Australia are not interested in maintaining,42
NA,"or achieving efficiency, 'high productivity",42
NA,or a high rate of turnover at low prices.,42
NA,They have been cushioned for so long that,42
NA,they find it a good deal easier and more,42
NA,advantageous to kick along the inflationary,42
NA,"spiral. That section o'f industry, which",42
NA,"damage our economy, is not worthy of",42
NA,assistance.,42
NA,Tbe meat that is missing from this,42
NA,Budget sandwich is the encouragement to,42
NA,industry to raise the productivity of Ausof,42
NA,tralia by the implementation by the,42
NA,vernment of a definite plan designed to,42
NA,raise the country's total wealth. That meat,42
NA,-should be sandwiched between the careful,42
NA,balancing that has taken place between,42
NA,"-capital goods and consumer goods, on",42
NA,"one hand, and between loan expenditure",42
NA,".and revenue expenditure, on the other.",42
NA,I submit three proposals for the,42
NA,sideration of the Government during the,42
NA,inext year or two. I believe that these pro-,42
NA,posals would supply what is now lacking,42
NA,from the current Budget. They are pro-,42
NA,posals designed to put the missing meat into,42
NA,the sandwich and increase the wealth of,42
NA,Australia.,42
NA,The honorable member for West,42
NA,Sydney spoke about the pensioners.,42
NA,They and every one else have a direct,42
NA,interest in increasing the total wealth of,42
NA,Australia. We must not become obsessed,42
NA,with the idea of cutting up the cake into,42
NA,even smaller fragments. We must not,42
NA,forget that our real aim is to bake a bigger,42
NA,"cake. Therefore, I suggest to the Govern-",42
NA,"ment, first, that it should do something",42
NA,about our wage-costs treadmill. This exists,42
NA,"in all Western countries, including the",42
NA,United States of America and the United,42
NA,Kingdom. We have done less about it than,42
NA,any of the other countries. It is possible,42
NA,"that we require to do less because, to a",42
NA,"very large extent, the Tariff Board, which",42
NA,"is very much alive to its responsibilities, is",42
NA,helping to keep costs down in this country.,42
NA,"However, we have to realize that price",42
NA,fixation is just as important in checking the,42
NA,spiral of costs as is the fixation of wage,42
NA,"levels. For very long, now, the arbitration",42
NA,system has been bumping up wage levels.,42
NA,The increased wage rates have been,42
NA,a followed immediately by increased prices,42
NA,of which have robbed fhe wage earner of all,42
NA,the benefits that he has been granted by,42
NA,the court. But that is not the worst of it.,42
NA,The whole process of wages chasing prices,42
NA,"has encouraged the inefficient manufacturer,",42
NA,"the inefficient supplier of services, and the",42
NA,"inefficient producer, and it has loaded the",42
NA,can country with a burden that has put us out,42
NA,any of step with the rest of the world. The,42
NA,wages-prices spiral has resulted in,42
NA,increasing inflationary pressures in this,42
NA,country. We are out of step with the rest,42
NA,the world -because other countries are,42
NA,Goundertaking deflation and correction of,42
NA,those evils that we are allowing to persist.,42
NA,I invite the Governnaent's attention to the,42
NA,Cohen report which was published in the,42
NA,the United Kingdom about three weeks ago.,42
NA,It is the report of three wise men in that,42
NA,"country who were given the task, a year or",42
NA,"so ago, of studying wages, .prices and pro-",42
NA,conductivity. The proposals of the Cohen,42
NA,"committee, to our way .of thinking, are quite",42
NA,-revolutionary. There is no need for us to,42
NA,apply the rigorous price control recom-,43
NA,mended by the Cohen committee because,43
NA,we have a different set of conditions here.,43
NA,But at least we have a very powerful argu-,43
NA,ment for the introduction of a restrictive,43
NA,practices court such as has been operating,43
NA,in the United Kingdom and the United,43
NA,States of America.,43
NA,That is one way in which we could check,43
NA,price fixation by industry without inter-,43
NA,fering with the efficient manufacturer. All,43
NA,"the honest conscientious manufacturers, of",43
NA,whom there are quite a few in the com-,43
NA,"munity, look to the Government for a",43
NA,lead. They try their utmost to absorb,43
NA,wage increases and the Government has a,43
NA,duty to help them. One way in which the,43
NA,Government can help them is by instituting,43
NA,either a monopolies commission or a re-,43
NA,"strictive practices court, or both, and so",43
NA,bringing the light of day to bear on some,43
NA,of the price-fixing arrangements that,43
NA,operate in this country and which lead to,43
NA,gross inefficiency and place a burden not,43
NA,merely on exporters but on the whole,43
NA,community.,43
NA,The next proposal that I make to the,43
NA,Government is that it should do something,43
NA,positive to foster import-saving industries.,43
NA,I have in mind particularly the agricultural,43
NA,"industries of cotton, tobacco and oil seeds",43
NA,"-crop s which can be grown abundantly,",43
NA,widely and easily in Australia. All that is,43
NA,needed is a positive lead from this Govern-,43
NA,ment through the Australian Agricultural,43
NA,"Council. So far, the tide for the Agricul-",43
NA,tural Council has run from the States to,43
NA,the Commonwealth. It is about time that,43
NA,the Commonwealth took the initiative and,43
NA,organized a national plan such as I have,43
NA,suggested for developing these industries.,43
NA,This would save us a large amount in over-,43
NA,seas funds paid for imports. It would also,43
NA,have another effect of which I shall speak,43
NA,in a moment and which I believe is of vast,43
NA,importance.,43
NA,The argument against doing anything is,43
NA,that we might as well receive cotton from,43
NA,the United States of America where it is,43
NA,subsidized to the extent of 8d. per lb.,43
NA,"the United States Government, and that",43
NA,might as well go on receiving vegetable,43
NA,"oils which, through the operation of the",43
NA,"P.L.480 scheme in the United States,",43
NA,cheap and in abundance throughout the,43
NA,world. The aid schemes that are operated,43
NA,by the United States are flooding,43
NA,world market with vegetable oils and this,43
NA,is having its effect on price levels. The,43
NA,argument is that it would be wise for us,43
NA,to go on buying cheap oil from abroad,43
NA,rather than produce it ourselves.,43
NA,The same argument is applied to tobacco.,43
NA,"It is asked, "" Why not buy cheap tobacco",43
NA,from abroad rather than grow it our-,43
NA,"selves? "" I shall counter that with a pro-",43
NA,posal which I believe is of tremendous im-,43
NA,"portance and which, to my mind, con-",43
NA,clusively overshadows that argument. Any,43
NA,one who knows the countryside is aware,43
NA,that sharp fluctuations occur in the income,43
NA,of different regions because of sharp fluc-,43
NA,tuations in climate or in overseas prices.,43
NA,One region may go ahead in prosperity for,43
NA,"four years, then strike a lean year or a",43
NA,lean two or three years when there is no,43
NA,great return and the whole region stagnates.,43
NA,That is occurring in some part of the,43
NA,Commonwealth all the time. It is the,43
NA,sort of thing that does not show up in,43
NA,statistics yet this wild fluctuation of in-,43
NA,comes in the different country regions holds,43
NA,"back, more than does inflation, the pro-",43
NA,vision of funds for investment and the pro-,43
NA,vision of proper amenities in the country-,43
NA,side.,43
NA,If we could have some stability of in-,43
NA,come throughout the countryside we would,43
NA,have the right climate for the continued,43
NA,flow of investment money. There would,43
NA,be a continual unchecked development of,43
NA,our rural industries and the countryside,43
NA,would be provided with amenities that it,43
NA,does not have at the present time. With,43
NA,a plan to develop our import saving in-,43
NA,dustries throughout the nation we would,43
NA,help to diversify production over the length,43
NA,and breadth of the countryside and we,43
NA,would help to stabilize the level of incomes,43
NA,throughout the countryside. That would,43
NA,have rapid and profound effects on the,43
NA,future welfare and continuing progress,43
NA,of our country towns and country regions.,43
NA,That is the argument advanced against,43
NA,those who believe that we should rely upon,43
NA,by receiving this kind of assistance from the,43
NA,we United States of America. We owe it to,43
NA,the primary producers and people in coun-,43
NA,try towns to do something positive to help,43
NA,are them stabilize their incomes and obtain,43
NA,some of the comforts and amenities that,43
NA,people in the cities enjoy. That could be,43
NA,the done in the way I have suggested.,43
NA,"Finally, I propose that the Government",44
NA,should pay attention to the financial rela-,44
NA,tions between the Commonwealth and the,44
NA,"States. Only recently, the Treasurer",44
NA,negotiated an agreement to regulate Com-,44
NA,monwealth and State relations for the next,44
NA,six years. I deplore that agreement. I,44
NA,think it is the worst thing that has been,44
NA,done for many years. Nothing could,44
NA,damage the cause of federalism more than,44
NA,avoiding the search for a solution to the,44
NA,present problem of financial relations be-,44
NA,"tween the Commonwealth and the States,",44
NA,yet that is just what this agreement does.,44
NA,It avoids finding a remedy. The possibility,44
NA,of finding a solution has been postponed,44
NA,for six years. Why not admit that the States,44
NA,"will not get back their taxing powers, that",44
NA,uniform taxation is here to stay? It is,44
NA,impossible and impracticable to return the,44
NA,powers to levy income tax formerly enjoyed,44
NA,by the States. Let us admit that. We,44
NA,should then admit that a very large volume,44
NA,of the taxpayers' funds is being passed,44
NA,over by the Commonwealth to the States,44
NA,to be controlled and spent by them. The,44
NA,States do not have to account to the tax-,44
NA,payers for that money. Such an arrange-,44
NA,ment is conducive to bad administration.,44
NA,It has already had the effect of leading to,44
NA,irresponsibility and maladministration,44
NA,throughout the States of the Common-,44
NA,wealth. By delaying the possibility of,44
NA,"ing a solution to this problem for six years,",44
NA,the Commonwealth Government is not,44
NA,living up to its obligations or its ideals.,44
NA,know that this Government believes in,44
NA,"federalism, but it is not living up to this",44
NA,ideal or to its obligations to the taxpayers.,44
NA,We owe it to the taxpayers to ensure that,44
NA,every Â£1 of their money that we receive is,44
NA,spent as wisely and fruitfully as possible.,44
NA,We cannot do that under the present,44
NA,arrangement.,44
NA,"Therefore, I suggest to the Government",44
NA,that it should do what it can to take over,44
NA,the functions of the States within the limits,44
NA,of the Constitution. If we set out to,44
NA,"explore those limits in this connexion, I",44
NA,sure we would find a number of different,44
NA,points of entry. There are a number of,44
NA,different functions we could take over from,44
NA,"the States one way or another, not with",44
NA,view to destroying the States but with,44
NA,cisely opposite objectives. We would,44
NA,strengthen the States and make them more,44
NA,responsible if we limited their functions,44
NA,and powers to their own taxing capacity,44
NA,"so that they would be strong, viable units",44
NA,"of the Commonwealth. In that way, we",44
NA,would ensure that Australian administra-,44
NA,tion generally was made as efficient as pos-,44
NA,"sible. For example, we could take over",44
NA,the transport field to a large extent. We,44
NA,do not know quite how far we could go,44
NA,as the Commissioner of Commonwealth,44
NA,Railways has already suggested that there,44
NA,are provisions in the Constitution for the,44
NA,formation of an interstate commission,44
NA,which would allow the Commonwealth to,44
NA,enter the interstate transport field. Once,44
NA,"that was done, the Commonwealth would",44
NA,have a controlling influence throughout,44
NA,the transport sector of the economy. The,44
NA,Commonwealth Government must show,44
NA,"initiative, drive and determination in that",44
NA,direction to live up to its obligations to,44
NA,the Australian community.,44
NA,"Sir, I repeat that our objective in",44
NA,financial matters should be to help the,44
NA,country to bake a larger cake. It is true,44
NA,that that cannot be done entirely by the,44
NA,Treasurer. It is not altogether a budgetary,44
NA,"matter, but the Budget provides a con-",44
NA,venient time to indicate the Government's,44
NA,determination to act along this line. It is,44
NA,a convenient time for the Government to,44
NA,find- indicate its policy and its plans.,44
NA,"During the course of this debate, honor-",44
NA,able members have referred to the number,44
NA,I of jobs which must be provided this year,44
NA,and in the years to come. I warn the,44
NA,Government that in five years' time a very,44
NA,large number of youngsters will be enter-,44
NA,ing the employment market looking for,44
NA,opportunities and for careers not only in,44
NA,Australia but in every western country.,44
NA,"In five years' time, therefore, we will have",44
NA,a very intensive trade war on our hands.,44
NA,Unless we make this country efficient and,44
NA,"strong now, not simply by annual account-",44
NA,"ing, but by long-range planning and deter-",44
NA,"mination, we will be in a very difficult posi-",44
NA,tion when that time arrives in 1965 or,44
NA,am thereabouts. We are a great trading nation.,44
NA,We must plan forward and act aggressively,44
NA,and vigorously to implement those plans.,44
Mr GRIFFITHS ,Shortland) [3.53] - I,44
NA,a agree with the honorable member for,44
NA,preGwydir ( Mr Ian Allan) that the Govern-,44
NA,ment should bake a bigger cake; but I,44
NA,also suggest that the Government should,45
NA,cut it up more evenly and distribute it,45
NA,among the people to better advantage. The,45
NA,statement of the Prime Minister ( Mr.,45
NA,Menzies) last week that the Government,45
NA,intended to review its proposed increases,45
NA,in postal charges must have been like a,45
NA,breath of fresh air to those organizations,45
NA,which were likely to go out of business,45
NA,when the higher charges became operative.,45
NA,There is no doubt that the numerous pro-,45
NA,tests against these imposts and the wielding,45
NA,of the big stick by the Australian Country,45
NA,"Party have had their effect. However, I",45
NA,want to record my protest against the,45
NA,"charges, especially as they affect private",45
NA,operative organizations such as the National,45
NA,Roads and Motorists Association. The,45
NA,"N.R.M.A. distributes about 400,000 copies",45
NA,of its journal to its members each month.,45
NA,This journal is of very great value to,45
NA,members of the N.R.M.A. It appears to,45
NA,me that once again the motoring public are,45
NA,to be the victims of this rapacious Govern-,45
NA,"ment in its drive for more revenue, and",45
NA,I ask ths Government to consider reviewing,45
NA,the increases with a view to withdrawing,45
NA,the proposals.,45
NA,"In fact, I think the Government should",45
NA,"completely recast the Budget, and spread",45
NA,more evenly among the people the benefits,45
NA,that it contains. The Budget is somewhat,45
NA,disappointing. I think that it is more,45
NA,dishonest than any of the other nine,45
NA,budgets for which the Menzies Govern-,45
NA,ment has been responsible. It is a rich,45
NA,man's Budget. It strikes at the meagre,45
NA,resources of every worker while at the,45
NA,same time it hands out fabulous conces-,45
NA,sions to the wealthy. I feel that the basic,45
NA,problems confronting the community to-day,45
NA,are the cost structure and its impact on the,45
NA,economy. Its effect is closely linked with,45
NA,the steeply-mounting national debt and its,45
NA,terrific burden of interest payments.,45
NA,I should have liked to see the Govern-,45
NA,ment tackle the problem of the national,45
NA,"debt, because in my view the Government",45
NA,will never get control of the inflation that,45
NA,"is strangling the economy, nor will it check",45
NA,"rising costs, so long as it follows its present",45
NA,fiscal policy. The whole question of the,45
NA,"improvement of living standards, produc-",45
NA,"tion, expansion, employment, increased",45
NA,"social services, imports and exports, and",45
NA,the general welfare of the Australian,45
NA,"people, is bound up with the Government's",45
NA,fiscal and monetary policies. Even the,45
NA,"National Bank, which can hardly be",45
NA,described as a friend of Labour or of the,45
NA,"working class, in its monthly economic",45
NA,"survey, expressed disappointment with the",45
NA,Budget. It said-,45
NA,"In fact, the concessions will not impose any",45
NA,"real costs on Commonwealth finances, as it is",45
NA,estimated that increasing incomes and population,45
NA,"will raise tax receipts by no less than Â£80,000,000",45
NA,this year.,45
NA,"It will be seen by that statement, Mr.",45
NA,"Temporary Chairman, that even private",45
NA,sources indicate that the Government's,45
NA,co- income this year will be much greater than,45
NA,"the Government concedes. Last year, the",45
NA,Government budgeted for the use of,45
NA,"Â£110,000,000 of central bank funds to",45
NA,"balance its budget, rather than cut depart-",45
NA,mental votes or restrict imports. For-,45
NA,"tunately, it did not need most of that sum,",45
NA,as it was able to use income from trust,45
NA,"funds which, to my mind, is an action also",45
NA,"subject to criticism. This year, the Govern-",45
NA,"ment will seek to use Â£61,000,000 from",45
NA,the same source. I should like to know,45
NA,why there is all this humbug and hypocrisy,45
NA,on the part of the Government about,45
NA,"central bank funds, when the Prime",45
NA,Minister knows full well that any,45
NA,government will use them to suit its,45
NA,own requirements. Perhaps the Treasurer,45
NA,( Mr Harold Holt) might tell us why those,45
NA,funds are being used in the defence vote,45
NA,rather than in the vote for some other,45
NA,department. Why are such funds not,45
NA,included in the Post Office appropriation,45
NA,or in the vote for the Snowy Mountains,45
NA,Hydro-electric scheme? Can their use in,45
NA,the defence vote be more easily covered,45
NA,up? Or what is the reason?,45
NA,"For my part, I suggest that the defence",45
NA,"vote of Â£192,000,000 is one of the greatest",45
NA,rackets on earth. It is certainly the most,45
NA,inflationary item of our expenditure.,45
NA,National service training is the greatest,45
NA,rort that I know of. Apart from its physical,45
NA,"aspect, in that the training helps to develop",45
NA,"many of our young folk, the money spent",45
NA,"on it is just wasted. Naturally, the top",45
NA,brass and the instructors from the regular,45
NA,"Army want to keep it going, as it is a good",45
NA,cop for them. Week-end camps are simply,45
NA,"a farce, and the quicker they are dis-",45
NA,continued the better for everybody.,45
NA,Will the Treasurer tell the Parliament,46
NA,"and the people what the Â£37,000,000 approachieving.",46
NA,priated last year from loan funds for,46
NA,defence was used for? Was it used,46
NA,purchase equipment or food or was it used,46
NA,"to pay wages? What will the Â£37,000,000",46
NA,provided in this Budget be used for,46
NA,same department? I suggest that the,46
NA,"formation could be of enormous value,",46
NA,because it would illustrate to some degree,46
NA,whether or not central bank funds could,46
NA,used as extensively by a Labour governmotor,46
NA,ment as they are apparently being used,46
NA,this Government. I make no apology for,46
NA,saying that I believe that central bank,46
NA,will have to be used far more extensively,46
NA,"than is now the case, if the nation",46
NA,develop in keeping with the development,46
NA,taking place in Communist countries.,46
NA,The action of the Government in its,46
NA,savage imposition of increased postal rates,46
NA,"reeks of dishonesty, and reminds me of",46
NA,imposition of sales tax on ice cream in,46
NA,"1952-53 horror budget. In that year,",46
NA,Arthur Fadden found that a tax on ice,46
NA,cream would return the Government,46
NA,"handsome profit, because ice cream",46
NA,then being used by every family as a food.,46
NA,It was no longer a child's delicacy.,46
NA,tax still remains. The Government has,46
NA,failed to remove it because it is a,46
NA,"money spinner. The ice cream tax, Mr.",46
NA,"Temporary Chairman, and now the inthe",46
NA,"creased postal charges, remind me of",46
NA,centuries-old salt tax of China. Many,46
NA,"hundreds of years ago, the Chinese rulers",46
NA,"found that every Chinese used salt, so",46
NA,imposed a salt tax on the population.,46
NA,"salt tax still remains in China, even though",46
NA,the Chinese people pay no direct personal,46
NA,exertion tax.,46
NA,It is my view that the crippling postal,46
NA,charges and the ice cream tax will always,46
NA,remain in this country so long as this,46
NA,vernment is allowed to remain in office. It,46
NA,"is, therefore, up to the electors to get rid",46
NA,of the Government as quickly as possible.,46
NA,"In effect, every one, rich or poor, the",46
NA,"the age and invalid pensioners, and the",46
NA,"children, all have to subscribe to the",46
NA,Government's vicious money grab.,46
NA,The theme used by the Treasurer in,46
NA,"Budget speech, and repeated by the Prime",46
NA,"Minister, was expansion, progress and",46
NA,"stability, which both speakers claimed",46
NA,Government had been responsible for,46
NA,The Treasurer repeatedly,46
NA,pointed to the achievements of the Govern-,46
NA,"to ment, of industry, and of commercial and",46
NA,financial institutions during the past year.,46
NA,The right honorable gendeman endeavoured,46
NA,by the to show how the Government's immigra-,46
NA,intion programme was assisting in the expan-,46
NA,sion of both primary and secondary indus-,46
NA,tries. He spoke of the high rate of home-,46
NA,be building and of the great number of new,46
NA,vehicles that had been registered,46
NA,by during 1958-59. Mention was made of the,46
NA,remarkable progress in industrial produc-,46
NA,funds tion. The Treasurer said that earlier there,46
NA,were to be seen crippling shortages of,46
NA,"is to materials, equipment, fuel and power,",46
NA,"which had hampered progress, but that we",46
NA,now seemed to have achieved a remarkable,46
NA,"basis of stability-economic , political, social",46
NA,"and industrial. The Treasurer, I believe,",46
NA,"the then blotted his copybook, because he had",46
NA,the been handing out bouquets to the Govern-,46
NA,"Sir ment, and taking all the kudos for the",46
NA,remarkable achievements of this country,46
NA,a during the past fifteen to twenty years.,46
NA,was The right honorable gentleman had con-,46
NA,veniently forgotten the part that the Curtin,46
NA,That and Chifley Governments had played in,46
NA,the nation's development. He had forgotten,46
NA,good that the immigration scheme about which,46
NA,he talked so much was the brain child of,46
NA,honorable member for Melbourne ( Mr.,46
NA,the Calwell). The right honorable gendeman,46
NA,also forgot that when this Government,46
NA,came to office there was an acute shortage,46
NA,they of man-power throughout the length and,46
NA,The breadth of Australia. Tens of thousands,46
NA,"of positions were vacant, thousands of",46
NA,"people had two jobs each, and employers",46
NA,were glad to take on any kind of labour.,46
NA,In those days it did not matter whether,46
NA,"or not a man had an affliction, whether he",46
NA,had a wooden leg or a bad heart; so long,46
NA,Goas he was willing to work he was employed.,46
NA,To-day the position is different. In,46
NA,"sick, many industries doctors examine appli-",46
NA,cants for employment to see whether they,46
NA,are in good health. If there is any sign of,46
NA,physical disability the applicant is rejected,46
NA,and remains on the dole. Married women,46
NA,the are continually being retrenched and in,46
NA,many instances are not being replaced in,46
NA,industry because mechanized plant is,46
NA,the taking over. To-day there are more than,46
NA,"63,000 registered unemployed. In addition,",47
NA,thousands of women need work and cannot,47
NA,procure it. Literally thousands of people,47
NA,who are out of work refuse to register for,47
NA,employment because of the way in which,47
NA,they are treated at the employment office.,47
NA,Time and again unemployed men aind,47
NA,women have complained that they have,47
NA,been refused payment of the unemploy-,47
NA,ment benefit because departmental officers,47
NA,were not satisfied that they had been,47
NA,genuinely seeking employment. I think,47
NA,the Treasurer could at least have given,47
NA,the Labour government a little credit for,47
NA,its war-time and post-war achievements.,47
NA,The Treasurer's reference to the Korean,47
NA,war pin-points the thinking of most Liberal,47
NA,Party and Australian Country Party,47
NA,members so far as the economic expan-,47
NA,sion of this country is concerned. Big,47
NA,business thrives on war whilst millions of,47
NA,people perish. The Budget is a good illus-,47
NA,tration of that. If the Treasurer's state-,47
NA,ment that we have found stability-,47
NA,"economic, political, social and industrial-",47
NA,"is authentic, why the need for the increase",47
NA,in postal and telephone charges and the,47
NA,imposition of a charge for prescriptions,47
NA,issued under the pharmaceutical benefits,47
NA,scheme? If the nation has found economic,47
NA,"stability, what will the Government do",47
NA,with the hundreds of millions of pounds,47
NA,that it has filched from the taxpayers,47
NA,during the last ten years on the pretext that,47
NA,it was putting the surplus spending powei,47
NA,of the people into a safe place in order to,47
NA,curtail inflation? I ask the Treasurer why,47
NA,he is continuing to take out of the Con-,47
NA,solidated Revenue Fund millions of pounds,47
NA,each year to put it into the Loan Con-,47
NA,solidation and Investment Reserve. The,47
NA,Auditor-General's report shows that this,47
NA,"fund had a balance of Â£237,372,520 at",47
NA,"30th June last, having re-purchased",47
NA,"securities totalling Â£100,046,099. What",47
NA,were the securities re-purchased for more,47
NA,"than Â£100,000,000, and from whom were",47
NA,they re-purchased? Will the Treasurer tell,47
NA,honorable members how a loss of Â£529.190,47
NA,was incurred in the realization of invest-,47
NA,ments last year? I feel that some interesting,47
NA,revelations might flow from the details. 1,47
NA,do not suggest for one moment that there,47
NA,"is anything sinister in the transaction, but",47
NA,I do think that the disclosures that would,47
NA,flow from the information would be very,47
NA,"interesting. For instance, I think the",47
NA,statement made last year by Sir Arthur,47
NA,"Fadden, when presenting his 1958-59",47
NA,"Budget, showed quite clearly 'that this",47
NA,country had become so hopelessly in debt,47
NA,that the Australian people will forever he,47
NA,held in the vice-like grip of the financial,47
NA,institutions and money lenders. Last yeai,47
NA,"Â£363,000,000 of maturing loans had to be",47
NA,"met, and this year a similar amount will",47
NA,have to be met.,47
NA,The Treasurer said that he did not yet,47
NA,know the exact amount that bonds maturing,47
NA,"this year would represent, but he said that",47
NA,it would be a substantial amount. I under-,47
NA,stand that the amount will b.e in the vicinity,47
NA,"of Â£300,000,000. If that is so, you can",47
NA,bet any amount that again this year the,47
NA,Government will have to find a substantial,47
NA,sum for bond redemption purposes. Last,47
NA,"year, the Government found Â£72,000,000",47
NA,for that purpose and it may have to find,47
NA,a similar amount this year. I should like,47
NA,to know why the Government cannot use.,47
NA,loan funds for bond redemption just as it,47
NA,is using loan funds to balance its budget.,47
NA,It is common knowledge that numerous,47
NA,investors in Commonwealth bonds are not,47
NA,renewing them with government or semi-,47
NA,government stock. As the bonds mature,47
NA,they are withdrawn and transferred to hire-,47
NA,"purchase companies, which offer up to",47
NA,five times as much interest. The hire-,47
NA,purchase racket operating in Australia,47
NA,to-day is a positive disgrace to any,47
NA,"civilized community. This Government,",47
NA,being aware of what is happening with re-,47
NA,gard to hire-purchase finance investment in,47
NA,"Australia to-day, is guilty of encouraging",47
NA,the worst form of usury by those people.,47
NA,"More than Â£400,000,000 is now tied up in",47
NA,various hire-purchase companies. Week,47
NA,after week advertisements appear in the,47
NA,daily newspapers offering investors up to,47
NA,"20 per cent, interest on their investments.",47
NA,The bonafidesof those companies should b?,47
NA,examined. I submit that an investor can,47
NA,double his capital every five years only by,47
NA,exploitation or at the expense of the con-,47
NA,suming public. Nearly every private bank,47
NA,in the country is operating in the hire-,47
NA,purchase field in some form.,47
NA,"Properly conducted, hire purchase is good",47
NA,and essential to family life in times of high,47
NA,"costs brought about by inflation, but never",47
NA,was it more necessary than now for govern-,48
NA,ments to police hire-purchase transactions,48
NA,properly and to put a stop to inflation. In,48
NA,my view many people investing in hire,48
NA,purchase to-day are like cannibals. They are,48
NA,living off the misfortunes and needs of their,48
NA,fellows who seek finance to purchase the,48
NA,essential requirements of life.,48
NA,"Mr Temporary Chairman, earlier I was",48
NA,dealing with maturing loans and I indicated,48
NA,"that possibly Â£70,000,000 would be needed",48
NA,this year to pay bond-holders who wanted,48
NA,their money. In view of the fact that the,48
NA,Government used Â£37.000.000 last year,48
NA,"from' bank credit, or, as the Treasurer called",48
NA,"it, the loan fund, to help finance the defence",48
NA,"vote, why could not similar money be used",48
NA,to repay those investors who seek the re-,48
NA,turn of their money to invest it in hire,48
NA,chase? The national debt now stands at,48
NA,"Â£4,040,000,000. Interest payments on that",48
NA,"money total Â£147,800,406 this year. Since",48
NA,this Government came to office-i n ten,48
NA,years of Liberal-Australian Country Party,48
NA,Government-th e interest bill has practically,48
NA,"doubled, and within a year or two it will",48
NA,have doubled. Since 1949 the debt has,48
NA,"increased by Â£1,215,000,000. Are our",48
NA,people to be forever subjected to a rate of,48
NA,taxation so high that many of them will be,48
NA,crippled economically for as long as they,48
NA,live? Each year increased amounts are to,48
NA,be provided in the Budget to meet interest,48
NA,payments. I feel that eventually something,48
NA,must happen to compel governments to do,48
NA,something about this appalling position.,48
NA,I would like the Treasurer to say what,48
NA,has happened to the debt incurred in the,48
NA,building of the old Newcastle tramway,48
NA,system or the tramway systems recently,48
NA,"taken up in Castlereagh and George streets,",48
NA,"Sydney, or to the debt incurred in building",48
NA,many ships of the Royal Australian,48
NA,which have long since been sunk or broken,48
NA,up. What happens to the money owing on,48
NA,many of the old post office buildings,48
NA,"the exchange equipment, which are",48
NA,obsolete and out of use? I think it is time,48
NA,that the Government looked at the posilevel,48
NA,tion and used its loan funds provided from,48
NA,bank credit to repay loans now being,48
NA,"deemed, and thus reduce the burden of",48
NA,interest payments which the community cities.,48
NA,meets and which is becoming heavier year,48
NA,by year.,48
NA,"Let us consider the subject of exports,",48
NA,which worries the honorable member for,48
NA,Richmond ( Mr Anthony). I agree with him,48
NA,that a high export market does provide,48
NA,prosperity not only to rural communities,48
NA,but to the nation as a whole. But he and,48
NA,his colleagues disregard completely the,48
NA,"ability of the home market to do likewise,",48
NA,provided the people are allowed to work and,48
NA,obtain a decent standard of living. A high,48
NA,standard of living can only be obtained by,48
NA,full employment. Increased rural consump-,48
NA,tion can be obtained by increased social ser-,48
NA,"vice benefits, better education, better hous-",48
NA,"ing, increased water and sewerage facilities",48
NA,and better roads. High costs can be re-,48
NA,duced by a reduction of the national debt,48
NA,and the excessively high interest bill that the,48
NA,people are called upon to meet every year.,48
NA,This year the interest bill on the national,48
NA,"pur- debt, which stands at approximately",48
NA,"Â£4,000,000,000, will be approximately",48
NA,"Â£147,000,000. If those two items could be",48
NA,reduced we would be well on the way to,48
NA,"stabilizing and reducing the cost structure,",48
NA,about which the honorable member for,48
NA,Richmond was so concerned.,48
NA,It is my view that in future Australia will,48
NA,need to concentrate on consuming more of,48
NA,"its primary production at home, while at",48
NA,the same time increasing exports to Asia of,48
NA,"secondary products, such as electronic",48
NA,"equipment and the like. I consider that,",48
NA,"within the next few years, China will offer",48
NA,an excellent market for the export of elec-,48
NA,"trical goods, because she is extremely short",48
NA,"of that kind of equipment. I believe, also,",48
NA,that as that country develops industrially,48
NA,"it could become an exporter of oil, and,",48
NA,"China being within the sterling bloc, that",48
NA,could mean a great deal to Australia.,48
NA,The need to increase the standard of,48
NA,living of those pensioners who receive the,48
NA,Navy basic pension and those persons who,48
NA,depend on other social service benefits can-,48
NA,not be too strongly emphasized. Nor can,48
NA,and we overlook the need to re-employ the,48
NA,"now 63,000 persons who are out of work.",48
NA,These matters should be coupled with the,48
NA,of the consumption of primary pro-,48
NA,ducts and the need to undertake reproduc-,48
NA,retive works such as water and sewerage,48
NA,schemes in big country centres and the,48
NA,It is a positive and everlasting dis-,48
NA,grace that areas within 10 miles or less of,48
NA,"the general post offices in Brisbane, Sydney,",48
NA,Melbourne and other capital cities are not,48
NA,sewered. I should like to hear the views,48
NA,of members of the Australian Country,49
NA,Party on this subject. Here we have a,49
NA,class of work that is urgently required in,49
NA,almost every large centre. All the material,49
NA,required is in abundant supply in this,49
NA,"country, and all the necessary machinery",49
NA,can be manufactured here. Why do we,49
NA,"allow 63,000 men and women to be out",49
NA,of work when work on such projects is,49
NA,"waiting for them? Last year, a total of",49
NA,"Â£8,652,000 was paid out in unemployment",49
NA,and sickness benents. Why could the,49
NA,Government not provide the additional,49
NA,funds to pay wages and provide the equip-,49
NA,ment needed to carry out the work that,49
NA,I have mentioned?,49
NA,The employment of workers on these,49
NA,projects would not entail the expenditure,49
NA,"of overseas funds, and the workers involved",49
NA,would spend their earnings on the con-,49
NA,sumption of products from our own fac-,49
NA,"tories and farms. In Australia to-day,",49
NA,"there are 600,000 age and invalid pen-",49
NA,"sioners, and to that number can be added",49
NA,many thousands of widows and special,49
NA,rate war pensioners. Were the Govern-,49
NA,ment to pay each pensioner another 10s.,49
NA,"a week, anything up to another Â£25,000,000",49
NA,would go into circulation each year. Most,49
NA,of it would ultimately find its way into the,49
NA,"pockets of the farming community, and",49
NA,thus lift the living standards of that sec-,49
NA,tion of the community considerably. I see,49
NA,no reason why anybody in this country,49
NA,should be unemployed. Nor do I see any,49
NA,reason why pensioners should go hungry,49
NA,while the farmers can produce a surplus,49
NA,of primary products.,49
NA,The Government's failure to assist the,49
NA,wives of invalid pensioners or the wives of,49
NA,age pensioners who are not certified as,49
NA,being permanendy incapacitated is beyond,49
NA,all reason. It appears to me that the Minis-,49
NA,ter for Social Services ( Mr Roberton) is,49
NA,quite oblivious to the hardships suffered,49
NA,by the dependants of many of our pen-,49
NA,"sioners. Mr Temporary Chairman, does",49
NA,the Government expect a woman of 55 or,49
NA,60 who has never worked in industry to,49
NA,be able to obtain employment? Thousands,49
NA,of women have been refused either a wife's,49
NA,allowance or a pension. Many of those,49
NA,who have been refused a wife's allowance,49
NA,have husbands between 65 and 70 years of,49
NA,age who are certified by doctors as being,49
NA,not permanently incapacitated for work,49
NA,although they have been retrenched from,49
NA,"industry. Relief for the wife, therefore,",49
NA,"is refused, and both the man and his wife",49
NA,have to live on a miserable Â£4 7s. 6d. a,49
NA,"week. The Government's refusal, in this",49
NA,"Budget, to increase the wife's allowance is",49
NA,"despicable, to say the least of it. Numerous",49
NA,women who are compelled to stay at home,49
NA,in order to care for invalid husbands are,49
NA,"literally slaves and are half-starved. Often,",49
NA,"the invalid requires special food, and the",49
NA,"wife then has to go without, because the",49
NA,total income of Â£6 2s. 6d. a week will not,49
NA,"go round. If there are children, the posi-",49
NA,tion is much worse.,49
NA,It is my view that the Government should,49
NA,reduce the degree of incapacity necessary in,49
NA,order to qualify for an invalid pension from,49
NA,"85 to 75 per cent, and allow the pensioner",49
NA,to earn as much as other pensioners are,49
NA,allowed to earn. I know that the Minister,49
NA,"will say that this cannot be done, but I sub-",49
NA,"mit, Mr Temporary Chairman, that it can",49
NA,be done. If a pensioner who receives a pen-,49
NA,sion because he has a heart condition under-,49
NA,takes employment of a kind that further,49
NA,"jeopardizes his health, the responsibility",49
NA,rests with the pensioner. But I feel that,49
NA,denying invalid pensioners the right to sup-,49
NA,plement their pension by more than a few,49
NA,shillings often condemns the pensioner and,49
NA,his wife to slow death.,49
NA,"Mr Temporary Chairman, I now want to",49
NA,turn for a moment to the reference to,49
NA,reduced taxation made last week by the,49
NA,"Prime Minister, who claimed that the",49
NA,Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt) had,49
NA,deliberately misstated the benefits that will,49
NA,be obtained by all wage-earners as a result,49
NA,"of the 5 per cent, reduction in income tax.",49
NA,I suggest that the boot is on the other foot,49
NA,and that it was the Prime Minister who,49
NA,endeavoured to mislead the public about the,49
NA,Government's taxation proposals. The,49
NA,general public should be told that when the,49
NA,Government compares its proposals for this,49
NA,financial year with the proposals contained,49
NA,in the Budget for the financial year 1950-51,49
NA,it should not use average wages as a guide,49
NA,to the benefits that wage-earners are likely,49
NA,to receive as a result of the present tax,49
NA,reductions. The ruse of quoting average,49
NA,"wages is deliberately misleading, and its",49
NA,use by people like the Treasurer and the,49
NA,Prime Minister is not to their credit.,49
NA,"Mr Forbes -O n a point of order, Mr.",50
NA,Temporary Chairman. I ask for your,50
NA,ruling on whether persons in the press,50

NA,"average in 1959. Neither figure is correct,",50
NA,"because, in 1950, the majority of tax-",50
NA,payers received a wage much less than,50
NA,the average figure quoted by the right,50
NA,orable gentleman; and the position to-day,50
NA,is similar. According to the statistics,50
NA,"tained in the Budget papers, in 1956-57,",50
NA,the number of taxpayers totalled,50
NA,"3,896,074, and 2,559,310 of them received",50
NA,an income of less than Â£999 for the year.,50
NA,"Mr Cope - I rise to order, Mr Tem-",50
NA,porary Chairman. Is it a fact that the,50
NA,"person who is reading the ""Tribune"" is",50
NA,reading about this Government's trade,50

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN , -,50
NA,Order!,50
Mr GRIFFITHS ,"I n 1950, the basic",50
NA,"wage was approximately Â£6 2s. a week, or",50
NA,Â£317 a year. So a wage or salary earner,50
NA,who received Â£575 in that year earned,50
NA,"really good money. However, let us deal",50
NA,"with taxation alone, so that we all shall",50
NA,understand the position. Under the,50
NA,"Labour Administration, a married man night",50
NA,with one child to keep paid no tax at all,50
NA,"if he earned only the basic wage, and, in",50
NA,"addition, he and his family received free",50
NA,"hospital treatment, and medical services",50
NA,were provided at minimum cost. The,50
NA,present basic wage in New South Wales,50
NA,"is Â£14 3s. a week, or Â£736 per annum. A some time to-night.",50
NA,worker with a wife and one child to keep,50
NA,who claims on his tax return as deductions,50
NA,"Â£143 for his wife, Â£91 for the child,",50
NA,"for expenditure with a chemist, and Â£20",50
NA,for sundry allowable expenses would be,50
NA,assessed on a taxable income of Â£451. The,50
NA,tax payable last financial year on such,50
NA,taxable income was Â£21 15s. To that,50
NA,amount must be added at least Â£10,50
NA,contributions to hospital and medical,50
NA,fit funds. The arithmetic is simple. Havhonorable,50
NA,ing compared the position of the basic the committee.,50
NA,wage worker with a wife and child to sup-,50

NA,"paid no income tax, with the position of",50
NA,"a similar worker who, under the adminis-",50

NA,Order! There is no point of order in-,50
NA,honvolved. I may say that the Chair is paying,50
NA,attention to what is going on in the com-,50
NA,conmittee. The honorable member for Short-,50
NA,land has been interrupted on a number of,50
NA,"occasions by frivolous points of order, not",50
NA,only from the Government side of the,50
NA,"chamber, but also from the Opposition",50
NA,"side, and his time has now expired.",50
Mr CHANEY ,Perth) [4.23] -A t this,50
NA,time of the year we indulge in a fortnight's,50
NA,with debate on the Budget. On this occasion,50
NA,it was most interesting to hear the,50
NA,Australian Broadcasting Commission's,50
NA,"news service, on the morning after the",50
NA,Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) presented his,50
NA,"Budget, summarize it in four minutes. I",50
NA,suppose in that four minutes the people of,50
NA,Australia learned all they wanted to know,50
NA,"about the 1959-60 Budget, because the",50
NA,news service picked out the highlights of,50
NA,"it, pointing out what you will get and what",50
NA,will be taken from you. Then for a fort-,50
NA,various speakers on both sides of the,50
NA,"House express their views on the Budget,",50
NA,but I venture to suggest that not one of us,50
NA,is naive enough to beUeve that what he says,50
NA,will have any direct bearing on the Budget.,50
NA,I predict that the debate will proceed,50
NA,"according to plan, the vote being taken",50
NA,But I think we have reason to expect,50
NA,Â£20 that the comments made by various,50
NA,speakers will have some influence on the,50
NA,way in which the next Budget is framed.,50
NA,Therefore I wish later to devote myself to,50
NA,a a few matters to which I think the Govern-,50
NA,ment could well give consideration.,50
NA,"in Before doing so, however, I want to",50
NA,benecomment on the speeches of a couple of,50
NA,"members, one from each side of",50
NA,The first speech to which I refer is that,51
NA,"which was made by my colleague, the",51
NA,honorable member for Bowman ( Mr.,51
NA,"MCColm), who spoke last night on the",51
NA,"situation in New Guinea. I think he said,",51
NA,"with a great deal of truth, that he has",51
NA,given much thought to the position in the,51
NA,"Territory of Papua and New Guinea, and",51
NA,"1 am sure that after his visits there, and",51
NA,the time that has elapsed since he returned,51
NA,"from the Territory, he has intensified his",51
NA,study of the situation. Finally he has,51
NA,presented his views to this committee.,51
NA,"With those views I have little quarrel, but",51
NA,I do quarrel with that part of his views,51
NA,that the newspapers saw fit to headline this,51
NA,morning. I refer to the honorable mem-,51
NA,ber's remark that he felt the Minister for,51
NA,Territories ( Mr Hasluck) had outlived his,51
NA,"usefulness. But, in my opinion, the",51
NA,honorable member broke down his own,51
NA,argument when he said that he believed,51
NA,completely in the sincerity of purpose of,51
NA,"Minister, and that few men in Australia",51
NA,have been as sincere or have worked as,51
NA,hard in the interests of the natives of the,51
NA,Territory and of our own aborigines as the,51
NA,Minister. If one passes that kind of judg-,51
NA,"ment on the work of the Minister, one",51
NA,cannot then proceed to a statement that,51
NA,he has outlived his usefulness as Minister,51
NA,for Territories.,51
NA,"If some people in New Guinea, or some",51
NA,"people in Australia, believe that actions",51
NA,taken by a Government-no t by a Minister,51
NA,but by a Government-ar e not in their,51
NA,"interests, or are not in the interests of",51
NA,"the natives, it is quite consistent with our",51
NA,political set-up for them to say so; but,51
NA,"surely, if unpopular moves were the reason",51
NA,"for removing Ministers from their posts,",51
NA,this country would have been without suc-,51
NA,cessive Federal Treasurers since federation.,51
NA,"An unpopular move is, therefore, little",51
NA,"excuse for advocating a Minister's removal,",51
NA,"f do think, on the other hand, that the",51
NA,facts given us by the honorable member,51
NA,for Bowman-th e sincerity of the Minis-,51
NA,"ter, and his interest in the welfare of the",51
NA,native people-ar e fundamental reasons,51
NA,why he should remain in office.,51
NA,This New Guinea question is not one,51
NA,that is confined to the people of Australia.,51
NA,"Indeed, New Guinea is in the spotlight for",51
NA,the whole of the peoples of the Afro-Asian,51
NA,"area, and what Australia does in New",51
NA,Guinea is of vital interest to those peoples,51
NA,in determining their attitude towards us.,51
NA,Their attitude towards us will largely deter-,51
NA,mine whether we will be able to proceed,51
NA,to do what we want to do in New Guinea,51
NA,in the best interests of the indigenous,51
NA,"people of that country. For these reasons,",51
NA,although the Minister may lose the con-,51
NA,in fidence of members of this Parliament and,51
NA,"of some residents of New Guinea, if the",51
NA,Minister and the Government retain the,51
NA,confidence of the people to whom New,51
NA,"Guinea rightly belongs, then I believe that",51
NA,we can go forward in the assumption that,51
NA,we are treading the right path.,51
NA,Now I wish to comment on something,51
NA,that was said during the debate this morn-,51
NA,ning by the honorable member for Braddon,51
NA,"( Mr Davies). He made a statement, per-",51
NA,"haps by mischance, to the effect that the",51
NA,"Tariff Board, in its report on the timber",51
NA,"the industry, had recommended subsidies on",51
NA,freights for Australian timber. That is not,51
NA,quite true.,51
NA,Mr Duthie -I t is pretty nearly right.,51
Mr CHANEY ,I t is not quite true at,51
NA,all. It is entirely at variance with the,51
NA,recommendation that the board did make.,51
NA,The Tariff Board said-,51
NA,Because of the importance which the Board,51
NA,attaches to stability in the timber industry and,51
NA,the importance which freight disadvantages can,51
NA,have upon the return to timber producers in,51
NA,States which have to rely upon sea transport,51
NA,"within the Australian market, the Board feels that",51
NA,the Government's attention should be directed,51
NA,to finding some solution to the problem of freight,51
NA,disadvantage between domestic and imported,51
NA,"timbers. Indeed, the Board believes that one of",51
NA,the major problems of the timber industry in,51
NA,"Tasmama and Western Australia is, in fact, not",51
NA,a problem directly related to this industry so,51
NA,much as to the interstate shipping industry.,51
NA,"The Government, upon receipt of this",51
NA,"report, did pay attention to this problem",51
NA,and appointed an inter-governmental com-,51
NA,"very mittee to investigate it. From memory, I",51
NA,tthink that the committee did not recom-,51
NA,mend that a subsidy be paid on interstate,51
NA,"freights, because that is not a solution to",51
NA,the problem. At the time there was ship-,51
NA,"ping lying idle in overseas ports, and it was",51
NA,safe to assume that there would be a further,51
NA,"reduction in overseas freights, while Aus-",51
NA,tralian freight rates would continue to rise.,51
NA,"So a subsidy, although it might have offered",51
NA,"immediate relief, would not have provided",51
NA,"much in the way of any long-term relief,",52
NA,and there was a necessity for the industry,52
NA,itself to look for ways and means to cut,52
NA,"its costs, to improve handling conditions",52
NA,and to solve some of its other problems-,52
NA,which it has done.,52
NA,"I do believe, however, that the Govern-",52
NA,ment can give assistance to the timber,52
NA,"industry in South Austraha, in Tasmania",52
NA,"particularly, and in Western Australia. I",52
NA,feel that the Government is obliged to do,52
NA,so because of the dimculty the industry,52
NA,faces continually in the timber areas that,52
NA,we have in Australia. As your centres of,52
NA,production move further from your sea,52
NA,"ports, when new cutting areas are opened",52
NA,"up, you get an increase in costs. In placing",52
NA,"timber on markets throughout Australia,",52
NA,the industry is constantly facing this,52
NA,problem of an increasing cost structure.,52
NA,At the present time Western Australia,52
NA,can produce far more timber than it can,52
NA,"sell, either in the State itself or in the",52
NA,eastern States. Although the Government,52
NA,has said that it does not use import conlished,52
NA,"trols to bolster up any Australian industry,",52
NA,I believe that this is one instance in which,52
NA,it would well do so. Souih Australia is,52
NA,importing vast quantities of oregon timber,52
NA,"from America. This, of course, costs us",52
NA,dollars. Several honorable members from,52
NA,Western Australia have spoken on this,52
NA,matter in this chamber on previous occawho,52
NA,sions. At the same time as South,52
NA,"is importing timber from America, there",52
NA,are available in Western Australia ample,52
NA,supplies of timber for the South Australian,52
NA,"building industry, which has been found",52
NA,satisfactory by the South Australian,52
NA,"builders. As a matter of fact, some of",52
NA,"them, such as the State housing authority,",52
NA,specify that Western Australian timber,52
NA,should be used in their buildings.,52
NA,If one turns to the section of the Budget,52
NA,"speech concerned with mining industries,",52
NA,one finds this-,52
NA,Proposals will be brought forward to liberalize,52
NA,under certain circumstances the depreciation,52
NA,visions relating to various categories of expendi-,52
NA,ture by mining concerns on housing and certain,52
NA,other amenities. The annual cost to revenue,52
NA,"estimated at Â£250,000 including 1959-60.",52
NA,Because the Government recognizes the,52
NA,importance of mining in the earning of,52
NA,"overseas funds, it is taking certain steps",52
NA,develop mining undertakings throughout,52
NA,Australia. It is also legislating to give,52
NA,"assistance in the search for oil, because of",52
NA,the importance of this commodity with,52
NA,relation to our overseas balances. I think,52
NA,"the Government has a duty also, not only",52
NA,to those industries that it wants to start up,52
NA,"and induce to grow, but also to the older-",52
NA,established industries such as the timber,52
NA,industry. If we can apply these deprecia-,52
NA,tion concessions to the mining industry in,52
NA,"an endeavour to help it solve its problems,",52
NA,then surely we can meet the requests of,52
NA,the timber industry to have the same con-,52
NA,cessions applied in that case.,52
NA,For years past the timber industry has,52
NA,been urging the Government to take into,52
NA,"consideration expenditure on mill buildings,",52
NA,"housing, &c, with regard to this matter of",52
NA,depreciation. When you move your mill,52
NA,centre to a new area of production you,52
NA,"have this problem of building, and I",52
NA,believe the Government could well con-,52
NA,sider applying to the timber industry also,52
NA,the depreciation system that it has estab-,52
NA,for the benefit of the mining industry.,52
NA,"By doing so, it would help to lower the",52
NA,cost structure to a certain extent. This,52
NA,would enable the timber industry to survive,52
NA,and to continue to provide employment for,52
NA,"numbers of Australians who, in many cases,",52
NA,have been brought up in the timber indus-,52
NA,"try, who know no other occupation and",52
NA,would be lost souls if they lost their,52
NA,Australia employment in that industry.,52
NA,The other point that I want to touch on,52
NA,concerns social services. I know that,52
NA,Opposition supporters have raised strong,52
NA,objections to the static position of child,52
NA,endowment payments. I agree with them,52
NA,to the extent that I think the Government,52
NA,should give serious consideration to some,52
NA,action in connexion with child endowment,52
NA,payments. If it cannot grant a flat rate of,52
NA,"increase applying to every child, then it",52
NA,should adopt some method of easing the,52
NA,burden on the middle income group parti-,52
NA,"procularly, and on those with large families.",52
NA,I notice that the Minister for Supply ( Mr.,52
NA,"is Hulme), in his Budget speech the other",52
NA,"night, in reply to the Leader of the Oppo-",52
NA,"sition (Dr Evatt), stated that this Govern-",52
NA,ment had done many things which could be,52
NA,to considered as alternative to an increase in,52
NA,the child endowment payments.,52
NA,Mr KilleD -Ho w many children have,53
NA,you?,53
Mr CHANEY ,"O n the last count, Mr.",53
NA,"Acting Chairman, seven. I was speaking",53
NA,about the middle income group. Having,53
NA,read the newspaper statements following the,53
NA,"Richardson report, I can hardly believe that",53
NA,I am in the middle income group; after,53
NA,reading those newspapers 1 believe that I,53
NA,"am in the millionaire group, so what I am",53
NA,saying to the honorable member for,53
NA,Moreton does not apply in my case.,53
NA,The Minister for Supply said that this,53
NA,Government had introduced a medical,53
NA,"benefits scheme, a pharmaceutical benefits",53
NA,"scheme, free milk for school children,",53
NA,"poliomyelitis vaccine free of charge, tax",53
NA,"concessions for educational expenses, the",53
NA,"Commonwealth scholarships scheme, about",53
NA,"which 1 shall comment later, and increased",53
NA,tax concessions in respect of dependants.,53
NA,"That is very true, and I suppose that the",53
NA,average family has benefited considerably.,53
NA,But it still does not get away from the,53
NA,fact that when a child who is still attending,53
NA,a school or a university reaches sixteen,53
NA,"years of age, the family suffers because",53
NA,child endowment for that child ceases. It,53
NA,also suffers in another way. The amount,53
NA,"lost is not 5s., which is die payment for",53
NA,"the first child, but 10s., which is the pay-",53
NA,"ment for the second child, because the",53
NA,second child then becomes the first child,53
NA,for the purposes of endowment. The Go-,53
NA,vernment could well give consideration to,53
NA,the payment of child endowment up to,53
NA,a later age for the child who remains at,53
NA,"school or proceeds to university, because",53
NA,that is fhe period when the family feels the,53
NA,difficulty of financing schooling for their,53
NA,children.,53
NA,I disagree with the honorable member,53
NA,for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti) who stated,53
NA,that all over the country brilliant children,53
NA,were leaving school at an early age to,53
NA,supplement the family income. That to,53
NA,me is a rather derogatory statement to,53
NA,make about parents in the middle and,53
NA,"lower income groups, many of whom keep",53
NA,their children at school and at university,53
NA,at great sacrifice to themselves. There are,53
NA,very few instances where a brilliant child,53
NA,leaves school to supplement the family in-,53
NA,come and if we look back over the history,53
NA,of brilliant children who have left school,53
NA,"at fourteen or fifteen years of age, we",53
NA,find them in commerce or industry or,53
NA,somewhere else holding leading positions in,53
NA,whatever field they have chosen; their,53
NA,ability has shown itself and they have come,53
NA,to the top.,53
NA,NA,53
NA,have been if they had had the additional,53
NA,"opportunity, though!",53
Mr CHANEY ,Sometime s when I,53
NA,look around this chamber I doubt whether,53
NA,the opportunities that have been given to,53
NA,some have been properly grasped and used,53
NA,to advantage.,53
NA,"As the Minister for Supply mentioned,",53
NA,the Government introduced a Common-,53
NA,wealth scholarship scheme. However good,53
NA,"it may be, I believe that it can be con-",53
NA,"siderably improved. First, the interpreta-",53
NA,tion of the living allowance is quite wrong.,53
NA,A living allowance should be paid on the,53
NA,"net income and not on the gross income,",53
NA,because very few people qualify for it,53
NA,after the means test has been applied.,53
NA,"Further, if a child is brilliant enough to",53
NA,"win a scholarship, the value of the scholar-",53
NA,ship becomes part of the father's taxable,53
NA,income. It puts the father into a higher,53
NA,income tax group. Any one who wins a,53
NA,"motor car on a quiz show, a lottery or a",53
NA,prize as a beauty contestant is not required,53
NA,to add the value of the prize to the taxable,53
NA,"income. What we are doing, in effect, is",53
NA,taxing the brain power of our citizens at a,53
NA,time when this brain power should be used,53
NA,to the greatest advantage. I suggest that,53
NA,the Government give serious consideration,53
NA,"to this problem, because, in all instances,",53
NA,"regardless of the income of the parents,",53
NA,education to university level these days is a,53
NA,severe drain on whatever resources they,53
NA,have.,53
NA,The third matter in the field of social,53
NA,services that I would advocate is that the,53
NA,"Government institute, along the lines of",53
NA,"the medical health scheme, a dental care",53
NA,scheme. Dentists' bills to-day are the,53
NA,greatest bugbear of Australian families.,53
NA,Many children now visit a dentist not to,53
NA,"get their teeth put in a sound state, but",53
NA,to have dental treatment to the amount,53
NA,that the parents can afford to pay. Some,53
NA,scheme should be introduced so that the,53
NA,"parents of children up to a certain age,",53
NA,perhaps seven or eight years or a litde,53
NA,"older, could receive some assistance to",53
NA,will ensure that their children enjoy sound,53
NA,"dental health. To-day, dentists themselves",54
NA,admit that the simplest treatment is being,54
NA,priced beyond the means of the average,54
NA,parent.,54
NA,The last matter on which I want to,54
NA,comment is a matter that has received a,54
NA,great deal of attention during the Budget,54
NA,"debate. There is some dangerous talk, par-",54
NA,"ticularly from Opposition members, about",54
NA,overseas investments in this country. The,54
NA,honorable member for MCPherson ( Mr.,54
NA,Barnes) yesterday gave a very clear,54
NA,account of the activities of General,54
NA,Motors-Holden's Limited in Australia.,54
NA,He mentioned what Australia owed,54
NA,to the company and what the com-,54
NA,pany had ploughed back into the nation's,54
NA,"economy. Therefore, I do not want to",54
NA,"deal with that point. However, I think",54
NA,that honorable members should be,54
NA,extremely careful lest they do the very,54
NA,thing that can sound the death knell of,54
NA,"development in Australia, by frightening",54
NA,people away from investment within this,54
NA,country. I shall illustrate how simply this,54
NA,can be done. Some two or three years,54
NA,"ago, the Western Australian Government",54
NA,passed a simple act on unfair trading. I,54
NA,know as an absolute fact that firms that,54
NA,had decided to go to Western Australia to,54
NA,establish businesses did not do so because,54
NA,of the operation of this legislation.,54
NA,NA,54
Mr CHANEY ,Th e honorable mema position,54
NA,ber for Lalor said that they wanted to,54
NA,unfair. That is as far removed from the,54
NA,truth as anything could be. What they,54
NA,wanted was to be in a position to gamble,54
NA,their investment but not to be penalized if,54
NA,the investment were a success. They were,54
NA,not willing to invest in the State that was,54
NA,placing a curb on the progress of their,54
NA,business interests. The moment that impedi-,54
NA,"ment is removed, I feel sure that establish-",54
NA,ments in the eastern States will begin to puzzled,54
NA,develop their enterprises in Western Aushigh.,54
NA,tralia.,54
NA,Honorable members opposite would do,54
NA,well to get a copy of a speech made by the,54
NA,"Honorable William Sebald, the American",54
NA,"Ambassador to Australia, to the Sydney",54
NA,"Rotary Club on 9th June, at a time when investment of British capital.",54
NA,there was much criticism in the Australian,54
NA,press from would-be influential people about,54
NA,the success of General Motors-Holden's,54
NA,Limited. That particular aspect was not,54
NA,"mentioned in the speech, but I think the",54
NA,aim was to stop some of this nonsensical,54
NA,thinking about profits. When we are hear-,54
NA,ing so many tales of gloom about the Aus-,54
NA,"tralian economy, it is refreshing to hear a",54
NA,man like the American Ambassador praise,54
NA,the state of the Australian economy in the,54
NA,way that he did in this speech. I shall,54
NA,"quote at some length from it, although if",54
NA,this were the American House of Repre-,54
NA,sentatives I could now request that the whole,54
NA,"of the speech be incorporated in "" Hansard """,54
NA,and I would be saved the necessity of read-,54
NA,ing it. I cannot read it in full but I shall try,54
NA,to string the pieces together. He said-,54
NA,During the past year and a half we have had,54
NA,an extraordinary demonstration of the strength,54
NA,of the Australian economy in the face of a,54
NA,"world-wide recession and of a continuation, for",54
NA,"the second consecutive year, of the lowest level",54
NA,of Australian farm incomes for a decade. In-,54
NA,come from wool exports have been down by over,54
NA,"40 per cent. Yet, in spite of this, national income",54
NA,has not declined significantly. The period has,54
NA,thus shown that Australia has become less depen-,54
NA,"dent on primary industry, and particularly on",54
NA,"wool, for its short-run prosperity.",54
NA,For the benefit of those who may think that,54
NA,Mr Sebald was decrying the development,54
NA,"of the wool industry in Australia, I point",54
NA,out that he went on to clarify the statement.,54
NA,Later in the speech he said-,54
NA,"The investors of the world, I think, are now",54
NA,becoming aware of Australia's rich resources and,54
NA,of the stability of its institutions and strength of,54
NA,"its economy. This being so, Australia has, through",54
NA,"its own efforts, reached a most enviable position-",54
NA,which many other less fortunate nations,54
NA,be would go to great lengths to achieve.,54
NA,"So the speech proceeded, praising the Aus-",54
NA,tralian economy which was so attractive to,54
NA,"overseas investors and proving that, regard-",54
NA,less of what was taken out after these in-,54
NA,"vestments had been made, they added to the",54
NA,general wealth of the country because of the,54
NA,attraction of other investments. He said-,54
NA,It is for this reason that I was somewhat,54
NA,by recent comments which suggested that,54
NA,the price paid for foreign investment was too,54
NA,It was interesting to be told that the develop-,54
NA,ment of America in the early days of its,54
NA,history was achieved entirely by the invest-,54
NA,ment of overseas capital. The American,54
NA,railroad system was built in the main by the,54
NA,Queen,54
NA,Victoria was the largest shareholder in one,54
NA,particular American railroad. From that,54
NA,"example, the Americans point to the Aus-",54
NA,tralian scene and say that since Australia,54
NA,has reached a stage of development com-,55
NA,"parable with that in America at that time,",55
NA,the attraction of overseas capital can help,55
NA,us to develop at much the same rate as,55
NA,America did in those early years. It is,55
NA,interesting to note the amount of non-,55
NA,American capital-no t necessarily British-,55
NA,invested in the United States at that period.,55
NA,From 1843 to 1919 America was a net,55
NA,debtor. In 1919 she became a net credi-,55
NA,tor because during World War I . most of,55
NA,the British investments in America had to,55
NA,be sold so that Great Britain could buy,55
NA,equipment needed to fight the war. In,55
NA,1843 the amount of foreign capital invested,55
NA,in the United States amounted to,55
NA,"200,000,000 dollars. By 1869 the amount",55
NA,"had risen to 1,460,000,000 dollars; in 1897",55
NA,"it was 2,710,000,000, and in 1908, it was",55
NA,"3,900,000,000 dollars. To show what was",55
NA,"happening in the country, American",55
NA,national wealth in 1843 stood at,55
NA,"5,700,000,000 dollars, in 1869 at",55
NA,"25,200,000,000 dollars, in 1900 at",55
NA,"88,500,000,000 dollars and in 1912 at",55
NA,"186,300,000,000 dollars. America has",55
NA,progressed at an amazing rate over the last,55
NA,two centuries and its example clearly shows,55
NA,that overseas investment in Australia can,55
NA,only serve the best interests of our nation.,55
NA,When dividends from overseas invest-,55
NA,ments are paid to shareholders outside Aus-,55
NA,"tralia, some people think that Australia's",55
NA,"resources are being drained away. But, in",55
NA,"fact, investments of that kind are opening",55
NA,up further channels of investment and in-,55
NA,creasing the reservoir of our national,55
NA,wealth. Critics of undertakings like General,55
NA,Motors-Holden's Limited should bear in,55
NA,mind the fact that all American investments,55
NA,in this country have not met with such,55
NA,success. For example millions of pounds,55
NA,have been invested in oil search in Australia,55
NA,with absolutely no return to the investors,55
NA,and the possibility is that there never will,55
NA,be a return.,55
NA,Mr Jones -Wha t about the profit from,55
NA,oil sales?,55
Mr CHANEY ,Th e other night 1,55
NA,heard some criticism about the establish-,55
NA,ment of oil refineries in Australia. It was,55
NA,said that the wicked oil people came here,55
NA,and built a tremendous refinery which can,55
NA,be operated by only twenty men. The,55
NA,charge was that this concern caused unem-,55
NA,ployment. What a magnificent argument.,55
NA,There were no workers employed there,55
NA,"before this refinery was built, but now",55
NA,twenty are fully employed. Because oil,55
NA,refineries have been built and oil refined,55
NA,"here, Australia has been saved about",55
NA,"Â£30,000,000 in foreign exchange during",55
NA,the last five or six years.,55
NA,NA,55
NA,were established in States when Labour,55
NA,governments were in office.,55
Mr CHANEY , I come from Western,55
NA,Austraha. I will not refer to what has,55
NA,happened in Victoria. In Western Aus-,55
NA,tralia the refinery was established during,55
NA,the regime of the MCLarty-Watts non-,55
NA,Labour Government. Originally the Com-,55
NA,monwealth Oil Refining Company Limited,55
NA,intended to build its refinery in Victoria.,55
NA,That is a complete answer to the honorable,55
NA,member's suggestion that these establish-,55
NA,ments were built only in States in which,55
NA,Labour governments were in office.,55
NA,"Lastly, I shall refer briefly to the state",55
NA,of Western Australia's economy. The,55
NA,Government of that State is making valiant,55
NA,efforts to bring Western Australia's pro-,55
NA,gress and development somewhat into line,55
NA,with that in the eastern States. It faces a,55
NA,mammoth task. Honorable members,55
NA,opposite criticize overseas investments and,55
NA,complain about the profit made by General,55
NA,Motors-Holdens' Limited or by Broken,55
NA,Hill Proprietary Company Limited. My,55
NA,reply to their criticism is that if New South,55
NA,Wales or Victoria object to the investment,55
NA,"of overseas capital in their States, Western",55
NA,Australia will welcome such investment,55
NA,with open arms. Industries may come,55
NA,there and establish their factories and pro-,55
NA,"gress to their heart's content, because we",55
NA,realize that this would improve the,55
NA,economy of our State and provide employ-,55
NA,ment for the thousands we want to see,55
NA,employed in Western Australia.,55
Mr CLARK ,Darling) [4.50] - I wish to,55
NA,deal with some of the items which were,55
NA,"covered by the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt),",55
NA,in his Budget speech. Previous speakers,55
NA,have dealt with many of its points and have,55
NA,shown that this Budget is designed to assist,55
NA,those in the community who are better off,55
NA,but gives little aid to those in greatest need.,55
NA,One of the first matters to which the Trea-,56
NA,"surer referred was employment, and he",56
NA,said-,56
NA,Of the additional people available for employ-,56
NA,"ment, most if not all found occupations.",56
NA,"He went on to deal with overseas reserves,",56
NA,and said-,56
NA,"Externally, our position improved as the year",56
NA,went on and instead of our overseas reserves fall-,56
NA,"ing by something over Â£100,000,000 as had been",56
NA,"feared when the year began, they fell by only",56
NA,"Â£10,000,000. . . . This came about partly",56
NA,through a strong inflow of private capital com-,56
NA,bined with some success in public borrowing,56
NA,"abroad, and partly through a recovery in exports.",56
NA,He further pointed out that the ceiling for,56
NA,import licensing was being raised from,56
NA,"Â£800,000,000 a year to Â£850,000,000 and",56
NA,added-,56
NA,These are the essential facts of a successful,56
NA,Any business man who balanced his trad-,56
NA,ing budget only by borrowing from his,56
NA,friends would not be regarded as being,56
NA,very successful. Most people would conand,56
NA,sider that the business was in a very,56
NA,way. I f a business cannot show adequate,56
NA,"profits in its trading activities it is concountries,",56
NA,sidered to be very unsatisfactory. National,56
NA,finances can only be considered in the,56
NA,light as we view a private business. I draw,56
NA,attention to a further statement in the,56
NA,get speech which reads-,56
NA,In net terms the addition to the work force,56
NA,"year will probably be about 80,000.",56
NA,"That is a very significant figure, and",56
NA,been frequently cited in this debate. The,56
NA,Treasurer also said-,56
NA,"To keep all resources, and particularly",56
NA,"resources of labour, fully employed is, of",56
NA,not only a social obUgation but also a vital,56
NA,nomic need.,56
NA,One would think that if the Treasurer felt,56
NA,"it was a vital social and economic obligaindustries,",56
NA,tion to keep our labour force fully env,56
NA,"ployed, he would do more about the matter",56
NA,than is being done at the present time. For,56
NA,quite a considerable time in Australia,56
NA,number of unemployed has stood at,56
NA,"60,000, which is a very substantial number",56
NA,"indeed. In the year 1957-58, about",56
NA,"Â£2,000,000 was paid out in unemployment",56
NA,"benefit, but in the year 1958-59, payments",56
NA,"under that head amounted to Â£4,900,000,",56
NA,which was more than double the figure for,56
NA,the preceding year. The Treasurer stated,56
NA,"that about 80,000 persons had become control",56
NA,available for employment this year. Last remittances.,56
NA,year the estimate was about the same num-,56
NA,ber. It would be interesting to know,56
NA,whether these people actually found em-,56
NA,ployment. I know that in my electorate,56
NA,"this year, many children who were old",56
NA,"enough to leave school, returned there",56
NA,because they could not find employment.,56
NA,That is one of the very serious aspects of,56
NA,unemployment to-day. The figures avail-,56
NA,able for last year show that the total,56
NA,"number of persons employed in Australia,",56
NA,apart from those engaged in the defence,56
NA,"forces, increased by 22,000. Of that num-",56
NA,ber 16.000 became engaged in Government,56
NA,"activities, so only 6,000 persons commenced",56
NA,employment with private organizations. It,56
NA,"is rather startling to learn that of 80,000",56
NA,persons who became available for employ-,56
NA,"ment, only 22,000 obtained employment,",56
NA,"year. and of that number 16,000 were absorbed",56
NA,in the Public Service.,56
NA,A budget should contain a definite policy,56
NA,a programme designed to expand the,56
NA,bad country's production. We have read of,56
NA,five-year plans and seven-year plans in other,56
NA,but in Australia we have no speci-,56
NA,fic programme. We should set a target for,56
NA,"same primary production, and the Government",56
NA,should give substantial assistance to primary,56
NA,Budproducers to enable them to reach that,56
NA,target. But the Government leaves every-,56
NA,this thing to the producers. A similar target,56
NA,"should be set for the heavy industries, which",56
NA,it has produce our consumer goods. We have,56
NA,been told that our population will increase,56
NA,"substantially during the next ten years, and",56
NA,our that the demand for goods will rise corre-,56
NA,"course,, spondingly. The Government should do",56
NA,ecomore to assist private enterprise in its,56
NA,efforts to expand our economy. It could do,56
NA,this by assisting in the establishment of new,56
NA,and by protecting those that,56
NA,already have been established. The Minis-,56
NA,ter for Trade ( Mr MCEwen) has stated that,56
NA,an increase in our export income is depen-,56
NA,"the dent on producers, manufacturers and ex-",56
NA,"porters, and not on the Government. The",56
NA,"leading article in the "" Sydney Morning",56
NA,"Herald"" of l l t h August dealt with the",56
NA,Minister's statement in these terms-,56
NA,Some good progress should undoubtedly be,56
NA,aimed for in the exports drive from now on. The,56
NA,great capital inflow . . . . lies beyond our,56
NA,and will in due course carry servicing,56
NA,obligations in the form of dividend and interest,56
NA,The honorable member for Perth ( Mr.,57
NA,Chaney) has referred to the benefits to be,57
NA,derived from the investment of foreign,57
NA,capital in Australia. Although I do not,57
NA,oppose the establishment of foreign enter-,57
NA,"prises, or the investment of foreign capital,",57
NA,"in this country, there should be a percentage",57
NA,of Australian holdings in all companies so,57
NA,established. Those companies should have,57
NA,the right to export their production to any,57
NA,"part of the world. However, in Australia",57
NA,we have companies wholly owned by over-,57
NA,seas organizations which exploit this coun-,57
NA,"try, obtain huge profits and then take out",57
NA,of Australia a great proportion of those,57
NA,profits. The much maligned General,57
NA,Motors-Holden's Limited raised its capital,57
NA,in Australia. That company advertises every,57
NA,day for debenture capital to finance its,57
NA,"operations, offering to pay 6 i per cent,",57
NA,interest on a long-term loan although it,57
NA,"is making many hundreds per cent, in",57
NA,profits. G.M.H. is not an example of,57
NA,foreign capital investment; it is an example,57
NA,of foreign interests exploiting Australian,57
NA,capital. Only by expanding the home,57
NA,markets for our produce can we obtain a,57
NA,turnover in goods to enable us to build up a,57
NA,sound export market. If we have a substan-,57
NA,tial home market which is protected to the,57
NA,extent that our industries are able to,57
NA,"develop on sound economic lines, use more",57
NA,efficient methods of production and diminish,57
NA,"costs, those industries will be in a better",57
NA,position to go on the export market. But,57
NA,the Government has not helped our pro-,57
NA,"ducers, because during the ten years it has",57
NA,been in office the march of inflation has,57
NA,"been unchecked, and the cost structure has",57
NA,become a heavier burden on our industries.,57
NA,I have been rather alarmed to learn that,57
NA,"the Minister for Trade, a member of the",57
NA,"Australian Country Party, has initiated",57
NA,quiries before the Tariff Board into about,57
NA,300 items on the most-favoured-nation,57
NA,schedule designed to lower the rate of duty,57
NA,on a comprehensive range of goods imported,57
NA,from foreign countries. I have taken the,57
NA,opportunity to examine all those,57
NA,have found that the proposed reductions,57
NA,of duty will be very substantial in many,57
NA,instances and will be disastrous to the,57
NA,establishment of new industries and to the protection.,57
NA,security and development of those already,57
NA,established. Advertisements have appeared,57
NA,in Sydney newspapers to the effect,57
NA,Tariff Board inquiries will commence on,57
NA,"20th July into 164 items, and on 6th",57
NA,October into a further 106 items. Unfor-,57
NA,"tunately, the Tariff Board must complete",57
NA,its inquiries within a specified time so it,57
NA,does not have the opportunity to inquire,57
NA,carefully into all of the 300 items on the,57
NA,schedule. I shall refer to only a few of,57
NA,the items on the schedule. The duty of,57
NA,"47i per cent., plus 10 per cent, primage,",57
NA,"on screws, bolts, nuts, rivets and metal",57
NA,washers will be reduced to 17i per cent.;,57
NA,"the duty of 22i per cent., plus 10 per cent,",57
NA,"primage, on screw hooks, eyes and rings",57
NA,will be reduced to 7 i per cent.; the duty,57
NA,"of 45 per cent, on transmitters will be re-",57
NA,duced to 30 per cent.; the duty of 45 per,57
NA,"cent, on electrical machines and appliances",57
NA,will be reduced to 30 per cent.; and the,57
NA,"duty of 22i per cent., plus 10 per cent,",57
NA,"primage, on certain electrical household",57
NA,equipment will be reduced to 7 i per cent.,57
NA,Industries producing the goods to which,57
NA,I have referred are already established in,57
NA,"Australia, and I am sure that the proposed",57
NA,reductions will make it more difficult for,57
NA,them to carry on. Instead of trying to,57
NA,"build up home markets for our production,",57
NA,the Government seems to be trying to,57
NA,"wreck established industries. Unfortunately,",57
NA,many Australian Country Party members,57
NA,"are one-eyed, and cannot see what the",57
NA,Government is doing.,57
NA,Let me refer now to textiles. The duty of,57
NA,"22i per cent, on blankets, which are manu-",57
NA,"factured on a large scale in Australia, will",57
NA,be reduced to 12i per cent. A similar,57
NA,reduction will be made in the case of quilts.,57
NA,The examples that I have given to the com-,57
NA,mittee indicate the substantial reductions of,57
NA,duty that the Government suggests should,57
NA,be made in order to encourage other coun-,57
NA,"tries to purchase our primary products,",57
NA,inbut it is doing this at the expense of our,57
NA,secondary industries. Such a policy is,57
NA,"disastrous. Indeed, Mr G. R. Bain, the",57
NA,tariff officer for the Associated Chambers,57
NA,"of Manufactures of Australia, made a very",57
NA,strong comment about the attitude of the,57
NA,"items, and Government. He said-",57
NA,If Ausbralian industry is to grow and to make,57
NA,"a greater contribution to national development,",57
NA,it must have tariff rates which will give real,57
NA,Labour will never agree to substantial tariff,57
NA,reductions. We have always regarded the,57
NA,that home market as a sound one for our,57
NA,"primary products, and the establishment",58
NA,and fostering of secondary industry as,58
NA,essential to our national well-being.,58
NA,Under the Scullin Government Labour,58
NA,"did much to establish industries, and",58
NA,any reduction of tariff rates would be a,58
NA,backward step. The current Tariff Board,58
NA,inquiries were initiated as a result of,58
NA,tralian Country Party pressure within the,58
NA,Cabinet. That party has always been pre-,58
NA,"judiced against, if not opposed to, the",58
NA,establishment of secondary industry. It,58
NA,"has been reactionary, and has never realized",58
NA,that its best customer was the home cus-,58
NA,tomer. It is significant that the Minister,58
NA,for Trade is a member of the Australian,58
NA,Country Party and that the chairman of,58
NA,"the Tariff Board, Dr Westerman, com-",58
NA,menced his service with the Department,58
NA,of Commerce and Agriculture. Another,58
NA,"member is Mr Boyer, the son of a mem-",58
NA,"ber of the party, who is well known in",58
NA,the broadcasting world. Labour believes,58
NA,that at least half of the members of the,58
NA,Tariff Board should be men with a vast,58
NA,experience of manufacturing industry.,58
NA,Such men would be in the best position to,58
NA,review the tariff schedules. It would be,58
NA,fallacious to suggest that any lowering of,58
NA,the most-favoured-nation tariff would,58
NA,"Australia. On the contrary, such action",58
NA,would harm this country. In my 25 years,58
NA,of parliamentary life I cannot recall a,58
NA,previous occasion when the Tariff Board,58
NA,has been directed to inquire whether a,58
NA,wide range of duties could be substantially,58
NA,"reduced-obviously , in order to benefit",58
NA,foreign industries and embarrass local,58
NA,manufacturers. The proposals are fantas-,58
NA,"tic, especially as they are made at a time",58
NA,"when, on the one hand, Australia is",58
NA,"experiencing unemployment, and, on the",58
NA,"other, secondary industry is expected to",58
NA,provide work for thousands of new Aus-,58
NA,tralians brought in under our immigration,58
NA,"scheme. Recently, certain tariff rates",58
NA,designed for the protection of Australian,58
NA,"industry have been reduced, though",58
NA,increases in the rates had been sought. I,58
NA,"have in mind certain rubber goods, textiles",58
NA,and wheeled tractors. The Government also,58
NA,refused to give protection to woollen piece,58
NA,goods in the way recommended by the,58
NA,Tariff Board. All this is indicative of a,58
NA,"move to break down tariff protection and,",58
NA,"in that way, substantially injure the",58
NA,secondary industries.,58
NA,Mr Duthie -Wh o is inspiring it?,58
Mr CLARK ,I t is inspired by the Aus-,58
NA,tralian Country Party. Recent events in,58
NA,connexion with Tariff Board recommenda-,58
NA,tions leave no doubt in our minds that,58
NA,that party is prepared to sacrifice our,58
NA,"secondary industries, and remain blind to",58
NA,Austhe advantages of the secure home market,58
NA,that they provide.,58
NA,I shall not labour the point further,58
NA,except to emphasize that our tariff system,58
NA,is in great danger as a result of the inquiry,58
NA,which is now taking place. I hope that,58
NA,the board will not be stampeded by the,58
NA,Government into reducing tariffs in the,58
NA,way I have described. That would sound,58
NA,the death knell for many great Australian,58
NA,"industries, and would add to the ranks of",58
NA,the unemployed.,58
NA,The honorable member for Perth ( Mr.,58
NA,Chaney) referred to the inflow of capital,58
NA,from overseas. I believe that we should,58
NA,borrow in order to finance the business of,58
NA,"this country, but that loans should be raised",58
NA,within Australia. It is fallacious to borrow,58
NA,"Â£20,000,000 abroad in order to implement",58
NA,the Mount Isa to Townsville railway,58
NA,"assist scheme when the whole of the labour,",58
NA,material and resources required for the,58
NA,project are obtainable in Australia. We,58
NA,can only be excused for borrowing over-,58
NA,seas when we are short of dollars or sterl-,58
NA,ing with which to purchase essentia] re-,58
NA,quirements. We have substantial sterling,58
NA,balances and should be able to buy what,58
NA,"we need from Britain. If we do that, the",58
NA,resultant production will swell our export,58
NA,income and help our trade balance. It is,58
NA,humiliating for Australia that her Prime,58
NA,Minister ( Mr Menzies) should be a party,58
NA,to bowing and scraping before the Ameri-,58
NA,can people so that Australia can obtain a,58
NA,"miserable Â£20,000,000. To-day, when",58
NA,hundreds of millions are spent annually,58
NA,"by governments, Â£20,000,000 is a small",58
NA,sum indeed. It could be advanced by the,58
NA,Commonwealth Bank under the guarantee,58
NA,of this Government. That is a simple,58
NA,banking process which we see put into,58
NA,effect frequently. If an individual wants,58
NA,an overdraft to help him carry out some,58
NA,business enterprise he obtains the help of,58
NA,a guarantor of more substantial means and,58
NA,is then entitled to write cheques up to a,58
NA,specified limit. If the banks-an d particu-,59
NA,larly the Commonwealth Bank-ca n do,59
NA,"this for an individual, how much more can",59
NA,"be done for a State, which is backed",59
NA,by all the security which the nation can,59
NA,provide? As long as the nation is sound,59
NA,"the security will hold good, and if the",59
NA,nation fails all else is lost. I was rather,59
NA,pleased that the loan for the Mount Isa,59
NA,railway project was turned down. I am,59
NA,"hopeful that better counsels will prevail,",59
NA,that the money will be advanced by the,59
NA,Commonwealth Bank and that this Govern-,59
NA,ment will guarantee its repayment.,59
NA,Our essential industries should be,59
NA,developed with local capital. People should,59
NA,be encouraged to invest the substantial,59
NA,savings at present lying in the savings,59
NA,banks. The return to the individual would,59
NA,be much greater if the Commonwealth,59
NA,were to use its own resources to finance its,59
NA,"works, and public savings were invested in",59
NA,secondary industry. We should be a more,59
NA,prosperous country and every one would,59
NA,benefit.,59
NA,Another matter with which I should like,59
NA,to deal in the few minutes at my disposal,59
NA,is the intention of the Government to in-,59
NA,crease the charges for telephone calls and,59
NA,"the postage of letters, periodicals and so",59
NA,on. This proposal must have been very,59
NA,little understood by Government suppor-,59
NA,"ters, lt is rather significant that an Aus-",59
NA,tralian Country Party member is respon-,59
NA,sible for that proposal. I have been re-,59
NA,liably informed that the officers of the,59
NA,Postal Department were entirely opposed,59
NA,to the suggested increases and that the new,59
NA,rates were adopted without their approval,59
NA,or recommendation. Who else could have,59
NA,done it but the Minister in charge of the,59
NA,"department, in collaboration with the",59
NA,Treasurer? And to-day he is trying to get,59
NA,out from under by introducing a charge,59
NA,which is opposed by the omcers of his,59
NA,own department as being most unjust and,59
NA,inequitable! The Country Party must bear,59
NA,the full brunt of responsibility for these,59
NA,creased charges which will bear so heavily,59
NA,"upon the country people, because they make",59
NA,great use of post and telephone facilities.,59
NA,"The cost of newspapers, periodicals and",59
NA,so on must increase as the result of these,59
NA,higher rates and all this will add to the,59
NA,already high costs being borne by the com-,59
NA,"munity. Costs have gone up in many ways,",59
NA,yet the Government proposes to double cer-,59
NA,tain postal charges.,59
NA,The Prime Minister admits that he knows,59
NA,nothing about the matter. This is not the,59
NA,first occasion on which I have found that,59
NA,he does not know what is going on. He,59
NA,travels around the world so much that he,59
NA,"gets out of touch with things here, and",59
NA,knows very little about what is going on,59
NA,at home. The price of wool has been down,59
NA,"for over twelve months now, and the Go-",59
NA,vernment takes great credit to itself for the,59
NA,"recent increase, but I point out that twelve",59
NA,months ago I asked the Prime Minister why,59
NA,interest rates had been increased for money,59
NA,for the purchase of wool. I pointed out,59
NA,that this increase would be responsible for,59
NA,reducing the price of wool. The Prime,59
NA,Minister informed me that he had no,59
NA,knowledge of the matter other than what,59
NA,I had said to him. On the next sitting day,59
NA,I brought to the chamber the actual docu-,59
NA,ment furnished by the woolbuyers' banks,59
NA,in which it was stated that the interest,59
NA,"rates would be increased as from, I think",59
NA,"it was, 4th October. I asked the same",59
NA,"question again, having the document in my",59
NA,"hand at the time, and the Prime Minister",59
NA,still said he had no knowledge of the matter.,59
NA,I state emphatically that the'restriction of,59
NA,credit then for the purchase of wool made,59
NA,it more difficult for people to buy. It re-,59
NA,stricted the number of purchasers because,59
NA,many of the small buyers were unable to,59
NA,operate owing to inability to obtain credit.,59
NA,This had the effect of reducing the price,59
NA,of wool. Those buyers were not asking,59
NA,for long term credit; they wanted only short,59
NA,term loans to cover the wool during transit,59
NA,and until the signing of the documents on,59
NA,"fhe other side of the world. After all,",59
NA,that is only the usual practice on the London,59
NA,market. These operators earn millions of,59
NA,pounds in profit out of financing the sale,59
NA,of wool in Australia whereas if Australia's,59
NA,Commonwealth Bank provided the financial,59
NA,assistance Austraha would receive millions,59
NA,of pounds in extra returns from the sales,59
NA,in- and would also enjoy the benefit of a con-,59
NA,siderable reduction in adverse overseas,59
NA,balances. Such charges as freight and in-,59
NA,"surance cost Australia about Â£100,000,000",59
NA,"a year, and I suggest that with the estab-",59
NA,"lishment of our own shipping line, the",59
NA,carrying of our own insurance and the,59
NA,financing of the sale of our primary pro-,60
NA,"ducts from Australian sources, similar to",60
NA,the way in which wheat sales are financed-,60
NA,by making advance payments to producers-,60
NA,Australia could effect a tremendous saving.,60
NA,"My time has nearly expired, and I hope",60
NA,that some of the points that I have made,60
NA,will be noted by the Government. The,60
NA,taxation proposals put forward in the Bud-,60
NA,"get are very illuminating indeed, and, after",60
NA,perusing a short summary of the Budget,60
NA,I find that increased social services and,60
NA,benefits to be granted to the people this,60
NA,"year will cost a little more than Â£20,000,000",60
NA,whereas increased taxes will return to the,60
NA,"Government an extra Â£78,500,000. This,",60
NA,"together with other increased charges, will",60
NA,"return an additional Â£97,300,000 to the",60
NA,"Government this year. It will be seen,",60
NA,"therefore, that although the Government",60
NA,takes credit for granting considerable con-,60
NA,cessions to the community by way of tax,60
NA,"reductions, more will be taken from the",60
NA,people this year.,60
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN , ( Mr.,60
NA,Luchetti) -Order ! The honorable mem-,60
NA,ber's time has expired.,60
Mr FAIRHALL ,Paterson) [5.20] -A s,60
NA,we are considering the state of the national,60
NA,economy in the context of the Budget pro-,60
NA,"posals, it is not inappropriate to do as I",60
NA,propose-spen d a few minutes looking at,60
NA,the wool industry. It is a happy circum-,60
NA,stance that the opening sales of the new,60
NA,season should have shown an increase of,60
NA,"from 10 per cent, to 15 per cent, in wool",60
NA,"returns, but I believe that would turn into",60
NA,an unhappy circumstance if we allowed,60
NA,ourselves to be bemused by the short-term,60
NA,advantages of this increased price because,60
NA,I think that in the long term the picture,60
NA,ahead of the wool industry is not nearly,60
NA,so bright.,60
NA,I am encouraged in that belief by the,60
NA,statement made by two informed contri-,60
NA,butors to the wool seminar organized by,60
NA,the Australian National University who,60
NA,"said of the demand for wool that "" only",60
NA,a narrow line separates prosperity from,60
NA,"disaster."" With that view I am inclined to",60
NA,"agree. Indeed, I believe that the time has",60
NA,come for a searching inquiry into the wool,60
NA,industry and the likely influence of the,60
NA,industry's future on the Australian,60
NA,economy.,60
NA,There is a general feeling of disquiet,60
NA,about the industry's prospects; but there is,60
NA,a general hope that whatever is wrong with,60
NA,the industry will somehow cure itself if,60
NA,we leave it alone. I do not believe that.,60
NA,If there is trouble ahead for the wool in-,60
NA,"dustry, there is equally trouble ahead for",60
NA,"the whole economy, and we ought to know",60
NA,"it. Therefore, I suggest that nothing short",60
NA,of a royal commission would be adequate,60
NA,to examine thoroughly all aspects of the,60
NA,wool industry and to present to the Aus-,60
NA,tralian people an integrated picture of the,60
NA,"industry which, more than all others, sup-",60
NA,ports Australia's economy. The wool in-,60
NA,dustry and its effects on Austraha and the,60
NA,Australian people must be got into the,60
NA,"headlines, and I believe that an inquiry",60
NA,by a royal commission would do just that.,60
NA,I believe that such a commission should,60
NA,be empowered to look into all aspects of,60
NA,"the wool industry-productio n and selling,",60
NA,the processing and marketing of the,60
NA,"finished product, and the need for and",60
NA,the adequacy of all phases of wool research,60
NA,and wool use promotion. There should be,60
NA,a study of the dependence of the Australian,60
NA,"economy on the wool industry, and, at the",60
NA,same time we ought to attempt to assess,60
NA,"the proportions, present and future, of the",60
NA,mounting competition presented to wool,60
NA,by synthetic fibres.,60
NA,The inquiry should lead to a well,60
NA,reasoned programme of what ought to be,60
NA,done to safeguard Australia's economy by,60
NA,preserving the health of the wool industry.,60
NA,"When, within one generation, the growth",60
NA,of synthetic fibres has become a menace to-,60
NA,"Australia's biggest export income earner,",60
NA,there is little room for believing that the,60
NA,wool industry is not threatened.,60
NA,"In recent times, there has been a great",60
NA,deal of wool promotion and wool advertis-,60
NA,"ing under the slogan ""There is no substi-",60
NA,"tute for wool."" Many people will stoutly",60
NA,declare that there is no possibility that,60
NA,"synthetics will ever really oust wool, but I",60
NA,believe that is a question which only the,60
NA,"future, and the laboratories in which tens",60
NA,of millions of pounds are being spent on,60
NA,research into synthetics can possibly,60
NA,"answer. In the meantime, the fact remains",60
NA,that in the United States of America which,60
NA,is generally taken as an indicator in matters-,60
NA,of this kind wool use has declined by 40,60
NA,"per cent, in the last eighteen years, and",60
NA,in that period there has been an enormous,61
NA,growth in the use of synthetic fibres.,61
NA,"There are some who believe that if we,",61
NA,"in Australia, keep telling ourselves that wool",61
NA,"is best, somehow, the future of wool will",61
NA,"be secured. But, again, we consume only",61
NA,"10 per cent, of our own production in",61
NA,"Australia, and the task is therefore to con-",61
NA,"vince the rest of the world that wool is best,",61
NA,and we must do this in the absence of any,61
NA,motive of natural loyalty.,61
NA,Nor is the threat to wool only from the,61
NA,synthetics. In a recently published volume,61
NA,"called "" People of Plenty-Economi c",61
NA,"Abundance and the American Character "",",61
NA,"the author, David M. Potter, said-",61
NA,Not only is the nourishment and housing,61
NA,also the clothing controlled by American,61
NA,dance. One of the most sweeping consequences,61
NA,of our abundance is that in contrast to other,61
NA,people who keep their bodies warm by wearing,61
NA,"clothing, we keep our bodies warm primarily",61
NA,the far more expensive and wasteful method,61
NA,heating the buildings in which they are sheltered.,61
NA,The oil furnace has not only displaced the open,61
NA,fire-place. It has also displaced the woollen,61
NA,undergarment and the vest.,61
NA,"In commercial language, Potter said that",61
NA,"wool has now to compete, not only with",61
NA,"dacron, orlon and nylon and the rest of the",61
NA,"synthetics, but also with more implacable",61
NA,antagonists-centra l heating and air,61
NA,"ditioning. It seems likely that, as Australian",61
NA,homes and other buildings yield to the march,61
NA,"of central heating and air conditioning,",61
NA,pattern of dressing will follow that of,61
NA,America. It is not without significance,61
NA,in all five major construction projects,61
NA,before the Commonwealth's own Public a,61
NA,"Works Committee, air-conditioning is",61
NA,posed. The pattern is beginning to estabyears.,61
NA,"lish itself here in Australia. Certainly,",61
NA,long woollen undergarment is,61
NA,out if it has not already gone. The waist-,61
NA,coat is dying away. The heavy all-woollen,61
NA,suit that used to be worn all the year round,61
NA,"is being replaced, for a large part of",61
NA,"year at least, by lighter suits made from",61
NA,wool and synthetics. The light top-coat,61
NA,the synthetic rain-coat have dealt a mortal,61
NA,blow at the all-wool great-coat and,61
NA,electric blanket is no longer a novelty.,61
NA,these things are biting into the wool market.,61
NA,"In the meantime, the wool-grower is",61
NA,ing the pinch. It is not as if increased wool,61
NA,production would help wool sales. An inlb.,61
NA,crease may only push down the price of wool,61
NA,to a level at which the producer who is tied,61
NA,"to fixed wages, fixed prices' of farm",61
NA,"machinery and services, and fixed interest",61
NA,"on overdraft, may not be able to stay in the",61
NA,wool business. Fluctuations in the price of,61
NA,"wool, as we have seen in recent years",61
NA,present great difficulties to the textile in-,61
NA,"dustries, a difficulty which manufacturers",61
NA,of synthetics have been quick to exploit by,61
NA,fixing the price of their product for long,61
NA,"periods even though, under prevailing con-",61
NA,"ditions in the market, they could have re-",61
NA,"ceived increased prices. Therefore, the",61
NA,fluctuation of wool prices may lead to,61
NA,further depression in the price of wool.,61
NA,"In the last few years, I think it is true",61
NA,"to say, particularly jn regard to marginal",61
NA,"but producers, that much of the Australian wool",61
NA,abunclip has not returned the cost of produc-,61
NA,"tion. The grower, therefore, has had the",61
NA,choice of receiving a salary for his work,61
NA,"by or a return on his investment, but not both.",61
NA,of Since he could invest his money with com-,61
NA,"parative safety at from 5 per cent, to 8",61
NA,"per cent., his decision to stay in the wool",61
NA,business is a gesture of unbridled optimism,61
NA,or indicates his inability to free himself,61
NA,from the land under existing conditions.,61
NA,A few years ago it might have been fanci-,61
NA,ful to suggest that the characteristics of,61
NA,conwool could be duplicated synthetically.,61
NA,"But now, with the accumulated knowledge",61
NA,"and experience, and the advances in tech-",61
NA,"our nology and techniques, we cannot be so",61
NA,"sure. Professor M. Chaiken, Professor of",61
NA,that Textile Technology at the University of,61
NA,"now New South Wales, has stated that there is",61
NA,danger that man-made fibres will supplant,61
NA,prowool completely in from ten to twenty,61
NA,"Certainly, this danger will increase",61
NA,the unless something quite adventurous is done,61
NA,on its way to keep wool in demand.,61
NA,Economic developments occur earliest in,61
NA,"the United States of America. There, the",61
NA,the consumption of fibres since 1940 shows a,61
NA,disturbing trend. Since that year rayon con-,61
NA,"and sumption has more than doubled, increas-",61
NA,"ing from 482,000,000 lb. to 1,108,000,000",61
NA,the lb. a year. Nylon consumption has in-,61
NA,"All creased from a miserable 3,000,000 lb. to",61
NA,"479,000,000 lb. Cotton has held its market",61
NA,feelreasonably well. Even the consumption of,61
NA,"textile glass has increased from 1,000,000",61
NA,"to 108,000,000 lb. a year. It appears",61
NA,that in that period the total consumption of,61
NA,"fibres increased by 22 per cent, while the",61
NA,only two to lose ground were wool and silk,62
NA,-bot h under competition from man-made,62
NA,fibres.,62
NA,Wool consumption in the United States,62
NA,"of America dropped from 434,000,000 lb.",62
NA,"in 1940 to 269,000,000 in 1947, yet over",62
NA,"those years, the population climbed from",62
NA,"131,000,000 to 174,000,000. It is clear",62
NA,"that people in the United States have not,",62
NA,"by any means, stopped buying textiles; but",62
NA,they are buying less wool. Between 1954,62
NA,"and 1957, world production of synthetic",62
NA,"fibres rose by about 30 per cent, per",62
NA,annum. The influences that work in,62
NA,America are not less active elsewhere in,62
NA,"major markets, nor even here in Australia,",62
NA,although the domestic effect is less pro-,62
NA,nounced because we are only a minor con-,62
NA,sumer of our own wool.,62
NA,It is true that no single textile-n o man-,62
NA,made fibre-has all the qualities of wool.,62
NA,But it is likewise true that wool is,62
NA,"markedly deficient of'some of the"" wanted",62
NA,qualities in textiles. The Commonwealth,62
NA,Scientific and Industrial Research Organ-,62
NA,ization recently published a research,62
NA,bulletin which included an article under,62
NA,"the title ""The Challenge to Wool"". In",62
NA,this article the qualities of wool were com-,62
NA,pared with those of man-made fibres. It,62
NA,showed that in the wanted qualities of,62
NA,"dyeing, heat resistance, moisture absorp-",62
NA,"tion and draping, wool left the synthetics",62
NA,far behind. But it also showed that in the,62
NA,equally wanted qualities of strength and,62
NA,"resistance to insects, wrinkling and shrink-",62
NA,"age, the synthetics held a handsome",62
NA,advantage.,62
NA,"It is worth mentioning, in passing, that",62
NA,this gives point to the value of blends of,62
NA,"wool and synthetics, because the buyer of",62
NA,textiles is concerned only with the finished,62
NA,fabric of superior quality and is little,62
NA,interested in the composition except in so,62
NA,far as it indicates the qualities that he is,62
NA,looking for. This statement also puts a,62
NA,heavy question mark against the views of,62
NA,"those, including some members of the",62
NA,"Australian Wool Bureau, who believe that",62
NA,Australia's wool publicity should not men-,62
NA,"tion synthetics or blends. The fear that,",62
NA,"in selling blends, we would be promoting",62
NA,"the sale of synthetics, is of doubtful",62
NA,"validity at this time. In any case, it is a",62
NA,F.6207/59 -R -[26 ],62
NA,question that ought to be settled by com-,62
NA,petent market research.,62
NA,There is more than a little evidence that,62
NA,"major wool processors, particularly in the",62
NA,"United States of America, are heavily",62
NA,engaged in the production of blends. Under,62
NA,"these conditions, wool promotion which",62
NA,ignores blends would be unrealistic. I,62
NA,"believe that, in the short term, man-made",62
NA,fibres and wool are complementary. But,62
NA,"it is true that, in the Jong run, synthetic",62
NA,research will work towards the complete,62
NA,replacement of wool. It is simple common,62
NA,sense that wool research must aim at pro-,62
NA,ducing in wooi all the advantages which,62
NA,are now possessed exclusively by the,62
NA,synthetics. It may very easily be that the,62
NA,"way to sell more wool, until research is",62
NA,further advanced-an d I have chosen,62
NA,those words carefully-i s to promote the,62
NA,marriage of wool and synthetics in the,62
NA,world's best textiles.,62
NA,I do not put forward that view as a,62
NA,"conclusion. I merely say that ""we should",62
NA,not dismiss the possibility but should seek,62
NA,to establish its truth or falsity. People,62
NA,throughout history have been saying that,62
NA,there is no substitute for a particular,62
NA,product. But substitutes have come and,62
NA,have replaced the product entirely or have,62
NA,eaten heavily into its market. What can,62
NA,happen is plainly written in the story of,62
NA,indigo for the production of which Indian,62
NA,"farmers once cultivated 1,500,000 acres-",62
NA,until European chemists learnt to produce,62
NA,analine dyes. Indian farmers then went out,62
NA,of the indigo business entirely and were,62
NA,obliged to find new products and new,62
NA,markets in a process which could only have,62
NA,been long and costly.,62
NA,Closer to us in time is the fate of the,62
NA,"Siberian hog which, as you know, pro-",62
NA,vided most of the bristles for the world's,62
NA,brushes. Although natural bristles are said,62
NA,"to have some great advantages, the fact",62
NA,"is that they went down before the synthetic,",62
NA,nylon. Silk met and succumbed to the,62
NA,same competition. It is true that silk is,62
NA,"still manufactured, but I doubt whether",62
NA,it would be were it not for the fact that,62
NA,workers in silk are among the most under-,62
NA,"paid workers in the world. Nevertheless,",62
NA,"in a few short years, nylon has cut the",62
NA,silk market in half. It has been reduced,62
NA,"from 130,000,000 lb. to 67,000,000 lb. in",62
NA,the last fifteen or eighteen years.,62
NA,"With these bits of history in mind, we",63
NA,ought to turn to an examination of Aus-,63
NA,tralia's dependence on the wool industry.,63
NA,"Unhappily, there are many who fail to",63
NA,understand the extent to which wool under-,63
NA,"pins our economy, but if the wool industry",63
NA,"goes into a decline, the Australian economy,",63
NA,"our wages, our salaries, and our standards",63
NA,"of living will, I believe, smartly follow it",63
NA,into the same sort of decline. It is a,63
NA,recommended exercise that we should think,63
NA,for a moment of the shape of an Aus-,63
NA,tralian economy without a wool industry of,63
NA,any great consequence. As the position is,63
NA,"now, and has been for years past, Aus-",63
NA,tralia has been warding off a very difficult,63
NA,balance-of-payments problem only by the,63
NA,imposition of the harshest import restric-,63
NA,tions. The apparent permanence of import,63
NA,restrictions is a by-product of our failure,63
NA,to match our appetite for imports with an,63
NA,ability to find abroad markets for our pro-,63
NA,"ducts. But, happily or unhappily, depend-",63
NA,"ing on how one looks at it, this position",63
NA,has been masked or obscured in recent,63
NA,"years by the inflow of capital, which",63
NA,"reached the total of Â£712,000,000 between",63
NA,1947 and 1956. But capital investment,63
NA,"could dry up overnight and, indeed, it",63
NA,would most certainly do so if anything,63
NA,happened in the wool industry to force a,63
NA,halt or even a recession in the general,63
NA,tempo of the Australian economy. Then,63
NA,"we would be left with the problem, often",63
NA,"referred to, of meeting dividend service",63
NA,on foreign investment from vastly reduced,63
NA,overseas earnings.,63
NA,"Industrially, we are a high-cost country,",63
NA,yet we are in competition with more,63
NA,"experienced, more populous, lower-cost pro-",63
NA,"ducers in the United States of America,",63
NA,"Europe, and, increasingly, in Asia. The",63
NA,prospect of making up in secondary pro-,63
NA,ducts what we lose in wool is a rather,63
NA,"bleak one, unless we are to accept a heavy",63
NA,"fall in wages or salaries. Apart from wool,",63
NA,in the field of primary produce our major,63
NA,"export items, wheat, dairy products, barley,",63
NA,"and so on, are meeting world surplus pro-",63
NA,"duction, much of which is subsidized by",63
NA,"governments, as in the case of American",63
NA,wheat. The one product in relation to,63
NA,"which we enjoy a great natural advantage,",63
NA,"and upon which we depend, is fine wool.",63
NA,It is clear that if our standards of living,63
NA,"are to be maintained in the future, we shall",63
NA,"depend on wool in two ways. First, it",63
NA,must earn our basic overseas income.,63
NA,"Secondly, it must service overseas invest-",63
NA,"ment in this country, which supports any",63
NA,hope we have of competing in the field,63
NA,of secondary industrial production.,63
NA,The first great task is to see that wool,63
NA,can foot the bill. We must know whether,63
NA,or not it is likely that wool can be replaced,63
NA,"in the foreseeable future and, if so, what",63
NA,we are going to do about it. This much is:,63
NA,certain: Australia will fall back to being a:,63
NA,very second-class nation indeed if wool goes,63
NA,the way of those scores of products which,63
NA,have been replaced by more useful or,63
NA,cheaper items. It ought to be kept in mind,63
NA,that wool provides in foreign exchange,63
NA,three times as much as do all of our manu-,63
NA,factured products combined. A permanent,63
NA,drop in wool exports would offer poor pros-,63
NA,pects for continued industrialization. It,63
NA,would cripple Australia's burgeoning indus-,63
NA,tries as much as it would cripple rural,63
NA,production.,63
NA,I repeat that it is hard to imagine Aus-,63
NA,tralia without a wool industry of some,63
NA,magnitude. We prefer not to think about,63
NA,"it, but for the sake of the future of this",63
NA,country's economy we ought to think about,63
NA,it in the most serious and close-up terms.,63
NA,"If we are to appreciate the problem, we",63
NA,ought first to get some idea of how big,63
NA,wool is in national or international stature.,63
NA,If our wool production were in the hands,63
NA,"of one company, it would rate only 57th",63
NA,place in the list of major productive enter-,63
NA,"prises in the United States, as published",63
NA,"by "" Fortune "" magazine. It is interesting",63
NA,to note that it would be considerably below,63
NA,Kodak in size and about one-third of the,63
NA,"size, in terms of turnover, of that enormous",63
NA,"competitor with wool, the Du Pont industry,",63
NA,"which is the producer of nylon, dacron,",63
NA,orlon and a large number of other syn-,63
NA,"thetics, and I am sure it will be the pro-",63
NA,ducer of more in the future.,63
NA,Research into wool can be a long and,63
NA,"costly business, even involving the sheep-",63
NA,"breeding programme, but the chemist in",63
NA,the synthetics laboratory is under no such,63
NA,handicap. He can try out new formula-,63
NA,tions and new techniques with small-batch,63
NA,"production, always with the likelihood of",63
NA,coming up with something new. With,63
NA,greater resources at his command,63
NA,he might allot 50 scientists to a,63
NA,particular project and waste some of,64
NA,"money, but, as I say, one never",64
NA,what will be uncovered. This fact alone,64
NA,gives the synthetic fibre industry an,64
NA,"mous advantage in its publicity, because",64
NA,"always has at hand some new, exciting",64
NA,synthetic which it can publicize. We are,64
NA,"left with wool, and it is a more difficult",64
NA,job to prove that wool is improving in,64
NA,"quality. The chemist, of course, is beating",64
NA,us hands down in the amount of money,64
NA,he has to spend on the development and,64
NA,promotion of his industry.,64
NA,We in Australia will have this year,64
NA,"Â£2,000,000 to spend on the wool industry.",64
NA,"By comparison, it is interesting to note",64
NA,the Celanese Corporation of America will,64
NA,"spend Â£2,500,000 on an industry which",64
NA,has a turnover less than one-third that,64
NA,"wool. The Du Pont organization, our to",64
NA,"most formidable competitor, with an",64
NA,"advertising budget of about Â£20,000,000",64
NA,"year, a research budget of. the same",64
NA,"portions, and an advertising public",64
NA,"tions staff that runs into hundreds, will",64
NA,be sparing the expense account. The,64
NA,Pont organization has pilot plants in which,64
NA,every known spinning and weaving device,64
NA,"is installed. It has textile experts,",64
NA,work with any manufacturer who seeks Producers Federation.,64
NA,assistance. It employs designers to help,64
NA,produce more suitable textiles. Its adverdisagreement,64
NA,tising agents are constantly engaged Jn,64
NA,"market research, testing the acceptability",64
NA,of its products. I refer honorable members,64
NA,to a recent bulletin of the Commonwealth,64
NA,"Scientific and Industrial Research Organizapromotion,",64
NA,"tion, containing photographs of a laborations,",64
NA,tory of this kind. Du Pont's task is,64
NA,get a bigger percentage of its products,64
NA,wool. Ours is the task of countering its,64
NA,"efforts, which will not be done by putting",64
NA,our heads in the sand. The market,64
NA,for us will be pretty cold and unfriendly,64
NA,and there is no room and less time for us,64
NA,to feel sorry for ourselves as we con-,64
NA,"template bigger, more powerful, better",64
NA,financed and very formidable competition.,64
NA,"The thing for us to do is assess the facts,",64
NA,to count the cost of failure and then,64
NA,decide what we must do to be saved. The,64
NA,"provision we are at present making, and",64
NA,reliance on prejudiced opinion rather,64
NA,"on scientific knowledge, will not help",64
NA,"to get through, and Australia's comindustry",64
NA,petitors in the world's textile market will,64
NA,his not sit by and wait for us to make up our,64
NA,knows minds. There is no doubt in my mind,64
NA,that the amount of money available for,64
NA,enorresearch and promotion will have to be,64
NA,it vastly increased. It may be that the pro-,64
NA,ducers' own contribution will need to be,64
NA,"expanded, but I believe the cost structure",64
NA,of the industry will still put a limit to that.,64
NA,"its Therefore, I think there will be a call on",64
NA,the Government to expand its support of,64
NA,what is in fact Australia's basic industry.,64
NA,"After all, we have subsidized butter. We",64
NA,"have not hesitated to support, by advertis-",64
NA,"about ing and promotion, the sale abroad of",64
NA,other primary products. We are to-day,64
NA,that offering great concessions in the field of,64
NA,oil search. These are very wise and proper,64
NA,"things to do, but if there is any validity",64
NA,"of in the points I have put forward, refusal",64
NA,further aid the wool industry will savour,64
NA,very much of giving away the substance,64
NA,a while we grasp at the shadow. I believe,64
NA,pror that it wpuld be timely and proper to,64
NA,relareconstruct the Australian Wool Bureau.,64
NA,"not It consists, as honorable members know,",64
NA,Du of seven members. One is a Government,64
NA,"nominee, and the other six are split evenly",64
NA,between the Australian Woolgrowers,64
NA,who Council and the Australian Wool and Meat,64
NA,"It is noted,",64
NA,"unhappily, that there is some evidence of",64
NA,between these two sections of,64
NA,the producing industry. I question whether,64
NA,the safeguarding of Australia's greatest,64
NA,"industry, whose problem is less one of",64
NA,"production than of market research, sales",64
NA,advertising and public rela-,64
NA,"can be left in the hands of graziers,",64
NA,to who may be the best men in the world at,64
NA,into their own jobs but who do not show any,64
NA,great capacity in the field of promotion or,64
NA,in the ability to control those who are,64
NA,place responsible for promotion.,64
NA,There appears to be a deep-rooted objec-,64
NA,tion to expanding the bureau to include,64
NA,"manufacturing and marketing experts, on",64
NA,"the ground, as I understand it, that it wou d",64
NA,open the way to outside interference with,64
NA,the wool-growers in the handling of their,64
NA,to own production which is understood to be,64
NA,the property of the wool producers them-,64
NA,"selves. Of course, we must have some re-",64
NA,"than gard to that point of view. But, as I",64
NA,"us believe an inquiry would show, the wool",64
NA,is so vital a part of Australia's,64
NA,"economy, future security and prosperity that",64
NA,the public interest in the handling of the,65
NA,wool clip may be greater than that of the,65
NA,producer. The grower has nothing to lose,65
NA,and everything to gain by an expanded,65
NA,effort to preserve the industry which under-,65
NA,"lies his personal fortunes. In fact, if the",65
NA,job is done properly-a s it must be-th e,65
NA,best interests of the wool-grower and the,65
NA,Australian people will be shown to be,65
NA,synonymous. That fact is already widely,65
NA,"appreciated by wool producers, many of",65
NA,whom are disturbed at the apparent lack of,65
NA,direction of present efforts in wool,65
NA,promotion.,65
NA,I am well aware of the difficulty of,65
NA,satisfying vocal opinion in the wool in-,65
NA,"dustry. Again, I beheve the findings of a",65
NA,royal commission would do much to bring,65
NA,"unified and positive thinking to the industry,",65
NA,to say nothing of support for a really worth-,65
NA,while plan of research and sales promotion.,65
NA,Hit or miss methods of research and sales,65
NA,"promotion will not-save the wool industry,",65
NA,and surely any bureau dealing with such an,65
NA,industry ought to include in its member-,65
NA,ship men experienced in textile research,65
NA,and production as well as advertising and,65
NA,marketing. To bring home to the Aus-,65
NA,tralian people the extent of their dependence,65
NA,on wool and to assemble the facts about,65
NA,"every phase of so important an industry, 1",65
NA,believe there should be a searching inquiry,65
NA,by a royal commission. If it is true that,65
NA,"the tide has set permanently against wool,",65
NA,it is necessary to recognize the fact at the,65
NA,earliest possible moment. We ought to,65
NA,know what we can do to replace declining,65
NA,wool income if such a position is inescap-,65
NA,"able. Certainly, progress will go on at an",65
NA,increasing rate in the synthetic fibre field.,65
NA,We must know as clearly as we can know,65
NA,what the end effect of this progress on our,65
NA,own economic affairs will be.,65
NA,In the face of the wonderful achievements,65
NA,"of t.:c chemical mdustry, I cannot believe",65
NA,that ever-increasing research will not pro-,65
NA,duce enormous progress towards the syn-,65
NA,thetic industry's goal of ousting wool.,65
NA,Nothing but good could come from concen-,65
NA,trating on the wool industry the undoubted,65
NA,talents and experience we have in this,65
NA,"country in wool growing and selling, wool",65
NA,"and textile research, market research,",65
NA,advertising and sales promotion for the,65
NA,benefit of the industry and the Australian,65
NA,economy. Hence the need for a royal,65
NA,commission-an d soon. We may elect to,65
NA,"wait and see, but Du Pont certainly will not",65
NA,"do so, nor will Imperial Chemical",65
NA,"Industries, Union Carbide, Celanese,",65
NA,"Courtaulds, Montecatini and the rest of the",65
NA,people who are engaged in the world's,65
NA,growing synthetic fibre industry. The,65
NA,"longer we wait, the easier it wili be for",65
NA,them.,65
Mr CLAY ,St. George) [5.48] -I t was,65
NA,right and proper that the honorable mem-,65
NA,ber for Paterson ( Mr Fairhall) should de-,65
NA,"vote so much of his time-i n fact, all his",65
NA,time-t o a discussion and examination of,65
NA,the subject of wool. There is no more,65
NA,important factor in the economy of Aus-,65
NA,tralia. I myself speak with the benefit of,65
NA,30 years practical experience in the textile,65
NA,"industry, and I think there would be few",65
NA,who would realize as fully as I do the,65
NA,importance of this industry to Australia,65
NA,"and also, so far as I am concerned, to the",65
NA,"field of employment, because"" this industrj'",65
NA,-,65
NA,is one of the few in which profitable em-,65
NA,ployment can be found for large numbers,65
NA,"of women. In that regard, it is almost",65
NA,unique.,65
NA,The honorable member for Paterson,65
NA,spoke of the substitutes which are being,65
NA,developed and which threaten the,65
NA,sovereignty of wool in the textile field. He,65
NA,spoke very well and very learnedly on that,65
NA,subject. I reflect upon what happened to,65
NA,another textile fibre in the natural field. I,65
NA,have heard far too many people say that,65
NA,there is no substitute for wool. I remem-,65
NA,ber tbe time when people were saying with,65
NA,similar confidence that there was no sub-,65
NA,stitute for silk. I well remember the enor-,65
NA,mous export market which Japan possessed,65
NA,in that natural fibre that we call silk. It,65
NA,"was largely used in clothing and hosiery,",65
NA,and Japan placed great reliance on silk to,65
NA,obtain overseas currency. Almost within,65
NA,"a few months, the silk industry of Japan",65
NA,collapsed and disappeared. I would not,65
NA,like to see the same fate overtake the,65
NA,"natural fibre upon which we place, I think,",65
NA,far too much reliance.,65
NA,With regard to the commodity we call,65
NA,"wool, I think it would be of great value if",65
NA,the Australian Government were to give,65
NA,even greater encouragement to the scientists,65
NA,of the Commonwealth Scientific and Indus-,65
NA,trial Research Organization who could then,65
NA,devote their remarkable talents towards im-,66
NA,proving this fibre. I remain unconvinced,66
NA,that it is difficult to improve this natural,66
NA,fibre. We might even reach the stage where,66
NA,"wool, taken from the sheep's back, will",66
NA,"not be spun, scoured and treated for the",66
NA,mills but taken to a plant where it will be,66
NA,subjected to solvents and extruded. But it,66
NA,remains for the scientists of the C.S.I.R.O.,66
NA,"with the requisite staff and money, to con-",66
NA,duct their investigations and examine what,66
NA,can be done with our most important,66
NA,primary product.,66
NA,Everybody is fully aware of the enormous,66
NA,financial value of wool to Australia. With-,66
NA,"out it, the standard of living in Australia",66
NA,would be much lower than it is. If its,66
NA,"value were to drop catastrophically, the",66
NA,effect would be widespread. At the wool,66
NA,sales immediately preceding the recent,66
NA,"sales, prices were much lower, and many",66
NA,"wool-growers, especially the smaller men,",66
NA,were in grave doubts about their financial,66
NA,stability. So it does not take a great drop,66
NA,in the price of wool to cause alarm to the,66
NA,wool-growers. When some possible calamity,66
NA,"appears on the horizon, I always wonder",66
NA,what the Government is doing about it.,66
NA,It has been said by the honorable member,66
NA,for Paterson that a relatively small sum,66
NA,of money is being spent on wool research.,66
NA,I believe-an d I am sure the honorable,66
NA,member will agree with me-tha t in view,66
NA,"of the enormous value of wool to Australia,",66
NA,if the expenditure on research into wool,66
NA,"were trebled or quadrupled, it would still",66
NA,not be too much. I have great confidence,66
NA,in the scientists of the C.S.I.R.O. When,66
NA,they brought a remedy to the wool indus-,66
NA,"try they produced that diabolical disease,",66
NA,"myxomatosis, but horrible as it was, they",66
NA,probably saved the Australian economy at,66
NA,the time. The price of wool was then,66
NA,dropping and had the rabbit population,66
NA,"remained at the level it had reached, there",66
NA,is no doubt there would have been a great,66
NA,drop in the production of wool as well as,66
NA,in its value.,66
NA,The scientists of the Commonwealth,66
NA,Scientific and Industrial Research Organi-,66
NA,zation came up with a remedy. I believe,66
NA,they could come up with some remedy,66
NA,whereby we can make this natural fibre,66
NA,superior to the synthetics which threaten,66
NA,it. Let me say this: It used to be a part,66
NA,of my business to go into the mills of this,66
NA,F.6207/59 -Jl -[27 ],66
NA,country and see the work being done. I,66
NA,refer particularly to the knitting of wool.,66
NA,I did not know-an d I still do not know-,66
NA,one manufacturer who would use wool if,66
NA,he could get the people to accept a sub-,66
NA,stitute- I am referring particularly to,66
NA,orlon-no t because the manufacturer is un-,66
NA,"patriotic or disloyal to Australia, but be-",66
NA,cause wool has been unstable in its price,66
NA,level.,66
NA,The manufacturers of this country have,66
NA,been grievously concerned about ordering,66
NA,commodities for which they have to pay,66
NA,three months in advance. If a change,66
NA,takes place in the price during the three,66
NA,months after they have made payment they,66
NA,can be put to great financial trouble. I,66
NA,myself have known manufacturers to be-,66
NA,come bankrupt because there was a change,66
NA,in the price of wool to their disadvantage.,66
NA,If we do not find some way to stabilize it,66
NA,-th e price of wool-manufacturer s will,66
NA,be less and less inclined to use our own,66
NA,most valuable product-wool . So I,66
NA,come back to this question: What is the,66
NA,Government doing about it?,66
NA,NA,66
Mr CLAY ,Tha t is the answer. The,66
NA,Government is doing nothing about it. I,66
NA,"do not say that it sits idly by, but it sits",66
NA,"by, adopting a Micawber-like attitude,",66
NA,hoping that something will turn up. I hope,66
NA,"that something does turn up, because I",66
NA,have a strong feeling that the time is not,66
NA,far distant when we will need something to,66
NA,turn up. I speak those words with great,66
NA,"feeling, because I think that the textile in-",66
NA,dustry of Australia is probably the most,66
NA,efficient industry in this country. I can,66
NA,"point to one mill in Newcastle-certainly ,",66
NA,"it processes cotton, but others process wool",66
NA,-whic h achieves a higher efficiency rating,66
NA,than any other mill in the world. I am,66
NA,thinking in terms of the United States of,66
NA,America and Japan. As honorable mem-,66
NA,"bers know, the textile industry of Japan is",66
NA,greatly assisted by the United States. I,66
NA,"would hate to see an industry such as this,",66
NA,which provides such a large amount of,66
NA,"employment for the families of Australia,",66
NA,threatened in any way by a catastrophe,66
NA,such as a fall in the price level of wool.,66
NA,"Mr Temporary Chairman, I have indi-",66
NA,cated to you that I think the remarks of,66
NA,the honorable member for Paterson very,66
NA,timely. It is my earnest hope that the,67
NA,members of the Government- I know that,67
NA,honorable members on this side of the,67
NA,chamber did pay very close attention to,67
NA,what he had to say-wil l heed what he said.,67
NA,Unless great notice is taken of the warning,67
NA,that has been issued by the honorable mem-,67
NA,"ber for Paterson, dire calamity can fall",67
NA,upon this country. I believe it is true to,67
NA,say that if there is a fall of only ld. per,67
NA,"in the price of wool, between Â£4,000,000",67
NA,"and Â£5,000,000 is lost in overseas earnings",67
NA,"to the people of Australia, or to the economy",67
NA,"of Australia. In consequence, I think that",67
NA,we have to do all that lies in our power-,67
NA,"of course, we on this side of the chamber",67
NA,can do very little except to exhort-t o in-,67
NA,duce the Government to spend the neces-,67
NA,sary money upon the encouragement of the,67
NA,scientists employed by the Commonwealth,67
NA,Scientific and Industrial Research Organi-,67
NA,"zation and, if necessary, bring scientists",67
NA,from other parts of the world to set their,67
NA,brains to work in order that the answer,67
NA,might be found to what looks like being,67
NA,a most difficult problem in the not very,67
NA,distant future.,67
NA,It has been revealed by the honorable,67
NA,member for Paterson that several millions,67
NA,of pounds are being spent by the Celanesc,67
NA,Corporation alone. It deals in an artificial,67
NA,fibre in the rayon field. When rayon was,67
NA,"first produced, there was great competition",67
NA,"between rayon and cotton, and the rayon",67
NA,manufacturers got the better of the battle,67
NA,until such time as the cotton manufacturers,67
NA,"of the world set to and, by research, im-",67
NA,"proved the fibre we call cotton, and",67
NA,gradually gained supremacy. In this com-,67
NA,petition the advantage frequency passes,67
NA,"from one fibre to another, and it is our job",67
NA,to see that the natural fibre that is so valu-,67
NA,able to us retains its supremacy over fibres,67
NA,"such as nylon, orlon and dacron.",67
NA,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,67
Mr CLAY ,Australi a places too much,67
NA,"reliance on wool, especially for the earning",67
NA,of overseas funds. We depend upon it,67
NA,more than is good for our own security in,67
NA,these times when the synthetics industry is,67
NA,developing as a field of danger for our wool,67
NA,industry.,67
NA,It is with some regret that I leave the,67
NA,subject of wool and return to the rather,67
NA,dreary subject of the Budget. Many words,67
NA,and many phrases have been applied in,67
NA,description of this Budget. Supporters of,67
NA,the Government have prated about the,67
NA,stability and expansion which are to flow,67
NA,from this year'sfinancialplanning. The use,67
NA,"of the words "" stability "" and "" expansion """,67
NA,in descriptions of the Budget intrigue me.,67
NA,""" Stability "" is defined in Nuttall's Diction-",67
NA,"lb. ary as "" the dynamic condition by which a",67
NA,"body retains its condition, shape or",67
NA,"motion "". Expansion is, of course, the act",67
NA,"of expanding, or the state of being ex-",67
NA,panded. So we have this contradiction-,67
NA,a condition in which the economy will not,67
NA,"alter its position, shape or motion, although",67
NA,at the same time it will expand!,67
NA,The people will surely be dazed by the,67
NA,Treasurer's profound pronouncements.,67
NA,They will be dazed even further by the,67
NA,"gifts contained in the Budget, which remind",67
NA,me strongly of the gift of the Trojan horse,67
NA,which led to the fall of Troy. Those who,67
NA,know the ancient Greek story will recollect,67
NA,that for a long time the besieging Greeks,67
NA,had failed to breach the walls of Troy. So,67
NA,they left a gift for the Trojans outside the,67
NA,"walls, and the Trojans foolishly accepted it",67
NA,and brought it within their gates. It was,67
NA,"a wooden horse filled with armed men, and",67
NA,so Troy fell. Apparently justice is done,67
NA,"in this Budget in a Trojan horse fashion,",67
NA,by giving equally to the rich and to the,67
NA,"poor. The 5 per cent, reduction in income",67
NA,tax applies to all. I find it just a little,67
NA,"difficult to comprehend this Liberal justice,",67
NA,which gives 6d. to the poor and Â£1 to the,67
NA,"rich. But then, of course, we people on",67
NA,this side of the chamber are biased. We,67
NA,persist in thinking that the man with the,67
NA,6d. is entitled to even more consideration.,67
NA,The honorable member for Melbourne,67
NA,( Mr Calwell) has described the Treasurer,67
NA,"as "" Robin Hood in reverse"", as a man",67
NA,who has robbed the poor to help the rich.,67
NA,He could have gone even further and,67
NA,"described the Treasurer as a "" Robin Hood-",67
NA,"wink "", the modern magician from the",67
NA,party which has modified Abraham,67
NA,Lincoln's famous dictum by showing that,67
NA,you can fool enough of the people for,67
NA,enough of the time. This is done by means,67
NA,of financial legerdemain in the first and,67
NA,"second years of a three-year term, and",67
NA,"removing the pressure in the third year, in",67
NA,which year the electors have a say. This,68
NA,policy has characterized the actions of the,68
NA,"Government since December, 1949, and I",68
NA,have sufficient faith in the intelligence of,68
NA,the Australian people to believe that the,68
NA,Government cannot fool enough of the,68
NA,people for very much longer. The Budget,68
NA,is a vivid illustration of the Government's,68
NA,contempt for public opinion in the first,68
NA,year of a three-year term.,68
NA,I want to make some reference during,68
NA,the course of this speech to the allied,68
NA,"lems of housing and immigration, because",68
NA,to me they seem to be inseparable. It is,68
NA,most curious thing that at this particular,68
NA,"time there is, as there has been for",68
NA,"years past, no shortage of bricks, timber,",68
NA,"glass, tiles, iron, or any one",68
NA,which are so necessary for the building of,68
NA,a home; yet Australians and immigrants,68
NA,alike are finding the housing situation,68
NA,"perate. Only a few days ago, in this",68
NA,"chamber, we were debating the Matrimonial",68
NA,Causes Bill. A considerable part of the,68
NA,discussion on that bill showed that it,68
NA,agreed on both sides that the absence of,68
NA,"housing for a very large number of people,",68
NA,or the availability to them of unsatisfactory,68
NA,"housing only, contributed materially to",68
NA,divorce rate in Australia. Housing plays,68
NA,very important part in several of the,68
NA,lems which trouble the minds of honorable,68
NA,members. I suggest to the Government,68
NA,"that since we desire more and more,",68
NA,"Australia needs more and more,",68
NA,"best type of immigrant, there is no better",68
NA,way to go about getting them than to be,68
NA,able to tell intending migrants in Europe,68
NA,the United States that they can be sure,68
NA,that when they reach these shores they,68
NA,will have no difficulty in getting themeighteen,68
NA,selves established in a home where they,68
NA,can live in comfort and raise their families.,68
NA,"It might be said, and it has been",68
NA,that on this side of the chamber we are,68
NA,completely destructive in our approach,68
NA,the Budget. I wish to deny that the Labour,68
NA,Party's attitude to this Budget,68
NA,destructive. Certainly there are many,68
NA,features of it about which we feel highly,68
NA,critical. I want to suggest to the Governphone,68
NA,"ment, for what it is worth, that if it wants",68
NA,to assist in solving the housing problem,68
NA,should not leave the matter entirely in,68
NA,"hands of the States, but should go to the",68
NA,rescue of the States. One way in which,68
NA,it could do so would be to facilitate the,68
NA,construction of large blocks of flats in or,68
NA,near the cities and towns of this country.,68
NA,Young married couples in the first few years,68
NA,of their married lives might be much better,68
NA,housed in flats than in homes. This would,68
NA,relieve them of the need to find the enor-,68
NA,mous amount of money required for a,68
NA,deposit on a home early in their married,68
NA,"life, and would save them the enormous",68
NA,expenditure associated with the first few,68
NA,years of buying a home. If married couples,68
NA,probcould rent flats for a few years they would,68
NA,have a chance to establish their finances,68
NA,a so that later they could build or acquire,68
NA,homes in which to establish families.,68
NA,some Honorable members on both sides of the,68
NA,House agree that there are no better people,68
NA,of the materials than family people.,68
NA,As an indication of how badly people,68
NA,desneed homes I remind honorable members,68
NA,very of the very large number of what are,68
NA,"called "" home units "" being erected in our",68
NA,cities. I know that many such units have,68
NA,"was been built in or around Sydney, and I",68
NA,presume that that is also the case in other,68
NA,cities. That indicates to me quite plainly,68
NA,the desire of many people to acquire a,68
NA,the home at any cost If such people could,68
NA,a rent flats I am sure that there would be,68
NA,proba desirable diminution of the number of,68
NA,"home units being built, and there would",68
NA,also be a greater number of places avail-,68
NA,and able for young people to occupy in the,68
NA,of the early years of their marriage.,68
NA,Before I leave the subject of housing,68
NA,or I wish to make brief reference to the quite,68
NA,large number of people who come to my,68
NA,office with complaints about the delay of,68
NA,months between the approval of,68
NA,a war service housing loan and the actual,68
NA,paying over of the money. I think it is,68
NA,deplorable that the heroes of the last war,68
NA,should have to wait eighteen months for a,68
NA,"said, loan. During that period of eighteen",68
NA,months many of these people make private,68
NA,to arrangements with finance companies for,68
NA,temporary loans; so the finance companies,68
NA,is entirely profit by this delay.,68
NA,I shall make a brief reference to tele-,68
NA,and bulk postal charges. I remind,68
NA,"all people who have a private telephone, if",68
NA,"it they need reminding, that a local call will",68
NA,the cost them a penny extra from now on and,68
NA,that the rental of the telephone will be,68
NA,increased by Â£2. I presume that the,68
NA,increase of Â£2 applies to a six-monthly,69
NA,"period, which will mean an increase of Â£4",69
NA,a year. Telephones are rapidly becoming,69
NA,a luxury. There are in my electorate many,69
NA,old people who rely on a telephone as their,69
NA,"only means of calling help, to send an SOS",69
NA,should something happen to them. If the,69
NA,Government makes it hard for them to,69
NA,"own a telephone, I know that their diffi-",69
NA,culties are going to be greatly increased.,69
NA,I know what will happen to the printing,69
NA,"trade as a result of the bulk postage charges,",69
NA,"and so does everybody else, so I shall not",69
NA,labour the proposed increase. I deplore,69
NA,the fact that this Budget contains nothing,69
NA,to help blind people to get a telephone.,69
NA,I think that blind people ought to be able,69
NA,"to obtain telephones free of charge, and",69
NA,I think most other people will agree with,69
NA,me.,69
NA,I want to make a brief reference,69
NA,"defence. First, let me congratulate the older.",69
NA,scientists who developed the Malkara and,69
NA,thereby helped to make Australia safe from,69
NA,the invasion which one day may threaten.,69
NA,I think we all are conscious of the,69
NA,"that one day invasion may be threatened,",69
NA,and we know from where the threat may,69
NA,come. I have taken some interest in the,69
NA,Army. I went to Mackay at the invitation,69
NA,of the Minister for the Army ( Mr Cramer).,69
NA,"I am very .glad that he invited me, because",69
NA,I came into contact there with omcers,69
NA,"men of the Citizen Military Forces,",69
NA,whom I cannot speak too highly. I think,69
NA,it is a wonderful thing that there are,69
NA,many thousands of young men and middle300,69
NA,"aged men who devote their time, and",69
NA,"a little of their own money, to training",69
NA,themselves to defend this country in,69
NA,hour of need.,69
NA,I wish now to refer to local government,69
NA,and to say that this Government should,69
NA,relieve local government authorities of,69
NA,"necessity to pay"" pay-roll tax.",69
NA,ties provide so many facilities for the,69
NA,people that it is time they received some,69
NA,help from this Government. They cannot,69
NA,get the loan funds they cry out for-and,69
NA,"Lord knows, they cry loud enough for",69
NA,If the Government wants to help them,69
NA,some way it should relieve them of the need,69
NA,to pay pay-roll tax.,69
NA,I think it is time that somebody on,69
NA,side of the chamber made a kindly remark,69
NA,"about General Motors-Holden's Limited,",69
NA,and I propose to do that. General Motors-,69
NA,"Holden's is the only big company, that I",69
NA,know of which makes no attempt to water,69
NA,"its capital or to conceal its profits. For that,",69
NA,I congratulate its directors. Sometimes I,69
NA,wonder what would have happened had the,69
NA,directors of General Motors-Holden's been,69
NA,Australians.,69
NA,I also want to refer briefly to the Boeing,69
NA,707 aircraft which plague the suburbs sur-,69
NA,rounding Kingsford-Smith aerodrome.,69
NA,They are the noisiest planes ever built. I,69
NA,"have heard them pass overhead, and the",69
NA,noise is like the approach of a typhoon. It,69
NA,"grows to a crescendo, so that conversation",69
NA,becomes impossible until it gradually dies,69
NA,away. There is no nuisance so great to the,69
NA,people living in the suburbs around the,69
NA,"Kingsford-Smith airport as the Boeing 707,",69
NA,and the people of Melbourne will know all,69
NA,"to about it too, before they are many months",69
NA,I suggest that the Government give close,69
NA,consideration to what has been done at,69
NA,"fact Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong, where a",69
NA,promontory has been built to take a run-,69
NA,way. A promontory could be built into,69
NA,"Botany Bay, as far as the Heads, if neces-",69
NA,"sary. If that were done, all aircraft could",69
NA,land or take off along the promontory,69
NA,extending out into the bay. I am told that,69
NA,and they could do this. The roadway known,69
NA,of as General Holmes Drive could be dropped,69
NA,"a few feet, and there would be no need to",69
NA,so hold up traffic. There would no longer be,69
NA,"or 400 motor cars held up, waiting for",69
NA,not a Boeing to pass overhead. The lights,69
NA,could be taken away. The noise nuisance,69
NA,"an would almost cease to exist. In addition,",69
NA,planes could take off with much greater,69
NA,safety if they were taking off along a run-,69
NA,way that extended over the water. How-,69
NA,"ever, this Government gives no sign of",69
NA,the doing anything about constructing such a,69
NA,Such authoripromontory into Botany Bay.,69
NA,Perhaps the safety factor is the most im-,69
NA,portant factor of all in this connexion. 1,69
NA,", warn this Government that one of these",69
NA,them. days an accident will happen. If one of,69
NA,in these metal monsters crashes on a school,69
NA,"or a hospital in the St. George district, woe",69
NA,betide this Government. Thousands of,69
NA,this gallons of inflammable liquid might drop,69
NA,"on a three-story school or hospital, and a",69
NA,thousand lives could be lost in the holocaust,69
NA,-or inferno that would follow. Let no one,70
NA,-say that that could not happen. Such things,70
NA,-can always happen. We should not be run-,70
NA,ning the risk of their happening.,70
NA,I want to congratulate the Government,70
NA,-on its social services and on the very prodi-,70
NA,.gal generosity that it has displayed towards,70
NA,"the old, the ill and the widowed. The Go-",70
NA,vernment proposes to give them an addi-,70
NA,"tional 7s. 6d. a week, as if that were the",70
NA,last drop of its heart's blood. These old,70
NA,people made Australia what it is to-day. If,70
NA,"we are enjoying life, it is because the old",70
NA,people of Australia made it possible for us.,70
NA,Well might they say-,70
NA,How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is,70
NA,To have a thankless child!,70
NA,This Government proposes to reduce,70
NA,"taxation for all by 5 per cent., which, of",70
NA,"course, will give great benefits to the rich",70
NA,and little or next to nothing to the people,70
NA,on lower incomes. What decent person,70
NA,would not have preferred taxes to stay as,70
NA,they were in order that those on whom the,70
NA,burdens of age and the hammer blows of,70
NA,misfortune have fallen might have a little,70
NA,more? Were it not for the fact that we,70
NA,have a number of service clubs to help,70
NA,"out, the situation would be a great deal",70
NA,worse for those in our midst who are,70
NA,fortunate than we are.,70
NA,Has this Government no heart? Has it,70
NA,no shame? Has it no conception of,70
NA,wounds dealt by death when it takes the,70
NA,"breadwinner? Do we, too, have to join",70
NA,with death in deepening the wounds inprovide,70
NA,flicted on a widow in the loneliness which,70
NA,comes from separation by death? We give,70
NA,"her 7s. 6d. a week extra and say, "" Be",70
NA,"happy "". No one has a greater call on",70
NA,greatest virtue of all-charity-tha n,70
NA,the widow. But this Government allows proceed.,70
NA,her tears to pass unnoticed. Her cries,70
NA,remain unheard.,70
NA,I want to say a few words about the,70
NA,"means test, in the few minutes that remain",70
NA,to me. I call the means test a penalty,70
NA,for thrift and self-denial. We preached,70
NA,the people during many of the years that,70
NA,have passed and we told them they should,70
NA,save and prepare for their old age. We,70
NA,"said to them, "" I f you do those things",70
NA,will be much better off towards the end of,70
NA,"your days"". What is their reward?",70
The CHAIRMAN , Mr Bowden) -,70
NA,Order! The honorable member's time has,70
NA,expired.,70
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,Higgins-Trea -,70
NA,surer) [8.18].^rLess than three weeks ago,70
NA,"I presented, on behalf of the Common-",70
NA,"wealth Government, the financial pro-",70
NA,gramme for the year 1959-60. The Oppo-,70
NA,sition has taken the course of moving the,70
NA,traditional amendment to the Budget by,70
NA,way of a vote of censure on this Govern-,70
NA,ment. Honorable members on this side of,70
NA,"the House, Sir, have not been greatly im-",70
NA,"pressed-nor , 1 feel, has the country-b y",70
NA,the efforts so far of honorable gentlemen,70
NA,"opposite to attack the Government, but at",70
NA,least from my point of view they have,70
NA,served a useful purpose in giving me a,70
NA,chance to come back into the debate and,70
NA,"answer criticisms, not only those which",70
NA,"have come from across the chamber and,",70
NA,"indeed, a few from my own side of the",70
NA,"committee, but also some which have come",70
NA,from outside.,70
NA,"As I turn to those criticisms, Sir, it",70
NA,"might be as well, in order to get the dis-",70
NA,"cussion back into perspective, if I were to",70
NA,us restate quite briefly what the Budget sets,70
NA,"out to do; indeed, what every financial",70
NA,less statement on behalf of this Government,70
NA,at Budget time has sought to do during,70
NA,our ten years of office. We aim to develop,70
NA,the Australia. We aim to continue a high,70
NA,level of employment with jobs for all who,70
NA,are able and willing to work. We aim to,70
NA,for our national security and to,70
NA,apply a spirit of social justice to the policies,70
NA,that we hope to implement. At the same,70
NA,time we aim to hold costs and prices stable,70
NA,the so that there shall be a sound economic,70
NA,' has base upon which our development can,70
NA,I stressed in my Budget speech that our,70
NA,twin objectives for Australia are stability,70
NA,and expansion. A welter of criticism has,70
NA,"been directed to the Budget since that time,",70
NA,but I submit that none of it has really,70
NA,to shaken those elements that I announced to,70
NA,the committee. Honorable members have,70
NA,"questioned some of the elements, but no",70
NA,onehas really shaken what we consider to,70
NA,you be the foundations of Australian develop-,70
NA,"ment and prosperity at this time, nor indeed",70
NA,the principles upon which we have acted.,70
NA,It is signincant that in this debate on a,71
NA,budget which relates to the financial cir-,71
NA,cumstances not only for the Commonwealth,71
NA,Government but also of six State govern-,71
NA,"ments, which covers the expenditures of",71
NA,"22 departments of state, which touches the",71
NA,financial circumstances of every citizen of,71
NA,this Commonwealth and which involves a,71
NA,"total expenditure of Â£1,682,000,000 and a",71
NA,"host of items, the argument now seems to",71
NA,"be narrowing down to the Â£4,000,000 or",71
NA,"Â£5,000,000 that is concerned mainly with",71
NA,bulk commercial postage. The mass of,71
NA,people outside are left unmoved by the,71
NA,criticisms of honorable gentlemen opposite.,71
NA,They .recognize that Australia is moving,71
NA,steadily forward. In my Budget speech I,71
NA,forecast that Australia and all sections of,71
NA,Australians could be assured of a favorable,71
NA,year. Such pointers as have developed,71
NA,since that time all are confirming the assessmuch,71
NA,ment that I was then able to make.,71
NA,There should be no surprise that the,71
NA,Budget evoked criticisms from many,71
NA,quarters. We have become accustomed in,71
NA,Australia to a certain pattern of criticism,71
NA,which develops after each budget is pre-,71
NA,"sented. First, there is the immediate",71
NA,"criticism that comes from the press, and I",71
NA,say in no unkindly spirit that the commer-,71
NA,cial press of this country has long realized,71
NA,"that circulation is built more by criticism,",71
NA,"and particularly sensational criticism, than",71
NA,it is by commendation. That lesson has not,71
NA,been lost on others who have observed the,71
NA,press techniques.,71
NA,"Then, of course, there are the criticisms",71
NA,that come from the spokesmen for sectional,71
NA,"interests, and there are hordes of them in",71
NA,"Australia, Their numbers grow each year",71
NA,and they come to governments with their,71
NA,requests. They overstate those requests,71
NA,before the Budget is presented. Human,71
NA,"nature being what it is, they tend to pitch",71
NA,"their requests rather high, perhaps thinking",71
NA,that if they get one-half or one-third of,71
NA,"what they ask for, they will not have",71
NA,badly. Then after the Budget has given,71
NA,them the one-half or one-third of what they,71
NA,"requested, they cannot afford to commend",71
NA,it because they had asked for something,71
NA,"more. So, every budget is a disappointing",71
NA,budget to the spokesmen for our sectional,71
NA,interests.,71
NA,Then we come to the political opposition.,71
NA,"Of course, it would be expecting too much,",71
NA,and displaying optimism far beyond even my,71
NA,"buoyant temperament, to ask for commen-",71
NA,dation from an Opposition of a budget intro-,71
NA,"duced from this side of the chamber. Indeed,",71
NA,if we got commendation we would begin to,71
NA,"wonder where we were going wrong,",71
NA,because quite certainly I never intended at,71
NA,any stage to produce a budget that would,71
NA,appeal to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr,71
NA,"Evatt) and his socialist colleagues nor, I",71
NA,"gather, have I done so, judging by what they",71
NA,have been saying.,71
NA,There have been some criticisms from my,71
NA,"own side of the chamber, and I shall deal",71
NA,"with all of them brieffy, if I can. But if",71
NA,"anybody has taken the trouble, as naturally",71
NA,"I have, to follow closely what the critics",71
NA,"have said, he will have discovered that",71
NA,of the criticism tends to cancel out.,71
NA,"On the one hand, for example, there was a",71
NA,fairly general press criticism that the Budget,71
NA,"was too timid, too conservative, that it",71
NA,"reflected cautionary Treasury thinking, that",71
NA,"we should have been bolder, and that we",71
NA,should have gone for bigger expenditures in,71
NA,certain directions. If that is one's point of,71
NA,"view it is a valid criticism, but it cancels",71
NA,out-o r tends to-th e criticism voiced by,71
NA,some of the more thoughtful members of,71
NA,"the Parliament, that far from being too",71
NA,"timid and too conservative, this is a budget",71
NA,that threatens inflation in this country,71
NA,because we are budgeting for a deficit of,71
NA,"Â£61.000,000. Both sets of critics cannot be",71
NA,"right, and I prefer to believe that the Go-",71
NA,vernment has adopted a reasonable balance,71
NA,in this matter.,71
NA,It is true that we have budgeted for a,71
NA,quite substantial deficit and that there is the,71
NA,normal desire to balance one's accounts.,71
NA,But let me just mention three factors,71
NA,which I believe justified-an d indeed made,71
NA,desirable-som e deficit financing on this,71
NA,occasion. One is that we expect to have,71
NA,"about 80,000 additional people available for",71
NA,the work force in the course of the current,71
NA,done year. We must provide opportunities for,71
NA,them. There must be an expansion of in-,71
NA,dustry and of the employment that industry,71
NA,can provide. Another factor is that in the,71
NA,course of the year we will be importing an,71
NA,"additional Â£50,000,000 worth of goods com-",71
NA,pared with last year. This itself is a counter-,71
NA,inflationary matter. The third factor is that,71
NA,"inside the Budget, on the revenue account,",72
NA,"about Â£150,000,000 is to be provided lor",72
NA,the capital works of the Commonwealth,72
NA,"Government. Normally, we would have",72
NA,"hoped to raise that money by loan, but for",72
NA,reasons with which honorable gentlemen are,72
NA,"familiar, we now have to take it from",72
NA,"revenue. In addition to that Â£150,000,000",72
NA,"there is another Â£37,000,000, of which",72
NA,"Â£30,000,000 is to bridge the gap between",72
NA,"our estimated loan raisings of Â£190,000,000",72
NA,"and the Â£220,000,000 which the States have",72
NA,agreed upon as a loan programme for this,72
NA,"year and the remaining Â£7,000,000 of which",72
NA,"is for land settlement. So, although on the",72
NA,face of it there is a deficit and the cash is,72
NA,"short to that extent, it is not as irrespon-",72
NA,sible as deficit financing sometimes proves,72
NA,"to be, because I repeat that we have this",72
NA,very substantial volume of what is in effect,72
NA,capital provision being made out of our,72
NA,revenues this year.,72
NA,Other criticisms also tend to cancel out.,72
NA,The Leader of the Opposition is the only,72
NA,one of the critics who has managed to have,72
NA,"it both ways. He attacked us, first, because",72
NA,in his view we were not providing enough,72
NA,by way of taxation relief-an d I will come,72
NA,to that in a little more detail later. Then,72
NA,he said that we were too niggardly with our,72
NA,provision for social services. In other,72
NA,"words, he recommended an expansion of",72
NA,expenditure in this and other directions.,72
NA,But at the same time he attacked every,72
NA,provision that we had made for getting in-,72
NA,creased revenue. He was against what we,72
NA,were doing in the field of postal charges.,72
NA,He was against what we were doing in,72
NA,niaking a charge for pharmaceutical bene-,72
NA,fits. Whilst attacking the charges that we,72
NA,"were imposing and, at the same time",72
NA,"recommending increased expenditures, the",72
NA,right honorable gentleman was saying that,72
NA,our policy was one of creeping inflation.,72
NA,"Well, what would his policy be in the cir-",72
NA,cumstances? He made it quite clear that,72
NA,he was also critical because we proposed to,72
NA,raise by way of loan money which he said,72
NA,could be provided by treasury-bills. In,72
NA,"those three criticisms, taken together, the",72
NA,right honorable gentleman has made it,72
NA,abundantly clear that the policy of the,72
NA,Australian Labour Party would produce,72
NA,"not creeping inflation, but galloping",72
NA,inflation.,72
NA,Mr Crean -Yo n are the last one who,72
NA,should talk about inflation.,72
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,"Well , I have",72
NA,been talking about it for some little time.,72
NA,"When he came to the item of taxation, the",72
NA,Leader of the Opposition had his criticisms,72
NA,"to make, and they were in these terms-",72
NA,Apart from its miserable halfpenny reduction,72
NA,"in customs duty on petrol, the Government failed",72
NA,"in the Budget to reduce customs duty, excise duty,",72
NA,"pay-roll tax or sales tax, particularly on household",72
NA,goods.,72
NA,"All of us in this place know that, when you",72
NA,"look at a particular budget, to be reason-",72
NA,able and fair you do not treat it in isolation,72
NA,"from other budgets which have preceded it,",72
NA,nor do you treat it in isolation from other,72
NA,important economic events that have,72
NA,occurred during the year. Let us look at,72
NA,some of these earlier matters and link them,72
NA,up with what we have done in this Budget.,72
NA,"Of course, all taxes cannot be reduced in",72
NA,"all budgets, unless a government is prepared",72
NA,to budget for enormous inflationary deficits,72
NA,far beyond anything that we would be will-,72
NA,ing to contemplate. Although tax con-,72
NA,cessions in the present Budget are confined,72
NA,"almost wholly to income tax, we have",72
NA,granted concessions in taxes of every kind,72
NA,in our previous budgets when economic and,72
NA,financial circumstances have permitted us,72
NA,to do so.,72
NA,Let me remind the committee that since,72
NA,we took office complete exemption from,72
NA,sales tax has been granted on well over 100,72
NA,"items, many of which were foodstuffs and",72
NA,household goods subject to sales tax while,72
NA,Labour was in office. Honorable members,72
NA,opposite talk about our not doing anything,72
NA,"on pay-roll tax. Well, at least we have im-",72
NA,proved things in this direction since we,72
NA,assumed office. The pay-roll tax exemption,72
NA,"was increased from Â£1,040 per annum, that",72
NA,being the exemption in force when we took,72
NA,"office, to Â£4,160. It was subsequently in-",72
NA,"creased to Â£6,240, and in 1957 to Â£10,400.",72
NA,"As a result, the number of employers paying",72
NA,pay-roll tax has been reduced by approxi-,72
NA,"mately 70,000 since this Government",72
NA,"assumed office. As is well known, we have",72
NA,"abolished land tax and entertainment tax,",72
NA,which previously were levied by the Labour,72
NA,government.,72
NA,One point of the Opposition's criticism,72
NA,"was that, although we had made some taxa-",72
NA,"tion concessions, this was a rich man's",72
NA,"Budget-i n other words, that those con-",72
NA,cessions had been made in favour of the,72
NA,wealthy against the poor. I repeat that it is,72
NA,utterly unfair to treat a budget item as being,73
NA,unrelated to anything else that has occurred.,73
NA,"When we were making our Budget decisions,",73
NA,we found that the great mass of Australian,73
NA,wage-earners had already benefited this year,73
NA,by what was a quite substantial increase of,73
NA,"the basic wage, that a margins case was in",73
NA,"the course of being heard, that pensioners",73
NA,would be receiving additional benefits under,73
NA,"the Budget, and that most sections of the",73
NA,community had shared in one way or another,73
NA,in the benefits of a reasonably prosperous,73
NA,year.,73
NA,It is not often that one can touch the in-,73
NA,come tax structure. You obviously do not,73
NA,want to be chopping and changing your tax,73
NA,rates from year to year. As I pointed out,73
NA,"earlier, in recent years a vast sum has been",73
NA,raised annually from revenue for capital,73
NA,"purposes. This year, having regard to that",73
NA,circumstance in itself and to the benefits,73
NA,"which others had received, we felt that the",73
NA,"small degree, the modest degree, of tax re-",73
NA,duction on the direct income scale was,73
NA,justified.,73
NA,"It is said, Mr Chairman, that the Budget",73
NA,favours the rich against the poor. The fact,73
NA,of the matter is that the man who at present,73
NA,is paying 60 dmes as much tax as another,73
NA,man will continue to pay 60 times as,73
NA,much tax as that man on the smaller in-,73
NA,come. The Prime Minister ( Mr Menzies),73
NA,demonstrated very effectively that the pro-,73
NA,portion of tax levied by us on the higher,73
NA,incomes is in excess of that which was,73
NA,levied by Labour when it was in office. He,73
NA,"might have added that, so far as company",73
NA,"tax is concerned, this Government could",73
NA,hardly be accused of being more tender,73
NA,towards the companies than was the Labour,73
NA,"government. When we assumed office,",73
NA,the general rate of company tax was 7s. in,73
NA,the Â£1. During our term of office it has,73
NA,fluctuated at different times and has risen,73
NA,to as high as 9s. in the Â£1. At the moment,73
NA,it stands at 7s. 6d. I find it a little ironical,73
NA,"that, while on the one hand I as Treasurer",73
NA,am attacked by honorable gentlemen oppo-,73
NA,"site who say it is a rich man's budget, on",73
NA,the other hand I have been strongly criti-,73
NA,"cized by the Taxpayers' Association, the",73
NA,Chamber of Manufactures and the Cham-,73
NA,ber of Commerce for being far too nig-,73
NA,gardly in the tax provision that I have been,73
NA,able to make by way of benefit to their,73
NA,members. I think most fair-minded people,73
NA,will agree that we have done what was-,73
NA,reasonable in the circumstances.,73
NA,I deplore the attempt by honorable,73
NA,gentlemen opposite to create in the minds,73
NA,of the Australian public a picture of a,73
NA,government legislating along class lines.,73
NA,Theirs is a shabby and mischievious charge-,73
NA,"-on e which this Government, by its per-",73
NA,"formance during its ten years of office, has.",73
NA,shown should not be levelled against it.,73
NA,We would not be here in this chamber,73
NA,to-day with a record majority unless the,73
NA,people of Australia had come to the well-,73
NA,founded conclusion that this Government,73
NA,was prepared to deal fairly by all sections,73
NA,of the community. One of the reasons,73
NA,why honorable gentlemen opposite are sit-,73
NA,ting where they are and in reduced num-,73
NA,bers is that they have not been able to,73
NA,absorb the spirit of the modern Australia,73
NA,and realize that Australians generally are,73
NA,sharing fairly in the national prosperity,73
NA,which our policies have at least been able,73
NA,to encourage.,73
NA,I have mentioned the criticism that has,73
NA,come from the spokesmen for industry to,73
NA,the effect that we have not done enough,73
NA,for them. It is true that in this Budget,73
NA,there is no substantial direct tax concession,73
NA,for industry. But there have been tax,73
NA,reductions for industry in earlier budgets.,73
NA,"I refer, for example, to the matter of",73
NA,depreciation allowances. I point out that,73
NA,"industry, as a whole, probably has never",73
NA,fared better than it has during this recent,73
NA,"period, largely because of a financial and",73
NA,economic environment which our policies,73
NA,have been able to foster. One point of,73
NA,evidence should suffice for me to make,73
NA,"my point. At the moment, I have an",73
NA,analysis for only the first nine months of,73
NA,"the last financial year, but I point out that",73
NA,public support for Australian industry by,73
NA,way of investment in one form or another,73
NA,"was 72 per cent, greater than for the pre-",73
NA,vious year. That certainly reflects not only,73
NA,"prosperity in industry, but faith in con-",73
NA,tinued prosperity on the part of the Aus-,73
NA,tralian investing public.,73
NA,"So, when all these criticisms are boiled",73
NA,"down, it is not surprising that the finance",73
NA,"editor of the Melbourne ""Herald"", of",73
NA,"Wednesday, 12th August, in an article",73
NA,"which included some criticism of his own,",73
NA,should say-,73
NA,The Budget leaves the Federal Treasury in the,73
NA,soundest financial position of any government,73
NA,"treasury in the world, and brands us inter-",74
NA,nationally as one of the soundest countries in,74
NA,the world financially.,74
NA,My only complaint is that the newspaper,74
NA,concerned tucked that comment away in,74
NA,relatively small print towards the end of,74
NA,"Mr Eddy's article. However, favorable",74
NA,comment in the United Kingdom press was,74
NA,"given quite wide publicity, and I do not",74
NA,need to refer to it. It may be of interest,74
NA,to honorable members to hear a comment,74
NA,"from New Zealand, our neighbour just",74
NA,across the water. The New Zealand,74
NA,""" Evening Post"", commenting on our",74
NA,"Budget, said this-",74
NA,A spirit of enterprise and expansion is abroad,74
NA,"in Australia, and it is reflected in the federal",74
NA,Budget and the comments which followed its,74
NA,presentation. It gives the distinct impression,74
NA,that Australia is forging ahead economically at,74
NA,"a tremendous rate. It is a brave Budget, too,",74
NA,"not in the sense of being unpopular, but because",74
NA,it recognizes frankly that the whole Australian,74
NA,economy these days is based upon the assumption,74
NA,"of strong, continuous growth.",74
NA,Even if Dr Evatt and Australian businessmen,74
NA,"do not agree with Mr Holt, there is much in his",74
NA,Budget about which we in New Zealand are,74
NA,entitled to feel some twinges of envy.,74
NA,Mr Reynolds - I can give the Minister,74
NA,some other comments about it.,74
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,Th e honorable,74
NA,member may have an opportunity at some,74
NA,time.,74
NA,"Let me turn for a few minutes, Sir, to",74
NA,some particular criticisms that have been,74
NA,made. The honorable member for St.,74
NA,"George ( Mr Clay), who preceded me, re-",74
NA,"ferred to pensions. No party, of course,",74
NA,has a monopoly of warm-heartedness in,74
NA,relation to what can be done or should be,74
NA,done for the aged and the infirm in our,74
NA,"community, and we, for our part, Sir, have",74
NA,a record in these matters which is un-,74
NA,matched in the history of the Australian,74
NA,federation. Honorable gentlemen opposite,74
NA,"have given us all sorts of criticisms, but the",74
NA,facts speak for themselves. When we took,74
NA,"office late in 1949, the Budget which had",74
NA,just been presented by the Labour Govern-,74
NA,ment provided a total of just on,74
NA,"Â£80,000,000 for social services and health",74
NA,services. Our Budget this year provides,74
NA,"just over Â£300,000,000 for national wel-",74
NA,fare and for health services. I admit,74
NA,quite frankly that there has been some,74
NA,"movement in prices since 1949, but it cer-",74
NA,tainly has not been of anything like the,74
NA,F.6207/59 -R -[28 ],74
NA,dimensions that the difference in propor-,74
NA,tions may suggest- a growth from,74
NA,"Â£80,000,000 under Labour to Â£300,000,000",74
NA,under this Government.,74
NA,NA,74
NA,only half as much as the same number of,74
NA,pounds would have bought in 1948.,74
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,Th e honorable,74
NA,"member may halve it, if he likes, but there",74
NA,is now just on four times the volume of,74
NA,expenditure that was provided in Labour's,74
NA,last Budget.,74
NA,I know that what we have proposed does,74
NA,not satisfy the pensioner organizations. It,74
NA,would be surprising if it did. But in every,74
NA,"Budget, we have tried to do a little more,",74
NA,and there has been this progressive increase,74
NA,in expenditure which I have mentioned.,74
NA,The pensioner organizations said that they,74
NA,wanted a pension equivalent to half the,74
NA,"basic wage, but it does not take very much",74
NA,thought to realize that if that principle,74
NA,were adopted many pensioner couples who,74
NA,were eligible also for income and property,74
NA,concessions under the provisions of our,74
NA,social services would be rather better off,74
NA,than were taxpayers who paid for the,74
NA,"pensioners' benefits, and I do not think that",74
NA,the request was very seriously pressed.,74
NA,"There have been others, Sir, who have said",74
NA,that pension rates should move in accord-,74
NA,ance with movements in the C series index,74
NA,"of retail prices. If we apply that test, the",74
NA,Government has nothing to be ashamed of.,74
NA,"After the provision made in this Budget,",74
NA,the general rate will be 15s. 5d. a week,74
NA,higher than the present-day equivalent of,74
NA,the 1949 rate obtained by applying the C,74
NA,series index. For pensioners eligible for,74
NA,supplementary assistance-an d those are,74
NA,the cases of greater hardship-th e total,74
NA,combined payment of pension and assist-,74
NA,ance will be Â£1 5s. 4d. a week more than,74
NA,the present-day equivalent of the 1949 rate,74
NA,-th e rate when Labour was in office-,74
NA,adjusted according to movements in the C,74
NA,series index of retail prices.,74
NA,But that is by no means the end of the,74
NA,story. There was no pensioner medical,74
NA,service in 1949. The pensioner had to pay,74
NA,for medical treatment and medicine. Since,74
NA,"1951, a .general practitioner service and a",74
NA,wide range of medicines have been pro-,74
NA,vided free of charge for the majority of,74
NA,"pensioners. Further, invalid and widow",74
NA,pensioners with children now receive an,75
NA,additional pension of 10s. a week for each,75
NA,"child under 16 years, except the first. No",75
NA,such supplement was paid in 1949. The,75
NA,means test has been liberalized in that the,75
NA,allowed income has been raised from,75
NA,Â£1 10s. to Â£3 10s. a week and the property,75
NA,"limit from Â£750 to Â£2,250 for a single pen-",75
NA,"sioner and from Â£1,500 to Â£4,500 for a",75
NA,pensioner married couple. A pension free,75
NA,of the means test was introduced for the,75
NA,"blind in October, 1952. Income from",75
NA,property has been disregarded since,75
NA,"October, 1954, in applying the income",75
NA,means test. These all are concessions and,75
NA,liberalizations which have occurred during,75
NA,the term of office of this Government and,75
NA,which did not apply while Labour was in,75
NA,office.,75
NA,"We have never felt, Sir, that although",75
NA,the Commonwealth has a substantial,75
NA,responsibility for our aged and infirm the,75
NA,responsibility should end there. It will be,75
NA,a bad day for Australia when there is no,75
NA,recognition that there is also a State respon-,75
NA,"sibility, which is exercised through the wel-",75
NA,fare organizations which each State,75
NA,"government has established, when there is",75
NA,"no sense of community responsibility and,",75
NA,"finally, when there is no sense of family",75
NA,"responsibility. What we, as a Common-",75
NA,"wealth Government, provide is a base for",75
NA,the pensioner to which the discharge of,75
NA,these other responsibilities can add its,75
NA,contribution.,75
NA,Then there was the attack that this Budget,75
NA,failed to provide for increased child endow-,75
NA,ment. That has been answered by many,75
NA,"previous speakers. After all, we introduced",75
NA,child endowment. In the teeth of Labour's,75
NA,"opposition, we extended it to the first child.",75
NA,But it was supporters of the Australian,75
NA,"Labour Party who, after the child endow-",75
NA,ment scheme had been put into operation,75
NA,"and was beingfinancedby the pay-roll tax,",75
NA,decided to alter the principle applied in,75
NA,the fixing of the basic wage. They have,75
NA,gone along to the industrial tribunals since,75
NA,the pay-roll tax was introduced to finance,75
NA,"child endowment, and have pressed the",75
NA,tribunals not to make provision for family,75
NA,"needs- I believe that, in the long run, that",75
NA,would have been a sounder approach-bu t,75
NA,to fix the highest basic wage that it is,75
NA,within the capacity of industry to pay.,75
NA,"Quite clearly, you cannot have it both ways.",75
NA,"Having the pay-roll tax, at a certain rate,",75
NA,levied on industry in order to finance child,75
NA,"endowment, you cannot ask the arbitra-",75
NA,tion tribunals to fix the highest basic wage,75
NA,that it is within the capacity of industry to,75
NA,"pay, and, at the same time, chide the",75
NA,Government because it is not able to get,75
NA,more from industry for the purpose of in-,75
NA,creasing child endowment. So I say that,75
NA,the critics of the present scheme would do,75
NA,well to look at their own policies and see,75
NA,whether they could usefully be overhauled.,75
NA,"I do not think it is necessary, Sir, to",75
NA,answer criticisms of the pharmaceutical,75
NA,benefits scheme that have been made. The,75
NA,proposed changes in the scheme have been,75
NA,well received by the public. I think that,75
NA,when we presented thefigureswhich showed,75
NA,how the number of prescriptions had grown,75
NA,"from 3,000,000 to more than 16,000,000",75
NA,a year and how the cost had increased,75
NA,"from Â£3,000,000 to Â£18,500,000 a year,",75
NA,there was a general realization that the,75
NA,position had to be stabilized. And the,75
NA,Government is setting about doing just that.,75
NA,"Another major criticism, in respect of",75
NA,which I do not want to take up the time,75
NA,"of the committee unnecessarily, is related",75
NA,"to postal charges. Fortunately, it is not so",75
NA,"necessary for me to deal with this, because",75
NA,"my colleague, the Postmaster-General ( Mr.",75
NA,"Davidson), will elaborate this matter in his",75
NA,second-reading speech on the legislation,75
NA,which will provide for the revised rates.,75
NA,I just want to make two or three points,75
NA,for the consideration of honorable gentle-,75
NA,"men opposite. Since World War IL, just",75
NA,"on Â£400,000,000 has been spent on capital",75
NA,items for the Post Office. The return from,75
NA,postal services has not represented anything,75
NA,like a normal interest return on that capital,75
NA,investment.,75
NA,"In one particular area, that of com-",75
NA,"mercial bulk postage, quite apart from any",75
NA,notional interest being introduced into the,75
NA,"calculations, the Post Office was losing",75
NA,millions of pounds a year. I think,75
NA,"Â£5,000,000 would have been the total over",75
NA,the whole area in the year just concluded.,75
NA,In the field in which there has been some,75
NA,"public controversy in recent days, had",75
NA,matters stood where they were there would,75
NA,"have been an operating loss of Â£3,000,000.",75
NA,"For example, it costs about 6d. to deliver,",75
NA,"under the bulk postage scheme, a periodical",75
NA,"or a newspaper, for which a charge of l i d .",75
NA,"is made. The Government, through the",76
NA,"Post Office, has virtually been subsidizing,",76
NA,"to the tune of about 5d. an article, the",76
NA,delivery _of commercial articles delivered,76
NA,as part of commercial services. I do not,76
NA,think anybody would regard that as reason-,76
NA,"able, or that the general taxpayer should",76
NA,"carry such a burden, when the consumer",76
NA,and the commercial operative might very,76
NA,well do so.,76
NA,I saw some rather flamboyant criticism,76
NA,"in one of the newspapers under the heading,",76
NA,""" Dial M for Murder."" Incidentally, I",76
NA,have discovered since taking over the,76
NA,Treasury that criticism can assume some,76
NA,"rather flamboyant forms. For instance,",76
NA,some character hung a red flag in a tree,76
NA,neaimy home in the dark of night some,76
NA,little time ago. I do not know whether,76
NA,that was a sign that I had produced a rich,76
NA,"man's Budget or the reverse. Again, a",76
NA,"package marked "" Fragile "" which was de-",76
NA,"livered to my wife over the week-end,",76
NA,contained a very old set of false teeth. I,76
NA,do not know what that was supposed to,76
NA,"signify. In any event, this newspaper",76
NA,"article, "" Dial M for Murder"", suggested",76
NA,that it costs the department only Â£9 for a,76
NA,"telephone, yet it charges this exorbitant",76
NA,annual rental. As my colleague knows-,76
NA,and the figures will be produced by him,76
NA,- i f you take into account the elements,76
NA,which a commercial organization would,76
NA,very properly take into account in the in-,76
NA,"stallation of a telephone, such as the ex-",76
NA,"change equipment, the underground cables,",76
NA,the cost of installation in the home as well,76
NA,"as the mechanism itself, you get a figure",76
NA,"of not Â£9 for that telephone, but Â£290.",76
NA,So when the facts can be presented-an d,76
NA,we have produced a few of them to-night-,76
NA,these things take on a very different aspect,76
NA,from that which our critics would present,76
NA,to the public.,76
NA,"Finally, let me say this: I indicated that",76
NA,we had achieved in this country a remark-,76
NA,"able degree of stability, unparalleled in",76
NA,"our history, economic, social, political and",76
NA,"industrial, which has left us most favorably",76
NA,placed to deal with the economic circum-,76
NA,stances of the future. Nothing which has,76
NA,been said in the course of this Budget,76
NA,debate has challenged that proposition.,76
NA,"Nobody can deny that these circumstances,",76
NA,"unrivalled in our own history and, I be-",76
NA,"live, unsurpassed anywhere else, exist in",76
NA,Australia to-day. So I say that the Budget-,76
NA,which has been produced will enable those,76
NA,favorable circumstances to continue. The,76
NA,judgment that should be applied to it is,76
NA,not a judgment made on the day after,76
NA,the Budget is announced. The real,76
NA,test should be applied on the eve of the,76
NA,next budget which will be introduced into,76
NA,this Parliament. I feel every confidence,76
NA,that when that time arrives I shall be able,76
NA,to say quite faithfully to this House that,76
NA,the Budget for 1959-60 assured Australia,76
NA,a prosperous year of expansion and de-,76
NA,"velopment, and gave to its people better",76
NA,living standards than they had known,76
NA,before.,76
NA,NA,76
NA,Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) has to-night,76
NA,defended himself against the critics of the,76
NA,Budget which was recently introduced into,76
NA,this Parliament. He told the Parliament,76
NA,"that the key-note, in effect, of the Budget",76
NA,was an attempt to hold costs and prices,76
NA,stable. But we are informed by one critic,76
NA,in this Parliament that between 1948-on e,76
NA,year before Labour left office-an d 1957,76
NA,"the official retail price indices covering food,",76
NA,"rent, clothing and miscellaneous household",76
NA,"expenditure, rose in Australia by 98 per",76
NA,"cent., representing an all-time record. This",76
NA,critic indicated that prices rose in that,76
NA,"period by only 50 per cent, in the United",76
NA,"Kingdom, where the economic position is",76
NA,and has been much more difficult to manage,76
NA,than ours. The relevant figure for Canada,76
NA,"was 26 per cent., for New Zealand 52 per",76
NA,"cent., for South Africa 43 per cent., and for",76
NA,the United States of America 18 per cent.,76
NA,"We are told by the present Treasurer, as",76
NA,is always the case when a Treasurer of this,76
NA,Government brings his Budget into the,76
NA,"Parliament, that the aim and objective of",76
NA,the Government has been to hold prices,76
NA,"stable and prevent inflation, but, as has",76
NA,been the case throughout the last ten,76
NA,"years, inflation has proceeded apace, and",76
NA,the position of the average citizens of this,76
NA,"country, particularly those receiving the",76
NA,"basic wage or a little more, has become",76
NA,"worse and worse. After all, as everybody",76
NA,"knows, inflation means ever-increasing",76
NA,prices for commodities that must neces-,76
NA,sarily be purchased by the people.,76
NA,Confirmation of my claim can be found,76
NA,in the report of an address delivered by,76
NA,"Dr Coombs, the Governor of the Com-",76
NA,"monwealth Bank, and reported in the",76
NA,"Melbourne "" Age "" of to-day. To be quite",77
NA,"fair, let me say that the report came",77
NA,"Perth, and I realize that it is possibly",77
NA,condensation of Dr Coombs's address.,77
NA,"However, he is reported to have said this-",77
NA,Inflation is a serious and growing threat,77
NA,health of our economy.,77
NA,"Well, who has managed the economy of",77
NA,"this country, untrammelled, for the past",77
NA,ten years? This Government took office,77
NA,"with a fanfare of trumpets, saying, "" We",77
NA,"will not only put value back into the Â£1,",77
NA,but we will even ensure that the Â£1,77
NA,have a higher purchasing power for the,77
NA,"people receiving social service benefits"".",77
NA,Nobodv can suggest that the Government,77
NA,is governing fairly and justly when con6,77
NA,sideration is given to the figures,77
NA,"will cite, and for which I am indebted to",77
NA,the speech of the honorable member for,77
NA,Yarra ( Mr Cairns).,77
NA,We find that in this current finanwe,77
NA,cial year the Government requires engage,77
NA,"Â£1,682,300,000 in cash- a lot of money",77
NA,-an d it expects to get by way of revenue,77
NA,not enough to meet that requirement. In,77
NA,"fact,, it expects to get Â£1,385,300,000.",77
NA,This is short of its requirements by,77
NA,"Â£297,000;000. The Government says lo",77
NA,"the people of Australia, "" We will borrow",77
NA,"Â£190,000,000 from the trading banks, and,",77
NA,"of course, we will pay them the prevailing",77
NA,"bank rates"". The Government will not",77
NA,"say to the trading banks, "" We will use our",77
NA,powers under the Banking Act to deter-,77
NA,"mine a rate of interest that is reasonable,",77
NA,considering the fact that this money,77
NA,required to finance the activities of,77
NA,"the Commonwealth Government"". The",77
NA,"Government tells the people, "" In addition,",77
NA,"we will issue Â£46,000,000, plus the amount",77
NA,"of our deficit, Â£61,000,000, to finance",77
NA,"activities, per medium of treasury-bills"".",77
NA,It gets the treasury-bills for about f per,77
NA,"cent, from its own Commonwealth Bank,",77
NA,and there is no reason why it should not,77
NA,"be compelled to get its Â£190,000,000",77
NA,the same rate instead of the higher preagain,77
NA,vailing bank rates.,77
NA,This is not the first time that we have,77
NA,had this deficit budgeting. It happened,77
NA,"last year, when the deficit was estimated",77
NA,"be Â£110,000,000. That sounds serious",77
NA,"and is serious, but does any one who reads",77
NA,in the daily press of the gigantic mergers,77
NA,of big businesses really beheve that there,77
NA,is any shortage of money or capacity to,77
NA,from pay increased taxes by those who have,77
NA,a waxed exceedingly rich and affluent during,77
NA,the ten years of mis-government by the,77
NA,Menzies-Fadden Administration? Look at,77
NA,to the the powerful commercial concerns that are,77
NA,trying to swallow each other. Do they,77
NA,want to swallow each other so that they,77
NA,can disgorge something to help the people,77
NA,or do they want to swallow each other so,77
NA,that they can strengthen their grip on Aus-,77
NA,tralia's economy and amass wealth for the,77
NA,will few people who direct them? The daily,77
NA,newspapers carry advertisements inserted,77
NA,"by hire-purchase companies and others,",77
NA,offering rates of interest that range from,77
NA,"per cent., 8 per cent, and 10 per cent,",77
NA,that 1 to even 15 per cent.,77
NA,We have a Treasurer who was one of,77
NA,the Heaven-sent geniuses of the Liberal,77
NA,"Party. But this year, as with last year,",77
NA,are told that the Government must,77
NA,in deficit financing. This deficit,77
NA,financing excuse is used to deprive people,77
NA,of the substantially higher social services,77
NA,payments that they are entitled to receive.,77
NA,The Treasurer comes into this chamber and,77
NA,"brags of the reduction in taxation, but",77
NA,these reductions mean that the man on the,77
NA,basic wage will get 18d. and I will get,77
NA,Â£25. Is that social justice? I get Â£25 a,77
NA,year out of this Budget on my taxable in-,77
NA,come and the less fortunate man on the,77
NA,basic wage gets about 18d. a week out of,77
NA,it. Is that not a pointer to the methods,77
NA,is used by this Government to finance its,77
NA,activities? But far worse than this is the,77
NA,Government's complete failure in the last,77
NA,three years to take the bit in its teeth and,77
NA,to do something about one aspect that,77
NA,our more than anything else is responsible for,77
NA,some of the difficulties that must be faced.,77
NA,The honorable member for Paterson,77
NA,"( Mr Fairhall) made a speech to-day, and I",77
NA,congratulate him. I do not often congratu-,77
NA,ai late my opponents and I will cut him down,77
NA,very shortly. I congratulate him for,77
NA,"pointing out to this Government, as I had",77
NA,"planned to do on somewhat different lines,",77
NA,that if this or any other government is,77
NA,to going to manage the affairs of the country,77
NA,"and control inflation effectively, it must",77
NA,control the marketing of Australia's annual,77
NA,"wool clip, if possible with the consent of",77
NA,-the growers. What are we confronted with,77
NA,here? We are confronted with this fact:,78
NA,"The 90,000 wool-growers in Australia-",78
NA,that is all there are-sen d their wool to,78
NA,the markets for sale. Every year in these,78
NA,markets they are the victims of the most,78
NA,capable and most highly organized set of,78
NA,"buyers and brokers to be found, probably,",78
NA,anywhere in the world. We have only,78
NA,about 150 of them and sometimes never,78
NA,"more, than 26 operate at the auction. When",78
NA,the wool-growers are in the hands of these,78
NA,"people, the nation also is in their hands.",78
NA,"I represent 66,000 people in my condangerous",78
NA,"stituency. Approximately 56,000 of them",78
NA,are basic wage and salary earners in our,78
NA,"industries. The other 10,000 are rural",78
NA,residents. There would not be more than,78
NA,"perhaps 1,000 wool-growers in the whole",78
NA,constituency. But when the gangsters-,78
NA,I should not call them that; perhaps-,78
NA,when the astute businessmen who buy wool,78
NA,for overseas interests control absolutely Australian,78
NA,the price that will be paid for that imbuyers,78
NA,"portant product, it is not the 1,000 woolwell-known",78
NA,growers but the men who work in,78
NA,Ferguson (Australia) Limited and in the,78
NA,other great industrial concerns in the,78
NA,stituency who suffer most.,78
NA,Mr Anthony -Ho w do you explain,78
NA,fact that the price goes up?,78
NA,NA,78
NA,that from time to time even these rings,78
NA,"buyers break down, and then the price rises.",78
NA,But I want to say this to the honorable,78
NA,gentleman: I will not be side-tracked,78
NA,I will tell him some of the history. In,78
NA,"1921, after World War I . , the wool, selling",78
NA,situation in this country was so serious,78
NA,some responsible people advocated dumpin,78
NA,"ing 1,700,000 bales of wool in the sea",78
NA,"because, they believed, it would never",78
NA,sold. An organization was created to,78
NA,"the surplus wool and, concurrently with",78
NA,the incoming clips. As a result of its,78
NA,"operations, protected from the price rigger,",78
NA,"the growers reaped a profit of Â£35,000,000.",78
NA,"Subsequently, the propaganda of the banks,",78
NA,"brokers and profiteers, who wanted",78
NA,"the wool-growers at their mercy again,",78
NA,convinced the growers that they should,78
NA,"vote out their own organization, and they",78
NA,"did so. The brokers said, in effect, that",78
NA,the price of wool would never again gp,78
NA,down to the disastrous level' that had,78
NA,"ruling after the war, but within three",78
NA,"months it went down by 30 per cent, and",78
NA,within six months it went down by 60 per,78
NA,cent. All these periodic flutters in the,78
NA,market do not mean very much.,78
NA,I advise my honorable friend to read the,78
NA,"copy of "" Muster"", published on 25th",78
NA,"August, 1959. "" Muster "" is the pastoralists'",78
NA,journal and in it we see the headline,78
NA,"""Russia's ' Mr Wool' Here"". All the",78
NA,pastoralists are happy because the Menzies,78
NA,Government approves of trade with these,78
NA,"Reds in. Russia, China and any-",78
NA,where else that there is money. The Labour,78
NA,Party advocates that we should trade with,78
NA,"every one, irrespective of political or reli-",78
NA,"gious outlook. The report in "" Muster """,78
NA,about a Russian official coming here-an d,78
NA,I will be brief with it-says -,78
NA,Since his arrival in Australia recently he has,78
NA,been preparing terms for Russian purchases of,78
NA,"wool, and arranging final details with",78
NA,he has selected in Australia.,78
NA,It is believed that these suppliers include the,78
NA,"wool firms, Dreyfus & Co., Kreglinger",78
NA,Masseyand Fernau and Prevost and Co.,78
NA,Let us have a look at these firms. Some of,78
NA,conthem were named in the inquiry held into,78
NA,wool sales by the New South Wales Indus-,78
NA,the trial Commission as people engaged in,78
NA,operating buyers' rings at the Sydney wool,78
NA,"markets. Before this inquiry, which was",78
NA,conducted by the Industrial Commission,78
NA,of appointed under the New South Wales,78
NA,"Monopolies Act, a wool buyer, Mr Rene",78
NA,"Moniez, is reported in the "" Sydney Morn-",78
NA,"but ing Herald "" of 13th November, 1958, as",78
NA,"having, said that he was in a "" pie "", which",78
NA,"is a buying group, with eight other wool-",78
NA,that buyers. Mr Moniez said that other buyers,78
NA,"the "" pie "" included L. H. Bell Proprie-",78
NA,"tary Limited, John Sanderson and Company",78
NA,"be (New South Wales) Proprietary Limited,",78
NA,sell and Kreglinger and Fernau (Australia),78
NA,"it, Proprietary Limited. Another firm is men-",78
NA,"tioned here also. This gentleman who, it",78
NA,"is believed, will buy wool for the Russians",78
NA,belongs to a buyers' pie. That fact was,78
NA,revealed before the royal commission to,78
NA,to have which I have referred.,78
NA,"What is a "" buyers' pie""? Buying",78
NA,"brokers get together and they say, ""Don't",78
NA,"be foolish, boys; let us all go down to the",78
NA,"sales but only one of us bid, and we can",78
NA,"been split up thelots afterwards"". That is",78
NA,rather a natural thing to do. But in this,78
NA,country there is no corresponding orga-,79
NA,"nization on the selling end, and the end",79
NA,result is that this nation suffers. I men-,79
NA,tioned that after World War I . we had a,79
NA,buyer-selling organization for the growers,79
NA,called British Australian Wool Realiza-,79
NA,tion Association which sold the war-time,79
NA,"surplus of 1,700,000 bales, or thereabouts.",79
NA,About one-fifth of the surplus left over,79
NA,after World War II . had to be sold under,79
NA,a similar organization. It is a remarkable,79
NA,thing that when there is a surplus which,79
NA,clearly represents a danger to the wool-,79
NA,"growers, the commercial men get together,",79
NA,as wei! as the brokers and the conserva-,79
NA,"tive politicians, and approve of something",79
NA,being -'lone about it. But when the moun-,79
NA,tain of wool disappears and the immediate,79
NA,"danger passes, they want to open the way",79
NA,for the speculator again.,79
NA,I will not traverse the history of,79
NA,"B.A.W.R.A.. because it is long, but it was",79
NA,"a successful organization, and sold for the",79
NA,"growers of this country Â£35,000,000-worth",79
NA,"of wool when other people said, ""Dump",79
NA,"it, because you will not be able to get",79
NA,"rid of it"". At the end of World War II . ,",79
NA,"there were 10,000,000 surplus bales of",79
NA,wool in England which had been supplied,79
NA,"by South Africa, New Zealand, the TJnited",79
NA,Kingdom and Australia. The Labour go-,79
NA,vernment of the day agreed to buy a 50,79
NA,"per cent, interest in the Australian portion",79
NA,"of the surplus, amounting to 7,000,000-odd",79
NA,bales. It agreed to form an approved,79
NA,"organization to be known as ""J.O."". It",79
NA,"was believed that to sell those 10,000,000",79
NA,surplus bales of wool would take from ten,79
NA,to fourteen years. But the market proved,79
NA,"buoyant and that wool was sold, together",79
NA,"with the incoming wool clips, within",79
NA,years.,79
NA,That scheme was backed by the Coming,79
NA,monwealth Labour Government under the,79
NA,leadership of Mr Curtin and Mr Chifley.,79
NA,The end result was that because a reserve,79
NA,price was fixed by agreement between,79
NA,"South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and",79
NA,"the United Kingdom, a profit of more",79
NA,"Â£99,000,000 was made out of that transappoint",79
NA,"action. Of that sum, Â£40,000.000 or",79
NA,"Â£50,000,000, for which the Commonwealth",79
NA,taxpayers were committed and which could,79
NA,"have been lost, was paid out. It was really",79
NA,"only a sum to be drawn on, but it was safe",79
NA,and the Australian wool-grower received ing of wool clips.,79
NA,the proceeds from the sale of that surplus,79
NA,wool which he had already been paid for.,79
NA,Let us trace the subsequent history of,79
NA,wool. There was a movement among the,79
NA,growers to get a similar organization to,79
NA,"protect future wool clips, but it was de-",79
NA,stroyed. I make that charge with a full,79
NA,sense of responsibility. I believe it was,79
NA,destroyed wilfully by the then Treasurer,79
NA,of the Menzies Government. How was it,79
NA,destroyed? It was agreed among the,79
NA,growers' organizations that a poll be taken,79
NA,regarding the new set-up which was to bs,79
NA,very similar to the successful one which had,79
NA,ended its work. The Menzies Government,79
NA,had just obtained an agreement with South,79
NA,"Africa, New Zealand and the United King-",79
NA,dom for a similar scheme to proceed.,79
NA,"Then, in the 1950-51 Budget it imposed a",79
NA,"tax of l i per cent, on the gross sales of all",79
NA,wool sold in Australia in order to raise the,79
NA,finance necessary to work the new scheme.,79
NA,I do not think the growers worried much,79
NA,"about that, but the Government imposed",79
NA,"a further 20 per cent, deduction from the",79
NA,gross wool cheques of every wool-grower,79
NA,"in Australia, and the brokers, the buyers,",79
NA,"the banks, commercial interests in this",79
NA,country and a whole lot of people who had,79
NA,more interest in commercial transactions,79
NA,than in wool and not much interest in the,79
NA,"welfare of their country, launched propa-",79
NA,"ganda for a "" No "" vote, and unfortunately",79
NA,the growers voted out that scheme. They,79
NA,"believed that if they voted it in, they would",79
NA,"lose 2 H per cent, of their wool cheque each",79
NA,year.,79
NA,But time marches on. That was in 1951.,79
NA,Since then the position of wool has become,79
NA,"five serious. In 1957-58, during one period",79
NA,of twelve months the return from wool in,79
NA,"Australia dropped by Â£100,000,000. Dur-",79
NA,this last twelve months it dropped,79
NA,"Â£71,000,000. Hence, the Government has",79
NA,been faced with difficulties and many other,79
NA,people in this country are suffering. The,79
NA,honorable member for Paterson ( Mr.,79
NA,"Fairhall), in his excellent speech this aftei-",79
NA,"than noon, urged that the Government should",79
NA,a royal commission to inquire into,79
NA,the problems of wool selling and the pro-,79
NA,motion of the use of wool. I do not want,79
NA,"to do the honorable member an injustice,",79
NA,but I do not think he intended that the,79
NA,royal commission should cover the market-,79
NA,Mr Turnbull -H e said that.,80
NA,NA,80
NA,he did.,80
NA,Mr Turnbull -H e said it.,80
NA,NA,80
NA,"it, but he can speak for himself. The",80
NA,honorable member for Mallee can speak,80
NA,"for himself, too. Over the last twelve",80
NA,months there has been a lot of propaganda,80
NA,in this country on the question of the fall,80
NA,in wool prices. It is noteworthy that the,80
NA,conservative interests among the wool-,80
NA,"growers, their henchmen and those who",80
NA,pull the strings among the buying groups,80
NA,"of brokers, as well as other interested parties",80
NA,-an d some of them ought to know better,80
NA,-hav e been trying to make wool-growers,80
NA,believe that the real problem is one of,80
NA,sales promotion-gettin g buyers for the,80
NA,"wool. That is important, and I agree with",80
NA,most of what the honorable member for,80
NA,"Paterson said. However, I say very em-",80
NA,phatically that what is needed immediately,80
NA,is some means of matching the skill of the,80
NA,overseas buyer and his brokers and repre-,80
NA,sentatives in this country- a selling,80
NA,organization which this Government ought,80
NA,to be sponsoring for the growers. Until the,80
NA,"Government does that, all promotion ac-",80
NA,tivities will go by the board. Any one,80
NA,would think that in every year of the last,80
NA,ten years a wool surplus had been banking,80
NA,up in Australia and that we could not get,80
NA,rid of it. The plain fact is that with the,80
NA,"exception of about 60,000 or 70,000 bales",80
NA,"at the end of every selling season, and the",80
NA,"exception also of the war time period, the",80
NA,whole wool clip has been cleared each year.,80
NA,The outstanding problem is to get a price,80
NA,for it.,80
NA,"These are the facts, but they do not",80
NA,count for a moment the need to launch,80
NA,promotion drive with sales talk to teach,80
NA,people the virtues of wool and encourage,80
NA,them to buy it. But when the honorable,80
NA,member urges the Government to appoint,80
NA,a royal commission to inquire into sales,80
NA,"promotion methods and so on, I think",80
NA,indulging in the same sort of talk that,80
NA,coming from other interests in this counoperating,80
NA,try in an effort to divert the minds of,80
NA,wool-growers from the very real immediate,80
NA,"problem, which is the price of wool.",80
NA,Mr Killen -I t was a very good,80
NA,suggestion.,80
NA,NA,80
NA,ber says it was a good suggestion. Any,80
NA,intelligent Cabinet Minister could gather,80
NA,around him within a reasonable period all,80
NA,the experts on sales promotion that this,80
NA,country has-an d some of them are pretty,80
NA,good. On television one sees these experts,80
NA,engaged in all sorts of sales promotion. I,80
NA,"think of the "" Four and Twenty Blackbirds """,80
NA,unit. They give all sorts of commercial pep,80
NA,talks. Surely the advertising of wool either,80
NA,at home or abroad does not require an,80
NA,inquiry by a royal commission in order to,80
NA,launch a sales promotion drive. Such an,80
NA,inquiry would only cause delay.,80
NA,The constitution of the Australian Wool,80
NA,Bureau is in question. I have some sym-,80
NA,pathy with the point of view of the honor-,80
NA,"able member for Paterson, but do not let",80
NA,us be deluded about the other important,80
NA,question of getting hold of the marketing,80
NA,end. What did the late William Morris,80
NA,Hughes do in 1921 when the wool industry,80
NA,"went to him and said, ""The price of wool",80
NA,is down to 6d. a lb.; we want you to do,80
NA,"something about it""? He drafted regula-",80
NA,"tions under the Customs Act, I think, which",80
NA,prescribed that no wool was to be allowed,80
NA,to leave this country under what was then,80
NA,considered to be the bare cost of produc-,80
NA,"tion, namely, 9d. per lb. Areserveprice",80
NA,was to be declared from time to time. Im-,80
NA,"mediately, the people who had been bidding",80
NA,6d. per lb. lifted their bids to over 9d.,80
NA,Some people say that was a purely for-,80
NA,"tuituous circumstance, but the fact remains",80
NA,that the regulation was effective. Until,80
NA,"some drastic action is taken, we shall be",80
NA,"fools in the eyes of the world, because, as",80
NA,the producers of a great product-th e world,80
NA,dishas proved it wants our wool because it,80
NA,a takes it every year-w e do not have sense,80
NA,enough to take steps to have an effective,80
NA,say in the price paid for it.,80
NA,Any man who says that we should ask,80
NA,outrageous prices ought to be examined,80
NA,"mentally, but we have the Bureau of Agri-",80
NA,"he is cultural Economics, estabhshed by a",80
NA,"is Labour Government, which has been",80
NA,for the last ten years. It has,80
NA,the earned the admiration of the whole world,80
NA,by the soundness of its findings. The,80
NA,bureau is capable of telling us the average,80
NA,cost of production of wool. It can assess,81
NA,the cost of production of a highly efficient,81
NA,producer and that of a less efficient pro-,81
NA,ducer and take an average. That infor-,81
NA,mation could be utilized in a pricing,81
NA,"method, or in some other way of dealing",81
NA,"with this very vital and, I believe, im-",81
NA,mediate problem.,81
NA,I want to add a few words about postal,81
NA,charges. I have not time to say very,81
NA,"much, but I do say that it is a well-known",81
NA,fact that from 1901 to 1945 the Post Office,81
NA,paid for all of its capital requirements,81
NA,of its earnings. It is true that since 1945,81
NA,capital works have been provided for out,81
NA,"of Consolidated Revenue, but apparently",81
NA,there has been no very effective bookwas,81
NA,keeping system by which the actual Interest,81
NA,obligations of the Post Office in respect,81
NA,of its more recently borrowed money and,81
NA,in respect of the valuation of its capital,81
NA,property can be ascertained. The Post,81
NA,Office does not seem to have any effective,81
NA,knowledge of these things.,81
NA,It is quite true that at the moment,81
NA,"Post Office is losing some money, but",81
NA,also true that it is unjust to raise extra,81
NA,revenue to meet losses incurred by the,81
NA,Office when a major portion of those losses,81
NA,"is due to the fact that this Government,",81
NA,"and all other governments, as a matter",81
NA,"of policy, have laid it down that country",81
NA,"residents shall have mail deliveries,",81
NA,"phone services, telegraphic services",81
NA,other public services at far below cost.,81
NA,Are we now to tolerate a Government,81
NA,in order to recoup the cost of the services Australian.,81
NA,that have been given to people in isolated,81
NA,"areas, as a matter of pohcy, is going to",81
NA,"load that cost on to, for instance, the",81
NA,humble suburban householder who has a,81
NA,telephone? The husband may be away,81
NA,from home all day. If he is a member,81
NA,"of Parliament, he may be away for a week.",81
NA,Are we to load on to telephone users,81
NA,"the city and, Tjy the same rule, on to",81
NA,"phone users in the country, an obligation",81
NA,"that, in view of the policy of assisting",81
NA,"people of the outback, should properly",81
NA,"discharged from Consolidated Revenue,",81
NA,which every itaxpayer contributes on,81
NA,equitable basis? That .is the place to put,81
NA,the burden. The ;present proposals are,81
NA,just because they penalize non-profit-makmoment,81
NA,"ing organizations, such as religious, sportthat",81
NA,ing and other bodies.,81
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN , ( Mr.,81
NA,Wight) -Order ! The honorable member's,81
NA,time has expired.,81
Mr BRIMBLECOMBE ,Maranoa),81
NA,"[9.24] -A t this late stage, when the Budget",81
NA,"debate is drawing to a conclusion, I want,",81
NA,"first of all, to offer my congratulations to",81
NA,the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) on the,81
NA,presentation of his first Budget in this,81
NA,"chamber. I intend, however, despite the",81
NA,"second speech he has delivered, to offer",81
NA,some criticisms of certain matters con-,81
NA,out tained in that Budget.,81
NA,I think this is an appropriate occasion,81
NA,"to pay a tribute to Sir Arthur Fadden, who",81
NA,the Treasurer of this country for so,81
NA,"many years, and who played a very big part",81
NA,in bringing about the sound economic con-,81
NA,ditions which this country enjoys to-day. I,81
NA,think it should be put on record that he,81
NA,played a major part in placing the economy,81
NA,of Australia on a very sound basis. I think,81
NA,it is worth recalling to the minds of some of,81
NA,the younger people in the community that,81
NA,the when he introduced some of his early,81
NA,"it is Budgets, which I well remember, he was",81
NA,criticized by all sections of the people from,81
NA,"Post one side of the country to the other, so",81
NA,much so that at one period he said that he,81
NA,could entertain the only friends he had left,81
NA,"in a telephone box! However, as time went",81
NA,"on, he was proved to be right, and I think",81
NA,telethe great majority of the people of Aus-,81
NA,and tralia now are prepared to say that what,81
NA,Sir Arthur Fadden did was in the interests,81
NA,"that, of his country and that he is a great",81
NA,The honorable member for Lalor ( Mr.,81
NA,Pollard) gave us a dissertation on the posi-,81
NA,tion of the wool industry as he saw it. His,81
NA,speech was in contrast with those made,81
NA,earlier by the honorable member for Pater-,81
NA,son ( Mr Fairhall) and the honorable mem-,81
NA,in ber for St. George ( Mr Clay). They dis-,81
NA,telecussed this matter with a view to advising,81
NA,the people of Australia of what would,81
NA,happen to the country and the great,81
NA,be majority of the workers if the wool market,81
NA,to collapsed any further than it has done in,81
NA,an recent months. I think they did a duty,81
NA,"to their country by stating the facts, and the",81
NA,unpeople of Australia should pause for a,81
NA,to think of the dire circumstances,81
NA,would arise if the wool industry were,81
NA,to go to the wall.,81
NA,"I recall that, not many years ago, when",82
NA,woolgrowers were enjoying high prices for,82
NA,"their wool, they did not receive any sym-",82
NA,pathy from a number of Labour members,82
NA,of this Parliament. I can remember speak-,82
NA,"ing, on this subject in the House. I spoke",82
NA,as the representative of one of the biggest,82
NA,fine woolgrowing electorates in the Com-,82
NA,"monwealth. As a matter of fact, over half",82
NA,"of the sheep in Queensland-11,000,00 0",82
NA,of them-ar e in my electorate. When I,82
NA,"spoke on behalf of the woolgrowers, I was",82
NA,"chided for being parochial, and I was told",82
NA,that I was always looking after the great,82
NA,wool and beef barons. I was chided with,82
NA,"that, and the record can be seen in",82
NA,""" Hansard "". To-day we find that honor-",82
NA,able members opposite are talking in a diff-,82
NA,erent strain. I do not include the honor-,82
NA,able member for St. George in what I am,82
NA,"going to say, because he has already",82
NA,demonstrated that he can see the dangers,82
NA,ahead if any further calamity happens to,82
NA,the wool industry.,82
NA,Members of the Opposition are now dis-,82
NA,playing great sympathy and telling this Go-,82
NA,"vernment, quite rightly, that it should do",82
NA,something to rectify the position. It is,82
NA,their duty to do that sort of thing if they,82
NA,think it is in the interests of the nation.,82
NA,But they should be consistent. The pro-,82
NA,duction of the wool industry is subject to,82
NA,the vagaries of the seasons to a very great,82
NA,extent. The industry also relies on the,82
NA,"auction system, which the growers them-",82
NA,selves have decided they want. The Go-,82
NA,vernment adopts the attitude that if the,82
NA,"growers want a free auction system, they",82
NA,shall have it. It is their product and they,82
NA,should decide the best method for its dis-,82
NA,posal. The honorable member for Lalor,82
NA,has claimed that some of the buyers rig,82
NA,the sales and that a free auction system,82
NA,does not exist. He has said that the buyers,82
NA,go to the sales and make one bid. My,82
NA,"colleague, the honorable member for",82
NA,"Mallee ( Mr Turnbull), has reminded me",82
NA,that the infamous Newmarket one^bid,82
NA,auction was introduced by the Labour,82
NA,Party. What reply can the honorable,82
NA,member for Lalor make to that assertion?,82
NA,During his speech he did not say one word,82
NA,about what that system has cost the primary,82
NA,producers.,82
NA,He said that the Labour Party would,82
NA,trade with any country irrespective of the,82
NA,religious beliefs and political views of. its,82
NA,people. I remind him of the attitude,82
NA,adopted by the Labour Party when this,82
NA,Government announced its intention to,82
NA,enter into a trade agreement with Japan.,82
NA,The Labour Party opposed the move very,82
NA,vigorously and voted against it in this,82
NA,House. How can the honorable member,82
NA,reconcile that fact with his statement to-,82
NA,night that the Labour Party is prepared,82
NA,"to trade with all and sundry, whether it is",82
NA,"red China, Russia or any other ountry?",82
NA,The Labour Party should be consistent in,82
NA,its attitude.,82
NA,I should like to comment on the pro-,82
NA,posal to reduce income tax by 5 per cent.,82
NA,I join with the honorable member for,82
NA,Canning ( Mr Hamilton) in saying that the,82
NA,reduction will be of advantage to only a,82
NA,very small minority of the people. The,82
NA,proposal will benefit those who have assets,82
NA,and will give nothing to those whose income,82
NA,is so low that they are not liable to be,82
NA,taxed. I refer in particular to the great,82
NA,majority of the people whom I represent.,82
NA,One has only to look at the figures to see,82
NA,how income from primary industries has,82
NA,been falling and how costs have been,82
NA,rising. Although the total income from,82
NA,1956-57 to 1958-59 has remained fairly,82
NA,"static, costs in the form of wages, depre-",82
NA,ciation and other charges have risen con-,82
NA,siderably. I venture to say that the great,82
NA,free majority of primary producers will not be,82
NA,"liable for income tax in any case, so they",82
NA,will not receive any benefit from the pro-,82
NA,posed reduction of 5 per cent.,82
NA,I should like to refer now to postal,82
NA,charges. Of all the Ministers who have,82
NA,"participated in this debate, only the Prime",82
NA,"Minister ( Mr Menzies), the Treasurer and",82
NA,the Minister for Supply ( Mr Hulme) have,82
NA,made any reference to this very conten-,82
NA,tious matter. The Prime Minister has,82
NA,announced that some alteration will be,82
NA,made in the bulk postage rates. The,82
NA,"Minister for Supply, in a very brief refer-",82
NA,"ence to the subject, made a poor defence",82
NA,of the proposal to increase the postal rates.,82
NA,The Government would be wise to recon-,82
NA,sider its proposal. I make that statement,82
NA,after having given some thought to the,82
NA,subject. During the last few years I have,82
NA,made it my business to study the operations,82
NA,of the various sections of the Post Office.,82
NA,I have found that senior officers have been,82
NA,able to effect many economies in all,83
NA,branches. During his Budget speech the,83
NA,"Treasurer, referring to the efficiency of the",83
NA,"organization, said-",83
NA,We all know it to be a highly competent,83
NA,"organization-efficientl y managed, devoted to the",83
NA,"service of the public, progressive iu its outlook,",83
NA,eager to meet the ever-increasing demands upon,83
NA,"it for wider and better facilities, lt has had",83
NA,success in this; it has made really great headway,83
NA,in providing Australia with an adequate and up-,83
NA,to-date communications system.,83
NA,I know that statement to be true because 1,83
NA,have investigated the operations of the Post,83
NA,Office. I have visited practically all the,83
NA,large post offices in Australia as well as,83
NA,"many of the smaller establishments, and I",83
NA,have talked with the employees in those,83
NA,places. A committee wiil investigate the,83
NA,capitalization of the Post Office and express,83
NA,it in proper accounting terms. If that com-,83
NA,mittee reports that there is no justification,83
NA,"for the increased charges, I wonder wheth :r",83
NA,the Government will reduce thern. I sup-,83
NA,"pose that, in this instance, any reduction",83
NA,could not be made retrospective.,83
NA,It has been suggested that losses have been,83
NA,sustained by various sections of the Post-,83
NA,master-General's Department. [ agree that,83
NA,there may have been losses in terms of,83
NA,"pounds, shillings and pence, but how can",83
NA,one place a monetary value on the service,83
NA,that the Post Office has given to the people,83
NA,"of Australia, particularly those in the",83
NA,country areas? The Government has a,83
NA,duty to provide services for the people who,83
NA,are prepared to pioneer the outback. Un-,83
NA,less they are given some of the amenities of,83
NA,city life-an d postal and telephone ser-,83
NA,vices are what may be called an essential,83
NA,amenity in the country areas-ho w can the,83
NA,Government expect them to go into the wide,83
NA,open spaces?,83
NA,Every day we read and we hear that it is,83
NA,essential that we produce more and reduce,83
NA,"costs. Industries, particularly primary in-",83
NA,"dustries, in the electorate which I repre-",83
NA,sent are very conscious of the fact that costs,83
NA,must be reduced if vve are to compete in,83
NA,overseas markets. But the manufacturers,83
NA,and the primary producers have no control,83
NA,over the majority of the costs that they must,83
NA,"bear, and this Budget has not given them",83
NA,a lead as to the way in which the question,83
NA,should be approached.,83
NA,I shall state briefly my view on how,83
NA,duction costs may be reduced. First and,83
NA,"foremost, transport costs should be re-",83
NA,viewed. Jf there were some co-ordination,83
NA,between the transport services of the,83
NA,"various States, these costs could be reduced",83
NA,materially. Transport represents between,83
NA,"20 per cent, and 30 per cent, of the cost",83
NA,of primary production. Another way to,83
NA,notable reduce production costs is to assist people,83
NA,engaged in primary industry to obtain up-,83
NA,to-date equipment and thus produce more,83
NA,efficiently. I have in mind especially those,83
NA,who have commenced operations within,83
NA,the last eight or nine years. In my own,83
NA,area those people are well and truly up,83
NA,against it in obtaining finance for modern,83
NA,equipment and taking advantage of the,83
NA,new techniques made available by the,83
NA,Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial,83
NA,"Research Organization. Of course, I am",83
NA,living in hope that the proposed Common-,83
NA,"wealth Development Bank of Australia,",83
NA,"which will commence operations next year,",83
NA,will be able to provide the necessary credit,83
NA,for this purpose nnd for other essential,83
NA,purposes. At present it is difficult to obtain,83
NA,"finance from the trading banks, which",83
NA,prefer to invest in avenues offering quicker,83
NA,returns.,83
NA,Until recent years it was the practice,83
NA,"for the country storekeeper, and the stock",83
NA,"and station agent, to act as a sort of",83
NA,banker for the farmer to carry him over,83
NA,the seasonal period. They could obtain,83
NA,short term credit with which to buy the,83
NA,whole of the sacks or fertilizer needed in a,83
NA,district and could extend similar credit to,83
NA,the primary producers using them. Such,83
NA,short-term credits are no longer available.,83
NA,Their withdrawal is retarding production,83
NA,and is imposing a great handicap on pri-,83
NA,mary producers.,83
NA,At present a convention of scientists is,83
NA,being held in Perth. Once again we have,83
NA,been told that there is a dearth of able,83
NA,scientists in Australia. I shall mention,83
NA,"only one group, for whose services pri-",83
NA,mary industry is crying out. I refer to the,83
NA,aericultural scientists. Why are they not,83
NA,available in greater numbers? Facilities,83
NA,for training young people are provided at,83
NA,"the universities, but pupils are not coming",83
NA,forward for training. When the agricul-,83
NA,tural scientist has taken his degree and,83
NA,progoes out on probation he is paid less than,83
NA,is a plumber. He is the lowest paid of all,83
NA,"scientists, yet this country depends upon",84
NA,the sale of primary produce for the over-,84
NA,seas credit that it needs if it is to buy the,84
NA,material which keeps secondary industry,84
NA,going.,84
NA,Mr Clyde Cameron -Whos e fault is,84
NA,that?,84
Mr BRIMBLECOMBE ,"I t is our fault,",84
NA,and doubtless when Labour was in office,84
NA,it made the same mistake. I ask the Go-,84
NA,vernment to grant more scholarships for,84
NA,work in this faculty; to make the associated,84
NA,grant more liberal; and to ensure that the,84
NA,probationer is given adequate remuneration.,84
NA,It may be said that I have an axe to grind,84
NA,in bringing forward this matter. Indeed I,84
NA,have. Almost all the members of my,84
NA,family are agricultural scientists. They,84
NA,are leaving their government employment,84
NA,because they do not receive sufficient,84
NA,remuneration to make it worth their while,84
NA,to remain. They could make more outside,84
NA,"with private enterprise, or by simply going",84
NA,on the land. Australia cannot afford to,84
NA,"lose agricultural scientists, who are the",84
NA,link between the producers and the sales,84
NA,end. We must encourage them in every,84
NA,way possible. I plead with the Government,84
NA,to look at this matter and ensure that these,84
NA,people are given a decent position in the,84
NA,"list of scientists, which is a very long",84
NA,At present they are at the bottom and there,84
NA,are available very few to fill the positions,84
NA,that are vacant.,84
NA,"Trade is the life blood of this country,",84
NA,and the Minister for Trade ( Mr MCEwen),84
NA,has done a mighty job in promoting,84
NA,"overseas. I recall that, some years ago, he",84
NA,warned Australia that we must encourage,84
NA,our secondary industries because we could,84
NA,not live for ever on our earnings from,84
NA,mary industry. He has done everything in,84
NA,his power to attain that end. We of the,84
NA,Australian Country Party believe that,84
NA,proper balance should be maintained now,84
NA,between the primary and secondary indus-,84
NA,tries. We believe that the home market,84
NA,"the best market, but we have not forgotten",84
NA,that the export market is the most important,84
NA,for the maintenance of this country's,84
NA,economic stability.,84
Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,Hindmarsh) made,84
NA,[9.49] - I think that I ought to tell any,84
NA,who may have been listening to the honorcountry.,84
NA,able member for Maranoa ( Mr Brimble-,84
NA,combe) that he is normally a supporter of,84
NA,the Government. He is an Australian,84
NA,Country Party representative and his party,84
NA,alone is responsible for keeping in office,84
NA,this Government-whic h he has criticized,84
NA,"so correctly, and with such justification.",84
NA,"Indeed, it is his party alone that makes it",84
NA,possible for the Government to increase,84
NA,postal charges in the way that he has,84
NA,criticized. It is the Australian Country,84
NA,Party alone which is responsible for this,84
NA,Government being able to make tremendous,84
NA,reductions in tax on high incomes-givin g,84
NA,practically no benefit to the smaller income-,84
NA,earners whom he mentioned when referring,84
NA,to the primary producers. It is perfectly,84
NA,"correct, as the honorable member said,",84
NA,that there are very few primary producers,84
NA,to-day who will get any benefit at all from,84
NA,the reduction in income tax that is pro-,84
NA,posed in this Government's Budget. On,84
NA,"the other hand, people living in the capital",84
NA,cities who own large parcels of shares in,84
NA,the big concerns which manufacture the,84
NA,things that the primary producer has to,84
NA,buy at a price fixed arbitrarily by the manu-,84
NA,"facturing combines themselves, will have the",84
NA,lion's share of the reduction.,84
NA,If the members on the Government side,84
NA,list. of the chamber who have criticized this,84
NA,Budget in the same way as the Opposition,84
NA,"has criticized it vote, in a few minutes'",84
NA,"time, in accordance with the way in which",84
NA,"they have spoken, the Budget will be re-",84
NA,jected and this Government will have to,84
NA,"face another general election. Of course,",84
NA,it although some honorable members oppo-,84
NA,site often speak against things that the Go-,84
NA,"vernment does, they can always be relied",84
NA,upon to vote for the Government when ita,84
NA,prifate is likely to be in the balance.,84
NA,Whilst it is pleasing to know that some,84
NA,a members of both Government parties are,84
NA,agreeing with the criticisms which the,84
NA,Opposition has levelled against this rich,84
NA,"man's Budget, it would be very much more",84
NA,is pleasing if we could see them match their,84
NA,words with deeds and vote against the,84
NA,Government when the division bells cease,84
NA,ringing and the count of heads takes place.,84
NA,The honorable member for Maranoa,84
NA,yet another important point when he,84
NA,one said that trade is the life blood of this,84
NA,There is no doubt that trade,84
NA,is the life blood of a country.,85
NA,Any government that knows its respon-,85
NA,sibility to its people ought to do every-,85
NA,thing possible to expand trade.,85
NA,"agree that a country should not, of course,",85
NA,send to countries that may become,85
NA,"enemies, strategic raw materials or materials",85
NA,that could be turned into war goods. On,85
NA,"the other hand, I cannot understand the",85
NA,double talk of members of the Liberal Party,85
NA,and Australian Country Party when they,85
NA,"pretend on the one hand, that they are op-",85
NA,"posed to trade with China, but, on the other",85
NA,"hand, do not oppose trade with red Russia.",85
NA,"They are opposed to recognizing red China,",85
NA,yet they are quite prepared to recognize,85
NA,red Russia!,85
NA,The honorable member for Hume ( Mr.,85
NA,Anderson) who is interjecting knows that,85
NA,he sold his wool to red Russia at a time,85
NA,when it seemed that wool would be a very,85
NA,important factor in a war which the Go-,85
NA,vernment had told us was only three years,85
NA,away. This honorable member who always,85
NA,has so much to say about not recognizing,85
NA,"red China, sold his wool to red Russia for",85
NA,no better reason than that red Russia was,85
NA,able to pay him a few pence per pound,85
NA,more for it than anybody else was willing,85
NA,to pay. The primary factor in the honor-,85
NA,"able member's mind was not any "" hi-",85
NA,"falutin "" principle about recognizing Com-",85
NA,"munist countries, but the question of how",85
NA,much more money he could get by selling,85
NA,to red Russia- a country which his own,85
NA,"Prime Minister had told him, in 1951,",85
NA,would be at war with us within three years.,85
NA,That illustrates the kind of split principle,85
NA,that seems to be applied in this question of,85
NA,the recognition of red China.,85
NA,Although the Government talks a lot,85
NA,"about refusing to recognize red China, the",85
NA,Minister for Trade ( Mr MCEwen) has told,85
NA,us that it is now quite in order to sell not,85
NA,only wool and foodstuffs but also steel to,85
NA,red China. This indicates how strong are the,85
NA,Government's moral objections to trade,85
NA,with Communist countries. Its excuse for,85
NA,permitting our potential enemies in the Com-,85
NA,munist world to be supplied with vital war,85
NA,"materials is in effect, "" If we do not give",85
NA,"the Communists steel, some other country",85
NA,"will, so we might as well join in the bean-",85
NA,"feast and get our cut of the profit"".. The",85
NA,"prime consideration of these people, all the",85
NA,"time, is not some high principle but the",85
NA,"question, "" How much money can we get",85
NA,in our own pockets from the transaction we,85
NA,"now contemplate? """,85
NA,I The difference between the policy of the,85
NA,Government and that of the Labour Party,85
NA,is that we are honest. We agree with the,85
NA,honorable member for Maranoa when he,85
NA,says that trade is the life blood of the,85
NA,country. We believe it is proper to trade,85
NA,with the countries of the world irrespective,85
NA,of their kind of government. I do not,85
NA,criticize the honorable member for Hume,85
NA,for having sold his wool to red Russia at a,85
NA,time when war seemed to be inevitable; but,85
NA,I do not like to hear the honorable mem-,85
NA,ber criticizing the Opposition simply be-,85
NA,cause it is honest enough to say that we,85
NA,ought to trade with any country irrespective,85
NA,of its politics. At the same time as he,85
NA,criticizes us for advocating trade with these,85
NA,"countries, he trades with them himself, sell-",85
NA,ing his wool to red Russia simply because he,85
NA,can get an extra penny per lb. for it.,85
NA,"The Opposition simply says, "" Let us face",85
NA,"the issue "". If we decided to trade only",85
NA,with those countries whose politics are tbe,85
NA,"same as our own, we would not be able to",85
NA,"trade, I presume, with New Zealand be-",85
NA,cause it has a Labour government and we,85
NA,have a Tory government. We would be,85
NA,"able to trade with, the United Kingdom",85
NA,only so long as it elected Tory governments.,85
NA,"If a Labour government were elected, pre-",85
NA,sumably we would stop trading because we,85
NA,disagreed with that Government's politics.,85
NA,This is a magnificent form of reasoning-,85
NA,that once a government's politics are,85
NA,different from ours we should refuse to,85
NA,trade with the people of that country. That,85
NA,is the kind of addled thinking which,85
NA,typifies the attitude on the Goverament side,85
NA,of the chamber to this question of trade with,85
NA,"China. I believe, as I have always said, that",85
NA,we ought to trade with any country. The,85
NA,"more we extend the avenues of trade, the",85
NA,better the chance we will have of selling our,85
NA,"surplus commodities, and the better the",85
NA,chance we will have of getting higher prices,85
NA,for our existing exports such as wool.,85
NA,Let us look at the situation which has,85
NA,been gradually developing in this country,85
NA,since this Government has been responsible,85
NA,for its finances. In 1958-59 our overseas,85
NA,"reserves were Â£16,000,000 more than in the",85
NA,previous year. That sounds quite good.,85
NA,"But against the increase of Â£16,000,000",85
NA,"must be offset Â£203,000,000 worth of",86
NA,"invisibles including freight charges, insur-",86
NA,ance payments and interest on overseas,86
NA,"borrowing. Consequently, instead of having",86
NA,"a surplus of Â£16,000,000 we had a deficit of",86
NA,"Â£187,000,000.",86
NA,It may be said that there is nothing we,86
NA,can do about the invisibles. I disagree en-,86
NA,tirely with that statement. A substantial,86
NA,"part of the Â£203,000,000 consists of ship-",86
NA,ping charges which are arbitrarily fixed by,86
NA,the shipping cartels in the United Kingdom,86
NA,and other parts of the world. These charges,86
NA,are fixed at the maximum rate that the car-,86
NA,tels are able to extract from the primary,86
NA,"producers, especially those in this country",86
NA,who have to iely on shipping to get their,86
NA,goods to the world markets. The Govern-,86
NA,ment should expand the Commonwealth-,86
NA,owned shipping line so that the people's own,86
NA,ships may be used to carry the produce of,86
NA,this country for the actual cost of working,86
NA,the vessel.,86
NA,Mr Forbes -Pu t Lascars on.,86
Mr CLYDE CAMERON , I do not,86
NA,know which honorable member opposite,86
NA,interjected but one of them looks like a,86
NA,Lascar himself. I do not agree with putting,86
NA,Lascars on the ships. The mentality on the,86
NA,Government side of the chamber is indi-,86
NA,cated by this suggestion that Lascars should,86
NA,be employed on Commonwealth-owned,86
NA,ships at cut rates of wages. We could and,86
NA,should employ good Australian seamen on,86
NA,"our own Australian ships, pay them decent",86
NA,wages and save the exorbitant profit that,86
NA,goes to the shipping cartels in England. A,86
NA,tremendous reduction would then be made,86
NA,in the invisible charges that have to be paid,86
NA,by the primary producers. The poor old,86
NA,primary producer is the one who fattens,86
NA,the shareholders of the P. & O. line.,86
NA,And has anybody in this House ever heard,86
NA,one word of protest from members of the,86
NA,-Country Party against that form of,86
NA,exploitation? Of course not!,86
NA,Mr Daly -Ther e is only one of them,86
NA,awake.,86
Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,A s the,86
NA,"honorable member says, there is only one",86
NA,"of them awake at the moment, which in-",86
NA,dicates the interest the members of the,86
NA,Country Party have in the affairs of the,86
NA,people they pretend to represent. The,86
NA,"point I wanted to make was that, in addi-",86
NA,tion to the drain that has occurred already,86
NA,"in our overseas balances, this Government",86
NA,has now decided to increase by another,86
NA,"Â£50,000,000 the value of imports it will",86
NA,"permit to come into the country. Therefore,",86
NA,"we have to find a further Â£50,000,000 worth",86
NA,"of exports to meet the extra Â£50,000,000",86
NA,worth of imports the Government has now,86
NA,decided to allow into the country. It is true,86
NA,that there has been an increase in the price,86
NA,of wool and that this increase will to a,86
NA,"large extent meet the extra Â£50,000,000",86
NA,worth of imports the Government has,86
NA,"decided to admit to the country, but the",86
NA,important point is that the whole of the,86
NA,increase in the price of wool which we,86
NA,expect to flow to us as a consequence of,86
NA,the Russian entry into the wool market,86
NA,is now going to be absorbed by the increased,86
NA,import quotas this Government has decided,86
NA,to allow.,86
NA,"Still talking about invisibles, I emphasize",86
NA,that when we send dividends out of this,86
NA,country as a consequence of foreign invest-,86
NA,ment here we are sending away something,86
NA,for which we will get no return whatever.,86
NA,It is something like the tribute which the,86
NA,Romans extracted many centuries ago.,86
NA,When the conquering Roman armies,86
NA,marched into foreign lands and subjugated,86
NA,"the peoples, governors were appointed to",86
NA,rule them and to collect tribute from them,86
NA,"to be sent to Rome. To-day, overseas",86
NA,capitalists are doing much the same thing.,86
NA,The only difference is that they are invited,86
NA,here. They are being feted and given great,86
NA,"treatment by the Australian Government,",86
NA,not so that they will bring armies to extract,86
NA,tribute from us but in order that they will,86
NA,bring in capital which is just as effective,86
NA,a means of extracting tribute not only this,86
NA,year and next year but for centuries to,86
NA,"come, unless some other government steps",86
NA,in and puts an end to it.,86
NA,Let us now examine the position of,86
NA,General Motors-Holden's Limited. Last,86
NA,"year, the company made a net profit of",86
NA,"Â£15,000,000; that is after paying taxation",86
NA,and after setting aside a very liberal amount,86
NA,"for depreciation, and a large amount for",86
NA,"reserves. The actual profit was Â£30,000,000,",86
NA,"and 425 per cent, of the original net capital",86
NA,of the company was sent abroad last year,86
NA,"in the form of dividends. In other words,",86
NA,General Motors-Holden's Limited sent,86
NA,"away Â£7,500,000, an amount equal to 425",87
NA,"per cent, of the original capital investment.",87
NA,"In fact, if one looks at the total net profit",87
NA,that General Motors-Holden's Limited made,87
NA,"one finds that it represents 800 per cent,",87
NA,profit in one year on the original capital,87
NA,investment.,87
NA,There has been a good deal of miscon-,87
NA,ception about the original capital of,87
NA,General Motors-Holden's Limited. No,87
NA,doubt many people know that the original,87
NA,capital invested in this company was about,87
NA,"Â£2,225,000. But there was not one",87
NA,American dollar in that amount! That,87
NA,"Â£2,225,000 was lent to General Motors-",87
NA,Holden's Limited by the Commonwealth,87
NA,Bank!,87
NA,Mr Anderson -Unde r what govern-,87
NA,ment?,87
Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,Unde r the,87
NA,Chifley Government. So every time the,87
NA,honorable member praises General Motors-,87
NA,"Holden's Limited, as he did in his",87
NA,speech,87
NA,Mr Anderson - I did not praise the,87
NA,company.,87
Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,Th e honor-,87
NA,able member did! I read the report of his,87
NA,"speech, and it did not surprise me that he",87
NA,said that it was a marvellous thing to see,87
NA,General Motors-Holden's Limited making,87
NA,"Â£30,000,000 profit while the primary pro-",87
NA,ducers did not know which way to turn to,87
NA,pay their debts.,87
NA,Mr Anderson - I said that I did not,87
NA,praise the company.,87
Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,On e minute,87
NA,the honorable member praises the idea of,87
NA,General Motors-Holden's Limited making,87
NA,"a profit of Â£30,000,000, and now he speaks",87
NA,as though it is a terrible thing because the,87
NA,Labour Government introduced the pro-,87
NA,posal in 1947 for the establishment of the,87
NA,company.,87
NA,Mr Anderson -Wha t nonsense!,87
The CHAIRMAN , Mr Bowden) -,87
NA,Order! The honorable member for Hume,87
NA,"will remain silent, as will all other honor-",87
NA,able members.,87
Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,Som e might fits,87
NA,"ask, ""Why does not General Motorsour",87
NA,Holden's Limited increase the capital base,87
NA,of its undertaking here? Why does it still,87
NA,"leave the base at Â£2,225,000? Why does",87
NA,it not issue bonus shares as other com-,87
NA,"panies do? "" There is a very good reason.",87
NA,If the company did increase the capital,87
NA,"base of its assets, then, for a start, it would",87
NA,have to pay a capitalization tax of 15 per,87
NA,"cent., and it is not prepared to do so.",87
NA,"Indeed, General Motors-Holden's Limited",87
NA,is determined to pay as little by way of,87
NA,"tax as it can to the Australian people, and,",87
NA,while it is determined to pay as little by,87
NA,"way of tax as it can, having got the Go-",87
NA,vernment- I think it was in 1953-t o agree,87
NA,"to the abolition of double taxation, so that",87
NA,it now pays no tax at all on certain earn-,87
NA,"ings on which it previously paid tax, it is",87
NA,charging the Australian users of its pro-,87
NA,duct as much as it can extract from them,87
NA,while paying its employees only what the,87
NA,Vehicle Builders Union forces it to pay.,87
NA,"If it were not for the efforts of this union,",87
NA,which is constantly pressing the company,87
NA,for increased wages and decent conditions,87
NA,"of employment, General Motors-Holden's",87
NA,Limited would be in a very much better,87
NA,"position than it is to-day, and the employees",87
NA,would be in a very much worse position.,87
NA,Profit can be made in one of two ways-,87
NA,either by under-paying the employees or,87
NA,by overcharging consumers for the goods,87
NA,produced. I believe that General Motors-,87
NA,Holden's Limited is doing a little bit of,87
NA,each. It is certainly true that it is over-,87
NA,charging when one looks at the profits it,87
NA,"makes on the goods it sells and, having",87
NA,"regard to the profits, I believe the com-",87
NA,pany is grossly underpaying the men it,87
NA,employs.,87
NA,I have referred to the tribute that is,87
NA,being extracted from this country. Let me,87
NA,"explain what I mean. In 1948-49, 4 i per",87
NA,"cent, of the total national income of Aus-",87
NA,tralia went abroad in the form of dividends,87
NA,on capital invested in this country from,87
NA,overseas. Let me now give the figure for,87
NA,"1956-57, which is only two years ago.",87
NA,The amount has been increased sub-,87
NA,"stantially since then, as every one will",87
NA,"agree, but the year 1956-57 is the last",87
NA,year for which I have been able to obtain,87
NA,figures. The tribute taken out of this,87
NA,country by foreign investors in the form,87
NA,of dividends from which we get no bene-,87
NA,"whatever amounted to 8 i per cent, of",87
NA,national income in 1956-57. How,87
NA,much longer will this drift be allowed to,87
NA,continue? If the percentage gets higher,87
NA,"and higher, the time will come when 50",87
NA,"per cent, of our total national income will",88
NA,"be sent to overseas investors, while the",88
NA,"people who produce it, and the country",88
NA,"which is responsible for its production, will",88
NA,get no benefit whatever from it.,88
NA,I believe that we are now faced with a,88
NA,very serious situation. This Government,88
NA,is allowing an inflationary situation to,88
NA,develop. Even its own supporters are now,88
NA,beginning to criticize it and ask very perti-,88
NA,nent questions about it. I refer the House,88
NA,to the speech delivered by the honorable,88
NA,"member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner), who",88
NA,is a member of the Liberal Party in this,88
NA,Parliament. This is what he said only the,88
NA,day before yesterday-,88
NA,Fear and anxiety are gripping at the hearts of,88
NA,tens of thousands of thrifty people in this com-,88
NA,munity as they watch the erosion of their savings,88
NA,and wonder how they can provide for their declining,88
NA,"years. I make a plea for these forgotten people,",88
NA,who are a numerous and not negligible section,88
NA,of the community.,88
NA,The Leader of the Opposition (Dr,88
NA,Evatt) was perfectly correct when he,88
NA,described this as a rich man's budget. I t,88
NA,"is a rich man's budget, as Country Party",88
NA,member after Country Party member and,88
NA,some Liberal Party members i n Country,88
NA,Party seats have indicated. It is a budget,88
NA,which seeks to give enormous reductions in,88
NA,income tax to the very wealthy and the,88
NA,paltry sum of 9d. a week to the ordinary,88
NA,family man with two or three children.,88
NA,"To illustrate this point, I mention the case",88
NA,"of the man who is earning Â£1,000 a year",88
NA,and who has three children. He is now,88
NA,paying Â£54 a year in income tax. He is to,88
NA,receive a magnificent reduction of ls. in,88
NA,"the Â£1 or 54s., not a week, not a day as",88
NA,some of the rich will receive under,88
NA,"this Budget, but a year. He is to get",88
NA,the wonderful payout of ls. a week!,88
NA,"That is completely illusory, because he has",88
NA,not yet looked at the effect of the basic,88
NA,wage increase. When he adds the 15s. in-,88
NA,crease in the basic wage-equivalen t to,88
NA,"Â£39 a year-t o his income of Â£1,000, he",88
NA,will find that instead of enjoying a reduc-,88
NA,"tion of Â£2 14s. a year, as the Treasurer",88
NA,"pretended, he will pay an extra Â£6 a year.",88
NA,"Instead of paying Â£54, as he did last year,",88
NA,he will pay Â£60 a year because of the effect,88
NA,of the basic wage increase upon his salary.,88
NA,"It must not be forgotten, either, that the",88
NA,increase in the basic wage does not improve,88
NA,"his standard of living. It merely seeks,",88
NA,"belatedly, to maintain his present standard.",88
NA,"Therefore, he is forced to pay Â£6 a year",88
NA,"more in tax than he paid last year, instead",88
NA,"of paying less, as the Government claims.",88
NA,"Turning to the other side of the picture,",88
NA,the wealthy men who live in the mansions,88
NA,"of Vaucluse, Springfield, Toorak and all",88
NA,the other flash suburbs in the various,88
NA,capital cities-th e stock exchange investors,88
NA,"and bankers, men whose incomes are about",88
NA,"Â£20,000 or Â£30,000 a year-ar e not",88
NA,affected by the 15s. increase in the basic,88
NA,wage. Let honorable members not laugh,88
NA,"when I mention incomes of Â£20,000 and",88
NA,"Â£30,000, because there are in Australia",88
NA,men who receive such incomes. The re-,88
NA,duction in their income tax will be of the,88
NA,"order of Â£10 a week, while the man on",88
NA,"Â£1,000 a year, with three children to main-",88
NA,"tain, will have to pay an extra Â£6 a year.",88
NA,This Government talks about a deficit,88
NA,"of some Â£61,000,000. What is a deficit?",88
NA,When a government has commitments,88
NA,which it cannot meet from taxation and,88
NA,"from borrowings, it has to make up the",88
NA,difference in some manner. This Govern-,88
NA,ment proposes to bridge the gap with trea-,88
NA,sury-bills. What will happen will be that,88
NA,the private banks will buy from the Go-,88
NA,"vernment, with credit created by the pri-",88
NA,"vate banks, these treasury-bills issued by",88
NA,the Government to bridge the gap between,88
NA,commitments on the one hand and revenue,88
NA,and loan raisings on the other hand. No,88
NA,"real money, no new money in the true",88
NA,"sense of the word, will be made available.",88
NA,Credit created by the private banks is to,88
NA,be used by them to pay for the treasury-,88
NA,"bills, on which the Government will then",88
NA,pay interest to the private banks so that,88
NA,they may be reimbursed for the trouble,88
NA,of issuing this imaginary credit. A l l that,88
NA,the private banks will do in this trans-,88
NA,action will be to expand their own credit,88
NA,in order to buy government securities. They,88
NA,"will then use those very securities, which",88
NA,they have bought as a consequence of ex-,88
NA,"panding their own credit, in order to build",88
NA,"up their liquid assets, on which they can",88
NA,make additional credit available to their,88
NA,ordinary borrowers.,88
NA,Who are their ordinary borrowers? As,88
NA,the honorable member for Maranoa has,88
NA,"said, the ordinary borrowers from private",88
NA,"banks to-day are not the farmers, who are",89
NA,living in hope that they might get money,89
NA,from the new Development Bank. The,89
NA,ordinary borrowers from private banks to-,89
NA,day are the hire-purchase companies. What,89
NA,is their position? The honorable member,89
NA,for Hume ( Mr Anderson) is shaking his,89
NA,"head. Of course, he would not know any-",89
NA,thing about hire-purchase transactions.,89
NA,Having sold his wool to the Russians at,89
NA,"such a high price, he does not know any-",89
NA,thing about buying goods on hire purchase.,89
NA,I can tell the honorable gentleman that the,89
NA,Australian community has increased its,89
NA,indebtedness to hire-purchase companies,89
NA,"from about Â£58,000,000 ten years, ago to",89
NA,"Â£351,000,000, which is the amount now",89
NA,owing to the various hire-purchase com-,89
NA,panies. These companies in turn are get-,89
NA,ting their money from people who normally,89
NA,would be making money available in go-,89
NA,vernment loans for government undertak-,89
NA,ings and public works.,89
NA,"If bank credit is to be extended, why can",89
NA,the Commonwealth Bank not extend the,89
NA,credit which is now allowed to be handled,89
NA,by the private banks? If the Common-,89
NA,"wealth Bank did so, the interest would be",89
NA,"payable to the Government itself, and no",89
NA,"interest would be payable, as it is now",89
NA,"payable, to the private banks. There would",89
NA,"therefore be no secondary innation, such as",89
NA,is the case when money is borrowed from,89
NA,"the private banks, or when private banks",89
NA,are allowed to buy treasury-bills on artifi-,89
NA,cially or privately created bank credit. The,89
NA,interest rate in this country has reached an,89
NA,alarming level. The total interest bill is,89
NA,"Â£148,000,000 a year, as",89
NA,"Â£83,000,000 a year ten years ago. We",89
NA,cannot go on forever building up this,89
NA,enormous indebtedness in interest rates to,89
NA,overseas lenders of money and to internal,89
NA,lenders of money to the Australian Go-,89
NA,vernment. We cannot go on forever meet-,89
NA,ing this enormous interest bill of,89
NA,"Â£148,000,000 a year. There has to be an",89
NA,"end to it sooner or later, and the sooner",89
NA,the better.,89
NA,I want to deal quickly with the Budget,89
NA,as it affects various groups. I remind,89
NA,the Committee that the Government has,89
NA,decided to reduce income tax by,89
NA,"Â£20,000,000, the major portion of which",89
NA,will go into the pockets of the very rich,89
NA,"people, company investors and banking",89
NA,institutions of the country. Government,89
NA,supporters say that high taxes are an im-,89
NA,"pediment to earning capacity, but I do not",89
NA,believe it. I do not believe that you can,89
NA,stop people from wanting to earn more,89
NA,money simply by increasing their taxes.,89
NA,That is a myth that ought to be exploded.,89
NA,This Government is wrong in paying out,89
NA,every year more and more handouts to,89
NA,"the rich who do not need them, leaving the",89
NA,poor who need relief so badly to flounder,89
NA,along as best they can. The Government,89
NA,has given a handout to the wealthy by,89
NA,deciding that those who can afford to pay,89
NA,Â£8 a week in insurance premiums will be,89
NA,able to deduct the whole Â£8 from their,89
NA,taxable income. What working man can,89
NA,afford to pay Â£8 a week in insurance pre-,89
NA,"miums? Obviously, this is another hand-",89
NA,out to the very wealthy. Private com-,89
NA,panies will receive taxation concessions,89
NA,"amounting to Â£2,250,000. Foreign oil",89
NA,"companies, which have taken up all the",89
NA,oil prospecting leases with the exception,89
NA,"of two or three, will get a handout of",89
NA,"Â£1,250,000. When they find oil, they will",89
NA,"decide whether we get the oil and, if so,",89
NA,at what price.,89
NA,That is the sort of thing done by this,89
NA,"Government, which claims to represent",89
NA,the people. It has announced a reduction,89
NA,"of i d . a gallon in excise duty on petrol,",89
NA,but it has no guarantee from the oil,89
NA,companies that the i d . reduction in excise,89
NA,will be passed on to the motorist. I shall,89
NA,be very surprised indeed if it is in fact,89
NA,passed on. The Government has announced,89
NA,its intention to increase the age pension by,89
NA,"against 7s. 6d. a week, that is, to 34.5 per cent,",89
NA,"of to-day's basic wage, whereas the pension",89
NA,fixed by the Chifley Government was 37,89
NA,"per cent, of the basic wage in 1948. If the",89
NA,Government maintained the relationship,89
NA,between the pension and the basic wage,89
NA,established by the Chifley Government,89
NA,eleven years ago-everybod y else has had,89
NA,an increase except the ordinary worker-,89
NA,the pension would be not Â£4 15s. but,89
NA,Â£5 3s. Yet this Government has the,89
NA,cheek to boast about what it is doing for,89
NA,pensioners.,89
NA,An amazing position exists in relation to,89
NA,proposed increases in postal charges,89
NA,"amounting to about Â£17,800,000 a year.",89
NA,"The ordinary letter rate, which is applic-",89
NA,"able to letters written by the average man,",89
NA,"wili be increased from 4d. to 5d., while",90
NA,"the air mail rate, which is applicable mostly",90
NA,to letters written by business men and,90
NA,wealthy people who want quick replies,90
NA,"and do not worry about a 3d. surcharge,",90
NA,will be reduced from 7d. to 5d. The main,90
NA,beneficiary from the increased charges will,90
NA,"be Ansett-A.N.A., because it is proposed",90
NA,that all letters will be sent by air. I hope,90
NA,"that Ansetts, when carrying out this con-",90
NA,"tract, will do it a litde more honestly than",90
NA,was the case six months ago when one of,90
NA,their big motor transports overturned on the,90
NA,"Hume Highway and its contents, scattered",90
NA,"alf along the road for everybody to sec,",90
NA,included thousands and thousands of air,90
NA,"mail letters. These letters, on which the",90
NA,"Government had been paid 7d., were being",90
NA,moved by ordinary surface transport.,90
NA,Mr Killen -Ca n you prove that?,90
Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,Tha t can be,90
NA,proved.,90
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The honor-,90
NA,able gentieman's time has expired.,90
Mr OPPERMAN ,Corio) [10.19]-I f is,90
NA,always interesting to hear the honorable,90
NA,member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde,90
NA,"Cameron), who has just concluded his",90
NA,"speech. As usual, it makes up in fluency",90
NA,and force what it lacks in sense and logic.,90
NA,The honorable member referred to wool.,90
NA,"I remember that when we put a 30 per cent,",90
NA,tax on wool sales to balance against future,90
NA,"income tax as a buttress against inflation,",90
NA,the honorable member as well as the Leader,90
NA,of the Opposition (Dr Evatt) and the,90
NA,Deputy Leader ( Mr Calwell) put up a,90
NA,bold fight purely for the sake of being,90
NA,opportunist protagonists for the poor,90
NA,old woolgrowers. It is rather ironical to,90
NA,hear the honorable member speak of the,90
NA,lack of cohesion in the Liberal Party when,90
NA,one thinks of a case now before the court,90
NA,"concerning a certain trade union, and when",90
NA,one also thinks of the dissension in the,90
NA,Australian Labour Party to-day which has,90
NA,caused it to lose the confidence of the,90
NA,Australian people. The honorable mem-,90
NA,ber's economics are sadly off the beam,90
NA,when he talks of nationalized shipping lines,90
NA,because he overlooks conveniently the cost,90
NA,of running a ship on Australian charter,90
NA,"rates of pay. Obviously, those rates would",90
NA,"have to be paid, buf they are more than",90
NA,"Â£200 above the British charter rates. So,",90
NA,the primary producer whom the honorable,90
NA,member professes to be so solicitous about,90
NA,would be merely subsidizing the honorable,90
NA,member's socialistic ideas.,90
NA,"Before I speak on the Budget, I would",90
NA,like to congratulate the Treasurer ( Mr.,90
NA,Harold Holt) on bringing forward his first,90
NA,Budget. We in this Parliament know the,90
NA,"right honorable gentleman's versatility, his",90
NA,"experience and capacity, which have made",90
NA,him a most prominent political figure. Fol-,90
NA,lowing his representation of Australia over-,90
NA,seas in various roles which he filled so,90
NA,"capably as Minister for Immigration, Minis-",90
NA,ter for Labour and National Service and,90
NA,Chairman of the Commonwealth Parlia-,90
NA,"mentary Association, he is regarded highly",90
NA,abroad as an outstanding statesman. With,90
NA,such a reputation to sustain and having,90
NA,taken over his portfolio from such a re-,90
NA,"nowned personality as Sir Arthur Fadden,",90
NA,the Treasurer might have been forgiven if,90
NA,he had yielded to the human temptation at,90
NA,his first attempt to make a spectacular,90
NA,effort to extend concessions to all sections,90
NA,of the community. That would have gained,90
NA,him an immediate and temporary popu-,90
NA,"larity, but it would have been gambling with",90
NA,"Australia's future. However, to his credit",90
NA,"and to the benefit of Australia, he has",90
NA,demonstrated the level-headed judgment,90
NA,which has earned him his present important,90
NA,portfolio. Instead of yielding to any such,90
NA,impulse the right honorable gentleman has,90
NA,"reflected in this Budget the restraint, con-",90
NA,trol and sense of responsibility which has,90
NA,marked the Administration of the Menzies,90
NA,Government during the past ten years.,90
NA,The Opposition in fairness to its own fol-,90
NA,"lowers who, after all, derive the greatest",90
NA,benefit from stability in employment should,90
NA,indicate some appreciation of the situation,90
NA,instead of endeavouring once more to,90
NA,create the same old atmosphere of gloom,90
NA,"and depression. For years, the Opposi-",90
NA,tion has despairingly tried to paint a gloomy,90
NA,picture of what lies ahead. Honorable,90
NA,members opposite know that the position is,90
NA,quite different; and their recognition of the,90
NA,"facts slips out occasionally. For instance,",90
NA,the honorable member for Grayndler ( Mr.,90
NA,Daly) said last night-,90
NA,"The Budget appals me, particularly in view of",90
NA,this period of prosperity and progress.,90
NA,That statement came from an honorable,91
NA,member opposite. The lack of consistency,91
NA,and intensity in the Opposition's attack,91
NA,reveals just how unsure it is of its ground.,91
NA,"During my ten years in this Parliament, I",91
NA,have never heard such a variety of con-,91
NA,flicting opinions as those expressed by,91
NA,members of the Opposition in support of,91
NA,the amendment moved by their leader.,91
NA,"This, perhaps, is not to be wondered at, for",91
NA,this is the tenth round of their endeavours,91
NA,to dislodge the Menzies Government. As,91
NA,they have delivered every type of budget,91
NA,body blow known to political science and,91
NA,have been punched back on the ropes each,91
NA,"time, while they face another desperate",91
NA,"defensive for the ensuing twelve months,",91
NA,there is some excuse for their coming into,91
NA,"this encounter and wondering, exhausted",91
NA,"and battered as they are, just how they can",91
NA,make some sort of a showing which will,91
NA,justify them continuing as one of the,91
NA,contestants.,91
NA,"After all, a party which has been preof",91
NA,dicting for ten years terrific financial,91
NA,"disasters, great unemployment, the collapse",91
NA,"of overseas markets, the winning of the",91
NA,elections and the ill wind of the public,91
NA,"the Government, while still having a few",91
NA,"internal fights on its own hands, must",91
NA,come to the stage that this Opposition,91
NA,undoubtedly has reached. It has the feeling,91
NA,that the public places no reliance on its,91
NA,arguments and has no faith in its alternabeen,91
NA,tive methods and plans for developing along,91
NA,sound lines. How wrong the Labour Party,91
NA,has been year after year. It,91
NA,to reflect on the last Budget as a measuring,91
NA,stick of the reliability of the Opposition in,91
NA,criticizing this Budget. During the Budget,91
NA,"debate last year, the Deputy Leader of the",91
NA,"Opposition ( Mr Calwell), whom we can",91
NA,accept as expressing the typical outlook,91
NA,"the Labour Party, said-",91
NA,The mess in which this Government finds itself,91
NA,"in regard to loan raising, in regard to loan",91
NA,"versions, in regard to cash balances, in regard",91
NA,"deficits, in regard to inflation and in regard to",91
NA,everything else is of its own making. Nobody,91
NA,else created its problems. They cannot be,91
NA,on to labour troubles because the Government,91
NA,continually boasts of the amount of peace there,91
NA,has been in industry since it has been in office.,91
NA,Those sentences offer the best complipened,91
NA,ment that could be paid to the Liberal,91
NA,"management of the country, for if we",91
NA,unequivocally blamed in 1958,91
NA,"alleged mess, and, by contrast, in 1959",91
NA,"the economic position is even sounder, the",91
NA,Government must be given the credit.,91
NA,What is the position? Loan raising has,91
NA,"been at a record level of Â£206,500,000.",91
NA,Loan conversions have been readily met.,91
NA,The Budget deficit has been decreased from,91
NA,"Â£110,000,000 to Â£29,500,000. There is a",91
NA,"record amount in savings banks, and the",91
NA,average deposit stands at Â£136 a head of,91
NA,"population, compared with Â£129 a head in",91
NA,1958. That does not indicate an infla-,91
NA,tionary spiral.,91
NA,The honorable member for Hindmarsh,91
NA,referred to hire purchase. The fact that,91
NA,we can have hire-purchase borrowings at,91
NA,the current level and still have an increase,91
NA,in savings bank deposits indicates that the,91
NA,condition of the nation is good. The,91
NA,people have more washing machines and,91
NA,refrigerators. Construction of houses has,91
NA,"increased, and the people have all the other",91
NA,things which constitute a higher standard,91
NA,living. The Opposition can talk about,91
NA,"statistics and percentages, but every married",91
NA,couple going into a house to-day has it well,91
NA,"next furnished, with carpets on the floor. A",91
NA,"for few years later they have a motor car,",91
NA,because the Australian motor car industry,91
NA,enables them to start life on a better basis,91
NA,than was possible at any previous stage,91
NA,in our history. All this is indicative of,91
NA,higher standards. The - Labour Party has,91
NA,completely wrong in its forecasts. It,91
NA,has looked into the crystal ball and tried,91
NA,"to prophesy the future, but with singular",91
NA,is well perhaps lack of success.,91
NA,Mr Daly -Wha t about sales of bicycles?,91
Mr OPPERMAN , The honorable,91
NA,member for Grayndler asks about bicycle,91
NA,of sales. My reply is that that is one of the,91
NA,measuring sticks of the higher standard of,91
NA,living. Sales of bicycles have fallen off,91
NA,"as sales of motor cars, motor scooters and",91
NA,conother forms of transport have risen. During,91
NA,"to this Government's ten years of office, we",91
NA,have had violent fluctuations of income.,91
NA,blamed Had the position not been handled with,91
NA,"courage and foresight by the Government,",91
NA,what the Opposition predicted could have,91
NA,"happened. Assuredly, it would have hap-",91
NA,if the Labour Party had been in,91
NA,office and put into operation its ideas on,91
NA,were economics and finance. The economy,91
NA,for an would have been wrecked.,91
NA,Every time action was taken by the Go-,92
NA,vernment to balance these fluctuations and,92
NA,"changes in the national income, the Oppo-",92
NA,sition predicted immediate disaster. Yet,92
NA,"this era, as a result of the Government's",92
NA,"financial restraint and control of imports,",92
NA,has proved to be the most prosperous in,92
NA,"the history of this country. If, in the",92
NA,words of the Deputy Leader of the Oppo-,92
NA,"sition, our troubles were of our own",92
NA,"making, then surely our present prosperity",92
NA,must be regarded as of our own creation.,92
NA,"Topically enough, the quotation that",92
NA,appeared on yesterday's date pad was-,92
NA,Chance never helps those who do not help,92
NA,themselves.,92
NA,This Government has helped this country,92
NA,to its present state. During the period I,92
NA,"have mentioned, our population has in-",92
NA,"creased from under 8,000,000 to over",92
NA,"10,000,000 people. That has called for a",92
NA,tremendous effort in handling and guidance.,92
NA,We have also in that period of time attracted,92
NA,"more than Â£700,000,000 of foreign capital",92
NA,from overseas sources. Everybody knows,92
NA,that money outside a country-mone y which,92
NA,is available for investment-ha s a sensitivity,92
NA,to the state of the country into which it may,92
NA,come. The existing conditions in that,92
NA,country are carefully watched and checked,92
NA,so as to provide a guide to the conditions,92
NA,which might apply in the future. The fact,92
NA,"that more than Â£700,000,000 worth of",92
NA,overseas capital has come to this country,92
NA,is quite an objective compliment to the,92
NA,state of affairs in Australia that has,92
NA,during these years.,92
NA,We have retained the goodwill of the,92
NA,International Bank for Reconstruction and,92
NA,"Development, and we have raised dollar",92
NA,"loans amounting to Â£317,000,000 which",92
NA,are not given lightly.,92
NA,Our secondary industries-thi s is impor-,92
NA,tant to the Labour Party on the other side,92
NA,of the chamber-hav e been developed.,92
NA,Surely if their policy and outlook and plat-,92
NA,form made an appeal to the ordinary work-,92
NA,"ing man, honorable members opposite",92
NA,would be in offics here to-day. I find that,92
NA,there are at present in existence in this,92
NA,"country 53,200 factories producing goods",92
NA,"worth Â£4,710,000,000 this year, and we have",92
NA,come to be the world's eighth trading nation.,92
NA,"This, I say quite confidently, has been a",92
NA,"magnificent decade-on e in which, although",92
NA,"almost Â£80,000,000 has been expended on",92
NA,"repatriation benefits, Â£236,600,000 on social",92
NA,"services, Â£24,100,000 on pharmaceutical",92
NA,"benefits, Â£12,000,000 on migration, and",92
NA,"Â£192,800,000 on defence, the Government",92
NA,has also met the demands of water conser-,92
NA,vation by projects such as the Snowy,92
NA,Mountains scheme. Through State instru-,92
NA,"mentalities, 50,000 miles of macadamized",92
NA,"roads have been constructed, and hospitals",92
NA,"and schools have been built. All this, mark",92
NA,"you, in spite of the tremendous handicaps",92
NA,consequent on our country being approxi-,92
NA,mately the size of the United States and our,92
NA,population being about the same as that of,92
NA,Greater London! No other country in the,92
NA,world with such a small population in rela-,92
NA,tion to its area enjoys such a high standard,92
NA,of living as we enjoy. But we must con-,92
NA,tinue to face frontiers in the areas that have,92
NA,not been fully developed. In an expanding,92
NA,"community, this must always be the case.",92
NA,The last decade has been a period of,92
NA,"tremendous financial, industrial and com-",92
NA,mercial activity. There are people who,92
NA,want the benefit of all these things but they,92
NA,"do not want to bear, the expense associated",92
NA,with obtaining them. They want the things,92
NA,that cannot be obtained without an infusion,92
NA,of money. Members of the Opposition,92
NA,must realize that a higher standard of living,92
NA,cannot be obtained without work. They,92
NA,have criticized the take-overs and mergers,92
NA,that have occurred during the period that,92
NA,the population of this country has risen,92
NA,"from fewer than 8,000,000 people to more",92
NA,"existed than 10,000,000 people. The speeches",92
NA,that have been delivered by honorable,92
NA,members opposite make it evident that they,92
NA,think that success is something to be,92
NA,deplored. I cannot believe that they really,92
NA,think along those lines. Such developments,92
NA,are merely a reflection of expansion of,92
NA,enterprise and individuality; they do not,92
NA,represent monopolies. Let us look at the,92
NA,history of take-overs. The increased effi-,92
NA,ciency that accompanies them enables prices,92
NA,to be reduced. Has there been any less,92
NA,competition because the Myer Emporium,92
NA,"Limited, Cox Brothers (Australia) Limited,",92
NA,"Waltons-Sears Limited, Patersons Proprie-",92
NA,"tary Limited, Reid Murrays Limited, Elec-",92
NA,"tronic Industries Limited, and Pye Holdings",92
NA,have become involved in such business,92
NA,"deals? Of course not! In fact, added",92
NA,capital and larger premises have demanded,92
NA,"a higher turnover, with consequent better",92
NA,prices and better services to the public,93
NA,brighter prospects for the employees.,93
NA,The last ten years have been an era such,93
NA,as we have never before known in Aus-,93
NA,tralia. This is the era for big men. It,93
NA,"provides a test for executives, and offers",93
NA,"opportunities for men who are efficient,",93
NA,untiring and diligent. This decade has,93
NA,shown the calibre of Australians and has,93
NA,"revealed their status. The Ansetts, Richard-",93
NA,"sons, Myers, Warners, Kormans and",93
NA,Beaurepaires deserve our admiration. We,93
NA,"might criticize them for various reasons,",93
NA,but they have contributed enormously to,93
NA,"our prosperity by their business acumen,",93
NA,courage and enterprise. They are men who,93
NA,"commenced on a shoestring, as Opposition",93
NA,"members could have done, and were once",93
NA,workers on the line. They command our,93
NA,admiration. We know of their early,93
NA,beginnings. They have shown by their,93
NA,results what a land of opportunity this is.,93
NA,"Honorable members opposite, when",93
NA,talking about the big profits that have,93
NA,"made by companies and individuals, should",93
NA,"study the income tax figures. First, com-",93
NA,"panies are required to pay tax, and",93
NA,"secondly, dividends are taxable in the",93
NA,hands of the shareholders. Our taxation,93
NA,system takes care very effectively of high,93
NA,"profits and still leaves room for incentive,",93
NA,the honorable member for Melbourne has,93
NA,indicated that he acknowledges this. Did,93
NA,"he not recently open an Â£8,000 community",93
NA,centre at Clayton that was donated by a,93
NA,"Mr Bill Viney who, eight years ago, was",93
NA,"an unemployed builder's labourer, but has",93
NA,"since built 1,000 houses and has orders",93
NA,for another 500 houses? This success story,93
NA,is symbolic of Labour's inability to grasp,93
NA,the fact that hundreds of thousands of,93
NA,Australian workers who listened avidly ten,93
NA,years ago to stories of capitalism grinding,93
NA,"down workers, are to-day employers, exe-",93
NA,"cutives and capitalists, and are providing",93
NA,examples which other workers wish to fol-,93
NA,low. The whole application and oudook,93
NA,"of Australia is shaped in that way, and so",93
NA,long as the old guard of Labour keeps,93
NA,trotting out this socialist bogey and per-,93
NA,sists in its criticism of profits honorable,93
NA,members opposite will remain where they,93
NA,are for years to come.,93
NA,The honorable member for Grayndler,93
NA,( Mr Daly) dealt very comprehensively,93
NA,and General Motors-Holden's Limited-t o a,93
NA,degree that his colleagues had not done-i n,93
NA,an endeavour to offset the fact that that,93
NA,company was commenced during the regime,93
NA,of a Labour government.,93
NA,Mr Ward -Tha t is right.,93
Mr OPPERMAN ,Labou r made the,93
NA,conditions.,93
NA,"Mr Ward -No , we did not make them.",93
NA,You are mistaken.,93
Mr OPPERMAN ,Th e honorable mem-,93
NA,ber also mentioned the Ford Motor Com-,93
NA,pany of Australia Proprietary Limited. If,93
NA,ever there was an example of what a great,93
NA,"company can do for a city, it is the example",93
NA,of the Ford Motor Company at Geelong.,93
NA,General Motors have established their,93
NA,"premises in Melbourne, and the full effect",93
NA,of that establishment is not readily apparent,93
NA,because its employees live in the many,93
NA,suburbs. But in Geelong the Ford orga-,93
NA,nization has a direct and beneficial effect,93
NA,been upon the economy. At one stage it was,93
NA,thought in Corio that the whole show might,93
NA,be going to Broadmeadows. Let me tell,93
NA,honorable members that there was im-,93
NA,"mediately a set back to local housing, com-",93
NA,merce and confidence. You cannot im-,93
NA,press the Geelong people with talk about,93
NA,profits going overseas. That is only inci-,93
NA,"dental to the amount of work, the amount",93
NA,"of spending, the amount of wages and",93
NA,their effect on the local community and the,93
NA,prosperity in and around it. If more over-,93
NA,seas firms like General Motors would estab-,93
NA,lish themselves or open branches in this,93
NA,"country, it would have a great and bene-",93
NA,"ficial effect on Australia, completely out of",93
NA,proportion to any penalties that we might,93
NA,pay by having to send profits overseas.,93
NA,"Getting away from that matter, Mr.",93
NA,"Chairman, I should like to say a few words",93
NA,about postal charges. These proposals are,93
NA,among the features of the Budget that have,93
NA,"caused some discussion, principally because",93
NA,they have not been properly understood.,93
NA,I am quite sure that as time goes on they,93
NA,will be understood. The subject of postal,93
NA,charges touches a reminiscent chord so,93
NA,"far as I am concerned, because any one",93
NA,who has been associated with that tremen-,93
NA,"dous undertaking, the Postal Department,",93
NA,realizes that there is something about it,93
NA,with that he can never forget.,93
NA,To-night I heard one honorable niember,94
NA,speak of the profits made by the Post Office,94
NA,prior to 1945. Let me point out that those,94
NA,"profits were made, to a great extent, be-",94
NA,cause the average wage paid in the postal,94
NA,service was not as great as the average,94
NA,wage paid outside. In return for some,94
NA,"security, for three weeks annual leave and",94
NA,for long service leave after twenty years,94
NA,"of service, postal employees were prepared",94
NA,to take a lower rate of pay than people,94
NA,working outside. A telegraph messenger,94
NA,pedalled his bicycle around for 15s. a week.,94
NA,"He worked for 48 hours a week, with no",94
NA,"pay for ordinary overtime, and he worked",94
NA,on Saturday afternoons for a rate of pay,94
NA,which would not have been acceptable by,94
NA,people outside. Do you honorable mem-,94
NA,bers on the Labour side want a return to,94
NA,these conditions? We could have cheaper,94
NA,rates on that basis. But they are asking,94
NA,for all possible amenities and all modern,94
NA,"conditions for postal workers, whilst at",94
NA,the same time they .ask for cheaper rates.,94
NA,"I can remember Percy Cerutty, the great",94
NA,"trainer of Australian athletes to-day, pedalIt",94
NA,"ling his bicycle as a linesman, with a big",94
NA,bag of tools on the back of the machine.,94
NA,The overhead on the motorized side of,94
NA,the Postal Department's activities has risen,94
NA,"from about Â£65,000 a year in those days",94
NA,"to Â£4,600,000 a year to-day. A brick",94
NA,building for a post office cost Â£208 a,94
NA,"square in those days, but the present cost",94
NA,is Â£548 a square for a prefabricated build-,94
NA,ing. So it goes on. These factors have,94
NA,to be considered when we are talking about,94
NA,charges for postal services to-day.,94
NA,I know that it was with great regret,94
NA,the Government found it necessary to,94
NA,"increase postal charges, but when one is",94
NA,confronted with the facts that I have out-,94
NA,lined one realizes that something must be,94
NA,done. Heavy losses are currently being,94
NA,incurred on most types of non-letter class,94
NA,"mail, including publications, patterns,",94
NA,"samples and merchandise, printed matter,",94
NA,registered articles and parcels. Even with,94
NA,"the proposed increases, there will still be",94
NA,big losses on the carriage of that class of,94
NA,"mail. Confronted with these facts, one can",94
NA,comprehend that in this day and age the,94
NA,Treasurer and the Cabinet reluctantly had,94
NA,to decide to increase charges. I say again,94
NA,that they did so reluctantly. I know that,94
NA,it was with the greatest reluctance that they,94
NA,came to the decision to alter the rates.,94
NA,"Now, Mr Chairman, I should like to",94
NA,say a few words about immigration. The,94
NA,proposal to increase the rate of intake of,94
NA,"immigrants to 125,000 a year is something",94
NA,"which, on my experience of immigrants in",94
NA,"my electorate, appeals to me greatly. I",94
NA,know that there is some opposition to new,94
NA,people coming into this country. Very,94
NA,often they do not become assimilated,94
NA,rapidly. They tend to remain in their own,94
NA,"groups, and sometimes they are difficult for",94
NA,us to understand. I have always main-,94
NA,tained that the younger generation is the,94
NA,one which will provide more for this,94
NA,country. The older people come here with,94
NA,"their trades and their skills, but the new",94
NA,generation of immigrants will be real Aus-,94
NA,"tralians. In the Corio electorate, where",94
NA,"we have some 10,000 new Australians, we",94
NA,"find that the dux of the form, the head",94
NA,"prefect, the scholarship winner or the",94
NA,winner of an award for distinguished work,94
NA,and outstanding sporting achievements is,94
NA,very often the child of new Australians.,94
NA,is recognized that after a few months in,94
NA,school most of these children become so,94
NA,thoroughly Australian that only their,94
NA,names distinguish them from the native,94
NA,born children.,94
NA,"Having said that, Mr Chairman, I should",94
NA,like to make a suggestion to the Minister,94
NA,for Immigration. I suggest that the,94
NA,Department of Immigration follow the,94
NA,"example of the Repatriation Department,",94
NA,whose officers visit Geelong to give,94
NA,specialized advice to people who have,94
NA,dealings with the department or cases being,94
NA,that dealt with by the department. It was felt,94
NA,originally that this practice would not be,94
NA,"found to be justified, but experience",94
NA,showed that it was a valuable aspect of,94
NA,the department's work. Sometimes when,94
NA,I am away from the electorate I am,94
NA,worried because urgent immigration,94
NA,matters have to wait to be cleared with,94
NA,the central offices of the department. I,94
NA,have a letter here concerning the work of,94
NA,the officers from the Repatriation Depart-,94
NA,ment. It is said that they work in Geelong,94
NA,long after the time each day when they,94
NA,"would normally expect to finish, which",94
NA,must make them very late in returning to,94
NA,Melbourne. It would be a very good,94
NA,gesture on the .part of the Department of,94
NA,Immigration if officers of that department,94
NA,could visit areas where there are numbers,94
NA,"of immigrants with problems, in the same",95
NA,way as officers of the Repatriation Depart-,95
NA,ment go to places outside Melbourne to,95
NA,help people with their repatriation,95
NA,problems.,95
NA,"As the last speaker in this Budget debate,",95
NA,may I say that I feel that the Government,95
NA,and the Treasurer have presented a budget,95
NA,"which, despite initial criticism, will be",95
NA,recognized eventually by the Australian,95
NA,people as being in the best interests of this,95
NA,"country, just as other budgets of this",95
NA,Government have been recognized.,95

Mr DALY ,Grayndler) [11.4] - Mr usefulness.,96
NA,"Speaker, I wish to speak about a matter",96
NA,that has caused great concern and has been,96
NA,reported in the press at some length. I,96
NA,refer to certain allegations made by a,96
NA,vernment supporter against a senior,96
NA,ter of the Government. I have before me,96
NA,"a report in to-day's Melbourne "" Sun""",96
NA,"under the heading "" Relieve Hasluck",96
NA,"Office Urges M.H.R."". The honorable",96
NA,member concerned is the honorable memthe,96
NA,ber for Bowman ( Mr MCColm) who yesterParliamentary,96
NA,day in this place made certain disturbing,96
NA,allegations against the competence and,96
NA,PAIRS. administration of the Minister for Terri-,96
NA,tories ( Mr Hasluck). According to the,96
NA,press report the honorable member said-,96
NA,. . . the Minister's period of usefulness as,96
NA,Minister for Territories has come to an end.,96
NA,An almost complete lack of good public rela-,96
NA,"tions between the department, the Minister and",96
NA,the people has caused this position.,96
NA,Those are very grave and disturbing,96
NA,allegations by a Government supporter,96
NA,against a senior Minister in the Govern-,96
NA,ment. Not only has the honorable member,96
NA,"for Bowman attacked the Minister, but he",96
NA,has also attacked the Minister's Parlia-,96
NA,"mentary Secretary, the honorable member",96
NA,"for Calare ( Mr Howse), who has been the",96
NA,public relations consultant on this matter.,96
NA,In addition to the statement made by the,96
NA,"honorable member for Bowman, the",96
NA,honorable member for Mitchell ( Mr.,96
NA,accused the Minister of calling,96
NA,certain people in the Territory of Papua,96
NA,and New Guinea locusts. The Minister's,96
NA,exchanges with the honorable member for,96
NA,Mitchell during the course of the latter's,96
NA,speech were very disturbing to both the,96
NA,Scott Minister and honorable members generally.,96
NA,I see that the Prime Minister ( Mr Menzies),96
NA,is in the House. The Minister for Terri-,96
NA,for tories evidently does not intend to defend,96
NA,"himself, or perhaps he accepts the charges",96
NA,as true. The Prime Minister has made no,96
NA,"statement on them, and the honorable",96
NA,member for Bowman and the honorable,96
NA,member for Mitchell have not withdrawn,96
NA,n their allegations. Judging by the sour look,96
NA,on the face of the honorable member for,96
NA,"Bowman as I am speaking, I think that he",96
NA,will rise to his feet when I have finished,96
NA,my speech and confirm the fact that he,96
NA,thinks the Minister has outlived his,96
NA,"In fairness to the people of this country,",96
NA,and particularly to the people in the Terri-,96
NA,"Gotory, something should be done about the",96
NA,Minisallegations that have been made. The,96
NA,Minister should stand aside until such time,96
NA,as an investigation can establish whether,96
NA,of the charges made by the honorable mem-,96
NA,"bers can be substantiated. As I have said,",96
NA,allegations also refer to the Minister's,96
NA,"Secretary, the honorable",96
NA,member for Calare. He has held the posi-,96
NA,the tion of Parliamentary Secretary to the,96
NA,Minister for many years. We have come to,97
NA,know him in this Parliament as a man of,97
NA,"integrity, but nobody is defending him now",97
NA,-h e has not even spoken for himself. If,97
NA,his silence does nothing else it lends sub-,97
NA,"stance to the charges that have been made,",97
NA,and they require explanation.,97
NA,The Minister is receiving a big salary.,97
NA,I do not complain about that; but if he is,97
NA,"not a competent Minister, if he has lost the",97
NA,confidence of the people affected by his,97
NA,administration and if he no longer has the,97
NA,confidence of the rank and file of Govern-,97
NA,"ment supporters, there can be no excuse",97
NA,for his retention in the Ministry without,97
NA,"some, investigation being made.",97
NA,I have not had any personal differences,97
NA,with the Minister as he does not come much,97
NA,"within my ambit, but I do feel that in some",97
NA,matters regarding his administration he,97
NA,seems to overstep the mark. One of his,97
NA,most recent actions has been to interfere,97
NA,in the Northern Territory matrimonial,97
NA,affairs of a native girl and a man named,97
NA,Daly. I would have thought that this sub-,97
NA,"ject of Daly, Gladys, Arthur and Mr Ward",97
NA,was well outside the scope of the Minister.,97
NA,Quite frankly I am somewhat disturbed,97
NA,about this matter. I intended to ask the,97
NA,Minister specifically to state that I was not,97
NA,the Daly involved in this matter. I know,97
NA,"that my colleague, the honorable member",97
NA,for East Sydney ( Mr Ward) is disturbed,97
NA,because some people may think that he is,97
NA,the Ward in the case.,97
NA,I mention this matter because it shows,97
NA,that somewhere along the line the Minister,97
NA,"may be going off the beam. After all, it Is",97
NA,"taking things too far when, in the middle",97
NA,of a debate on matrimonial legislation de-,97
NA,"signed to maintain the family unit, the",97
NA,Minister is keeping lovers in the Northern,97
NA,"Territory apart. In other words, the allehad",97
NA,gations concerning the Minister's administravery,97
NA,tion of his department evidently have some,97
NA,substance in them and the Minister should,97
NA,be asked to explain his attitude and to state,97
NA,what foundation there is for the charges,97
NA,that have been made.,97
NA,"I mention this matter in passing, probably",97
NA,"somewhat humorously, but nonetheless with",97
NA,a certain degree of conviction that the,97
NA,Minister has overstepped the mark in,97
NA,respects in the Northern Territory. He,97
NA,not exactly inspired us with confidence in,97
NA,him by his handling of a matter as technical,97
NA,"as a love affair. Surely, the persons con-",97
NA,cerned have certain human rights. There-,97
NA,"fore, I ask the Prime Minister, who is in",97
NA,"the chamber, to take some action in rela-",97
NA,tion to the matter and to institute some,97
NA,sort of inquiry.,97
NA,I do not wish to speak at greater length,97
NA,"on this subject, because I note that other",97
NA,honorable members are anxious to discuss,97
NA,it. No doubt my colleague from East,97
NA,"Sydney would like to discuss it, because",97
NA,he is involved personally. I should like to,97
NA,hear the honorable member for Bowman,97
NA,"and the honorable member for Mitchell,",97
NA,who evidently have evidence to offer,97
NA,"against the Minister, state their case. When",97
NA,"all is said and done, the Minister has been",97
NA,charged by his own colleagues with being,97
NA,incompetent and not fit to carry out the,97
NA,work for which he has been chosen by,97
NA,the Prime Minister. Surely the Minister,97
NA,should be obliged to stand down until his,97
NA,administration is investigated and a full,97
NA,inquiry is made into the very grave and,97
NA,disturbing charges which have been levelled,97
NA,against him by very reputable supporters,97
NA,of the Government. I think we are entitled,97
NA,to have an answer to those charges. I ask,97
NA,"the Prime Minister to note my comments,",97
NA,particularly in relation to matters affecting,97
NA,"the Northern Territory, and, above all else,",97
NA,to exonerate me from any association with,97
NA,the Minister in a matrimonial event that,97
NA,occurred in the Territory. I ask that my,97
NA,"remarks be noted, that some evidence be",97
NA,furnished to the Parliament in support of,97
NA,"the charges made, and that a full investiga-",97
NA,tion be held into the Minister's adminis-,97
NA,tration so that justice shall be done to all.,97
Mr WARD ,East Sydney) [11.12] - I,97
NA,not intended to say anything about the,97
NA,interesting topic to which the honor-,97
NA,able member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) has,97
NA,directed attention. I commend him for,97
NA,"probing into it, but I cannot go the whole",97
NA,way with him in what he has had to say.,97
NA,I think he said that the Minister for Terri-,97
NA,tories ( Mr Hasluck) had outlived his use-,97
NA,fulness. I have yet to see evidence that he,97
NA,was ever useful at any time. I also dis-,97
NA,many agree with the effort of the honorable,97
NA,has member for Grayndler to involve the Prime,97
NA,"Minister ( Mr Menzies) in this episode,",98
NA,because I think it will be agreed that the,98
NA,great white rather has enough troubles of,98
NA,his own.,98
NA,I think there is another explanation,98
NA,the criticism of the Minister for Territories.,98
NA,I have no more regard for his capacity,98
NA,than I have for that of some other members,98
NA,"of the Cabinet, but I understand that the",98
NA,trouble in the Northern Territory at the,98
NA,"moment is that, whilst the Minister has to",98
NA,a laTge extent got away from the policy of,98
NA,"the previous Labour Government, he has",98
NA,not been going fast enough for big business.,98
NA,They want action. They want greater,98
NA,results from the big businessman's Govern-,98
NA,ment that now occupies the treasury bench.,98
NA,We know that in this Parliament there are,98
NA,paid lobbyists-peopl e who represent cerat,98
NA,tain interests. Apparently those interests,98
NA,have decided that the Minister for Terriother,98
NA,tories must be removed from his present,98
NA,portfolio or dismissed from the Cabinet,98
NA,altogether so that they may be able to deal,98
NA,with some one who will be more In,98
NA,favorably disposed towards them and,98
NA,who will accelerate the implementation,98
NA,of the policy that this Government,98
NA,is following in the Territories. I titlement,98
NA,think that what is required in regard to,98
NA,the Territories is not so much .an investigaThe,98
NA,tion of some small episode but a royal comcondition,98
NA,mission into what has been happening. If,98
NA,"a royal commission were appointed, I think",98
NA,the people of Australia would be rather,98
NA,"surprised by what was revealed, and I",98
NA,afraid that some members on the GovernOne,98
NA,ment side-thos e jackals who howl-woul,98
NA,not get the complete clearance from,98
NA,allegations that I was given. Honorable,98
NA,"members opposite may laugh, but I point",98
NA,out that I invited the appointment of a,98
NA,royal commission and that I went before,98
NA,I got a complete clearance from a judge have mentioned.,98
NA,who was appointed by a Liberal government,98
NA,and was not a Labour appointee.,98
NA,When allegations were made against,98
NA,"certain honorable member opposite, he",98
NA,asked for the matter to be referred to the,98
NA,Privileges Committee believing that he,98
NA,would be able to create the impression that,98
NA,he had been completely exonerated. I was,98
NA,told by .some honorable members on this,98
NA,side of the House who fell for this gimmick,98
NA,that he was getting around with a big,98
NA,"plaster on his neck. They were told,",98
NA,""" He has undergone a very serious",98
NA,operation. Don't continue your criticism,98
NA,"of him."" But as soon as he believed the",98
NA,of matter was out of the way and there was no,98
NA,"further talk about it, he had a miraculous",98
NA,recovery and the plaster was quickly re-,98
NA,"moved from his neck. It will be seen that,",98
NA,if we had the time at our disposal to delve,98
NA,"into these matters, we could probably make",98
NA,things rather uncomfortable for some honor-,98
NA,able members on the Government side. One,98
NA,of these nights when I feel disposed to do,98
NA,"it and I have a little more time, 1 shall pay",98
NA,some attention to those matters.,98
NA,My real purpose in rising was to refer to,98
NA,a most ridiculous decision that was arrived,98
NA,"by a repatriation tribunal. In my opinion,",98
NA,the decision equals in stupidity only one,98
NA,decision which was brought to my,98
NA,"notice some years ago, to which I referred",98
NA,in this House and in relation to which I,98
NA,gave particulars to the appropriate Minister.,98
NA,"that case the ex-serviceman concerned,",98
NA,whose claim had been rejected first by the,98
NA,Repatriation Board and then by the Re-,98
NA,"patriation Commission, went before an en-",98
NA,appeal tribunal. He was the worst,98
NA,case of shell shock that I have ever seen.,98
NA,authorities refused to recognize his,98
NA,as being a war caused disability.,98
NA,Eventually the appeal tribunal decided that,98
NA,he was suffering from shell shock but that,98
NA,it was not due to war service. Where does,98
NA,am one get shell shock other than at a war?,98
NA,of my colleagues nearly suggests that,98
NA,d he may have been a member of the Egg,98
NA,all Board! Honorable members opposite are,98
NA,always priding themselves on how many,98
NA,of them have a medal to wear on their coats,98
NA,"as an emblem of service, but they do not do",98
NA,it. very much about cases such as the one I,98
NA,I am interested in an unfortunate man,98
NA,who is suffering from a heart complaint and,98
NA,a who has lost a great deal of time at his,98
NA,work. On many occasions he has collapsed,98
NA,and has had to be taken to hospital for treat-,98
NA,"ment, but he has been unable to get the",98
NA,Repatriation Department to recognize his,98
NA,condition as being due to war service. He,98
NA,appealed to the entitlement appeal tribunal.,98
NA,I shall read the decision of the tribunal and,98
NA,I ask any honorable niember to state,99
NA,whether this man won his appeal or has,99
NA,lost it. The tribunal said-,99
NA,The appeal in respect of cardiovascular disease,99
NA,has been allowed. This decision does not,99
NA,"fer any entitlement or other benefit, nor does",99
NA,mean that the existence of any cardiovascular,99
NA,disease has been established. It merely indicates,99
NA,that the Repatriation Commission has not,99
NA,"beyond doubt, to the satisfaction of the tribunal,",99
NA,that you are not suffering from any incapacity,99
NA,from any cardiovascular disease.,99
NA,"This ex-serviceman asked me, "" Where do",99
NA,go from here? What comes next? My,99
NA,appeal has been allowed and I am losing,99
NA,"time at work, but I cannot get any benefit.",99
NA,I have not even had it established to,99
NA,satisfaction of the department that,99
NA,"suffering from the disease at all."" Unforadvanced.",99
NA,"tunately, this ex-serviceman collapsed",99
NA,only a few days ago and was taken to,99
NA,"pital. He got a medical certificate, the",99
NA,"original of which I have seen,",99
NA,"Cook of 51 Elizabeth Bay-road, Elizabeth",99
NA,"Bay, Sydney, which stated that he was under",99
NA,treatment for cardiovascular disease.,99
NA,spite of that and even though his appeal,99
NA,"was allowed, he has been unable to estabHouse",99
NA,lish to the satisfaction of the department,99
NA,that he should get appropriate treatment,99
NA,and a pension. I think that is a most,99
NA,ridiculous situation.,99
NA,In the few moments that,99
NA,refer to an anomaly in regard to the sickness,99
NA,and unemployment benefit. Let us conOrder!,99
NA,sider the case of a man who meets with an expired.,99
NA,industrial accident in relation to which the,99
NA,"question of compensation is disputed, and",99
NA,who is declared to be partially fit for work,99
NA,"or, to put it in another way, is fit for only",99
NA,light work. Because the compensation,99
NA,doctor decides that he is fit for light work,99
NA,-eve n though his own doctor declares him circulated:-,99
NA,to be completely incapacitated-an d,99
NA,because he cannot take any work then offer-,99
NA,ing he is not eligible for the unemployment,99
NA,benefit. Since he is not totally incapaciLabour,99
NA,"tated, but is declared to be fit for light",99
NA,"work, he cannot get even the sickness benemade",99
NA,fit. Some of these compensation cases are mission,99
NA,"fought over a period of many months, and,",99
NA,"as a consequence, some men, especially",99
NA,those who are married and have depend-,99
NA,ants find themselves in most distressed judge,99
NA,circumstances.,99
NA,I hope that the Minister for Social Ser-,99
NA,vices ( Mr Roberton) will examine this,99
NA,"anomaly. It is an anomaly, because I",99
NA,"imagine that if a man is incapacitated,",99
NA,conwhether by an industrial accident or sick-,99
NA,"it ness, he is qualified to receive some Com-",99
NA,monwealth benefit. If he is not entitled,99
NA,"to the sickness benefit, he ought to be paid",99
NA,"proved, the unemployment benefit. If he is not",99
NA,"eligible for the unemployment benefit, he",99
NA,ought to get the sickness benefit. Every-,99
NA,body knows that these men are not asking,99
NA,I for anything to which they would not nor-,99
NA,mally be entitled in the view of every,99
NA,reasonable citizen. If lump-sum compen-,99
NA,"sation is granted eventually, the Depart-",99
NA,the ment of Social Services always recoups,99
NA,I am itself for the money that has been,99
NA,"As I have said, many men who",99
NA,again are married and have dependants find,99
NA,hosthemselves in very distressing circum-,99
NA,stances while they are waiting for their,99
NA,from a Dr cases to be heard.,99
NA,One of these cases was brought to me,99
NA,by the compensation officer of the Labour,99
NA,In Council of New South Wales. I have not,99
NA,sufficient time to give the details to the,99
NA,"this evening, but I shall supply",99
NA,them to the Minister. I hope that he will,99
NA,take action to give relief in this individual,99
NA,case and also to the other people who are,99
NA,at present suffering unnecessarily because,99
NA,they are denied these Commonwealth social,99
NA,"remain, let me service benefits.",99
Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. John MCLeay) -,99
NA,The honorable member's time has,99
NA,Question resolved in the affirmative.,99
NA,House adjourned at 11.22 p.m.,99
NA,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS.,99
NA,The following answers to questions were,99
NA,Industrial Arbitration.,99
Mr REYNOLDS , the Minister for,99
NA,"and National Service, upon notice-",99
NA,1. Is it a fact that an application which was,99
NA,to the Conciliation and Arbitration Com-,99
NA,"on 14th June, 1957, on behalf of the",99
NA,professional officers of the Commonwealth Public,99
NA,Service for a new assessment of professional,99
NA,"engineers' salaries, is still unheard?",99
NA,2. Has consideration been finalized of the,99
NA,question of appointing at least one additional,99
NA,to the Bench to obviate any further delay,99
NA,in this and similar cases?,99
NA,Mr MCMahon -Th e answers to the,100
NA,honorable member's questions are as,100
NA,follows:-,100
NA,1. The application by the Professional Officers,100
NA,"Association was filed in June, 1957, with the",100
NA,"Public Service Arbitrator and was later, at the",100
NA,"request of the association, referred to the Con-",100
NA,ciliation and Arbitration Commission. As I have,100
NA,"pointed out previously, the claims not only of",100
NA,"this association, but of a number of other asso-",100
NA,"ciations in the "" white collar"" and professional",100
NA,"fields, are now before the Commission at the",100
NA,instance of the associations themselves and the,100
NA,President has done all in his power to find a,100
NA,means of expediting proceedings. Several attempts,100
NA,he made to cut corners were rejected by the,100
NA,claimant associations. The present position of,100
NA,the applications is that at a hearing before the,100
NA,"president of the commission, in mid-July, certain",100
NA,proposals were put forward by the Australian,100
NA,"Council of Trade Unions and the "" white collar """,100
NA,and professional associations namely that claims,100
NA,"affecting the metal trades, aircraft industry and",100
NA,bank officials' awards would be heard and claims,100
NA,"of the professional and "" white collar"" workers",100
NA,would be temporarily set aside. The President,100
NA,has listed the first-mentioned claims for 25th,100
NA,August. It is possible that a separate Bench will,100
NA,be constituted to carry forward the part-heard,100
NA,claims of the professional engineers: some aspects,100
NA,of their case are presently before the High Court.,100
NA,"2. As the honorable member is no doubt aware,",100
NA,the appointment of an additional Deputy Presi-,100

NA,Mr Ward asked the Mmister for Labour,100
NA,"and National Service, upon notice-",100
NA,1. How many (a) registered trade unions and (b),100
NA,"employers' organizations have been charged, con-",100
NA,victed and fined for contempt of court offences,100
NA,since the Government took office in 1949?,100
NA,2. What was the name of the organization con-,100
NA,"cerned, the nature of the charge and the penalty",100
NA,imposed in each case?,100
NA,3. How many (a) trade union and (b) employers',100
NA,"organization officials have been charged, gaoled, or",100

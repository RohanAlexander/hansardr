NA,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT.,20
NA,MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE.,20
NA,Debate resumed from 3rd July (vide '.,20
Mr WATT,,20
NA,That the paper be printed.,20
NA,"Upon which Mr HIGGS had moved, by",20
NA,way of amendment- -,20
NA,"That all the words after "" That"" be left",20

NA,"confidence of this House.""",20
Mr CONSIDINE ,Barrier) [11.3] -,20
NA,When the debate was adjourned last,20
NA,"evening, I was pointing out that the",20
NA,Ministerial statement-' presented by the,20
NA,Acting Prime Minister did not contain,20
NA,even a hint that the Government pro-,20
NA,posed to take any steps to deal with the,20
NA,Trusts and Combines which are operating,20
NA,"in the Commonwealth, .and which were",20
NA,so roundly condemned last evening by,20
NA,several Ministerial supporters. There can,20
NA,be no doubt that Trusts and Combines,20
NA,have Australia i n their grip. The Beef,20
NA,Trust is operating strongly i n the Com-,21
NA,monwealth to-day. I n a report pre-,21
NA,sented by a Commission appointed by the,21
NA,United States Government to inquire into,21
NA,the Chicago Meat Trust and its ramifica-,21
NA,"tions, quotations from which appeared i n",21
NA,the Barrier Daily Truth of 5th A p r i l,21
NA,"last, there is given a list of the operations",21
NA,of the Beef Trust i n various countries.,21
NA,According to the report of the Commis-,21
NA,"sion, Armour and Company, of the Meat",21
NA,"Trust, are represented in Australia and",21
NA,"New Zealand by Armour and Company,",21
NA,"of Australasia, and Swif t Company, also",21
NA,"members of the Trust, are represented",21
NA,in Australia by the Australian Meat Ex-,21
NA,port Company. The Commission reported,21
NA,that-,21
NA,Tlie Commission had to meet deliberate,21
NA,falsification of returns properly required under,21
NA,legal authority; we had to meet schools for,21
NA,"witnesses, where employees were coached in",21
NA,anticipation of their being called to testify in,21
NA,an investigation ordered by you (President,21
NA,Wilson) and by the Congress of the United,21
NA,States; we had to meet a situation created,21
NA,by the destruction of letters and documents,21
NA,vital to this investigation; we had to meet a,21
NA,conspiracy in the preparation of answers to the,21
NA,lawful inquiries of the Commission. The pub-,21
NA,"lic were told that no "" Trust"" existed, and that",21
NA,"the "" Big Five "" were in most effective compe-",21
NA,"tition, but the report declares that "" these five",21
NA,".corporations and their 500 odd subsidiary, con-",21
NA,"trolled, and affiliated companies, are bound",21
NA,"together by joint ownership, agreements,",21
NA,"understandings, communities of interest, and",21
NA,"family relationships."" In the three years",21
NA,1915-1916-1917 four of the five big concerns,21
NA,"made net profits amounting to Â£35,600,000, and",21
NA,it is stated that in 1917 their earnings were,21
NA,more than four times as much as in the year,21
NA,before the war.,21
NA,The Commission went on to say-,21
NA,I t is our opinion that the failure of American,21
NA,meat production to keep pace with population,21
NA,is in large measure due to the conditions,21
NA,created and maintained in tho markets by the,21
NA,Big Five.,21
NA,This may well be the Teason f o r the high,21
NA,cost of meat and other commodities i n,21
NA,Australia.,21
NA,I t has been denied f r o m time to time,21
NA,that the Meat Trust is' operating i n Aus-,21
NA,tralia. Here we have a Commission de-,21
NA,"claring, on unimpeachable testimony, that",21
NA,i t is operating not only i n America and,21
NA,"other countries, but i n Australia. Despite",21
NA,the fact that this evidence is in .the hands,21
NA,"of the Government, that all this informa-",21
NA,"tion is available to them, they show no dis-",21
NA,position to take any action i n regard to,21
NA,the Trust. A t this critical period i n our,21
NA,"history, when we are facing a readjust-",21
NA,ment of industry and thousands of work-,21
NA,less people do not know where they aTe to,21
NA,"obtain the next meal, the Government are",21
NA,still unprepared to do anything. The,21
NA,Ministerial statement deals with a number,21
NA,"of comparatively immaterial matters, but",21
NA,there is not even a hint i n i t that the Go-,21
NA,vernment intend to do anything to allevi-,21
NA,ate the necessities of the people or to deal,21
NA,with Trusts and Combines.,21
NA,I do not wish to weary honorable mem- .,21
NA,"bers by making long quotations, but I de-",21
NA,sire to place before them an extract f r o m,21
NA,"an article entitled "" The Simple Annals of",21
NA,"the Poor,"" which appeared i n the Age of",21
NA,"20th June last. This statement is made,",21
NA,"not by a Bolshevik or a red-ragger, but by",21
NA,a newspaper i n an article dealing w i th,21
NA,the work of the Ministering Children's,21
NA,League. Referring to a meeting held by,21
NA,"that League . i n the Town H a l l , the Age",21
NA,states that-,21
NA,I t was a pathetic picture of the lives of the,21
NA,"little children of parents who were "" inefficient",21
NA,"-no t very .good at anything,"" and whose help-",21
NA,less inefficiency was assumed to be largely due,21
NA,to stunted or ill-nurtured physiques. The,21
NA,"fathers have very poor earning capacity, and",21
NA,they are the first to be dismissed when work,21
NA,slackens.. Therefore their little ones know too,21
NA,"much about want. One child, just returned",21
NA,"from the Cottage by the Sea at Queenscliff,",21
NA,"met her mother with the cry, "" Mother, thero",21
NA,"was food left over after every meal!"" As",21
NA,"Sister Emilie, of the Central Methodist Mis-",21
NA,"sion, said, that one sentence revealed a terrible",21
NA,condition of affairs in that child's home.,21
NA,I t is only too tine that this state of affairs,21
NA,"relates not to the home of one child only,",21
NA,but is characteristic of thousands of,21
NA,homes in Australia to-day.,21
NA,The honorable member fo r Franklin,21
NA,( Mr MCWilliams) said last evening that,21
NA,several hundred soldiers had been pre-,21
NA,vented fro m returning to their homes i n,21
NA,Tasmania because of the action of Mr .,21
NA,"Walsh, general secretary of the Seamen's",21
NA,"Union, i n calling out the crew of the",21
NA,Wyandra. That statement illustrates tho,21
NA,".colossal hyprocrisy of the Government,",21
NA,who are trying to persuade the people that,21
NA,the seamen are the cause of the present,21
NA,"trouble. As a matter of fact, the Govern-",22
NA,ment are deliberately holding up the coal,22
NA,supply and trying to utilize the Seamen's,22
NA,"Union, just as they availed themselves of",22
NA,"the Eveleigh Workshops dispute in 1917,",22
NA,to starve the women and children of this,22
NA,"country, and to blame tlie workers for the",22
NA,"trouble, i n order to break down our indus-",22
NA,trial organization. They wish to remove,22
NA,the political representatives of the work-,22
NA,ing classes here. The country is being,22
NA,run at the present time by a gang of mur-,22
NA,dering thieves. I t is a conspiracy,22
Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. W . Elliot,22
NA,Johnson) - I ask the'honorable member,22
NA,to moderate his language.,22
Mr BLAKELEY , T h e language Ls not,22
NA,strong enough.,22
Mr SPEAKER , I would point out honorable,22
NA,to the honorable member that language,22
NA,can be forcible without being extravagant,22
NA,and grossly offensive.,22
Mr MAHONY ,Bu t women and childetermined.,22
NA,dren are starving !,22
NA,' . Mr . . $ PEAKER - 4: ask the,22
NA,member for Dalley ( Mr Mahony) not,22
NA,interject while the Speaker is on his feet.,22
Mr MAHONY ," W h y do not the Go-,",22
NA,vernment do something?,22
Mr SPEAKER ,Th e honorable mem-,22
NA,ber immediately repeats his breach of,22
NA,Standing Orders. I name the honorable,22
NA,member f o r Dalley f o r his persistency in,22
NA,defying the Chair.,22
Mr MAHONY , I do not care.. Women,22
NA,and children are starving.,22
Mr BLAKELEY ,Th e Government are,22
NA,set of canting humbugs and hypocrites.,22
Mr SPEAKER , I ask the honorable,22
NA,member for Darling ( Mr Blakeley),22
NA,cease his interjections.,22
NA,member for Dalley has had a few moments,22
NA,"to reflect, and I wish to give him",22
NA,opportunity to apologize to the House.,22
Mr WATT , W i t h your,22
NA,"Mr Speaker, may I interpose.",22
NA,regret that I was absent when the,22
NA,incident to which my attention has Darling,22
NA,been directed took place.,22
NA,tirely ignorant of its nature except,22
NA,I am given to understand by my honorI,22
NA,able colleague ( Mr.,22
NA,interjections have been made i n defiance,22
NA,of the order of the Chair. That is not,22
NA,uncommon when feeling runs high. B u t,22
NA,it is also a very common incident that:,22
NA,when honorable members have had time to,22
NA,"reflect, they see the wisdom of obeying the",22
NA,"Chair, no matter on what side of the",22
NA,"House they sit. I take this opportunity,",22
NA,"Mr Speaker, to supplement your appeal",22
NA,to the honorable member that he will obey,22
NA,"the ruling of the Chair, as all honorable-",22
NA,members from the Leader of theHouse,22
NA,downwards have to do.,22
Mr MAHONY , I feel that I cannot,22
NA,withdraw from the attitude that I have,22
NA,taken up. There are thousands of women,22
NA,and children starving i n this country and,22
NA,the Government are doing nothing. I ',22
NA,absolutely refuse to withdraw from the,22
NA,position taken up by me.,22
Mr SPEAKER , I would remind the,22
NA,"member and the House,",22
NA,"generally that, whatever the reason may",22
NA,"be for the action taken by him, i t",22
NA,is entirely apart fromthe question to be-,22
NA,The rules of the House are,22
NA,"being flagrantly ignored and disregarded,,",22
NA,honorable and I must look to the support of,22
NA,"to honorable members in demanding their,",22
NA,due observance. I hope that the honor-,22
NA,able member will recognise that i t is his',22
NA,duty to withdraw from the attitude he has^,22
NA,adopted. .,22
Mr MAHONY ," N o , I am not goingj",22
NA,the to withdraw. The welfare of the women-,22
NA,and children is more to me.,22
Mr WATT , M a y I offer a few ad-,22
NA,"ditional words. I am not permitted, nor",22
NA,"is any honorable member, to discuss the",22
NA,merits of the views of the honorable,22
NA,a member for Dalley ( Mr Mahony) as ex-,22
NA,pressed i n 'his interjection. I f I were I,22
NA,would tell 'him that the Government has,22
NA,"to done and is prepared to do a great deal,",22
NA,The honorable .as tlie Leader of the Opposition ( Mr .,22
NA,"Tudor) himself knows. That, however, is",22
NA,an not the question before the House.,22
Mr BLAKELEY ,Th e trouble is that,22
NA,"concurrence, you have done nothing.",22
Mr WATT , I t would be very much,22
NA,better i f the honorable member for,22
NA,( Mr Blakeley) would al'ow this,22
NA,I am enmatter to be settled as beween the Chair,22
NA,that and the honorable member concerned.,22
NA,t is only a question now of obedience to,22
NA,Groom) that the invariable traditions of the Chair and,22
NA,of orderly conduct. I f the honorable,22
NA,member were the occupant of the Chair;,22
NA,he would have to enforce the rules of de-,23
NA,bate even against members of his own,23
NA,political views.,23
Mr MAHONY , I f you tell me that you,23
NA,are going to do something to relieve the,23
NA,"distress, I will withdraw.",23
Mr WATT , I cannot obtrude the,23
NA,merits of the question at this stage.,23
Mr MAHONY ,The n I ehall not with-,23
NA,draw.,23
Mr WATT , B u t the Leader of the,23
NA,Opposition knows that the door is open,23
NA,"to him, and all those associated with him,",23
NA,to put views of that kind i n a proper way,23
NA,"to the Government. I f they are so put,",23
NA,"they will be duly considered,",23
NA,promptly attended to. I appeal to the,23
NA,better judgment of the honorable member,23
NA,for Dalley to respond to the direction of,23
NA,the Chair.,23
Mr MAHONY , I shall not withdraw.,23
Mr SPEAKER ,The n I have no,23
NA,alternative but to call upon the Leader,23
NA,of the House to take the necessary action,23
NA,to enforce observance of the Standing,23
NA,Orders of the House.,23
Mr WATT , T h e very unpleasant duty,23
NA,is cast upon the acting head of the Go-,23
NA,vernment of moving-,23
NA,That the honorable member for Dalley '( Mr.,23
NA,Mahony) be suspended from the service ot,23
NA,the House.,23
NA,"I take this action very reluctantly, be-",23
NA,cause I am sure tlie honorable member,23
NA,and his colleagues feel that this incident,23
NA,"is unfortunate, and should not be pursued.",23
NA,"However, no alternative is l e f t to me, and",23
NA,' I move accordingly.,23
Mr BLAKELEY ,Th e condition of these,23
NA,women and children is more unfortunate.,23
Mr SPEAKER ,Befor e putting the,23

Mr SPEAKER , I remind bhe honor-,23

NA,. . 30 ' offensive reflection npon the Government,23
NA,. . 15 of the country by describing them as '* a,23
NA,"murdering gang of thieves.""",23
Mr BLAKELEY , I t is hypocritical cant,23
NA,for them to say they are doing something,23

NA,done nothing.',24
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! I remind,24
NA,the House,24

NA,(Sitting suspended from 11.25 to,24
NA,11.40 a.m.),24
Mr SPEAKER ,I n the interests of,24

NA,I took the somewhat unusual course of,24
NA,suspending the .sitting,24
Mr BLAKELEY ,Thes e are unusual,24
NA,"times, sir.",24
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! I took the,24
NA,Somewhat unusual course of suspending,24
NA,the sitting in order to afford some honor-,24
NA,able members sufficient time for calm re-,24
NA,flection in the hope that they would recog-,24
NA,nise the seriousness of the position that,24
NA,was developing. One of the duties im-,24
NA,"posed upon me, as the presiding oflicer of",24
NA,"the House, is to see that the rules",24
NA,spected. ' I must therefore ask the honor-,24
NA,"able member for Barrier ( Mr Considine),",24
NA,now that he has had ample time for re-,24
NA,"flection, to withdraw the words of which",24
NA,complaint was made at the time of the,24
NA,interruption of our proceedings.,24
NA,"Mr Cor. srDiNE - I am very sorry, sir,",24
NA,T,24
NA,that I cannot see my way clear to comply,24
NA,"with your request, because I consider that",24
NA,the condition of tbe people outside this,24
NA,House warrants any breach of our parlia-,24
NA,mentary procedure in order to draw atten-,24
NA,tion to it.,24
Mr SPEAKER , I do hope that the,24
NA,honorable member will not continue to,24
NA,adopt that attitude. I would rather not,24
NA,"have to proceed to extreme measures,",24
NA,tlierefore I will give the honorable memto live.,24
NA,ber another opportunity to withdraw be-,24
NA,fore calling on the Acting Prime Minister,24
NA,( Mr Wiatt) to take action.,24
Mr WATT ,"Ma y I be permitted, with",24
NA,"the consent of the House, to add just",24
NA,"few words to the appeal which you, sir, agents.",24
NA,have made. The honorable member for,24
NA,Barrier knows perfectly well that the,24
NA,relating to the preservation of order,24
NA,imperative in a deliberative assembly,24
NA,this character. I will therefore say-al -,24
NA,though it niay possibly be regarded by,24
NA,"you as irrelevant-that , as far as the",24
NA,Grovernment is concerned in its relation,24
NA,"inter- to the present distress, it has responded to",24
NA,every appeal which has been made to it.,24
Mr MCDONALD , I do not like to inter-,24
NA,"rupt the Acting Prime Minister, but I de-",24
NA,sire to know whether other honorable,24
NA,members will be afforded an equal oppor-,24
NA,tunity with him to make a speech on this,24
NA,matter ?,24
Mr SPEAKER ,Th e honorable mem-,24
NA,"ber for Kennedy ( Mr MCDonald), who",24
NA,has occupied the position of Speaker him-,24
NA,"self, knows that in circumstances such as",24
NA,"have arisen, the duty devolves upon the",24
NA,Acting Prime Minister to take r certain,24
NA,"course of action, and it has been the usual",24
NA,"practice in this House to permit him, be-",24
NA,"fore taking such action, to make an appeal",24
NA,to the honorable member affected so as,24
NA,to give him a further opportunity to set,24
NA,himself right with the House.,24
Mr WATT , I do not desire to traverse,24
NA,in a speech any of the main arguments,24
NA,are. rethat have been used by the honorable,24
NA,"member, but merely to add that the Go-",24
NA,vernment desire to co-operate with the,24
NA,State Governments in the relief of dis-,24
NA,tress all over Australia. I cannot say,24
NA,"anything more than that, but I think",24
NA,that I am permitted by the general judg-,24
NA,ment of the Hou3e to make that state-,24
NA,ment. I therefore appeal to the honor-,24
NA,able member for Barrier to obey the,24
NA,ruling of the Chair- a course which wÂ©,24
NA,all have' to adopt in circumstances of this,24
NA,kind.,24
Mr HIGGS ,Thi s would not have oc-,24
NA,curred if the Government had protected,24
NA,the public against profiteering.,24
Mr BLAKELEY ,W e do not want,24
NA,"and charity, but merely work and the right",24
Mr CONSIDINE , I cannot withdraw,24
NA,"the statement which I made, because I",24
NA,believe that it is true. This country is,24
NA,"being ruled by Trusts and Combines, and",24

Mr WATT , A s efforts at conciliation,25

Mr BLAKELEY ,Brothe r Burchell w i l l,25

Mr BURCHELL , I am quite pre-,25
NA,pared to do so. As testimony i n my mind,25
NA,"must be the truth, I hope the honorable",25
NA,member w i l l take my testimony i n that,25
NA,way.,25
Mr BLAKELEY , T h e honorable mem-,25
NA,ber is behind the gang of profiteers.,25
Mr BURCHELL , I am quite pre-,25
NA,pared to answer for my actions to the,25
NA,people who control my attendance i n this,25
NA,Parliament. I t is not f o r the honorable,25
NA,member to control me. I should like to,25
NA,say to the honorable member that I have,25
NA,never once i n this session interjected while,25
NA,another honorable member has been speak-,25
NA,ing. I ask honorable members opposite,25
NA,to give me the same consideration as I,25
NA,"17 give them, and no more. We know that",25
NA,AYES. i t is the duty of an Opposition to criticise,25
NA,"the Government. A t different times,",25
NA,"during their political career, honorable",25
NA,members opposite have availed themselves,25
NA,of opportunities to criticise the actions of,25
NA,the Government. While I agree that that,25
NA,is quite i n accordance w i t h parliamentary,25
NA,"procedure, I do not think that the criti -",25
NA,cism'of the Government should be merely,25
NA,destructive criticism. Whilst an Oppo-,25
NA,sition w i l l naturally direct attention to,25
NA,the faults which every Government is,25
NA,"f r o m time to time guilty of, whether i t be",25
NA,a Government of the Official Labour party,25
NA,"or of the party now i n power, we have",25
NA,a right to expect f r o m them something of,25
NA,NOES. a constructive character. I regret that,25
NA,the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr .,25
NA,"Higgs), when he moved the motion of",25
NA,"want of confidence, did not offer any con-",25
NA,structive criticism of the Government. I,25
NA,listened to the honorable gentleman very,25
NA,"closely, but he did not suggest any way in",25
NA,which the government of the country,25
NA,might be carried on to give effect to the,25
NA,"object we all have i n view, the good of the",25
NA,general community. I was surprised,25
NA,that he did not refer to the financial pro-,25
NA,posals of the Government. I t is true that,25
NA,"he asked a question, without notice, to dis-",25
NA,cover whether the Treasurer ( Mr W a t t ),25
NA,intended to visit England i n connexion,25
NA,w i th the pooling of the war debts of the,25
NA,"Allies, but he did not, i n his speech on",25
NA,"this motion, offer any criticism of the",25
NA,"financial proposals of the Government, or",25
NA,i n connexion w i th the proposed amend-,25
NA,ment of the T a r i f f . There are many,25
NA,things in the Ministerial statement.,25
Mr BLAKELEY , B u t nothing with re-,26
NA,"gard to profiteering, and the honorable",26
NA,member stands by that.,26
Mr BURCHELL ,Perhap s the hon-,26

NA,"to say that, in the printed document",26
NA,"setting out the Government's proposals,",26
NA,there are many matters which should,26

NA,"instance, the question of 'shipbuild-.",26
NA,"ing, aud the fact that",26
NA,one of the planks of the Labour,26
NA,"platform, a Commonwealth owned line of",26
NA,"steamers, has been put into operation.",26
NA,But we did not have one word of com-,26
NA,mendation on this matter from the,26
NA,Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr.,26
NA,Higgs)'. Reference is made also to tbe,26
NA,Navigation Act passed by the Labour,26
NA,party in 1910-13. Concerning this we have,26
NA,simply had the criticism that i t has not,26
NA,been proclaimed up to date; but we,26
NA,been told quite distinctly by the Governrobbed.,26
NA,ment that i t is their intention to amend,26
NA,the Ac t in a way which experience has,26
NA,"shown to be necessary, and",26
NA,subsequent to these amendments being,26
NA,"passed by Parliament, the Government",26
NA,intend to proclaim the Act . Honorable,26
NA,members know very well that the Ac t has standing.,26
NA,not been proclaimed because of a request,26
NA,"made by the Imperial Government, at",26
NA,"about the time when the war broke out,",26
NA,that thisaction should not be taken.,26
NA,first intimation made by the Government,26
NA,after the signing of peace is that i t is-,26
NA,their intention to take certain steps t o,26
NA,amend the measure ancl then have i t pro-',26
NA,claimed. But that does not satisfy,26
NA,honorable members opposite. I do not,26
NA,desire to refer to anything which the hon-.,26
NA,orable member for Darling ( Mr Blakeley),26
NA,"has said, except his statement that the",26
NA,* Acting Prime Minister may now be re-,26

Mr BLAKELEY , I know at all events,27

Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! I,27
NA,"several times called for order, particularly",27
NA,from certain honorable members who,27
NA,-have been persistent i n their interjec-,27
NA,tions. Perhaps they are not acquainted,27
NA,"with the Standing Orders, and I may be",27
NA,permitted to direct their attention to,27
NA,"standing order 58, which reads-",27
NA,". No member shall converse aloud, or make",27
NA,.any noise or disturbance whilst any member,27
NA,"is speaking, or whilst any Bill, Order, or other",27

NA,such noise and disturbance being persisted in,27
NA,"after the Speaker has called to order, the",27
NA,Speaker shall call upon the member making,27
NA,"such disturbance by name, and such niember",27
NA,will incur the displeasure and censure of the,27
NA,House.,27
NA,I remind honorable members tliat these,27
NA,are not the Speaker's Standing Orders.,27
NA,They are the Standing Orders of the,27
NA,"House, and members should maintain the",27
NA,reputation and honour of their own i n -,27
NA,stitution by observing their own Standing,27
NA,Orders. I hope this will be done.,27
Mr BURCHELL ," I have, amongst",27
NA,"my notes, references to the cost of living",27
NA,"and industrial unrest, and I intend to",27
NA,use them in their proper order. I am,27
NA,-sorry i f anything I have said has given,27
NA,"honorable members cause to interrupt,",27
NA,l>ut I hope now to be allowed to resume,27
NA,my remarks.,27
NA,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition,27
NA,in the course of his speech told us that,27
NA,-the demobilization of Australian soldiers,27
NA,.was expedited because the men had - re-,27
NA,volted. He did not say when or where,27
NA,Australian soldiers had revolted against,27
NA,the delay.,27
Mr YATES ,Bu t I can.,27
NA,'Field Artillery Brigade 4n France .pro-,27
NA,"""fcested against being' sent; to - Belgium",27
NA,"<3eneraT Brown was brought there', and i t",27
NA,the took him all his time to keep things,27
NA,"straight - As a result, they were not sent",27
NA,to the place they expected to 'be eent to.,27
Mr BURCHELL , D i d that expedite,27
NA,their return to Australia?,27
Mr YATES , I cannot say that. You,27
NA,can ask Bessell-Browne whether what I,27
NA,have said is a fact or not?,27
Mr BURCHELL , I thank the hon-,27
NA,"orable member for his interjection, and",27
NA,the information given. I am well aware,27
NA,of the fact that British troops revolted,27
NA,against an order for their return to,27
NA,have France after the armistice was signed. I,27
NA,"know also that Canadian troops revolted,",27
NA,"and broke up camp in Wales, because",27
NA,they were not being 6ent home; but never,27
NA,once did I hear of .Australian troops,27
NA,getting out of hand owing to delays,27
NA,"in demobilization, and that was the",27
NA,main theme i n the statement made,27
NA,by the Deputy Leader of the Opposi-,27
NA,"tion. He said that, because of a",27
NA,"revolt on the part of certain troops, the",27
NA,Government took action to speed up the,27
NA,machinery for demobilization. I say that,27
NA,i t was not so.,27
Mr HIGGS ,"D o you sa;V that, the sol-",27
NA,diers were satisfied .with being kept i n the,27
NA,Old Country?,27
Mr BURCHELL , T h a t is not the,27
NA,question; and that is not what the hon-,27
NA,orable member said. 1 am dealing with,27
NA,his statement concerning the demobiliza-,27
NA,tion arrangements.,27
Mr YATES , D i d they not cause,27
NA,trouble because they were being sent away,27
NA,without their leave?,27
Mr BURCHELL ," I a.m not, .Ware",27
NA,"that any were sent away without le^,ye...",27

Mr BURCHELL , T h e 'Deputy Leader,27
NA,of the Opposition referred also' to' Mr .,27
NA,-Keith Murdoch and the' Sun newspaper.,27
NA,"I ""had the privilege"" of meeting Mr Mur-",27
NA,"The 13th doch on several occasions, and I can' speak",27
NA,"of him as an excellent''type of Australian,",27
NA,-holding' Aifstralia's ' end' lip very - credit-,27
NA,"ably"" i n -London/ But having-said that,' I",27
NA,want now to say that good as were,28
NA,Mr Murdoch's opportunities for ob-,28
NA,"taining information, i t was not al-",28
NA,ways possible for him to go to the,28
NA,"best source, and that,",28
NA,his .periodical letters to certain news-,28
NA,papers i n this country were hut the ex-,28
NA,"pressions of opinion of Mr Murdoch, and",28
NA,of nobody else. We all know that i n,28
NA,Australia we have different view-points,28
NA,"on matters of immediate importance, and",28
NA,in just the same way i t may be assumed,28
NA,that Mr Keith Murdoch's view-points,28
NA,differ from those of other well informed,28
NA,people i n the Old Country. I t is rather,28
NA,unfortunate that the Deputy Leader of,28
NA,"the Opposition referred to >bhe Sun, be-",28
NA,cause I find the following from Mr Mur-,28
NA,"doch i n that journal on 25th February,",28
NA,1919 :-,28
NA,"The shipyard strikes are delaying 0,000 Aus-",28
NA,"tralians in England, and causing keen disap-",28
NA,pointment amongst the troops.,28
NA,Monash has ascertained the views of the men,28
NA,"awaiting passages, who include a large pro-",28
NA,"portion of unionists, with the result that arti-",28
NA,sans have freely volunteered to fit the ships.,28
NA,Tliese men wore immediately engaged on two,28
NA,"vessels, sent to -the southern ports from Lon-",28
NA,"don. Tliey receive union wages, besides their",28
NA,"military allowance, and are working vigorously.",28
NA,"I quote that to show that Mr Murdoch,",28
NA,"i n Ids capacity as a pressman, is also pre-",28
NA,pared to see the other side of an argu-,28
NA,"ment, and that while he wrote in Decem-",28
NA,ber of certain things that were not being,28
NA,done as expeditiously as might be desired,28
NA,"-afte r aU, but an expression of opinion",28
NA,on his part-whe n i t came to a question,28
NA,"of fitting up ships he was prepared to,",28
NA,"faithfully , advise the'people of Australia",28
NA,what was being done.,28
NA,We had a further statement f r o m the,28
NA,"Deputy Leader of the Opposition, that",28
NA,' instructions had been issued by the Go-,28
NA,vernment to send our soldiers back to this,28
NA,"country at the rate of 15,000 per month",28
NA,".for a certain .period, and that for the",28
NA,"balance of the time only 10,000 a month",28
NA,were to be sent. I have it from,28
NA,Director^General of Demobilization,28
NA,"sonally, and quite straight; that the pro-",28
NA,"posals of the Government were for 12,000",28
NA,"to be sent in December, 14,000 in Janu-",28
NA,"ary, 16,000 in February, and so on, in-",28
NA,"creasing by 2,000 per month until .the",28
NA,Mr Burchell.,28
NA,whole of the men were returned. Yet the,28
NA,Deputy Leader of the Opposition stated,28
NA,that the Government deliberately pre-,28
NA,vented men f r o m returning to their,28
NA,"after all, homes.",28
Mr HIGGS , H o w does the honorable,28
NA,member 'know what was proposed? H a d,28
NA,he access to official documents?,28
Mr BURCHELL ," I know, because I",28
NA,wa3 working there. I t was part of the,28
NA,"ordinary routine of my business, as a",28
NA,"military officer, and connected w i th",28
NA,"military demobilization work, to know",28
NA,this.,28
NA,NA,28
NA,formation must have been obtained f r o m,28
NA,"a good source, because all his reports were",28
NA,most reliable.,28
Mr BURCHELL , I have not at-,28
NA,tempted to disparage Mr Keith Murdoch.,28
NA,I have said that he is an excellent type of,28
NA,"General Australian, and I give h i m all credit f o r",28
NA,what he has done. Knowing h i m per-,28
NA,"sonally, I would be lacking i n m y sense of",28
NA,honour i f I did not pay him this compli-,28
NA,"ment; but I also say that, after all, Mr .",28
NA,Keith Murdoch's views are but an ex-,28
NA,pression of opinion from one man.,28
NA,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition,28
NA,( Mr Higgs) sees things from one point of,28
NA,"view, while I , perhaps, view them from",28
NA,another angle. I t is no reflection upon,28
NA,"the honorable member, then, when I say",28
NA,that my views and opinions do not tally,28
NA,with his.,28
Mr HIGGS , Mr Keith Murdoch re-,28
NA,fers to official documents.,28
NA,NA,28
NA,"sequent events, his information must have",28
NA,"been from official documents, because i t",28
NA,was true.,28
Mr BURCHELL , I have quoted,28
NA,"what were the instructions given, and ar-",28
NA,rangements attempted to be carried out,28
NA,by the Demobilization Department.,28
NA,NA,28
NA,"the soldiers ever had. He told the t r u t h ,",28
NA,the anyway.,28
Mr BURCHELL , I am not prepared,28
NA,to admit that he is the best friend of the,28
NA,"soldiers, but he is a very good one. I do",28
NA,"not, however, want to discuss Mr K e i t h",28
NA,Murdoch. The point is that the arrange-,28
NA,"ments made were that, during December,",28
NA,"14,000 men should he sent away. I n mis-",29
NA,"take, I gave the figure just now ae 12,000",29
NA,"men. There were to be 16,000 sent i n",29
NA,"January; 18,000 i n February; and so on,",29
NA,"increasing by 2,000 each month. Those",29
NA,arrangements were made i n December.,29
NA,Mr Keith Murdoch wrote his letter on,29
NA,8th December; but the arrangements of,29
NA,the Demobilization Department with the,29
NA,Shipping Comptroller were upon the basis,29
NA,I have quoted. The Government have,29
NA,been charged that they deliberately,29
NA,blocked men from coming home. They,29
NA,did nothing of the sort.,29
NA,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition,29
NA,quoted certain figures regarding the num-,29
NA,"ber of men despatched during December,",29
NA,"January, and February. Those figures,",29
NA,"I believe, are correct. They are certainly",29
NA,not up to the totals which I have ju6t,29
NA,"quoted, the reason being that the I m -",29
NA,perial Government could not provide the,29
NA,ships. The Shipping Comptroller could not,29
NA,keep anywhere near to his original agree-,29
NA,ment w i th the Australian Militar y,29
NA,authorities. I n regard to the figures,29
NA,"which Mr Higgs quoted, i t must be kept",29
NA,i n mind that i u February there was a,29
NA,tremendous slump. The total went down,29
NA,"to about 4,000 or 5,000 men. That was",29
NA,directly due to the great strike through-,29
NA,out the United Kingdom among the men,29
NA,responsible for refitting and finishing the,29
NA,fittings on troopships. I t was not a ques-,29
NA,"tion of a strike among waterside workers,",29
NA,"as we know that body i n Australia, or of",29
NA,a strike of seamen; i t affected carpenters,29
NA,and artisans. The trouble was not settled,29
NA,in London and Southampton u n t i l some,29
NA,considerable time after matters had be-,29
NA,come normal in other ports. We f e l t the,29
NA,"effect of the strike i n February, mainly",29
NA,because tlie ships which had been allotted,29
NA,to the Australian troops by the Shipping,29
NA,Comptroller were i n the Thames and at,29
NA,Southampton Docks. That fact explains,29
NA,the fall i n the February returns. General,29
NA,Monash-a s Mr Murdoch cabled in the,29
NA,extract which I have just quoted-know -,29
NA,ing that the Australians would include,29
NA,"a very large number of unionists, and",29
NA,"that they would not desire, unless circum-",29
NA,"stances were very grave, to attempt to",29
NA,"take the places of the men on strike,",29
NA,simply put the whole case before the men,29
NA,"themselves. I know, from personal con-",29
NA,"tact with the situation, that he stated",29
NA,the position to the men who were to come,29
NA,"home on one ship i n particular, and that",29
NA,"was the Euripides. H e said, i n effect,",29
NA,""" There is the ship at Tilbury Docks at",29
NA,"the present"""" moment. I cannot control",29
NA,the strike. I am not i n any sense respon-,29
NA,"sible for i t . On the other hand, I cannot",29
NA,secure a vessel from the Shipping Comp-,29
NA,troller to replace that ship. I t is for you,29
NA,.men now to say whether you will take the,29
NA,"place of those who are not at work, and",29
NA,prepare the ship to be sent home witb,29
NA,"yourselves on board."" Thereupon a",29
NA,number of the Australian troops con-,29
NA,cerned undertook to fit that ship as well,29
NA,as others; and that is how the difficulty,29
NA,"was overcome. Moreover, . Mr Keith",29
NA,Murdoch told the Australian people on,29
NA,the 28th February that that was so; and,29
NA,"I can support what he wrote, because i t",29
NA,was an absolute fact.,29
NA,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition,29
NA,made another statement to the effect tliat,29
NA,strong pressure would secure ships.,29
Mr HIGGS ,Tha t is what Mr Mur-,29
NA,doch said. I t is a quotation f r o m one of,29
NA,his articles.,29
Mr BURCHELL , I beg the honor-,29
NA,able member's pardon. I was under the,29
NA,impression that he had made i t as his,29
NA,"own statement. I only know this, that -",29
NA,"General Monash and his staff, and Mr .",29
NA,"Hughes on every conceivable occasion,",29
NA,and Sir Joseph Cook at every opportu-,29
NA,"nity , did their utmost to get shipping from",29
NA,the Comptroller. Honorable' members op-,29
NA,"posite, however, should place themselves",29
NA,in the shoes of the Comptroller. That,29
NA,official had not only the Australians to,29
NA,consider-h e had to provide for the trans-,29
NA,port of food supplies to England. He,29
NA,knew that there was food to be got f r o m,29
NA,the United States and Canada. H e was,29
NA,compelled to bring the foodstuffs f r o m,29
NA,"the nearest points first, in, order to re-",29
NA,lieve the tension. British public opinion,29
NA,would never have stood f or an official who,29
NA,"would say, "" Let us put all the ships on thc",29
NA,Australian run. Let us send all the Aus-,29
NA,tralian troops home i n them. There is,29
NA,- food to be got from Australia; but I w i l l,29
NA,admit that the ships w i l l be away f o r six,29
NA,"montlis, while, i f I were to send vessels",30
NA,to Canada they would be there and back,30
NA,"with foodstuffs within a month."" We",30
NA,"should endeavour to realize, also, some of",30
NA,the difficulties which our representatives,30
NA,"in the Old Country have been, and are,",30
NA,up against. I t is not simply a case of,30
NA,"putting up their hands and saying, "" We",30
NA,"demand the ships."" Mr Keith Murdoch",30
NA,knew that as well as I did. General,30
NA,Wisdom was appointed to take charge of,30
NA,transportation organization. I met him,30
NA,"a few days before I left London, and I",30
NA,sliall mention what was said at that meet-,30
NA,ing merely to indicate the attitude of re-,30
NA,sponsible officials concerning demobiliza-,30
NA,tion.. General Wisdom was in high glee,30
NA,"He said, "" I have just secured another",30
NA,3hip which the Canadians had had on,30
NA,"offer, hut which they have not been able",30
NA,to use. I have persuaded the Shipping,30
NA,Comptroller to turn i t over to the use of,30
NA,"the Australians; and, although i t means",30
NA,that we must prepare our draft and make,30
NA,ready all the necessary information after,30
NA,"the men have been selected, and that we",30
NA,shall have only five days in which to do,30
NA,"it, I have nevertheless agreed that we",30
NA,"shall fill the ship and send her out."" That",30
NA,"officer has been right through the mill,",30
NA,starting as a major and finishing as a,30
NA,brigadier. He knows the game. He,30
NA,. knew what the Australian soldiers,30
NA,wanted. He was so keen over getting,30
NA,that extra ship that he showed his grati-,30
NA,fication in unmistakable manner. While,30
NA,honorable members in this House criti-,30
NA,cise the Government and hold them re-,30
NA,"sponsible, tbey must remember that the",30
NA,individual administrative duties in Lon-,30
NA,don are being performed by men who are,30
NA,as keen to get the Australian soldier back,30
NA,home' as anybody out here in Australia.,30
NA,Mr Hides -Why was it that,30
NA,speeding up of our soldiers happened,30
NA,only after Mr Keith Murdoch's expose?,30
Mr BURCHELL , I do not agree,30
NA,that that was the case. Let us examine,30
NA,the various dates. On 8th December,30
NA,Mr Murdoch wrote from the Old them-no,30
NA,"Country, and' January's figures showed",30
NA,an increase over those of December.,30
Mr HIGGS ,"O f one or two thousands,",30
NA,perhaps.,30
Mr BURCHELL ,Tha t is so; and,30
NA,then came the slump during February.,30
NA,"After that, followed the increase in",30
NA,March and the subsequent continued in-,30
NA,creases ever since.,30
Mr BLAKELEY ,Th e honorable mem-,30
NA,ber also explained that our men fitted,30
NA,the ships themselves; so that could not,30
NA,have been placed as an obstacle. Ac-,30
NA,cording to the honorable member there,30
NA,was only one ship.,30
Mr BURCHELL , I stated that I,30
NA,knew positively of the Euripides. That,30
NA,happened to be because I had been placed,30
NA,on the boat roll to sail on the vessel. I,30
NA,might add that it'was owing to influenza,30
NA,-that I was unable to travel upon her.,30
Mr YATES ,Whe n you did come,30
NA,"home, did you sleep in a hammock? -",30
Mr BURCHELL , I did not.,30
Mr BLAKELEY ,No t likely! Officers',30
NA,cots!,30
Mr BURCHELL ,Th e honorable,30
NA,member need not worry about that. I,30
NA,invite him to consider the statement of,30
NA,"General Monash, made on 26th Novem-",30
NA,ber. The Deputy Leader of the,30
NA,Opposition said Sir John Monash,30
NA,addressed senior officers of the corps,30
NA,"on 26th November, after receiving in-",30
NA,structions from - the Government. He,30
NA,may be interested to know that General,30
NA,Monash and Mr Hughes did not meet,30
NA,from the date of the signing of the Armis-,30
NA,tice until 1st December. The honorable,30
NA,"gentleman said, further, that General",30
NA,Monash would never dare to deliver an,30
NA,address to his senior officers. That makes,30
NA,me smile. Sir John Monash is a wise,30
NA,man. He called his senior officers and,30
NA,"others together and said, "" I have been",30
NA,asked by the Government to accept the,30
NA,the responsibility of demobilizing the Aus-,30
NA,"tralian troops."" Then he went into the",30
NA,"whole thing with them. As I see it,",30
NA,they had a round-table discussion. The,30
NA,"problems would range from "" A "" to",30
NA,""" Z "" ; and General Monash placed those",30
NA,problems before his officers as he saw,30
NA,t as instructions from the Go-,30
NA,"vernment, but as a Corps Commander.",30
NA,"After hearing the views of 'his officers he,",30
NA,"no doubt, went to London strengthened",30
NA,with a knowledge of what would be best,30
NA,"f r o m the point of view, of France's in-",31
NA,terests. Then he met the Prime Minis-,31
NA,"ter ( Mr Hughes) and received his com-,",31
NA,mission to get on with the task - I t wa3,31
NA,then that he was told what the Govern-,31
NA,ment knew and desired. I left France,31
NA,"on the 24th November, 191S, and was i n",31
NA,London one week ahead of General Mon-,31
NA,ash. I was intimately associated then,31
NA,"with the demobilization work, and I",31
NA,knew the moves .that were being made.,31
NA,After hearing that statement the honor-,31
NA,able member will know that I have sought,31
NA,to give him informatiou and prevent any,31
NA,misunderstanding regarding the officer,31
NA,who is responsible for the demobilization,31
NA,of the Australian troops.,31
Mr HIGGS ,Woul d you mind saying,31
NA,"whether, in your opinion,",31
NA,Monash is competent to carry out the,31
NA,demobilization ?,31
Mr BURCHELL ,Absolutely . Any-,31
NA,body who knows that gentleman will agree,31
NA,that Australia could not have had a,31
NA,better organizer or a more competent,31
NA,"man, from both a military and a civil",31
NA,point of view- a man with broader,31
NA,knowledge of what the Australians,31
NA,"require, or better equipped with the",31
NA,driving force necessary to carry on his,31
NA,organization well and promptly.,31
Mr HIGGS , A r e you not exaggerat-,31
NA,ing now ?,31
Mr BURCHELL , N o t one bit. I,31
NA,saw General Monash arrive i n London on,31
NA,the 1st of December with a few senior,31
NA,officers i n order to create and conduct the,31
NA,"demobilization scheme, and I have seen",31
NA,"his Department grow, and the work done,",31
NA,at close hand. I say absolutely that Aus-,31
NA,tralia could not have had a better man,31
NA,than General Monash for the job.,31
Mr HIGGS ,It is not too big for him 1,31
Mr BURCHELL ,Certainl y not.,31
Mr HIGGS ,The n why is Senator,31
NA,Pearce required. there ?,31
Mr BURCHELL ,Honorabl e memother,31
NA,"bers may smile, but the honorable member",31
NA,"for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs), who is",31
NA,"ex-Minister, is aware of the fact that",31
NA,Ministers have a different standing,31
NA,status altogether from a public servant,31
NA,or a general of the A r m y.,31
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Hughes) and the,31
NA,Minister for the Navy ( Sir Joseph Cook),31
NA,were in London: but could both or.,31
NA,"either be expected to be i n two places,",31
NA,at once ? How could the Prime Minister,31
NA,be in Paris and Loudon at the same,31
NA,time? I can only tell the honorable,31
NA,member for Capricornia that my state-,31
NA,"ment is quite correct, as to General",31
NA,Monash being able to carry out tbe,31
NA,work.,31
Mr YATES ,D o you not think that,31
NA,the credit belongs to. him for the de-,31
NA,mobilization of the troops ?,31
Mr BURCHELL , N o t tlie whole of,31
NA,the credit,31
Mr YATES ,Ho w much of i t belongs,31
NA,to Senator Pearce?,31
Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. W . Elliot,31
NA,Johnson) -Order ! There have been,31
NA,General numerous interjections within a few,31
NA,minutes.,31
Mr YATES , A n d this is my ouly on<,31
NA,in the last half-a-dozen.,31
NA,Mr .SPEAKER -Th e honorable mem-,31
NA,ber is out of order.,31
Mr BURCHELL,Th e honorable,31
NA,member for Capricornia knows that,31
NA,there are many instances in which,31
NA,i t is necessary to go a step higher,31
NA,and get to a responsible Minister of the,31
NA,Crown over the head of a chief of a De-',31
NA,partment. General Monash had riot that,31
NA,"advantage, and neither the Prime M i n -",31
NA,ister nor the Minister for the Navy,31
NA,were or could be always available in Lon-,31
NA,don. When I l e f t England on the 17th,31
NA,"of March, i t was expected by the Depart-",31
NA,ment that the whole of the Australian,31
NA,troops would be out of England by the,31
NA,end of September. Senator Pearce arrived,31
NA,"in London two days after I left , so that I",31
NA,did not see him. I arrived in Australia,31
NA,"six weeks later, and I am informed",31
NA,"through the cables, that the whole of the",31
NA,Australian troops are expected to be out,31
NA,"of the Old Country by the end of July,",31
NA,showing a clear saving of two months.,31
NA,I do not know anything' more thando,31
NA,"honorable members, because, when",31
NA,"I left the Department, I , of course, handed",31
NA,"an the whole of the business over. However,",31
NA,if we can infer anything from the facts,31
NA,"and at all, with the knowledge I have of",31
NA,times when even General Monash needed,31
NA,"Both the. the extra bit of push I have indicated,",31
NA,I believe that Senator Pearce has been,31
NA,responsible in a very large degree f o r the,31
NA,speeding up. That is my firm conviction,32
NA,after hearing all the arguments and dis-,32
NA,"cussions, and having read the informa-",32
NA,tion afforded by the press.,32
Mr WATKINS ,I s that admission not,32
NA,rather disrespectful towards the British,32
NA,Government ?,32
Mr BURCHELL , I did not see any-,32
NA,thing in it disrespectful to the British,32
NA,Government. The honorable member,32
NA,knows as well as I do that the gentlemen,32
NA,who compose the British Government are,32
NA,"human just as he and I , and are liable to",32
NA,make the same sort of mistakes. After,32
NA,"all, i t is time after time necessary to get",32
NA,"to the right man in order to ""make",32
NA,"good.""",32
NA,The honorable member for Capri-,32
NA,cornia referred to a speech made by,32
NA,"Major Henley, who is member for Bur-",32
NA,wood in the New South Wale3 Parlia-,32
NA,ment. No date was quoted as to when,32
NA,the ships in question were offered and re-,32
NA,"fused, and I remind the honorable mem-",32
NA,ber that to offer a ship to the Australian,32
NA,"authorities to-day, and say that it must",32
NA,be loaded on Sunday is not practicable.,32
NA,On this side of the world we desire every,32
NA,man to return with a f u ll statement of his,32
NA,affairs as they have developed oversea. I n,32
NA,"giving this information, I am not using",32
NA,"technical terms, but stating the facts as",32
NA,briefly as possible in a fashion tbat hon-,32
NA,orable members can accept and appreciate.,32
NA,We desire to have with each man a photo-,32
NA,graph of his pay ledger card in order that,32
NA,"when he arrives here it may not be, as i t",32
NA,"was originally, a matter of weeks and",32
NA,months before he can be finalized. Pro-,32
NA,"fiting; from mistakes in the past, the De-",32
NA,partment on the other side decided that,32
NA,after selecting a man for a quota or,32
NA,"draft, they would get all the particulars",32
NA,"and papers necessary, and send them on",32
NA,"the ship on which the man travelled, so",32
NA,that he and they might arrive simultane-,32
NA,"ously. I n about 1 per cent, of the cases",32
NA,"the plan fails even to-day, as the most",32
NA,carefully arranged mechanism and ad-,32
NA,ministration must fail. When this hon-,32
NA,orable member of the State Parliament of,32
NA,New South Wales makes the assertion he,32
NA,"does, i t would be as well to find out the",32
NA,date on which the ships were offered and,32
NA,"rejected, and the period that was allowed",32
NA,in which they were to be filled with men.,32
NA,"I do not know the circumstances at all,",32
NA,- but,32
Mr HECTOR LAMOND ,Th e wholo,32
NA,thing has since been denied in London.,32
Mr BURCHELL , I am merely sug-,32
NA,gesting that there may have been a reason,32
NA,"why the offer was rejected, if i t was",32
NA,rejected at all. Now I am advised,32
NA,there has been an official denial. Honor-,32
NA,able members may not be aware that,32
NA,originally it was proposed by the Imperial,32
NA,Government that all oversea troops,32
NA,should be returned to their home countries,32
NA,"direct from Prance, and, acting on that",32
NA,"assumption, thc Canadian, the South",32
NA,"African, the New Zealand, and thtUnited",32
NA,States Governments got to work and made,32
NA,their plans for demobilization. How-,32
NA,"ever, there was a change in the pro-",32
NA,"gramme, and the change was notified only",32
NA,after the armistice had been signed. 1,32
NA,ask honorable members generally to bear,32
NA,in mind what this one change alone,32
NA,would mean in the way of organization.,32
NA,Large bodies of men cannot be moved un-,32
NA,less careful arrangements are made for,32
NA,"the movement, and for proper feeding,",32
NA,"housing, and so forth. By way of illustra-",32
NA,"tion, I may say that in the Old Country",32
NA,it was not possible to get the necessary,32
NA,camp accommodation for our Australian,32
NA,soldiers without much delay and much,32
NA,cross-firing between the Home authorities,32
NA,and the representatives of Australia.,32
NA,"Ultimately, the difficulties were overcome,",32
NA,and we were able to get additional camps.,32
NA,I do not think that honorable members,32
NA,opposite would desire Australian soldiers,32
NA,to be quartered in tents on Salisbury,32
NA,-plain in winter time.,32
Mr FLEMING ,No t i f honorable mem-,32
NA,hers had been there themselves!,32
Mr BURCHELL , I agree with the,32
NA,"honoraible member, and on this question",32
NA,the honorable member for Adelaide ( Mr.,32
NA,Yates) and myself will be in accord.,32
Mr YATES ,No t when there are six-,32
NA,"teen i n a tent, though the honorable mem-",32
NA,ber has not had that experience.,32
Mr BURCHELL ,Hav e I not?,32
Mr YATES , I am only judging from,32
NA,what I saw of oflicers generally.,32
Mr BURCHELL ,Th e honorable mem-,32
NA,ber has no right to judge unless he knows.,32
NA,H e asked me a little while ago to prove,33
NA,"something, and I ' do not wish to retaliate",33
NA,"by asking him to prove his statement, be-",33
NA,cause he does not know the facts.,33
Mr YATES , I say I do not t h i n k you,33
NA,have had to occupy such a tent.,33
Mr BURCHELL , N o body of men i n,33
NA,the position of General Monash and his,33
NA,senior officers would dream of bringing,33
NA,our soldiers over from France until they,33
NA,had made complete arrangements for their,33
NA,"housing, feeding, and general welfare.",33
NA,This was one of the tasks which imme-,33
NA,diately confronted the demobilization staff,33
NA,"in London, and I may say that that phase",33
NA,"of the work did not affect me, so that",33
NA,honorable members need not 'think I am,33
NA,"""sounding any praise of myself. I know,",33
NA,"however, that there was that real diffi-",33
NA,"culty, and i t was only after satisfactory",33
NA,arrangements had been made that the,33
NA,"flow of men f r o m France to England, and",33
NA,"firom England to the ships, was provided",33
NA,for.,33
NA,"The honorable member f o r Adelaide,",33
NA,"in an interjection, said that he did not",33
NA,get that leave which was enjoyed by his,33
NA,"comrades, and I can quite believe that he",33
NA,"very naturally felt aggrieved, no doubt",33
NA,"thinking that, having been brought from",33
NA,"France, i t was intended to rush h im",33
NA,straight to the steamer.,33
Mr YATES ,M y case was,33
NA,worst; men who had been twelve months,33
NA,in tihe field were deprived of tlieir leave.,33
Mr BURCHELL , I cannot under-,33
NA,stand how that came about.,33
NA,MT . YATES -Th e Prime,33
NA,"ought to know,",33
Mr BURCHELL , W h y should tha,33
NA,Prime Minister know?,33
Mr YATES ,"Becaus e I wired to him,",33
NA,and paid f o r a reply.,33
Mr BURCHELL ,D o,33
NA,where the Prime Minister was at rhe,33
NA,time?,33
Mr YATES , I do not; but a reply was,33
NA,paid for.,33
Mr BURCHELL ," I have here, i f",33
NA,honorable members care to look at them,33
NA,"privately, the instructions issued to all",33
NA,concerned i n the demobilization and re-,33
NA,patriation of the Australian soldiers.,33
NA,These instructions were issued i n order,33
NA,that every section of the Australian,33
NA,"Imperial Force, whether i n France,",33
NA,"on Salisbury Plain, or i n London,",33
NA,"should know how, where, and why cer-",33
NA,tain things were to happen. I t is,33
NA,laid down clearly and definitely that sol-,33
NA,diers are to be allowed their furlough .,33
Mr YATES ,Wa s not that after the,33
NA,troops had refused to go on board a vessel,33
NA,"at Devonport, and General'Monash, who",33
NA,"was called down tliere, had approved of",33
NA,their request? The men had leave after-,33
NA,wards.,33
NA,Mr BURCHELL ' - W h a t was the,33
NA,date of that?,33
Mr YATES ," I do not know, but I",33
NA,read about i t i n an Adelaide paper on,33
NA,my arrival at Fremamtle.,33
NA,"Mr BURCHELL , - I do not say t h at",33
NA,the honorable member's statement is i n -,33
NA,"correct, but I would like to know the date",33
NA,in order that we might clear up any mis-,33
NA,understanding. The Director-General of,33
NA,"Demobilization, with whom I was asso-",33
NA,"ciated for nearly four months, ie as sym-",33
NA,"pathetic towards the "" digger "" as is any",33
NA,honorable member opposite.,33
Mr YATES , I believe i t .,33
Mr BURCHELL , I n the general,33
NA,demobilization instructions provision was,33
NA,made for every oflicer or man to have,33
NA,fourteen days' leave i n Great Britain be-,33
NA,fore embarking f or Australia. I f tbere,33
NA,not the,33
NA,was any case i n which that leave was not,33
NA,"granted, i t was not done at the instiga-",33
NA,"tion, or with the knowledge, of the ad-",33
NA,ministration i n London.,33
Mr YATES , I paraded before my,33
NA,"Minister colonel, and urged public business i n my",33
NA,"capacity as member of Parliament, but I",33
NA,was not granted leave.,33
Mr HECTOR LAMOND , I am pleased,33
NA,that politicians did not get a puil over,33
NA,there.,33
Mr BURCHELL , I n the Australian,33
NA,"I n p e r i a l Force, i t was very often a dis-",33
NA,tinct disadvantage to be a. member of,33
NA,Parliament.,33
Mr FLEMING ,I t was decidedly. I,33
NA,had proof of i t on many an occasion.,33
Mr BURCHELL ,Th e honorable,33
NA,member for Adelaide is not alone. I,33
NA,think he will find that all the members,33
NA,of Parliament who were i n the Austra-,33
NA,lian Imperial Force suffered f r o m the,33
NA,same disadvantage.,33
Mr YATES , I got as little out of the,34
NA,fact that I was a member of Parliament,34
NA,as any man got.,34
Mr FLEMING , I also had no leave,34
NA,fore embarking from the Old Country.,34
Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. W . Elliot it,34

Mr BURCHELL ,Th e,34
NA,member for Kennedy ( Mr MCDonald),34

NA,"Minister ( Mr W a t t ) would reply, and",34
NA,"the Acting Prime Minister was good selected,",34
NA,enough to refer to myself i n connexion,34
NA,wth demobilizaton matters.,34
Mr BLAKELEY ,H e called upon you to,34
NA,give your testimony.,34
Mr BURCHELL , I t is more tha.n,34
NA,testimony; i t is proof. The honorable,34
NA,member for Kennedy asked in a rather,34
NA,sneering way i f I knew anything about,34
NA,the French end of demobilization ? The,34
NA,"Imperia l Head-quarters, which controlled",34
NA,"the Australian Imperial Force, were",34
NA,"London, and an organization which is",34
NA,controlled by another must of necessity,34
NA,have its central administration at the commodated.,34
NA,point where the other is operating. That,34
NA,was the reason for the establishment,34
NA,our central administration f o r demobilizatained.,34
NA,tion i n London. Any person who was,34
NA,aware of the great trouble occasioned by,34
NA,"the delays to mails, and the unsatisfac-",34
NA,tory method of making use of telegrams,34
NA,"between France and England, can realize",34
NA,how difficult i t was to carry on dealings,34
NA,"between the two places, and how necessonal",34
NA,sary i t was to have the demobilization,34
NA,head-quarters i n London.,34
Mr YATES ,Th e honorable member,34

NA,disgrace to the Commonwealth.,34
Mr BURCHELL , W h a t part of it?,34
Mr YATES ,Ever y part of i t .,34
Mr BURCHELL , I cannot admit,34
NA,that. The administration at Horseferryferry-road,34
NA,road was as good as could be found,34
NA,where.,34
Mr YATES , I shall give an illustraevenly,34
NA,tion of i t when I speak.,34
Mr BURCHELL , T h e n I am sorry,34
NA,the honorable member did not precede,34
NA,I agree w i th h i m i f he is referring,34
NA,approach to Horseferry-road.,34
Mr FLEMING ,"Hear , heart",34
Mr BURCHELL , T h e environment,34
NA,"of Horseferry-road is very bad, but i t",34
NA,must be remembered that at the time the,34
NA,bebuilding was taken over by the adminis-,34
NA,tration of the Australian Imperial Force,34
NA,was practically impossible to get other,34
NA,premises of a suitable size i n which to,34
NA,house a large staff.,34
Mr HECTOR LAMOND ,Ther e should,34
NA,by have been a Commonwealth Minister i n,34
NA,Acting Prime London all the time.,34
Mr BURCHELL , W h e n this site was,34
NA,the H i g h Commissioner's office,34
NA,"was i n Victoria-street, Westminster, and",34
NA,the premises chosen in Horseferry-road,34
NA,were considered to be sufficient to house the,34
NA,comparatively small staff attached to the .,34
NA,Australian Imperial 'Force administra-,34
NA,"tion at that time. However, the necessity",34
NA,for larger premises grew very rapidly.,34
NA,The whole of the records of a constantly,34
NA,growing establishment of men and oflicers,34
NA,had to be kept there; the war relics were,34
NA,"i n stored there, and all the activities",34
NA,branching out f r o m the Australian I m -,34
NA,perial Force administration had to be ac-,34
NA,"But, notwithstanding all",34
NA,"these difficulties, the administrative staff",34
NA,of was as efficient a body as could be ob-,34
NA,"Of course, individual cases may",34
NA,be quoted which would appear to disprove,34
NA,"my argument, b u t , I am speaking on broad",34
NA,"lines. I , myself, have had a personal",34
NA,experience which might go to disprove,34
NA,my statement. I t was not so much per- -,34
NA,experience as inter-departmental ex-,34
NA,perience of the Horseferry-road admini-,34
NA,stration.,34
Mr YATES ,Horseferry-roa d was,34
NA,"known as the "" flappers' rest,"" was i t not ?",34
Mr BURCHELL ," I t may have been,",34
NA,but I have never heard that title used in,34
NA,connexion w i t h i t . The individuals who,34
NA,were responsible f o r the work at Horse-,34
NA,"were, on the whole, hard-work-",34
NA,"anying, conscientious men who used every",34
NA,endeavour to hold the scales of justice,34
NA,i n accordance w i th the instructions,34
NA,they received f r o m time to time. B u t the,34
NA,work at Horseferry-road could have been,34
NA,me. speeded up. I was asked to take up a,34
NA,"to the certain branch of demobilization, and",34
NA,"entered on the duties attaching to i t on ,",34
NA,the 9th December last. I was given an,34
NA,"office, a table, and a telephone; writing",35
NA,material eventually came along; and 1,35
NA,"was bold, ""The Australian Imperial Force",35
NA,is there; select the staff you need to carry,35
NA,"on this work, and go ahead."" Not know-",35
NA,ing the Australian Imperial Force very,35
NA,"intimately, I sought the advice of officers",35
NA,"who did, and secured the names of a num-",35
NA,ber of men who were considered suitable,35
NA,for the class of work I had on hand.,35
NA,Then I applied through the departmental,35
NA,channel of Horseferry-road to have these,35
NA,men sent across from France to London,35
NA,for the purpose of an interview; because,35
NA,the work I was doing was performed,35
NA,wholly by men who volunteered to remain,35
NA,in Great Britain and see it through. I,35
NA,"emphasize my use of the word "" volun-",35
NA,"teered;"" i t has a bearing on something",35
NA,which I wish to say later on. I t took me,35
NA,exactly six weeks to get one senior officer,35
NA,from France to London through the,35
NA,Horseferry-road administration. I t took,35
NA,me ten days to get another officer through,35
NA,-the Demobilization Administration.,35
NA,was not excessive for an officer to,35
NA,spend ten days in reaching London,35
NA,owing to the transportation delays that,35
NA,"ensued upon the signing of the armistice,",35
NA,but a delay of six weeks was outrageous.,35
NA,That is my experience from an inter-,35
NA,departmental point of view.,35
NA,"Now, in reference to the voluntary",35
NA,work of members of the Australian Im-,35
NA,"perial Force in London, Senator Pearce",35
NA,has been accused of having taken twenty-,35
NA,seven pay clerks from Australia to the,35
NA,-Old Country. I t was in January last,35
NA,that Senator Pearce left for London with,35
NA,"these officers, but at that time one had",35
NA,greatest difficulty in the world to get,35
NA,members of the Australian Imperial Force,35
NA,to volunteer their services for any work,35
NA,in London. When news came to Aus-,35
NA,tralia from Great Britain that clerks,35
NA,were scarce and worth their weight in,35
NA,"gold, and that the necessary work had to",35
NA,be done by employing English people in,35
NA,"the Australian offices, the Defence De-",35
NA,partment decided to send these twenty-,35
NA,seven pay clerks from Australia to Lon-,35
NA,"don, where they were required. There",35
NA,was no desire on the part of the Admini-,35
NA,stration to force a member of the Austra-,35
NA,lian Imperial Force to leave France,35
NA,"against his will and go to London, and",35
NA,thus be blocked from returning to Aus-,35
NA,tralia.,35
Mr FLEMING ,Thos e clerks were only,35
NA,despatched after the chance of doing the,35
NA,work had been offered to practically,35
NA,"every man serving over, there.",35
Mr BURCHELL ,I t was promul-,35
NA,"gated time after time, through General",35
NA,"Orders, that this work was available. I",35
NA,have seen official letters from the Acting,35
NA,"Corps Commander, General Hobbs, and",35
NA,"from other senior officers in France, show-",35
NA,ing that they did their utmost to meet the,35
NA,request of the Director-General of De-,35
NA,mobilization that he should be supplied,35
NA,with the necessary clerical assistance.,35
Mr TUDOR ,Th e complaint here waa,35
NA,that returned soldiers did not have tho,35
NA,"opportunity of getting those positions,",35
NA,and that men who had not seen a day's,35
NA,active service were chosen in preference,35
NA,to them.,35
Mr BURCHELL ,I t is evidently a,35
NA,"double-barrelled complaint, but I believe",35
NA,I am right in saying that quite a number,35
NA,of the.men who went away from here-,35
NA,"in fact, about half of them-hav e seen",35
NA,overseas service.,35
NA,Silting suspended from 1 till 2.15 p.m.,35
Mr BURCHELL ,Whil e I commend,35
NA,the promptitude with which the Govern-,35
NA,ment dealt with the. work of demobiliza-,35
NA,tion in London after the armistice had,35
NA,"been signed, I do not think that the com-",35
NA,plexities of the undertaking were realized,35
NA,"by Ministers here, nor did the Govern-",35
NA,"the ment in Australia, in my judgment, make",35
NA,the preparatory arrangements which,35
NA,ought to have been made before the,35
NA,armistice. The matter was brought,35
NA,under the notice of the Govermnent in,35
NA,"July and August of last year, but while",35
NA,the demobilization schemes of other coun-,35
NA,"tries, including some of the Dominions",35
NA,"of the Empire, had been outlined and",35
NA,agreed upon by their respective Adminis-,35
NA,"trations, we in Australia were undecided.",35
NA,Various propositions were put to the Go-,35
NA,"vernment, but were neither rejected nor",35
NA,accepted. Some little time might have,35
NA,been saved in organizing the Demobiliza-,35
NA,tion Department in London had .proper,35
NA,attention been given to tbe original sug-,36
NA,gestion put forward from the Imperial,36
NA,end.,36
NA,I am glad that the Leader of the Go-,36
NA,vernment requested me to deal with the,36
NA,demobilization proposition. Before I,36
NA,"left the Old Country, General Monash",36
NA,"also asked me, not only to advise members",36
NA,of the Cabinet here as to what was tak-,36
NA,"ing place, but also to make it as widely",36
NA,"known as possible, since he recognised",36
NA,"tliat the work he was undertaking, which",36
NA,"was not perfect in his eyes, needed some",36
NA,"explanation, in order that .the people, and",36
NA,particularly the members of this Parlia-,36
NA,"ment, might appreciate some of the diffi-",36
NA,culties associated with it .,36
NA,Turning to the repatriation proposals,36
NA,"in the Ministerial statement, I say quite",36
NA,frankly that my brief experience in my,36
NA,constituency taught me that the work of,36
NA,repatriation bristled with difficulties.,36
NA,The Department entered upon i t without,36
NA,any precedents for its guidariee. Prece-,36
NA,dents had to be created from day to day,36
NA,"and week to week, and at the outset the",36
NA,machinery governing . the repatriation,36
NA,effort was necessarily imperfect. There,36
NA,have been individual cases where the re-,36
NA,gulations framed under the Act have,36
NA,"pressed harshly, and, in the view of some",36
NA,"honorable members, rather unjustly, but",36
NA,my experience of the Department is that,36
NA,it is not only sympathetic in its treatment,36
NA,"of the returned soldier, but does its ut-",36
NA,most to meet the varying and conflicting,36
NA,requests that are put forward. We all,36
NA,know that what suits one individual may,36
NA,"not suit another, and that a regulation",36
NA,"framed to-day to meet, perhaps, quite a",36
NA,number of cases of a particular kind may,36
NA,be apt to press heavily on other indivi-,36
NA,dual cases. Taking the work of the De-,36
NA,"partment all through, however, when we",36
NA,"find that, after allowing for the men who",36
NA,have returned to their former avocations,36
NA,"without assistance, only 4 per cent, of",36
NA,those who have been dealt with by the,36
NA,Department have not 'been satisfactorily,36
NA,"placed, we must agree that its perform-",36
NA,ance is most creditable.,36
NA,I was surprised that the honorable,36
NA,member for Brisbane ( Mr Finlayson),36
NA,should have attempted to throw on the,36
NA,Mr Burchell.,36
NA,1,36
NA,Government the whole responsibility for,36
NA,the industrial unrest prevalent through-,36
NA,"out Australia to-day, on the ground that",36
NA,they had not made i t easier for various,36
NA,unions to approach the Conciliation and,36
NA,Arbitration Court. Every honorable,36
NA,member of this House is familiar with,36
NA,the constitutional and either difficulties,36
NA,"that have been in the way, so that the",36
NA,"honorable member, in seeking to lay the",36
NA,whole of the blame at the door of the Go-,36
NA,"vernment, was most unjust. He knew",36
NA,perfectly well that his statement was in-,36
NA,correct. The effect of the return to civil,36
NA,employment of the men who have been,36
NA,fighting is not being felt in Australia,36
NA,only. The matter is one that affects the,36
NA,"whole world, and industrial unrest to-day",36
NA,is world-wide. I n to-day's newspapers,36
NA,there appears a cablegram reporting a,36
NA,speech made by the Prime Minister ( Mr.,36
NA,"Hughes), in which he clearly indicates",36
NA,that industrial unrest in the Old Country,36
NA,"is a very pressing question, and reminds",36
NA,both Capital and Labour that in order to,36
NA,"satisfactorily settle i t, the greatest care",36
NA,must be exercised in the re-absorp-,36
NA,tion of our tens of thousands of sol-,36
NA,diers into civil employment. I believe,36
NA,that in this process a good deal of friction,36
NA,"is inevitable, since it means the displac-",36
NA,ing of a great number of women workers,36
NA,and of others who necessarily filled the,36
NA,gap during the absence of our men at the,36
NA,"front. That friction, however, is not",36
NA,going to be removed by the mak-,36
NA,ing of inflammatory speeches. Every,36
NA,honorable member should realize the,36
NA,"responsibilities resting upon him, and",36
NA,if we are to assist in bringing about a,36
NA,better understanding between employer,36
NA,"and employee, we should get to grips",36
NA,with the problem before the nation.,36
Mr YATES ,Wil l the honorable mem-,36
NA,ber be surprised to learn that 323 out of,36
NA,the 400 men on the Repatriation Depart-,36
NA,ment unemployed list for South Australia,36
NA,are labourers?,36
Mr BURCHELL , I should be sur-,36
NA,prised. I n the State of which I am a,36
NA,representative a number of those appear-,36
NA,ing on the Repatriation Department's,36
NA,unemployed list are artisans. Others are,36
NA,"clerks, but the percentage of general",36
NA,labour is very small. I n order to deal most,36
NA,effectively with the prevailing industrial,37
NA,unrest wemust endeavour to get nearer,37
NA,bedrock. There are strikes i n various,37
NA,"parts of the Commonwealth to-day,",37
NA,while others are threatening. Honorable,37
NA,members opposite aro now pledging them-,37
NA,selves to favour arbitration as against,37
NA,direct action. Many of them throughout,37
NA,their political career have been in favour,37
NA,"of arbitration, and whether i t be by a",37
NA,reference to the Court or by round table,37
NA,"conferences, we must have some form of",37
NA,arbitration i f we are to bring about a,37
NA,clearer and better understanding between,37
NA,employer and employed. What I desire,37
NA,above everything else-an d I say this to,37
NA,employers as well as employees-i s that,37
NA,there should be a more humane feeling,37
NA,displayed between the two parties.,37
Mr YATES ,Woul d i t not be right to,37
NA,say that there should be more equitable,37
NA,results ?,37
Mr BURCHELL , I f the honorable,37
NA,member will permit me to elaborate my,37
NA,"argument, he will learn exactly where I",37
NA,stand with regard to the industrial pro-,37
NA,"blem. While ""in the Old Country I .had",37
NA,an opportunity to deal directly with the,37
NA,National Alliance of Employers and E m -,37
NA,ployed. I was surprised to discover that,37
NA,in that organization there were many,37
NA,men so well known i n the manufactur-,37
NA,"ing world, as well as amongst the indus-",37
NA,"trial classes, that the Federation of",37
NA,"Trade Unions, with its general secretary,",37
NA,"Mr Appleton, representing",37
NA,"2,000,000 workers, was directly affiliated",37
NA,with the Alliance. I found that on the,37
NA,executive of that body organized Labour,37
NA,"had equal representation ""with the em-",37
NA,"ployers, that they met on terms of abso-",37
NA,"lute equality, that the principle of one",37
NA,"man one vote was applied, and that i n",37
NA,every way the object of the organization,37
NA,was to create a better understanding be-,37
NA,"tween employer and employed. I found,",37
NA,"also, that the work of this organization",37
NA,was most effective. We are discussing i n,37
NA,Australia to-day the report of the,37
NA,Whitley Commission. That Commission,37
NA,was the outcome of an organized effort,37
NA,on behalf of the National Alliance of,37
NA,Employers and Employed to secure the,37
NA,appointment of a Select Committee of,37
NA,the House of Commons to deal with the,37
NA,subject. That Committee was converted,37
NA,"into the Whitley Commission, whose re-",37
NA,port was influenced and swayed by the,37
NA,experience of its members of the working,37
NA,of this very organization. I invite hon-,37
NA,"orable members to get together, and to",37
NA,have a heart-to-heart talk as to the best,37
NA,way of meeting the present situation. I t,37
NA,is useless for one side to .be abusing the,37
NA,other. There should be no tearing down.,37
NA,"There should be no saying this, that, and",37
NA,"the other , of the capitalists, and there",37
NA,should be no condemnation of the worker,37
NA,by the employing class.,37
Mr HIGGS ,Th e honorable member,37
NA,will have to talk i n that way to his,37
NA,"abusive Prime Minister, and induce him",37
NA,to alter his tone.,37
Mr BURCHELL , I know that the,37
NA,Prime Minister is intensely favorable to,37
NA,the objects of the organization to which,37
NA,"I have just referred, and I commend that",37
NA,organization to my honorable friend.,37
NA,Mr Tunou -D o you think we could,37
NA,meet the Victorian Employers' Federa-,37
NA,"tion, who employ a man to go about and",37
NA,say that marriage is a luxury f o r the,37
NA,workers ?,37
Mr BURCHELL , I can tell the,37
NA,Leader of the Opposition tliat there are,37
NA,men actively associated with this par-,37
NA,ticular organization i n the Old Country,37
NA,"who felt infinitely more bitter, i f i t were",37
NA,"possible, than one would feel at a state-",37
NA,ment of that kind. One of the principal,37
NA,some officers on tlie Labour side of this organi-,37
NA,"zation is a man named H a r r y Duberry,",37
NA,"who, f o r several years, was the secretary",37
NA,of the Independent Labour party i n the,37
NA,"United Kingdom i n pre-war days, and he",37
NA,is not a man who by any stretch of imagi-,37
NA,nation could be charged with truckling to,37
NA,employers or to capital. Other men who,37
NA,have given the whole of their lives to the,37
NA,cause of organized labour i n the Old,37
NA,"Country-me n like Ben Tillet, Appleton,",37
NA,and others who could be quoted-ar e mem-,37
NA,"bers of this organization, and are meeting,",37
NA,for the sake of the workers whom they,37
NA,"represent, the direct opponents of all the",37
NA,Conservative ideas of the Motherland.,37
NA,They are meeting those men fairly arid,37
NA,"squarely, face to face. They are putting",37
NA,"the workers' case, and the others are put-",37
NA,ting the employers' case; but eventually,37
NA,"they will understand one another, and re-",38
NA,move doubt and distrust on either side.,38
NA,That is the phase of this movement which,38
NA,I commend to honorable members op-,38
NA,"posite, and wibh equal earnestness to hon-",38
NA,orable members on bhis side.,38
Mr TUDOR , I went down to the,38
NA,"Chamber of Manufactures, and pointed",38
NA,"out how they made Â£6,000,000 more profit",38
NA,within the last four years than they had',38
NA,"made previously, according to their own",38
NA,figures. They did not feel very much,38
NA,obliged to me for telling them that.,38
Mr BURCHELL , I should be only,38
NA,too glad to have the assistance' of the,38
NA,"Leader of the Opposition i n this matter,",38
NA,because I feel that i t is one of the ways,38
NA,in which we can solve the problems that,38
NA,are confronting us - I say to him i n all,38
NA,sincerity that i f we can get organized,38
NA,labour on the one hand and capital on the,38
NA,"other, to meet together fo r some common",38
NA,"object, as they are meeting i n the particu-",38
NA,"lar instance I have quoted, we shall re-",38
NA,move quite a number of the existing dif-,38
NA,ficulties and disadvantages.,38
NA,"The objects of the alliance, briefly",38
NA,"stated, are as follow:-",38
NA,1. To promote active co-operation of em-,38
NA,ployers and employed in the treatment of ques-,38
NA,tions generally affecting labour and employment,38
NA,in all trades and industrial occupations.,38
NA,2. To promote the welfare of the industrial,38
NA,"workers of the country, and efficiency of its",38
NA,industries.,38
NA,3. To promote arrangements for facilitating,38
NA,the reinstatement in civil employment at the,38
NA,"end of the war of men serving with the Forces,",38
NA,and also munition workers.,38
NA,This organization was only formed in,38
NA,1916. I t was bred out of war-time condi-,38
NA,"tions, and with a knowledge of what the",38
NA,war might eventually mean. I n the re-,38
NA,"port for 1916-18, the following excerpt",38
NA,"is quoted from one of the ""Whitley re-",38
NA,ports-,38
NA,Tho causes of industrial unrest are clearly,38
NA,associated not only with the industries and the,38
NA,"technicalities relating thereto, but with thc",38
NA,"wider social, domestic, or national questions.",38
NA,affecting the homes and domestic concerns of,38
NA,the people.,38
NA,I am sure honorable members opposite,38
NA,have all questions affecting the homes and,38
NA,domestic concerns of people at heart.,38
NA,Those are among the things with which,38
NA,this organization deals-,38
NA,We arc convinced that these causes are not,38
NA,"local or peculiar to any particular industry,",38
NA,"but are of a national character, and a remedial",38
NA,policy must be adopted by the Government,38
NA,"quickly and vigorously, if the incipient and",38
NA,growing dangers now threatening the indus-,38
NA,tries are to be averted.,38
NA,What is wanted is a new spirit- a more,38
NA,"humane spirit, one in which economic and busi-",38
NA,ness considerations will be influenced and cor-,38
NA,"rected, and, it is hoped, will be eventually con-",38
NA,"trolled, by human and ethical consideration.",38
NA,The main cause of unrest lies deeper than any,38
NA,"mere material consideration. The problem, is",38
NA,"fundamentally a human, and not an economic,",38
NA,problem. A new spirit of partnership is there-,38
NA,fore essential.,38
NA,The gentlemen responsible for the for-,38
NA,mation of this alliance thought so much of,38
NA,those remarks that they put them into,38
NA,their report. Amongst its membership,38
NA,and on its executive committee are repre-,38
NA,sentatives of what were at one time the,38
NA,most Conservative business men of the,38
NA,"Old Land. To-day, realizing their re-",38
NA,"sponsibilities, they are helping i n this",38
NA,work.,38
Mr YATES ,T o use a phrase which the,38
NA,"honorable member w i l l understand, they",38
NA,"have "" got the wind up."" Is not that the",38
NA,reason ?,38
Mr BURCHELL , I do not agree,38
NA,with that at all. I t is not a question of,38
NA,""" getting the wind up "" in their case. I",38
NA,remind the honorable member that the,38
NA,Government of the United Kingdom,38
NA,offered a shipyard as a going concern tb,38
NA,different federations of the steel and iron,38
NA,"trade, with permission to step into it, and",38
NA,"pay for it on the very lengthiest of terms,",38
NA,or to run it for a given number of years to,38
NA,see what sort of a fist they made of it.,38
NA,There is no question of the British Go-,38
NA,"vernment "" having the wind up "" is there ?",38
NA,".Unfortunately, the workers' organizations,",38
NA,"for some reason or other, turned the. pro-",38
NA,"position down, according to cabled",38
NA,"reports. Again, in West Hartlepool, a",38
NA,private employer offered his employees in,38
NA,a shipbuilding concern equal representa-,38
NA,"tion on -the directorate, and, 'after the",38
NA,payment of their own and other salaries,38
NA,"and working costs, an equal share in"" this",38
NA,"profits. SirRobert Hadfield in- ""the",38
NA,Birmingham district did exactly the-same,38
NA,thing. I t is up t o us on both sides of,39
NA,the House to do our part as responsible,39
NA,public men i n introducing the idea of the,39
NA,"alliance into our general commercial life,",39
NA,"in order'that, on the one hand, the man",39
NA,who doe6 not believe that any good can,39
NA,"come from labour may be converted,",39
NA,"and, on the other, that the man who, as",39
NA,"a representative of organized . labour,",39
NA,thinks no good can come from the em-,39
NA,"ployer may be converted also, and that",39
NA,"we may have a better tone, a more",39
NA,"humane understanding, and a new spirit",39
NA,"in the community, to use the phrase",39
NA,which honorable members,39
NA,cheered just now. Industrial unrest is,39
NA,not confined to Australia. I t - is not the,39
NA,"sin of this Government, nor would i t be",39
NA,the sin of the Opposition i f they were i n,39
NA,power. The simple fact is that the whole,39
NA,"world is feeling the strain, and unrest is",39
NA,showing itself everywhere.,39
Mr YATES , I t is the sin of this Go-,39
NA,"vernment, so f a r es Australia is congoing to get at i t .",39
NA,"cerned, and would be the sin of auy",39
NA,other Goveniment that allowed the things,39
NA,to go on that bave been going on.,39
Mr BURCHELL , I do not agree,39
NA,with that. Causes other than administhe,39
NA,tration are helping to create the than,39
NA,feeling of unrest. I listened,39
NA,a . good deal of pleasure,39
NA,when the honorable member for Gramit,39
NA,pians ( Mr Jowett) was dealing witb,39
NA,trusts and combines f r o m this side,39
NA,"the House. I have said outside, and",39
NA,"peat here, that I have no sympathy with",39
NA,the man who unjustly profiteers i n this,39
NA,any other community. I have never,39
NA,"wavered i n that regard, but the difficulty",39
NA,"is to get dowii to bedrock, and find out",39
NA,who i ! | doing i t .,39
Mr YATES , I f you have no sympathy,39
NA,"- with i t , what is the strength of your",39
NA,"demnation ? Because i t is here, i t is",39
NA,"gible, i t is a fact.",39
Mr BURCHELL , I invite the honof,39
NA,"orable member to bring his cases along,",39
NA,"when he speaks, as I am doing now. I morrow.",39
NA,am quite willing to learn. During the last,39
NA,six weeks I have bad opportunities of,39
NA,ing the balance-sheet of more than one,39
NA,concern which was openly accused i n my,39
NA,own State of becoming rich and f a t at proposals down.,39
NA,the expense of the community. I am not,39
NA,"a chartered accountant, b u t I hope",39
NA,have enough brains and common sense to.,39
NA,understand a balance-sheet when i t is p u t,39
NA,"in front of me, and I say distinctly that,",39
NA,1,39
NA,although those charges were levelled pro-,39
NA,"miscuously against these firms, their bal-",39
NA,"ance-sheets, which were shown to me i n",39
NA,"confidence, showed nothing i n the way",39
NA,of. huge profits accounted for either by,39
NA,"salaries, by provision for futur e expan-",39
NA,"sion, by development, or i n stock.",39
Mr WEST , O r i n reserves?,39
Mr BURCHELL , I went into the 1,39
NA,"matter very closely, because I am sure",39
NA,the honorable member for East Sydney',39
NA,opposite ( Mr West) will take my assurance that,39
NA,I would not deal with the thing i n a half-,39
NA,hearted way. I wanted to know t h e,39
NA,facts. They were good enough to furnish,39
NA,"me with their audited balance-sheets, and",39
NA,I say distinctly that you have to get,39
NA,something more than a surface view to,39
NA,find out where the difficulty is. f,39
NA,do not profess to know how we are,39
NA,The honor-,39
NA,able member i o r Cook ( Mr J . H .,39

NA,"Owing to his work at that time, I believe,",39
NA,honorable member is a wiser man now,39
NA,"he was before he started, and so are'",39
NA,"with a good many more of us, who have found",39
NA,yesterday out that i t is not so easy to fix prices as,39
NA,looks. I f the States w i l l exercise their,39

NA,"with the crippled powers, that i t possesses,",39
NA,to make some effort to assist the States.,39
NA,I n the district which I have the honour,39

NA,"and, from my stand-point, one of",40
NA,most valuable was his admission that,40
NA,demobilization of our troops on. the other,40
NA,side of the world had been in capable,40
NA,hands from its very inception. I n,40
NA,ing that he proved that the presence of,40
NA,Senator Pearce in England was totally,40
NA,unnecessary.,40
Mr BURCHELL , I did not say anyupon,40
NA,thing of the sort.,40
Mr FENTON ,Th e honorable memto,40
NA,ber proved my statement right up to the,40
NA,hilt. We thus have i t from one who has,40
NA,recently returned from the Old Country/,40
NA,and who knows something about the deplacency.,40
NA,"mobilization of our troops there, that the",40
NA,Government and their supporters were,40
NA,guilty of nothing more nor less than,40
NA,wilful waste of public money in sending,40
NA,Senator Pearce and his family overseas. for one thing.,40
Mr BURCHELL , \ did not say any-,40
NA,"thing of the kind, and the honorable",40
NA,member must not put statements into,40
NA,mouth which I did not utter.,40
Mr FENTON,Th e honorable mem-,40
NA,ber prided himself upon being the only,40
NA,member of this Chamber who does not,40
NA,"interject, and I want him 'to live up",40
NA,that reputation. He waxed fairly,40
NA,eloquent in regard to the Whitley report.,40
NA,I invite honorable members to peruse,40
NA,cables that have been published in our,40
NA,daily newspapers during the past few,40
NA,and to say what is going to be the,40
NA,.fate of the Unionist party in the House,40
NA,"to all of Commons? Why, 200 members have",40
NA,"we already waited upon Mr Bonar Law,",40
NA,"their leader, and have stated emphatic-",40
NA,"that, i f the Government are going to",40
NA,"indorse the Whitley report, there will be",40
NA,"it, .is ructions in the political arena.",40
NA,NA,40
NA,ber is mixing up two reports. The,40
NA,Whitley report is altogether different,40
Mr FENTON ,No t altogether dif-,40
NA,"ferent. At any rate, there is to be op-",40
NA,I f iabour is likely to get a,40
NA,bigger bite out of results in the United,40
NA,"Kingdom, pronounced efforts will be",40
NA,made to prevent i t . The honorable,40
NA,member for Fremantle ( Mr Burchell).,40
NA,' is altogether too optimistic when he,40
NA,relies upon those reports to bring,40
NA,the about the conditions which he de-,40
NA,the scribed. I ask the -House to realize,40
NA,that Australia to-day is the one part of,40
NA,"the world which can, i f she chooses, be",40
NA,sayself-contained. Within our own bounds,40
NA,we can produce everything that is neces-,40
NA,sary to sustain human life. Consequently,40
NA,we have very little cause indeed to depend,40
NA,any assistance from the outside,40
NA,world. I f we will only take the trouble,40
NA,"conserve, by means of storage, our",40
NA,"surplus from the good years, we shall al-",40
NA,ways have ample reserves to enable us to,40
NA,face seasons of drought with com-,40
Mr BOYD ,Wha t would the honorable,40
NA,member store during years of plenty to,40
NA,a enable us to meet the lean years?,40
Mr FENTON , I would store wheat,40
Mr BOYD ,Jus t look at the wheat we,40
NA,have stored here now. That ought to,40
NA,my afford the honorable member an object,40
NA,lesson.,40
Mr FENTON ,I t is a well-known,40
NA,fact that the method we have adopted,40
NA,for the storage of wheat in Australia is,40
NA,to an antiquated one. Had the grain been,40
NA,put in silos of sufficient dimensions i t,40
NA,could have been stored without injury.,40
NA,the I f we had had Labour Governments in,40
NA,"power, both State and Federal, we should",40
NA,now have had silos all over the country.,40
NA,NA,41
NA,South Wales.,41
Mr HECTOR LAMOND ,Th e,41
NA,Government of that State has built them.,41
Mr FENTON , W h y do not honor-,41
NA,able members opposite stand up to make,41
NA,their speeches instead of making them,41
NA,sitting down ?,41
Mr TUDOR ,The y would be put out,41
NA,if they were over here.,41
- Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. W . Elliot,41
NA,Johnson) - I must ask the Leader of the,41
NA,"Opposition to withdraw that -statement,",41
NA,which constitutes a reflection on the,41
NA,Chair.,41
Mr TUDOR , I withdraw i t . I have no,41
NA,intention of going out.,41
Mr FENTON , I want to look at Aus-,41
NA,tralia as I find i t to-day. Although its,41
NA,stores are packed w i th foodstuffs f r o m,41
NA,"floor to ceiling, there are empty stomachs",41
NA,in this glorious country of ours. Would,41
NA,the honorable member f o r Fremantle see,41
NA,his dependants starving whilst every shop,41
NA,in Perth and Melbourne is f u l l of the,41
NA,very foodstuffs that are necessary f o r the,41
NA,"maintenance of human life ? We, as legis-",41
NA,"lators, i f we are prepared to Tise to the",41
NA,"occasion, ought not to wait f o r amend-",41
NA,ments to the Constitution or f o r action,41
NA,on tlie part of the State Governments.,41
NA,I f we valued' the lives of human beings,41
NA,we should have prepared f o r this time.,41
NA,But what have we been doing ? Resting,41
NA,On our oars. I do not blame this Govern-,41
NA,ment exclusively f o r that. I blame the,41
NA,"Fisher Government, the",41
NA,"Hughes Governments, and the present",41
NA,"Government, f o r not so organizing our",41
NA,industries that we should be prepared for,41
NA,the demobilization of our troops.,41
Mr BRENNAN ,Th e honorable member,41
NA,for Fremantle supported them all.,41
Mr FENTON , Y e s ; and he con-,41
NA,tinues to do so. Tliese are stern facts,41
NA,that we have to face. I would not shrink,41
NA,from adopting any means-eve n tho,41
NA,"smashing of the Mace, or the tipping",41
NA,of Mr Speaker out of his chair-,41
NA,if that would bring food to the,41
NA,hungry. I would be prepared,41
NA,take my share of the risk incurred i n,41
NA,any such action. I am sure that the hon-,41
NA,orable member for Darwin ( Mr Spence),41
NA,well remembers the dire distress which,41
NA,followed the collapse of the land boom,41
NA,National and the great industrial troubles that oc-,41
NA,curred i n the early nineties. We all know,41
NA,the persecution and the starvation which,41
NA,ensued. We have the iron i n our souls,41
NA,"to this day, as the result of the treatment",41
NA,which was then meted out to innocent,41
NA,people. God forbid that there should be,41
NA,any repetition of those times i n Australia.,41
NA,Yet f o r more than twelve months I have,41
NA,been urging that the same spirit that,41
NA,existed in. the early nineties exists to-day.,41
NA,There is' a tendency on the part of em-,41
NA,"ployers, assisted by capitalistic Govern-",41
NA,"ments, to squelch trade unionism i n this",41
NA,country. No effort is being made to,41
NA,bring about a better understanding be-,41
NA,tween employers and employees. There,41
NA,is no endeavour made to rescue the people,41
NA,f r o m the talons of the profiteer and to,41
NA,provide employment f o r the people. I,41
NA,feel almost the blush of shame rise to my,41
NA,cheeks when I read on the political pro-,41
NA,gramme of the National Federation the,41
NA,"plank, "" Unemployment insurance.""",41
NA,What an awful indictment that is against,41
NA,an intelligent and up-to-date people.,41
NA,Ought there to be any unemployment i n,41
NA,Australia? To that question every voice,41
NA,"i n this House w i l l reply, "" N o ."" I . am",41
NA,not surprised at the present industrial un-,41
NA,"rest i n this country. Knowing, as I do,",41
NA,the spirit of the men and women of the,41
NA,"working classes, the wonder to me is that",41
NA,"there is not still greater unrest. We,",41
NA,"here, talk about this thing and that",41
NA,succeeding thing. Yet we do nothing. Parliament,41
NA,has become merely a talking shop. When,41
NA,we stress the industrial unrest caused by,41
NA,"the excessive cost of living, some honor-",41
NA,"able members whine, "" Why, we have tried",41
NA,"to induce the people on two occasions, to",41
NA,"give this Parliament larger powers, but",41
NA,"they have turned down our proposals.""",41
NA,But i t has always been the policy of the,41
NA,Labour party to t r y and t r y again.,41
NA,When the people were first asked to give,41
NA,this Parliament greater powers under our,41
NA,"Constitution, by an overwhelming ma-",41
NA,jorit y they declined to do so. This may,41
NA,have been due to the fact that the ques-,41
NA,to,41
NA,tions submitted to them were of a some-,41
NA,what intricate character. A t the f o l -,41
NA,"lowing elections the Labour party said,",41
NA,""" We are going to test the opinion of the",42
NA,"people again i n regard to these matters.""",42
NA,We were then assured by our political,42
NA,"opponents, as the honorable member f or",42
NA,"Fremantle knows, that the Labour party",42
NA,was acting in an extremely foolish way,42
NA,by endeavouring to obtain at an election,42
NA,time an amendment of the Constitution.,42
NA,"Nevertheless, the questions were sub-",42
NA,"mitted to the people, and some of those",42
NA,questions were within an ace of being,42
NA,"carried. W i t h that latest vote on record,",42
NA,why have we waited all these years with-,42
NA,out asking the electors once more to,42
NA,endow this National Parliament with the,42
NA,powers which we need ?,42
NA,NA,42
NA,a referendum passed this House.,42
Mr FENTON , Y e s ; and they ought,42
NA,to have been submitted to the people.,42
NA,But we all know ihat i t was represented,42
NA,to the Prime Minister that i f he would,42
NA,"set aside those measures, the State",42
NA,Premiers would take certain action i n,42
NA,the direction of voluntarily handing over,42
NA,to this Parliament more powers than i t,42
NA,at present possesses. We were impressed,42
NA,"by that offer, and we were urged at",42
NA,that particular time to drop the Bills i n,42
NA,question. B u t i t was never intended,42
NA,that they should be dropped indefinitely,42
NA,if the promise which was made by the,42
NA,State Premiers was not respected.,42
NA,soon as i t became evident that the State,42
NA,Parliaments did not intend to sanction,42
NA,"the proposition of the Prime Minister,",42
NA,I made i t my business to wait upon Mr .,42
NA,"Hughe's. I said to h i m : "" Y o u see how",42
NA,"things are g o i n g "" ; to which he replied,",42
NA,""" Y e s ; i t is very unfortunate."" I then",42
NA,r,42
NA,"said, "" The sooner we submit these pro-",42
NA,"posals to the people the better.""",42
Mr FINLAYSON ,I t was,42
NA,denied that the promise was made by the,42
NA,State Premiers.,42
Mr FENTON , W e know that the,42
NA,"promise was not worth much, i n view of",42
NA,the fact that the Legislative Councils of,42
NA,the States had power to prevent effect,42
NA,"being given to i t . A t that time, however,",42
NA,the State Governments were really afraid,42
NA,that i f the electors were afforded an op-,42
NA,"portunity to do so, they would hand over",42
NA,to this Parliament the powers which i t,42
NA,"sought, and accordingly they deemed i t",42
NA,wise to voluntarily offer to surrender,42
NA,them.,42
Mr YATES ,W e carried the proposals,42
NA,in South Australia on the second oc-,42
NA,casion.,42
Mr FENTON , I recognise that,42
NA,South Australia has always done' its,42
NA,duty i n that connexion. We have no,42
NA,right to delay in this matter. I f the,42
NA,"party opposite were in earnest, and i f the",42
NA,Prime Minister were in earnest in a de-,42
NA,sire to remove the disabilities under,42
NA,"which the people of Australia suffer, they",42
NA,would have submitted at the election i n,42
NA,1917 a proposal for the amendment of,42
NA,"the Constitution. Had that -been done,",42
NA,what would have been the result 1 See-,42
NA,"ing that we were even ""then feeling the",42
NA,"pinch of the profiteer and the exploiter,",42
NA,I believe that the people would have,42
NA,consented to the amendment necessary . I,42
NA,suppose that a proposal for the amend-,42
NA,ment of the Constitution w i l l be on the,42
NA,political menu which will be presented to,42
NA,the people at the coming elections. Every,42
NA,one knows what the Labour proposal will,42
NA,be. I t has been my individual proposal,42
NA,for a long time. I have long said that I,42
NA,questioned whether an ordinary amend-,42
NA,ment of the Constitution would be satis-,42
NA,factory. I say that every Constitution i n,42
NA,As Australia should be put into the melting,42
NA,"pot as soOn as possible, that we might",42
NA,draw from i t a National Parliament,42
NA,clothed with the powers which i t was,42
NA,originally believed this Parliament would,42
NA,possess. We could then delegate to,42
NA,provincial councils-no t State Parlia-,42
NA,ments-certai n powers which they might,42
NA,appropriately exercise. Under existing,42
NA,conditions the State Parliaments have,42
NA,delegated certain powers to this Parlia-,42
NA,afterwards ment and have kept us within well de-,42
NA,"fined limits, which we cannot overstep or",42
NA,the High Court will pull us up.,42
NA,The distress at present prevailing is of,42
NA,such a character that something should,42
NA,be done at once to relieve the people. We,42
NA,"cannot ignore the fact that men, women,",42
NA,and children who ought to be well,42
NA,"clothed, well housed, well fed, and f u l l y",42
NA,"employed are to-day ill-fed, ill-clothed,",42
NA,"ill-housed, and i n very many cases unem-",42
NA,ployed.,42
NA,NA,43
NA,come to their assistance ?,43
Mr FENTON ,Th e difficulty to,43
NA,which the honorable member refers is only,43
NA,"of a temporary character, and I am re-",43
NA,ferring to a permanent condition of af-,43
NA,"fairs, which was in existence prior to the",43
NA,disturbance to which he alludes. There,43
NA,arecommittees engaged i n my constitu-,43
NA,ency nearly all the year round collecting,43
NA,contributions i n money and clothing to,43
NA,m'ake. provision for those who' cannot pro-,43
NA,vide for themselves. Yet we boast that,43
NA,this is a free and well cared-for com-,43
NA,munity. Is i t any wonder that there,43
NA,should be discontent in this country 1,43
NA,What did the Prime Minister say,43
NA,"only the other day ? I n a few words,",43
NA,the right honorable gentleman put-,43
NA,as he <jan do very graphically and dra-,43
NA,matically-th e natural' consequence of the,43
NA,discontent to be found in the world to-,43
NA,day. When addressing a company of,43
NA,"workers Mr Hughes said, "" The profiteer",43
NA,"breeds Bolshevism."" Honorable members",43
NA,opposite know as well as 1^ do that that,43
NA,"is""the t r u t h . Y e t we sit 'down quietly",43
NA,and allow the profiteer to go on his way,43
NA,"arid, do riot l i f t a little finger to rescue",43
NA,those whom he has in his talons. We,43
NA,"cannot wonder, in the circumstances, that",43
NA,"there ate displays of discontent, not only",43
NA,"in this House, but outside. The workers",43
NA,went away in their numbers to. fight,43
NA,"against the common enemy, and i f there",43
NA,is one thing on which they have made,43
NA,up their minds i t is that those' dependent,43
NA,"upon them, and all living under similar",43
NA,"conditions, are going to have more of the",43
NA,good things of this life than they 'have,43
NA,had in the past. No matter what Go-,43
NA,"vernment may be in power, they w i l l be",43
NA,ignominiously pitched out of office by the,43
NA,people of this country if they do not,43
NA,"satisfy that demand, which is becoming",43
NA,more and more clamorous every day. Go,43
NA,where we will we find that the voices of,43
NA,"the small business man, the artisan, and",43
NA,the ordinary labourer are. ioined i n the,43
NA,"one complaint, "" We are being fleeced",43
NA,"and robbed."" Yet, with that united",43
NA,"voice of the people in our ears, legislators",43
NA,loll on the benches here .and do not l i f t a,43
NA,finger to redress the grievances of the,43
NA,people. I intend to give expres-,43
NA,sion to my opinion so long as Mr .,43
NA,Speaker is here to listen to me. As a,43
NA,representative of the people I have the,43
NA,right to make my voice heard in this,43
NA,"chamber, and 1 intend to do so as fre- -",43
NA,quently and as vigorously as I can i n,43
NA,order that some relief may be afforded to,43
NA,the people who are suffering. ',43
NA,I ask how honorable members think we,43
NA,would have got through the war i f the,43
NA,workers had stood aside. We know very,43
NA,well that i t is impossible to carry on any,43
NA,industry without the assistance of organ-,43
NA,ized labour. I shall quote an extract pre-,43
NA,sently to show what has been said' else-,43
NA,where regarding the necessity of ranging,43
NA,organized labour on the side of those,43
NA,who hope to do anything for the country.,43
NA,I t may be said that no voice was raised,43
NA,by the workers of the country i n support,43
NA,of the demand for proper organization to,43
NA,meet the conditions with which we would,43
NA,be faced on the return of our men from,43
NA,the Front. I n this connexion I shall,43
NA,quote what was said at a deputation to,43
NA,the then Acting Prime Minister (Senator,43
NA,Pearce) when the Prime Minister was ab-,43
NA,sent on his first visit to the Old Country.,43
NA,The deputation represented the Trades,43
NA,"Hall Council of Melbourne, and there",43
NA,"was present on i t also ,a South Aus-",43
NA,"tralian Minister, Mr Anstey, who hap-",43
NA,pened to be in Melbourne at the time.,43
NA,He heard that a deputation was to wait,43
NA,on the Acting Prime Minister i n regard,43
NA,"to the organization of industry, for the",43
NA,"time when our men would return, i n order",43
NA,"that unemployment would not be pre-,",43
NA,valent during the reconstruction after,43
NA,the war. The deputation waited on the,43
NA,Acting Prime Minister (Senator Pearce),43
NA,"on Friday, 24th March, 1916. There",43
NA,"were present, i n addition to those to",43
NA,"whom I have referred, a number of mem-",43
NA,bers of this House. A l l the speakers,43
NA,laid before Senator Pearce the necessity,43
NA,of organizing properly for the time when,43
NA,the demobilization of our troops would,43
NA,take place. I hope I shall not be con-,43
NA,sidered too egotistical i f I quote what I,43
NA,said myself on that occasion as giving ex-,43
NA,pression to my thoughts at the time. I,43
NA,said-,43
NA,Australia should remember that those who,43
NA,are now her Allies and best friends would be-,43
NA,"come her bitterest foes, so far as trade was",43
NA,"concerned, when the war was over, and i t",43
NA,would be worse than criminal if the Com-,44
NA,monwealth did nothing to prepare for that,44
NA,time when it came. When fhe word came that,44
NA,"the war was over, and i t might come suddenly,",44
NA,thousands of men would be thrown out of,44
NA,employment in Australia. The Commonwealth,44
NA,should be prepared to divert that labour into,44
NA,productive channels.,44
NA,Speeches of a similar character were de-,44
NA,livered by many at that deputation. Mr .,44
NA,"Hughes, prior to leaving f o r Great",44
NA,"Britain , had intimated hy a speech i n",44
NA,"this House, and .by some aotion he took,",44
NA,that the Governmenit intended to estab-,44
NA,lish a Bureau of Science and Industry.,44
NA,This was one of those high-flown titles,44
NA,"which are given to some organizations,",44
NA,"and which, though they impress some",44
NA,"people, never impress me. I never had",44
NA,very much f a i t h that this organization,44
NA,would do much for our Australian,44
NA,industries. We told Senator Pearce that,44
NA,"the Bureau would he of very slow growth,",44
NA,would probably be controlled by a num-,44
NA,"ber of university professors, and that",44
NA,very little benefit would accrue f r o m i t,44
NA,to the industries and workers of Austra-,44
NA,lia. We pointed out to h i m that organ-,44
NA,"ization as necessary, i n order to pre-",44
NA,pare for the time wheu the war had,44
NA,come to an end. I have not Senator,44
NA,"Pearce's reply to the deputation, but I",44
NA,can give the effect of i t . He said .that,44
NA,he quite realized that the representations,44
NA,made by the deputation were quite cor-,44
NA,"rect, that the Bureau of Science and I n -",44
NA,dustry could not meet all the demands o f,44
NA,"Australia, and would certainly not satisfy",44
NA,the people of Australia i n making their,44
NA,"industries prosperous, establishing new",44
NA,"industries, and providing employment fo r",44
NA,the people. He said he would take the,44
NA,representations of the deputation to Cabi-,44
NA,"net, and that the Government would en-",44
NA,deavour to evolve a scheme to meet itheir,44
NA,"wishes. I make hold to say that, had the",44
NA,Government at that time taken i n hand,44
NA,the propei' organization of industry i n,44
NA,"Australia, we would not be i n the muddle",44
NA,in which we find ourselves to-day in regard,44
NA,to demobilization and unemployment.,44
NA,"_WÂ© should bave done i t long ago, and",44
NA,"we are late in taking action', but we must",44
NA,do something i n this matter.,44
NA,I am sorry that the honorable,44
NA,"for Premantle is not here, because I pro-",44
NA,Mr Fenton.,44
NA,pose to make a quotation f r o m the Lon-,44
NA,don Times of 10 th May of this year. I,44
NA,"was looking over tbe file the other day,",44
NA,and f r o m the latest number on i t I ex-,44
NA,tracted many valuable quotations. In,44
NA,the Times of the 10th May of this year,44
NA,there is an article which contains the f o l -,44
NA,lowing statement:-,44
NA,I f the Government must depend primarily,44
NA,on the support of the House of Commons in,44
NA,the most decisive of all the .phases of the great,44
NA,"conflict, it is absolutely of the first import,",44
NA,ance that they should carry with them the,44
NA,great mass of organized labour.,44
NA,"That is the opinion of the London Times,",44
NA,and I believe i t is the opinion of Mr .,44
NA,Lloyd George. I believe that his efforts,44
NA,"have been, very largely i n that direction.",44
NA,I n the reconstruction period he is desir-,44
NA,ous of having behind h i m the whole body,44
NA,of organized labour. The Government i n,44
NA,Great B r i t a in are doing theiT best not to,44
NA,"antagonize organized labour, but to show",44
NA,themselves as friendly disposed to labour,44
NA,"as possible - They realize, as do many",44
NA,"writers of distinction i n the Old Country,",44
NA,that without the 'assistance of organized,44
NA,"labour, reconstruction after the war must",44
NA,be a terrible failure. That course is not,44
NA,being followed i n Australia. The,44
NA,workers of this country have recently,44
NA,been called by the most opprobrious,44
NA,names. We are called to order sometimes,44
NA,"for what is said on this side, but I re-",44
NA,member distinctly that only quite recently,44
NA,a certain honorable member on the other,44
NA,"side, pointing to the Ministerial 'benches",44
NA,"beneath him, said, "" We are the builders,""",44
NA,"and, pointing over to the Opposition,",44
NA,""" You are the wasters.""",44
Mr ARCHIBALD ,"Hear , hear!",44
Mr FENTON , T h e honoraible mem-,44
NA,ber is welcome to that opinion; but the,44
NA,"remark was disorderly, in the first place,",44
NA,and i t was also distinctly offensive and,44
NA,absolutely untrue. The leading men i n,44
NA,Great B r i t a in say to the representatives,44
NA,"of organized la'bour, "" We want you, w i th",44
NA,"all your force and wisdom, to come to our",44
NA,"assistance, to range yourselves behind us,",44
NA,"and help us i n reconstruction."" Here",44
NA,we are called by an ex-Labour man these,44
NA,"opprobrious names, which, i f Uttered out-",44
NA,"member side, would possibly lead to something",44
NA,more than a call to order.,44
Mr ARCHIBALD ,Honorabl e,45
NA,opposite bave nothing i n common with,45
NA,English industrialists.,45
Mr FENTON , A s the cap fits the,45
NA,"honorable member, he can wear i t . A l l",45
NA,"I can say is, that i f his antecedents w i l l",45
NA,bear as close a scrutiny as those of honor-,45
NA,"able members on this side, he has neason",45
NA,to be satisfied.,45
Mr ARCHIBALD ,The y w i l l bear closer,45
NA,scrutiny than will those of the honorable,45
NA,"member, who is a "" r a t "" f r o m Liberalism.",45
Mr SPEAKER , I ask the honorable,45
NA,member f o r Hindmarsh to withdraw that,45
NA,expression.,45
Mr ARCHIBALD , I withdraw i t .,45
Mr FENTON , I do not mind.,45
Mr SPEAKER , I t is not a question,45
NA,of who minds; i t is a question of order.,45
Mr FENTON , I regard a .remark,45
NA,of that kind-o r any other-fro m that,45
NA,quarter as a compliment. Another quoalways,45
NA,tation I desire to make is from remarks,45
NA,"made by President Wilson, who is supat",45
NA,posed to know something on these matbusiness,45
NA,ters. A f t e r the armistice was signed,45
NA,"said, speaking i n America-",45
NA,While the war lasted we set up many,45
NA,agencies by which to direct the industries,45
NA,the country in services it was necessary,45
NA,"them to render, but the moment .we knew tho",45
NA,armistice was signed we took the harness,45
NA,". . . In regard to foodstuffs and shipping,",45
NA,restraints are being relaxed as much as poscreasing.,45
NA,"sible, and will be more and more as the weeks",45
NA,go by.,45
NA,But this is the portion of the speech that,45
NA,I wish to emphasize particularly-,45
NA,The ordinary and normal processes of pri-,45
NA,"vate initiative will not, however, provide",45
NA,mediate employment for all the men of our,45
NA,returning armies. There will be a large,45
NA,"ing residuum of labour, which should not",45
NA,loft to shift wholly for itself. I t seems,45
NA,"important, therefore, that the development of",45
NA,public works of every sort should be promptly,45
NA,"resumed, in order that opportunities should",45
NA,"created for unskilled labour in particular,",45
NA,that plans should be made for such developf,45
NA,ments of our unused lands and our unused,45
NA,"natural resources, as we have hitherto",45
NA,stimulation to undertake.,45
NA,I know so.me press complaints have been,45
NA,made about suggestions i n tbis House not,45
NA,for providing employment.,45
NA,bers have suggested that we should make,45
NA,a start on the unification of the railway,45
NA,gauges; others have advised continuing,45
NA,"the Federal Capital works; and others,",45
NA,"members again, have urged that we should",45
NA,carry out the pledge given to South Aus-,45
NA,tralia by constructing the North-South,45
NA,"railway line. I n my judgment, while all",45
NA,"these works might, i n due season, receive",45
NA,"f u l l consideration, they w i l l not furnish",45
NA,immediate relief.,45
Mr RILEY ,Wha t about the unifica-,45
NA,tion of railway gauges?,45
Mr FENTON , I do not think we are,45
NA,ready f o r that proposal yet.,45
Mr RILEY , Y e s ; we have a l l the,45
NA,plans.,45
Mr FENTON ," B u t other work, of",45
NA,"greater urgency than any of these, can",45
NA,"be taken i n hand. Of course, money w i l l",45
NA,be required - I understand that one of,45
NA,the reasons advanced by the Federal and,45
NA,State Governments f o r not proceeding,45
NA,with public works is the lack of cash.,45
NA,"This is a poor plea, because money is",45
NA,available to a Government. Some,45
NA,people say that money may be obtained,45
NA,a price. I t seems to me to be good,45
NA,to pay a f a i r l y big price f o r,45
NA,"he money, or any other commodity, at cer-",45
NA,"tain times, f or the purpose of providing",45
NA,employment and preventing distress such,45
NA,of as exists at present in the ranks of our,45
NA,"for returned soldiers, as well as among the",45
NA,off ordinary people in the community.,45
Mr RILEY , A n d distress which is i n -,45
Mr FENTON ," Y e s , this distress is",45
NA,increasing. I am not here to give expres-,45
NA,sion to those eruptions that take place now,45
NA,"and again, but i t appears to me that",45
NA,imwhat is happening now is symptomatic of,45
NA,the feelings i n the community. For i n -,45
NA,"floatstance, I believe i t is an absolute fact",45
NA,be that i n the constituency represented by,45
NA,"to me the last speaker, the honorable member",45
NA,"for Fremantle ( Mr Burchell), i t was",45
NA,"be necessary^ recently, to restrain 200 re-",45
NA,"and turned soldiers, who were unemployed,",45
NA,r o m doing something serious by march-,45
NA,"lacked ing them through the various streets,",45
NA,singing songs u n t i l they had cooled down.,45
NA,"This distress is present among soldiers,",45
NA,"only i n Australia, but i n Great B r i -",45
NA,Some memtain also. I f any honorable member cares,45
NA,to read the English files-he w i l l not find,45
NA,this information i n the daily press of,45
NA,"Australia, because i t is carefully excluded",45
NA,i n order to keep the people here i n the,45
NA,dark-he will learn something of what,46
NA,is happening on the other side of the,46
NA,"world. I believe, however, that the sol-",46
NA,diers are making themselves,46
NA,Great Britain to a greater extent than is,46
NA,"the case here, and that the Imperial Go-",46
NA,vernment are making greater efforts to,46
NA,redress their grievances.,46
NA,"knew, when the war broke out, that a con-",46
NA,siderable sum of money would be needed,46
NA,"to pay our troops overseas, and while on",46
NA,"war service, and to provide for their pen-",46
NA,"sions and repatriation. Why, then, did",46
NA,not the Parliament exercise some of its,46
NA,"powers, limited as they are under the",46
NA,"Constitution, to obtain more",46
NA,Why did not the Government,46
NA,"all insurance business-life,",46
NA,marine? I would even disregard any State,46
NA,proposition. At the outset of the war the,46
NA,British Government took over the whole of,46
NA,"the marine insurance business, and made",46
NA,millions of p unds. Their control of this,46
NA,business is now helping them to pay the,46
NA,bill. Whv should not Australia do the,46
NA,"same, and obtain some of the big revenue",46
NA,that at present flows into the pockets of,46
NA,"private individuals. Prance, 1 suppose,",46
NA,"has done more in this direction,",46
NA,enjoys more State monopolies than in,46
NA,any other countries. The latest,46
NA,activity in France is the,46
NA,in the supply of petrol to tho Prench,46
NA,"people, by which the French",46
NA,"expect to make Â£1,500,000 a year.",46
NA,should we not do the same in Australia?,46
NA,Why should not the Government,46
NA,"all supplies of kerosene, petrol, and other",46
NA,oils in Australia? Something should be,46
NA,done to develop the oil supplies of Papua,46
NA,and investigate our own resources.,46
NA,would pay this House to set apart next,46
NA,Wednesday afternoon for the discussion,46
NA,"of this subject, and to pass a vote of",46
NA,"Â£500,000 for the development of our re-",46
NA,"sources by boring, and the",46
NA,ment of such experts as Lord,46
NA,dray obtained in Great Britain.,46
NA,centuries the geologists of Great,46
NA,ain had declared that,46
NA,no oil deposits within,46
NA,"Kingdom., but quite recently a supply has",46
NA,"been obtained at 3,000 feet. I understand",46
NA,"a bore is yielding 400 gallons per day,",46
NA,and it is expected that further,46
NA,will very largely increase the,46
NA,itfr. Fenton.,46
NA,The opinion of a geologist need not be,46
NA,regarded as final. Events have proved,46
NA,that a first class practical oil-borer- a,46
NA,heard in man thoroughly conversant with oil dis-,46
NA,covery i n all its phases-i s often the bet-,46
NA,ter man to decide this important ques-,46
NA,tion.,46
NA,Everybody I deplore the apathy in regard,46
NA,to the oil resources of Australia.,46
NA,For some years boring operations,46
NA,have been carried out i n South Aus-,46
NA,"tralia, and we are extracting oil from",46
NA,our shale deposits in other parts of the,46
NA,Commonwealth. I believe that even-,46
NA,tually large supplies will be obtained,46
NA,"revenue? f r o m Papua, but greater vigour'should be",46
NA,take over displayed i n research and i n exploratory,46
NA,"fire, and work. The proper course is to nationalize",46
NA,the distribution of oil supplies through-,46
NA,"out the Commonwealth, and to do away'",46
NA,"altogether with private' enterprise, thus",46
NA,securing for the Commonwealth revenue,46
NA,the large profits that are at present being,46
NA,hiade out of the business. I speak as,46
NA,one who has resided in the country dur-,46
NA,"ing the past twelve months, and . whose",46
NA,illuminant is kerosene. I . know only too,46
NA,well how great has been the increase i n its',46
NA,"and price as compared with the time when,",46
NA,"first"".I lived i n the country i n 1902. W e",46
NA,State have now to pay nearly three times aq,46
NA,monopoly much for a t i n of kerosene. Why is this,46
NA,so? Some people say i t is because ship-,46
NA,"Government ping is short. I know, however, that that",46
NA,is not the only reason. I remember read-,46
NA,Why,46
NA,"ing that when America entered the war,",46
NA,"the Secretary of the United, States Trea-",46
NA,"control sury, Mr MCAdoo, declared that i t",46
NA,would be necessary to levy heavy income,46
NA,taxation upon the people of the United,46
NA,"States, and he had some figures prepared",46
NA,It indicating how the wealthier individuals,46
NA,of the Republic would be taxed. Rocke-,46
NA,"feller, the great oil king, was shown to",46
NA,"have an income of about Â£12,000,000 per",46
NA,"annum, and under the new income tax",46
NA,employ- schedule he would be called upon to pay,46
NA,"Cow- about Â£7,500,000 a year to the United",46
NA,For States Treasury. Some people might,46
NA,Brit- think this was a pretty heavy impost; but,46
NA,"there were Rockefeller stretched out his long arm,",46
NA,the United and w i t h his big fist he is now dragging,46
NA,from every user of American kerosene an,46
NA,extra price for this particular commo-,46
NA,dity. Every other user of kerosene i n,46
NA,borings the Commonwealth is now helping to pay,46
NA,"supply, Rockefeller's taxation to the United",46
NA,States Treasury. Can i t be expected,47
NA,that people who are on the verge of star-,47
NA,vation will sit down quietly when they,47
NA,know that men like Rockefeller are day,47
NA,by day delving into their pockets and,47
NA,taking from them money which they can,47
NA,so i l l afford to spare ? I well remember,47
NA,what thc Acting Prime Minister ( Mr .,47
NA,W a t t) said when the .then,47
NA,Minister ( Mr Andrew Fisher) i n-,47
NA,troduced his first Income Tax and,47
NA,Probate B i l l . The Acting Prime M i n -,47
NA,"ister, who was then a free lance, said he",47
NA,knew that a large number of people would,47
NA,"be called upon to pay the tax because,",47
NA,"and he added, "" There is going on i n",47
NA,"every community a filtration process, and",47
NA,this impost will filter down and down,47
NA,"until i t reaches bedrock,"" Bedrock, he",47
NA,"added, was represented by the working",47
NA,"people of this country, who, because they",47
NA,"could not pass i t on, would have to carry",47
NA,the burden. Not only are the people,47
NA,"being charged exorbitant rates for food,",47
NA,"clothing, and on every article i n every-",47
NA,"day use, but they know they have to",47
NA,pay the rich man's taxes as well. W i t h,47
NA,this galling fact staring them i n the,47
NA,"face, are they going to -sit down q u i e t l y '",47
NA,Can i t be expected that they will be,47
NA,..amiable when they know that this rob-,47
NA,- bery is.going on? I say that unless,47
NA,"some redress is given, not only shall we",47
NA,hear the stamping of the feet and the,47
NA,".shouting of voices, but I fear something",47
NA,worse will happen i n this country.,47
Mr FLEMING ,Nonsense !,47
Mr FENTON , I tell honorable mem-,47
NA,bers opposite that the patience of,47
NA,people is at breaking point. There are,47
NA,'.thousands of people i n every part of,47
NA,"tralia who will not tolerate the present ' has happened recently, however.",47
NA,condition of affairs very much longer.,47
NA,There are some people who w i l l not join i t,47
NA,"vigorously i n a movement, but",47
NA,"help, nevertheless, as much as they can.",47
NA,They include the large bulk of what,47
NA,be described as the middle class.,47
NA,sympathies of that class are inevitably able position.,47
NA,turning more and more to the workers and,47
NA,-their representatives as the only medium,47
NA,of redress. I do not want to see this,47
NA,"thing come about, and w i l l do my best",47
NA,to prevent i t ; but f r o m what I have,47
NA,am convinced that present conditions,47
NA,not last. Are we never going to wake,47
NA,and do something f o r the people?,47
NA,are told there is no money. This Govern-,47
NA,ment is wasting money. I have referred,47
NA,to the Bureau of Science and Industry.,47
NA,"As a printer, I am always interested i n",47
NA,good letterpress work. I t is well under-,47
NA,stood that better work can be done on,47
NA,good quality paper than upon inferior ma-,47
NA,terial. W i t h certain delicate plates i t is,47
NA,Prime necessary to have a smooth-surfaced paper,47
NA,in order to present the best possible pic-,47
NA,ture. Honorable members have received,47
NA,copies of the Journal of Science and I n -,47
NA,dustry. I invite them to examine the,47
NA,"quality of its paper, and to ask themselves",47
NA,whether there is justification f o r any,47
NA,Government organization issuing its jour-,47
NA,nal upon such 'expensive and beautiful,47
NA,hand-made paper.,47
Mr WATKINS , A l l f o r the publication,47
NA,of treatises on bugs!,47
Mr FENTON , I t is a w i l f u l waste of,47
NA,money to allow these people to air their,47
NA,"fads on the best paper, procurable. I",47
NA,admit that i n the matter of departmental,47
NA,usage of paper the Postmaster-General,47
NA,has gone to the other extreme. The tele-,47
NA,grams issued by his Department are so,47
NA,"difficult to open, owing to the shocking",47
NA,"quality of the paper, that they are a dis-",47
NA,grace to the Department. A t theother,47
NA,"end of the scale, however, the w i l f u l waste",47
NA,perpetrated by an institution which pro-,47
NA,fesses to do a great deal i n behalf of i n -,47
NA,dustry amounts to a scandalous shame.,47
NA,"The Public Accounts Committee, i n a",47
NA,"'recently' submitted report, indicated to the",47
NA,.the Government where they already possess,47
NA,suitable sites for buildings for branches,47
NA,Ausof the Public Service. . Witness what,47
NA,The,47
NA,Repatriation Department notified that,47
NA,had outgrown - its East Mel-,47
NA,will bourne quarters-tha t its requirements,47
NA,"were about 40,000 square feet of space.",47
NA,may The Commonwealth Property Officer was,47
NA,The requested to endeavour to secure a suit-,47
NA,"He made investigations,",47
NA,and recommended that i f - the Repatria-,47
NA,tion Department required land with build-,47
NA,"ings on i t, i t was-believed that, with the",47
NA,"consent of the Governor-General, an area",47
NA,seen I could be obtained in the neighbourhood of,47
NA,canthe Young Men's. Christian Association,47
NA,up Rest H u t . I t appears that finally the,47
NA,We Federal Government agreed to lease,47
NA,"from the Victorian Government, for a",48
NA,"period of twenty-one years, the site",48
NA,on St. Kilda-road recently occupied,48
NA,by Hoadley's Chocolate Factory.,48
NA,intended to pay the interest on the sum,48
NA,with which the State Government pur-,48
NA,chased that site-a n item amounting to,48
NA,Â£400 per annum. That may be regarded,48
NA,by certain people as a mere bagatelle. B u t,48
NA,i t is when such comparatively small,48
NA,amounts are heaped on each other that a,48
NA,huge aggregate is discovered.,48
NA,that particular site required? There is,48
NA,land available i n the Victoria Barracks,48
NA,yard which should amply serve the re-,48
NA,quirements of the Repatriation Depart-,48
NA,ment. There is also a large area at pre-,48
NA,sent carrying only some old iron build-,48
NA,"ings, at the corner of St. Kilda-",48
NA,"road and Wadey-street, at the northern",48
NA,end of the Barracks block. I t is oc-,48
NA,cupied now by the Victorian police.,48
NA,"has an area of, approximately, 84,000",48
NA,"square feet, with a frontage of 135 feet",48
NA,"to St. Kilda-road, 458 feet to Wadey-",48
NA,"street, and 198 feet to Wells-street. The",48
NA,report of the Accounts Committee points,48
NA,out that i f a building were to be erected,48
NA,on that land i t would not be architectur-,48
NA,ally necessary to conform to the style of,48
NA,"the existing Barracks, which are built of",48
NA,bluestone. I f the Government are keen,48
NA,"upon improving a property at all, why",48
NA,should they not improve their own ? Tt,48
NA,"appears, however, that they prefer to go",48
NA,"further afield, and to construct tempor-",48
NA,"ary buildings on the Hoadley site, for",48
NA,which block they are to pay an item of,48
NA,interest amounting to Â£400 per annum.,48
NA,"Further, there is the prospect at any time",48
NA,that they may have to quit that property,48
NA,and be forced to seek shelter elsewhere.,48
NA,One might multiply instances of public,48
NA,money being utterly wasted. . So fa r as I,48
NA,"am concerned, if any word or influence of",48
NA,mine can save even Â£ 1 0 for the public,48
NA,"purse, I shall deem i t worth my while.",48
NA,NA,48
NA,back again !,48
Mr FENTON , I do not know whether,48
NA,we want him back again or not; but we,48
NA,need to infuse into the Government a,48
NA,little practical common sense.,48
Mr JOWETT ,Wha t about Canberra?,48
Mr FENTON ,Probabl y the honor-,48
NA,able member and myself will be found on,48
NA,the same side when i t comes to a vote,48
NA,upon that project. I am not particular,48
NA,as to the company I keep i n a matter of,48
NA,I t is tliat kind.,48
NA,No returned soldier desires to put a,48
NA,"breadwinner out of his position, particu-",48
NA,larly i f that individual has done his best,48
NA,"to get to .the Front, and has not suc-",48
NA,ceeded. Y e f such things are happening.,48
NA,I am certain that the returned men them-,48
NA,selves would be among the first to pro-,48
NA,Why is test. A gentleman i n the city waited,48
NA,upon me yesterday i n regard to the case,48
NA,"of a man who, for a number of years,",48
NA,has been employed by a big public finan-,48
NA,cial institution. M y informant told me,48
NA,"he was a fine, trustworthy, fellow. He",48
NA,"has now received notice, however, that",48
NA,"he is to be discharged, and that his",48
NA,place is to be taken by a returned sol-,48
NA,dier. The man has a wife and five chil-,48
NA,It dren to support. He did his best to go,48
NA,"to the Front. He enlisted, and was sent",48
NA,"to Broadmeadows Camp, where he re-",48
NA,mained f or five weeks. When a strict,48
NA,"medical examination was made, however;",48
NA,he was discharged as unfit for active mili-,48
NA,"tary service, and. he returned to his posi-",48
NA,tion. Now that individual must go out.,48
Mr FOWLER , I know of the case of a,48
NA,man who fought i n three campaigns prior,48
NA,"to this last, and who was not accepted",48
NA,"for the Great W a r ; but he was "" sacked,""",48
NA,and a man put i n his place who had never,48
NA,left this country.,48
Mr FENTON ,"Suc h things are, un-",48
NA,"doubtedly, happening. The man to whom",48
NA,"I have referred, and who is the bread-",48
NA,"winner f or six others, is to be thrown",48
NA,out on a literally and metaphorically cold,48
NA,world. There is nothing for him to do.,48
NA,Such a system will not lead to proper,48
NA,"demobilization, or to the establishment of",48
NA,contentment throughout the community.,48
NA,The fiat should go forth f r o m the,48
NA,Acting Prime Minister ( Mr W a t t ),48
NA,that i n such cases there shall not,48
NA,be disturbance of employment. There,48
NA,have been bungles i n regard to re-,48
NA,"patriation, some of which occurred",48
NA,merely because the organization of relief,48
NA,was not begun soon enough. President,48
NA,"Wilson said, immediately after the armis-",48
NA,"tice, "" Now, you American governmental",48
NA,"departments, get busy! Do not wait",48
NA,upon private initiative. The Government,48
NA,must establish works to provide employhibition,49
NA,"ment for our people."" That was the",49
NA,"right attitude, and i t was prompt. We",49
NA,have made no such preparations.,49
NA,"W i t h regard to the Tariff, honorable",49
NA,members opposite hold that i t is right,49
NA,that we should wait for the return of,49
NA,"Mr Hughes, so that we may ascertain the",49
NA,proposals of the British Government.,49
NA,What bunkum! There are items i n the,49
NA,Tariff concerning which we are entirely,49
NA,independent of Great Britain . Thousands,49
NA,of items are of a purely Australian,49
NA,"character, and give employment solely",49
NA,to Australians. W h y wait? A n interim,49
NA,Tariff should have been introduced long,49
NA,ago. Certain industries to-day are detime,49
NA,pendent on the sometimes slender and,49
NA,brittle thread of Ministerial promises.,49
NA,But -in some cases the thread has,49
NA,snapped. The promises of the Prime,49
NA,Minister ( Mr Hughes) have not been,49
NA,"kept, and, as a result, very many",49
NA,people have been thrown out of employpassed,49
NA,ment. Even the honorable member f,49
NA,Robertson ( Mr Fleming) would not,49
NA,"bark on a big industry, entailing large",49
NA,"penditure, simply on a Ministerial proan up-to-date Tariff.",49
NA,"mise. Some people did so, however,",49
NA,regarding the promise as emphatic; and,49
NA,"what is required, in the light",49
NA,"perience, is something i n black and white",49
NA,in a Statute by way of protection. To,49
NA,"their shame, there are people i n Australia",49
NA,"who, when i t became known that, i n con-",49
NA,"sequence of the war, shipping would",49
NA,"short, and travelling to Europe dangerous,",49
NA,scuttled to Japan to arrange to bring slavery.,49
NA,"goods manufactured in that country to tunately,",49
NA,Australia as quickly as possible.,49
NA,quantity of such goods has increased by,49
NA,"leaps and bounds, and I ask: What hope",49
NA,"have we, under Australian conditions,",49
NA,meeting such competition? I n some,49
NA,articles recently published i n a Melbourne,49
NA,newspaper we are told of thousands,49
NA,boys and girls being kept i n compounds i,49
NA,order that they may work for long hours,49
NA,each day i n factories for a wage of,49
NA,4$d. per head. The result is that there,49
NA,are Australians here who are buying goods,49
NA,created out of the blood and sweat of little,49
NA,Japanese children. How can Australian,49
NA,industries flourish under such conditions?,49
NA,"Allied or not, we must have absolute procompany,",49
NA,[389],49
NA,i f we are to protect Australian,49
NA,industries f r o m competition of this kind.,49
NA,T do not know how the Free Traders pro-,49
NA,"pose to meet the position, but I have heard",49
NA,that some of them have been converted,49
NA,from their fiscal theories and fallacies; at,49
NA,"any rate, they desire to make this coun-",49
NA,"try, so f u l l as i t is of raw material of",49
NA,"every kind, as nearly self-contained as",49
NA,possible. Week by week men and women,49
NA,"are being thrown out of employment, f o r",49
NA,the simple reason that Australia is using,49
NA,goods made under the conditions I have,49
NA,indicated. The highest wage paid to the,49
NA,most skilled artisan i n Japan is about ls .,49
NA,"6d. per day, and i t is only during war-",49
NA,that the work people have been able,49
NA,to extract an extra 6d. We cannot profess,49
NA,to maintain the principle of a White Aus-,49
NA,tralia i f the ports of the country are,49
NA,thrown open to the products of cheap,49
NA,labour of this kind. There would have,49
NA,been a certain guarantee to those who,49
NA,desired to start industries here i f we had,49
NA,an interim Tariff. Had that been,49
NA,"o r done, we could, at' the close of the war,",49
NA,emhave considered our fiscal arrangements,49

NA,Since the war terminated not only trade,50
NA,unionists and working people generally,50
NA,are asking for protection in England. I,50
NA,saw in the Times a great page advertise-,50
NA,"ment, calling on the middle classes to",50
NA,"form one great union, and there is a pro-",50
NA,"visional executive, including many mem-",50
NA,bers of the House of Commons. The ob-,50
NA,ject is to have some organization by,50
NA,means of which the voice of the middle,50
NA,classes may be heard in. the efforts to,50
NA,some of the problems which confront the,50
NA,"Old Country, and to safeguard them from",50
NA,being made the dupes and victims of pro-,50
NA,fiteers. There is the same need in Aus-,50
NA,"tralia for some such action, and, although",50
NA,"I am a member of the Labour party, I",50
NA,believe that if I were to convene a meeting,50
NA,of those who call themselves the middle,50
NA,classes-though it might be difficult to,50
NA,define them-the attendance would be,50
NA,overflowing. Mr Knibbs can work out,50
NA,"his figures to the nicest fraction, but any",50
NA,intelligent house-wife will tell you what,50
NA,a difference there is between ber bills five,50
NA,or six years ago and her bills to-day in,50
NA,"the matter of groceries, clothing, and so",50
NA,"forth. Indeed, it is a marvel to me how",50
NA,"many in this, community manage to livq.",50
NA,The other night I was addressing a meet-,50
NA,"ing, and mentioned, that so far as I could",50
NA,"make out, f l in 1910 would purchase as",50
NA,"much as Â£1 13s. lOd. will to-day, and an",50
NA,interjector called out that the difference,50
NA,was really much greater. After the meeting,50
NA,"the man who had interjected told me that,",50
NA,"employed on the wheat stacks, he earned",50
NA,"Â£4 7s. a week, and that after providing",50
NA,"for rent, union dues, and for his wife and",50
NA,"six children, there was so little left that",50
NA,he could not afford to buy a decent suit,50
NA,in which to attend his union meetings.,50
NA,I could not disbelieve the man; and if,50
NA,"that is the case witli a wage of Â£4 7s.,",50
NA,what must be the conditions iu homes,50
NA,where the average earnings are Â£2 10s.,50
NA,"to Â£3, and where the families are equally",50
NA,"large, or larger. In my own electorate T",50
NA,find the streets where the working classes,50
NA,"live full of youngsters, whereas in the",50
NA,"more "" toffy "" parts hardly a child can be",50
NA,seen playing about. The working men,50
NA,Mr Fenton.,50
NA,are the greatest producers in the country,50
NA,"in more senses than one, and they provide",50
NA,"that great essential, human beings.",50
NA,"I know the electors of Dalley, for I",50
NA,lived there as far back as 1886; and I do,50
NA,not wonder at the honorable member ( Mr.,50
NA,Mahony) pleading for the women and,50
NA,children who are suffering from hunger.,50
NA,Can we be surprised at the honorable,50
NA,member bursting the bounds of ordinary,50
NA,"decorum, and smashing into smithereens",50
NA,"the rules of this or any other House,",50
NA,when he thinks of the awful distress that,50
NA,solve prevails in that industrial centre. The,50
NA,Government must be held distinctly crim-,50
NA,inal if they allow the present state of,50
NA,"things to continue, seeing that it can be",50
NA,"so easily prevented. ""What is the good of",50
NA,"the Government providing Â£1,000 to be",50
NA,doled out in relief? Our people do not,50
NA,want doles; 'they have proved their inde-,50
NA,pendence on the battle-field and on the,50
NA,"cricket and football fields, and, manly",50
NA,"and womanly as they are, they hate such",50
NA,charity. What they demand is work to,50
NA,"exercise their muscles and brain, so that",50
NA,they may increase the wealth of the coun-,50
NA,"try, and enable us to . meet the present",50
NA,financial position. Starvation and unem-,50
NA,ployment never did any country any good.,50
NA,Have we no national spirit or spirit of,50
NA,"humanity? I n Great Britain, even iu the",50
NA,"university arena, i t is being realized that",50
NA,something must be done. But uni-,50
NA,versity appointments will not create,50
NA,"bread, and i t is work and bread",50
NA,that are wanted now. The work-,50
NA,ing people have made this country,50
NA,"what it is, and they and their children",50
NA,ought to have a chance. With vigorous,50
NA,"men and women, well fed and well clothed,",50
NA,Australia has a great future. Our agri-,50
NA,cultural areas are a mere nothing com-,50
NA,pared with the value of human souls; let,50
NA,us in all our legislation do that which will,50
NA,bring some relief to the sufferers in our,50
NA,"community. I wish to see Australia, liv-",50

NA,The return of the troops in Egypt was f u l ly,51
NA,provided for with the general demobilization,51
NA,"scheme, ancl ships were allotted, insuring that",51
NA,these troops arrived in Australia in the same,51
NA,proportion and about tile same time as the,51
NA,troops in France and England. Owing to the,51
NA,"serious riots in Egypt, the General Officer",51
NA,Commanding there suspended the demobiliza-,51
NA,"tion arrangements, and .utilized the troops for",51
NA,"quelling the disturbances, which were of a",51
NA,serious nature. I t was thought that this sus-,51
NA,"pension would only, mean a matter of a few",51
NA,"weeks delay, but, as i t appeared to be longer,",51
NA,tinCommonwealth Government took up the,51
NA,"matter with the Imperial Authorities, and",51
NA,strongly objected to the delay in demobiliza-,51
NA,"tion, and to tho Australian troops being used",51
NA,as part of the Army of Occupation in Egypt.,51
NA,"A.s a result of these representations, conducted",51
NA,in England by tlie Prime Minister ( Mr.,51
NA,Hughes) and the Minister for Defence (Sena-,51
NA,"tor Pearce), the Imperial Authorities decided",51
NA,"to relieve the Australian troops of this duty,",51
NA,and the shipping authorities were directed to,51
NA,provide ships as soon as possible for their re-,51
NA,turn to Australia. As a result of this action.,51
NA,PAPERS. eight ships were allotted for conveyance of,51
NA,"Australian troops from Egypt, and the 'de-",51
NA,were premobilization is now in f u l l swing. The sys-,51
NA,tem adopted for demobilization of the Egypt,51
NA,troops is to return them to Australia by,51
NA,units. Prior to the suspension of demobiliza-,51
NA,"tion, the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Regiments",51
NA,"had left Egypt, and havo since reached Aus-",51
NA,tralia and been demobilized. The 3rd Regi-,51
NA,"ment reached Australia last week, and the",51
NA,4th Regiment is now nearing Australia. Ad-,51
NA,vices have just been received to the eifect that,51
NA,"the 5th, 0th, and 7th Regiments embarked",51
NA,"and sailed on 2Sth June, and thc Sth Regiment",51
NA,aud Anzac Divisional Details embarked and,51
NA,sailed yesterday. The total number of Ligh t,51
NA,Horse Regiments in Egypt was fourteen. I t,51
NA,is anticipated that the remaining six w i l l cm-,51
NA,"bark in the ships allocated, and leave Egypt",51
NA,"before tlie end of the month. I t will, there-",51
NA,"fore, be seen that the return of these troops is",51
NA,now being accelerated and proceeding as fast,51

NA,FREEMAN CASE: MR . CORBOULD: DOCTOR,51
NA,"ON s.s. "" SONOMA.""",51
NA,TROOPS. Motion (by Mr WATT) proposed-,51
NA,That thc House do now adjourn.,51
Mr FINLAYSON ,Brisbane) [4.5] -,51
NA,"OnWednesday last, 2'eference was made",51
NA,"to the Freeman case, and the Acting",51
NA,e,51
NA,i k e l y to Prime Minister ( Mr Watt) said that he,51
NA,would make inquiries as to the possibility,51
NA,"of holding an investigation into the case,",51
NA,"and, in reference to the alleged intention",51
NA,"of a very material witness- Mr Corbould,",51
NA,manager of a mine in the Cloncurry dis-,51
NA,trict-t o leave Australia. I have re-,51
NA,ceived three telegrams from Brisbane on,51
NA,this matter. One reads as follows:-,51
NA,As an old miner and ex-soldier request your,51
NA,utmost detain this alleged patriot Corbould.,51
NA,The Freeman case i3 only a typical one.,51
NA,"Therefore, there is all the more reason",51
NA,for exercising the utmost care in regard,51
NA,to witnesses who may possibly be re-,51
NA,quired. Mr Corbould-th e man alleged,51
NA,to have supplied the statement upon,51
NA,which Mr Freeman was arrested-i s,51
NA,such a material witness in connexion,51
NA,"with any inquiry which may take place,",51
NA,"that, i f he is allowed to leave Australia",51
NA,by the permission of the Government,51
NA,"through the issue of a. passport, an un-",51
NA,fortunate feeling will arise in the minds,51
NA,of the public that the Government are,51
NA,not anxious that a proper inquiry should,51
NA,be held. Hi3 departure may defeat the,51
NA,ends of justice. I hope Ministers w i l l,52
NA,NA,52
NA,"given a f a i r trial or mot, or, at any rate,",52
NA,"until that question is decided, Mr Cor-",52
NA,bould wtill not be allowed to leave Aus-,52
NA,"tralia. I f an inquiry is to be held, he",52
NA,will be needed as a witness. I f an i n -,52
NA,"quiry is not to be held, some other action",52
NA,must be taken.,52
NA,A considerable amount of public inte-,52
NA,"rest has been aroused, particularly i n New",52
NA,"South Wales, in regard to this case, and",52
NA,it is spreading. The gentleman whose,52
NA,telegram I have just read was a miner,52
NA,in the Cloncurry district f o r years before,52
NA,"he went to the waT, and returned to Aus-",52
NA,tralia about a month ago. As he has,52
NA,just got back to Brisbane after a visit,52
NA,"to his friends i n the north, he should have",52
NA,a f u l l knowledge of the facts. I hope,52
NA,that action w i l l be taken to prevent Mr .,52
NA,Corbould f r o m leaving Australia u n t i l the,52
NA,question of Mr Freeman's liberty is de-,52
NA,"cided, or until an inquiry is held which",52
NA,w i l l determine his future position.,52
Mr KELLY ,Wentworth) [4.8] - I,52
NA,wish to say a word or two i n connexion,52
NA,w i th the Freemam case without trespass-,52
NA,ing upon the merits of the dispute be-,52
NA,tween Freeman and his supporters on,52
NA,the one side and the Defence Department,52
NA,on the other. A side of the case which,52
NA,seems to have been lost sight of is the,52
NA,position of the doctor on the s.s. Sonoma.,52
NA,"No doubt, the shipping company wished",52
NA,"to get r i d of ain unwelcome visitor, but",52
NA,its doctor seems to have trespassed be-,52
NA,yond the bounds of decency i n getting,52
NA,"rid of him, because I find that both",52
NA,"morning newspapers i n Sydney, i n de-",52
NA,"scribing "" the imminent death "" of Free-",52
NA,"man, reported that 'the doctor on the s.s.",52
NA,Sonoma had said that Freeman's tem-,52
NA,"perature was down to 93, and that he was",52
NA,"on the verge of collapse. I t was found,",52
NA,when Freeman was removed to the m i l i -,52
NA,"tary hospital, that his temperature was",52
NA,"98.3, and I am quite sure i t was the cor-",52
NA,"rect temperature, because I know that i n",52
NA,the case of a perfectly healthy man a few,52
NA,"days' starvation w i l l do h i m no harm,",52
NA,provided he has an ample supply of,52
NA,water. A personal friend of mine does,52
NA,himself very well f o r six months of the,52
NA,"year, and then has ten days' rigid fastj",52
NA,but during that ten days he doe3 all his,52
NA,physical exercises and the other things,52
NA,"necessary to keep him i n good condition,",52
NA,and he looks just as well at the end of,52
NA,that period as he did at the beginning of,52
NA,it.,52
Mr HIGGS ,Tw o honorable members,52
NA,have been suspended to-day f o r referring,52
NA,to the fact that certain people had to,52
NA,undergo a compulsory fast.,52
Mr KELLY ,If the honorable mem-,52
NA,ber is disposed to get up a personal sub-,52
NA,scription for those unfortunate people,52
NA,who have been -thrown out of work,52
NA,"through no fault of their own, I shall",52
NA,"do my utmost to help him, but that is a",52
NA,different thing altogether. I would like,52
NA,to know whether the Acting Attorney-,52
NA,General will take into consideration the,52
NA,apparent fraud of the doctor of the s.s.,52
NA,Sonoma.,52
Mr WEST ,Th e honorable member,52
NA,should not make that charge when the,52
NA,man is not here to answer i t .,52
Mr KELLY , H e can easily answer,52
NA,i t. I f there was not fraud on the part of,52
NA,"the doctor, then there was the most extra-",52
NA,"ordinary conspiracy on, the part of the",52
NA,newspaper reporters. I should hesitate,52
NA,to believe that they conspired to say that,52
NA,Freeman's temperature was 93 when a,52
NA,few hours afterwards i t was actually 98.3.,52
Mr TUDOR ,Wha t power have the Go-,52
NA,vernment over the doctor of the s.s.,52
NA,Sonoma? He is probably an American,52
NA,citizen.,52
Mr KELLY ," T h a t may be so, and",52
NA,"he is probably laughing heartily now,",52
NA,and may laugh heartily when he reads,52
NA,my remarks. B u t i t is a very dangerous,52
NA,laugh that would cause the feeling there,52
NA,was in Sydney at that time. There was,52
NA,a great deal of public sympathy f o r a,52
NA,man who ' ' was starving and on the verge,52
NA,"of collapse"" which Freeman could not",52
NA,have been i f he was taking water. That,52
NA,fact seems to be well established. The,52
NA,doctor of the vessel seems to have done,52
NA,"his best to cheat public sympathy, and",52
NA,I would like the Acting Attorney-Gene-,52
NA,ral to see whether his behaviour brings,52
NA,him within the compass of the laws qf,52
NA,the Commonwealth.,52

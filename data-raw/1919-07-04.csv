8,Mr CONSIDINE ,"Barrier) [11.3] When the debate was adjourned last evening, I was pointing out that the Ministerial statement-' presented by the Acting Prime Minister did not contain even a hint that the Government proposed to take any steps to deal with the Trusts and Combines which are operating in the Commonwealth, .and which were so roundly condemned last evening by several Ministerial supporters. There can be no doubt that Trusts and Combines have Australia in their grip. The Beef Trust is operating strongly in the Commonwealth today. In a report presented by a Commission appointed by the United States Government to inquire into the Chicago Meat Trust and its ramifications, quotations from which appeared in the Barrier Daily Truth of 5th A p r i l last, there is given a list of the operations of the Beef Trust in various countries. According to the report of the Commission, Armour and Company, of the Meat Trust, are represented in Australia and New Zealand by Armour and Company, of Australasia, and Swif t Company, also members of the Trust, are represented in Australia by the Australian Meat Export Company. The Commission reported thatTlie Commission had to meet deliberate falsification of returns properly required under legal authority; we had to meet schools for witnesses, where employees were coached in anticipation of their being called to testify in an investigation ordered by you (President Wilson) and by the Congress of the United States; we had to meet a situation created by the destruction of letters and documents vital to this investigation; we had to meet a conspiracy in the preparation of answers to the lawful inquiries of the Commission. The public were told that no "" Trust"" existed, and that the "" Big Five "" were in most effective competition, but the report declares that "" these five .corporations and their 500 odd subsidiary, controlled, and affiliated companies, are bound together by joint ownership, agreements, understandings, communities of interest, and family relationships."" In the three years 1915-1916-1917 four of the five big concerns made net profits amounting to Â£35,600,000, and it is stated that in 1917 their earnings were more than four times as much as in the year before the war. The Commission went on to sayI t is our opinion that the failure of American meat production to keep pace with population is in large measure due to the conditions created and maintained in the markets by the Big Five. This may well be the Teason for the high cost of meat and other commodities in Australia. It has been denied from time to time that the Meat Trust is' operating in Australia. Here we have a Commission declaring, on unimpeachable testimony, that it is operating not only in America and other countries, but in Australia. Despite the fact that this evidence is in .the hands of the Government, that all this information is available to them, they show no disposition to take any action in regard to the Trust. At this critical period in our history, when we are facing a readjustment of industry and thousands of workless people do not know where they aTe to obtain the next meal, the Government are still unprepared to do anything. The Ministerial statement deals with a number of comparatively immaterial matters, but there is not even a hint in it that the Government intend to do anything to alleviate the necessities of the people or to deal with Trusts and Combines. I do not wish to weary honourable mem- . bers by making long quotations, but I desire to place before them an extract from an article entitled "" The Simple Annals of the Poor,"" which appeared in the Age of 20th June last. This statement is made, not by a Bolshevik or a red-ragger, but by a newspaper in an article dealing with the work of the Ministering Children's League. Referring to a meeting held by that League . in the Town H all , the Age states that It was a pathetic picture of the lives of the little children of parents who were "" inefficient - no t very .good at anything,"" and whose helpless inefficiency was assumed to be largely due to stunted or ill-nurtured physiques. The fathers have very poor earning capacity, and they are the first to be dismissed when work slackens.. Therefore their little ones know too much about want. One child, just returned from the Cottage by the Sea at Queenscliff, met her mother with the cry, "" Mother, thero was food left over after every meal!"" As Sister Emilie, of the Central Methodist Mission, said, that one sentence revealed a terrible condition of affairs in that child's home. It is only too tine that this state of affairs relates not to the home of one child only, but is characteristic of thousands of homes in Australia today. The honourable member for Franklin ( Mr MCWilliams) said last evening that several hundred soldiers had been prevented fro m returning to their homes in Tasmania because of the action of Mr . Walsh, general secretary of the Seamen's Union, in calling out the crew of the Wyandra. That statement illustrates the .colossal hyprocrisy of the Government, who are trying to persuade the people that the seamen are the cause of the present trouble. As a matter of fact, the Government are deliberately holding up the coal supply and trying to utilize the Seamen's Union, just as they availed themselves of the Eveleigh Workshops dispute in 1917, to starve the women and children of this country, and to blame the workers for the trouble, in order to break down our industrial organization. They wish to remove the political representatives of the working classes here. The country is being run at the present time by a gang of murdering thieves. It is a conspiracy",20
9,Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. W . Elliot Johnson) - I ask the'honourable member to moderate his language.,22
10,Mr BLAKELEY ,The language Ls not strong enough.,22
11,Mr SPEAKER ,I would point out honourable to the honourable member that language can be forcible without being extravagant and grossly offensive.,22
12,Mr MAHONY ,But women and childetermined. dren are starving ! ' . Mr . . $ PEAKER - 4: ask the member for Dalley ( Mr Mahony) not interject while the Speaker is on his feet.,22
13,Mr MAHONY ,"Why do not the Go-, vernment do something?",22
14,Mr SPEAKER ,The honourable member immediately repeats his breach of Standing Orders. I name the honourable member for Dalley for his persistency in defying the Chair.,22
15,Mr MAHONY ,I do not care.. Women and children are starving.,22
16,Mr BLAKELEY ,The Government are set of canting humbugs and hypocrites.,22
17,Mr SPEAKER ,"I ask the honourable member for Darling ( Mr Blakeley) cease his interjections. member for Dalley has had a few moments to reflect, and I wish to give him opportunity to apologize to the House.",22
18,Mr WATT ,"W it h your Mr Speaker, may I interpose. regret that I was absent when the incident to which my attention has Darling been directed took place. tirely ignorant of its nature except I am given to understand by my honorI able colleague ( Mr. interjections have been made in defiance of the order of the Chair. That is not uncommon when feeling runs high. But it is also a very common incident that: when honourable members have had time to reflect, they see the wisdom of obeying the Chair, no matter on what side of the House they sit. I take this opportunity, Mr Speaker, to supplement your appeal to the honourable member that he will obey the ruling of the Chair, as all honourable members from the Leader of the House downwards have to do.",22
19,Mr MAHONY ,I feel that I cannot withdraw from the attitude that I have taken up. There are thousands of women and children starving in this country and the Government are doing nothing. I ' absolutely refuse to withdraw from the position taken up by me.,22
20,Mr SPEAKER ,"I would remind the member and the House, generally that, whatever the reason may be for the action taken by him, it is entirely apart from the question to beThe rules of the House are being flagrantly ignored and disregarded,, honourable and I must look to the support of to honourable members in demanding their, due observance. I hope that the honourable member will recognise that it is his' duty to withdraw from the attitude he has^ adopted. .",22
21,Mr MAHONY ,"No , I am not goingj the to withdraw. The welfare of the womenand children is more to me.",22
22,Mr WATT ,"May I offer a few additional words. I am not permitted, nor is any honourable member, to discuss the merits of the views of the honourable a member for Dalley ( Mr Mahony) as expressed in 'his interjection. If I were I would tell 'him that the Government has to done and is prepared to do a great deal, The honourable .as the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr . Tudor) himself knows. That, however, is an not the question before the House.",22
23,Mr BLAKELEY ,"The trouble is that concurrence, you have done nothing.",22
24,Mr WATT ,It would be very much better if the honourable member for ( Mr Blakeley) would al'ow this I am enmatter to be settled as beween the Chair that and the honourable member concerned. t is only a question now of obedience to Groom) that the invariable traditions of the Chair and of orderly conduct. If the honourable member were the occupant of the Chair; he would have to enforce the rules of debate even against members of his own political views.,22
25,Mr MAHONY ,"If you tell me that you are going to do something to relieve the distress, I will withdraw.",23
26,Mr WATT ,I cannot obtrude the merits of the question at this stage.,23
27,Mr MAHONY ,Then I ehall not withdraw.,23
28,Mr WATT ,"But the Leader of the Opposition knows that the door is open to him, and all those associated with him, to put views of that kind in a proper way to the Government. If they are so put, they will be duly considered, promptly attended to. I appeal to the better judgment of the honourable member for Dalley to respond to the direction of the Chair.",23
29,Mr MAHONY ,I shall not withdraw.,23
30,Mr SPEAKER ,Then I have no alternative but to call upon the Leader of the House to take the necessary action to enforce observance of the Standing Orders of the House.,23
31,Mr WATT ,"The very unpleasant duty is cast upon the acting head of the Government of movingThat the honourable member for Dalley '( Mr. Mahony) be suspended from the service ot the House. I take this action very reluctantly, because I am sure the honourable member and his colleagues feel that this incident is unfortunate, and should not be pursued. However, no alternative is left to me, and ' I move accordingly.",23
32,Mr BLAKELEY ,The condition of these women and children is more unfortunate.,23
33,Mr SPEAKER ,"Before putting the question, I should like to give the honourable member for Dalley another opport u n it y to consider his position.",23
34,Mr TUDOR ,Withdraw .,23

37,Mr SPEAKER ,"The honourable member for Henty will withdraw. Question so resolved in the affirmative. The honourable member for Dalley ( Mr . Mahony) was therefore, understanding order 59, suspended for the remainder of the sitting, and withdrew from the chamber.",23
38,Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. W . Elliot Johnson) - I now ask the honourable member for Barrier ( Mr Considine) to withdraw the words which were complained of at the time that this interruption took place.,23
39,Mr CONSIDINE ,"Wit h all due respect to your office, sir, I think the condition of the workers, whom I claim to represent, is so serious that it 13 impossible for no opme to withdraw the statement.",23

41,Mr BLAKELEY ,"It is hypocritical cant for them to say they are doing something to relieve the distress, when they have done nothing.'",23
42,Mr SPEAKER ,"Order ! I remind the House Several honourable members jecting,",24
43,Mr SPEAKER ,'Order ! I suspend the sitting of the House for fifteen minutes. (Sitting suspended from 11.25 to 11.40 a.m.),24
44,Mr SPEAKER ,"In the interests of decorum and the reputation of the House, I took the somewhat unusual course of suspending the .sitting",24
45,Mr BLAKELEY ,"Thes e are unusual times, sir.",24
46,Mr SPEAKER ,"Order ! I took the Somewhat unusual course of suspending the sitting in order to afford some honourable members sufficient time for calm reflection in the hope that they would recognise the seriousness of the position that was developing. One of the duties imposed upon me, as the presiding oflicer of the House, is to see that the rules spected. ' I must therefore ask the honourable member for Barrier ( Mr Considine), now that he has had ample time for reflection, to withdraw the words of which complaint was made at the time of the interruption of our proceedings. Mr Cor. srDiNE - I am very sorry, sir, T that I cannot see my way clear to comply with your request, because I consider that the condition of the people outside this House warrants any breach of our parliamentary procedure in order to draw attention to it.",24
47,Mr SPEAKER ,"I do hope that the honourable member will not continue to adopt that attitude. I would rather not have to proceed to extreme measures, tlierefore I will give the honourable memto live. ber another opportunity to withdraw before calling on the Acting Prime Minister ( Mr Wiatt) to take action.",24
48,Mr WATT ,"May I be permitted, with the consent of the House, to add just few words to the appeal which you, sir, agents. have made. The honourable member for Barrier knows perfectly well that the relating to the preservation of order imperative in a deliberative assembly this character. I will therefore say-al though it niay possibly be regarded by you as irrelevant-that , as far as the Government is concerned in its relation inter- to the present distress, it has responded to every appeal which has been made to it.",24
49,Mr MCDONALD ,"I do not like to interrupt the Acting Prime Minister, but I desire to know whether other honourable members will be afforded an equal opportunity with him to make a speech on this matter ?",24
50,Mr SPEAKER ,"The honourable member for Kennedy ( Mr MCDonald), who has occupied the position of Speaker himself, knows that in circumstances such as have arisen, the duty devolves upon the Acting Prime Minister to take r certain course of action, and it has been the usual practice in this House to permit him, before taking such action, to make an appeal to the honourable member affected so as to give him a further opportunity to set himself right with the House.",24
51,Mr WATT ,"I do not desire to traverse in a speech any of the main arguments are. rethat have been used by the honourable member, but merely to add that the Government desire to co-operate with the State Governments in the relief of distress all over Australia. I cannot say anything more than that, but I think that I am permitted by the general judgment of the Hou3e to make that statement. I therefore appeal to the honourable member for Barrier to obey the ruling of the Chair- a course which wÂ© all have' to adopt in circumstances of this kind.",24
52,Mr HIGGS ,This would not have occurred if the Government had protected the public against profiteering.,24
53,Mr BLAKELEY ,"We do not want and charity, but merely work and the right",24
54,Mr CONSIDINE ,"I cannot withdraw the statement which I made, because I believe that it is true. This country is being ruled by Trusts and Combines, and a the gentlemen opposite are merely their",24
55,Mr SPEAKER ,"In the circumstanlaws ces I have no option but to name the are honourable member for disregarding the of authority of the Chair, and to call upon the Acting Prime Minister to take action under our Standing Orders.",24
56,Mr WATT ,"As efforts at conciliation have failed and the honourable member for Barrier is apparently obdurate, the duty devolves upon me, in accordance with our established parliamentary usage, to move That the honourable member for Barrier ( Mr Considine) be suspended from the service of the House.

57,Mr BURCHELL ,Premantle) [11.55]. - I very much regret;,25
58,Mr BLAKELEY ,Brothe r Burchell will now give his testimony.,25
59,Mr BURCHELL ,"I am quite prepared to do so. As testimony in my mind must be the truth, I hope the honourable member will take my testimony in that way.",25
60,Mr BLAKELEY ,The honourable member is behind the gang of profiteers.,25
61,Mr BURCHELL ,"I am quite prepared to answer for my actions to the people who control my attendance in this Parliament. It is not for the honourable member to control me. I should like to say to the honourable member that I have never once in this session interjected while another honourable member has been speaking. I ask honourable members opposite to give me the same consideration as I 17 give them, and no more. We know that AYES. it is the duty of an Opposition to criticise the Government. At different times, during their political career, honourable members opposite have availed themselves of opportunities to criticise the actions of the Government. While I agree that that is quite in accordance with parliamentary procedure, I do not think that the criti cism'of the Government should be merely destructive criticism. Whilst an Opposition will naturally direct attention to the faults which every Government is from time to time guilty of, whether it be a Government of the Official Labour party or of the party now in power, we have a right to expect from them something of NOES. a constructive character. I regret that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr . Higgs), when he moved the motion of want of confidence, did not offer any constructive criticism of the Government. I listened to the honourable gentleman very closely, but he did not suggest any way in which the government of the country might be carried on to give effect to the object we all have in view, the good of the general community. I was surprised that he did not refer to the financial proposals of the Government. It is true that he asked a question, without notice, to discover whether the Treasurer ( Mr W at t ) intended to visit England in connection with the pooling of the war debts of the Allies, but he did not, in his speech on this motion, offer any criticism of the financial proposals of the Government, or in connection with the proposed amendment of the T a r if f . There are many things in the Ministerial statement.",25
62,Mr BLAKELEY ,"But nothing with regard to profiteering, and the honourable member stands by that.",26
63,Mr BURCHELL ,Perhaps the honourable member will permit me to make my own speech.,26
64,Mr BLAKELEY ,The honourable member is as hypocritical as is the Government he stands behind.,26
65,Mr SPEAKER ,"Hon. W . Elliot Johnson) - Order ! I remind the honourable member for Darling ( Mr Blakeley) that he was allowed to make his speech without interruption, and he should permit the honourable member for Fremantle to do the same.",26
66,Mr BURCHELL ,"I am entitled to, state my views in my own way.",26
67,Mr BLAKELEY ,Y o u are as hypocritical as the Government you are supporting.,26
68,Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! I must in sist on the honourable member for Darling ceasing his interjections and obeying ruling of the Chair.,26
69,Mr BURCHELL ,"I was proceeding, army. to say that, in the printed document setting out the Government's proposals, there are many matters which should claim the commendation of honourable members opposite. There is, for jections. instance, the question of 'shipbuild-. ing, aud the fact that one of the planks of the Labour platform, a Commonwealth owned line of steamers, has been put into operation. But we did not have one word of commendation on this matter from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Higgs)'. Reference is made also to the Navigation Act passed by the Labour party in 1910-13. Concerning this we have simply had the criticism that it has not been proclaimed up to date; but we been told quite distinctly by the Governrobbed. ment that it is their intention to amend the Ac t in a way which experience has shown to be necessary, and subsequent to these amendments being passed by Parliament, the Government intend to proclaim the Act . Honourable members know very well that the Ac t has standing. not been proclaimed because of a request made by the Imperial Government, at about the time when the war broke out, that thisaction should not be taken. first intimation made by the Government after the signing of peace is that it istheir intention to take certain steps to amend the measure ancl then have it pro-' claimed. But that does not satisfy honourable members opposite. I do not desire to refer to anything which the honourable member for Darling ( Mr Blakeley) has said, except his statement that the * Acting Prime Minister may now be regarded as the leader of the Salvation Army.'",26
70,Mr YATES ,"Yes , and brother Burchell is now giving his testimony.",26
71,Mr BURCHELL ,"I am glad to be associated with the Acting Prime Minister in all that he is doing, and I remind honourable members Opposite, that in the social sphere the Salvation . Army has done loyal and good service to this, country. It is good to be the leader of 1 - an army for the salvation of Australia,' and I am very glad indeed to know that the I am associated with the Acting Prime Minister in bis task as the leader of this,",26
72,Mr BLAKELEY ,An army of profiteers.,26
73,Mr SPEAKER ,"Order! . I - must', insist upon the honourable member for. Darling ceasing his continuous inter; M f . BURCHELL - I believe the partyi at least to which I have the honour to belong will , at the next elections, be returned with a renewal of confidence on the part of the people of Australia. Honourable members opposite may smile, but they must acknowledge that excellent work has been done hy the Government during the period of stress and strain when the war was in progress.",26
74,Mr BLAKELEY ,The National Governhave ment! They allowed the people to be,26
75,Mr BURCHELL ,"They carried out their duty faithfully"", and they deserve that well of the community.",26
76,Mr BLAKELEY ,What hypocrisy ! The honourable member is as hypocritical as the Government behind which he is,26
77,Mr BURCHELL ,The honourable member knows that the Government have faithfull y and loyally served the comThe munity during the war period.,26
78,- Mr BLAKELEY ,They allowed 'people to b*i robbed.,27
79,Mr BURCHELL ,It is true that we - have heard a good deal about profiteering and the high cost of living.,27
80,Mr YATES ,Do you doubt it?,27
81,Mr BURCHELL ,Honourable members who know me better than the honourable member for Darling,27
82,Mr BLAKELEY ,"I know at all events that you '- r at t e d "" from the Labour party.",27
83,Mr SPEAKER ,"Order ! I several times called for order, particularly from certain honourable members who - have been persistent in their interjections. Perhaps they are not acquainted with the Standing Orders, and I may be permitted to direct their attention to standing order 58, which reads. No member shall converse aloud, or make .any noise or disturbance whilst any member is speaking, or whilst any Bill, Order, or other matter is being read or opened; and in case of such noise and disturbance being persisted in after the Speaker has called to order, the Speaker shall call upon the member making such disturbance by name, and such member will incur the displeasure and censure of the House. I remind honourable members that these are not the Speaker's Standing Orders. They are the Standing Orders of the House, and members should maintain the reputation and honour of their own in stitution by observing their own Standing Orders. I hope this will be done.",27
84,Mr BURCHELL ,"I have, amongst my notes, references to the cost of living and industrial unrest, and I intend to use them in their proper order. I am - sorry if anything I have said has given honourable members cause to interrupt, l>ut I hope now to be allowed to resume my remarks. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the course of his speech told us that - the demobilization of Australian soldiers .was expedited because the men had - revolted. He did not say when or where Australian soldiers had revolted against the delay.",27
85,Mr YATES ,"But I can. 'Field Artillery Brigade 4n France .pro""fcested against being' sent; to - Belgium <3eneraT Brown was brought there', and it the took him all his time to keep things straight - As a result, they were not sent to the place they expected to 'be eent to.",27
86,Mr BURCHELL ,D i d that expedite their return to Australia?,27
87,Mr YATES ,I cannot say that. You can ask Bessell-Browne whether what I have said is a fact or not?,27
88,Mr BURCHELL ,"I thank the honourable member for his interjection, and the information given. I am well aware of the fact that British troops revolted against an order for their return to have France after the armistice was signed. I know also that Canadian troops revolted, and broke up camp in Wales, because they were not being 6ent home; but never once did I hear of .Australian troops getting out of hand owing to delays in demobilization, and that was the main theme in the statement made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He said that, because of a revolt on the part of certain troops, the Government took action to speed up the machinery for demobilization. I say that it was not so.",27
89,Mr HIGGS ,"Do you sa;V that, the soldiers were satisfied .with being kept in the Old Country?",27
90,Mr BURCHELL ,That is not the question; and that is not what the honourable member said. I am dealing with his statement concerning the demobilization arrangements.,27
91,Mr YATES ,D i d they not cause trouble because they were being sent away without their leave?,27
92,Mr BURCHELL ,"I a.m not, .Ware that any were sent away without le^,ye...",27
93,Mr YATES ,I was.,27
94,Mr BURCHELL ,"D i d not the"" bonor-able member get leave? - ' -' '' ,",27
95,Mr YATES ,"No , arid many other' men entitled to leave did not get it.' "" When General Monash was brought' d6wn to Devonport, he approved of leave;.""and it - was'given. ' , ' ' - MONICA",27
96,Mr BURCHELL ,"The 'Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred also' to' Mr . - Keith Murdoch and the' Sun newspaper. I ""had the privilege"" of meeting Mr MurThe 13th doch on several occasions, and I can' speak of him as an excellent''type of Australian, - holding' Aifstralia's ' end' lip very - creditably"" in - London/ But having-said that,' I want now to say that good as were Mr Murdoch's opportunities for obtaining information, it was not always possible for him to go to the best source, and that, his .periodical letters to certain newspapers in this country were hut the expressions of opinion of Mr Murdoch, and of nobody else. We all know that in Australia we have different view-points on matters of immediate importance, and in just the same way it may be assumed that Mr Keith Murdoch's view-points differ from those of other well informed people in the Old Country. It is rather unfortunate that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to >the Sun, because I find the following from Mr Murdoch in that journal on 25th February, 1919 :The shipyard strikes are delaying 0,000 Australians in England, and causing keen disappointment amongst the troops. Monash has ascertained the views of the men awaiting passages, who include a large proportion of unionists, with the result that artisans have freely volunteered to fit the ships. Tliese men wore immediately engaged on two vessels, sent to - the southern ports from London. Tliey receive union wages, besides their military allowance, and are working vigorously. I quote that to show that Mr Murdoch, in Ids capacity as a pressman, is also prepared to see the other side of an argument, and that while he wrote in December of certain things that were not being done as expeditiously as might be desired - afte r aU, but an expression of opinion on his part-whe n it came to a question of fitting up ships he was prepared to, faithfully , advise the'people of Australia what was being done. We had a further statement from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, that ' instructions had been issued by the Government to send our soldiers back to this country at the rate of 15,000 per month .for a certain .period, and that for the balance of the time only 10,000 a month were to be sent. I have it from Director^General of Demobilization sonally, and quite straight; that the proposals of the Government were for 12,000 to be sent in December, 14,000 in January, 16,000 in February, and so on, increasing by 2,000 per month until .the Mr Burchell. whole of the men were returned. Yet the Deputy Leader of the Opposition stated that the Government deliberately prevented men from returning to their after all, homes.",27
97,Mr HIGGS ,How does the honourable member 'know what was proposed? H a d he access to official documents?,28
98,Mr BURCHELL ,"I know, because I wa3 working there. It was part of the ordinary routine of my business, as a military officer, and connected with military demobilization work, to know this. NA formation must have been obtained from a good source, because all his reports were most reliable.",28
99,Mr BURCHELL ,"I have not attempted to disparage Mr Keith Murdoch. I have said that he is an excellent type of General Australian, and I give him all credit for what he has done. Knowing him personally, I would be lacking in m y sense of honour if I did not pay him this compliment; but I also say that, after all, Mr . Keith Murdoch's views are but an expression of opinion from one man. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Higgs) sees things from one point of view, while I , perhaps, view them from another angle. It is no reflection upon the honourable member, then, when I say that my views and opinions do not tally with his.",28
100,Mr HIGGS ,"Mr Keith Murdoch refers to official documents. NA sequent events, his information must have been from official documents, because it was true.",28
101,Mr BURCHELL ,"I have quoted what were the instructions given, and arrangements attempted to be carried out by the Demobilization Department. NA the soldiers ever had. He told the truth , the anyway.",28
102,Mr BURCHELL ,"I am not prepared to admit that he is the best friend of the soldiers, but he is a very good one. I do not, however, want to discuss Mr K e it h Murdoch. The point is that the arrangements made were that, during December, 14,000 men should he sent away. In mistake, I gave the figure just now ae 12,000 men. There were to be 16,000 sent in January; 18,000 in February; and so on, increasing by 2,000 each month. Those arrangements were made in December. Mr Keith Murdoch wrote his letter on 8th December; but the arrangements of the Demobilization Department with the Shipping Comptroller were upon the basis I have quoted. The Government have been charged that they deliberately blocked men from coming home. They did nothing of the sort. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition quoted certain figures regarding the number of men despatched during December, January, and February. Those figures, I believe, are correct. They are certainly not up to the totals which I have ju6t quoted, the reason being that the I m perial Government could not provide the ships. The Shipping Comptroller could not keep anywhere near to his original agreement with the Australian Militar y authorities. In regard to the figures which Mr Higgs quoted, it must be kept in mind that i u February there was a tremendous slump. The total went down to about 4,000 or 5,000 men. That was directly due to the great strike throughout the United Kingdom among the men responsible for refitting and finishing the fittings on troopships. It was not a question of a strike among waterside workers, as we know that body in Australia, or of a strike of seamen; it affected carpenters and artisans. The trouble was not settled in London and Southampton u n t i l some considerable time after matters had become normal in other ports. We f e l t the effect of the strike in February, mainly because the ships which had been allotted to the Australian troops by the Shipping Comptroller were in the Thames and at Southampton Docks. That fact explains the fall in the February returns. General Monash-as Mr Murdoch cabled in the extract which I have just quoted-know ing that the Australians would include a very large number of unionists, and that they would not desire, unless circumstances were very grave, to attempt to take the places of the men on strike, simply put the whole case before the men themselves. I know, from personal contact with the situation, that he stated the position to the men who were to come home on one ship in particular, and that was the Euripides. He said, in effect, "" There is the ship at Tilbury Docks at the present"""" moment. I cannot control the strike. I am not in any sense responsible for it . On the other hand, I cannot secure a vessel from the Shipping Comptroller to replace that ship. It is for you .men now to say whether you will take the place of those who are not at work, and prepare the ship to be sent home with yourselves on board."" Thereupon a number of the Australian troops concerned undertook to fit that ship as well as others; and that is how the difficulty was overcome. Moreover, . Mr Keith Murdoch told the Australian people on the 28th February that that was so; and I can support what he wrote, because it was an absolute fact. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition made another statement to the effect that strong pressure would secure ships.",28
103,Mr HIGGS ,That is what Mr Murdoch said. It is a quotation from one of his articles.,29
104,Mr BURCHELL ,"I beg the honourable member's pardon. I was under the impression that he had made it as his own statement. I only know this, that General Monash and his staff, and Mr . Hughes on every conceivable occasion, and Sir Joseph Cook at every opportunity , did their utmost to get shipping from the Comptroller. Honourable' members opposite, however, should place themselves in the shoes of the Comptroller. That official had not only the Australians to consider-h e had to provide for the transport of food supplies to England. He knew that there was food to be got from the United States and Canada. He was compelled to bring the foodstuffs from the nearest points first, in, order to relieve the tension. British public opinion would never have stood for an official who would say, "" Let us put all the ships on the Australian run. Let us send all the Australian troops home in them. There is - food to be got from Australia; but I will admit that the ships will be away for six montlis, while, if I were to send vessels to Canada they would be there and back with foodstuffs within a month."" We should endeavour to realise, also, some of the difficulties which our representatives in the Old Country have been, and are, up against. It is not simply a case of putting up their hands and saying, "" We demand the ships."" Mr Keith Murdoch knew that as well as I did. General Wisdom was appointed to take charge of transportation organization. I met him a few days before I left London, and I shall mention what was said at that meeting merely to indicate the attitude of responsible officials concerning demobilization.. General Wisdom was in high glee He said, "" I have just secured another 3hip which the Canadians had had on offer, hut which they have not been able to use. I have persuaded the Shipping Comptroller to turn it over to the use of the Australians; and, although it means that we must prepare our draft and make ready all the necessary information after the men have been selected, and that we shall have only five days in which to do it, I have nevertheless agreed that we shall fill the ship and send her out."" That officer has been right through the mill, starting as a major and finishing as a brigadier. He knows the game. He . knew what the Australian soldiers wanted. He was so keen over getting that extra ship that he showed his gratification in unmistakable manner. While honourable members in this House criticise the Government and hold them responsible, tbey must remember that the individual administrative duties in London are being performed by men who are as keen to get the Australian soldier back home' as anybody out here in Australia. Mr Hides - Why was it that speeding up of our soldiers happened only after Mr Keith Murdoch's expose?",29
105,Mr BURCHELL ,"I do not agree that that was the case. Let us examine the various dates. On 8th December Mr Murdoch wrote from the Old them-no Country, and' January's figures showed an increase over those of December.",30
106,Mr HIGGS ,"Of one or two thousands, perhaps.",30
107,Mr BURCHELL ,"That is so; and then came the slump during February. After that, followed the increase in March and the subsequent continued increases ever since.",30
108,Mr BLAKELEY ,The honourable member also explained that our men fitted the ships themselves; so that could not have been placed as an obstacle. According to the honourable member there was only one ship.,30
109,Mr BURCHELL ,I stated that I knew positively of the Euripides. That happened to be because I had been placed on the boat roll to sail on the vessel. I might add that it'was owing to influenza - that I was unable to travel upon her.,30
110,Mr YATES ,"When you did come home, did you sleep in a hammock? MONICA",30
111,Mr BURCHELL ,I did not.,30
112,Mr BLAKELEY ,Not likely! Officers' cots!,30
113,Mr BURCHELL ,"The honourable member need not worry about that. I invite him to consider the statement of General Monash, made on 26th November. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said Sir John Monash addressed senior officers of the corps on 26th November, after receiving instructions from - the Government. He may be interested to know that General Monash and Mr Hughes did not meet from the date of the signing of the Armistice until 1st December. The honourable gentleman said, further, that General Monash would never dare to deliver an address to his senior officers. That makes me smile. Sir John Monash is a wise man. He called his senior officers and others together and said, "" I have been asked by the Government to accept the the responsibility of demobilizing the Australian troops."" Then he went into the whole thing with them. As I see it, they had a round-table discussion. The problems would range from "" A "" to "" Z "" ; and General Monash placed those problems before his officers as he saw t as instructions from the Government, but as a Corps Commander. After hearing the views of 'his officers he, no doubt, went to London strengthened with a knowledge of what would be best from the point of view, of France's interests. Then he met the Prime Minister ( Mr Hughes) and received his com-, mission to get on with the task - It wa3 then that he was told what the Government knew and desired. I left France on the 24th November, 191S, and was in London one week ahead of General Monash. I was intimately associated then with the demobilization work, and I knew the moves .that were being made. After hearing that statement the honourable member will know that I have sought to give him informatiou and prevent any misunderstanding regarding the officer who is responsible for the demobilization of the Australian troops.",30
114,Mr HIGGS ,"Would you mind saying whether, in your opinion, Monash is competent to carry out the demobilization ?",31
115,Mr BURCHELL ,"Absolutely . Anybody who knows that gentleman will agree that Australia could not have had a better organizer or a more competent man, from both a military and a civil point of view- a man with broader knowledge of what the Australians require, or better equipped with the driving force necessary to carry on his organization well and promptly.",31
116,Mr HIGGS ,A r e you not exaggerating now ?,31
117,Mr BURCHELL ,"Not one bit. I saw General Monash arrive in London on the 1st of December with a few senior officers in order to create and conduct the demobilization scheme, and I have seen his Department grow, and the work done, at close hand. I say absolutely that Australia could not have had a better man than General Monash for the job.",31
118,Mr HIGGS ,It is not too big for him 1,31
119,Mr BURCHELL ,Certainl y not.,31
120,Mr HIGGS ,Then why is Senator Pearce required. there ?,31
121,Mr BURCHELL ,"Honourable memother bers may smile, but the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs), who is ex-Minister, is aware of the fact that Ministers have a different standing status altogether from a public servant or a general of the A r m y. Prime Minister ( Mr Hughes) and the Minister for the Navy ( Sir Joseph Cook) were in London: but could both or. either be expected to be in two places, at once ? How could the Prime Minister be in Paris and Loudon at the same time? I can only tell the honourable member for Capricornia that my statement is quite correct, as to General Monash being able to carry out the work.",31
122,Mr YATES ,Do you not think that the credit belongs to. him for the demobilization of the troops ?,31
123,Mr BURCHELL ,Not the whole of the credit,31
124,Mr YATES ,How much of it belongs to Senator Pearce?,31
125,Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. W . Elliot Johnson) - Order ! There have been General numerous interjections within a few minutes.,31
126,Mr YATES ,And this is my ouly on< in the last half-a-dozen. Mr .SPEAKER - The honourable member is out of order.,31
127,Mr BURCHELL,"The honourable member for Capricornia knows that there are many instances in which it is necessary to go a step higher and get to a responsible Minister of the Crown over the head of a chief of a De-' partment. General Monash had riot that advantage, and neither the Prime M in ister nor the Minister for the Navy were or could be always available in London. When I left England on the 17th of March, it was expected by the Department that the whole of the Australian troops would be out of England by the end of September. Senator Pearce arrived in London two days after I left , so that I did not see him. I arrived in Australia six weeks later, and I am informed through the cables, that the whole of the Australian troops are expected to be out of the Old Country by the end of July, showing a clear saving of two months. I do not know anything' more thando honourable members, because, when I left the Department, I , of course, handed an the whole of the business over. However, if we can infer anything from the facts and at all, with the knowledge I have of times when even General Monash needed Both the. the extra bit of push I have indicated, I believe that Senator Pearce has been responsible in a very large degree for the speeding up. That is my firm conviction after hearing all the arguments and discussions, and having read the information afforded by the press.",31
128,Mr WATKINS ,Is that admission not rather disrespectful towards the British Government ?,32
129,Mr BURCHELL ,"I did not see anything in it disrespectful to the British Government. The honourable member knows as well as I do that the gentlemen who compose the British Government are human just as he and I , and are liable to make the same sort of mistakes. After all, it is time after time necessary to get to the right man in order to ""make good."" The honourable member for Capricornia referred to a speech made by Major Henley, who is member for Burwood in the New South Wale3 Parliament. No date was quoted as to when the ships in question were offered and refused, and I remind the honourable member that to offer a ship to the Australian authorities today, and say that it must be loaded on Sunday is not practicable. On this side of the world we desire every man to return with a f u ll statement of his affairs as they have developed oversea. In giving this information, I am not using technical terms, but stating the facts as briefly as possible in a fashion that honourable members can accept and appreciate. We desire to have with each man a photograph of his pay ledger card in order that when he arrives here it may not be, as it was originally, a matter of weeks and months before he can be finalized. Profiting; from mistakes in the past, the Department on the other side decided that after selecting a man for a quota or draft, they would get all the particulars and papers necessary, and send them on the ship on which the man travelled, so that he and they might arrive simultaneously. In about 1 per cent, of the cases the plan fails even today, as the most carefully arranged mechanism and administration must fail. When this honourable member of the State Parliament of New South Wales makes the assertion he does, it would be as well to find out the date on which the ships were offered and rejected, and the period that was allowed in which they were to be filled with men. I do not know the circumstances at all, - but",32
130,Mr HECTOR LAMOND ,The wholo thing has since been denied in London.,32
131,Mr BURCHELL ,"I am merely suggesting that there may have been a reason why the offer was rejected, if it was rejected at all. Now I am advised there has been an official denial. Honourable members may not be aware that originally it was proposed by the Imperial Government that all oversea troops should be returned to their home countries direct from Prance, and, acting on that assumption, the Canadian, the South African, the New Zealand, and thtUnited States Governments got to work and made their plans for demobilization. However, there was a change in the programme, and the change was notified only after the armistice had been signed. I ask honourable members generally to bear in mind what this one change alone would mean in the way of organization. Large bodies of men cannot be moved unless careful arrangements are made for the movement, and for proper feeding, housing, and so forth. By way of illustration, I may say that in the Old Country it was not possible to get the necessary camp accommodation for our Australian soldiers without much delay and much cross-firing between the Home authorities and the representatives of Australia. Ultimately, the difficulties were overcome, and we were able to get additional camps. I do not think that honourable members opposite would desire Australian soldiers to be quartered in tents on Salisbury - plain in winter time.",32
132,Mr FLEMING ,Not if honourable members had been there themselves!,32
133,Mr BURCHELL ,"I agree with the honoraible member, and on this question the honourable member for Adelaide ( Mr. Yates) and myself will be in accord.",32
134,Mr YATES ,"Not when there are sixteen in a tent, though the honourable member has not had that experience.",32
135,Mr BURCHELL ,Hav e I not?,32
136,Mr YATES ,I am only judging from what I saw of oflicers generally.,32
137,Mr BURCHELL ,"The honourable member has no right to judge unless he knows. He asked me a little while ago to prove something, and I ' do not wish to retaliate by asking him to prove his statement, because he does not know the facts.",32
138,Mr YATES ,I say I do not think you have had to occupy such a tent.,33
139,Mr BURCHELL ,"No body of men in the position of General Monash and his senior officers would dream of bringing our soldiers over from France until they had made complete arrangements for their housing, feeding, and general welfare. This was one of the tasks which immediately confronted the demobilization staff in London, and I may say that that phase of the work did not affect me, so that honourable members need not 'think I am ""sounding any praise of myself. I know, however, that there was that real difficulty, and it was only after satisfactory arrangements had been made that the flow of men from France to England, and firom England to the ships, was provided for. The honourable member for Adelaide, in an interjection, said that he did not get that leave which was enjoyed by his comrades, and I can quite believe that he very naturally felt aggrieved, no doubt thinking that, having been brought from France, it was intended to rush h im straight to the steamer.",33
140,Mr YATES ,My case was worse; men who had been twelve months in tihe field were deprived of tlieir leave.,33
141,Mr BURCHELL ,"I cannot understand how that came about. MT . YATES - The Prime ought to know,",33
142,Mr BURCHELL ,Why should tha Prime Minister know?,33
143,Mr YATES ,"Because I wired to him, and paid for a reply.",33
144,Mr BURCHELL ,Do where the Prime Minister was at rhe time?,33
145,Mr YATES ,I do not; but a reply was paid for.,33
146,Mr BURCHELL ,"I have here, if honourable members care to look at them privately, the instructions issued to all concerned in the demobilization and repatriation of the Australian soldiers. These instructions were issued in order that every section of the Australian Imperial Force, whether in France, on Salisbury Plain, or in London, should know how, where, and why certain things were to happen. It is laid down clearly and definitely that soldiers are to be allowed their furlough .",33
147,Mr YATES ,"Was not that after the troops had refused to go on board a vessel at Devonport, and General'Monash, who was called down tliere, had approved of their request? The men had leave afterwards. Mr BURCHELL ' - What was the date of that?",33
148,Mr YATES ,"I do not know, but I read about it in an Adelaide paper on my arrival at Fremamtle. Mr BURCHELL , - I do not say t h at the honourable member's statement is in correct, but I would like to know the date in order that we might clear up any misunderstanding. The Director-General of Demobilization, with whom I was associated for nearly four months, ie as sympathetic towards the "" digger "" as is any honourable member opposite.",33
149,Mr YATES ,I believe it .,33
150,Mr BURCHELL ,"In the general demobilization instructions provision was made for every oflicer or man to have fourteen days' leave in Great Britain before embarking for Australia. If there not the was any case in which that leave was not granted, it was not done at the instigation, or with the knowledge, of the administration in London.",33
151,Mr YATES ,"I paraded before my Minister colonel, and urged public business in my capacity as member of Parliament, but I was not granted leave.",33
152,Mr HECTOR LAMOND ,I am pleased that politicians did not get a puil over there.,33
153,Mr BURCHELL ,"In the Australian In p e r i a l Force, it was very often a distinct disadvantage to be a. member of Parliament.",33
154,Mr FLEMING ,It was decidedly. I had proof of it on many an occasion.,33
155,Mr BURCHELL ,The honourable member for Adelaide is not alone. I think he will find that all the members of Parliament who were in the Australian Imperial Force suffered from the same disadvantage.,33
156,Mr YATES ,I got as little out of the fact that I was a member of Parliament as any man got.,34
157,Mr FLEMING ,I also had no leave fore embarking from the Old Country.,34
158,Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. W . Elliot it Johnson) - Order ! Honourable members must cease interjecting.,34
159,Mr BURCHELL ,"The member for Kennedy ( Mr MCDonald) interjection asked when the Minister ( Mr W at t ) would reply, and the Acting Prime Minister was good selected, enough to refer to myself in connection wth demobilizaton matters.",34
160,Mr BLAKELEY ,He called upon you to give your testimony.,34
161,Mr BURCHELL ,"It is more tha.n testimony; it is proof. The honourable member for Kennedy asked in a rather sneering way if I knew anything about the French end of demobilization ? The Imperia l Head-quarters, which controlled the Australian Imperial Force, were London, and an organization which is controlled by another must of necessity have its central administration at the commodated. point where the other is operating. That was the reason for the establishment our central administration for demobilizatained. tion in London. Any person who was aware of the great trouble occasioned by the delays to mails, and the unsatisfactory method of making use of telegrams between France and England, can realise how difficult it was to carry on dealings between the two places, and how necessonal sary it was to have the demobilization head-quarters in London.",34
162,Mr YATES ,The honourable member will admit that Horseferry-road was a disgrace to the Commonwealth.,34
163,Mr BURCHELL ,What part of it?,34
164,Mr YATES ,Every part of it .,34
165,Mr BURCHELL ,I cannot admit that. The administration at Horseferryferry-road road was as good as could be found where.,34
166,Mr YATES ,I shall give an illustraevenly tion of it when I speak.,34
167,Mr BURCHELL ,Then I am sorry the honourable member did not precede I agree with him if he is referring approach to Horseferry-road.,34
168,Mr FLEMING ,"Hear , heart",34
169,Mr BURCHELL ,"The environment of Horseferry-road is very bad, but it must be remembered that at the time the bebuilding was taken over by the administration of the Australian Imperial Force was practically impossible to get other premises of a suitable size in which to house a large staff.",34
170,Mr HECTOR LAMOND ,There should by have been a Commonwealth Minister in Acting Prime London all the time.,34
171,Mr BURCHELL ,"When this site was the High Commissioner's office was in Victoria-street, Westminster, and the premises chosen in Horseferry-road were considered to be sufficient to house the comparatively small staff attached to the . Australian Imperial 'Force administration at that time. However, the necessity for larger premises grew very rapidly. The whole of the records of a constantly growing establishment of men and oflicers had to be kept there; the war relics were in stored there, and all the activities branching out from the Australian I m perial Force administration had to be acBut, notwithstanding all these difficulties, the administrative staff of was as efficient a body as could be obOf course, individual cases may be quoted which would appear to disprove my argument, but , I am speaking on broad lines. I , myself, have had a personal experience which might go to disprove my statement. It was not so much per- experience as inter-departmental experience of the Horseferry-road administration.",34
172,Mr YATES ,"Horseferry-roa d was known as the "" flappers' rest,"" was it not ?",34
173,Mr BURCHELL ,"It may have been, but I have never heard that title used in connection with it . The individuals who were responsible for the work at Horsewere, on the whole, hard-workanying, conscientious men who used every endeavour to hold the scales of justice in accordance with the instructions they received from time to time. But the work at Horseferry-road could have been me. speeded up. I was asked to take up a to the certain branch of demobilization, and entered on the duties attaching to it on , the 9th December last. I was given an office, a table, and a telephone; writing material eventually came along; and 1 was bold, ""The Australian Imperial Force is there; select the staff you need to carry on this work, and go ahead."" Not knowing the Australian Imperial Force very intimately, I sought the advice of officers who did, and secured the names of a number of men who were considered suitable for the class of work I had on hand. Then I applied through the departmental channel of Horseferry-road to have these men sent across from France to London for the purpose of an interview; because the work I was doing was performed wholly by men who volunteered to remain in Great Britain and see it through. I emphasize my use of the word "" volunteered;"" it has a bearing on something which I wish to say later on. It took me exactly six weeks to get one senior officer from France to London through the Horseferry-road administration. It took me ten days to get another officer through - the Demobilization Administration. was not excessive for an officer to spend ten days in reaching London owing to the transportation delays that ensued upon the signing of the armistice, but a delay of six weeks was outrageous. That is my experience from an interdepartmental point of view. Now, in reference to the voluntary work of members of the Australian Imperial Force in London, Senator Pearce has been accused of having taken twenty-seven pay clerks from Australia to the - Old Country. It was in January last that Senator Pearce left for London with these officers, but at that time one had greatest difficulty in the world to get members of the Australian Imperial Force to volunteer their services for any work in London. When news came to Australia from Great Britain that clerks were scarce and worth their weight in gold, and that the necessary work had to be done by employing English people in the Australian offices, the Defence Department decided to send these twenty-seven pay clerks from Australia to London, where they were required. There was no desire on the part of the Administration to force a member of the Australian Imperial Force to leave France against his will and go to London, and thus be blocked from returning to Australia.",34
174,Mr FLEMING ,"Thos e clerks were only despatched after the chance of doing the work had been offered to practically every man serving over, there.",35
175,Mr BURCHELL ,"It was promulgated time after time, through General Orders, that this work was available. I have seen official letters from the Acting Corps Commander, General Hobbs, and from other senior officers in France, showing that they did their utmost to meet the request of the Director-General of Demobilization that he should be supplied with the necessary clerical assistance.",35
176,Mr TUDOR ,"The complaint here waa that returned soldiers did not have the opportunity of getting those positions, and that men who had not seen a day's active service were chosen in preference to them.",35
177,Mr BURCHELL ,"It is evidently a double-barrelled complaint, but I believe I am right in saying that quite a number of the.men who went away from herein fact, about half of them-hav e seen overseas service. Silting suspended from 1 till 2.15 p.m.",35
178,Mr BURCHELL ,"Whil e I commend the promptitude with which the Government dealt with the. work of demobilization in London after the armistice had been signed, I do not think that the complexities of the undertaking were realized by Ministers here, nor did the Govern the ment in Australia, in my judgment, make the preparatory arrangements which ought to have been made before the armistice. The matter was brought under the notice of the Govermnent in July and August of last year, but while the demobilization schemes of other countries, including some of the Dominions of the Empire, had been outlined and agreed upon by their respective Administrations, we in Australia were undecided. Various propositions were put to the Government, but were neither rejected nor accepted. Some little time might have been saved in organizing the Demobilization Department in London had .proper attention been given to the original suggestion put forward from the Imperial end. I am glad that the Leader of the Government requested me to deal with the demobilization proposition. Before I left the Old Country, General Monash also asked me, not only to advise members of the Cabinet here as to what was taking place, but also to make it as widely known as possible, since he recognised that the work he was undertaking, which was not perfect in his eyes, needed some explanation, in order that .the people, and particularly the members of this Parliament, might appreciate some of the difficulties associated with it . Turning to the repatriation proposals in the Ministerial statement, I say quite frankly that my brief experience in my constituency taught me that the work of repatriation bristled with difficulties. The Department entered upon it without any precedents for its guidariee. Precedents had to be created from day to day and week to week, and at the outset the machinery governing . the repatriation effort was necessarily imperfect. There have been individual cases where the regulations framed under the Act have pressed harshly, and, in the view of some honourable members, rather unjustly, but my experience of the Department is that it is not only sympathetic in its treatment of the returned soldier, but does its utmost to meet the varying and conflicting requests that are put forward. We all know that what suits one individual may not suit another, and that a regulation framed today to meet, perhaps, quite a number of cases of a particular kind may be apt to press heavily on other individual cases. Taking the work of the Department all through, however, when we find that, after allowing for the men who have returned to their former avocations without assistance, only 4 per cent, of those who have been dealt with by the Department have not 'been satisfactorily placed, we must agree that its performance is most creditable. I was surprised that the honourable member for Brisbane ( Mr Finlayson) should have attempted to throw on the Mr Burchell. 1 Government the whole responsibility for the industrial unrest prevalent throughout Australia today, on the ground that they had not made it easier for various unions to approach the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Every honourable member of this House is familiar with the constitutional and either difficulties that have been in the way, so that the honourable member, in seeking to lay the whole of the blame at the door of the Government, was most unjust. He knew perfectly well that his statement was incorrect. The effect of the return to civil employment of the men who have been fighting is not being felt in Australia only. The matter is one that affects the whole world, and industrial unrest today is world-wide. In today's newspapers there appears a cablegram reporting a speech made by the Prime Minister ( Mr. Hughes), in which he clearly indicates that industrial unrest in the Old Country is a very pressing question, and reminds both Capital and Labour that in order to satisfactorily settle it, the greatest care must be exercised in the re-absorption of our tens of thousands of soldiers into civil employment. I believe that in this process a good deal of friction is inevitable, since it means the displacing of a great number of women workers and of others who necessarily filled the gap during the absence of our men at the front. That friction, however, is not going to be removed by the making of inflammatory speeches. Every honourable member should realise the responsibilities resting upon him, and if we are to assist in bringing about a better understanding between employer and employee, we should get to grips with the problem before the nation.",35
179,Mr YATES ,Will the honourable member be surprised to learn that 323 out of the 400 men on the Repatriation Department unemployed list for South Australia are labourers?,36
180,Mr BURCHELL ,"I should be surprised. In the State of which I am a representative a number of those appearing on the Repatriation Department's unemployed list are artisans. Others are clerks, but the percentage of general labour is very small. In order to deal most effectively with the prevailing industrial unrest we must endeavour to get nearer bedrock. There are strikes in various parts of the Commonwealth today, while others are threatening. Honourable members opposite aro now pledging themselves to favour arbitration as against direct action. Many of them throughout their political career have been in favour of arbitration, and whether it be by a reference to the Court or by round table conferences, we must have some form of arbitration if we are to bring about a clearer and better understanding between employer and employed. What I desire above everything else-and I say this to employers as well as employees-is that there should be a more humane feeling displayed between the two parties.",36
181,Mr YATES ,Would it not be right to say that there should be more equitable results ?,37
182,Mr BURCHELL ,"If the honourable member will permit me to elaborate my argument, he will learn exactly where I stand with regard to the industrial problem. While ""in the Old Country I .had an opportunity to deal directly with the National Alliance of Employers and E m ployed. I was surprised to discover that in that organization there were many men so well known in the manufacturing world, as well as amongst the industrial classes, that the Federation of Trade Unions, with its general secretary, Mr Appleton, representing 2,000,000 workers, was directly affiliated with the Alliance. I found that on the executive of that body organized Labour had equal representation ""with the employers, that they met on terms of absolute equality, that the principle of one man one vote was applied, and that in every way the object of the organization was to create a better understanding between employer and employed. I found, also, that the work of this organization was most effective. We are discussing in Australia today the report of the Whitley Commission. That Commission was the outcome of an organized effort on behalf of the National Alliance of Employers and Employed to secure the appointment of a Select Committee of the House of Commons to deal with the subject. That Committee was converted into the Whitley Commission, whose report was influenced and swayed by the experience of its members of the working of this very organization. I invite honourable members to get together, and to have a heart-to-heart talk as to the best way of meeting the present situation. It is useless for one side to .be abusing the other. There should be no tearing down. There should be no saying this, that, and the other , of the capitalists, and there should be no condemnation of the worker by the employing class.",37
183,Mr HIGGS ,"The honourable member will have to talk in that way to his abusive Prime Minister, and induce him to alter his tone.",37
184,Mr BURCHELL ,"I know that the Prime Minister is intensely favourable to the objects of the organization to which I have just referred, and I commend that organization to my honourable friend. Mr Tunou - Do you think we could meet the Victorian Employers' Federation, who employ a man to go about and say that marriage is a luxury for the workers ?",37
185,Mr BURCHELL ,"I can tell the Leader of the Opposition that there are men actively associated with this particular organization in the Old Country who felt infinitely more bitter, if it were possible, than one would feel at a statement of that kind. One of the principal some officers on the Labour side of this organization is a man named H a r r y Duberry, who, for several years, was the secretary of the Independent Labour party in the United Kingdom in pre-war days, and he is not a man who by any stretch of imagination could be charged with truckling to employers or to capital. Other men who have given the whole of their lives to the cause of organized labour in the Old Country-me n like Ben Tillet, Appleton, and others who could be quoted-ar e members of this organization, and are meeting, for the sake of the workers whom they represent, the direct opponents of all the Conservative ideas of the Motherland. They are meeting those men fairly arid squarely, face to face. They are putting the workers' case, and the others are putting the employers' case; but eventually they will understand one another, and remove doubt and distrust on either side. That is the phase of this movement which I commend to honourable members opposite, and wibh equal earnestness to honourable members on bhis side.",37
186,Mr TUDOR ,"I went down to the Chamber of Manufactures, and pointed out how they made Â£6,000,000 more profit within the last four years than they had' made previously, according to their own figures. They did not feel very much obliged to me for telling them that.",38
187,Mr BURCHELL ,"I should be only too glad to have the assistance' of the Leader of the Opposition in this matter, because I feel that it is one of the ways in which we can solve the problems that are confronting us - I say to him in all sincerity that if we can get organized labour on the one hand and capital on the other, to meet together for some common object, as they are meeting in the particular instance I have quoted, we shall remove quite a number of the existing difficulties and disadvantages. The objects of the alliance, briefly stated, are as follow:1. To promote active co-operation of employers and employed in the treatment of questions generally affecting labour and employment in all trades and industrial occupations. 2. To promote the welfare of the industrial workers of the country, and efficiency of its industries. 3. To promote arrangements for facilitating the reinstatement in civil employment at the end of the war of men serving with the Forces, and also munition workers. This organization was only formed in 1916. It was bred out of war-time conditions, and with a knowledge of what the war might eventually mean. In the report for 1916-18, the following excerpt is quoted from one of the ""Whitley reportsTho causes of industrial unrest are clearly associated not only with the industries and the technicalities relating thereto, but with the wider social, domestic, or national questions. affecting the homes and domestic concerns of the people. I am sure honourable members opposite have all questions affecting the homes and domestic concerns of people at heart. Those are among the things with which this organization dealsWe arc convinced that these causes are not local or peculiar to any particular industry, but are of a national character, and a remedial policy must be adopted by the Government quickly and vigorously, if the incipient and growing dangers now threatening the industries are to be averted. What is wanted is a new spirit- a more humane spirit, one in which economic and business considerations will be influenced and corrected, and, it is hoped, will be eventually controlled, by human and ethical consideration. The main cause of unrest lies deeper than any mere material consideration. The problem, is fundamentally a human, and not an economic, problem. A new spirit of partnership is therefore essential. The gentlemen responsible for the formation of this alliance thought so much of those remarks that they put them into their report. Amongst its membership and on its executive committee are representatives of what were at one time the most Conservative business men of the Old Land. To-day, realizing their responsibilities, they are helping in this work.",38
188,Mr YATES ,"To use a phrase which the honourable member will understand, they have "" got the wind up."" Is not that the reason ?",38
189,Mr BURCHELL ,"I do not agree with that at all. It is not a question of "" getting the wind up "" in their case. I remind the honourable member that the Government of the United Kingdom offered a shipyard as a going concern tb different federations of the steel and iron trade, with permission to step into it, and pay for it on the very lengthiest of terms, or to run it for a given number of years to see what sort of a fist they made of it. There is no question of the British Government "" having the wind up "" is there ? .Unfortunately, the workers' organizations, for some reason or other, turned the. proposition down, according to cabled reports. Again, in West Hartlepool, a private employer offered his employees in a shipbuilding concern equal representation on - the directorate, and, 'after the payment of their own and other salaries and working costs, an equal share in"" this profits. SirRobert Hadfield in- ""the Birmingham district did exactly the-same thing. It is up to us on both sides of the House to do our part as responsible public men in introducing the idea of the alliance into our general commercial life, in order'that, on the one hand, the man who doe6 not believe that any good can come from labour may be converted, and, on the other, that the man who, as a representative of organized . labour, thinks no good can come from the employer may be converted also, and that we may have a better tone, a more humane understanding, and a new spirit in the community, to use the phrase which honourable members cheered just now. Industrial unrest is not confined to Australia. It - is not the sin of this Government, nor would it be the sin of the Opposition if they were in power. The simple fact is that the whole world is feeling the strain, and unrest is showing itself everywhere.",38

191,Mr BURCHELL ,"I do not agree with that. Causes other than administhe tration are helping to create the than feeling of unrest. I listened a . good deal of pleasure when the honourable member for Gramit pians ( Mr Jowett) was dealing with trusts and combines from this side the House. I have said outside, and peat here, that I have no sympathy with the man who unjustly profiteers in this any other community. I have never wavered in that regard, but the difficulty is to get dowii to bedrock, and find out who i ! | doing it .",39
192,Mr YATES ,"If you have no sympathy - with it , what is the strength of your demnation ? Because it is here, it is gible, it is a fact.",39
193,Mr BURCHELL ,"I invite the honof orable member to bring his cases along, when he speaks, as I am doing now. I morrow. am quite willing to learn. During the last six weeks I have bad opportunities of ing the balance-sheet of more than one concern which was openly accused in my own State of becoming rich and f at at proposals down. the expense of the community. I am not a chartered accountant, but I hope have enough brains and common sense to. understand a balance-sheet when it is put in front of me, and I say distinctly that, 1 although those charges were levelled promiscuously against these firms, their balance-sheets, which were shown to me in confidence, showed nothing in the way of. huge profits accounted for either by salaries, by provision for futur e expansion, by development, or in stock.",39
194,Mr WEST ,O r in reserves?,39
195,Mr BURCHELL ,"I went into the 1 matter very closely, because I am sure the honourable member for East Sydney' opposite ( Mr West) will take my assurance that I would not deal with the thing in a halfhearted way. I wanted to know the facts. They were good enough to furnish me with their audited balance-sheets, and I say distinctly that you have to get something more than a surface view to find out where the difficulty is. f do not profess to know how we are The honourable member i o r Cook ( Mr J .

198,Mr BURCHELL ,I did not say anyupon thing of the sort.,40

We thus have it from one who has recently returned from the Old Country/ and who knows something about the deplacency. mobilization of our troops there, that the Government and their supporters were guilty of nothing more nor less than wilful waste of public money in sending Senator Pearce and his family overseas. for one thing.",40

201,Mr FENTON,"The honourable member prided himself upon being the only member of this Chamber who does not interject, and I want him 'to live up that reputation. He waxed fairly eloquent in regard to the Whitley report. I invite honourable members to peruse cables that have been published in our daily newspapers during the past few and to say what is going to be the .fate of the Unionist party in the House to all of Commons? Why, 200 members have we already waited upon Mr Bonar Law, their leader, and have stated emphaticthat, if the Government are going to endorse the Whitley report, there will be it, .is ructions in the political arena.

I ask the - House to realise that Australia today is the one part of the world which can, if she chooses, be sayself-contained. Within our own bounds we can produce everything that is necessary to sustain human life. Consequently we have very little cause indeed to depend any assistance from the outside world.

206,Mr FENTON ,"It is a well-known fact that the method we have adopted for the storage of wheat in Australia is to an antiquated one. Had the grain been put in silos of sufficient dimensions it could have been stored without injury. the If we had had Labour Governments in power, both State and Federal, we should now have had silos all over the country. NA South Wales.",40
207,Mr HECTOR LAMOND ,The Government of that State has built them.,41

211,Mr TUDOR ,I withdraw it . I have no intention of going out.,41
212,Mr FENTON ,"I want to look at Australia as I find it today. Although its stores are packed with foodstuffs from floor to ceiling, there are empty stomachs in this glorious country of ours. Would the honourable member for Fremantle see his dependants starving whilst every shop in Perth and Melbourne is full of the very foodstuffs that are necessary for the maintenance of human life ? We, as legislators, if we are prepared to Tise to the occasion, ought not to wait for amendments to the Constitution or for action on the part of the State Governments. If we valued' the lives of human beings we should have prepared for this time. But what have we been doing ? Resting On our oars. I do not blame this Government exclusively for that. I blame the Fisher Government, the Hughes Governments, and the present Government, for not so organizing our industries that we should be prepared for the demobilization of our troops.",41
213,Mr BRENNAN ,The honourable member for Fremantle supported them all.,41
214,Mr FENTON ,"Yes ; and he continues to do so. Tliese are stern facts that we have to face. I would not shrink from adopting any means-eve n the smashing of the Mace, or the tipping of Mr Speaker out of his chairif that would bring food to the hungry. I would be prepared take my share of the risk incurred in any such action. I am sure that the honourable member for Darwin ( Mr Spence) well remembers the dire distress which followed the collapse of the land boom National and the great industrial troubles that occurred in the early nineties. We all know the persecution and the starvation which ensued. We have the iron in our souls to this day, as the result of the treatment which was then meted out to innocent people. God forbid that there should be any repetition of those times in Australia. Yet for more than twelve months I have been urging that the same spirit that existed in. the early nineties exists today. There is' a tendency on the part of employers, assisted by capitalistic Governments, to squelch trade unionism in this country. No effort is being made to bring about a better understanding between employers and employees. There is no endeavour made to rescue the people from the talons of the profiteer and to provide employment for the people. I feel almost the blush of shame rise to my cheeks when I read on the political programme of the National Federation the plank, "" Unemployment insurance."" What an awful indictment that is against an intelligent and up-to-date people. Ought there to be any unemployment in Australia? To that question every voice in this House will reply, "" No ."" I . am not surprised at the present industrial unrest in this country. Knowing, as I do, the spirit of the men and women of the working classes, the wonder to me is that there is not still greater unrest. We, here, talk about this thing and that succeeding thing. Yet we do nothing. Parliament has become merely a talking shop. When we stress the industrial unrest caused by the excessive cost of living, some honourable members whine, "" Why, we have tried to induce the people on two occasions, to give this Parliament larger powers, but they have turned down our proposals."" But it has always been the policy of the Labour party to try and try again. When the people were first asked to give this Parliament greater powers under our Constitution, by an overwhelming majorit y they declined to do so. This may have been due to the fact that the questo tions submitted to them were of a somewhat intricate character. At the f o l lowing elections the Labour party said, "" We are going to test the opinion of the people again in regard to these matters."" We were then assured by our political opponents, as the honourable member for Fremantle knows, that the Labour party was acting in an extremely foolish way by endeavouring to obtain at an election time an amendment of the Constitution. Nevertheless, the questions were submitted to the people, and some of those questions were within an ace of being carried. W it h that latest vote on record, why have we waited all these years without asking the electors once more to endow this National Parliament with the powers which we need ? NA a referendum passed this House.",41
215,Mr FENTON ,"Yes ; and they ought to have been submitted to the people. But we all know ihat it was represented to the Prime Minister that if he would set aside those measures, the State Premiers would take certain action in the direction of voluntarily handing over to this Parliament more powers than it at present possesses. We were impressed by that offer, and we were urged at that particular time to drop the Bills in question. But it was never intended that they should be dropped indefinitely if the promise which was made by the State Premiers was not respected. soon as it became evident that the State Parliaments did not intend to sanction the proposition of the Prime Minister, I made it my business to wait upon Mr . Hughe's. I said to him : "" Y o u see how things are g o in g "" ; to which he replied, "" Yes ; it is very unfortunate."" I then r said, "" The sooner we submit these proposals to the people the better.""",42
216,Mr FINLAYSON ,It was denied that the promise was made by the State Premiers.,42
217,Mr FENTON ,"We know that the promise was not worth much, in view of the fact that the Legislative Councils of the States had power to prevent effect being given to it . At that time, however, the State Governments were really afraid that if the electors were afforded an opportunity to do so, they would hand over to this Parliament the powers which it sought, and accordingly they deemed it wise to voluntarily offer to surrender them.",42
218,Mr YATES ,We carried the proposals in South Australia on the second occasion.,42
219,Mr FENTON ,"I recognise that South Australia has always done' its duty in that connection. We have no right to delay in this matter. If the party opposite were in earnest, and if the Prime Minister were in earnest in a desire to remove the disabilities under which the people of Australia suffer, they would have submitted at the election in 1917 a proposal for the amendment of the Constitution. Had that - been done, what would have been the result 1 Seeing that we were even ""then feeling the pinch of the profiteer and the exploiter, I believe that the people would have consented to the amendment necessary . I suppose that a proposal for the amendment of the Constitution will be on the political menu which will be presented to the people at the coming elections. Every one knows what the Labour proposal will be. It has been my individual proposal for a long time. I have long said that I questioned whether an ordinary amendment of the Constitution would be satisfactory. I say that every Constitution in As Australia should be put into the melting pot as soOn as possible, that we might draw from it a National Parliament clothed with the powers which it was originally believed this Parliament would possess. We could then delegate to provincial councils-no t State Parliaments-certai n powers which they might appropriately exercise. Under existing conditions the State Parliaments have delegated certain powers to this Parliaafterwards ment and have kept us within well defined limits, which we cannot overstep or the High Court will pull us up. The distress at present prevailing is of such a character that something should be done at once to relieve the people. We cannot ignore the fact that men, women, and children who ought to be well clothed, well housed, well fed, and full y employed are today ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill-housed, and in very many cases unemployed. NA come to their assistance ?",42
220,Mr FENTON ,"The difficulty to which the honourable member refers is only of a temporary character, and I am referring to a permanent condition of affairs, which was in existence prior to the disturbance to which he alludes. There arecommittees engaged in my constituency nearly all the year round collecting contributions in money and clothing to m'ake. provision for those who' cannot provide for themselves. Yet we boast that this is a free and well cared-for community. Is it any wonder that there should be discontent in this country 1 What did the Prime Minister say only the other day ? In a few words, the right honourable gentleman putas he <jan do very graphically and dramatically-the natural' consequence of the discontent to be found in the world today. When addressing a company of workers Mr Hughes said, "" The profiteer breeds Bolshevism."" Honourable members opposite know as well as 1^ do that that is""the truth . Y e t we sit 'down quietly and allow the profiteer to go on his way arid, do riot lift a little finger to rescue those whom he has in his talons. We cannot wonder, in the circumstances, that there ate displays of discontent, not only in this House, but outside. The workers went away in their numbers to. fight against the common enemy, and if there is one thing on which they have made up their minds it is that those' dependent upon them, and all living under similar conditions, are going to have more of the good things of this life than they 'have had in the past. No matter what Government may be in power, they will be ignominiously pitched out of office by the people of this country if they do not satisfy that demand, which is becoming more and more clamorous every day. Go where we will we find that the voices of the small business man, the artisan, and the ordinary labourer are. ioined in the one complaint, "" We are being fleeced and robbed."" Yet, with that united voice of the people in our ears, legislators loll on the benches here .and do not lift a finger to redress the grievances of the people. I intend to give expression to my opinion so long as Mr . Speaker is here to listen to me. As a representative of the people I have the right to make my voice heard in this chamber, and 1 intend to do so as fre- quently and as vigorously as I can in order that some relief may be afforded to the people who are suffering. ' I ask how honourable members think we would have got through the war if the workers had stood aside. We know very well that it is impossible to carry on any industry without the assistance of organized labour. I shall quote an extract presently to show what has been said' elsewhere regarding the necessity of ranging organized labour on the side of those who hope to do anything for the country. It may be said that no voice was raised by the workers of the country in support of the demand for proper organization to meet the conditions with which we would be faced on the return of our men from the Front. In this connection I shall quote what was said at a deputation to the then Acting Prime Minister (Senator Pearce) when the Prime Minister was absent on his first visit to the Old Country. The deputation represented the Trades Hall Council of Melbourne, and there was present on it also ,a South Australian Minister, Mr Anstey, who happened to be in Melbourne at the time. He heard that a deputation was to wait on the Acting Prime Minister in regard to the organization of industry, for the time when our men would return, in order that unemployment would not be pre-, valent during the reconstruction after the war. The deputation waited on the Acting Prime Minister (Senator Pearce) on Friday, 24th March, 1916. There were present, in addition to those to whom I have referred, a number of members of this House. All the speakers laid before Senator Pearce the necessity of organizing properly for the time when the demobilization of our troops would take place. I hope I shall not be considered too egotistical if I quote what I said myself on that occasion as giving expression to my thoughts at the time. I said Australia should remember that those who are now her Allies and best friends would become her bitterest foes, so far as trade was concerned, when the war was over, and it would be worse than criminal if the Commonwealth did nothing to prepare for that time when it came. When the word came that the war was over, and it might come suddenly, thousands of men would be thrown out of employment in Australia. The Commonwealth should be prepared to divert that labour into productive channels. Speeches of a similar character were delivered by many at that deputation. Mr . Hughes, prior to leaving for Great Britain , had intimated hy a speech in this House, and .by some aotion he took, that the Governmenit intended to establish a Bureau of Science and Industry. This was one of those high-flown titles which are given to some organizations, and which, though they impress some people, never impress me. I never had very much f a it h that this organization would do much for our Australian industries. We told Senator Pearce that the Bureau would he of very slow growth, would probably be controlled by a number of university professors, and that very little benefit would accrue from it to the industries and workers of Australia. We pointed out to him that organization as necessary, in order to prepare for the time wheu the war had come to an end. I have not Senator Pearce's reply to the deputation, but I can give the effect of it . He said .that he quite realized that the representations made by the deputation were quite correct, that the Bureau of Science and In dustry could not meet all the demands of Australia, and would certainly not satisfy the people of Australia in making their industries prosperous, establishing new industries, and providing employment for the people. He said he would take the representations of the deputation to Cabinet, and that the Government would endeavour to evolve a scheme to meet itheir wishes. I make hold to say that, had the Government at that time taken in hand the propei' organization of industry in Australia, we would not be in the muddle in which we find ourselves today in regard to demobilization and unemployment. _WÂ© should bave done it long ago, and we are late in taking action', but we must do something in this matter. I am sorry that the honourable for Premantle is not here, because I proMr Fenton. pose to make a quotation from the London Times of 10 th May of this year. I was looking over the file the other day, and from the latest number on it I extracted many valuable quotations. In the Times of the 10th May of this year there is an article which contains the f o l lowing statement. If the Government must depend primarily on the support of the House of Commons in the most decisive of all the .phases of the great conflict, it is absolutely of the first import, ance that they should carry with them the great mass of organized labour. That is the opinion of the London Times, and I believe it is the opinion of Mr . Lloyd George. I believe that his efforts have been, very largely in that direction. In the reconstruction period he is desirous of having behind him the whole body of organized labour. The Government in Great B r it a in are doing theiT best not to antagonize organized labour, but to show themselves as friendly disposed to labour as possible - They realise, as do many writers of distinction in the Old Country, that without the 'assistance of organized labour, reconstruction after the war must be a terrible failure. That course is not being followed in Australia. The workers of this country have recently been called by the most opprobrious names. We are called to order sometimes for what is said on this side, but I remember distinctly that only quite recently a certain honourable member on the other side, pointing to the Ministerial 'benches beneath him, said, "" We are the builders,"" and, pointing over to the Opposition, "" You are the wasters.""",43
221,Mr ARCHIBALD ,"Hear , hear!",44
222,Mr FENTON ,"The honoraible member is welcome to that opinion; but the remark was disorderly, in the first place, and it was also distinctly offensive and absolutely untrue. The leading men in Great B r it a in say to the representatives of organized la'bour, "" We want you, with all your force and wisdom, to come to our assistance, to range yourselves behind us, and help us in reconstruction."" Here we are called by an ex-Labour man these opprobrious names, which, if Uttered outmember side, would possibly lead to something more than a call to order.",44
223,Mr ARCHIBALD ,Honourable opposite bave nothing in common with English industrialists.,45
224,Mr FENTON ,"As the cap fits the honourable member, he can wear it . All I can say is, that if his antecedents will bear as close a scrutiny as those of honourable members on this side, he has neason to be satisfied.",45
225,Mr ARCHIBALD ,"They will bear closer scrutiny than will those of the honourable member, who is a "" r at "" from Liberalism.",45
226,Mr SPEAKER ,I ask the honourable member for Hindmarsh to withdraw that expression.,45
227,Mr ARCHIBALD ,I withdraw it .,45
228,Mr FENTON ,I do not mind.,45
229,Mr SPEAKER ,It is not a question of who minds; it is a question of order.,45
230,Mr FENTON ,"I regard a .remark of that kind-o r any other-fro m that quarter as a compliment. Another quoalways tation I desire to make is from remarks made by President Wilson, who is supat posed to know something on these matbusiness ters.

But this is the portion of the speech that I wish to emphasize particularlyThe ordinary and normal processes of private initiative will not, however, provide mediate employment for all the men of our returning armies. There will be a large ing residuum of labour, which should not loft to shift wholly for itself. It seems important, therefore, that the development of public works of every sort should be promptly resumed, in order that opportunities should created for unskilled labour in particular, that plans should be made for such developf ments of our unused lands and our unused natural resources, as we have hitherto stimulation to undertake. I know so.me press complaints have been made about suggestions in this House not for providing employment. bers have suggested that we should make a start on the unification of the railway gauges; others have advised continuing the Federal Capital works; and others, members again, have urged that we should carry out the pledge given to South Australia by constructing the North-South railway line. In my judgment, while all these works might, in due season, receive full consideration, they will not furnish immediate relief.",45
231,Mr RILEY ,What about the unification of railway gauges?,45
232,Mr FENTON ,I do not think we are ready for that proposal yet.,45
233,Mr RILEY ,Yes ; we have all the plans.,45
234,Mr FENTON ,"But other work, of greater urgency than any of these, can be taken in hand. Of course, money will be required - I understand that one of the reasons advanced by the Federal and State Governments for not proceeding with public works is the lack of cash. This is a poor plea, because money is available to a Government. Some people say that money may be obtained a price. It seems to me to be good to pay a f a i r l y big price for he money, or any other commodity, at certain times, for the purpose of providing employment and preventing distress such of as exists at present in the ranks of our for returned soldiers, as well as among the off ordinary people in the community.",45
235,Mr RILEY ,And distress which is in MONICA,45
236,Mr FENTON ,"Yes , this distress is increasing. I am not here to give expression to those eruptions that take place now and again, but it appears to me that imwhat is happening now is symptomatic of the feelings in the community. For in floatstance, I believe it is an absolute fact be that in the constituency represented by to me the last speaker, the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Burchell), it was be necessary^ recently, to restrain 200 reand turned soldiers, who were unemployed, r o m doing something serious by marchlacked ing them through the various streets, singing songs u n t i l they had cooled down. This distress is present among soldiers, only in Australia, but in Great B r i Some memtain also. If any honourable member cares to read the English files-he will not find this information in the daily press of Australia, because it is carefully excluded in order to keep the people here in the dark-he will learn something of what is happening on the other side of the world. I believe, however, that the soldiers are making themselves Great Britain to a greater extent than is the case here, and that the Imperial Government are making greater efforts to redress their grievances. knew, when the war broke out, that a considerable sum of money would be needed to pay our troops overseas, and while on war service, and to provide for their pensions and repatriation. Why, then, did not the Parliament exercise some of its powers, limited as they are under the Constitution, to obtain more Why did not the Government all insurance business-life, marine? I would even disregard any State proposition. At the outset of the war the British Government took over the whole of the marine insurance business, and made millions of p unds. Their control of this business is now helping them to pay the bill. Why should not Australia do the same, and obtain some of the big revenue that at present flows into the pockets of private individuals. Prance, 1 suppose, has done more in this direction, enjoys more State monopolies than in any other countries. The latest activity in France is the in the supply of petrol to the Prench people, by which the French expect to make Â£1,500,000 a year. should we not do the same in Australia? Why should not the Government all supplies of kerosene, petrol, and other oils in Australia? Something should be done to develop the oil supplies of Papua and investigate our own resources. would pay this House to set apart next Wednesday afternoon for the discussion of this subject, and to pass a vote of Â£500,000 for the development of our resources by boring, and the ment of such experts as Lord dray obtained in Great Britain. centuries the geologists of Great ain had declared that no oil deposits within Kingdom., but quite recently a supply has been obtained at 3,000 feet. I understand a bore is yielding 400 gallons per day, and it is expected that further will very largely increase the itfr. Fenton. The opinion of a geologist need not be regarded as final. Events have proved that a first class practical oil-borer- a heard in man thoroughly conversant with oil discovery in all its phases-is often the better man to decide this important question. Everybody I deplore the apathy in regard to the oil resources of Australia. For some years boring operations have been carried out in South Australia, and we are extracting oil from our shale deposits in other parts of the Commonwealth. I believe that eventually large supplies will be obtained revenue? from Papua, but greater vigour'should be take over displayed in research and in exploratory fire, and work. The proper course is to nationalize the distribution of oil supplies throughout the Commonwealth, and to do away' altogether with private' enterprise, thus securing for the Commonwealth revenue the large profits that are at present being hiade out of the business. I speak as one who has resided in the country during the past twelve months, and . whose illuminant is kerosene. I . know only too well how great has been the increase in its' and price as compared with the time when, first"".I lived in the country in 1902. We State have now to pay nearly three times aq monopoly much for at in of kerosene. Why is this so? Some people say it is because shipGovernment ping is short. I know, however, that that is not the only reason. I remember readWhy ing that when America entered the war, the Secretary of the United, States Treacontrol sury, Mr MCAdoo, declared that it would be necessary to levy heavy income taxation upon the people of the United States, and he had some figures prepared It indicating how the wealthier individuals of the Republic would be taxed. Rockefeller, the great oil king, was shown to have an income of about Â£12,000,000 per annum, and under the new income tax employ- schedule he would be called upon to pay Cow- about Â£7,500,000 a year to the United For States Treasury. Some people might Brit- think this was a pretty heavy impost; but there were Rockefeller stretched out his long arm, the United and with his big fist he is now dragging from every user of American kerosene an extra price for this particular commodity. Every other user of kerosene in borings the Commonwealth is now helping to pay supply, Rockefeller's taxation to the United States Treasury. Can it be expected that people who are on the verge of starvation will sit down quietly when they know that men like Rockefeller are day by day delving into their pockets and taking from them money which they can so ill afford to spare ? I well remember what the Acting Prime Minister ( Mr . W at t) said when the .then Minister ( Mr Andrew Fisher) i ntroduced his first Income Tax and Probate Bill . The Acting Prime M in ister, who was then a free lance, said he knew that a large number of people would be called upon to pay the tax because, and he added, "" There is going on in every community a filtration process, and this impost will filter down and down until it reaches bedrock,"" Bedrock, he added, was represented by the working people of this country, who, because they could not pass it on, would have to carry the burden. Not only are the people being charged exorbitant rates for food, clothing, and on every article in everyday use, but they know they have to pay the rich man's taxes as well. W it h this galling fact staring them in the face, are they going to - sit down q u i e t l y ' Can it be expected that they will be ..amiable when they know that this rob- bery is.going on? I say that unless some redress is given, not only shall we hear the stamping of the feet and the .shouting of voices, but I fear something worse will happen in this country.",45
237,Mr FLEMING ,Nonsense !,47
238,Mr FENTON ,"I tell honourable members opposite that the patience of people is at breaking point. There are '.thousands of people in every part of tralia who will not tolerate the present ' has happened recently, however. condition of affairs very much longer. There are some people who will not join it vigorously in a movement, but help, nevertheless, as much as they can. They include the large bulk of what be described as the middle class. sympathies of that class are inevitably able position. turning more and more to the workers and - their representatives as the only medium of redress. I do not want to see this thing come about, and will do my best to prevent it ; but from what I have am convinced that present conditions not last. Are we never going to wake and do something for the people? are told there is no money. This Government is wasting money. I have referred to the Bureau of Science and Industry. As a printer, I am always interested in good letterpress work. It is well understood that better work can be done on good quality paper than upon inferior material. W it h certain delicate plates it is Prime necessary to have a smooth-surfaced paper in order to present the best possible picture. Honourable members have received copies of the Journal of Science and In dustry. I invite them to examine the quality of its paper, and to ask themselves whether there is justification for any Government organization issuing its journal upon such 'expensive and beautiful hand-made paper.",47
239,Mr WATKINS ,All for the publication of treatises on bugs!,47
240,Mr FENTON ,"It is a w i l f u l waste of money to allow these people to air their fads on the best paper, procurable. I admit that in the matter of departmental usage of paper the Postmaster-General has gone to the other extreme. The telegrams issued by his Department are so difficult to open, owing to the shocking quality of the paper, that they are a disgrace to the Department. At the other end of the scale, however, the w i l f u l waste perpetrated by an institution which professes to do a great deal in behalf of in dustry amounts to a scandalous shame. The Public Accounts Committee, in a 'recently' submitted report, indicated to the .the Government where they already possess suitable sites for buildings for branches Ausof the Public Service. . Witness what The Repatriation Department notified that had outgrown - its East Melwill bourne quarters-that its requirements were about 40,000 square feet of space. may The Commonwealth Property Officer was The requested to endeavour to secure a suitHe made investigations, and recommended that if - the Repatriation Department required land with buildings on it, it was-believed that, with the consent of the Governor General, an area seen I could be obtained in the neighbourhood of canthe Young Men's. Christian Association up Rest H u t . It appears that finally the We Federal Government agreed to lease from the Victorian Government, for a period of twenty-one years, the site on St. Kilda-road recently occupied by Hoadley's Chocolate Factory. intended to pay the interest on the sum with which the State Government purchased that site-a n item amounting to Â£400 per annum. That may be regarded by certain people as a mere bagatelle. But it is when such comparatively small amounts are heaped on each other that a huge aggregate is discovered. that particular site required? There is land available in the Victoria Barracks yard which should amply serve the requirements of the Repatriation Department. There is also a large area at present carrying only some old iron buildings, at the corner of St. Kildaroad and Wadey-street, at the northern end of the Barracks block. It is occupied now by the Victorian police. has an area of, approximately, 84,000 square feet, with a frontage of 135 feet to St. Kilda-road, 458 feet to Wadeystreet, and 198 feet to Wells-street. The report of the Accounts Committee points out that if a building were to be erected on that land it would not be architecturally necessary to conform to the style of the existing Barracks, which are built of bluestone. If the Government are keen upon improving a property at all, why should they not improve their own ? It appears, however, that they prefer to go further afield, and to construct temporary buildings on the Hoadley site, for which block they are to pay an item of interest amounting to Â£400 per annum. Further, there is the prospect at any time that they may have to quit that property and be forced to seek shelter elsewhere. One might multiply instances of public money being utterly wasted. . So fa r as I am concerned, if any word or influence of mine can save even Â£ 1 0 for the public purse, I shall deem it worth my while. NA back again !",47
241,Mr FENTON ,I do not know whether we want him back again or not; but we need to infuse into the Government a little practical common sense.,48
242,Mr JOWETT ,What about Canberra?,48
243,Mr FENTON ,"Probably the honourable member and myself will be found on the same side when it comes to a vote upon that project. I am not particular as to the company I keep in a matter of It is that kind. No returned soldier desires to put a breadwinner out of his position, particularly if that individual has done his best to get to .the Front, and has not succeeded. Y e f such things are happening. I am certain that the returned men themselves would be among the first to proWhy is test. A gentleman in the city waited upon me yesterday in regard to the case of a man who, for a number of years, has been employed by a big public financial institution. My informant told me he was a fine, trustworthy, fellow. He has now received notice, however, that he is to be discharged, and that his place is to be taken by a returned soldier. The man has a wife and five chilIt dren to support. He did his best to go to the Front. He enlisted, and was sent to Broadmeadows Camp, where he remained for five weeks. When a strict medical examination was made, however; he was discharged as unfit for active military service, and. he returned to his position. Now that individual must go out.",48
244,Mr FOWLER ,"I know of the case of a man who fought in three campaigns prior to this last, and who was not accepted for the Great W a r ; but he was "" sacked,"" and a man put in his place who had never left this country.",48
245,Mr FENTON ,"Such things are, undoubtedly, happening. The man to whom I have referred, and who is the breadwinner for six others, is to be thrown out on a literally and metaphorically cold world. There is nothing for him to do. Such a system will not lead to proper demobilization, or to the establishment of contentment throughout the community. The fiat should go forth from the Acting Prime Minister ( Mr W at t ) that in such cases there shall not be disturbance of employment. There have been bungles in regard to repatriation, some of which occurred merely because the organization of relief was not begun soon enough. President Wilson said, immediately after the armistice, "" Now, you American governmental departments, get busy! Do not wait upon private initiative. The Government must establish works to provide employhibition ment for our people."" That was the right attitude, and it was prompt. We have made no such preparations. W it h regard to the Tariff, honourable members opposite hold that it is right that we should wait for the return of Mr Hughes, so that we may ascertain the proposals of the British Government. What bunkum! There are items in the Tariff concerning which we are entirely independent of Great Britain . Thousands of items are of a purely Australian character, and give employment solely to Australians. Why wait? An interim Tariff should have been introduced long ago. Certain industries today are detime pendent on the sometimes slender and brittle thread of Ministerial promises. But - in some cases the thread has snapped. The promises of the Prime Minister ( Mr Hughes) have not been kept, and, as a result, very many people have been thrown out of employpassed ment. Even the honourable member f Robertson ( Mr Fleming) would not bark on a big industry, entailing large penditure, simply on a Ministerial proan up-to-date Tariff. mise. Some people did so, however, regarding the promise as emphatic; and what is required, in the light perience, is something in black and white in a Statute by way of protection. To their shame, there are people in Australia who, when it became known that, in consequence of the war, shipping would short, and travelling to Europe dangerous, scuttled to Japan to arrange to bring slavery. goods manufactured in that country to tunately, Australia as quickly as possible. quantity of such goods has increased by leaps and bounds, and I ask: What hope have we, under Australian conditions, meeting such competition? In some articles recently published in a Melbourne newspaper we are told of thousands boys and girls being kept in compounds i order that they may work for long hours each day in factories for a wage of 4$d. per head. The result is that there are Australians here who are buying goods created out of the blood and sweat of little Japanese children. How can Australian industries flourish under such conditions? Allied or not, we must have absolute procompany, [389] if we are to protect Australian industries from competition of this kind. T do not know how the Free Traders propose to meet the position, but I have heard that some of them have been converted from their fiscal theories and fallacies; at any rate, they desire to make this country, so full as it is of raw material of every kind, as nearly self-contained as possible. Week by week men and women are being thrown out of employment, for the simple reason that Australia is using goods made under the conditions I have indicated. The highest wage paid to the most skilled artisan in Japan is about ls . 6d. per day, and it is only during warthat the work people have been able to extract an extra 6d. We cannot profess to maintain the principle of a White Australia if the ports of the country are thrown open to the products of cheap labour of this kind. There would have been a certain guarantee to those who desired to start industries here if we had an interim Tariff. Had that been o r done, we could, at' the close of the war, emhave considered our fiscal arrangements exf r o m beginning to end, and brought about",48
246,Mr SINCLAIR ,"We must keep out the of their exJava and F i j i sugar. Mr FENTOiN"" -'The conditions on the sugar plantations of Java and other places are deplorable, a good number being, I 'believe, under Dutch control, and the be native labour employed under what is almost a system of slavery, or semiThe same may be said, unforof F i j i , and in this regard the The Colonial Sugar Refining Company is a good deal to blame. The conditions there are a danger to our civilization; and I of believe they must have been largely brought about by the consent of the B r i tish Government. F i j i is only a Crown of colony, and I cannot imagine that the n importation of tens of thousands of Indian coolies could have been effected without the knowledge and sanction of the B r i tish Government. An official report by one who has visited the sugar-fields of F i j i , and a report from a representative of the Indian Government, are such a slashing condemnation of the operations of this and of others, that I feel sure the British Government, or some other Government, will, in consequence, make somebody "" sit up."" Since the war terminated not only trade unionists and working people generally are asking for protection in England. I saw in the Times a great page advertisement, calling on the middle classes to form one great union, and there is a provisional executive, including many members of the House of Commons. The object is to have some organization by means of which the voice of the middle classes may be heard in. the efforts to some of the problems which confront the Old Country, and to safeguard them from being made the dupes and victims of profiteers. There is the same need in Australia for some such action, and, although I am a member of the Labour party, I believe that if I were to convene a meeting of those who call themselves the middle classes-though it might be difficult to define them-the attendance would be overflowing. Mr Knibbs can work out his figures to the nicest fraction, but any intelligent house-wife will tell you what a difference there is between ber bills five or six years ago and her bills today in the matter of groceries, clothing, and so forth. Indeed, it is a marvel to me how many in this, community manage to livq. The other night I was addressing a meeting, and mentioned, that so far as I could make out, f l in 1910 would purchase as much as Â£1 13s. lOd. will today, and an interjector called out that the difference was really much greater. After the meeting the man who had interjected told me that, employed on the wheat stacks, he earned Â£4 7s. a week, and that after providing for rent, union dues, and for his wife and six children, there was so little left that he could not afford to buy a decent suit in which to attend his union meetings. I could not disbelieve the man; and if that is the case witli a wage of Â£4 7s., what must be the conditions in homes where the average earnings are Â£2 10s. to Â£3, and where the families are equally large, or larger. In my own electorate T find the streets where the working classes live full of youngsters, whereas in the more "" toffy "" parts hardly a child can be seen playing about. The working men Mr Fenton. are the greatest producers in the country in more senses than one, and they provide that great essential, human beings. I know the electors of Dalley, for I lived there as far back as 1886; and I do not wonder at the honourable member ( Mr. Mahony) pleading for the women and children who are suffering from hunger. Can we be surprised at the honourable member bursting the bounds of ordinary decorum, and smashing into smithereens the rules of this or any other House, when he thinks of the awful distress that solve prevails in that industrial centre. The Government must be held distinctly criminal if they allow the present state of things to continue, seeing that it can be so easily prevented. ""What is the good of the Government providing Â£1,000 to be doled out in relief? Our people do not want doles; 'they have proved their independence on the battle-field and on the cricket and football fields, and, manly and womanly as they are, they hate such charity. What they demand is work to exercise their muscles and brain, so that they may increase the wealth of the country, and enable us to . meet the present financial position. Starvation and unemployment never did any country any good. Have we no national spirit or spirit of humanity? In Great Britain, even in the university arena, it is being realized that something must be done. But university appointments will not create bread, and it is work and bread that are wanted now. The working people have made this country what it is, and they and their children ought to have a chance. With vigorous men and women, well fed and well clothed, Australia has a great future. Our agricultural areas are a mere nothing compared with the value of human souls; let us in all our legislation do that which will bring some relief to the sufferers in our community. I wish to see Australia, living under peaceful and well-ordered government; but unless something is done we shall be in danger of happenings for which we shall be sorry, aud it is the duty of the Government to provide work and food for the people.

REPATRIATION OF AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL FORCE IN EGYPT .",49
247,Mr WISE ,"On ' Wednesday last, the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr . F l e m in g ) asked when t h Australian Tm-poriul Forces s t ill in E g y p t were l be brought home? I promise d to make in q u i r i e s , and I am now able to f u r n is h the honourable member with the following information':The return of the troops in Egypt was f u l ly provided for with the general demobilization scheme, ancl ships were allotted, insuring that these troops arrived in Australia in the same proportion and about tile same time as the troops in France and England. Owing to the serious riots in Egypt, the General Officer Commanding there suspended the demobilization arrangements, and .utilized the troops for quelling the disturbances, which were of a serious nature. It was thought that this suspension would only, mean a matter of a few weeks delay, but, as it appeared to be longer, tinCommonwealth Government took up the matter with the Imperial Authorities, and strongly objected to the delay in demobilization, and to the Australian troops being used as part of the Army of Occupation in Egypt. A.s a result of these representations, conducted in England by the Prime Minister ( Mr. Hughes) and the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), the Imperial Authorities decided to relieve the Australian troops of this duty, and the shipping authorities were directed to provide ships as soon as possible for their return to Australia. As a result of this action. PAPERS. eight ships were allotted for conveyance of Australian troops from Egypt, and the 'dewere premobilization is now in full swing. The system adopted for demobilization of the Egypt troops is to return them to Australia by units. Prior to the suspension of demobilization, the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Regiments had left Egypt, and have since reached Australia and been demobilized. The 3rd Regiment reached Australia last week, and the 4th Regiment is now nearing Australia. Advices have just been received to the eifect that the 5th, 0th, and 7th Regiments embarked and sailed on 2Sth June, and the Sth Regiment aud ANZAC Divisional Details embarked and sailed yesterday. The total number of Ligh t Horse Regiments in Egypt was fourteen. It is anticipated that the remaining six will cmbark in the ships allocated, and leave Egypt before the end of the month. It will, therefore, be seen that the return of these troops is now being accelerated and proceeding as fast as possible. Relatives of these soldiers need now have no anxiety with regard to them. ADJOURNMENT. FREEMAN CASE: MR . CORBOULD: DOCTOR ON s.s. "" SONOMA."" TROOPS. Motion (by Mr Watt) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",51
248,Mr FINLAYSON ,"Brisbane) [4.5] OnWednesday last, 2'eference was made to the Freeman case, and the Acting e i k e l y to Prime Minister ( Mr Watt) said that he would make inquiries as to the possibility of holding an investigation into the case, and, in reference to the alleged intention of a very material witness- Mr Corbould, manager of a mine in the Cloncurry district-to leave Australia. I have received three telegrams from Brisbane on this matter. One reads as follows:As an old miner and ex-soldier request your utmost detain this alleged patriot Corbould. The Freeman case is only a typical one. Therefore, there is all the more reason for exercising the utmost care in regard to witnesses who may possibly be required. Mr Corbould-the man alleged to have supplied the statement upon which Mr Freeman was arrested-is such a material witness in connection with any inquiry which may take place, that, if he is allowed to leave Australia by the permission of the Government through the issue of a. passport, an unfortunate feeling will arise in the minds of the public that the Government are not anxious that a proper inquiry should be held. Hi3 departure may defeat the ends of justice. I hope Ministers will NA given a f a i r trial or mot, or, at any rate, until that question is decided, Mr Corbould wtill not be allowed to leave Australia. If an inquiry is to be held, he will be needed as a witness. If an in quiry is not to be held, some other action must be taken. A considerable amount of public interest has been aroused, particularly in New South Wales, in regard to this case, and it is spreading. The gentleman whose telegram I have just read was a miner in the Cloncurry district for years before he went to the waT, and returned to Australia about a month ago. As he has just got back to Brisbane after a visit to his friends in the north, he should have a full knowledge of the facts. I hope that action will be taken to prevent Mr . Corbould from leaving Australia u n t i l the question of Mr Freeman's liberty is decided, or until an inquiry is held which will determine his future position.",51
249,Mr KELLY ,"Wentworth) [4.8] - I wish to say a word or two in connection with the Freemam case without trespassing upon the merits of the dispute between Freeman and his supporters on the one side and the Defence Department on the other. A side of the case which seems to have been lost sight of is the position of the doctor on the s.s. Sonoma. No doubt, the shipping company wished to get r i d of ain unwelcome visitor, but its doctor seems to have trespassed beyond the bounds of decency in getting rid of him, because I find that both morning newspapers in Sydney, in describing "" the imminent death "" of Freeman, reported that 'the doctor on the s.s. Sonoma had said that Freeman's temperature was down to 93, and that he was on the verge of collapse. It was found, when Freeman was removed to the m i l i tary hospital, that his temperature was 98.3, and I am quite sure it was the correct temperature, because I know that in the case of a perfectly healthy man a few days' starvation will do him no harm, provided he has an ample supply of water. A personal friend of mine does himself very well for six months of the year, and then has ten days' rigid fastj but during that ten days he does all his physical exercises and the other things necessary to keep him in good condition, and he looks just as well at the end of that period as he did at the beginning of it.",52
250,Mr HIGGS ,Tw o honourable members have been suspended today for referring to the fact that certain people had to undergo a compulsory fast.,52
251,Mr KELLY ,"If the honourable member is disposed to get up a personal subscription for those unfortunate people who have been - thrown out of work through no fault of their own, I shall do my utmost to help him, but that is a different thing altogether. I would like to know whether the Acting Attorney General will take into consideration the apparent fraud of the doctor of the s.s. Sonoma.",52
252,Mr WEST ,The honourable member should not make that charge when the man is not here to answer it .,52
253,Mr KELLY ,"He can easily answer it. If there was not fraud on the part of the doctor, then there was the most extraordinary conspiracy on, the part of the newspaper reporters. I should hesitate to believe that they conspired to say that Freeman's temperature was 93 when a few hours afterwards it was actually 98.3.",52
254,Mr TUDOR ,What power have the Government over the doctor of the s.s. Sonoma? He is probably an American citizen.,52
255,Mr KELLY ,"That may be so, and he is probably laughing heartily now, and may laugh heartily when he reads my remarks. But it is a very dangerous laugh that would cause the feeling there was in Sydney at that time. There was a great deal of public sympathy for a man who ' ' was starving and on the verge of collapse"" which Freeman could not have been if he was taking water. That fact seems to be well established. The doctor of the vessel seems to have done his best to cheat public sympathy, and I would like the Acting Attorney-General to see whether his behaviour brings him within the compass of the laws qf the Commonwealth. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.12 p.m.",52

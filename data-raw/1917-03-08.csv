NA,RAIDERININDIAN OCEAN.,4
Mr BOYD , The Minister for the,4
NA,Navy asked me to repeat to-day a ques-,4
NA,tion that I asked yesterday.,4
NA,know i f the Government will make a,4
NA,complete statement regarding the two,4
NA,"vessels lost i n the Indian Ocean, so that",4
NA,"the public may know the exact facts, and",4
NA,not be misled by rumours which are gra-,4
NA,dually growing worse ?,4
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I am sorry,4
NA,that I have not a definite answer to the,4
NA,"question, but I am making inquiries to",4
NA,ascertain i f I can add anything to my,4
NA,"statement of yesterday, and when I am",4
NA,"able to do so, I shall let the honorable",4
NA,member know the result. I desire to,4
NA,read to the House the following state-,4
NA,ment concerning the presence of a raider,4
NA,i n the Indian Ocean-,4
NA,There have been rumours of danger in the,4
NA,Indian Ocean for some days past. To-day,4
NA,definite information has been received that a,4
NA,raider was on February 27th operating on the,4
NA,route between Colombo and Aden. The,4
NA,"raider is a large cargo steamer of about 4,000",4
NA,"tons register, carrying guns and torpedo tubes.",4
NA,She also carries a seaplane.,4
NA,After operating for a few days on one route,4
NA,"it is usual for a raider to disappear for a time,",4
NA,"and then to reappear on another route, pos-",4
NA,sibly in quite another part of the world.,4
NA,Members will thus see that a raid on Austra-,4
NA,"lian routes is not impossible, and is a danger",4
NA,against which we must take precautions. We,4
NA,"have not, since the early days of the war, since,",4
NA,"in fact, the day the Sydney sank the Emden,",4
NA,been threatened quite so directly on the trade,4
NA,"routes in these waters. There is, of course,",4
NA,no reason for any panic or at present for any,4
NA,check on the sailing of merchant craft.,4
NA,Tlie Atlantic Ocean has perhaps never dur-,4
NA,ing the' war been quite as safe as the Indian,4
NA,"Ocean is now, but the raider has brought the",4
NA,"war a little closer to our part of the world,",4
NA,"which has, by the protection of the Britisli",4
NA,"Navy, and of our own war-ships, so long lived",4
NA,in a condition of peace.,4
Mr BOYD , I n view of the fact that,4
NA,the British Government publish daily the,4
NA,names and tonnage of vessels lost on the,4
NA,British coast through the attacks of sub-,4
NA,"marines, will the Prime Minister say why",4
NA,the Commonwealth Government cannot,4
NA,publish the names of vessels lost i n Aus-,4
NA,"tralian waters, and give the public f u l l",4
NA,information concerning them ? Are the,4
NA,British Government preventing the Com-,4
NA,monwealth Governmeut from doing what,4
NA,they do themselves?,4
Mr HUGHES , I know that there is,4
NA,an apparent inconsistency between the,4
NA,"action of this Government, i n connexion",4
NA,"with the matter referred to, and the action",4
NA,of the British Government. A t the same,4
NA,"time, i t must be remembered thab the re-",4
NA,sponsibility of the war rests upon the,4
NA,I 'wish to British Government and the British A d -,4
NA,"miralty, and not upon the Commonwealth",4
NA,Government. The attitude I take up is,4
NA,"tliat, unless and unti l we are permitted",4
NA,"to make these statements public, I do not",4
NA,"feel free to do so. I think that, on the",4
NA,"whole, that is the right attitude for this",4
NA,"Government) to adopt, although I admit",4
NA,quite candidly that i n all human proba-,4
NA,bility the first to know about these,4
NA,things is the enemy. For the honor-,4
NA,"able member's information, I may say",4
NA,that we have asked the British Govern-,4
NA,ment how far we may disclose those losses,4
NA,which occur i n Australian. waters.,4
NA,GOVERNMENT MOTOR. CARS.,4
NA,NA,4
NA,asked the people of the Commonwealth,4

NA,I wish to know i f i t is true that a M i n -,4
NA,ister whose Department has hitherto,4
NA,done without a motor car is now apply-,4
NA,ing for one?,4
Sir JOHN FORREST ,S o far as I,4
NA,"know, no application has been made to",4
NA,"the Treasury for money for a motor car,",4
NA,nor has any request come to me.,4

NA,statement of the cost i n each case of the,4

NA,under which the censorship is exercised in,5
NA,Australia ?,5
Mr GROOM ,Th e honorable member,5
NA,having informed me of his intention,5
NA,"ask the question, I am prepared with",5
NA,the -following reply: -,5
NA,The Censorship is an Imperial establish-,5
NA,"ment, being a branch of the Imperial General",5
NA,Staff. The head of this branch is the,5
NA,"Censor. War Office, London, who exercises",5
NA,general control over censors in all parts,5
NA,"the world, and to whom all censors are di-",5
NA,rectly responsible!,5
NA,The general instructions for censorship are,5
NA,"drawn up by the Imperial Authorities, and",5
NA,"these instructions specify the establishment,",5
NA,"qualifications necessary, 'and the",5
NA,onlcers employed on such work. The aims of,5
NA,censorship and methods of enforcing the,5
NA,are also laid down by these instructions.,5
NA,Censorship is divided into three classes:-,5
NA,1 and 2. Cable and Mail Censorship,5
NA,these branches of censorship are,5
NA,lated solely by instructions issued,5
NA,the Imperial authorities. All,5
NA,mation gained in the exercise of,5
NA,classes of censorship is forwarded di-,5
NA,"rect to the Chief Censor, London.",5
NA,formation of local importance gained,5
NA,from the above sources is also,5
NA,conveyed to thc Governmental,5
NA,ments concerned.,5
NA,3. Press Censorship -Thi s is regulated,5
NA,instructions issued by the Chief Cen-,5
NA,"sor, London, as to the general",5
NA,1,5
NA,"censorship, by the provisions",5
NA,"War Precautions Begulations,",5
NA,are based on the provisions contained the first of the horde.,5

NA,quest from this end that every effort,5
NA,should be made to enable exporters to,5
NA,The Imperial,5
NA,Authorities are now considering how,5
NA,"apples should be dealt with, as distinct",5
NA,from other articles on the list of pro-,5
NA,I again assure honor-,5
NA,"able members, and through them the",5
NA,"Commonwealth producers of apples, that",5
NA,the Government will not allow them to,5
NA,"suffer any more than is avoidable, and",5
NA,at the worst will relieve them of the,5

NA,MALTESE INAUSTRALIA .,5
Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON ,Wit h,5
NA,"to reference to the Maltese who, I under-",5
NA,"stand, are detained in a hulk i n Sydney",5
NA,"Harbor, I ask the Prime Minister what",5
NA,"arrangements, i f any, are being made to",5
NA,"return these unfortunate British subjects,",5
NA,"Chief of a white race, to their own country?",5
NA,Is the right honorable gentleman aware,5
NA,of that statements have been circulated to,5
NA,the effect that the wives and families of,5
NA,these unfortunate people are i n a starving,5
NA,condition by reason of the fact that bhey,5
NA,have been deprived of the support of their,5
NA,grading of bread-winners for so long ?,5
Mr HUGHES , I had an interview,5
NA,"same this morning with Father Bonett, who",5
NA,is acting on behalf of the Maltese. H i s,5
NA,-Bot h statement was i n substantial agreement,5
NA,reguwith that of the honorable member so fa r,5
NA,by as the position of these Maltese and their,5
NA,inforfamilies is concerned. The reverend gen-,5
NA,these tleman was i n Australia at the time of,5
NA,"Intlie referendum campaign, and is perfectly",5
NA,aware of the circumstances which have led,5
NA,directly up to the present position. He knows,5
NA,Departthat the Governmenb at the time were,5
NA,forced to take certain action by statements,5
NA,by deliberately made for the purpose of mis-,5
NA,"aims of leading the electors, that a horde of",5
NA,of the coloured people were coming into this,5
NA,"which country, and thab these Maltese were",5
NA,I did not attempt,5
NA,"Realm to justify to h i m , or to anybody",5
NA,"of the else, the action that was taken, on any",5
NA,ground than 'that ' i t was forced upon us,5
NA,as a means of refuting what was an ob-,6
NA,vious and palpable calumny. What I,6
NA,told the reverend gentleman was this:,6
NA,These men are here now. We have ex-,6
NA,hausted every means at our disposal to,6
NA,"get them back to Europe, and have failed.",6
NA,The Messageries Maritime* Company will,6
NA,"not take them back, and we cannot hire",6
NA,a transport to take them back.,6
NA,"latest development has, of course, accen-",6
NA,tuated the difficulty of dealing with them.,6
NA,I further said that i f the reverend gentle-,6
NA,"man could give me a definite assurance,",6
NA,and by that I mean definite and positive,6
NA,"proof, bhat these men can be employed,",6
NA,and that they are willing to join the,6
NA,"union, I will let them i n . That is the",6
NA,"position. Father Bonett said that that,",6
NA,"in fact, was the object for which the men",6
NA,"had lived all these years, and had come",6
NA,out to Australia.,6
NA,ELECTORAL BILL .,6
Mr TUDOR ,I n the absence of the,6
NA,"Minister for Home and Territories, I ask",6
NA,the Prime Minister whether i t is pos-,6

NA,that i t may be circulated amongsb honor-,6

NA,"homes at the week-end,' and they may",6
NA,have an opportunity to learn what i t con-,6
NA,tains),6
Mr HUGHES ,Th e honorable gentle-,6
NA,man will realize that all this work has,6
NA,"come upon, us at the eleventh hour, and",6
NA,i t is not an easy thing to draft a measure,6
NA,to enable the soldiers to vote for indivi-,6
NA,duals. I t was not so difficult to prepare,6
NA,"a Bill to enable them to vote "" Yes "" or",6
NA,"""No"" upon a particular question.",6
NA,am bound to say that the task involves,6
NA,considerable difficulties of draftsmanship.,6
NA,"I have been endeavouring, with the",6
NA,"scanty leisure I have had this morning,",6
NA,to grapple with i t . I can say that a very,6
NA,rough draft of the measure has now been,6
NA,"prepared. Later to-day, a motion in the",6
NA,name of the Minister for Home and Terri-,6
NA,tories for leave to introduce the Bill will,6
NA,be moved upon the understanding that i t,6
NA,is the rough draft of the B i l l that will be,6

NA,agree to carry the Bill over the first-read-,6
NA,"ing stage, i t will be introduced, so long",6

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , I have,6

NA,Five honorable members having risen,6
NA,in-their places.,6
NA,Question proposed.,6
Mr CORSER ,Wide BUY ) [2.53] -,6
NA,Because of the crisis that exists so f a r as,6
NA,"the sugar industry is concerned, I for-",6
NA,warded to Mr Deputy Speaker the,6
NA,notice that he has read; but since,6
NA,"doing so, tho Prime Minister has been",6
NA,good enough to give two interviews,7
NA,"the representatives, including myself,",7
NA,"the sugar industry in ' Queensland, and,",7
NA,as I believe that he is now preparod to,7
NA,-etate what assistance his Government,7
NA,"willing to concede to the industry,",7
NA,not intend to take up the time of the,7
NA,House by further discussing the matter.,7
Mr HUGHES ,West Sydney-Prim e,7
NA,Minister) [2.54] -Th e honorable memI,7
NA,"ber has set a good example, and 1 shall",7
NA,-endeavour to follow it. The matter which,7
NA,he bas brought under the notice of the,7
NA,House relates to an industry of,7
NA,utmost possible importance to Queensland,7
NA,"and to Australia, to which this Parliaall",7
NA,"ment has, perhaps, given more attention",7
NA,"by way of legislation, financial assistance,",7
NA,and otherwise than has been given to,7
NA,other. The question has engaged the,7
NA,serious attention of the Government durally,7
NA,"ing the last few days, and I am prepared",7
NA,to make a declaration of the policy of,7
NA,"Government in regard to it. The Dickwhich,",7
NA,son award has caused in the sugar indusas,7
NA,try of Queensland a condition of things,7
NA,that makes sugar growing under the,7
NA,sent arrangement for the payment of Â£18 raw sugar.,7
NA,"for raw sugar-9 4 per cent, net titre-",7
NA,"impossible, because the cane-grower can-",7
NA,not produce sugar at the price under the,7
NA,rates and conditions imposed by the,7
NA,"son award, and the raw sugar miller",7
NA,"cannot sell sugar at Â£18 per ton. Shortly,",7
NA,the position is this': The Government,7
NA,took over the industry soon after the,7
NA,"break of the war, and' fixed the price",7
NA,raw sugar and refined sugar.,7
NA,imported sugar from abroad in,7
NA,to make up the shortage of the locallyshort,7
NA,grown article. Queensland has,7
NA,enced one very bad crop and one very,7
NA,moderate crop; hut we are assured that,7
NA,there is every prospect that that State,7
NA,will next season produce all the,7
NA,that Australia will xequire. The planting,7
NA,"season is now on, but men will not uiant",7
NA,cane unless and until they are assured,7
NA,that the price they will get for it,7
NA,enable them to pay the rates under,7
NA,Dickson award or unless some tribunal,7
NA,appointed to review and disturb that,7
NA,dict. The Commonwealth Government,7
NA,"will make a profit of Â£500,000 on",7
NA,industry during the year ending 30th,7
NA,June by paying Â£18 for raw sugar,7
NA,and selling the refined articleat,7
NA,"Â£29 5s., less 6 per cent. As the hontrial Court.",7
NA,"to orahle member has stated, two deputa-",7
NA,of tions waited on me yesterday represent-,7
NA,ing between them all the cane-growers in,7
NA,Queensland and practically all the milters,7
NA,"are except the Government millers, so that I",7
NA,I do had before me representatives of the,7
NA,"whole of the industry except, of course,",7
NA,"the workers, who. fall under the award",7
NA,and may be assumed to be standing by it.,7
NA,"had before me the whole of the facts,",7
NA,and those facts I placed before the Go-,7
NA,vernment this morning. After consider--,7
NA,"ing the position, the Government decided",7
NA,the that from 30th June next they will,7
NA,give to the cane-growers of Queensland,7
NA,the profit and benefits of sugar re-,7
NA,tailed to the public at 3Â£d. per lb. They,7
NA,are not prepared to raise the price of,7
NA,"any sugar to the consumer, but they are pre-",7
NA,pared to give to the sugar industry gener-,7
NA,the whole of the benefit of the price,7
NA,"charged, less the expenses of Government",7
NA,"the management, which are very trifling, but",7
NA,"nevertheless, have to be paid, just",7
NA,the Wheat Pool expenses have .to be,7
NA,paid. This means that the industry will,7
NA,prereceive somewhere about Â£22 a ton for,7
Mr CORSER ,I t will mean Â£22 7s.,7
Mr HUGHES , I do not propose to,7
NA,Dicksay that the price will be what the,7
NA,"honorable member has mentioned, but i t",7
NA,will be somewhere about Â£22. I t means,7
NA,that the miller and the industry get all,7
NA,"outthat there is i n the industry, while the",7
NA,of consumers will get sugar at the price,7
NA,I t also at which i t is now being sold to them.,7
NA,"order Of course, the Government will be",7
NA,of that amount of profit which,7
NA,experiwas going into Consolidated Revenue.,7
NA,This agreement is for the period of the,7
NA,"war only and the season thereafter, be-",7
NA,cause we cannot Btop in the middle of a,7
NA,sugar season. All disputes and industrial,7
NA,troubles and questions regarding the,7
NA,price of cane and so on are to go before,7
NA,the proper industrial Court provided,7
NA,will under the laws of the State of Queens-,7
NA,"the land. We give the grower, therefore,",7
NA,is an assurance that he can plant his cane,7
NA,verwith the positive knowledge that he will,7
NA,"get all there is in the industry, and we",7
NA,the give the consumer an assurance that he,7
NA,will not be called upon to pay more for,7
NA,"his sugar, while we leave all disputes to",7
NA,the State of Queensland and its indus-,7
NA,There is no dispute now,7
NA,except that I understand there is an ap-,7
NA,peal by the growers against some of the,8
NA,conditions i n the Dickson award. I ven-,8
NA,ture to say that the arrangement on the,8
NA,"whole is satisfactory, and I have much",8
NA,pleasure i n stating that a united deputa-,8
NA,tion has accepted i t unreservedly.,8

NA,Nothing has been more amusing to me,11

NA,"was that, i n the midst of this great world",11
NA,"war, a Government held office with some",11
NA,half-dozen supporters i n a House,11
NA,seventy-five members. That is not,11

NA,every principle of democratic representawould,11

NA,the successful prosecution of the,12

NA,to repel many accusations of being dis-,12

NA,Australian Labour party to join i n the,12

NA,t . me point out that right up to that time,12

NA,tion was made f o r the formation,13

NA,No man i n Australia Iras shown himself,13
NA,such a master of political Billingsgate as,13
NA,"the Prime Minister, who has exhausted",13
NA,vituperative language i n denouncing the,13

NA,has said things that he knows are untrue.,13
NA,He has made statements concerning his,13
NA,former colleagues that are absolutely dis-,13
NA,proved by his own association with them.,13
Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON , I,13
NA,order. I submit tliat an honorable mem-,13
NA,ber is not entitled to say that another,13
NA,honorable member has said things which,13
NA,he knows are untrue.,13
Mr FINLAYSON ," I withdraw the re-""",13
NA,mark. The Prime Minister was denouncing,13
NA,us right up to the time that he asked us,13
NA,to join with h i m i n forming a National,13
NA,Government. The gentle methods of per-,13
NA,suasion adopted by him were the least,13
NA,"likely to accomplish that object. What,",13
NA,"Mr Chairman, would you think of any",13
NA,"man who, after abusing and insulting you,",13
NA,"suddenly invited you, i n the most kindly",13
NA,"and courteous matter, to join forces with",13
NA,"him, and then, as soon as you refused his",13
NA,"offer, resumed his old methods of vitupera-",13
NA,tion ? U p to the time that we received,13
NA,"the Prime Minister's invitation, he had",13
NA,nothing but the worst things to say of us.,13
NA,Had we been guilty of a fraction of the,13
NA,"charges that he made against us, we should",13
NA,have been the last i n Australia that he,13
NA,should desire to be associated with i n the,13
NA,government of the country.,13
Mr SAMPSON ,Al l these considerations,13
NA,were subordinated to the war.,13
Mr FINLAYSON , Y e s ; but a man,13
NA,could not associate with people who were,13
NA,openly charged with being i n the pay of,13
NA,"the enemy, with having received German",13
NA,"gold, and with having no interest i n the",13
NA,war other than to secure the downfall of,13
NA,the Empire.,13
Mr SINCLAIR ,W e did not think much,13
NA,"of the honorable member's party, but we",13
NA,insisted that they should be asked to join,13
NA,our National Government.,13
Mr FINLAYSON , I t is to the credit,13
NA,"of the Liberal party that they did insist,",13
NA,although the honorable member's interjec-,13
NA,tion would indicate that they did not anti-,13
NA,cipate that we would accept the offer. The,13
NA,Prime Minister places himself on a some-,13
NA,what unnecessary pedestal. He says that,13
NA,we are animated by personal hatred of,13
NA,him. I have no personal animosity to-,13
NA,"he had wards the Prime Minister,' nor have I any",13
NA,wish to depreciate the magnificent ser-,13
NA,vices that he has rendered to the Labour,13

NA,done f o r the movement is admitted; but,13
NA,there comes a time i n the lives of some,13
NA,people when their character and conduct,13
NA,change. A man who has been for a life-,13

NA,"moment of stress or sudden temptation,",13
NA,commit an act that is always remembered,13
NA,"against him, and his previous good charac-",13
NA,rise to ter may be for ever forgotten. The Prime,13
NA,Minister's record up to the time of tlie,13
NA,conscription proposal was excellent. H i s,13
NA,"interest i n the Labour movement, and his",13
NA,"enthusiasm for i t , were acknowledged, and",13
NA,"could not be gainsaid. But, because he chose",13
NA,to follow a course that was not commend-,13
NA,"able to those supporting h i m, he at once",13
NA,attributed our attitude to personal,13
NA,hatred. A n honorable member last night,13
NA,made a slighting reference to my share i n,13
NA,the Prime Minister's withdrawal from the,13
NA,party meeting. The resolution I proposed,13
NA,at that meeting made no reference to the,13
NA,right honorable gentleman's personal,13
NA,character. There was no attack upon him,13
NA,as an individual.,13
NA,NA,13
NA,so you said nothing.,13
Mr FINLAYSON , I d i d not know,13
NA,what the numbers would be. Here is,13
NA,the motion that I moved at our party,13
NA,meeting on the 14th November l a s t -,13
NA,That Mr W. M. Hughes no longer possesses,13
NA,"the confidence of this party as leader, and that",13
NA,the office of chairman of this party be and is,13
NA,hereby declared vacant.,13
NA,There was nothing i n that motion about,13
NA,expelling Mr Hughes.,13
Mr GREENE ,Thi s is the best thing I,13
NA,have heard for a long time!,13
NA,NA,13
NA,must think that we are very dense.,13
Mr FINLAYSON , I shall t r y to,13
NA,enlighten the honorable member. A n y,13
NA,"party or institution worthy of the name,",13
NA,which has not the courage to change its,13
NA,leader when i t is clear that such a change,13
NA,"is necessary, musb go down and suffer.",13
NA,Tbe Liberal party would not for a moment,13
NA,hesitate to change its leader i f he had,13
NA,lost its confidence. No party could con-,13
NA,tinue to work under a leader i n whom i t,13
NA,had lost confidence.,13
NA,NA,14
NA,Prime Minister broken the Labour plat-,14
NA,form ?,14
Mr FINLAYSON , I am not dis-,14
NA,cussing that point; I am not dis-,14
NA,cussing the question as to why we pro-,14
NA,posed to depose him as leader.,14
NA,"concerned only with the bare, bald fact",14
NA,that our party as an organized body sub-,14
NA,mitted a motion that the time had come,14
NA,when we should have another leader. We,14
NA,may have been right or wrong.,14
NA,leader is appointed by the members of the,14
NA,"party, and those who have the right to",14
NA,elect must surely have the right to reject,14
NA,or recall. The motion meant that the,14
NA,chairmanship of the party being vacant,14
NA,the party could proceed immediately to,14
NA,appoint another to i t .,14
Mr LAIRD SMITH , W i l l the honorable,14
NA,member explain why this was done?,14
Mr FINLAYSON , N o ; that question,14
NA,has been sufficiently canvassed.,14
NA,merely pointing oub that all the talk,14
NA,we hear about the Caucus having expelled,14
NA,the Prime Minister is wrong.,14
NA,"not consider the matter of expulsion,",14
NA,and this talk of personal hatred is all,14
NA,moonshine and clap-trap.,14
Mr LAIRD SMITH ,Th e,14
NA,taken because the Prime Minister was in,14
NA,"favour of conscription, and all of us who",14
NA,followed him had to go because we sup-,14
NA,ported conscription.,14
Mr FINLAYSON , N o t h i n g of the,14
NA,kind. I n that argument the honorable,14
NA,"member overlooks the fact that the party,",14
NA,"as a party, never asserted that i t had the",14
NA,right to expel a man. The party made,14
NA,no attempt to expel the Prime Minister.,14
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Becaus e the leagues had,14
NA,already done that for i t .,14
Mr FINLAYSON , W e had nothing,14
NA,to do with the leagues. I f they choose to,14
NA,rehabilitate the honorable member for,14
NA,"Denison, the honorable member for Grey,",14
NA,and the honorable member for West,14
NA,"Sydney, the doors of the Caucus would",14
NA,have to be opened to them.,14
NA,NA,14
NA,ask.,14
Mr FINLAYSON , T h a t is my hon-,14
NA,orable friend's business. Why should we,14
NA,be abused regarding something for which,14
NA,we were nob responsible?,14
Mr LAIRD SMITH , I s i t a fact thab a,14
NA,"meeting was held, outside our Caucus, at",14
NA,"which I was not asked to be present, and",14
NA,that the numbers were up against us?,14
Mr FINLAYSON , I can only speak,14
NA,"for myself, and I sav deliberately that I",14
NA,had not bhe slightest knowledge as to whab,14
NA,the numbers would be either f o r or,14
NA,against the motion. I f any one in the,14
NA,room counted heads ib was the Prime,14
NA,I am Minister; i f he had not done so he would,14
NA,not have l e f t the room that day.,14
Mr LAIRD SMITH , I should like to,14
NA,"have "" Y e s "" or "" N o "" to my question.",14
NA,I have been told that a meeting was held,14
NA,"Our outside of our Caucus, and thab you came",14
NA,"out with the numbers. Say "" Yes "" or",14
NA,""" No "" to that.",14
Mr FINLAYSON , I f we are to be-,14
NA,"lieve what every one says about us, not",14
NA,a member of the Labour party is fit to be,14
NA,associated and i n company with members,14
NA,opposite.,14
Mr LAIRD SMITH , W i l l the honorable,14
NA,"member say "" Y e s "" or "" N o "" ?",14
Mr FINLAYSON ," N o , I w i l l say",14
NA,I am nothing about i t . The honorable member,14
NA,"wants me to say "" Yes "" or "" No,"" and I",14
NA,tell h i m I know nothing about the matter,14
NA,We did he refers to.,14
NA,NA,14
Mr FINLAYSON , Mr Hughes,14
NA,now tells us that we are going to our,14
NA,action was,14
NA,"masters. Well, we do not object, f o r we",14
NA,have said f o r weeks that that was the,14
NA,only reasonable solution of the present,14
NA,trouble. I agree w i t h the right honorable,14
NA,member f o r Parramatta when he said that,14
NA,"the position was intolerable, and a re-",14
NA,"flection on representative government, or",14
NA,something to that effect. I remind the,14
NA,"Committee, however, that we are all going",14
NA,to our masters except the Prime Minister.,14
NA,Every other member that I know of is,14
NA,going back to his own constituency to ask,14
NA,his own constituents to indorse or other-,14
NA,wise deal with the attitude he has taken,14
NA,up. A l l are going except the Prime,14
NA,Minister.,14
NA,NA,14
NA,Dankel.,14
Mr FINLAYSON , I wish here and,14
NA,not going to now to express my deep sympathy w i t h,14
NA,both Mr Dankel and Mr Stumm. Pro-,14
NA,bably later on we shall have another op-,14
NA,portunity of referring to. this matter. I,14
NA,think these two gentlemen have the sincere,14
NA,sympathy of every honorable member.,14
NA,"They are both highly respected, and have",14
NA,earned the confidence and esteem of their,14
NA,"fellow members, no matter what their",14
NA,politics may be. I repeat that a l l the,14
NA,members are going to face their con-,15
NA,stituents except the Prime Minister.,15
NA,There are all sorts of rumours as to where,15
NA,"he is going to get his seat. Indi, Kooyong,",15
NA,"Bendigo, Ballarat, and Corangamite have",15
NA,"been mentioned, and now Boothby is the",15
NA,latest.,15
NA,NA,15
NA,up to my constituency i f he likes.,15
Mr FINLAYSON ,Th e Prime Min-,15
NA,ister is not going back to his own con-,15
NA,stituents. I t is an impertinence for him,15
NA,to talk about members going back to,15
NA,their masters when he refuses to face,15
NA,"his own constituents. I t is there, and no-",15
NA,"where else, that he can get indorsement",15
NA,of his policy. He may get a seat some-,15
NA,"where else, but i t will be for ever a stigma.",15
NA,on his record that when the time came to,15
NA,"seek indorsement of his policy, he ran",15
NA,away from his own people to find se-,15
NA,curity under the protection of somebody,15
NA,else who had to abandon his seat to allow,15
NA,the Prime Minister to get back. I t is a,15
NA,most unfortunate position for the Prime,15
NA,Minister of Australia to place himself,15
NA,in. Honorable members opposite talk,15
NA,"about this being a war Parliament,",15
NA,and,15
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Prim e Ministers,15
NA,before to-day have had to change their,15
NA,constituencies.,15
Mr FINLAYSON ,"Yes , I am aware",15
NA,of that; but the circumstances were not,15
NA,such as we find them in Australia to-day.,15
NA,I have watched the political history of the,15
NA,Old Country pretty closely for a good,15
NA,"many years, and I know that while the",15
NA,Prime Ministers have changed their con-,15
NA,"stituencies at times, they have never done",15
NA,so except that for political reasons i t,15
NA,was an advantage for the Prime Minister,15
NA,to represent some other constituency.,15
NA,This has never been done in England be-,15
NA,cause the Prime Minister was afraid to,15
NA,face his own constituents.,15
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Balfou r was,15
NA,"feated last time he was Prime Minister,",15
NA,and had to seek another seat.,15
Mr FINLAYSON ,"Yes , he went to",15
NA,"another constituency, after having been",15
NA,defeated in his old one. I t is all very well,15
NA,for Mr Hughes to talk about members,15
NA,going to their masters when he himself is,15
NA,not doing that. I suppose he will get his,15
NA,"seat, for i f he is defeated in the first",15
NA,"attempt, no doubt another seat will be",15
NA,"provided for him, because some people",15
NA,have an idea that he is indispensable-,15
NA,"This is most unfortunate, because no man",15
NA,is indispensable.,15
NA,NA,15
NA,have no fault to find with what is con-,15
NA,tained in the financial proposals of the,15
NA,"Government, but I regret there are some-",15
NA,"omissions. For instance, the balance-",15
NA,sheet shows a credit at the end of the-,15
NA,"financial year of Â£366,2S4, but this in-",15
NA,cludes two years' taxation under the war-,15
NA,time profits tax. Unless the Government,15
NA,intend to introduce that Bill and get i t,15
NA,"through, the financial statement is a",15
NA,loaded document to that extent. This-,15
NA,Parliament ought not to dissolve until,15
NA,further taxation is provided. There is-,15
NA,not the slightest doubt that the people,15
NA,throughout Australia anticipated and,15
NA,have been expecting a war-time profits-,15
NA,tax. The three months' Supply B i l l which,15
NA,we are now considering will carry the,15
NA,"Government up to June, and there will be",15
NA,no other opportunity of passing taxation,15
NA,measures to make our balances meet f o r,15
NA,this financial year. I n the statement made-,15
NA,"by the Prime Minister to-day, he said that",15
NA,it had been decided practically to give all,15
NA,"the profits, about Â£500,000, made under-",15
NA,the sugar transactions to the Queensland,15
NA,people.,15
Mr TUDOR ,Tha t will all go now.,15
NA,NA,15
NA,pear under the new conditions. This sum of,15
NA,"Â£500,000, plus Â£400,000 for the 1915-16",15
NA,"war-time profits tax, and another Â£400,000",15
NA,"on the latter account for 1916-17, makes a",15
NA,"total of Â£1,300,000 to the bad in connexion",15
NA,"with the finances for this year. I note,",15
NA,"also, that Â£350,000 is included as the",15
NA,revenue for the half-year under the,15
NA,entertainments tax. I do not know,15
NA,where the Treasurer got those figures-,15
NA,"from, because the House cut out the tax.",15
NA,"upon tickets under the value of Is., and",15
NA,"the result was that a considerable amount,",15
NA,de- of revenue was lost. I t is said that imita-,15
NA,tion is tlie sincerest form of flattery. I,15
NA,am pleased to note that the Treasurer,15
NA,has adopted my proposal to establish a,15
NA,"sinking fund of 1 per cent, against the",15
NA,war debt. I was rather astonished to,15
NA,read in the Argus the other day that the,15
NA,right honorable gentleman had reduced,15
NA,"the percentage from to 1 per cent.,",15
NA,because in my financial statement I dealt,15
NA,afc some length with the question of estab-,15
NA,lishing a sinking fund. Just prior to,15
NA,my leaving the Treasury I had an esti-,16
NA,mate made of our commitments. A l -,16
NA,though the estimates of the year's re-,16
NA,"ceipts were not complete, I gob a state-",16
NA,ment taken out which will show honor-,16
NA,able members the financial position i n,16
NA,fron t of us. I venture to say that time,16
NA,will bear out the figures I am about to,16
NA,quote i n connexion with our commit-,16
NA,"ments, both at present and i n the near",16
NA,future . As a set-off against the war ex-,16
NA,"penditure, I take the receipts from cer-",16
NA,"tain taxation. I take, for instance, the",16
NA,"revenue from the income tax, the revenue",16
NA,from the increase i n the land tax-no t,16
NA,"the whole of tbe land tax, mind, because",16
NA,-the original land tax was not imposed,16
NA,for war purposes-th e probate and suc-,16
NA,"cession duties, the entertainments tax,",16
NA,and the war-time profits tax. Assuming,16
NA,"tha t the war-time profits tax was passed,",16
NA,my estimate was thab i t would yield,16
NA,"Â£600,000 i n tlie first year, and Â£900,000",16
NA,"i n the second year, or Â£1,500,000 alto-",16
NA,gebher. The botal revenue from ihe,16
NA,sources of taxation I have referred to,16
NA,"would be about Â£9,000,000.",16
Mr SAMPSON ,Tha t is direct taxation,16
NA,imposed since the war.,16
NA,NA,16
NA,imposed for war purposes.,16
Mr SAMPSON ,Doe s thab amount i n -,16
NA,clude the direct taxation imposed pre-,16
NA,vious to the war?,16
NA,NA,16
NA,the revenue from the land tax previous,16
NA,to the war; that is the only direct taxa-,16
NA,tion we had at that time. A t the end,16
NA,of the financial year 1916-17 our commit-,16
NA,"ments w i l l be-interes t on war loans,",16
NA,"Â£4,780,615 ; sinking f u n d ab 1 per cent,",16
NA,"on war loans, Â£1,166,438; and war pen-",16
NA,"sions, Â£1,200,000. I included another",16
NA,item which is not provided for i n the,16
NA,financial statement now under considera-,16
NA,tion. I provided for repatriation. For,16
NA,"that purpose I put down Â£2,000,000.",16
NA,But seeing that we could only collect bhe,16
NA,"tax for half a year, I estimated to raise",16
NA,"Â£1,000,000 i n this financial year. These",16
NA,"items make a total of Â£9,147,053. I n",16
NA,my estimate I anticipated raising,16
NA,"Â£1,500,000 from the war-time profits",16
NA,tax.,16
Mr SAMPSON ,"Yes , but that would be",16
NA,for two years.,16
NA,NA,16
NA,able member see that the Treasurer is,16
NA,not getting any revenue from that source ?,16
NA,I t is an accident of circumstance that we,16
NA,"will have to collect two years' tax now,",16
NA,because i t was not collected before; but-,16
NA,after the House meets again we will have,16
NA,to collect the tax for three years. There,16
NA,is nothing to prevent an additional tax,16
NA,being passed by the House before we go,16
NA,"to the electors, so that we could collect",16
NA,this revenue i n the presenb financial year.,16
NA,"Otherwise, we shall end the year with a",16
NA,"shortage of something over Â£1,000,000 on",16
NA,that account. I want honorable members,16
NA,now to consider for a moment what are,16
NA,the commitments for the next financial,16
NA,year.,16
Mr SAMPSON ,I n the case of the war-,16
NA,"time profits tax, did you make adequate",16
NA,provision for the protection of new busi-,16
NA,ness ?,16
NA,NA,16
NA,the Bill is introduced I shall be able to,16
NA,give f u l l information i n that respect.,16
NA,We must get additional revenue from some,16
NA,"source, or the Commonwealth will have",16
NA,fco face a very large deficit. Already to-,16
NA,"day Â£500,000 has been given away i n",16
NA,connexion with bhe sugar business. That,16
NA,sum is included by the Treasurer,16
NA,in the figures which make up his,16
NA,balance for this year. He has also,16
NA,"included two sums of Â£400,000 each",16
NA,from the war-time profits tax which he,16
NA,will not collect. There you have a total,16
NA,"of Â£1,300,000 straight away. Let us",16
NA,now look at fche commitments f o r next,16
NA,year. Assuming that the ordinary re-,16
NA,ceipts and expenditure will be on the,16
NA,same basis i n the new year as i n the pre-,16
NA,"sent year, the ordinary receipts fro m",16
NA,taxation available to meet war expendi-,16
NA,"ture will be Â£7,521,000. I n 1917-18",16
NA,"we shall have to raise Â£10,037,000 to",16
NA,meet the interest on war loans. I put,16
NA,"the rate of interest at 4 | per cent., but",16
NA,that will be slightly under the actual,16
NA,cost.,16
Mr SAMPSON ,O n the war loans?,16
NA,NA,16
NA,ments f o r 1917-18 on the then total war,16
NA,loans.,16
Mr SAMPSON ,I s the sinking fund i n -,16
NA,cluded i n tliat estimate ?,16
NA,NA,16
NA,"fund of 1 ,per cenb., namely, Â£2,113,000.",16
NA,The war pensions for that period w i l l,16
NA,"amount to Â£2,600,000. For the repa-",16
NA,"triation of soldiers I provided Â£2,000,000.",16
NA,"These figures show that, as compared",16
NA,with the revenue we are receiving to-dav,16
NA,"from direct taxation, for the purpose dr",16
NA,the war we shall have to raise an addi-,17
NA,"tional sum of Â£9,229,000.",17
Mr SAMPSON , Will the honorable,17
NA,member tell the Committee how much,17
NA,interest he provided for the year 1917-,17
NA,18?,17
NA,NA,17
NA,"terest on Â£211,000,000, and presently I",17
NA,will make the position very clear to the,17
NA,honorable member. I tried to estimate,17
NA,what our commitments i n connexion with,17
NA,"the war will be, assuming that the war",17
NA,"was concluded, and that we had our men",17
NA,"back on the 31st December, 1918.",17
NA,think that I am underestimating the,17
NA,period when I speak of having all the,17
NA,men back at that time. While the,17
NA,men are away we must,17
NA,"the cost, and fo r that",17
NA,we will require to borrow some-,17
NA,"thing like Â£150,000,000 more. Let me",17
NA,put the position i n brief. For the year,17
NA,"1916-17, we will need to raise Â£1,626,000",17
NA,more than what is provided now by taxa-,17
NA,"tion. I n 1917-18, we will require to",17
NA,"raise Â£9,229,000 more than what is pro-",17
NA,"vided to-day by taxation, and the amount",17
NA,required for the half-year ending the,17
NA,"31st December, 1918, w i l l be Â£6,444,000.",17
NA,So that i n order to cover the items which,17
NA,"I have referred to-interes t on loans,",17
NA,"sinking f u n d , repatriation, and war pen-",17
NA,sions-w e will have to raise an additional,17
NA,"sum of Â£17,299,000. The foregoing",17
NA,calculation is based on the assumption,17
NA,that the expenditure on our Expedition-,17
NA,ary Forces will continue for the whole,17
NA,period to meet active service conditions.,17
NA,I t is beyond doubt that our expenditure,17
NA,i n that direction w i l l not be reduced by,17
NA,one penny. I n the estimate no allowance,17
NA,has been made for deferred pay i n re-,17
NA,gard to which our liabilities on the 31st,17
NA,"December, 1918, will be Â£17,049,000. I f",17
NA,"we had to raise a loan to cover that, the",17
NA,interest and sinking f u n d would mean a,17
NA,"yearly expenditure of Â£980,000. Adding",17
NA,"that to the Â£17,299,000 I have mentioned,",17
NA,the amount that will have to be made,17
NA,up by increased taxation comes to,17
NA,"Â£18,279,000. The present War Loan i n -",17
NA,"debtedness, including a final instalment",17
NA,"of Â£2,000,000 from the Imperial Govern-",17
NA,"ment, which had not been paid when I was",17
NA,"in ofiice. is Â£126,893,786. The loan re-",17
NA,cently floated will carry us on u n t i l the,17
NA,end of July next. A t the end of the,17
NA,"financial year 1916-17, we shall have",17
NA,"about Â£4,500,000 of loan money in hand.",17
NA,"Of course, nearly half of the instalments",17
NA,of the present loan will still be unpaid,17
NA,"on the 30th June next, because the pay-",17
NA,ment of the principal is being made i n ten,17
NA,"instalments, of which only five would",17
NA,have been received by that date. On a,17
NA,"monthly war expenditure of Â£4,500,000,",17
NA,our war indebtedness at the end of the,17
NA,year 1917-18 will be,17
NA,"Â£211,302,000, and at the end of 191&",17
NA,"Â£250,000,000, which does not include the",17
NA,"Â£17,000,000 odd liability i n regard to de-",17
NA,"ferred pay. Therefore, Parliament should,",17
NA,"before the prorogation, put the financial",17
NA,"position i n order, because next year w i l l",17
NA,I be more difficult to finance than this year,17
NA,has been. When arranging the dates,17
NA,"for the last War Loan of Â£18,000,000,,",17
NA,I was under the impression that our i n -,17
NA,continue debtedness to the Imperial Government in,17
NA,purpose regard to expenditure by them on our,17
NA,"troops was Â£1,957,680. I obtained those",17
NA,figures from the financial statement' of my,17
NA,"predecessor, who was misled by an under-",17
NA,estimate of the Defence authorities. I,17
NA,"cabled to London to ascertain the facts,",17
NA,and learned that our debt to the Imperial,17
NA,authorities on the 30fch June last was,17
NA,"Â£8,500,000. Had I known this earlier, I",17
NA,"should have tried to borrow Â£25,000,000,",17
NA,but the knowledge influenced me i n ex-,17
NA,tending the time during which applica-,17
NA,tions might be made. I regret that the,17
NA,effort to keep the loan before the public is,17
NA,not so marked now as i t was. A t the end,17
NA,of this financial year we shall have i n,17
NA,hand only one month's Supply for war,17
NA,expenditure. Acting on the advice of ex-,17
NA,"perts, chiefly on the advice of the Com-",17
NA,"monwealth Bank, I decided to fix the",17
NA,date for receiving loan applications as the,17
NA,8th February. M y advisers were under,17
NA,the impression that the wheat and wool,17
NA,money would have been paid by,17
NA,"that date, but the harvest being late, only",17
NA,"one instalment of Â£2,000,000 was paid.",17
NA,"From the wool we expected Â£35,000,000,",17
NA,"and fro m the wheat Â£32,000,000, but",17
NA,there was no payment of any importance,17
NA,on either account before the date fixed,17
NA,for the closing of the loan. I therefore,17
NA,extended the term during which applica-,17
NA,tions could be made.,17
Dr MALONEY ,Th e Victorian Savings,17
NA,Bank helped a good deal with the loan.,17
NA,NA,17
NA,"only to that bank, but also to every bank",17
NA,"in Australia except two, which are only",17
NA,in a small way. The banks used all their,17
NA,machinery to make the loan a success. I,17
NA,"wish to point out, however, that every loan",17
NA,raised on the present terms decreases the,18
NA,Commonwealth's field of taxation. The,18
NA,wealth of Australia is estimated at,18
NA,"Â£1,000,000,000, but, as the Â£80,000,000",18
NA,invested i n the war loan is exempt from,18
NA,"taxation of any kind, tbe taxable area has",18
NA,been reduced by about one-twelfth. I f,18
NA,our permanent war indebtedness is i n -,18
NA,"creased to Â£250,000,000, and all future",18
NA,"loans are raised i n Australia, the taxable",18
NA,"area will be reduced by one-fifth, i f we",18
NA,deduct the amount already raised i n Lon-,18
NA,"don, which will make i t necessary to",18
NA,increase the taxation on the remaining,18
NA,"sources of wealth. Then, again, we",18
NA,have provided that inscribed war stock,18
NA,and war bonds shall be accepted for,18
NA,payment of probate and succession duties,18
NA,"at face value, although there has been",18
NA,a bonus of Â£ 1 10s. 6d - given on every,18
NA,"Â£100 advanced to the 'Government, making",18
NA,the par value of stock and bonds,18
NA,only Â£ 9 8 9s. 6d. The Treasurer estimates,18
NA,"thafc he will receive this year Â£650,000",18
NA,from probate and succession duties. I t is,18
NA,always difficult to estimate the receipts,18
NA,"from this source, but I doubt whether the",18
NA,"amount estimated w i l l be obtained, be-",18
NA,cause the practice' is for nearly every one,18
NA,who has property to provide for the pay-,18
NA,ment of succession and probate dunes with,18
NA,"war stock or bonds. When Treasurer, I",18
NA,instituted a system of war-time savings,18
NA,"certificates, which has been a great success",18
NA,in England. These certificates have a,18
NA,"value of Â£ 1 , Â£ 5 , Â£ 1 0 , and upwards.",18
NA,"also provided for war pence cards, for",18
NA,"which special 6d. stamps could be bought,",18
NA,"and, when-.thirty-six had been attached to",18
NA,"the pence cards, the owner could take up",18
NA,a war-time savings certificate. I arranged,18
NA,also that the certificate should carry,18
NA,"5 per cent, compound interest, which",18
NA,"would nob, however, be exempt from taxa-",18
NA,tion. Under this system a Â£ 1 certificate,18
NA,"would cost the investor 17s. 4d., the dif-",18
NA,ference being accounted f o r by the deduc-,18
NA,"tion of compound interest at 5 per cent,",18
NA,for three years.,18
NA,The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN,18
NA,( Mr THOMSON) -Th e honorable mem-,18
NA,ber's time has expired. Is i t the pleasure,18
NA,of the Committee that the honorable,18
NA,member's time should be extended ?,18
NA,"HONORABLE MEMBERS -Hear , hear!",18
NA,NA,18
NA,saving certificates are of great advantage,18
NA,to men of small means. Persons,18
NA,sessing but a small amouut of capital are,18
NA,"disinclined io invest ib for a long term,",18
NA,because they do not know the moment at,18
NA,which they may require i t . The English,18
NA,war-time saving certificates are issued for,18
NA,"five years, but, under certain conditions,",18
NA,"in the event, f or instance, of sickness or",18
NA,"other grave emergency, the money may be",18
NA,refunded at a lower rate of interest-,18
NA,practically savings bank interest-befor e,18
NA,the due date. Dp Ito October last i n,18
NA,"England alone no less than Â£45,000,000",18
NA,had been raised by this method. This,18
NA,was the latest figure I had when I made,18
NA,"a statement for the press, but i t was esti-",18
NA,mated tbat at that time the amount sub-,18
NA,scribed under this system had been i n -,18
NA,"creased by Â£17,000,000. I n connexion",18
NA,"with the wonderful "" Victory Loan "" the",18
NA,announcement was made in London the,18
NA,"other day that nearly Â£20,000,000 of that",18
NA,loan was subscribed through the agency,18
NA,of these war-time saving certificates.,18
NA,Under the proposal I made the investment,18
NA,"would, as a matter of fact, start at 6d.,",18
NA,"but I proposed certificates of Â£ 1 , Â£ 5 ,",18
NA,"Â£100, and Â£1,000. There is no need to",18
NA,"l i m i t the amount, because those possess-",18
NA,ing a large amount of capital can derive,18
NA,a greater profit by investment in the,18
NA,ordinary way in the war loans at 4^ per,18
NA,"cent., free from taxation, than fchey could",18
NA,derive from war-time saving certificates.,18
NA,"To the man of small means, however, the",18
NA,system affords the advantage of the addi-,18
NA,I tional \ per cent. For a Â£ 5 certificate,18
NA,an investor would have to pay i n Â£ 4 6s.,18
NA,"3d., and at the end of three years he",18
NA,would get Â£ 5 . For the Â£ 1 0 certificate,18
NA,he would have fco pay Â£ 8 12s. 6d. It,18
NA,should be remembered thafc the investor,18
NA,deducts his interest before he pays i n .,18
NA,For fche Â£ 5 0 certificate he would have to,18
NA,pay in Â£ 4 3 3s. 9d. and for the Â£100-,18
NA,certificate he would pay i n Â£ 8 6 7s. 6d.,18
NA,The great advantage to fche small investor,18
NA,is that his capital is locked up for a,18
NA,limited period. I had made arrange-,18
NA,ments i n connexion with the system 1,18
NA,proposed that i n case of sickness or any,18
NA,grave emergency the investor i n a war-,18
NA,time saving certificate should get a refund,18
NA,"of his money and savings bank interest,",18
NA,but i f he did not draw the money for the,18
NA,three years he would get the f u l l 5 per,18
NA,"cent, interest. I t is because people of",18
NA,small means are disinclined to lend money,18
NA,for long terms that our Savings Banks,18
NA,are such a wonderful success. The adop-,18
NA,postion of the war-time saving certificate,18
NA,would be a very great advantage to the,19
NA,"Government, because i t would involve, in",19
NA,"connexion with a loan, only two trans-",19
NA,"actions, the first in receiving the money,",19
NA,and the second in paying ib out. Under,19
NA,"the system of bonds and inscribed stock,",19
NA,"wibh the payment of interest half-yearly,",19
NA,a tremendous staff of clerks is necessary,19
NA,to cope with the work involved. By the,19
NA,deduction of the inberesb in the firsb place,19
NA,all that work might be avoided. To show,19
NA,that there is plenty of money still avail-,19
NA,"able, i t may be pointed out thab the four",19
NA,loans floated in Australia have given us,19
NA,"something like Â£80,000,000, and yet to-",19
NA,day bhere is far more money in the,19
NA,Savings Banks of the Commonwealth,19
NA,bhan bhere was when bhe first of the war,19
NA,"loans was issued. As a matter of fact,",19
NA,"fche amounb was increased bv Â£4,000,000",19
NA,since June lasb.. The latest figures I,19
NA,have are that in the State Savings Banks,19
NA,of the Commonwealth bhe deposits,19
NA,"amount to Â£88,914,316, whilst the",19
NA,deposits in the Commonwealth Savings,19
NA,"Bank amount to Â£10,797,566, making a",19
NA,"total of Â£99,711,S82. There is a corre-",19
NA,sponding increase in the deposits in the,19
NA,Associated Banks.,19
NA,"I hope that, before Parliament rises,",19
NA,the Treasurer will introduce taxation,19
NA,to make both ends meet. I hope,19
NA,"that he will give effect, to the ""War",19
NA,Loan proposition to which I have re-,19
NA,ferred. Under our existing legislation,19
NA,we make provision for interest at no more,19
NA,"than 4i per cent., and it will require to",19
NA,"""be amended to permit of the payment of",19
NA,"interest at 5 per cent, on war-time saving",19
NA,-certificates. I am quite satisfied that if,19
NA,the system is properly instituted it will,19
NA,be successful. It is important to remem-,19
NA,ber that under such a system there would,19
NA,be a continuous stream of money coming,19
NA,"in, as there is under the system in force in",19
NA,the United Kingdom to-day. It would,19
NA,"encourage people to save, and, at the same",19
NA,"time, assist in providing the money neces-",19
NA,sary to win the war. I have mentioned,19
NA,"our commitments, and honorable mem-",19
NA,"bers will agree that the help is required,",19
NA,"not of a few individuals, but of every one",19
NA,"in Australia, to provide the funds which",19
NA,are as essential to the winning of the war,19
NA,"as are the men who are engaged"" in it.",19
NA,I trust that the Treasurer will give a,19
NA,stimulus to the latest War Loan. Under,19
NA,the legislation which has been passed by,19
NA,"this Parliament, we have the power to in-",19
NA,NA,19
NA,"crease the amount of Â£18,000,000, last",19
NA,"called for, up to Â£29,000,000. To-day",19
NA,"we have had contributed over Â£20,000,000,",19
NA,and I am satisfied that we could easily,19
NA,secure the balance i f a little effort is made,19
NA,to do so. I repeat that at the end of the,19
NA,present financial year we shall have pro-,19
NA,vision for only one month's Supply for,19
NA,"war purposes, and we must make an effort",19
NA,to get all the money that it is possible to,19
NA,obtain while it is available.,19
Mr HIGGS ,I call attention to the,19
NA,state of the Committee. [ Quorum formed.'],19
NA,NA,19
NA,sorry that the Postmaster-General is not,19
NA,"present, because I would not have risen",19
NA,to take part in the debate but for some,19
NA,remarks which the honorable gentleman,19
NA,made last evening. As he does not choose,19
NA,"to come into the chamber, I must go on",19
NA,with my speech in his absence. The ob-,19
NA,servations he made last night would lead,19
NA,one to believe that he represented the,19
NA,"whole of the Labour movement, and was",19
NA,the only pure merino. I felt somewhat,19
NA,sore about what the honorable gentleman,19
NA,had to say with regard to the Australian,19
NA,"Workers Union, and what he called the",19
NA,""" junta."" I f there is one man in this",19
NA,"chamber who, more than another, should",19
NA,be grateful to the Australian Workers,19
NA,"Union, he is William Webster, the Post-",19
NA,master-General of the Commonwealth.,19
NA,The Australian Workers Union have,19
NA,done something for the honorable gentle-,19
NA,man that he could not have done for,19
NA,himself. They not only gave him place,19
NA,"and power in the Commonwealth, but",19
NA,financially assisted him to secure his posi-,19
NA,tion.,19
Mr MAHONY ,I think we should have,19
NA,a quorum. [Quorum formed.],19
NA,NA,19
NA,able member for Gwydir fumed and',19
NA,"fretted, and walked up and down like a",19
NA,"caged tiger, when speaking of what the",19
NA,"junta had done for him, and what he had",19
NA,done for the junta. I venture to say that,19
NA,if the relations between the junta and the,19
NA,honorable member were considered from,19
NA,"the pounds, shillings, and pence point of",19
NA,"view, i t would be found that the honor-",19
NA,able gentleman is a debtor to the Labour,19
NA,movement to a very great extent. He,19
NA,tried at one time to get into the New,19
NA,South Wales Parliament for the electoral,19
NA,division of Canterbury. The honorable,19
NA,"gentleman stood at the time, not in the",19
NA,"Labour interest, but in the Protectionist",20
NA,"interest, and he was pelted from one end",20
NA,of the electorate to the other with bags of,20
NA,flour. Therefore he has indeed a lot to,20
NA,talk about. These gentlemen make,20
NA,me smile when they talk of what,20
NA,they have done for the Labour move-,20
NA,ment. I wish to be candid. The,20
NA,honorable member for'' Moreton seems,20
NA,terribly concerned about '.' poor old Dad,20
NA,"Spence,"" the honorable member for Dar-",20
NA,ling. As far as that honorable member,20
NA,"is concerned, his drop from grace has",20
NA,"been a tragedy in connexion, with this",20
NA,political crisis. He has been the father,20
NA,of the Labour movement in Australia; his,20
NA,name until a few months ago was one,20
NA,to conjure with; he had the love of.,20
NA,every man of the .pastoral branch of the,20
NA,Australian Workers Union from one end,20
NA,"of Australia to the other, and I say, in",20
NA,"all sincerity, his drop from grace has",20
NA,been a tragedy.,20
Mr LYNCH , He is more honoured,20
NA,than ever.,20
NA,NA,20
NA,prove it. Until the time that he slipped,20
NA,he had a majority of votes from all parts,20

NA,"Commonwealth is passing through to-day,",22
NA,and the principal actors i n the events of,22
NA,that time were .William Morris Hughes,22

NA,"get on, although he has not signed a",23
NA,"pledge. One particular member, whom",23
NA,"I shall not name, went against his party,",23
NA,and has remembered i t ever since. The,23
NA,"late Tommy Bent was in i t , and so were",23
NA,"the Minister for Works and Railways,",23
NA,and several other members of this House.,23
NA,The honorable member to whom I,23
NA,refer took i t on himself to play a lone,23
NA,"hand, and they not only sacrificed him,",23
NA,but scarified him from one end of Vic-,23
NA,toria to the other. Honorable members,23
NA,"opposite, therefore, must not blame the",23
NA,Labour party as i f they were the only,23
NA,ones to do that sort of thing. We have,23
NA,too often been deluded by promises by,23
NA,men who forgot them as soon as they got,23
NA,into Parliament. For the time being,23
NA,this vituperation seems bad. but we have,23
NA,"been through i t all before, and the Labour",23
NA,party will survive i t all. A cork will,23
NA,stay under water only as long as a man,23

NA,people to the character of their represen-,23
NA,tation in Parliament when they repose,23
NA,their trust i n the Labour candidates at,23
NA,a general election. We have had during,23
NA,this debate some entertaining and instruc-,23
NA,tive light lefc i n on the methods and,23
NA,practices of Caucus government.,23
NA,"revelations are very useful, because when",23
NA,"we, as members of the Liberal party,",23
NA,attempted to open the eyes of the eleotors,23
NA,fco the farce enacted under the name of,23
NA,"Democracy, by which the Labour party,",23
NA,professing adherence to the principles o f,23
NA,"eoual freedom and equal justice, and the",23
NA,representation of the majority of the peo-,23
NA,"ple, in practice showed that they did",23
NA,"nothing for, and cared less about, such",23
NA,"principles, the united voice of the Labour",23
NA,a members declared thafc we were stating,23
NA,something which was not correct. We-,23
NA,pointed out thafc their only guiding prin-,23
NA,ciple was slavish obedience to an irrespon-,23
NA,something sible self-constituted authority which,23
NA,"has been termed a junta, and which",23
NA,"claimed, and exercised, the righ t to hold",23
NA,a sword over the head of every Labour-,23
NA,member i f he did not do its bid-,23
NA,"ding, and to destroy his political career",23
NA,for ever by withholding f r o m h i m any,23
NA,chance of getting another Labour selec-,23
NA,tion. The public will now have the satis-,23
NA,faction of knowing that our statements on,23
NA,those occasions have been more than amply,23
NA,"corroborated by members who, until re-",23
NA,"cently, belonged to that party, but have-",23
NA,severed their connexion with ib through,23
NA,circumstances of overbearing tyrannical,23
NA,despotism which need not be again re-,23
NA,ferred to. We have now some inside,23
NA,knowledge of the peculiar ethics which,23
NA,"govern the constitution of that party, and'",23
NA,the Caucus revelations i n this debate,23
NA,show clearly that there can be no such,23
NA,thing as responsible government under,23
NA,Labour rule i n this country.,23
Mr FENTON ,Yo u have responsible go-,23

Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON ,W e hope-,23
NA,to re-establish responsible government.,23
NA,Those honorable members who recently,23
NA,"belonged to the Caucus party, and have",23
NA,"since severed their connexion with i t , must",23
NA,feel already the beneficial effects of the,23
NA,freer political atmosphere they are now,23
NA,breathing.,23
Mr FENTON ,Tha t accounts for their-,23
NA,ferocity.,23
Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON ,Th e,23
NA,ferocity seems to have been all on the,23
NA,other side. One of the most excruciatingly,23
NA,funny features of the whole situation is-,23
NA,fche vituperation and vindictiveness dis-,23
NA,played towards their late leader by the,23
NA,members of what is now known .as the,23
NA,Official Labour party. We have only to,23
NA,These carry our minds back to a few short weeks -,23
NA,"ago, when the present Prime Minister re-",23
NA,"turned from England, with exactly the",23
NA,same views that he has since been express-,23
NA,ing. There was then i n the minds o f,23
NA,every member of the Caucus party the-,23
NA,feeling that the speeches delivered i n Lon-,24
NA,don-whic h they applauded and which,24
NA,they described as being the speeches of,24
NA,one of the greabesb statesmen of uhe Em-,24
NA,pire-speeche s by a man of whom they,24
NA,said they had every reason to be intensely,24
NA,proud-portende d a certain course of action,24
NA,in the raising of the necessary reinforce-,24
NA,ments for the f r o n t ; and they f u,24
NA,"cipated, and were prepared for the Prime",24
NA,"Minister, as their leader, declaring",24
NA,straight out for conscription as soon as he,24
NA,returned. Had he taken the course which,24
NA,a strong man would have taken under,24
NA,"the circumstances, undeterred by fear of",24
NA,what might happen to his party as a,24
NA,"result of his action, I have reason to know",24
NA,that many of those who are amongst the,24
NA,most extreme in their denunciation of him,24
NA,would still have been amongst his heartiest,24
NA,supporters. I t was only because he shirked,24
NA,"a responsibility which he, as the Prime",24
NA,Minister of the countrv. ought to have,24
NA,shouldered-an d I have never said any-,24
NA,thing to the contrary-h e being the one,24
NA,man alone i n Australia who was i n posses-,24
NA,"sion of all the facts, and shifted i t on to",24
NA,"the people, that the present position of",24
NA,vitriolic personal animosity has arisen.,24
NA,H e took what I consider was the,24
NA,most injudicious step of calling up the,24
NA,"manhood of the country, without any",24
NA,discrimination-withou t any regard to the,24
NA,"various interests, either of the men them-",24
NA,"selves or of employers and others-and ,",24
NA,"further, he delayed the taking of the",24
NA,referendum for so long a time as to give,24
NA,every opportunity for hostile organiza-,24
NA,"tion, and for the work of misrepresenta-",24
NA,"tion, mendacity, destruction, and defeat",24
NA,t o be arranged and efficiently carried,24
NA,out. I t was only when this work,24
NA,was i n progress that a number of,24
NA,"those members, who otherwise would",24
NA,have been found behind the Prime Minis-,24
NA,"ter, decided, as a result of the pressure",24
NA,brought on them by the secret junta,24
NA,"outside, and the fear of its disappro-",24
NA,bation affecting the retention of their,24
NA,"seats, to take a course i n antagonism to",24
NA,him. We have to go back but a few,24
NA,"weeks ago when the very men, who to-",24
NA,day cannot find words i n the English lan-,24
NA,guage strong enough to express their deep,24
NA,"detestation, abhorrence, and hatred of the",24
NA,"Prime Minister, were rushing to be the",24
NA,"first to buy tickets, at a guinea each, for",24
NA,a banquet given i n his honour.,24
NA,the Prime Minister is the same man with,24
NA,exactly the same sentiments to-day as,24
NA,he expressed then; i n that respect he has,24
NA,certainly not changed one iota. So there,24
NA,is something for those honorable gentle-,24
NA,men to explain. They have yet to explain,24
NA,the real reason for their peculiar .change,24
NA,"of attitude towards their late leader, who",24
NA,was. but a few short weeks ago their idol,24
NA,"and hero, and whom they now hound",24
NA,l l y antidown from one end of the country,24
NA,"to the other, i n the vilest possible terms.",24
NA,The honorable member for Brisbane,24
NA,made some remarks about the atti-,24
NA,tude of the Liberal party towards the,24
NA,Prime Minister i n this time of the Em-,24
NA,pire's peril. I remind that honorable,24
NA,"inember, and those who applauded",24
NA,"him while he was speaking, that his state-",24
NA,ment thab the Liberals were tardy in,24
NA,-taking advantage of an opportunitv,24
NA,offered them to take possession of the,24
NA,"Treasury benches, is a flat contradiction",24
NA,of statements made by other members on,24
NA,the public platform to the effect that,24
NA,Liberals were trying by every possible,24
NA,"means, and with indecent haste., to put",24
NA,their noses into the Treasury bag. One,24
NA,statement is a flat contradiction of the,24
NA,other; and i t would seem thafc whatever,24
NA,"course the Liberals had taken would,",24
NA,"i n the eyes of the Labour members,",24
NA,be wrong. I f they had accepted the offer,24
NA,of the Labour party to occupyfcheTreasury,24
NA,"benches, with the assured support of the",24
NA,"Official Labour party, they would have",24
NA,laid themselves open to the accusation-,24
NA,and the just accusation-o f having taken,24
NA,a mean advantage of the position of,24
NA,affairs to destroy the man who at,24
NA,that time was doing his very best i n the,24
NA,interests of the Empire. Even i f such an,24
NA,offer had been made-whic h i t had not-,24
NA,the Liberal party was not prepared,24
NA,to take that contemptible course. What,24
NA,they did was to assure the Prime,24
NA,Minister of the same generous measure,24
NA,of support i n the conduct of the,24
NA,"war, and all matters arising out of i t ,",24
NA,"that they had given to his. predecessors,",24
NA,who are now denouncing the Prime M i n -,24
NA,ister. I t was only when the position be-,24
NA,"came accentuated, and the intolerable-",24
NA,ness of the position became evident,24
NA,through the request of the Imperial Go-,24
NA,"vernment for Australia, i n the person of",24
NA,"its Prime Minister, i f possible, to be re-",24
NA,presented at one of the most important,24
NA,Imperial Conferences that has ever been,24
NA,"Yet held in the history of the world, that the",24
NA,Liberals saw how imprssible i t would be,24
NA,to maintain the prevailing,25
NA,"Under these circumstances, and primarily",25
NA,to prevent undue delay in Australia be-,25
NA,"ing properly, effectively, and",25
NA,tively represented at the Imperial,25
NA,"ference, the Liberals suggested that, if",25
NA,"possible, there should be some",25
NA,made to have a united Parliament,25
NA,enable the Prime Minister,25
NA,ceed at once to London.,25
NA,"object in view, suggestions were",25
NA,for a union of parties.,25
NA,was to have a united War,25
NA,"ment, and to set aside party aims and",25
NA,"party platforms for the time being, in",25
NA,order that the whole attention and energv,25
NA,of Parliament might' be directed to the,25
NA,"successful prosecution of the war, to the",25
NA,exclusion of all extraneous matters of a do-,25
NA,mestic nature that might very well await a,25
NA,more convenient time and opportunity.,25
NA,that end there were certain,25
NA,"as honorable members know, between the",25
NA,Prinie Minister and the then Leader of,25
NA,"the Opposition, the honorable member for",25
NA,Parramatta. When a proposal was made,25
NA,for a union of these two parties with this,25
NA,"object, a suggestion was made by the Libe-",25
NA,ral Leader to the Prime Minister to se-,25
NA,cure unity of the whole Parliament,25
NA,inviting the leader of each of the three,25
NA,"parties to a conference, with a view to",25
NA,"some basis of agreement, which would en-",25
NA,able Parliament to deal effectively,25
NA,"the war problems. As a result of this, as",25
NA,already admitted by honorable,25
NA,"on the other side, and also by the Leader",25
NA,"of the Opposition, a request was sent by",25
NA,"the Prime Minister, at the instigation of",25
NA,"the Liberal leader, to Mr Tudor, as",25
NA,"Leader of the Labour party, to join in",25
NA,a conference of the kind. That,25
NA,"was "" turned down "" by the Labour",25
NA,and an intimation to that effect was sent,25
NA,to the Prime Minister by its,25
NA,the honorable member for,25
NA,Then the position-and,25
NA,as well to emphasize the,25
NA,such that no other course was open,25
NA,but for the two remaining,25
NA,"forming a majority-of this House, at",25
NA,any rate-to bring about some union by,25
NA,which the same objective might be at-,25
NA,tained. To that end tbe present arrange-,25
NA,"ment was made, under which the Prime",25
NA,Minister is being supported by the Libe-,25
NA,"ral party, with a view to bringing",25
NA,"first, representation, at the earliest pos-",25
NA,"sible moment, of Australia",25
NA,Mr W. Elliot Johnson.,25
NA,"situation. Imperial Conference, and, i n the second",25
NA,"place, the establishment of responsible",25
NA,government. The first of these objects,25
NA,authorita- has been again frustrated by unpatriotic,25
NA,Con- action i n the Senate. I t ill-befits honor-,25
NA,able members on the other side to attempt,25
NA,attempt to throw a gibe at the Liberals f o r their,25
NA,to attitude. The Liberal party has shown,25
NA,to pro- all through-eve r since the last elec-,25
NA,With that tion-thaf c they are prepared to tem-,25
NA,"made porarily lay aside and, as a mat-",25
NA,"The idea ter of fact, have subordinated their",25
NA,"Govern- party and platform, their party aims",25
NA,"and provincial questions, to the supreme",25
NA,duty of assisting the Empire to meet the,25
NA,present peril. B u t they have been,25
NA,consistently thwarted by what is known as,25
NA,"the Official Labour party, ever since the",25
NA,split between the sections of that partv,25
NA,took place. On the shoulders of that paity,25
NA,To alone rests the responsibility for the Prime,25
NA,"negotiations, Minister not being i n London at the. pre-",25
NA,sent time-fo r Australia not being repre-,25
NA,sented at an Imperial Conference which is,25
NA,"actually now sitting. They, also, are alone",25

NA,House not being able to go throughout,25
NA,"Australia, i n their own and other .con-",25
NA,"stituencies, to assist recruiting with a",25
NA,view to adequately reinforce the men,25
NA,by who are now shedding their blood i n,25
NA,doing the Empire's service i n the trenches,25
NA,ab the front. I n consequence of the,25

NA,the Official Labour party are able,25
NA,"sections to l i m i t Supply to very short periods,",25
NA,which necessitates the House sitting,25
NA,for the greater part of each month.,25
NA,B y this means they are able to prevent,25
NA,honorable members from attending re-,25
NA,cruiting meetings to help reinforcements,25
NA,"being sent to the front, and are also pre-",25
NA,"about, venting Australia being represented at the",25
NA,Imperial War Conference. I n such cir-,25
NA,at the,25
NA,cumstances I would like to know how they,26
NA,can claim credit for being imbued with,26
NA,any real patriotism at all. Their every,26
NA,"act, despite their lip professions, proves",26
NA,that they are absolutely destitute of,26
NA,patriotism. A l l their actions are,26
NA,"with certain organizations outside, and are",26
NA,designed at once to prevent Australia,26
NA,being represented at the forthcoming Im-,26

Dr MALONEY ,There is not a quorum,26
NA,present. [Quorum formed.],26
NA,Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON -M y,26
NA,remarks are prompted by certain speeches,26
NA,which have been delivered in this cham-,26
NA,"ber, and which were delivered for only",26
NA,one purpose. I do not think i t is right,26
NA,that those speeches should be broad-,26
NA,cast throughout the country per medium,26
NA,of Hansard without something _ being,26
NA,said to counter-balance the misrepre-,26
NA,sentations which they contain. I n the,26
NA,"first place, I enter my protest against",26
NA,honorable members opposite attempting,26
NA,to fasten'on the Liberal party any ulterior,26
NA,object in connexion either with conscrip-,26
NA,"tion, the imposition of duties on tea and",26
NA,"kerosene, a reduction in old-age pensions,",26
NA,or the employment of black labour. I t,26
NA,has been hinted that these are the things,26
NA,upon which our opponents propose to fight,26
NA,the ensuing election. We now know the,26
NA,main items of their programme of misre-,26
NA,"presentation, and I take this opportunity",26
NA,of saying that they know f u l l well that,26
NA,there is not one atom of truth in any of,26
NA,these allegations. The party with which I,26
NA,am associated has no intention whatever,26
NA,"of putting taxes on tea and kerosene, re-",26
NA,"ducing pensions, interfering with the",26
NA,"""White Australia"" policy, or forcing",26
NA,conscription on the people of this country.,26
NA,There is not a single member of the party,26
NA,who would consent to such a course of ac-,26
NA,tion on the part either of the Prime Min-,26
NA,ister or of any other responsible member,26
NA,of the Government.,26
Mr BURNS ,Di d the honorable mem-,26
NA,"ber say "" no "" member?",26
NA,Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON -Yes .,26
NA,No responsible member of the Govern-,26
NA,ment.,26
Mr BURNS ,Wha t about the honor-,26
NA,able member for Henty ?,26
NA,Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON -H e,26
NA,"is a private member, and must respect",26
NA,the verdict of the people until that verdict,26
NA,has been reversed.,26
Mr BURNS ,H e said that he would,26
NA,assist to bring in conscription in defiance,26
NA,of the will of the people. Sir William,26
NA,in line Irvine said the same thing.,26
NA,Mr W. ELLIOT JOELNSON -Si r,26
NA,William Irvine has frequently denied,26
NA,having said anything of the kind. Had,26
NA,there been any intention to do what has,26
NA,"been suggested, the surest way of prevent-",26
NA,ing i t would be for the Labour party to,26
NA,assist in the formation of a TJnited,26
NA,War Government. They declined to,26
NA,do so. They know perfectly well that,26
NA,nothing of the kind is intended. I t is,26
NA,idle for them to accept the oral statement,26
NA,"of one member of our party, who stated",26
NA,"that he spoke for himself only, as binding",26
NA,upon the whole of the members of that,26
NA,"party, or upon any section of i t . But",26
NA,whilst honorable members opposite know,26
NA,"this perfectly well, .they will not hesi-",26
NA,tate to scatter broadcast such misrepre-,26
NA,sentations from the public platform.,26
NA,"I n their speeches here, we have had an",26
NA,indication of the lying campaign which is,26
NA,to be indulged in. Absolute falsehoods,26
NA,are the foundations upon which they are,26
NA,"going to conduct it. I t is just as well,",26
NA,"therefore, that before i Parliament ad-",26
NA,journs we should endeavour to scotch this,26
NA,"sort of thing, and warn the unwary of",26
NA,the submarining methods our opponents,26
NA,employ. Only yesterday the honor-,26
NA,able member for Bourke expressed the,26
NA,hope that the approaching campaign will,26
NA,"bo conducted fairly, decently, and honor-",26
NA,"ably. I echo his wish, and I trust that",26
NA,he will use his influence with his party,26
NA,to secure that end. So far as the Liberal,26
NA,"party is concerned, its members have al-",26
NA,ways fought political issues free from,26
NA,"personalities, free from misrepresentation,",26

Mr FENTON , Honorable members,26
NA,"may pride themselves on it, but they do",26

NA,"in the coming struggle, we shall have the",26
NA,satisfaction of knowing that our fights,26
NA,have been free f r o m the blemishes I have,27
NA,mentioned. I t is most regrettable that,27
NA,the approaching election has been forced,27
NA,upon the people at a time when the Prime,27
NA,Minister of the Commonwealth should be,27
NA,discussing with the Prime Minister of,27
NA,"Great Britain , and the Prime Ministers",27
NA,"of the overseas Dominions, matters vitally-",27
NA,"affecting the present and future of, Aus-",27
NA,"tralia i n relation to the Pacific, and other",27
NA,questions of the greatest importance to,27
NA,"our future development, as well as to that",27
NA,"of the Empire. I deplore that we, as the",27
NA,"result of the actions of the Labour party,",27
NA,are compelled to be present i n Parlia-,27
NA,ment when we ought to be amongst our,27
NA,constituents endeavouring to stimulate re-,27

Mr BURNS , I l l a w a r r a ) [5.27] - A,27
NA,tremendous amount of political capital,27
NA,has been sought to be made out of the,27
NA,necessity which we are assured exists f o r,27
NA,a union of the political forces i n this Par-,27
NA,liament. Need I point out that there,27
NA,were many reasons which prevented such,27
NA,a union f r o m being consummated.,27
NA,this connexion I have only to recall the,27
NA,utterances of the Prime Minister i n re-,27
NA,gard to those who differed' f r o m h i m dur-,27
NA,ing the recent conscription campaign.,27
NA,"For example, he said that those on the",27
NA,anti-conscription side were i n receipt of,27
NA,"German gold, that the influence of the",27
NA,"Kaiser was at work amongst them, and",27
NA,that they were connected w i t h the Indus-,27
NA,"t r i a l ""Workers of the World. I f these",27
NA,"statements were correct then, they must",27
NA,be correct now. For the right honorable,27
NA,gentleman to make such statements about,27
NA,"members of this Parliament, and imme-",27
NA,diately afterwards to invite them to j o i n,27
NA,with h i m i n the establishment of a N a -,27
NA,"tional Government, was obviously to seek",27
NA,the impossible.,27
NA,NA,27
NA,things of honorable members opposite.,27
Mr BURNS , B u t the Prime Minister,27
NA,"did, and while he holds the views which",27
NA,"he does, I w i l l not support any party",27
NA,which supports him. I t has been said by Works-,27
NA,various speakers that the conscription,27
NA,issue is dead. B u t we have also been aspared,27
NA,sured by others that we must have conthat,27
NA,"scription, and that they were prepared to",27
NA,go to the extreme of bringing i t about,27
NA,under the provisions of the W a r Precau-,27
NA,tions Act.,27
Mr RICHARD FOSTER ,Wh o said that?,27
NA,The honorable member ought to be,27
NA,ashamed of himself.,27
Mr BURNS , A t Dandenong the hon-,27
NA,orable member f o r Flinders made the,27
NA,"statement that, so f a r as he was concerned,",27
NA,conscription would be brought i n . Sena-,27
NA,"tor Lynch, the ex-Minister f o r Works and",27
NA,"Railways, upon his return to Adelaide",27
NA,"f r o m Western Australia, also declared",27
NA,that he was not satisfied w i th the result,27
NA,"of the referendum, and that he would fight",27
NA,for conscription. He said that he had,27
NA,"always been a conscriptionist, that he was",27
NA,"so still, and that, i f the voluntary system",27
NA,"failed, as i t would, then conscription would",27
NA,be brought i n .,27
Mr RICHARD FOSTER ,Th e honorable,27

Mr BURNS , I was referring to a,27

Mr RICHARD FOSTER ,Bu t tlie honor-,27
NA,able member paid that i t had been made,27
NA,by several honorable members on the,27

Mr BURNS , I said that a statement,27
NA,of the kind had been made by one honor-,27
NA,"able member i n the House, while several",27
NA,others had made i t outside. The hon-,27
NA,orable member for Henty said i n this,27

NA,i t was by referendum or otherwise.,27
Mr CORSER ,Tha t is only his indi-,27

Mr BURNS ,Le t me read to honor-,27

NA,the Adelaide Register of 19th January last,27
NA,as to an interview which a representative,27
NA,of that newspaper had at Parliament,27
NA,"House, Adelaide, on the previous day",27
NA,"with Senator Lynch, then Minister for",27
NA,What the Tudor party will do I am not pre-,27
NA,"to state, but I have a belief that, unless",27
NA,"party radically alters its mind, its sup-",27
NA,port could not be depended upon. The Hughes,27
NA,faction stands in its present position because,27
NA,of a difference on that vital issue.,27
NA,The Hughes party is not going to alter,28
NA,modify its course; so that if the voluntary,28
NA,"tem is to be supplanted by compulsion, it can .that?",28
NA,only be done by Mr Tudor and his followers,28
NA,"unsaying what they have said, realizing the",28
NA,"truly desperate nature of the position, and",28
NA,making common cause with those who put,28
NA,nation in front of all parliamentary party,28
NA,considerations.,28
NA,Whatever change is wrought will have,28
NA,on their side. The two divisions of the,28
NA,party cannot form a National Administration,28
NA,until then.,28
NA,The whole of the men who belong to the,28
NA,so-called National Government of New,28
NA,South Wales took the platform i n the,28
NA,"recent referendum campaign, and were",28
NA,pledged to support conscription. I t was,28
NA,not a written pledge,28
Mr ARCHIBALD , W h a t have we to do,28
NA,with them?,28
Mr BURNS ,The y are supporters,28
NA,"the honorable member's party; indeed,",28
NA,belong to the one party.,28
NA,of the so-called National Government,28

NA,ing a document pledging themselves,28
NA,respect the decision of the referendum,28
NA,"28th October, and to oppose any attempt",28
NA,to revive conscription. The majority,28
NA,' those who are signing this pledge are,28
NA,"members of the Liberal party, who have",28
NA,denounced written pledges over and over,28
NA,"again, asserting that the only pledge",28
NA,are prepared to give is that of their,28
NA,spoken word. Why are they signing this,28
NA,pledge ? They are running away from the,28
NA,issue. We were told that if thÂ© referendum,28
NA,were defeated they would t r y and t r y he went.,28
NA,"again. Mr Holman, when speaking",28
NA,"Mascot, was asked, "" I f the referendum",28

NA,to take a certain course. H e did not take,28
NA,"the public into his confidence, however, as",28
NA,to what that course of action would be.,28
NA,He made a similar statement at Mel-,28

NA,all hours before the Caucus meeting of about,28
NA,"The members 23rd August last, even his own colleagues-",28

NA,coming sure has bhe Senate thrown out?,28
Mr SINCLAIR , I t threw out a Supply,28
Mr BURNS , I t did not. I t merely,28

NA,cirto provide for only one month's Supply.,28
Mr SINCLAIR ,T o stop recruiting.,28
Mr BURNS ,Nothin g of the kind .,29
NA,A question was asked i n the House to-,29

NA,which was not allowed here. Regula-,29
NA,"tions issued from time to time, by the",29
NA,Prime Minister and the Minister of De-,29
NA,"fence, under the War Precautions A c t ,",29
NA,were responsible for the action of the,29
NA,Senate i n refusing to grant more than a.,29
NA,month's Supply. The Senate desired to,29
NA,keep a watchful eye on the Prime M i n -,29
NA,ister and his doings regarding the cen-,29
NA,sorship. I f the censorship had been re-,29
NA,"laxed, the late Hughes Government",29
NA,would have had no difficulty i n obtaining,29
NA,the three months' Supply for which i t,29
NA,asked. B u t to safeguard the interests of,29
NA,"the people and the press of Australia, the",29
NA,Senate took this action so as to make i t,29
NA,necessary to summon a meeting of Par-,29
NA,liament within the time prescribed for,29
NA,the laying of these regulations on the,29
NA,table. I have i n my possession a mani-,29
NA,festo that was issued to the Australian,29
NA,troops at the f r o n t by the present Prime,29
NA,Minister. This manifesto has been i n the,29
NA,hands of the editors of various news-,29
NA,"papers i n Australia, who intended to",29
NA,publish i t . I t had to be submitted to,29
NA,"the censor, however, and its publication",29
NA,was prohibited. Here is the manifesto.,29
NA,Honorable members w i l l see across i t the,29
NA,"censor's stamp, and his blue pencil mark.",29
NA,This manifesto was good enough to issue,29
NA,to the soldiers at the f r o n,29

NA,MANIFESTO TO AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS.,29
NA,"FROM MB. W. M. HUGHES, PRIMS MINISTER",29
NA,OF THE COMMONWEALTH.,29
NA,Soldiers of Australia},29
NA,"After more than two years of heroic effort,",29
NA,"the tide of battle, which so long ran strongly",29
NA,"with the enemy, who bad been prepared for",29
NA,"and deliberately provoked war, turns slowly",29
NA,but surely in our favour. The results of the,29
NA,"Great Offensive, during which you have added",29
NA,"fresh lustre to the glorious name of Anzac,",29
NA,have shown that if the Allies but press reso-,29
NA,"lutely on, decisive victory must crown their",29
NA,heroic labours.,29
NA,But though the valour and dash of the Allied,29
NA,forces have pushed her legions back along a,29
NA,"wide front, the day of decisive victory is not",29
NA,yet in sight. No one of you who knows the tre-,29
NA,"mendous resources of the enemy, his courage,",29
NA,"his determination, will say that Germany is",29
NA,yet defeated.,29
NA,Yet she must be defeated.,29
NA,"The world yearns for peace, but any peace",29
NA,"would be but a hollow mockery, unless the",29
NA,great disturber of the world's peace were first,29
NA,beaten to her knees. Until Germany is driven,29
NA,"headlong from France and Belgium, and de-",29
NA,"cisively beaten on her own soil, she will never",29
NA,consent to the peace that the Allies want and,29
NA,are determined to have.,29
NA,In order to ensure decisive victory the Allies,29
NA,have decided to put every available man into,29
NA,"the field, so that their Armies may be kept",29
NA,"at full strength, and every man in the trenches",29
NA,kept fit by frequent reliefs.,29
NA,The Path to Victory.,29
NA,"When you know all this, you know also that",29
NA,the path of victory lies stretched in front of,29
NA,you. You know it is on the Western Front,29
NA,that the crashing blow must be delivered. You,29
NA,"know that more men are needed, and the Bri-",29
NA,tish Empire must supply them.,29
NA,France for nearly two years endured the,29
NA,brunt of the most ferocious batterings of the,29
NA,enemy. The bones of her gallant sons strewed,29
NA,the soil of their dear France like shells on,29
NA,the sea shore. She has covered herself with,29
NA,imperishable glory. She was never so great,29
NA,as in this supreme hour of her trial. Despite,29
NA,"their great losses, her glorious soldiers still",29
NA,"fight on with unshaken resolution, and will",29
NA,"fight while one Frenchman, capable of bearing",29
NA,"t and i n Eng- arms, remains alive.",29
NA,Now is the hour when our race must prove,29
NA,itself worthy of its traditions and its heritage.,29
NA,"This is our War, Soldiers t",29
NA,This is Australia's war just as much as,29
NA,France's or Belgium's. Our liberties and our,29
NA,"national existence are equally, nay, more, at",29
NA,stake. Australia must do her share. Britain,29
NA,has told us what she expects us to do; i t is,29
NA,"not"" inore than we can or ought to do, it is",29
NA,"indeed, much less proportionately than she her-",29
NA,self has done.,29
NA,We have sent overseas and have in camp in,29
NA,Australia or in England and in the field less,29
NA,than three hundred thousand troops. Britain,29
NA,has five million under arms. I f we had done,29
NA,as much we should have enlisted five hundred,29
NA,thousand instead of little more than half that,29
NA,number.,29
NA,"Voluntary recruiting has, unfortunately,",29
NA,proved quite inadequate to supply the necessary,29
NA,number of men during the past three months.,29
NA,"Thongh voluntarism fails, Australia must",29
NA,"not fail. Duty, honour, and self-interest alike",29
NA,point the path we must tread.,29
NA,The Spirit of Patriotism: The Duty of,30
NA,"Upon the citizens of Australia, the freest",30
NA,"Democracy the world has ever known, there",30
NA,rests a grave and solemn responsibility. Tbey,30
NA,are called upon to show themselves worthy,30
NA,of their great privileges. The sacred duty of,30
NA,every free man is to fight i n the defence of,30
NA,his country. Men ought not to wait to be,30
NA,"compelled to do their duty, they ought rather",30
NA,to rush to the ranks on the first sound of.,30
NA,the tocsin.,30
NA,"I t was this spirit, soldiers, that inspired",30
NA,you to enlist. I t was this spirit that spurred,30
NA,you to your great deeds on Gallipoli and i n,30
NA,France. I t is this spirit that now upholds,30
NA,"you, and urges you on.",30
NA,Voluntarism has Failed.,30
NA,I had hoped that this spirit so perwasited,30
NA,Australian manhood that we should only need,30
NA,to ask for men to be overwhelmed with recruits;,30
NA,but during these past five months the number,30
NA,of men offering themselves has been steadily,30
NA,"falling oft, and is now a mere fraction of",30
NA,those required for drafts.,30
NA,The Government Proposals.,30
NA,I n these circumstances the Government has,30
NA,decided that the deficiency between the number,30
NA,of men required and the monthly quota must,30
NA,be made up by compulsion. On the twenty-,30
NA,"eighth of this month, the citizens of Australia",30
NA,"will be asked to vote "" Yes "" to the following",30
NA,question :-,30
NA,""" Are you i n favour of the Government",30
NA,"having in this grave emergency, the same",30
NA,compulsory powers over citizens i n regard,30
NA,to requiring their military service for the,30
NA,"term of the war outside the Commonwealth,",30
NA,as i t now has in regard to military service,30
NA,"within the Commonwealth ?""",30
NA,I f the citizens and soldiers of Australia ap-,30
NA,"prove, the Government will thereafter provide",30
NA,that either by voluntary enlistment or by com-,30
NA,pulsion the regular monthly reinforcement shall,30
NA,be trained and sent abroad to maintain the,30
NA,Australian Army.,30
NA,The Government consider that the number,30
NA,of fit single men without dependants is suffi-,30
NA,"cient, when supplemented by voluntary recruit-",30
NA,"ing, to carry us through the war. The Go-",30
NA,vernment believe that i t will not be necessary,30
NA,to call up married men. The following classes,30
NA,of single men will be exempt:-,30
NA,1. A l l under 21 years of age;,30
NA,2. Only sons;,30
NA,3. Single men who are the sole support of,30
NA,dependents;,30
NA,4. When one or more members of a family,30
NA,"have enlisted, the remaining members",30
NA,up to at least one half of the whole,30
NA,"family, will be exempt.",30
NA,There will also be exemptions for the number,30
NA,of men requisite to carry on certain vital in-,30
NA,dustries.,30
NA,Other men who claim exemption for special,30
NA,reasons will have their cases heard by non-,30
NA,"military tribunals, with appeal to a State",30

NA,No State of the Commonwealth which has,30

NA,"direction of Mr Speaker, is censored be-",31
NA,"fore he receives it, and generally it is a",31
NA,week late. When he asked the censor for,31
NA,"a reason, he was told that there might",31
NA,be something of a seditious nature in,31
NA,"Mansard, and so the censor had to look",31
NA,"-over it. I understand, however, that i f",31
NA,anything of a seditious nature were said,31
NA,"in this House, its publication in Mansard",31
NA,"would not be allowed. Yesterday, be-",31
NA,cause an affidavit put in by Dr Maloney,31
NA,"was out of order, it was withdrawn from",31
NA,Mansard. I am not taking any exception,31
NA,to this course at all. I am merely point-,31
NA,ing out that i f anything of a seditious,31
NA,"nature were said in the House, it would",31
NA,"be withheld from publication, and I can-",31
NA,"not see Avhy these men, located all over",31
NA,"Australia, should be devoting so much of",31
NA,their time to censoring documents.,31
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN , -,31
NA,The honorable member's time has expired.,31
Mr CHARLTON ,Hunter) [5.56] -,31
NA,I did not intend to take part in this de-,31
NA,"bate at all, but so many references havo",31
NA,been made to recent happenings that I,31
NA,find it imperative to say a few words.,31
NA,No one will accuse me of showing a spirit,31
NA,of malignity towards any member of this,31
NA,"House, either during the recent cam-",31
NA,paign or within the precincts of Parlia-,31
NA,ment. During this debate a good deal has,31
NA,"been said about what happened in Caucus,",31
NA,and as I happen to be connected with the,31
NA,"executive, and haye never, up to the pre-",31
NA,"sent moment, expressed an opinion out-",31
NA,"side the party meetings, I feel I should",31
NA,say something now with regard to the,31
NA,conflicting statements that have been,31
NA,"made from time to time, especially as the",31
NA,Prime Minister himself stated that there,31
NA,was one member on this side who could,31
NA,throw some light on the matters referred,31
NA,to. I want to sav at once that tbe Prime,31
NA,Minister's statement relative to the party,31
NA,asking him go out to the different execu-,31
NA,tives with a view to getting freedom of,31
NA,action for members now sitting on this,31
NA,"side of the House towards conscription,",31
NA,was incorrect and misleading. A t the,31
NA,Caucus meeting I immediately followed,31
NA,"the Prime Minister, and whilst opposing",31
NA,his proposals-becaus e I did not approve,31
NA,of any proclamation being issued calling,31
NA,up the men before the referendum was,31
NA,submitted to the people and decided by,31
NA,arthem- I suggested that this should be,31
NA,considered a national question. I saw,31
NA,"that danger might arise in two ways, and",31
NA,I wanted to avoid that danger in the in-,31
NA,terests of the Empire. I felt it would,31
NA,be better if permission could be given to,31
NA,"members of the party, who evidently were",31
NA,"divided in opinion on the subject, to use",31
NA,"their own judgment in connexion with i t ,",31
NA,"and the Prime Minister did, at our re-",31
NA,"quest, consent to go to the executives to",31
NA,put that view before them. He did wait,31
NA,"upon the executives, and, as we know,",31
NA,the executives did not approve of that,31
NA,action.,31
NA,NA,31
Mr CHARLTON ,"Yes , and we then",31
NA,"had to go to the country, though many,",31
NA,"like myself, did not approve of members'",31
NA,rights being curtailed in regard to their,31
NA,view of this important question. I told,31
NA,"the Prime Minister, however, that I was",31
NA,"prepared, now that a decision had been",31
NA,arrived ai;-althoug h I did not vote with,31
NA,the majority - to stand in with,31
NA,"the majority, as I have always done,",31
NA,and no party can exist unless you have,31
NA,solidarity in connexion with these mat-,31
NA,ters. The result of the discussion was,31
NA,that we went to the people. I went before,31
NA,"my constituents. I addressed, I suppose,",31
NA,three of the largest meetings that I have,31
NA,ever addressed on - the South Maitland,31
NA,field. At each meeting I was asked.,31
NA,"""Are you prepared to follow the Prime",31
NA,Minister after tlie referendum has been,32
NA,"decided ?"" I said, "" So long as the Prime",32
NA,Minister is the accredited Leader of the,32
NA,"Labour party I w i l l loyally follow him,",32
NA,"as I have done i n the past."" I stood to",32
NA,"that statement, and.had the Prime Minis-",32
NA,ter remained within the movement to t r y,32
NA,"to alleviate matters, he would have had",32
NA,no stronger supporter than myself in that,32
NA,direction. But when I had to choose be-,32
NA,tween the Prime Minister's refusal to put,32
NA,to the party an amendment dealing w i th,32
NA,"this position, and his walking out of the",32
NA,"room, asking those who were prepared to",32
NA,"go with him to follow, then I severed my",32
NA,"connexion w i t h the Prime Minister, be-",32
NA,- cause I am loyal to my party still. These,32
NA,are the bare facts.,32
Mr WEBSTER ,Yo u know why he,32
NA,not put the amendment.,32
NA,"Mr CHARLTON "" - I do not.",32
Mr WEBSTER ,What !,32
NA,Minister said that he did not put the,32
NA,amendment because men had come there,32
NA,"tied, and were not free to vote.",32
Mr CHARLTON , I believe that i f,32
NA,"the amendment I had moved, with the",32
NA,"view to bring about a reconciliation, had",32
NA,"been put, and the Prime Minister had",32
NA,"risen, as of yore, and spoken strongly i n",32
NA,"support of i t , a majority of the members",32
NA,"would have stood by him, i n order to",32
NA,meet the State executives i n Inter-State,32
NA,"conference to discuss the matter, and see",32
NA,i f we could not come to an arrangement.,32
NA,NA,32
NA,cided to cut his throat.,32
Mr CHARLTON , I w i l l not discuss,32
NA,that question. That is tlie mistake which,32
NA,was made. I am putting the facts just,32
NA,"as they occurred, because there has been",32
NA,very much said here on the subject. I,32
NA,"want to leave the matter at that, because",32
NA,I have no ill-feeling towards the Prime,32
NA,Minister or any other honorable member.,32
NA,I wish to say a few words now in re-,32
NA,gard to the honorable member for Fawk-,32
NA,ner. So far as my recollection,32
NA,he has been consistent throughout i n,32
NA,his attitude to conscription. I,32
NA,"this, too, fo r that honorable member:",32
NA,He often defended the Government,32
NA,"i t was not to his own advantage, because",32
NA,he was loyal to them outside and here.,32
Mr FENTON , A n d particularly,32
NA,Prime Minister.,32
Mr CHARLTON ,"Yes . Further, he everv honorable member.",32
NA,was an anti-conscriptionist f r o m the,32
NA,first time that conscription was men-,32
NA,"tioned. He never supported, i n any shape",32
NA,"or form , the idea of conscription, or even",32
NA,the proposal to submit ib to the people.,32
NA,He was against the taking of a referen-,32
NA,dum. He and I differed right through the,32
NA,"piece i n that regard, because I believed",32
NA,"i n the taking of a referendum, but not i n",32
NA,the issue of the proclamation fo r home,32
NA,service.,32
Mr WEBSTER ,Th e Labour executive,32
NA,had already spoken.,32
Mr CHARLTON , N o ; do not do an,32
NA,injustice to any man. I n regard to this,32
NA,"matter, the honorable member f o r Fawk-",32
NA,ner has been straightforward right,32
NA,through the piece. I want to make that,32
NA,point quite clear.,32
NA,did,32
Mr MATHEWS ,The y cannot besmirch,32
NA,him i n any way.,32
Mr CHARLTON ,Nobod y can be-,32
NA,smirch the honorable member for Fawk-,32
NA,"ner, because he has pursued an honorable",32
NA,course throughout.,32
NA,"I come now to the other matter,",32
NA,and I think ib will be generally agreed,32
NA,"that, as regards the remarks I am going",32
NA,"to make, I cannot be charged with mak-",32
NA,ing a statement to suit the occasion. I,32
NA,refer to the decision of the Government,32
NA,not to agree to the appointment of a Com-,32
NA,"mission consisting of H i g h Court Judges,",32
NA,for the purpose of dealing with the state-,32
NA,"ment of Senator Watson i n the Senate,",32
NA,and the Ready charges. Even at this late,32
NA,"dehour, honorable members on the other side",32
NA,would do well to think before they go,32
NA,further. What are the Government,32
NA,doing? The Prime Minister has said to,32
NA,"Senator Watson, '.' Whilst I will nob grant",32
NA,a Commission composed of Judges of the,32
NA,High Court for the purpose of sifting,32
NA,your statements and -the Ready disappear-,32
NA,"ing trick, I am going to take oub a w r it",32
NA,"against you, claiming Â£5,000 damages.""",32
Mr WEBSTER ,No .,32
Mr CHARLTON , I am only stating,32
NA,"goes, what the newspaper reported.",32
Mr MANIFOLD ,Th e newspaper says,32
NA,w i l l say that no sum is mentioned.,32
Mr CHARLTON , I stand corrected.,32
NA,when The Prime Minister said that he was,32
NA,going to take out a writ against Senator,32
NA,Watson claiming damages. What does i t,32
NA,the mean? I n the coming campaign i t will,32
NA,have the effect of tving bhe tongue of,32
NA,The case,32
NA,very against Senator Watson can be pub off,32
NA,i n tlie Court month after month. I t need,33
NA,not be dealt with at all until the elections,33
NA,"have been concluded. I t is sub judice,",33
NA,and any honorable member who says any-,33
NA,thing reflecting on the case is liable to,33
NA,find himself served with a subpoena to,33
NA,appear before the Court. No member of,33
NA,Parliament should be asked to appear i n,33
NA,a Court to answer for any statement of,33
NA,his which he believed to be i n the public,33
NA,interest.,33
Mr WEBSTER ,D o you think that i t,33
NA,was made i n the public interest ?,33
Mr CHARLTON ,Th e very fact of,33
NA,the statement having been made by Sena-,33
NA,"tor Watson from his place i n the Senate,",33
NA,and that i t was relative to the position,33
NA,which obtained i n connexion with the Go-,33
NA,"vernment, made i t a public matter. He",33
NA,"spoke as a public man, and therefore he",33
NA,ought to have the privilege which every,33
NA,public man has within a Parliament. No-,33
NA,body can say thab I am bringing this,33
NA,matter up because Senator Watson hap-,33
NA,pens to be on my side i n politics. When,33
NA,the honorable member f o r Perth made,33
NA,the charges against Mr Chinn i n the,33
NA,"House, and I was sitting i n opposi-",33
NA,tion to h i m ; when members of our,33
NA,own party were telling that honorable,33
NA,member to make the charges outside,33
NA,so that Mr Chinn could take action,33
NA,"i f he so desired, I was the man who",33
NA,.stood up here and said that the hon-,33
NA,orable member was quite within his,33
NA,"rights, that a representative of bhe people",33
NA,had the right to make any statement i n,33
NA,his place under privilege with the view,33
NA,-to protect the public interest. I t cannot,33
NA,said that I have changed my mind i n,33
NA,any way. I f every time an honorable,33
NA,member says somthing which is offensive,33
NA,or derogatory to somebody he is to be,33
NA,"dragged into the Supreme Court, what",33
NA,is the good of Parliament? We might,33
NA,"just as well close i t up, for no honorable",33
NA,member would be safe. What will be-,33
NA,come of a member who has not 500 pence,33
NA,at his back i f he has to run the risk of,33
NA,being dragged into the Supreme Court,33
NA,because of some statement which he has,33
NA,made i n his public position ? The thing,33
NA,is really preposterous. I f a man makes,33
NA,a statement outside he takes the respon-,33
NA,"sibility of his utterance, but in this Cham-",33
NA,ber an honorable member should be p r i -,33
NA,vileged to speak as he pleases. We have,33
NA,that privilege. I do not know what Sena-,33
NA,"tor Watson will do, but I do not hesitate",33
NA,"to say that i f I were i n his place, I ,",33
NA,"as a representative of the people,",33
NA,would say what I thought was necessary,33
NA,if I believed the statement to be correct,33
NA,"and i n the interest of the public, and I",33
NA,would never go outside to appear in a,33
NA,Court i n connexion with my statement.,33
NA,"I would claim privilege every time, as I",33
NA,would have a perfect right to do.,33
NA,An HONORABLE MEMBEB - I t is very,33
NA,cowardly.,33
Mr CHARLTON , From the early,33
NA,days of the House of Commons every re-,33
NA,presentative of the people has had this,33
NA,privilege. I f the Government appoint a,33
NA,Commission consisting of High Court,33
NA,"Judges to go into the matter, surely no-",33
NA,body can take exception to them? They,33
NA,"would bring i n a decision, and i f i t re-",33
NA,flected upon Senator Watson he would,33
NA,carry that odium before the people f o r,33
NA,having made a statement i n which there,33
NA,was no truth . That is the position; there,33
NA,is no escape from i t .,33
Mr SAMPSON ,Withou t privilege we,33
NA,might as well shut up Parliament.,33
Mr CHARLTON , E x a c t l y ; that is,33
NA,my argument.,33
Mr WEBSTER ,D o you suggest sus-,33
NA,pending the Government while an inquiry,33
NA,of that kind is being held ?,33
Mr CHARLTON ,Th e Ministry are,33
NA,already suspended. I n a few weeks bhis,33
NA,moribund Government will have a dissolu-,33
NA,"tion, and must appeal to the people. The",33
NA,Houses will be sitting u n t i l the end of,33
NA,"next week. I believe that Judges, or a",33
NA,"Judge of the High Court, - ought to be",33
NA,"be called i n immediately, and an inquiry",33
NA,started next week. The Judges sliould,33
NA,"be asked to expedite their decision, and",33
NA,i t ought to be i n our possession within a,33
NA,couple of weeks. Then nobody could com-,33
NA,plain as to a fair appeal not being made,33
NA,when we appeared before the electors on,33
NA,this particular matter. Nobody will say,33
NA,that I am speaking now with any ill-feel-,33
NA,ing towards the Prime Minister. I have,33
NA,a very warm corner i n my heart for the,33
NA,right honorable gentleman by reason of,33
NA,the great work he has done f o r the Labour,33
NA,"movement. I know what he has done, I",33
NA,"know his work, and because I differ from",33
NA,"him on tliis question, I am not one who",33
NA,wishes to put a dagger into him. Onthe,33
NA,"other hand, I know the other man also.",33
NA,I know that Senator Watson is an upright,33
NA,"man, with an exemplary character, the",33
NA,same as the Prime Minister bears. Let a,33
NA,proper tribunal be appointed to sift this,33
NA,"matter, and i f i t is found that Senator",34
NA,Watson bas made any statements which,34
NA,"reflect on the Prime Minister, and which",34
NA,"are not i n accordance with the facts, he",34
NA,will carry the odium attaching to that,34
NA,offence. I would be sorry for any,34
NA,man who had to appear before the,34
NA,people i f a H i g h Court Judge had decided,34
NA,that he had done an i n j u ry to a man by,34
NA,statements he had made in Parliament.,34
NA,"I n sanctioning an inquiry by Judges, or",34
NA,"one Judge of tlie H i gh Court, the Go-",34
NA,vernment will only be doing what is right,34
NA,and just in the interests of members of,34
NA,this House. Possibly the people will come,34
NA,to the conclusion that Senator Wat-,34
NA,son is being cited to appear be-,34
NA,fore the Supreme Court for the purpose,34
NA,of keeping this matter i n suspense u n t i l,34
NA,after the appeal to the people has been,34
NA,made and in order to prevent honorable,34
NA,members from speaking. I f you take one,34
NA,"statement to the Supreme Court, you can-",34
NA,"not bring i n any outside matter, or any",34
NA,matter which may be indirectly relevant,34
NA,"to i t , f or the simple reason that you will",34
NA,be confined to the one issue before the,34
NA,Court. Where will the Ready dis-,34
NA,appearing trick go to? Can the Court,34
NA,deal with that matter ? Can any one give,34
NA,"evidence i n connexion with it? A f t e r all,",34
NA,the statement would not have been made,34
NA,by Senator Watson had i t not been for,34
NA,Senator Ready disappearing from the,34
NA,arena of politics.,34
Mr MATHEWS ,Yo u cannot disconnect,34
NA,the two.,34
Mr CHARLTON , N o . B u t i f you,34
NA,go to the Court i n regard to one,34
NA,"statement, you will be confined to",34
NA,ifc. I f fche Government desire to,34
NA,"do the fair and honorable thing, they",34
NA,must appoint a Commission of Judges from,34
NA,the High Court to deal with the Watson,34
NA,"and Ready cases, and clear the atmo-",34
NA,"sphere, and let the public know that",34
NA,everything is right. I speak with feeling,34
NA,on this matter. I have been i n public,34
NA,"life f or twelve years and a half, and I",34
NA,have never known anything like this to,34
NA,be alleged before. I have always en-,34
NA,deavoured to take a straight and honor-,34
NA,able path. I believe that other men who,34
NA,are concerned i n this matter have done,34
NA,"the same t h i n g ; but, evidently, there is a",34
NA,difference of opinion. Let the matter be,34
NA,settled by referring i t to a proper t r i -,34
NA,bunal. I t would be a preposterous posi-,34
NA,"tion for the House to say tliat, whenever",34
NA,a charge is levelled by a member against,34
NA,"the Government or the Prime Minister, or",34
NA,"a private member, he will have to waive",34
NA,privilege and go into the Supreme Court.,34
NA,I f that should ever become an established,34
NA,"fact in Australia, then good-bye to re-",34
NA,sponsible government; good-bye to poor,34
NA,men representing the people i n this,34
NA,Chamber. They would be less than use-,34
NA,less. They would not dare to open their,34
NA,mouths on any matter which they,34
NA,"thought vitally affected the public, i f",34
NA,"i t involved a reflection on somebody else,",34
NA,for i f they spoke they would have to r u n,34
NA,"the risk of losing their homes, and their",34
NA,wives and children might be rendered,34
NA,penniless i n order to meet the costs of an,34
NA,appeal to the Court.,34
Mr FENTON ,If c would afford a splen-,34
NA,did opportunity to blackmail members -,34
Mr CHARLTON ,Exactly . There,34
NA,can be no escape from that position.,34
NA,I wish to say a few words in regard to a,34
NA,"question which was asked last evening, be-",34
NA,"cause, i n these times, so much feeling is",34
NA,engendered. The question which was,34
NA,asked last night by the honorable member,34
NA,for Bourke i n regard to Senator Watson,34
NA,and Mr Baddeley waiting upon the Prime,34
NA,Minister seemed to me to be loaded. I n,34
NA,"view of the situation here, i t is only fair",34
NA,that I should narrate the facts as they,34
NA,occurred. That question was prompted,34
NA,by an individual who occupies - a very,34
NA,high place i n connexion with the northern,34
NA,coal trade. The question was based upon,34
NA,"suspicion, because he saw Senator Watson",34
NA,and Mr Baddeley come over i n fche same,34
NA,"train, and because Senator Watson went",34
NA,back last week i n the same train that Mr .,34
NA,Baddeley travelled i n . I wish to state,34
NA,"the facts, and the Prime Minister-i f he",34
NA,were here-woul d bear out my statement.,34
NA,I n the previous week.. Senator Watson,34
NA,"went home on Thursday, and on Friday",34
NA,I received from Mr Baddeley a wire ask-,34
NA,ing me i f I could arrange for a deputa-,34
NA,tion to the Prime Minister i n regard to,34
NA,troubles i n connexion with mining. I,34
NA,saw the Prime Minister sitting on the,34
NA,"other side, and the Acting Prime Minister",34
NA,was close to him. I went over and asked,34
NA,the Prime Minister i f he could meet the,34
NA,"deputation. He said, "" I do nofc know",34
NA,"what I will be doing next week, but i f I",34
NA,"am alive and well, and here, yes."" "" On",34
NA,"the strength of that statement,"" . I said,",34
NA,""" I will tell him to come over."" "" Very",34
NA,"w e l l , "" said the Prime Minister, "" he will",34
NA,"take the risk."" I said, "" I will",34
NA,"ask him to come."" H e came oyer",35
NA,on Wednesday by the same train as car-,35
NA,ried Mr John Brown and Senator Wat-,35
NA,"son. A f t e r luncheon I saw the latter, and",35
NA,told him that I had arranged that Mr .,35
NA,Baddeley should see the Prime Minister,35
NA,"on the Thursday or Friday, and that I",35
NA,would send for him ab the appointed time.,35
NA,"Until then, Senator Watson knew nothing",35
NA,of Mr Baddeley's visit. The Borehole,35
NA,"Seam mine a t Newcastle, the foreign",35
NA,"trade of the porb having fallen off, has",35
NA,"been slack, the mine working about two",35
NA,days a week. The Government is taking,35
NA,"a iarge quantity of coal, and we thought",35
NA,that i f we could get assistance for the,35
NA,"mines that are suffering, i t would be a",35
NA,"good thing. The Caledonian, the West",35
NA,"Wallsend, the Killingworth, and the South",35
NA,"Waratah mines have been doing worst,",35
NA,and we asked i f the Government could not,35
NA,give more coal orders to them. The M i n -,35
NA,ister for the Navy told us that the Go-,35
NA,"vernment had contracted to take 100,000",35
NA,tons of coal from the Caledonian mine,35
NA,"and 50,000 tons of coal from the Seaham",35
NA,"mine, but thafc they were not likely to need",35
NA,"all that coal, and, therefore, he was afraid",35
NA,that he could not give any help. The man,35
NA,who prompted the question asked in the,35
NA,"House is the proprietor of coal mines,",35
NA,"and has no love for the Caledonian mine,",35
NA,or any other in the Newcastle district.,35
NA,I mention these facts so that i t may not,35
NA,be thought that Senator Watson was endea-,35
NA,vouring to help one coal mine proprietor,35
NA,at the expense of another. I hope that a,35
NA,"tribunal will be appointed, consisting of",35
NA,"one or more Justices of the H i g h Court,",35
NA,to sift this matter. I n the interests of,35
NA,"Parliament and of all parties concerned,",35
NA,i t should be cleared up as early as possible.,35
NA,No honorable member has a right to be,35
NA,called on to forfeit his privileges and ex-,35
NA,pose himself to the cost of a legal action i n,35
NA,defence of anything thafc he mav say in,35
NA,"Parliament. I n my opinion, i t is cow-",35
NA,ardly fco t r y to drag an bonorable mem-,35
NA,ber into Court for something thafc he has,35
NA,said in Parliament. When the honorable,35
NA,member for Perth made his charges against,35
NA,"Mr Chinn, there were those i n my party,",35
NA,"which was then in power, who said that",35
NA,he should repeat his charges outside;'bufc,35
NA,"I contended that, as a representative of",35
NA,"the neople, he was privileged, and should",35
NA,not be expected to forego that privilege.,35
Mr MASSYGREENE ,The honorable,35
NA,for Perth did repeat his charges,35
NA,Mr Charlton.,35
Mr CHARLTON ,Yes ; but he,35
NA,should not have been asked to do so.,35
Mr MASSYGREENE ,H e was a man.,35
Mr CHARLTON ,Yes ; but he did,35
NA,not make his charges outside at the time,35
NA,I spoke of.,35
Mr MATHEWS , He did not make,35
NA,them i n connexion with the Supreme,35
NA,"Court action, but i n connexion with the",35
NA,Police Court action.,35
Mr MASSYGREENE ,H e did make them out-,35
NA,side.,35
Mr CHARLTON ,"Yes , but not at",35
NA,that time. I contended that he should,35
NA,not be asked to do that.,35
NA,I wish to repeat now what I have,35
NA,said on previous occasions regarding,35
NA,"the presentation of the Estimates,",35
NA,in fche hope that something may,35
NA,ultimatelv be done to improve matters. I,35
NA,"admit that the times are abnormal, and",35
NA,that the war has interfered with the. ad-,35
NA,"ministration of the various Departments,",35
NA,"but I do not think that any Department,",35
NA,"except the Defence Department, has been",35
NA,interfered with to such an extent as to,35
NA,make i t unable to present its Estimates,35
NA,afc least two months after the close of the,35
NA,financial year. Last year we did not get,35
NA,the Estimates until the year to which they,35
NA,"applied had expired, and we have not yet",35
NA,"got the Estimates for this year, which ex-",35
NA,pires at the end of June. Last year the,35
NA,financial statement was delivered i n May.,35
NA,Is i t a fair thing that the financial year,35
NA,should be nearly over before a statement,35
NA,is made to Parliament of tbe financial,35
NA,position of the country ? Surely the Esti-,35
NA,mates and the Treasurer's statement,35
NA,should be before Parliament early i n the,35
NA,year. I t is only after we have had the,35
NA,"financial statement, with an account of",35
NA,the revenue and expenditure of the coun-,35
NA,"try, and the Estimates, that we know",35
NA,where we are.,35
Mr MATHEWS ,Th e Treasurer would,35
NA,be superhuman who could do what you,35
NA,wish.,35
Mr CHARLTON , I am a member of,35
NA,a Committee that has examined the ex-,35
NA,"Secretary to the Treasurer, the present",35
NA,"Secretary, and the Auditor-General, of",35
NA,whom the first two say that there is no,35
NA,reason why the Estimates should not be,35
NA,presented early in the financial year.,35
Mr MATHEWS ,The y take no account,35
NA,of the political situation.,35
Mr CHARLTON , T h a t has little t o,35
NA,member do with i t - Parliament cannot control,35
NA,outside. the Administration of the country whep,35
NA,i t does not deal with the Estimates u n t,36
NA,most of the money provided for therein,36
NA,has been expended. During the year we,36
NA,spend week after week i n discussing Sup-,36
NA,"ply Bills, wasting time, and heaping up",36
NA,"expense i n printing and the like, when",36
NA,we could deal with the Estimates early,36
NA,"in the year, and do without Supplv Bills.",36
NA,The Treasurer tells us that there will be,36
NA,a great increase of expenditure this year.,36
NA,But we shall know little about the finan-,36
NA,cial position u n t i l we have received a,36
NA,complete statement. I admit that i t is not,36
NA,possible for him to do much at the pre-,36
NA,"sent time; but, as a general rule, Parlia-",36
NA,ment should be made acquainted eafly i n,36
NA,the year with the financial state of,36
NA,the country. We have voted a sum for,36
NA,"the establishment of Naval Bases, but we",36
NA,do not know anything as to the plans,36
NA,that are being adopted. We do not,36
NA,know how much of the money has been,36
NA,"spent, or how much of the work has been",36
NA,-completed. We are supposed to safe-,36
NA,"guard the Exchequer, and yet we get no",36
NA,information about these and other im-,36
NA,portant matters.,36
NA,NA,36
NA,a Supply and Tender Board.,36
Mr CHARLTON , I agree w itb tbe,36
NA,honorable member. During the short,36
NA,"time that he was in office, he did excel-",36
NA,"lent work; and, no doubt, had he re-",36
NA,"mained tliere, he would have tried to",36
NA,make an alteration. The present state of,36
NA,affairs cries aloud for redress. Intelli-,36
NA,gent men should not be asked to discuss,36
NA,"Supply Bills month after month, and",36
NA,then at the end of the year to sit up all,36
NA,night to deal with the Estimates. I f the,36
NA,Estimates were disposed of early i n the,36
NA,"year, there would be more time to deal",36
NA,with the general business of the country.,36
NA,I hopethat whoever may be Treasurer,36
NA,in the future will give consideration to,36
NA,"this matter, and furnish the Budget and",36
NA,Estimates within a reasonable period;,36
NA,"and, further, that the Estimates may be",36
NA,dealt with sufficiently early to make,36
NA,Supply Bills unnecessary -,36
NA,Sitting suspended from 6.27 to 7J/.5,36
NA,NA,36
NA,find i t difficult to understand why,36
NA,"political parties in"" the Commonwealth",36
NA,Parliament should be unable to drop,36
NA,their differences of opinion in order,36
NA,that a National Government might be,36
NA,formed to devote their energies to the,36
NA,"i l successful prosecution of the war, as has",36
NA,been done i n other parts of the Empire.,36
NA,I n the TJnited Kingdom we find that par-,36
NA,ties who have been opposed to each other,36
NA,"for generations, and who have viewed",36
NA,"each others' political ideals with hatred,",36
NA,dropped all their political differences at,36
NA,"the call to arms, -and formed themselves",36
NA,into a National Government to prosecute,36
NA,the war to the bitter end. I n the House,36
NA,"of Commons, previous to the war, there",36
NA,"was a combination of Liberals, National-",36
NA,ists and Labour members on the Govern-,36
NA,"ment side numbering 398, whilst the Con-",36
NA,servatives i n opposition numbered 272.,36
NA,"I n proportion to their numbers, the poli-",36
NA,tical parties are now represented i n a,36
NA,National Government of tlie TJnited,36
NA,Kingdom that is carrying on the govern-,36
NA,ment of the country i n this crisis to the,36
NA,satisfaction and admiration of the Em-,36
NA,pire. I n South Africa political differences,36
NA,of opinion are most marked. There is the,36
NA,"South African party of 54 members, the",36
NA,"Unionists of 40 members, the National-",36
NA,"ists of 27 members, a Labour .party of",36
NA,"4, and an Independent party of 5.",36
NA,Yet we learn that all these gentlemen,36
NA,find i t possible to see eye to eye i n the,36
NA,present great crisis. They dropped their,36
NA,"political differences, and since the war be-",36
NA,gan have loyally supported the Empire,36
NA,and the flag by forming a National Go-,36
NA,"vernment. I n Canada, there are 134 Con-",36
NA,servatives and 87 Liberals in the,36
NA,"Dominion House of Commons, and they",36
NA,have done the same. I n our neighbour-,36
NA,"ing Dominion of New Zealand, we find",36
NA,that Conservatives and Liberals have,36
NA,"dropped their political antipathies, and",36
NA,have formed themselves into one party f or,36
NA,the prosecution of the war.,36
Mr SAMPSON ,Ther e are no outside,36
NA,juntas there.,36
NA,NA,36
NA,common front to the common enemy.,36
Mr FENTON ,Canad a hae not done,36
NA,that.,36
NA,NA,36
NA,i t. During the last Commonwealth elec-,36
NA,"tions, shortly after the war broke out,",36
NA,p.m. members of the Labour party told the,36
NA,peopie throughout Australia that there,36
NA,"should net be an election. They said,",36
NA,""" Let us drop our political differences,",36
NA,"and form a National Government.""",36
Mr FENTON , I did not say that.,36
NA,NA,36
NA,"may not have said i t , but he knows as well",36
NA,as I do that i t was said. That was ad-,37
NA,mitted in this House. The suggestion was,37
NA,made that i n this Commonwealth we,37
NA,should drop party politics and form a,37
NA,National Government to prosecute the war,37
NA,to a successful issue.,37
Mr FENTON ,Wha t did the honorable,37
NA,member's party do? They spurned the,37
NA,"overtures, whatever they were.",37
NA,NA,37
NA,"fessed to desire a National Government,",37
NA,and there is no doubt that they made the,37
NA,suggestion that such a Government should,37
NA,be formed. I t was a party cry with them,37
NA,"at the elections, bufc they knew that at",37
NA,that time ifc was impossible.,37
Mr GROOM , Mr Fisher said that no,37
NA,suggestion was made.,37
NA,NA,37
NA,members of the Labour party put i t down,37
NA,"to Mr Hughes, but wherever I went",37
NA,"throughout my electorate, I heard that",37
NA,"suggestion made, and honorable members",37
NA,have only to look up the newspaper files of,37
NA,that time to find ample confirmation of my,37
NA,statement. Why did we not form a,37
NA,National Government ? Ifc was because,37
NA,"the writs of election had been issued, and",37
NA,there was no Government that could do,37
NA,"so. Still i t is very regrettable indeed, i n",37
NA,"my opinion, that we in this Parliament",37
NA,cannot see eye to eye at this particular,37
NA,juncture. I have looked through the,37
NA,financial statement with very great i n -,37
NA,"terest, and I congratulate the right honor-",37
NA,able member f o r Swan upon the introduc-,37
NA,"tion of such a concise, clear, and up-to-",37
NA,date statement. Even members of the,37
NA,House who have not had a long,37
NA,political experience are able to follow i t,37
NA,with ease. I n previous financial state-,37
NA,"ments, we have found the figures so",37
NA,"jumbled and mixed, that i t has been i m -",37
NA,possible to separate war expenditure from,37
NA,ordinary expenditure. This can be done,37
NA,at once i n the statement which the pre-,37
NA,sent Treasurer has introduced. I regret,37
NA,very much to find that the estimated ex-,37
NA,"penditure of the Commonwealth, other",37
NA,"than war expenditure, exceeds that of the",37
NA,"previous year by no less than Â£4,653,887.",37
NA,I t is time that we called a halt in such,37
NA,expenditure. We have enormous finan-,37
NA,cial responsibilities to meet i n this time of,37
NA,"war, and we should curtail the ordinary",37
NA,expenditure of the Commonwealth ag much,37
NA,as possible. I f the estimated expenditure,37
NA,amounted to no more than that for last,37
NA,"year, there might perhaps be nothing to",37
NA,cavil a t ; but when such an increase as I,37
NA,"have mentioned is shown, i t is time that",37
NA,we gave very serious consideration to the,37
NA,matter. Looking through the items of,37
NA,"estimated' expenditure from revenue, not",37
NA,"including war expenditure, I find that the",37
NA,"sum of Â£2,081,510 is to be spent on",37
NA,"capital works, and that the increase i n",37
NA,expenditure upon ordinary new works is,37
NA,"estimated at Â£499,292. I n my opinion,",37
NA,"these works, most of which are connected",37
NA,"with the Naval Bases, should be very",37
NA,largely suspended. We are spending,37
NA,thousands of pounds i n building Naval,37
NA,"Bases, ostensibly for the purpose of ac-",37
NA,"commodating our Fleet, whilst our Fleet",37
NA,"is i n the North Sea, and we have not a",37
NA,single battleship here. I t is time that we,37
NA,"called a halt, and decided to build our",37
NA,Naval Bases later on. We do not know,37
NA,where this expenditure is to end. I find,37
NA,thafc i n the estimates for new works for,37
NA,"1916-17, an amount of Â£1,025,530 is ""set",37
NA,down f or Naval works.,37

NA,should be suspended u n t i l the war is over.,37
NA,Every penny we can conserve should be,37
NA,ear-marked at this time f or one purpose.,37
NA,"We have only one thing to consider, and",37
NA,"that is the war, and nothing but the war.",37
NA,I have noticed with satisfaction the fol-,37
NA,lowing statement by the Treasurer: -,37
NA,At the recent Conference of Premiers the,37
NA,following particulars were given:-,37
NA,Estimated number of soldiers who' can be,37
NA,settled on the land-,37
NA,"Up to 30th June, 1917 . . 2,400",37
NA,"Up to 30th June, 1918 . . .11.000",37
NA,"Up to 30th June, 1919 . . 13,600",37
NA,Total number of settlers in,37
NA,"three years .. . . 27,000",37
NA,Amount said to be required by States for,37
NA,"land settlement, irrespective of purchase of",37
NA,land-,37
NA,"Up to 30th June, 1917 .. Â£1.250,000",37
NA,"Up to 30th June; 1918 .. Â£8.447,000",37
NA,"Up to 30th June, 1919 .. Â£9,245,000",37
NA,Total amount for three,37
NA,"years .. .. Â£18,942,000",37
NA,I am quite sure thafc every honorahle,38
NA,member will agreefchafcthis is proper ex-,38
NA,penditure. The people of Australia will,38
NA,"nofc mind being taxed, so long as ample",38
NA,and adequate provision is made for the,38
NA,brave boys who have risked everything for,38
NA,tlie cause of tho Empire. There is another,38
NA,paragraph of the Treasurer's statement,38
NA,"for which, I think, the primary producers",38
NA,of Australia will thank the right honor-,38
NA,able gentleman. H e says-,38
NA,Information recently supplied to the,38
NA,sury shows that the cash payments already,38
NA,made to farmers on account of last season's,38
NA,"wheat may be taken as Â£24,200,000. As the",38
NA,"balance of the crop has now been disposed of,",38
NA,"further payments of Â£8,000,000 may be ex-",38
NA,pected.,38
NA,There is a feeling of discontent amongst,38
NA,the farmers of Australia. Let me say,38
NA,that the men whom we should encourage,38
NA,more than any one else i n Australia are,38
NA,"fche primary producers. I find, according",38
NA,"to Mr Knibbs' figures, that i n 1914-15,",38
NA,the area under wheat i n the CommonTreasurer,38
NA,"wealth was 9,651,081 acres; 1915-16,",38
NA,"area was 12,530,721 acres; and i n 1917,",38
NA,"the area was 11,524,031 acres. That",38
NA,"to say, that for these three years, the light",38
NA,aggregate area cultivated for wheat was,38
NA,"33,705,833 acres. According to the New",38
NA,"South Wales Agricultura l Department,",38
NA,the expense involved i n the cultivation of any one.,38
NA,land amounts to Â£ 2 0s. 6d. per acre. We,38
NA,farmers consider that a fair cost is 35s.,38
NA,per acre. I f we multiply the total area,38
NA,I have quoted for the three years men-,38
NA,"tioned by 35s., we shall find that",38
NA,"Â£58,985,607 15s. was spent upon the",38
NA,cultivation of the wheat lands of,38
NA,Australia in those three years.,38
NA,"The yield for the year 1914-15, unfor-",38
NA,"tunately a bad year for the farmers, was",38
NA,"24,892,402 bushels, for which the farmers",38
NA,"received Â£7,500,000. The yield for",38
NA,"1915-16 was 179,fi24.183 bushels, for",38
NA,"which, at the rate of 3s. 6d. per bushel,",38
NA,less about 6d. per bushel which was de-,38
NA,"ducted for expenses, the farmers received",38
NA,"Â£27,000,000. The yield for 1916-17 was",38
NA,"143,475,516 bushels, for which the far-",38
NA,"mers have received Â£18,000,000. For the",38
NA,three years the farmers have received,38
NA,"Â£52,500,000, whereas the cost of cultiva-",38
NA,"tion bas been Â£58.985,607. This shows",38
NA,"a net loss of Â£6,485,607, which has been",38
NA,met by advances from financial institu-,38
NA,"tions, banks, and private persons who",38
NA,have come to the assistance of t h e ' f a r -,38
NA,mers. There is a great shortage of food-,38
NA,[400],38
NA,stuffs throughout the world. England is,38
NA,particularly desirous of getting as much,38
NA,"wheat as she can. Therefore, we should",38
NA,above all things encourage the farming,38
NA,industry. The farmer does not need,38
NA,"much urging. The Treasurer says, i n his",38
NA,"financial statement, "" As the balance of",38
NA,"fche crop has now been disposed of, f u r -",38
NA,"ther payments of Â£8,000,000 may be ex-",38
NA,"pected."" A small deputation of honor-",38
NA,able members waited on him this after-,38
NA,"Trea- noon, and he gave i t most sympathetic",38
NA,consideration. I understand that he has,38
NA,made an arrangement with the Governor,38
NA,of the Commonwealth Bank so that the,38
NA,farmers may receive an extra instalment,38
NA,by way of advance on their wheat crop.,38
NA,When the farmers were asked to go into,38
NA,"the Wheat Pool with their 1915-16 crop,",38
NA,they were informed that payment would,38
NA,"be made on the 30th November last, but,",38
NA,"so far, they have only received an instal-",38
NA,ment of the amount that they were pro-,38
NA,"mised. Therefore, I am pleased tbat the",38
NA,"is considering their position,",38
NA,the and is guarding their interests. Before,38
NA,"we prorogue, i t is possible that we may",38
NA,is take action towards repealing the Day-,38
NA,"Saving B i l l , which is nofc acceptable",38
NA,"to fche people i n country districts, nor, I",38
NA,"believe, to many people i n the cities.",38
Mr BURNS , I t is not acceptable to,38
NA,NA,38
NA,"like a flash. I put my watch on i t , and",38
NA,found that the measure passed through,38
NA,this House i n five minutes. Every hon-,38
NA,"orable member on both sides voted f or ifc,",38
NA,so thafc the responsibility rests on the,38
NA,"whole Parliament, and not on any par-",38
NA,ticular party. I was thunderstruck tne,38
NA,other day when the Leader of the Oppo-,38
NA,sition said that the duty on cornsacks,38
NA,"should be repealed, seeing that he im-",38
NA,posed the duty when he was Minister for,38
NA,Trade and Customs. I appealed to him,38
NA,"repeatedly to remove that duty, but his",38
NA,replies were always most unsympathetic.,38
NA,"Last night, when the honorable member",38
NA,"for Echuca twitted h i m on the point,",38
NA,"he denied the statement, and said that",38
NA,the responsibility for imposing the duty,38
NA,rested on the Fisher Government. Hon-,38
NA,orable members will find from Hansard,38
NA,that a vote was taken on the matter on,38
NA,"the 27th August, 1915, and thafc the hon-",38
NA,orable member for Yarr a was among,38
NA,those who voted that the duty should be,38
NA,continued. This duty caused so much,38
NA,concern to the farmers that they formed,38
NA,a deputation and waited on the honor-,39
NA,able member when he was Minister for,39
NA,"Trade and Customs, but they got very",39
NA,little satisfaction for their trouble. M i n-,39
NA,"isters, as we know-an d i t is not confined",39
NA,to Labour Ministers-ca n appear very sym-,39
NA,"pathetic, and can smile very nicely when",39
NA,"they receive deputations, but those who",39
NA,wait on them get very little satisfaction,39
NA,from them. I t is a very important ques-,39
NA,"tion. I n 1915-16 we imported Â£3,908,350",39
NA,"worth of jute goods, and the 10 per cent,",39
NA,duty which was imposed upon them,39
NA,meant a direct tax of something like,39
NA,"Â£400,000 on the farmers in that period.",39
NA,I am sorry that the Leader of the Oppo-,39
NA,sition is nut present.,39
Mr BURNS ,I will bring him in if,39
NA,you like. We should have a quorum.,39
NA,[Quorum formed:],39
NA,NA,39
NA,wheu the graziers and farmers were at,39
NA,their wits' end to know where to get,39
NA,"fodder, deputation after deputation",39
NA,waited on the honorable member f o r,39
NA,Yarra when he was Minister for Trade and,39
NA,"Customs, urging him to remit the fodder",39
NA,"duties, but he gave us no satisfaction.",39
NA,Some months later he came to the Houso,39
NA,and informed honorable members that,39
NA,he had removed the fodder duties. I t was,39
NA,"not done at the request of the graziers,",39
NA,but at the request of a number of cab-,39
NA,"drivers living i n his electorate, who,",39
NA,finding that they could not run their cabs,39
NA,"owing to the high price of fodder, waited",39
NA,on the Minister and asked him to do what,39
NA,ho 'had refused to do f o r the greatest i n -,39
NA,dustry i n Australia. The graziers and,39
NA,farmers could go hang so f a r as the,39
NA,"Minister was concerned, but he acted at",39
NA,once when a handful of cab-drivers came,39
NA,to him. When we were discussing the,39
NA,B i l l dealing with the Industrial Workers,39
NA,"of the World , the honorable member f o r",39
NA,Yarra insulted the fruit-growers and,39
NA,fishermen of Australia. He said that,39
NA,they were just as bad as members of the,39
NA,Industrial Workers of the World . He,39
NA,said that because a great many fishermen,39
NA,"allowed a lot of their fish to rot, i n order",39
NA,"that they might not glut the market, they",39
NA,were just as bad as members of the I n -,39
NA,dustrial Woi'kers of the Worl d who,39
NA,burnt property i n Sydney.,39
Mr FINLAYSON, -S o they are.,39
NA,NA,39
NA,the fishermen are dealing with their,39
NA,property whereas the members of the I n -,39
NA,dustrial Workers of the World are burn-,39
NA,ing other people's property. I have a,39
NA,great many fruit-growers i n my elec-,39
NA,"torate, and they watch the market very",39
NA,closely. I f they have a lot of ripe f r u i t,39
NA,they do not glut the market w i th,39
NA,"i t , but keep half of i t back to rot",39
NA,or use otherwise. I t is better f o r,39
NA,them to supply just what the market can,39
NA,"absorb, so that they can obtain a f a i r",39
NA,price. The honorable member was wrong,39
NA,in comparing hard-working honest men,39
NA,w i th members of the Industrial Workers,39
NA,of the World. The honorable inember f o r,39
NA,Y a r ra took exception to any suggestion,39
NA,for the exemption of fruit-growers under,39
NA,the proposed war-time profits taxation.,39
NA,"Wheat-growers were exempted, but not",39
NA,"fruit-growers, and the honorable member",39
NA,argued that fruit-growers were making,39
NA,fortunes since the outbreak of the war be-,39
NA,cause jam was fetching a very big price.,39
NA,On the day on which the honorable mem-,39
NA,ber made that statement I looked up the,39
NA,quotations i n the files i n the Library,39
NA,"to see what f r u i t was realizing, and I",39
NA,compared the prices given with those,39
NA,prevailing i n the market on the,39
NA,same date i n a year prior to the outbreak,39
NA,of the war. Under nine different head-,39
NA,ings of f r u i t there were three lots-bes t,39
NA,"quality, second grade, and third grade.",39
NA,I n those twenty-seven items there was,39
NA,only -id. a case difference between the,39
NA,prices i n November of last year and the,39
NA,November before the war. Yet the honor-,39
NA,able member f o r Y a r ra says that these,39
NA,"men should be taxed heavily, because they",39
NA,are making fortunes out of the war.,39
Mr MAHON ,Kalgoorlie) [8.15] -,39
NA,I n some quarters surprise has been ex-,39
NA,pressed that a motion of no-confidence,39
NA,has not been proposed i n this Govern-,39
NA,ment. B u t that would be quite super-,39
NA,Sous. I t is obvious that what Disraeli,39
NA,said of another immoral political combina-,39
NA,"tion, that they have no confidence i n",39
NA,"each other, is quite true of them. How-",39
NA,"ever, I did not rise altogether to con-",39
NA,"demn the Ministry, because they have, at",39
NA,"any rate, exhibited some death-bed cour-",39
NA,age. Doubtless they did not mean to ap-,39
NA,"peal to the country, but circumstances",39
NA,proved too strong f o r the intrigue which,39
NA,wasbeing carried on to extend the l i f e,39
NA,own of Parliament. I have heard a' good deal,39
NA,about the story of the Labour party's par-,40
NA,"ticipation i n this proposal, and the voci-",40
NA,ferous Postmaster-General,40
NA,drove me out of the chamber by his noisy,40
NA,endeavour bo prove that the Labour party,40
NA,was responsible for that extraordinary,40
NA,"proceeding. The most that he, or",40
NA,"anybody else, can show is that the",40
NA,Labour party desired to avoid the,40
NA,expense of a double election i n the,40
NA,present year. A l l they sought was to,40
NA,extend the lif e of the Senate u n t i l the,40
NA,natural time f o r the expiration of the,40
NA,House of Represen tatives.,40
Mr WEBSTER ,The y agreed to extend,40
NA,both to the June following October next.,40
Mr MAHON ,Pardo n me. I know,40
NA,"quite well what was done, and there was",40
NA,never any proposal to extend the life of,40
NA,Parliament until next June twelve,40
NA,months. Some speakers seem to think i t,40
NA,is a matter of reproach that we should,40
NA,have been willin g to appeal to the I m -,40
NA,perial Government to amend our Con-,40
NA,"stitution, and a leading newspaper i n this",40
NA,city made the extraordinary statement,40
NA,that i t would be f a r better to see the six,40
NA,capital cities burnt to the ground than,40
NA,that the Australian Constitution should,40
NA,be amended by an outside authority. That,40
NA,kind of argument does not greatly appeal,40
NA,"to me, because the authority that created",40
NA,the Australian Constitution must neces-,40
NA,sarily have the power to amend i t . I n any,40
NA,"case, I can see nothing wrong i n both",40
NA,Houses of this Parliament approaching,40
NA,the Imperial Parliament to make such,40
NA,an amendment. There is no surrender,40
NA,of our self-governing rights i n a proceed-,40
NA,"ing of that kind. A f t e r all, what we",40
NA,"have to ask is, "" Is i t for the benefit of",40
NA,Australia? Is i t i n the interests of the,40
NA,Australian people that this thing should,40
NA,"be done?"" And i t is absolutely unthink-",40
NA,able that both Houses of this Parliament,40
NA,should request the Imperial Government,40
NA,to do something which would be inimical,40
NA,to the interests of Australia. That kind,40
NA,"of argument, therefore, falls to",40
NA,ground.,40
Mr RODGERS ,Som e very good argu-,40
NA,ments to the contrary were given by your,40
NA,friends on the other side.,40
NA,"Mr MAHON "" - I have not heard them.",40
NA,"Perhaps the honorable member, when he",40
NA,rises to throw light on the various sub-,40
NA,"jects with which we are wrestling, w i l l",40
NA,[400]- 2,40
NA,quote some of the remarks to which he re-,40
NA,"fers. A t any rate, I am not committed to",40
NA,last night the opinions i n question. I express only,40
NA,my own-fo r what they are worth. The,40
NA,Prime Minister seems to want to fasten,40
NA,upon his opponents the stigma of making,40
NA,an unprecedented personal attack upon,40
NA,him. The extraordinary somersaults,40
NA,which that gentleman has performed,40
NA,naturally call forth some criticism,40
NA,"fro m his opponents, but I have not",40
NA,"seen i n any of the so-called "" attacks """,40
NA,upon him anything so severe as the,40
NA,attacks made upon other leaders of parties,40
NA,in this Parliament during ' the last,40
NA,sixteen years. I do not think there is,40
NA,anything i n the alleged assaults upon the,40
NA,Prime Minister to equal the attacks made,40
NA,"upon Sir George Reid, f o r instance, dur-",40
NA,ing his term as Opposition Leader and,40
NA,Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is,40
NA,suffering from what may be called the,40
NA,"exaggerated ego, that is to say, he",40
NA,"imagines, since his visit to Great Britain ,",40
NA,that the eyes of the whole planet are,40
NA,"centred upon him, and that any criti-",40
NA,"cism of h i m is a criminal offence, which",40
NA,ought to mean the obliteration of his op-,40
NA,"ponents. H e and his colleague, the Post-",40
NA,"master-General, have referred to the",40
NA,"""junta."" Speaking of the Postmaster-",40
NA,"General, I am reminded that, up to the",40
NA,"time he took office, nobody ever saw h i m",40
NA,smile. Since he has been i n office nobody,40
NA,"has seen h i m do anything else, except",40
NA,"when the postal officials call, by way of",40
NA,"deputation, to remind h i m of so many of",40
NA,his unfulfilled promises. W i l l the honor-,40
NA,able gentleman tell me that the constitu-,40
NA,"tion of the so-called "" j u n t a "" differs i n any",40
NA,degree f r o m what i t was when he was one,40
NA,of its obedient servants'?,40
Mr WEBSTER ," I never obeyed, except",40
NA,according to my pledge and platform.,40
Mr MAHON , T h e honorable gentle-,40
NA,man knows that he would never be on,40
NA,"that bench i f i t were not for the "" junta """,40
NA,he so freely denounces. The Prime M i n -,40
NA,"the ister, too, talks about this "" j u n t a , "" but",40
NA,"while i t was doing his bidding, or work-",40
NA,"ing in conjunction with him, he had no",40
NA,word of condemnation for i t . The,40
NA,""" junta "" does not now differ from what",40
NA,"it always was. I f i t be evil now, i t was",40
NA,no less evil when the Prime Minister,40
NA,"obeyed i t . I n this connexion, a certain",40
NA,incident may be recalled. A n honorable,40
NA,"member, i n the presence of the present",40
NA,"Prime Minister, asked the chairman of the",41
NA,"party, "" Supposing I have made a promise dum on i t .",41
NA,"to my electors, and something which I am",41
NA,commanded to do hy the party conflicts,41
NA,"with that promise, whom am i to obey?"" courage and determination.",41
NA,The answer given by the chairman of,41
NA,"party, with the knowledge and connivance",41
NA,"of the present Prime Minister, was, "" You",41
NA,"must follow what the party declares,",41
NA,not what you have promised your constiUlster.,41
NA,"tuents."" The whole essence of represenMinister",41
NA,tative government was vitiated by that,41
NA,declaration.,41
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Mor e revelations!,41
Mr MAHON , I should like to hear,41
NA,the Treasurer's revelations concerning,41
NA,some of his present colleagues. They,41
NA,would be quite as interesting as any that,41
NA,I could tell the Commmittee. I should like,41
NA,"his private opinion, for instance, of his",41
NA,"present leader, who called him a troglo-",41
NA,dyte.,41
Sir JOHN FORREST ,"H e did, but i",41
NA,not true.,41
Mr MAHON , I know i t was not-,41
NA,then. I t was one of the many libels of,41
NA,which the right honorable gentleman has,41
NA,been a victim during his political career.,41
NA,But one cannot help commenting on the,41
NA,extraordinary position which he occupies,41
NA,"to-night, following, as he does, a leader",41
NA,who had such an opinion of him as to,41
NA,that he belonged to the age of troglodytes.,41
NA,The right honorable gentleman has forglad,41
NA,"given his traducers, apparently.",41
NA,said that charity covers a multitude,41
NA,"sins, and the right honorable gentleman the people.",41
NA,"covers so much superficial' area that,",41
NA,"doubt, there is some charity beneath",41
NA,where he stands..,41
NA,Another gentleman supporting this,41
NA,"vernment, who, to my amazement, was",41
NA,"left out of i t , is the honorable member",41
NA,"for Flinders. I f there is a """,41
NA,"hogger "" i n this House or the country",41
NA,"win-the-war patriot, i t is the honorable",41
NA,gentleman. I f this is a,41
NA,vernment- a Government formed exclu-,41
NA,sively to press on' with the war-wh,41
NA,he been omitted from i t ? Is ifc because he,41
NA,said he was in favour of another,41
NA,dum on the conscription issue ? Was he,41
NA,excluded because the members of the Go-,41
NA,vernment were afraid of the company of,41
NA,one who alone had the courage to say what,41
NA,they all thought? From his point of Public,41
NA,"view, he is quite right. I f he believes",41
NA,"conscription to be of supreme importance,",41
NA,he is right i n advocating another referen-,41
NA,I t would make for more,41
NA,healthy public life i f others on his side,41
NA,would express their opinions with equal,41
NA,Not long,41
NA,"the ago, when the honorable member was",41
NA,Attorney-General i n a previous Govern-,41
NA,"ment, the present Prime Minister referred",41
NA,"and to him as following the "" red hand "" of",41
NA,I t is to be feared that the Prime,41
NA,knows very little about the legend,41
NA,"of the "" r e d h a n d "" of Ulster. But ,",41
NA,"whatever its signification may be, the",41
NA,Prime Minister is forced now to let the,41
NA,"""red h a n d "" of Ulster point out the",41
NA,"way that he must go. Because, unless",41
NA,"I am very much mistaken, i t is the",41
NA,honorable member for Flinders that,41
NA,will dictate to the Government their,41
NA,policy i n military and other matters.,41
NA,"The appeal to the country is welcome,",41
NA,for the country ought to have an,41
NA,t was opportunity to express some opinion,41
NA,on recent incidents i n connexion with,41
NA,Parliament. I suppose that nothing,41
NA,more extraordinary has ever occurred,41
NA,in Federal or State politics than the dis-,41
NA,"appearance of a senator at night, and the",41
NA,appearance of his successor first thing i n,41
NA,the morning. This promptitude is not,41
NA,characteristic of Government depart-,41
NA,ments; and there are circumstances con-,41
NA,say nected with the occurrence on which I,41
NA,think the people of the country will be,41
NA,to have the opportunity to express an,41
NA,"I t is opinion. Of course, there are many other",41
NA,of matters which ought to be submitted to,41
NA,"For instance, there is a",41
NA,no motion on the notice-paper by the Trea-,41
NA,surer; and I suppose that many of his,41
NA,"supporters, who have gone from the",41
NA,"GoLabour party, will be interested to learn",41
NA,-that he proposes to abolish preference to,41
NA,unionists in the Government service. The,41
NA,wholeother day I asked the right honorable,41
NA,as a gentleman when he proposed to proceed,41
NA,"with the motion, and I received from him",41
NA,Win-the-war Goan evasive answer.,41
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Yo u did not give,41
NA,y has me notice of the question.,41
Mr MAHON ,Th e Treasurer has,41
NA,referengiven notice to move-,41
NA,That this House disallows the regulation,41
NA,"(Statutory Rules 1915, No. 127) laid upon",41
NA,"tlie table of the House on 28th July, 1915,",41
NA,"amending regulation 121, framed under the",41
NA,"Service Act, and providing, amongst",41
NA,"other matters, that- "" In the selection of tem-",41
NA,"porary assistance under section 40 of the Act,",41
NA,"preference shall be given, other things being",41
NA,"equal, to the persons whose names are on the",42
NA,register in the State in which such assistance,42
NA,"is required, and who are members of a trade",42
NA,"union or industrial organization.""",42
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Yo u do not believe,42
NA,"in that preference, do you ?",42
Mr MAHON ,Th e right honorable,42
NA,gentleman gave notice of that motion be-,42
NA,"fore, as he said last night, he unexpectedly",42
NA,attained office. I do not condemn the,42
NA,right honorable gentleman for his pro-,42
NA,"posal, in which he is quite consistent.",42
Sir JOHN FORREST ," I believe i n i t , or",42
NA,I should not move i t .,42
Mr MAHON , E x a c t l y ; but what,42
NA,"about, the late members of the Labour",42
NA,party who are now supporting the right,42
NA,honorable gentleman ?,42
Sir JOHN FORREST , I am,42
NA,keeper!,42
Mr MAHON , B u t those honorable,42
NA,"members are supporting the Government,",42
NA,and they must vote for the right honor-,42
NA,able gentleman's motion when i t comes to,42
NA,a division.,42
Sir JOHN FORREST , I do not thin k so -,42
Mr MAHON ,Perhap s some accident,42
NA,may occur to prevent the motion being,42
NA,submitted. Ministers are not as fre-,42
NA,quently in attendance as they should be.,42
NA,So much so that one has difficulty i n get-,42
NA,ting information required i n the public,42
NA,interest.,42
NA,NA,42
NA,forgets that when he was Minister he was,42
NA,away month after month.,42
Mr MAHON , N o t so. Whenever I,42
NA,"was absent, good reasons existed; but I",42
NA,am not too sure that any of the present,42
NA,Ministers have adequate reason for their,42
NA,abstention from the business for which,42
NA,they are paid.,42
Mr GROOM ,The y are away for public,42
NA,"reasons, attending to departmental busi-",42
NA,ness.,42
Mr MAHON , I understand that one,42
NA,of them is on a political mission i n Ade-,42
NA,laide.,42
Mr RILEY ,Ther e are two Ministers,42
NA,there.,42
Mr MAHON ,Tw o of them are there ?,42
NA,I understand that the Minister for Works,42
NA,"and Railways, from whom the Committee is",42
NA,entitled to information regarding national,42
NA,"works, is away on a political mission. I",42
NA,should have liked that honorable gentle-,42
NA,"man to be present, because some time ago",42
NA,he made a virulent attack on honorable,42
NA,"members on tbis side, and he ouehfc",42
NA,to be present to hear our retort.,42
NA,honorable member f or Capricornia was,42
NA,"most severely attacked; but, itbeing the",42
NA,"first time, I presume he thought he might",42
NA,let the attack pass. There is a legal fic-,42
NA,t i o n - I am sorry the lionorable member,42
NA,for Capricornia forgot it-tha t every dog,42
NA,is entitled to one free bite; and i t is pos-,42
NA,"sible that, on this account, he determined",42
NA,not to resent the attack made upon him by,42
NA,the honorable member f o r Balaclava.,42
Mr SINCLAIR ,"Yo u want your "" free",42
NA,"bite,"" too, apparently.",42
Mr MAHON , I should have been,42
NA,much more pleased to say what I have to,42
NA,say in the presence of the Minister con-,42
NA,"cerned, but, as this is the last opportunity",42
NA,many of us will have to address honorable,42
NA,"not their members before the dissolution, I may be",42
NA,allowed to say what I have to say with-,42
NA,out interruption from the honorable mem-,42
NA,ber f or Moreton. I am hopeful that there,42
NA,will be no more attempts to juggle with,42
NA,the electoral system of the country in the,42
NA,"way we saw some time ago, but that the",42
NA,elections will be carried out without any,42
NA,recriminations or personal attacks on,42
NA,either side. The people of this country,42
NA,ought to be'.able to give a verdict on the,42
NA,"issue between the two parties, free from",42
NA,the antagonism and rancours which elec-,42
NA,tion battles unfortunately are prone to,42
NA,"produce. A t any rate, 1 think I can pro-",42
NA,mise for honorable members on this side,42
NA,that we shall fight the battle as we have,42
NA,"always done, fairly and honorably, and",42
NA,"that i f we win, we shall come back as be-",42
NA,"fore, with clean hands prepared to do",42
NA,"what we have done i n the past, namely,",42
NA,carry legislation i n the best interests of,42
NA,Australia.,42
Mr LAIRD SMITH ,Denison) [8.37] -,42
NA,I desire to place my position not only be-,42
NA,"fore the Committee, but before the coun-",42
NA,"try. I n doing so, and i n dealing with the",42
NA,question of the extension of the life of Par-,42
NA,"liament, I shall say only what is i n my",42
NA,own m i n d; I know nothing of what is i n,42
NA,the minds of other people. What other,42
NA,people may think or believe does not mat-,42
NA,ter; all I know is that when I left the,42
NA,"meeting of the Labour party, I was of the",42
NA,"opinion that the Prime Minister, during",42
NA,"his visit to England, would, i f possible,",42
NA,get an extension of the life of Parliament,42
NA,"for about two years, or six months after",42
NA,the termination of fhe war. I left that,42
NA,"meeting with that idea i n my mind, and",42
NA,"I was prepared to stand by i t , and to ex-",42
NA,The plain to the electors why I was i n favour,42
NA,"of an extension. The Prime Minister, i n",43
NA,"my opinion, left that meeting, and went",43
NA,to Great Britain with the feeling that he,43
NA,had a unanimous following behind him on,43
NA,this question. I forget whether I signed,43
NA,"the document which has been referred to,",43
NA,but I know that I should willingly have,43
NA,"signed i t , and may have done so. How-",43
NA,"ever, the honorable member who referred",43
NA,"to i t has not the document with h i m , and",43
NA,I only wish he had; for what a disclosure,43
NA,i t would make! We should then see i n,43
NA,black and white how anxious members,43
NA,were for an extension of Parliament.,43
NA,Was that because we could hold on to our,43
NA,seats? No. W h y was it? I t was because,43
NA,"our brothers were at the f r o n t fighting,",43
NA,and because i t .was not the time f o r a gene-,43
NA,"ral election. H o w should I feel i f , when",43
NA,"addressing a political meeting, I were to",43
NA,get word that my brother had been killed,43
NA,at the front? Only two days ago I re-,43
NA,ceived a sad message of the k i n d ; and,43
NA,"how, under such circumstances, can we",43
NA,fight a political fight? These men at the,43
NA,"front have left us here to represent them,",43
NA,and look after the welfare of Australia.,43
NA,They expect on their return to find Aus-,43
NA,tralia as they left it-on e of the greatest,43
NA,countries on God's earth. They do not,43
NA,"expect to find a country f u l l of turmoil,",43
NA,"bitterness, and struggle-ma n against",43
NA,"man, woman against woman. A n d what",43
NA,is the struggle for? Por the purpose of,43
NA,"winning the war? No, Merely f o r the",43
NA,purpose of winning seats i n this Parlia-,43
NA,ment. I - ask any disinterested person,43
NA,whether i t is not cruel to ask a man to go,43
NA,"to the front , and leave Australia i n the",43
NA,hands of parties who are fighting as they,43
NA,never fought before ? This is going to be,43
NA,one of the most bitter of fights.,43
NA,NA,43
NA,to make i t bitter?,43
- Mr LAIRD SMITH , N o ; and I have,43
NA,never made a political fight bitter. Even,43
NA,my bitterest opponent in Denison knows,43
NA,that I always refused to descend to person-,43
NA,alities; and on the first occasion when I,43
NA,"contested the seat, he wrote a letter thank-",43
NA,"ing me for the honorable, clean way i n",43
NA,which I had conducted the election. Some,43
NA,"of my friends advised me to "" go "" for my",43
NA,"opponent, who, as a lawyer, could, they",43
NA,"said, easily be discredited; but this I de-",43
NA,"clined to do, as I knew he was an honor-",43
NA,able man. I knew I had a platform i n,43
NA,"which I believed, and i t is the same plat-",43
NA,form I stand by to-day. Where was the,43
NA,"necessity, then, to descend to personal",43
NA,abuse ? I n the coming election I shall con-,43
NA,"duct the fight in the same way, and I be-",43
NA,"lieve that I shall win i t , because the rank",43
NA,and file of the workers i n Denison know,43
NA,"me, and will give me their votes. On the",43
NA,question of conscription the Labour party,43
NA,had almost hourly meetings. We sat day,43
NA,"after day, and came to a decision at 2",43
NA,o'clock i n the morning. I there saw men,43
NA,"with tears i n their eyes who declared,",43
NA,""" Hughes, we will go down i o hell with",43
NA,"you."" B u t what did they do outside?",43
NA,What did one of those men do? D i d he,43
NA,stick to the Prime Minister? No. H e,43
NA,deserted. What did I do? While the,43
NA,Prime Minister was speaking at that meet-,43
NA,"ing, I wrote down what I intended to do,",43
NA,"and, after showing i t to the present",43
NA,"Leader of the Opposition, I burnt i t , be-",43
NA,cause there was no need to show i t to,43
NA,the Leader of the party. What I wrote,43
NA,down was that I should follow and stick,43
NA,"to him through thick and thin , and I",43
NA,think my resolve will win me the seat for,43
NA,"Denison. Even i f I were wrong, the",43
NA,people of Denison would stand by me for,43
NA,"being consistent and honest, regardless of",43
NA,pressure.,43
NA,When the Prime Minister came back,43
NA,"f r o m England, he gave a description",43
NA,"of what he had seen at the front, and",43
NA,told us what was likely to happen i n this,43
NA,country i f reinforcements. were not pro-,43
NA,vided. W h a t did we do in 1914?,43
NA,We went f r o m platform to platform and,43
NA,read the manifesto issued by Mr Fisher,43
NA,"at the instance of the Labour party, i n",43
NA,which i t was stated that Australia would,43
NA,stand by the Old Country i n this war to,43
NA,""" t h e last man and the last shilling.""",43
NA,Mr Hughes showed us the advantages,43
NA,that would be gained by sending rein-,43
NA,"forcements to the front, and I have since",43
NA,learned that the more men we have there,43
NA,the greater the number of lives that w i l l,43
NA,be saved. The honorable member f o r,43
NA,Capricornia stated last evening that at,43
NA,the time of the conscription referendum,43
NA,"men were not required at the front , and,",43
NA,"i n support of his contention, he stated",43
NA,"that no less than 50,000 Australians had",43
NA,been reviewed by the K i n g at Salisbury,43
NA,Plain. I do not know how many Aus-,43
NA,"tralians were reviewed there, nor do I",43
NA,think the honorable member knows. I,43
NA,doubt whether the Defence Department,43
NA,itself knows. Yet the honorable member,43
NA,for Capricornia stated that there were,43
NA,"50,000 Australians encamped on Salis-",44
NA,"bury Plain. Tf tbere were, they were",44
NA,there because they were not trained men.,44
NA,I t is idle to send undisciplined men,44
NA,front. They would be useless i n the,44
NA,"trenches, and their lives would be need-",44
NA,lessly sacrificed. B u t i f men were not,44
NA,required at the front-a s was urged by,44
NA,tlie honorable member f o r Capricornia-,44
NA,"why, i n heaven's name, have Australians",44
NA,been kept in the firing line since 1914-,44
NA,"meu whom we know personally, and who",44
NA,are longing to get back to their wives and,44
NA,children? Ask the Assistant Minister,44
NA,the nature of the letters he is continually,44
NA,"receiving, and he w i l l say that by every",44
NA,mail he gets communications f r o m wives,44
NA,and children asking that their husbands,44
NA,and fathers may be relieved f r o m duty.,44
NA,"""Why is this so? Because there are not",44
NA,the required men available to relieve,44
NA,them? I s that fair? I ask any unionist,44
NA,who believes i n forty-eight hours a week,44
NA,whether i t ia right to keep men eighty-,44
NA,eight hours weekly i n the trenches? Is,44
NA,i t right to keep them there nineteen days,44
NA,in succession? Only a few days ago I,44
NA,received a letter f r o m a relation of mine,44
NA,who is now i n the hospital with his toes,44
NA,almost dropping off as fche result of,44
NA,""" trench feet,"" due to his being kept too'",44
NA,long in the trenches. Y e t the honorable,44
NA,member f o r Capricornia says that there,44
NA,"were 50,000 Australians reviewed by the",44
NA,"K i n g on Salisbury Plain, and that men",44
NA,were not required at the front. I f he,44
NA,knr-ws that there were that number of,44
NA,Australians i n ' England at the time of,44
NA,"which lie spoke, he knows more than does",44
NA,the Minister for Defence.,44
NA,"Recognising these facts, what sort",44
NA,"of a man would I have been i f , pulsion.",44
NA,"to save my political skin, I",44
NA,-consented to obey those whom. I had,44
NA,"no right to obey? I f i t can be shown, by",44
NA,"reference to the Labour' platform, that I",44
NA,"was pledged to oppose conscription, I shall",44
NA,be thankful indeed. But conscription us i n i t .,44
NA,was not mentioned on the platform which,44
NA,"I signed three years ago, and in the",44
NA,festo which Mr Eisher issued at the,44
NA,"quest of the Labour party i n 1914,",44
NA,assured the Old Country that we were,44
NA,"with her to "" the last man and the last",44
NA,"shilling."" What did the Worker reLabour",44
NA,cently say? I t said that politicians,44
NA,being taught that their masters outside,44
NA,-meanin g the . Labour organizations-,44
NA,were going to take a more active part in,44
NA,politics. The present Prime Minister,44
NA,pointed out to us that men were,44
NA,"to the urgently wanted, and a number of",44
NA,us agreed to follow him. Why? Be-,44
NA,cause we believed that i t was necessary,44
NA,to secure the meu required to win this,44
NA,war and because we were i n honour,44
NA,bound to redeem our promise to the I m -,44
NA,perial Authorities. B u t we believed that,44
NA,as soon as the referendum had,44
NA,"been decided, even i f we were defeated,",44
NA,nothing more would be heard of the,44
NA,matter. We soon discovered that that,44
NA,was not so. I have been informed that,44
NA,"two members of our party, namely, the",44
NA,honorable member f o r Illawarra and,44
NA,"Senator Ferricks, actually attended a",44
NA,meeting i n New South Wales on the Sun-,44
NA,day preceding the memorable Caucus,44
NA,"meeting i n Melbourne, at which they were",44
NA,instructed to come down here and vote,44
NA,for the deposition of Mr Hughes f r o m,44
NA,the leadership of the party. I do not say,44
NA,"that the statement is correct, but i f i t is",44
NA,"not, let the honorable member f o r I l l a -",44
NA,warra refute i t . How can members of,44
NA,Parliament discharge their duties faith -,44
NA,f u l l y i f their attitude is to be dictated by,44
NA,an outside irresponsible body? I t has,44
NA,"been said that the Prime Minister, the",44
NA,"honorable member f o r Darling, and",44
NA,others were asked to explain their position,44
NA,"to that body, when, as a matter of fact,",44
NA,their fate had actually been decided i n,44
NA,advance? Was that just? I am very,44
NA,pleased that the honorable member f o r,44
NA,Brisbane has released me f r o m any obli-,44
NA,gation to observe secrecy by reading to-,44
NA,day a motion which was submitted i n,44
NA,"another place. Apparently, that motion",44
NA,applied only to Mr Hughes and to his ex-,44
NA,B u t what self-respecting body,44
NA,had of men would sit i n that meeting after,44
NA,such a resolution had been carried?,44
NA,NA,44
Mr LAIRD SMITH , I took the,44
NA,manimotion to mean that we were all to get,44
NA,"reout. I n support of my statement, I i n -",44
NA,he tend to quote from the Hobart Mercury,44
NA,"of Thursday, 16th November, 1916. Mr .",44
NA,"Lyons,' the president of the Political",44
NA,"League of Tasmania, upon being",44
NA,were interviewed by a representative of that,44
NA,journal when the Hughes Government,44
NA,"was formed, was asked, "" What about",44
NA,the position of Mr Jensen and Mr Laird,45
NA,"Smith in relation to the Labour party?""",45
NA,"To that Mr Lyons replied, "" They are",45
NA,in the same position as all other followers,45
NA,of Mr Hughes. They have cut them-,45
NA,"selves adrift, a^nd saved the organizations",45
NA,"the trouble of doing i t for them."" Surely",45
NA,that is definite enough. What could we,45
NA,do i n the circumstances ? I ask any,45
NA,unionist i u Australia i f I have ever been,45
NA,remiss i n the discharge of my duties?,45
NA,Yet I was not even given a hearing.,45
NA,"In tbe face of these facts, the honorable",45
NA,member for Kalgoorlie has the temerity,45
NA,to declare that members of the Official,45
NA,Labour party enjoy the same freedom to-,45
NA,day that they did previously.',45
NA,"were so, why is it that certain",45
NA,of that party are being so bitterly opposed,45
NA,in the ballot for selection? Had I been,45
NA,"a member of that party to-day, my selec-",45
NA,tion would have been contested.,45
NA,Because Denison is a fairlv easy Labour,45
NA,"seat now, which it was not when I cap-",45
NA,tured it. lt has been said that we would,45
NA,not have been here to-day but for the,45
NA,Labour'movement. But I would remind,45
NA,my honorable friends opposite that in,45
NA,"the time of Jimmy Hall, before the for-",45
NA,"mation of the Labour party, I was car-",45
NA,peted by the Tasmanian Railways,45
NA,missioners for taking an active part in,45
NA,politics. After that I had no intention,45
NA,of seeking election to Parliament;,45
NA,some time later I was approached,45
NA,"members of the Labour organizations,",45
NA,who assured me that they could not find,45
NA,"a man who could win the Denison seat,",45
NA,and who expressed the belief that I could,45
NA,secure it. I advised them to go to Mr.,45
NA,"L. L. Giblin, who is the Lecturer",45
NA,"Mathematics at the University,",45
NA,"him to become a candidate, as I thought",45
NA,he could win the seat. In a fortnight,45
NA,they came back to me and said that he,45
NA,"could not be induced to stand, and that,",45
NA,"consequently, I must contest it. I did",45
NA,"so, with the result that I am here to-",45
NA,day. I was also one of the framers of,45
NA,the Railways Superannuation Pund,45
NA,"Tasmania. It was formed, and I sub-",45
NA,"scribed to it, with the result",45
NA,at tlie age of sixty-five years,45
NA,would have been entitled to,45
NA,with a pension of about Â£2 a - week.,45
NA,"Thafc may not seem much,",45
NA,"represents Â£2,000, and there is not a man",45
NA,in the Labour party to-day who will,45
NA,have that amount at the age of sixty-five,45
NA,Jfr. Laird Smith.,45
NA,"years. I n addition, I was entitled to re-",45
NA,ceive a week's pay for every year that I,45
NA,had been i n the service. I have been,45
NA,twenty-one years there. I had to forfeit,45
NA,that pay when I consented to contest the,45
NA,Denison seat in this House. I did not,45
NA,"mind that, because the feeling which",45
NA,existed i n the constituency at the time,45
NA,made i t a pleasure to me to work for ifc.,45
NA,B u t what a difference there is over here !,45
NA,"Men call you "" brother,"" but they would",45
NA,stab you in the back i f they had an,45
NA,opportunity. Whab do I find here ? The,45
NA,secretaries of unions are continually be-,45
NA,ing opposed for their positions. A man,45
NA,will come from the other end of the,45
NA,"world. Nobody will know who he is, or",45
NA,If that what he is; bub he will criticise the work,45
NA,members of the holder of bhe office. Why? I n,45
NA,order that he may contest the position,45
NA,later on. I represented the Waterside,45
NA,Workers for six years i n the Federa-,45
NA,"Why? tion, and did my b i t side by side",45
NA,with the Prime Minister. When they,45
NA,"expelled me, they did i t i n the most",45
NA,kindly way by affirming that they were,45
NA,no longer going to have a member of Par-,45
NA,"liament to represent them, and each union",45
NA,thanked me for my past services. One of,45
NA,"these gentlemen, who became a union",45
NA,"secretary, jockeyed out of that position",45
NA,"Com- .a good man who had been there for years,",45
NA,and who was of a splendid type. A little,45
NA,later the union could not get an audit of,45
NA,"but its books, and when i t did get i t ,",45
NA,by i t was discovered that the organiza-,45
NA,tion had lost several hundreds of pounds.,45
NA,Where is that man to-day? I n gaol.,45
NA,Who put him i n gaol? The union. A n d,45
NA,he was one of these gentlemen who was,45
NA,going to show us how to ru n a union on,45
NA,in up-to-date lines. I t is not the rank and,45
NA,and ask file of the Labour party outside who are,45
NA,criticising me; i t is rabher the few who,45
NA,would like to have my seat. They say to,45
NA,"themselves, "" Denison is an easy seat to",45
NA,"win."" They think tbe same i n regard to",45
NA,Bass. I shall not allude to what the hon-,45
NA,orable member for Maranoa has said to-,45
NA,"day, because his remarks did not apply",45
NA,in to me.,45
NA,NA,45
NA,"I member putting up a dummy, only to",45
NA,retire knock i t down again ?,45
Mr LAIRD SMITH ,Becaus e I wish,45
NA,but it to acquaint the Committee with a few,45
NA,facts. I do not know what is in tbe,45
NA,"honorable member's mind, but I am stat-",45
NA,ing actual facts. We find to-day that,45
NA,one of the candidates for selection to run,45
NA,in the Labour interest for the represening,46
NA,tation of Tasmania i n the Senate is M,46
NA,"Woods, a prominent officer of the Politias",46
NA,cal Labour League; while Mr Ben,46
NA,"Watkins, another prominent member of",46
NA,"it, is seeking selection so that he can conto",46
NA,test my seat as the selected candidate of,46
NA,the Official Labour pary. Not one of,46
NA,these men who have criticised me so bitceived,46
NA,terly can say that I have departed from,46
NA,one plank of the Labour platform ; the,46
NA,only thing they could find against me,46
NA,that when the right honorable member,46
NA,for Parramatta addressed a meeting at,46
NA,Hobart i n connexion with thÂ© military,46
NA,"service referendum, I occupied a seat",46
NA,the platform.,46
NA,NA,46
NA,a seat.,46
Mr LAIRD SMITH , I recognise,46
NA,that. B u t a man who has done justice to,46
NA,his constituents is entitled to expect re-,46
NA,election - I have as much right to stand,46
NA,for the electorate of Denison as has any,46
NA,man.,46
NA,NA,46
Mr LAIRD SMITH , W h a t would be,46
NA,said of Justices of the H i g h Court who,46
NA,proceeded to adjudicate on cases involving,46
NA,business matters with which they,46
NA,directly concerned ? Yet that is what is Labour party what i t is to-day?,46
NA,being done by these league officials.,46
NA,I agree with tlie honorable member,46
NA,Maranoa that the Labour movement will,46
NA,"still go on. I t will continue to grow,",46
NA,cause i t will be cleaned up as a result,46
NA,"our action, and the rank and file of the ganization.",46
NA,party will arrive at a true appreciation,46
NA,of these officials who are after other men's,46
NA,seats. I f at every election we are to,46
NA,a change of representatives-on e man,46
NA,going out and another man going i n - I which,46
NA,question whether i t will be a good thing,46
NA,"for Australia. Where the secretary, the",46
NA,"treasurer, or the committee of a union",46
NA,"are doing honest service, we should",46
NA,"them i n ofiice. They are tried men,",46
NA,should not be replaced unless they retire,46
NA,or pass away. I invite honorable memBristol,46
NA,bers to consider for a moment the position,46
NA,"of the honorable member for Darling,",46
NA,"Mr Spence, who has been expelled",46
NA,from the Official Labour party.,46
NA,is beloved by every one; no man Labour,46
NA,would say an unkind word of him.,46
NA,"Some one said of him to-day, "" He is not",46
NA,"sad."" But have honorable members ever",46
NA,watched his face when he has been talk-,46
NA,to them of what he did for Labour i n,46
NA,r . the early days? Have they watched him,46
NA,he talked of his struggles in the early,46
NA,"days, when there was no payment of",46
NA,"union secretaries, and when he had almost",46
NA,starve i n the cause of unionism ? Is i t,46
NA,reasonable to believe that he does not feel,46
NA,"sad, i n view of the treatment he has re-",46
NA,at the hands of the Official Labour,46
NA,party's organizations. He must feel very,46
NA,"keenly the treatment meted out to him,",46
NA,was because he is still the same old Spence,46
NA,that he was when he first fought for,46
NA,unionism. H e has not departed one iota,46
NA,from the principles and opinions he held,46
NA,on when he first entered the Labour move-,46
NA,"ment. He is a fine old man, a king of",46
NA,"on humanity, a man of marked intelligence.",46
NA,One has only to hear him talk to,46
NA,recognise that. I understand that on,46
NA,"one occasion, he adjudicated i n a cer-",46
NA,tain case at Campbelltown. and began,46
NA,by putting all the members of the legal,46
NA,profession out of doors. He very speedily,46
NA,"fixed up an agreement, and one of the",46
NA,most conservative gentlemen i n the town,46
NA,declared that he had never listened to an,46
NA,abler or more intelligent man. A n d what,46
NA,has this outside Labour organization done,46
NA,to the honorable member f o r Darling-,46
NA,were this fine old man who has made the,46
NA,Even,46
NA,the most bitter opponents of the cause he,46
NA,for has so long espoused admire him. A n d,46
NA,yet this old gentleman has been cast out.,46
NA,beI n the days of his old age he has been,46
NA,of turned a d r i f t by the Official Labour or-,46
NA,I s that what we call bro-,46
NA,therly love? I s that the sort of Socialism,46
NA,for which we have been working? I s that,46
NA,have the sort of Socialism we want? Unhesi-,46
NA,"tatingly, I say i t is not. I t is something",46
NA,w i l l cast us a d r i f t i n our old age,46
NA,and leave us as paupers. Read the writ-,46
NA,ings and the - speeches of Socialists like,46
NA,"Thomas, the Erench Minister, and those",46
NA,keep of the many French and Belgian So-,46
NA,"and cialists of prominence, whose names I",46
NA,need not mention. These men went to tho,46
NA,Labour Conference with a peti-,46
NA,tion to the British working people to as-,46
NA,sist France and Belgium i n stemming,46
NA,"back the on-rushing tide of Huns, who",46
NA,He were laying waste their land. Not a,46
NA,man refused to listen to that peti-,46
NA,tion. A leading German Socialist told,46
NA,"me, i n Switzerland i n 1911, that i n 1914",46
NA,"Germany would have, f r o m a Socialistic",46
NA,"point of view, the most triumphant gene-",47
NA,ral election it had ever experienced. He,47
NA,"said, "" We have only to secure the",47
NA,agrarian vote-w e have only to win over,47
NA,the farmers-an d we shall sweep the polls.,47
NA,Then the Constitution of Germany will,47
NA,"have to be altered."" The German Em-",47
NA,"peror recognised this fact, and seeing, as",47
NA,"he believed, tin opportunity to conquer",47
NA,"other lands, he declared war, and set to",47
NA,work to crush the German Labour party.,47
NA,He has done so. He has crushed the So-,47
NA,cialists out of existence. Only one of,47
NA,"their leaders dared to stand against him,",47
NA,and that man to-day is in prison. So-,47
NA,"cialists from Belgium, Italy, and Erance",47
NA,"have visited Great Britain, with the ob-",47
NA,ject of urging workers to join with them,47
NA,in the fight to save their countries from,47
NA,the Huns.,47
NA,"In view of all these facts, how could speech.",47
NA,we on this side of the House do other-,47
NA,wise than we have done? Our,47
NA,desire was to save our country.,47
NA,because of that desire we are not to,47
NA,"spoken of as "" scabs"" and "" blacklegs.""",47
NA,Why should such abominable epithets,47
NA,be applied to men who have worked far,47
NA,into the night in the cause of Labour.,47
NA,one works harder than does a Labour,47
NA,ber while the House is in session. I have,47
NA,rushed from this House at 3 o'clock,47
NA,"on a Friday, caught the steamer for",47
NA,"Hobart. reached there, after a rough",47
NA,"sage, pn Saturday evening, addressed a",47
NA,"meeting the same night, returning home",47
NA,early on Sunday morning; addressed a,47
NA,meeting again on Sunday afternoon;,47
NA,"spent the whole of the next day in meetPorts,",47
NA,ing my constituents; addressed another,47
NA,"meeting on Monday night, and next day",47
NA,"have boarded the steamer once more, and",47
NA,have been in my place in this House,47
NA,on the Wednesday afternoon. Labour,47
NA,men iire almost worked to death. My,47
NA,wife has walked from house to house for,47
NA,"three months at a stretch, canvassing,",47
NA,"for me, but for another Labour candidate.",47
NA,And to-day we are practically driven,47
NA,pillar to post by a few outside Labour,47
NA,who would like to have the seat I occupy,47
NA,in Parliament. A few days ago,47
NA,peared in the Herald a statement of the,47
NA,business to be considered at the coming,47
NA,Labour Conference. We find that one,47
NA,branch of the league objects to universal,47
NA,"training, which has been invaluable to",47
NA,Afr. Laird Smith.,47
NA,Australia. Other branches say that the,47
NA,salaries of members should be pooled.,47
NA,"Members of Parliament, they say, should",47
NA,be paid a living wage. Who is to be the,47
NA,judge of what is a living wage ?,47
NA,NA,47
NA,"ries are to be pooled, the honorable mem-",47
NA,ber is just getting out in time.,47
Mr LAIRD SMITH , I do not intend,47
NA,to get out. The honorable member for,47
NA,"Maranoa, we are led to believe, is a rich",47
NA,man. I am not.,47
NA,NA,47
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ,,47
NA,( Mr ATKINSON) -Order ! The honor-,47
NA,able member's time has expired.,47
NA,HONORABLE MEMBERS -G o on.,47
Mr LAIRD SMITH ,(B y leave) - I,47
NA,"thank the honorable member for Bendigo,",47
NA,who has been good enough to give way,47
NA,"to me, in order that I may conclude my",47
NA,We have been told of the soli-,47
NA,"only darity of the Labour party, and it has",47
NA,Surely been said that the majority must rule.,47
NA,be Is there any understanding-i s there,47
NA,anything in our constitution to that,47
NA,effect? The honorable member for Kal-,47
NA,goorlie said that it .was laid down in our,47
NA,No constitution that the majority must rule;,47
NA,membut honorable memhers of the Official,47
NA,Labour party know that that is not so.,47
NA,We were free to vote as we pleased on,47
NA,any question outside the Labour plat-,47
NA,"pasform. By way of illustration, I propose",47
NA,to refer to something that occurred in the,47
NA,Official Labour Caucus when the question,47
NA,of conscription was under consideration.,47
NA,The honorable member for Melbourne,47
NA,"Mr Mathews, is involved in this,",47
NA,"and I regret that he is unable, owing to",47
NA,"other important public business, to be",47
NA,present this evening. I told him that I,47
NA,"intended to refer to this matter, so that",47
NA,I am not doing him any injustice. Be-,47
NA,fore the honorable member for Brisbane,47
NA,submitted his motion at the Caucus meet-,47
NA,not ing that the Prime Minister should be,47
NA,deposed from the leadership of the Labour,47
NA,"from party, the honorable member for Mel-",47
NA,"men, bourne Ports said, "" I am not in favour",47
NA,"of conscription, and I shall not be bound",47
NA,"there apby any vote of this party.""",47
NA,"Mr ""HANNAN -Hear , hear!",47
NA,NA,47
Mr LAIRD SMITH ,The n i f he was,47
NA,not to be bound by any vote of the party,47
NA,"on a question outside our platform, why",47
NA,"should the Prime Minister and myself,",48
NA,together with others who stand with u?,48
NA,"to-day, be blamed for refusing to be",48
NA,bound by the vote of the Official Labour,48
NA,party on a question outside the party,48
NA,"platform? ""What is f a i r i n the one case",48
NA,is surely f a i r i n the other.' I told the,48
NA,honorable member that I was going to,48
NA,"mention this fact, and he said, "" You are",48
NA,"quite correct."" He was consistent i n the",48
NA,"action he took. How, then, can wc be",48
NA,charged with inconsistency? Why should,48
NA,we be pushed out of the Labour move-,48
NA,"ment, which is as dear to us as i t is to",48
NA,every member of the Opposition. We de-,48
NA,"cline to be pushed out of i t , and we shall",48
NA,not be pushed out. I shall appeal to,48
NA,"those to whom I have appealed before,",48
NA,and I feel sure that they w i ll give me the,48
NA,consideration that I have always received,48
NA,at their hands.,48
NA,The honorable member for Illawarra,48
NA,"has just entered the chamber, and",48
NA,I should like him to say whether,48
NA,i t is not a fact that he would have,48
NA,had a sent i n this House sooner than he,48
NA,-did i f he had received justice at the hands,48
NA,of the few men who are now opposing me.,48
NA,Does he think that they gave h i m justice,48
NA,when he stood f o r Denison? Decidedly,48
NA,-not. Denison was to be kept f o r a cer-,48
NA,tain Labour man when i t was felt that i t,48
NA,could be won. Meantime the honorable,48
NA,member for Illawarra was put up fo r the,48
NA,constituency. A n d did these people help,48
NA,him ? D i d they go from house to house,48
NA,canvassing f o r him? D i d they put their,48
NA,hands in their pockets to assist him in his,48
NA,candidature? Wo; I can tell the Com-,48
NA,"mittee what they did when I went there,",48
NA,and they thought I had a chance of win-,48
NA,ning the seat. They put every obstacle,48
NA,"i n my way, and one of the leading mem-",48
NA,bers of the organization cleared out of,48
NA,the district fo r a fortnight before the,48
NA,polling day. The honorable member f o r,48
NA,Illawarra knows that this is true.,48
NA,opposition to-day is coming f r o m the,48
NA,"same old quarter. I t comes, not f r o m",48
NA,"the rank and file, who have always helped",48
NA,"a Labour candidate, taking the most ac-",48
NA,"tive interest in the contest, but f r o m men",48
NA,who dare not fight me openly. I t ema-,48
NA,nates from men who would come i n at the,48
NA,back door and deprive me of my seat.,48
NA,They were not prepared to contest the,48
NA,"Bass constituency, because they did not",48
NA,think i t could be won by a Labour man.,48
NA,The honorable member f o r Maranoa is,48
NA,"left unopposed again and again, because",48
NA,he represents a very large and difficult,48
NA,constituency to canvass. He is a good,48
NA,"fellow, big i n brain and big i n heart, and",48
NA,his constituency is also a big one. I t i3,48
NA,because of the difficulties i t presents to,48
NA,a candidate that he is not worried by,48
NA,"union officials, who would take i t f r o m",48
NA,him. He does not know what i t is to,48
NA,have a union man constantly watching,48
NA,"him, always finding fault with him, and",48
NA,telling him that he would be a much,48
NA,"better representative. One man, i t is",48
NA,"said, can do little. But one man can up-",48
NA,set a party; when he knows i t,48
NA,"is safe, he can criticise the Government",48
NA,"which he was returned to support, and can",48
NA,score off i t .,48
NA,NA,48
NA,man who broke up two parties.,48
Mr LAIRD SMITH , I do not think,48
NA,that is quite correct. I do not regret,48
NA,"having supported the Prime Minister, be-",48
NA,cause I believe he is honest in his convic-,48
NA,tions. Would he have made such a sacri-,48
NA,"fice if i t had been otherwise, and when",48
NA,letters were reaching him to the effect,48
NA,that his wife and child would be,48
NA,murdered ? Surely such communications,48
NA,as that would disconcert even the hon-,48
NA,orable member who has interjected. We,48
NA,"must admit, even i f we disagree with the",48
NA,"Prime Minister on certain matters, that",48
NA,he had nothing personally to gain by his,48
NA,"action; and let us, therefore, keep the per-",48
NA,sonal element out of this discussion.,48
Dr MALONEY , I think i t is only fair,48
NA,thafc the policeman's account of that i n -,48
NA,cident should be taken into consideration.,48
Mr LAIRD SMITH , I think the,48
NA,right honorable the Prime Minister was,48
NA,quite honest in his belief that i f we are,48
NA,to win the war we must have the men at,48
NA,"the front . We know that 8,000 men",48
NA,saved Paris; and I have learned from my,48
NA,"reading of American neutral journals,",48
NA,"My thafc of the 200,000 men who were rushed",48
NA,"to France i n the early stages of the war,",48
NA,"160,000 were either killed or wounded.",48
NA,Those are the men who saved not only,48
NA,"Great Britain , but the Empire, and with",48
NA,"the Empire, Australia. How long would",48
NA,"we be able to hold Australia, the most",48
NA,"progressive country in the world, i f the",48
NA,British Navy were annihilated ? Would,48
NA,"we not be ungrateful to England, there-",48
NA,"fore, i f we did not send the last man",48
NA,and the last shilling i n the true sense of,48
NA,"the word, to do a little f or the Mother",49
NA,Country which has done so much for us?,49
NA,"Away on the North Sea, British ships and",49
NA,ships of the Australian Navy are keeping,49
NA,watch. I t is because of this fact that,49
NA,"Australia, up t i l l very recently, has en-",49
NA,joyed an era of great prosperity. Thanks,49
NA,"to the British Navy, we have been able",49
NA,to sell and send our products to the people,49
NA,of the Mother Country. Surely then i t,49
NA,"is up to us, no matter what our politics",49
NA,"may be, and out of gratitude to those",49
NA,working men of our own class who are,49
NA,"risking their lives i n the North Sea, to do",49
NA,our best now to help them. We believed,49
NA,we could get the numbers here by the,49
NA,"means we adopted; but, because we were",49
NA,"honest, and attempted to do that, we are",49
NA,now to be crucified by our political op-,49
NA,ponents. Let us be honest about this,49
NA,"matter. The Prime Minister said, on",49
NA,behalf of this Government and those who,49
NA,"are supporting i t , that the people, hav-",49
NA,"ing decided the issue of conscription, that",49
NA,decision would be respected. I n the face,49
NA,"of this assurance, i t is cruel to say, as",49
NA,some men i n New South Wales are saying,49
NA,"to-day, that the conscription issue has",49
NA,been raised. Surely the people of Aus-,49
NA,tralia will not be misled by these tactics.,49
NA,I desire now to refer to a subjectmen-,49
NA,tioned by the honorable member for H u n-,49
NA,"ter, namely, the question of appointing",49
NA,a Commonwealth Supply and Tender,49
NA,Board. From my experience of the De-,49
NA,"fence Department, I am confident the ap-",49
NA,pointment of a Board as suggested would,49
NA,save thousands of pounds to the Common-,49
NA,wealth. Members of the Public Works,49
NA,Committee have done excellent work by,49
NA,pointing out the disadvantage of carrying,49
NA,so much stock i n certain classes of ma-,49
NA,"terial, for not only is store room unneces-",49
NA,"sarily occupied, but a large amount of",49
NA,capital is lying idle. The operation of a,49
NA,Supply and Tender Board would remedy,49
NA,"this state of affairs, and I hope, therefore,",49
NA,that i f the honorable member for Hunter,49
NA,returns to this House he will pursue the,49
NA,"subject; and i f I am here, I can promise",49
NA,him every assistance.,49
NA,Another matter of interest,49
NA,people of Tasmania is the,49
NA,to be placed on the importation,49
NA,"motor cars. In mv State, we have a",49
NA,"railway service right along the sea shore,",49
NA,and consequently the back country is,49
NA,"served by good roads and motor cars, with",49
NA,the result that settlers are able to obtain,49
NA,Mr Laird Smith.,49
NA,"their goods much more cheaply, and to",49
NA,reach the cities with greater ease than in,49
NA,former years. I f the proposed embargo,49
NA,on the introduction of motor cars is put,49
NA,"into operation, this traffic will be inter-",49
NA,"fered with considerably. Then, again,",49
NA,"we have a big tourist traffic, and a large",49
NA,number of people i n my constituency earn,49
NA,a living by catering for tourists. I have,49
NA,been told by travellers that there is no,49
NA,finer touring country in the world than,49
NA,Tasmania.,49
Mr FENTON , I t has been well adver-,49
NA,tised lately.,49
Mr LAIRD SMITH ,-Tha t is because,49
NA,the Railway Department spent about,49
NA,"Â£5,000 i n establishing tourist bureaux i n",49
NA,"Sydney and Melbourne, and in advertis-",49
NA,"i n g by other means, the advantages of",49
NA,Tasmania as a holiday resort. I know the,49
NA,honorable member wanted to draw me off,49
NA,"this subject by his interjection, but I do",49
NA,"not intend to go into that matter at all,",49
NA,as I know nothing about i t .,49
NA,The steamship service to Tasmania,49
NA,is another matter to which I i n -,49
NA,vite the attention of the Posmaster-',49
NA,General or the Treasurer. The com-,49
NA,panies do not issue return fares to,49
NA,"Tasmania, because under the system",49
NA,of single fares they can get more revenue,49
NA,"than they would obtain for return tickets,",49
NA,with the result that some people are disin-,49
NA,"clined to travel, as they are not sure when",49
NA,they will be able to get back. I have,49
NA,been approached by many i n my constitu-,49
NA,"ency, who feel the injustice of this prac-",49
NA,"tice, to bring the matter before the House,",49
NA,and I hope therefore that the responsible,49
NA,Minister will give this subject his careful,49
NA,attention without delay.,49
Mr HAMPSON ,Bendigo) [9.25] -,49
NA,The honorable member for Denison has,49
NA,referred to certain matters which i t was,49
NA,not my intention to deal with when I,49
NA,"came into the chamber, but after his",49
NA,"speech, I think they merit some recogni-",49
NA,tion from me as one who has been in the,49
NA,Labour movement for a great number of,49
NA,years. I have only joined two societies in,49
NA,to the my life-on e being the Australiau Natives,49
NA,"embargo Association, which I joined from patriotic",49
NA,"of motives, and as a friendly society; and the",49
NA,other is the Labour party. I t appeared,49
NA,to me that the honorable member for,49
NA,Denison was making rather an appeal to,49
NA,his constituents than attempting to inform,49
NA,members of this Chamber on the subjects,49
NA,he mentioned. He asks why he finds himber,50
NA,"self in his present company, and i n oppoapparently",50
NA,sition to those with whom he was returned,50
NA,to Parliament. He tells us that conscrip-,50
NA,tion as an issue was nofc i n the Labour,50
NA,"party's platform, to which h e ' and the",50
NA,gentlemen who left the Labour party were,50
NA,"pledged, and he asks what right has any",50
NA,outside body to say how he shall vote on,50
NA,that question. I t is one of those issues,50
NA,"which arise, I suppose, about",50
NA,"century, and i t might just as truly be said",50
NA,"that, because there is nothing on the",50
NA,"Labour platform with regard to slavery,",50
NA,the Labour movement -in Australia,50
NA,strongly opposed to that principle. What Echuca.,50
NA,was the issue upon which he was sent to,50
NA,represent his constituency ?,50
NA,turned with other representatives of the,50
NA,"Labour party, pledged to support the",50
NA,vernment during the time of the war.,50
Mr LAIRD SMITH , T o win the war.,50
Mr HAMPSON , Y o u were sent,50
NA,to assist the Government to conduct this,50
NA,war on a voluntary system of recruiting.,50
NA,NA,50
NA,"House, and that pledge was repeated by",50
NA,Mr Hughes when he became Prime M i,50
NA,ister. He declared that he was not going,50
NA,"to introduce conscription, and therefore",50
NA,you were pledged i n that way.,50
NA,voluntary system had not broken,50
NA,The facts are against you. The figures,50
NA,from your own Department are against,50
NA,"you, and yet you come and introduce a",50
NA,measure to try and force conscription,50
NA,the people. We entered this war with draw them.,50
NA,great ideals. We entered,50
NA,oppose German militarism; to repel,50
NA,the invaders of Belgium. We wanted,50
NA,"Belgium restored and indemnified, but",50
NA,we do not want i t to be done by you,50
NA,endeavouring to place the conscript sys-,50
NA,tem upon Australia-th e very system on,50
NA,which German militarism is based. There,50
NA,are the points at issue. Where you differ,50
NA,from vour stand when you were sent into drawn.,50
NA,the House is with regard to your pledge.,50
NA,"You ask what were you pledged to. Y o u of order, sir",50
NA,said in the pledge which you signed-,50
NA,I liorcby pledge myself not to oppose the,50
NA,candidate selected by the recognised political,50
NA,Labour organization.,50
NA,You pledged yourself to that.,50
Mr LAIRD SMITH ,Whe n I entered,50
NA,this Chamber?,50
Mr HAMPSON ,Yes .,50
NA,NA,50
NA,point of order is that the honorable,50
NA,is continually addressing his remarks,50
NA,"to me individually, and not to",50
NA,"the Committee, through tlie Chair.",50
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ,,50
NA,The honorable member will please address,50

Mr HAMPSON ,"Yes , sir. I f God",50
NA,had only given him as much brains as t'.e,50

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ,,50
NA,As the honorable member has taken ex-,50

Mr FOWLER ,"O n a point of order, sir,",50

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN , -,51
NA,I do not want to hear the honorable,51
NA,ber. I am quite prepared to give,51
NA,ruling. The honorable member,51
NA,Echuca regards an expression used by,51
NA,the honorable member for Bendigo as,51
NA,"offensive, and I ask him to withdraw i t .",51
Mr HAMPSON ,I f the honorable addressed in that way.,51
NA,member for Echuca regards the remark,51
NA,"as offensive, I will withdraw it. I",51
NA,not ask for a withdrawal of what he said,51
NA,"about me, but I will reply to",51
NA,derstood the honorable member to say,51
NA,that I endeavoured to drive my son to,51
NA,the war.,51
NA,NA,51
Mr HAMPSON ,Tha t statement is who support his ideas.,51
NA,"distinctly untrue, and now that you",51
NA,raised the question you might allow me,51
NA,to reply.,51
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN , -,51
NA,The honorable member must withdraw,51
NA,"the word ""untrue"" as applied to the",51
NA,statement of another honorable member.,51
Mr HAMPSON ,"Well , sir, the statemen",51
NA,ment is absolutely incorrect.,51
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN , -,51
NA,AVill the honorable member continue his,51
NA,speech ?,51
Mr HAMPSON , I may say that my trouble.,51
NA,son is in New Zealand and is married.,51
NA,When he was leaving here I told him,51
NA,that rather than be conquered I would,51
NA,prefer to be dead. I said that Germany,51
NA,would never conquer Australia i f all perthree-cornered,51
NA,sons were like myself.,51
NA,NA,51
NA,statement is in the letter?,51
Mr HAMPSON , I told my son that,51
NA,I would never use my vote to force a man now ?-,51
NA,to go to the war..,51
NA,NA,51
NA,letter.,51
Mr HAMPSON ,"Yes , it is.",51
NA,NA,51
Mr HAMPSON ,Neve r mind about,51
NA,reading the letter; the statement is there.,51
NA,"I have held that opinion all along, and",51
NA,"I have never shifted one point, while others",51
NA,did. I opposed conscription because I,51
NA,believe in keeping the civil law supreme.,51
NA,During all the ages there has been a con-,51
NA,test-wit h the military power at times,51
NA,and with the clerical power at other,51
NA,times. These conflicts have been in the,51
NA,interests of the people. I t has taken a,51
NA,long struggle to make the civil law,51
NA,supreme. I t is only in the last desperate,51
NA,resort that a nation should go for com-,51
NA,mempulsion. That was not the position in,51
NA,a Australia. You have never had an ex-,51
NA,for ample like it in the world.,51
NA,NA,51
NA,honorable member is continually address-,51
NA,"ing me as ""you."" I object to being",51
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN , -,51
NA,will The honorable member will address his,51
NA,remarks to the Chair and not to any hon-,51
NA,it. I unorable member individually.,51
Mr HAMPSON , I was not referring,51
NA,to the honorable member as an individual.,51
NA,"When I used the word "" you "" I meant",51
NA,those honorable members on the other side,51
NA,Through the,51
NA,have whole course of human history the,51
NA,"struggle has been to keep the civil law,",51
NA,which we have established in' this country,51
NA,on a better basis than has any other coun-,51
NA,"try I know of, supreme. Therefore, we",51
NA,oppose the idea of carrying military,51
NA,power and rule to the extent of taking,51
NA,"by the scruff of the neck, as i t is some-",51
NA,"times said, and running them into camp.",51
NA,I t was the attempt of the Prime Min-,51
NA,ister to try to introduce this new prin-,51
NA,ciple which led to the whole of the recent,51
NA,Here is what the honorable,51
NA,member for Denison said in this House,51
NA,only so late as the 14th September last-,51
NA,I believe that it has been said in my elec-,51
NA,"torate that I will be opposed, and that in a",51
NA,fight the Liberals will win.,51
NA,"There will be no three-cornered fight, because,",51
NA,I am not selected by the Labour party to,51
NA,"in the Labour interest, I will simply go",51
NA,back to my calling as a worker.,51
NA,Where is the Labour party selecting him,51
NA,"If, for example, the election is on a Satur-",51
NA,the day,51
NA,NA,51
NA,cerned about your own election. Leave,51
NA,his election alone.,51
Mr HAMPSON ,Th e next will be,51
NA,"the fifth election which I have fought, in",51
NA,five years. That is a better average than,51
NA,most members of the House have. I hear,51
NA,honorable gentlemen on the other side,51
NA,talk about the necessity to be unanimous,51
NA,"here, and to have only one party. I re-",51
NA,"member that, upon the death of Mr.",51
NA,"Arthur, i t was the Liberals who fought",51
NA,"the constituency I now represent, and",51
NA,did so with all their might. They,51
NA,did the same thing when the seat,51
NA,for the Grampians was vacant. Was,51
NA,anything said then i n regard to,52
NA,having unanimity here and one party?,52
NA,No. When the Liberals thought that,52
NA,tbey had an opportunity to grab any,52
NA,seat they contested i t . A t the present,52
NA,time they are pursuing the same course.,52
NA,"What, f o r instance, are they doing at",52
NA,Corio and at Ballarat? The Wiri-the-,52
NA,"War party, or the National Federation,",52
NA,which is the Liberal party under another,52
NA,"name, are going to contest the seats of the",52
NA,two honorable gentlemen who are doing,52
NA,their duty at the front . What is the,52
NA,sneer which we get f r o m the Prime M i n -,52
NA,ister? He says that neither of these two,52
NA,honorable members has been under shell,52
NA,fire.,52
NA,NA,52
Mr HAMPSON ,Yes . Y o u cheer,52
NA,the man you get f r o m the street and put,52
NA,"in khaki, and say that he is a great man,",52
NA,and is doing his duty to his country. B u t,52
NA,because you have two Labour politicians,52
NA,"in khaki, fro m Corio and Ballarat, the",52
NA,"Prime Minister sneers at them, and says",52
NA,that they have never been under fire.,52
NA,w i l l return now to the speech made by,52
NA,the honorable member for Denison i n,52
NA,September last. He continued-,52
NA,"I f , for example, the election is on a Saturday,",52
NA,"I shall, if I am not nominated, go back again",52
NA,on the Monday to work at my trade.,52
NA,Did he say the same thing to-night ? N o ;,52
NA,"he is going to contest the seat, and he w i l l",52
NA,get all those influences which opposed,52
NA,him at the last election to support him.,52
NA,He said-,52
NA,I f I am not selected to support Labour that,52
NA,is not my f a u l t; but I shall not come back,52
NA,here supporting anybody else.,52
NA,I can imagine the honorable member tell-,52
NA,ing the crowd at Hobart f r o m a platform,52
NA,a similar tale to that which he has been,52
NA,relating here to-night. B u t i t is idle,52
NA,for him to act i n that way. The disturb-,52
NA,ing influence i n the politics of Australia,52
NA,arose from the fact that our party,52
NA,selected a chairman who became Prime,52
NA,NA,52
NA,position to take the H i g h Commissioner-,52
NA,ship. The honorable member f o r West,52
NA,Sydney went to the country on the i m -,52
NA,portant and vital issue of conscription.,52
NA,No doubt he was thoroughly convinced,52
NA,that i t should be introduced.,52
NA,"Home, and came back, and I suppose he",52
NA,thought that he would introduce into,52
NA,Australia a measure similar to that which,52
NA,"his friend, Mr Lloyd George, introduced",52
NA,into Great B r i t a i n ; bufc he reckoned with-,52
NA,out the intelligence of the Australian pub-,52
NA,lic and the force of public opinion. H e,52
NA,"came back f r o m the referendum, after",52
NA,"slandering his own supporters, who had",52
NA,worked with hi m f o r twenty-five years,52
NA,in the Labour movement. I t is twenty-,52
NA,three years since I spoke f o r the right,52
NA,honorable gentleman when he first won a,52
NA,seat i n Sydney. Durin g the referendum,52
NA,campaign he used such vile language; he,52
NA,was so vituperative towards those who,52
NA,"had worked with hi m f o r years, that i t",52
NA,"created a feeling of bitterness, and the",52
NA,majority of the party felt that he was not,52
NA,fitted f o r the position of leader any,52
NA,longer.. When we met after the referen-,52
NA,"dum campaign, what broke the Labour",52
NA,party was this: A motion was moved,52
NA,for the deposition of the right honor-,52
NA,able gentleman f r o m the leadership.,52
NA,He knew that i f the motion were carried,52
NA,i t would depose him f r o m the position of,52
NA,Prime Minister at the same time. When,52
NA,I he would not submit to tbe w i l l,52
NA,of the majority of the party he,52
NA,"took up his papers, and asked those",52
NA,who agreed with h i m to walk out of,52
NA,the room. These men deserted the,52
NA,"party; they were not pushed out, and",52
NA,"what the Prime Minister has suffered,",52
NA,"and so on and so f o r t h , is the result of his",52
NA,own doings. H e was not prepared to,52
NA,submit to majority rule i n the party.,52
NA,He denied the right of the majority to,52
NA,depose him. He took out the Prime,52
NA,"Ministership i n his pocket, and those",52
NA,who followed him left the Labour party.,52
NA,A stop-gap Ministry was formed to carry,52
NA,on the Government. Mr Hughes saw,52
NA,"the Governor-General the same night,",52
NA,and the names .of the new team were,52
NA,published next morning. There was,52
NA,then thrown on the Liberal party the,52
NA,choice between deposing and following,52
NA,the Hughes party. For a few months they,52
NA,followed i t . Then came the invitation,52
NA,to attend the Imperial Conference. B u t,52
NA,because Mr Hughes felt that as things,52
NA,"stood he could not go Home i n safety, a",52
NA,Coalition was arranged. The Liberals,52
NA,"and the Hughesites, who deserted from",52
NA,"the Labour ranks, say that they are",52
NA,going to restore responsible government.,52
NA,He went,52
NA,Many Liberals are dissatisfied because of,52
NA,"the recent scandals, but Mr Hughes can-",52
NA,not be deposed while he holds the Prime,52
NA,"Ministership i n his pocket. I f he were,",53
NA,everything would go into the melting pot,53
NA,again. Therefore Australia is being,53
NA,"scoured to find a seat for this gentleman,",53
NA,who cannot face the constituents who,53
NA,elected him to this Parliament.,53
NA,NA,53
Mr HAMPSON , Let him come to,53
NA,Bendigo. I f the people of Bendigo do,53
NA,"not want me to represent them, let them",53
NA,say so.,53
Mr RODGERS ,Th e honorable member,53
NA,will be f u l ly occupied.,53
Mr HAMPSON , I have lost so many,53
NA,elections that I cannot count my defeats;,53
NA,"bub I have won four times i n succession,",53
NA,"and on three occasions my candidature,",53
NA,"instead of costing money, was profitable",53
NA,"to those, who supported me, because more",53
NA,was subscribed than had to be expended.,53
NA,"On the first occasion when I won, the",53
NA,election cost only Â£ 8 . Not many get a,53
NA,seat i n Parliament on those terms. I n -,53
NA,"deed, I hear that a large number cudgel",53
NA,their brains to find ways of bringing,53
NA,their election accounts within the legal,53
NA,"limitation, and actually spend more than",53
NA,the law permits. I did not rise to,53
NA,"to these matters, about which a good",53
NA,deal will be said during the electoral,53
NA,"campaign, bufc was prompted to do so by",53
NA,the remarks of the honorable member for,53
NA,Denison. Sometimes I feel like the hon-,53
NA,"orable member for Darwin, who said that",53
NA,he thought he had a constructive rather,53
NA,than a destructive brain. Having seen,53
NA,"so much i n my t r i p round the world, I",53
NA,feel thafc I ought to make public more,53
NA,information. The censorship tbat has,53
NA,been exercised i n this country seems to,53
NA,me to be absurd i n many respects.,53
NA,was pleased with a sub-leader i n to-day's,53
NA,"Argus, whicb showed that the more you",53
NA,take an educated Democracy into your,53
NA,confidence the better will be their re-,53
NA,"sponse. Of course, you must not make",53
NA,public information that will be of use to,53
NA,"your enemies, but i f you withhold infor-",53
NA,"mation that should be made public, you",53
NA,"create distrust and suspicion, and, i n -",53
NA,"stead of assisting, interfere with the con-",53
NA,duct of the war. I have never under-,53
NA,stood why the fact that i n the early part,53
NA,of the war we assisted New Zealand and,53
NA,South Africa should be hushed up. I t,53
NA,would have a good effect on our public,53
NA,to be told that we were able to produce,53
NA,".303 rifle cartridges, which could be made",53
NA,use of. I was surprised to see what was,53
NA,"being done i n England, Scotland, and",53
NA,Ireland i n the making of shells.,53
NA,"Ireland, even during the rebellion, shells",53
NA,were being turned out more cheaply than',53
NA,in Great Britain . A factory was built,53
NA,"in four weeks, and I saw there 700 per-",53
NA,"sons, who were fed on the premises. The",53
NA,machinery that was being used had been,53
NA,"commandeered from jewellers' shops,",53
NA,"technical schools, and all sorts of places.",53
NA,Women and girls were being paid two,53
NA,and three times as much as they had pre-,53
NA,"viously earned i n the linen mills, cotton",53
NA,"mills, and biscuit factories, and i n do-",53
NA,mestic service. What has occurred i n,53
NA,the Old Country is a triump h i n organi-,53
NA,zation. We pride ourselves on being,53
NA,"smarfc people, but we have utterly failed",53
NA,in this matter. There is an exhibition,53
NA,of Australian-made shell cases i n the,53
NA,"Queen's H a l l which, to the uninitiated,",53
NA,"may be striking, although actually i t",53
NA,shows the f u t i l i t y of whab we have done.,53
NA,"The Massey-Harris Company, i n Canada,",53
NA,"has a factory i n which men, not women",53
NA,"and girls, are employed, every man being",53
NA,"paid not less than Is. 4d., or 28 cents,",53
NA,per hour. The pay is higher than the,53
NA,"trade union rates, and bhe head man",53
NA,refer told me that there had nob been a strike,53
NA,"for twenty years. The factory is 1,000",53
NA,"miles from the seaboard, and makes shells",53
NA,"at a profit at a price of 6s., or l Â£ dol-",53
NA,lars each. I t commenced when the price,53
NA,was 13s. 6d. per shell-th e 18-lb. high,53
NA,explosive.,53
Mr MATHEWS ,The y would not give,53
NA,us a chance here.,53
Mr HAMPSON , W e failed utterly,53
NA,and abjectly. Millions of money have,53
NA,been poured into Canada i n payment for,53
NA,I munitions which she has produced. Aus-,53
NA,tralia has done well i n finding men-n o,53
NA,other Dominion has done better-an d i n,53
NA,raising money; but i n the production of,53
NA,shells we have p i t i f u l ly failed.,53
Mr MATHEWS , T h a t is the f a u l t of,53
NA,the British Government.,53
Mr HAMPSON , I t is not. I was,53
NA,interested i n this matter before leaving,53
NA,Australia. I took the trouble to go to,53
NA,Newcastle and see the Broken H i l l Steel,53
NA,Works. They were producing steel there,53
NA,which they offered to us for Â£ 1 0 10s. per,53
NA,ton. Our shells were turned down because,53
NA,of a microscopic hair-line flaw in the steel.,53
NA,"The manager of the works told me, i n",53
NA,"his Yankee way, "" I don't believe i t is a",53
NA,flaw at all. You can't make steel with-,53
NA,"out i t . "" We saw men in Sheffield",53
NA,chiselling out this flaw. Whilst that was,53
NA,In given as one of the great reasons why we,53
NA,"'did not produce shells i n Australia, the",54
NA,Government at the present time are send-,54
NA,ing this identical steel away to Great,54
NA,"Britain, with our artisans, to have i t made",54
NA,"into shells over there. Y o u, sir, as an",54
NA,Australian with patriotic blood tingling,54
NA,"in your veins, w i l l not tell me that that is",54
NA,a right policy to pursue. To send our,54
NA,raw material and our skilled workmen,54
NA,away f r o m the country at a time like this,54
NA,is a huge blunder.,54
NA,Mr BAJO?OBD -Wha t raw material are,54
NA,we sending away?,54
Mr HAMPSON ,Steel .,54
Mr BAMFORD ,No ; i t is being made,54
NA,into rails.,54
Mr HAMPSON , W e are sending,54
NA,"away some Bteel rails, I admit, but I am",54
NA,speaking of our lamentable failure to pro-,54
NA,duce shells. I talked this matter over,54
NA,"with the Minister for Defence. I made,",54
NA,inquiries of the Victorian Bailways Com-,54
NA,"missioners, and interviewed the Premier of",54
NA,this State on the subject before I went,54
NA,away to the Old Country. I endeavoured,54
NA,to induce the authorities to undertake the,54
NA,manufacture of shells at the Newport,54
NA,"Workshops, where there are thousands of",54
NA,skilled employees. I .wanted them to get,54
NA,into the shell manufacturing business at,54
NA,"the time the agitation arose. I found,",54
NA,"however, that their idea at that time was",54
NA,to turn out only 250 shells per week from,54
NA,a concern of that description.,54
NA,thought that i f they made gauges for,54
NA,private employers they would be doing,54
NA,their part i n the war. I t is no wonder,54
NA,- that we could not make any headway when,54
NA,people i n authority took such a pinhole,54
NA,view of the situation. The Massey-Harris,54
NA,"people are turning out shells i n millions,",54
NA,"- though they got into the business, as I",54
NA,"said, at 13s. 6d. per shell body, when we",54
NA,"were offered Â£ 1 Is. They put i n Â£60,000",54
NA,"worth of new machinery, and made a",54
NA,profit out of their first order sufficient to,54
NA,pay for the whole of the machinery. Now,54
NA,"they run a hospital i n London, give thou-",54
NA,"sands of pounds to patriotic funds, and",54
NA,have got their price for shells down to,54
NA,"1$ dollars, or 6s., and are still making a",54
NA,profit. The organization of their scien-,54
NA,tific and technical work has been such,54
NA,"that, while wages have risen, the cost of",54
NA,production has gone down.,54
NA,their steel a little cheaper than we could,54
NA,".get i t - They pay about Â£ 8 per ton,",54
NA,whilst the steel here costs Â£ 1 0 10s. per,54
NA,ton; but the increased cost here should,54
NA,not have been any bar to our successful,54
NA,[401],54
NA,production of shells. They are paying,54
NA,higher prices i n England.,54
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ,,54

Dr MALONEY ,I bhink we should have,54
NA,a quorum. [Quorum formed.'],54
Mr RODGERS ,Wannon) [10.0] -,54
NA,The Treasurer has placed before the -,54
NA,Committee and the country a very,54
NA,candid statement of thc finances of,54
NA,"the Commonwealth. I t is right that,",54
NA,at this stage i n the prosecution of.,54
NA,"the war, Australia should stand four-",54
NA,"square to her responsibilities, and her",54
NA,financial responsibility is by no means a,54
NA,light one. The Treasurer has been very,54
NA,"candid, and his statement is f u l l . He has",54
NA,"shown us that, with our ordinary obliga-",54
NA,"-tions for services, plus the expenditure",54
NA,"f o r the prosecution of. the war, we must,",54
NA,"i n addition to ordinary revenue, find each",54
NA,"year a sum ' of Â£6,800,000 as interest",54
NA,"on the loans, &c. That is reckoning our",54
NA,war indebtedness at. the figure at which,54
NA,i i stands to-day. We know that that debt,54
NA,"is going to accumulate, and consequently",54
NA,"the Treasurer's estimate of Â£6,800,000",54
NA,additional revenue required will be vastly,54
NA,increased; and the people of this country,54
NA,should be prepared f o r the increased taxa-,54
NA,tion which must follow. I wish to deal,54
NA,very briefly with recent deyelopments in,54
NA,the political life of this country. I do,54
NA,They not propose to trace the history of all the,54
NA,"happenings since the declaration of war,",54
NA,except to say that there was a period dur-,54
NA,ing which I think the whole of the citi-,54
NA,zens of Australia had but one object in,54
NA,"view, ' and thafc was to stand to their",54
NA,obligations to prosecute the war with the,54
NA,utmost effort of which the nation was,54
NA,"capable. Unfortunately, that condition",54
NA,of affairs does not exist to-day. Whether,54
NA,the decision to consult the people as to,54
NA,the methods to be adoptedby which we,54
NA,should w i n the war was right or wrong-,54
NA,and i t is too late now to hold a post-,54
NA,mortem upon i t - i t is sufficient to say,54
NA,that the taking of the referendum divided,54
NA,the people of Australia into two great,54
NA,hostile camps. That is greatly to be re-,54
NA,gretted. The attitude of the party to which,54
NA,"I belong, since i t appealed to the people",54
NA,for authority at the last election to con-,54
NA,"They get duct the war, and since that authority",54
NA,"being given to our opponents i n politics,",54
NA,has been to follow the Government in every,54
NA,measure they believed to be necessary for,54
NA,the prosecution of the war. For over two,54
NA,years the Liberal party has been the,54
NA,"shadow following the figure, at first, while",55
NA,Mr Fisher was Leader of the Labour,55
NA,"party, subsequently when he was succeeded",55
NA,"by Mr Hughes, and to-day when Mr.",55
NA,Hughes leads the present combined party.,55
NA,"Our attitude, and the forces behind us,",55
NA,have been consistent in this regard,55
NA,"throughout. But, unfortunately for the",55
NA,"country, there has heen a family quarrel",55
NA,amongst those opposed to us in politics.,55
NA,That family quarrel has placed Australia,55
NA,in Buch a position that we are not now,55
NA,prosecuting thc war with the same unani-,55
NA,mity and vigour as we did before.,55
Dr MALONEY ,I draw attention to,55
NA,the state of the House. [Quorum formed.],55
Mr RODGERS ,A s a result of this,55
NA,unfortunate cleavage we have to-day the,55
NA,"Official Labour party, the Hughes party,",55
NA,and the Liberal party; and the Liberal,55
NA,party and the Hughes party have co-,55
NA,alesced for the purpose of prosecuting,55
NA,"the war. There has been no fusion, and",55
NA,no attempt at fusion. Wo have not at-,55
NA,tempted to put our two platforms to-,55
NA,gether and come to a common agreement.,55
NA,I have no authority to bargain away the,55
NA,principles that brought me into this,55
NA,"House, and I have no intention of doing",55
NA,that. The only reason why I have voted,55
NA,for the present arrangement is because,55
NA,I believe that of the members of the old,55
NA,Australian Labour party the keenest and,55
NA,most earnest in the prosecution of the war,55
NA,"are to be found on this side of the House,",55
NA,and because i t little matters who may be,55
NA,the individual placed in charge of the pro-,55
NA,"secution of the war, so long as he has",55
NA,been elected to his position by the,55
NA,"country, and is sincere and patriotic",55
NA,in the performance of his duties.,55
NA,Liberal party and the forces in the coun-,55
NA,try behind it are prepared to put aside,55
NA,their individual and political ideals for,55
NA,"the timo being, until we get the great",55
NA,struggle over. I t will then be time,55
NA,"enough to see where we stand, so far as",55
NA,domestic politics are concerned. I was,55
NA,"one of those who, when the recent nego-",55
NA,"tiations were under consideration, both",55
NA,voted and worked earnestly for a National,55
NA,Government of the three parties.,55
Mr BURNS ,Becaus e you wished to,55
NA,kill them.,55
Mr RODGERS ,Kil l whom?,55
Mr BURNS ,Th e National party.,55
Mr RODGERS ,No w that the honor-,55
NA,"able member has made that intersection,",55
NA,I may say that the object we had in view,55
NA,was the patching up of this family quar-,55
NA,"rel, and the Leader of the Official Labour",55
NA,party and the party itself must accept the,55
NA,responsibility for its continuance by de-,55
NA,clining to take their share in the .task im-,55
NA,posed upon us along with our comrades,55
NA,and relatives who are in the trenches to-,55
NA,day. I t is all very well for honorable,55
NA,"members to say, "" We could not work",55
NA,with Hughes or the Leader of the Liberal,55
NA,"party."" Their friends and their rela-",55
NA,tives in the trenches are fighting side by,55
NA,side with our relatives. A l l are members,55
NA,of the great Anzac party. They are,55
NA,sinking their private differences as to,55
NA,political matters which' they held before,55
NA,they left these shores. They are facing,55
NA,the same odds and sharing the same dan-,55
NA,gers. I t is lamentable that here we are,55
NA,rent asunder while our fellows are fight-,55
NA,ing together side by side for us and their,55
NA,country.,55
Mr MATHEWS ,W e are fighting for,55
NA,them here.,55
Mr RODGERS ,Notwithstandin g all,55
NA,"the bitterness that has taken place, all",55
NA,"the _ vile attacks upon, and the vendetta",55
NA,"against, the Prime Minister, and certain",55
NA,-members of his party who have followed,55
NA,"him, I still think that even yet i t is pos-",55
NA,sible for Australia to square up and face,55
NA,her obligations as one united country.,55
NA,"Therefore, I say it is unfortunate that",55
NA,once again the Commonwealth is to be,55
NA,lashed into one of those turmoils such as,55
NA,we experienced during the recent referen-,55
NA,dum campaign. Even now attempts are,55
NA,heing made by the Tudor party to,55
NA,resurrect the old cry of ' conscrip-,55
NA,tion. I do not know how far i t is,55
NA,"going to help my friends opposite, but if",55
NA,there is anything in tho democratic prin-,55
NA,"The ciple of the majority having its way, we",55
NA,should respect the view of the people once,55
NA,"it has been given, or wipe out the pro-",55
NA,vision in our Constitution that provides,55
NA,for the holding of a referendum. The,55
NA,military service referendum was taken in,55
NA,"the constitutional way, and, though",55
NA,"I bitterly regret the result . of it,",55
NA,we are bound to accept the verdict,55
NA,of the people; otherwise I do not,55
NA,know how we could carry on the go-,55
NA,vernment of the country. Last night I,55
NA,listened to a very interesting speech,55
NA,from the honorable member for Bourke.,55
NA,I t was a truly 'characteristic speech from,55
NA,the honorable member. He understands,55
NA,the art of politics as well as any bonor-,55
NA,"able member opposite; in fact, he has",55
NA,now no equal over there. On the eve of,55
NA,"an election, he knows how best to ' rig",55
NA,political platforms. Ho knows the value,56
NA,of a'placard. His object last night waa,56
NA,as patent as could be. He did not care,56
NA,anything about conscription for the time,56
NA,being. Some one else could play with,56
NA,that. He gave the lead to his party. He,56
NA,"said, "" Never mind the Watson business.",56
NA,There in detail stands the statement of,56
NA,"Senator Watson, and there in .detail,",56
NA,stands the statement of the Prime Min-,56
NA,"istor."" When the first statement was",56
NA,made in this chamber by the honorable,56
NA,"member for Melbourne Ports, and in an-",56
NA,"other place by an honorable senator, .1",56
NA,came here on the following morning for,56
NA,the purpose of casting a vote in a certain,56
NA,direction. I did not know thab the Sena-,56
NA,"tor Watson business was to come on,",56
NA,"snd I asked a question whether, in",56
NA,"view of the alarming statements made,",56
NA,the Prime Minister proposed to refute,56
NA,them. Not for all the tea in China would,56
NA,I have cast a vote to extend the life of,56
NA,Parliament had not the Prime Minister,56
NA,emphatically deniod the statements that,56
NA,"had been made. He has done so, and",56
NA,I accept his word against those who,56
NA,made statements against him. I n tho,56
NA,"same way, the honorable member for",56
NA,Bourke last night placed no reliance on,56
NA,Senator Watson's statement. He knew,56
NA,very well that the people would see the,56
NA,"Prime Minister's statement in rebuttal,",56
NA,that the statements of the President,56
NA,of the Senate and of Senator Pearce,56
NA,"would also be on record, and thab the",56
NA,people were likely to believe the state-,56
NA,ments of the three against that of Sena-,56
NA,"tor Watson; and so he went "" n a p "" on",56
NA,ex-Senator Ready. He made no charge in,56
NA,"reference to this matter. I n fact, no",56
NA,charge has yeb been made in connexion,56
NA,with ex-Senator Ready. He simply talked,56
NA,of the fact that this gentleman had been,56
NA,spirited out of public life. Very well.,56
NA,1 have a proposition to make. Ex-Senator,56
NA,Ready is still a member of the Political,56
NA,Labour party; he is still a member,56
NA,of the Official Labour party; he has not,56
NA,resigned and ho has not been cast out.,56
NA,"Why, then, do not honorable members",56
NA,arraign him ? Why do they not call him,56
NA,before his political masters as the honor-,56
NA,"able member for Maribyrnong, who only",56
NA,went a step or two outside the Caucus,56
NA,"room, was called to account by his politi-",56
NA,cal masters 1 Why do they not call ex-Sena-,56
NA,tor Ready before them and havo on in-,56
NA,vestigation f They make the charge con-,56
NA,"cerning him, and, therefore, the responsi-",56
NA,bilitv is on their heads. They have the,56
NA,machinery for dealing witb him. He is,56
NA,"still a member of their party, and has not",56
NA,resigned.,56
Mr MATHEWS ,H e has gone.,56
Mr RODGERS ,The y can call him,56
NA,to account. Why do they not do so?,56
NA,They tell the country that this man has,56
NA,"betrayed them and their party, yet they",56
NA,decline to lay any charge against him in,56
NA,their own movement. Why ? Because,56
NA,they wish to keep the thing dangling,56
NA,over people's heads by means of insinua-,56
NA,"tion, innuendo, and suspicion. I t will",56
NA,give them a new placard for tho elections.,56
NA,"The great Australian Labour party, as",56
NA,"they call themselves, have an obligation",56
NA,"to this country, because they have charged",56
NA,"one of 'their men with corruption, and,",56
NA,"after all, he is a comrade of theirs, and",56
NA,fought with them in tho political,56
NA,trenches. The responsibility of substan-,56
NA,"tiating that charge is theirs, although",56
NA,they claim that he has left them and gone,56
NA,over to the enemy. I propose to pass,56
NA,"over that business, but i t is a sorry spec-",56
NA,tacle to see this young nation in its pre-,56
NA,sent internal condition while a life and,56
NA,death struggle is going on. iu the other,56
NA,part of tho world. Ib is not credtable,56
NA,to Australia. We have stood high in the,56
NA,eyes of the world. The achievements of,56
NA,our battalions in their great contests,56
NA,have put this country on a high pinnacle.,56
NA,"When, in this young Democracy, 300,000",56
NA,"men jumped to arms of their own accord,",56
NA,thoy put on record one of the finest per-,56
NA,"formances possible for a young nation, but",56
NA,other countries will judge us by the way,56
NA,we are acting while thoso men are fight-,56
NA,"ing, and a sorry spectacle we cut. The",56
NA,coudition of war has necessitated many,56
NA,important changes in the conduct and,56
NA,management of our internal business. I,56
NA,"have always, in times of peace, been a",56
NA,"keen believer in the individualistic idea,",56
NA,"but, in times of war, all must stand by",56
NA,"the nation. I t should be "" all in,"" and",56
NA,1 would have gono further than most of,56
NA,thc people who put the proposal for a,56
NA,special referendum. I cannot believe that,56
NA,"it, is right and fair that on a particular",56
NA,band of people who happen to fall be-,56
NA,"tween certain ages, and on their relatives,",56
NA,should fall the responsibility for the,56
NA,safety of the country in war time. I f in,56
NA,times of peace individuals have the fullest,56
NA,"freedom to enrich themselves they should,",56
NA,"in times of wax, give their brains, services,",56
NA,"ability, and all their resources to their",56
NA,country. I believe i n the fulle r measure,57
NA,of national servioe that Mr Lloyd George,57
NA,"has imposed on the Old Country, i n the",57
NA,re-arrangement of our internal affairs,57
NA,"that I spoke of, wo have had to bring into",57
NA,existence the grouping or pooling system.,57
NA,We have had to create a pool i n con-,57
NA,nexion with nearly all our big primary,57
NA,"industries, and the people have not ob-",57
NA,jected. Individual growers. of wool,57
NA,and wheat and producers of metals and,57
NA,other articles have not objected to the fact,57
NA,that freedom to make their own indi-,57
NA,vidual bargains has been taken f r o m,57
NA,"them. I n the main, I approve of tbe prin-",57
NA,ciple as a war necessity. The conduct,57
NA,of the Wheat Pool has been a very,57
NA,"big matter, considering that",57
NA,"machinery hac4 to: be, improvised",57
NA,and the Pool brought into existence,57
NA,without much time to spare.,57
NA,irregularities have occurred i n some,57
NA,"matters, and i n regard to them, dif-",57
NA,"ferences of opinion may have arisen, but I",57
NA,rather regret to have to call attention to,57
NA,"the fact that, whereas the managers of",57
NA,thc Pool became trustees f o r the indi-,57
NA,"viduals who place their wheat i n i t , they",57
NA,"have, i n some cases, allowed themselves to",57
NA,be burned into a debt-collecting agency.,57
NA,Scrip which should have gone to the,57
NA,grower of wheat has been handed over by,57
NA,"them to the State Governments, even",57
NA,-vhen those State Governments held no,57
NA,lien over i t .,57
Mr CORSER ,Som e State Governments,57
NA,demanded i t .,57
Mr RODGERS ,B y so doing the,57
NA,State Government commits a breach of,57
NA,trust. The wheat is put i n the Pool by,57
NA,the farmer on terms specified by Act of,57
NA,"Parliament i n this Chamber, but the",57
NA,managers of the Pool arrange w i t h the,57
NA,"States' i n some cases, instead of sending",57
NA,on the certificate as directed by the indi-,57
NA,"vidual grower, to hand i t over to the State",57
NA,"Government, so that the Government may",57
NA,hold a lien over i t f o r the payment of,57
NA,tain obligations. There aro many young,57
NA,settlements i n this country where the,57
NA,"farmers are beginners, who have had a",57
NA,"terrible struggle to get through, unlike",57
NA,old districts with plenty of cash reserves,57
NA,backed up by many years of settlement.,57
NA,"They desired to arrange their finances,",57
NA,and when their scrip is sent to other,57
NA,hands dislocation of their affairs takes,57
NA,place. I can give a specific case. A,57
NA,young farmer had 900 odd bushels of,57
NA,wheat in the Pool. He made an arrange-,57
NA,ment with the bank to anticipate the ar-,57
NA,rival of the scrip to pay his obligations,57
NA,"and commitments, for whichhe had the",57
NA,money he expected to receive all parcelled,57
NA,out. H e had made particular arrange-,57
NA,ments with the State Government with re-,57
NA,spect ito.certain moneys owing to them.,57
NA,"Notwithstanding all this, the scrip did not",57
NA,"arrive at his bank, but was handed over",57
NA,"to the State Government, and all his pri-",57
NA,vate arrangements were upset. This,57
NA,struggling farmer had to pay l i s . 6d. for,57
NA,second-hand cornsacks and 2s. dockage,57
NA,"for using second-hand bags, so that",57
NA,he was landed for 13s. 6d. That ie not,57
NA,the way to help struggling farmers over,57
NA,their difficulties. I was to-day a member,57
NA,the of a deputation which waited on the Trea-,57
NA,surer to endeavour to get the Government,57
NA,at this important time to guarantee a,57
NA,Slight minimum price fo r the Bcrip representing,57
NA,the production of the last two years. We,57
NA,pointed out that a system had sprung up,57
NA,of speculators endeavouring to buy the,57
NA,scrip. The firms who ordinarily deal in,57
NA,wheat are forbidden to operate in the,57
NA,scrip. The millers have to buy from the,57
NA,"Pool, and cannot rightly bargain i n the",57
NA,scrip. The big shipping agents are agents,57
NA,and confidential advisers for the Govern-,57
NA,"ment, and therefore cannot rightly buy i t .",57
NA,There is therefore no money i n the ordi-,57
NA,"nary sense in the trade to buy scrip, but",57
NA,many speculators have taken advantage of,57
NA,the fact that the farmers have no know-,57
NA,ledge of the prospective value of their,57
NA,"scrip, and have bought i t as low as 7d.,",57
NA,"before the last 6d. advance was made,",57
NA,although Is. has still to be paid on i t .,57
NA,We hope the Treasurer will see his way,57
NA,"to fix a definite price, as has been done",57
NA,in Great Britain . That will be a stimulus,57
NA,"to increase the area, and where the ex-",57
NA,"penses haye mounted up for cornsacks,",57
NA,"and so forth, i t will give the farmer an",57
NA,absolute guarantee as to the return. I,57
NA,do not say that the farmer should have,57
NA,any such guarantee before he puts in his,57
NA,"cer- crop, but i n the wider interests of the",57
NA,State itself i t is important to follow the,57
NA,policy adopted i n the Mother Country.,57
NA,The Wool Pool is another important ar-,57
NA,"rangement, which will handle Â£30.000,000",57
NA,"worth of money. I t is, of course, impos-",57
NA,sible for every man to be paid at the same,57
NA,"time, but some have been paid, and others",57
NA,are not likely to get their money until,57
NA,"May, or, perhaps, June.",57
Mr LIVINGSTON ,D o they not pay,57
NA,fourteen.days after appraisement?,57
Mr RODGERS ,Unfortunatel y i n,58
NA,some cases the appraisements will not be,58
NA,made until May or June.,58
NA,Dr MAI.ONES -I draw attention to the,58
NA,fact that there is not a quorum,58
NA,[Quorum /armed.],58
Mr RODGERS ,I n order to obviate,58
NA,the inequality of treatment to the various,58
NA,"wool-growers, I advocated at an early",58
NA,stage that out of the special equalization,58
NA,fund that has been created some provi-,58
NA,sion might be made f o r the payment of,58
NA,interest to those whose clips are not ap-,58
NA,"praised until May or June, or late i",58
NA,season. There is another f u n d that,58
NA,into the Wool Pool by which this might,58
NA,be done. I refer to the appraisement,58
NA,"skins; and to the provision that, i f",58
NA,"realize in the Old Country more than the Â£7,500.",58
NA,"appraised price here, the surplus does",58
NA,"not go to the grower of the skins, but into",58
NA,the Wool Pool. That f u n d might very,58
NA,rightly be ear-marked to pay the interest,58
NA,in the way I suggest. I now wish to refer,58
NA,"to the question of repatriation, and i",58
NA,one on which I am not i n f u l l agreement,58
NA,with the Treasurer or the Government.,58
NA,"I have, as much as any man i n the counduct",58
NA,"try, contended that a scheme of repatriamean",58
NA,tion should have been taken i n hand,58
NA,"fore now. There are already 25,000 retion,",58
NA,turned soldiers i n this country; and,58
NA,"doubt a lot of work has been done, an-,",58
NA,many men dealt with. Splendid,58
NA,"has been done by private individuals, who",58
NA,gave freely of their time and abilitv:,58
NA,that is not sufficient. A l l the,58
NA,allotted up to date f o r repatriation,58
NA,"Â£321,000.",58
Mr MATHEWS ," N o , n o ; there has",58
NA,"been spent only Â£21,000.",58
Mr RODGERS ,"Th e sum of Â£325,000",58
NA,has been placed at the disposal of the,58
NA,authorities.,58
Mr MATHEWS ,"Yes , b u t not spent-",58
Mr RODGERS ,Th e sum of Â£325.000,58
NA,has been placed at the disposal of the,58
NA,"trustees. I f that be spread over 25,000",58
NA,"men, i t means Â£ 1 3 a head; while i f i",58
NA,"spread over two-thirds, i t means Â£ 2 0 a",58
NA,"head ; and over half of them, Â£ 2 6 a head.",58
NA,"That is amelioration, not repatriation.",58
NA,I f we give a man a few pounds i n this party,58
NA,"way, he will simply nurse his wounds",58
NA,and curse the country. These men ought gentleman.,58
NA,to be absorbed i n our industrial life.,58
NA,know that Senator Millen is taking the,58
NA,"matter i n hand, and will grapple with i t",58
NA,"I f we allow this matter to d r i f t , we shall",58
NA,"be blameworthy, f o r , unless they are",58
NA,"looked after, the men will simply swell",58
NA,the ranks of the unemployed. Although,58
NA,"the War Councils w i l l not be suspended,",58
NA,Parliament is likely to be out of session,58
NA,for at least two months; and we ought to,58
NA,clearly realize the difference there is be-,58
NA,present. tween relieving and absorbing our re-,58
NA,turned soldiers.,58
Mr MATHEWS ,Melbourne Ports),58
NA,[10.32] -M y reading of the Treasurer's,58
NA,statement is altogether different from that,58
NA,of the honorable member f o r Wannon.,58
NA,"' I n that statement, on page 6, we are",58
NA,told tliat the expenditure i n connexion,58
NA,n the with repatriation to 31st January of,58
NA,"falls this year has been Â£21,000, leaving a",58
NA,"balance of Â£304,000. Then we are tur-",58
NA,of ther told that the administration of the,58
NA,skins Soldiers' Repatriation Fund has cost,58
NA,There has been an enormous,58
NA,amount of work done voluntarily; and,58
NA,"yet, f o r an expenditure of Â£21,000, we",58
NA,"find an administrative cost of Â£7,500'.",58
NA,We promised our soldiers that they would,58
NA,be looked after when they returned; and,58
NA,t is I am certain we all know of hundreds oi,58
NA,deserving cases. I have not a word to,58
NA,say against the officials who have the con-,58
NA,"of this work. They have a big job,",58
NA,"well, and have done much; but I",58
NA,becannot agree that the cost of administra-,58
NA,i n view of the amount of expendi-,58
NA,"no ture, i9 a fai r one. I cannot conceive",58
NA,where the honorable member for Wannon,58
NA,work gets an expenditure of over Â£300 000.,58
NA,"I marvel at the fact that, up t i l l the pre-",58
NA,"bu t sent time, they have expended only",58
NA,"money Â£21,000 in this direction. I know two",58
NA,is blind men who are waiting to be placed,58
NA,on a piece of ground with a house apiece.,58
NA,I know a dozen returned soldiers who have,58
NA,lost the opportunity to acquire businesses,58
NA,because they could not get the money with,58
NA,which to purchase them. Repatriation is,58
NA,one of those things which the Win-the-War,58
NA,partv will have to look to better than i t,58
NA,has been doing. During this debate there,58
NA,"has been"" a iSt of abuse indulged i n by",58
NA,honorable members on both sides of the,58
NA,"t be chamber,, and a good deal has been said",58
NA,about tlie personal hate of the Prime M i n -,58
NA,ister by members of tlie Australian Labour,58
NA,party. B u t the fact is that amongst that,58
NA,I have heard very little personal i l l -,58
NA,will expressed towards the right honorable,58
NA,We do say that he has,58
NA,I wrecked our movement f o r his own per-,58
NA,"sonal aggrandizement, and f o r the pur-",58
NA,. pose of elevating himself above all others.,58
NA,"Officially, we are justified i n entertaining",58
NA,strong feelings against him on that ac-,58
NA,count. H e asked those who agreed with,58
NA,him to follow him out of the memorable,58
NA,"Caucus meeting, and they did so. Had",59
NA,"he alone left the room, there would have",59
NA,been no disruption of the party.,59
NA,right honorable gentleman never loses an,59
NA,"opportunity, either here or elsewhere, of",59
NA,traducing members of the party on this,59
NA,"side of tlie chamber, as well as the organithe",59
NA,zations outside. I could understand such,59
NA,abuse coming from the honorable member,59
NA,"for Plinders, or the right honorable mem-",59
NA,"ber for Swan, who for ten years have",59
NA,hurled anathema at the Labour move-,59
NA,ment. But the Prime Minister is one of,59
NA,those who assisted to build up thab move-,59
NA,"ment, and who always insisted that no",59
NA,man was superior to i t . Yet at the first,59
NA,opportunity he attempted to smash i t .,59
Mr LYNCH ,Doe s the honorable mem-,59

Mr MATHEWS , I do.,59
Mr THOMAS ,What pledge did he,59
NA,break 1,59
Mr MATHEWS ,H e left the party.,59
Mr THOMAS ,H e was driven out.,59
NA,was declared disloyal by the executive.,59
Mr MATHEWS ,I t is - well,59
NA,that tbe Prime Minister at a certain stage,59
NA,of that Caucus meeting announced that,59
NA,"he intended to leave it, and invited",59
NA,supporters to follow him.,59
Mr LYNCH ,Doe s the honorable mem-,59
NA,ber say that the party had power to,59
NA,tain him as their leader after he had been,59
NA,expelled by the outside organizations?,59
Mr MATHEWS ,H e had been exme,59
NA,pelled by his league when we met at that,59
NA,"meeting, and eat under him.",59
Mr THOMAS ,An d i t was at once in this House.,59
NA,moved that he should be deposed.,59
Mr MATHEWS , Mr Hughes was,59
NA,the chairman of a duly constituted meettion?,59
NA,ing of the Labour party.,59
Mr THOMAS ,Wha t was the first,59
NA,motion submitted?,59
Mr MATHEWS ,I t was a motion my political skin.,59
NA,calling upon the Prime Minister to make a,59
NA,"statement on the position, which he re-",59
NA,fused to do. Evidently he desired to as-,59
NA,"certain the temper of that meeting,",59
NA,I admit that he soon got i t . Yet for,59
NA,"hours he sat in the chair, and left the",59
NA,"room of his own accord, after inviting",59
NA,supporters to follow him.,59
Mr WEBSTER ,Afte r a number of men,59
NA,had told him that they had to vote as they,59
NA,had been instructed.,59
Mr HANNAN ,Tha t statement,59
NA,never made.,59
Mr WEBSTER ,"I t was, and the honorsometimes",59
NA,able member was one of those who made,59
NA,it.,59
Mr MATHEWS,Th e Prime Minister,59
NA,deliberately broke up the Labour move-,59
NA,The ment by inviting his supporters to leave,59
NA,the meeting witli him. Is it any wonder,59
NA,"that, in the circumstances, there is a",59
NA,strong feeling against him by members of,59
NA,Australian Labour party ? But so far,59
NA,"as personal friendships go, tliere is no sign",59
NA,"of a "" r i f t in the lute."" Yet the Prime Min-",59
NA,ister tells us that against him alone is the,59
NA,whole strength of the Labour movement,59
NA,directed. How many Labour members,59
NA,would have been in this Parliament to-,59
NA,day but for the solidarity of the Labour,59
NA,movement? Wantonly the Prime Minis-,59
NA,"ter broke up .the movement, and he must",59
NA,accept the blame for so doing. I n the cir-,59
NA,"cumstances, all his nasty remarks concern-",59
NA,ing the Labour party go by the board.,59
NA,How many times during the past ten,59
NA,years has he been told by those with whom,59
NA,he is now associated that a Labour repre-,59
NA,"sentative ""was not allowed to exercise his",59
NA,He brains-tha t the Caucus stultified him?,59
NA,Yet he submitted to all that sort of criti-,59
NA,known cism until quite recently.,59
Mr LYNCH ,Wa s not the honorable,59
NA,member himself the first man in the,59
NA,his Caucus to demand a free hand in this,59
NA,place ?,59
Mr MATHEWS , I wish to deal with,59
NA,rethat phase of the question. The honor-,59
NA,able member for Denison referred to i t in,59
NA,"my absence, but was good enough to tell",59
NA,that he intended to do so. I am very,59
NA,pleased that he did bring the matter for-,59
NA,ward. He has strengthened my position,59
Mr THOMAS ,An d in the coming elec-,59
Mr MATHEWS ,Yes . The honor-,59
NA,able member told me the other night that,59
NA,I was only an anti-conscriptionist to save,59
Mr THOMAS ,I.certainl y did not.,59
Mr MATHEWS ,"Well , such a taunt",59
NA,and has been thrown at me in this House.,59
NA,Let me explain my attitude in regard to,59
NA,conscription. I was born and reared in,59
NA,"his the British Army, which was brought to-",59
NA,gether on the voluntary system. The,59
NA,"British soldiery, with whom I associated",59
NA,"for years, were always pointing proudly",59
NA,to the fact that Britain had a volunteer,59
NA,was army as against the conscript army of the,59
NA,Continent. Conscription was talked of,59
NA,"in Great Britain, and there",59
NA,was such a thing as men being com-,59
NA,pelled to enlist because of being thrown,59
NA,out of work. There was also a mea-,60
NA,sure of conscription i n connexion with the,60
NA,militia ; b u t I always found that every,60
NA,man in the British A r m y was against con-,60
NA,scription. That was the atmosphere i n,60
NA,which I was reared. When this war,60
NA,"broke out, that fact did not prevent me",60
NA,from standing side by side with others i n,60
NA,the endeavour to p ut before those who,60
NA,were fit to go to the front the seriousness,60
NA,of our position - Night after night I did,60
NA,that i n common with other members of,60
NA,"Parliament; and, because I did so, I was",60
NA,told that i t was easy to tell by my speeches,60
NA,"that I was at heart a conscriptionist, b u t",60
NA,was afraid to say so. To that charge. 1,60
NA,replied that I went on the pnblic plat-,60
NA,form to advocate voluntary enlistment be-,60
NA,cause of my utter detestation of conscrip-,60
NA,tion.,60
Mr WEBSTER ,Wha t would have hapthe,60
NA,pened i n this war i f England had not,60
NA,been conscripted ?,60
Mr MATHEWS , I do not think ing,60
NA,that conscription has placed an additional nearest port.,60
NA,man on the fields of France. The,60
NA,effect that conscription i n England has,60
NA,had lias been i n connexion with industry. tion would be worse than i t is.,60
NA,I come now to the Caucus meeting. When,60
NA,"the Prime Minister saw the light, and",60
NA,was talking of taking a vote on this quesfood.,60
NA,"tion of conscription, I said that I refused",60
NA,"to vote upon i t because, even i f the",60
NA,"position were carried, I would not supchange.",60
NA,"port i t . Rather than do so, I would have",60
NA,"gone out of the Labour movement, and",60
NA,would not have opposed the man who was,60
NA,selected to take my place. I was,60
NA,going to throw to the winds the opinion,60
NA,that I had held f o r years on this queshonorable,60
NA,tion. One of my principal reasons f,60
NA,opposing conscription is that I desire that,60
NA,justice shall be done to those who enlist.,60
NA,"So far as I am concerned, i t is a matter,",60
NA,"not of sentiment, but of hard facts. Men",60
NA,who go to the fron t are not treated f a i,60
NA,their wives and families are not treated,60
NA,"fairly, and they themselves are not",60
NA,when they return. We already have,60
NA,"20,000 men awaiting repatriation. I f",60
NA,"could be compelled to enlist, there would",60
NA,be no repatriation and no 6s. a day f o,60
NA,"them. The Hororata, which left here",60
NA,"wards the end of last year, carried a large go.""",60
NA,"number of recruits for the front, and for",60
NA,twenty-four days those men were supplied commissioned officer.,60
NA,"with rotten meat. On Christmas Day,",60
NA,the men committed i t to the deep with,60
NA,musical honours. I complained of this three years' imprisonment.,60
NA,to-day i n the Parliament House grounds,60
NA,to a gentleman who is endeavouring to do,60
NA,"well by Australia, and his only reply was,",60
NA,""" Mathews, we have to win the w a r . """,60
NA,Are we going to win i t by supplying our,60
NA,men with bad meat?,60
Mr LAIRD SMITH , I t is the Queens-,60
NA,land Labour Government that is supplying,60
NA,the meat.,60
Mr TUDOR ,No ; thig meat was sup,60
NA,plied i n Victoria. I was a Minister at,60
NA,T,60
NA,"the time, and I know the firms responsible",60
NA,for i t . I p u t a stop to such meat going,60
NA,away.,60
Mr LAIRD SMITH ,Th e best Queens-,60
NA,land meat is going into the boats to-day.,60
Mr MATHEWS , O n every transport,60
NA,we have an officer of high rank. Brigadier-,60
NA,General Williams is to leave i n charge of,60
NA,"a transport, and I know him well enough",60
NA,to believe that i f he found he had only,60
NA,"bad meat for his men, he would put into",60
NA,first port and obtain a fresh supply.,60
NA,When the officer i n charge of the men on,60
NA,the Hororata knew that bad meat was be-,60
NA,"supplied, he should have made for the",60
NA,The men responsible for,60
NA,only the supply of such stuff should have been,60
NA,"hanged. I f we had compulsion, the posi-",60
NA,I n one par-,60
NA,"ticular camp on Salisbury Plain, the men",60
NA,for five weeks did not receive sufficient,60
NA,The fool in charge of them did not,60
NA,know how to improve the position; b u t,60
NA,prothe officer who replaced him soon made a,60
NA,I f men could be compelled to,60
NA,"enlist, they would soon be treated as the",60
NA,German conscripts are treated whenever,60
NA,the opportunity offers. The authorities,60
NA,not have a nice way of dealing with men i n,60
NA,the Army who try to redress wrongs. The,60
NA,"member for Denison, while As-",60
NA,"o r sistant Minister for Defence, took up one",60
NA,"case for us-th e case of Quill, Fountain,",60
NA,and Dalton-an d reduced to eighteen,60
NA,months their sentence of three years' im-,60
NA,prisonment. They were sentenced to three,60
NA,r l y ; years' imprisonment f o r refusing to go,60
NA,to a waterless place without taking a suf-,60
NA,ficient supply of water. They had had ex-,60
NA,"perience of i t , and when they urged that",60
NA,men they should take something more than,60
NA,"their water-bottles with them, the sergeant",60
NA,"r in charge said, "" I have been ordered t o",60
NA,"totake out this detachment, and you must",60
NA,This was somewhere on the Canal.,60
NA,The men brought the matter before a,60
NA,"Quill, Fountain,",60
NA,and Dalton were elected as their spokes-,60
NA,"men, and their reward was a sentence of",60
NA,They were,60
NA,"sent back to Australia, where we have a",60
NA,nasty Parliament which intervenes i n such,60
NA,cases. The result is tliat their sentences,61
NA,have been reduced. B u t no other men,61
NA,under sentence are to be sent back to Aus-,61
NA,tralia. They are to remain where tliere is,61
NA,no one to advocate leniency or justice.,61
Mr LYNCH ,Thi s is a good recruiting,61
NA,argument.,61
Sir JOHN FORREST , I t w i l l bring i n a,61
NA,lot of recruits.,61
Mr MATHEWS , N o doubt.,61
NA,is why I say to the Win-the-War party,61
NA,that they should perfect their repatriation,61
NA,"scheme, and look after the men who enlist.",61
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Doe s,61
NA,able member want us to win this war ?,61
Mr MATHEWS , M y patriotism goes,61
NA,further than the mere lip-patriotism of,61
NA,the Win-the-War party. They will not,61
NA,tell about the rotten meat that was served,61
NA,"to the men on the Hororata, and that is",61
NA,one reason why there is trouble over this,61
NA,question.,61
Sir JOHN FORREST ,On e would thin k,61
NA,they never got anything else but rotten,61
NA,meat.,61
Mr MATHEWS , I know that that,61
NA,is not the case. B u t I say these things,61
NA,ought to be remedied.,61
Sir JOHN FORREST ,-If c was,61
NA,say for them to eat the rotten meat.,61
NA,They could have gone without i t .,61
Mr MATHEWS ,The y could not get,61
NA,anything else. One reason why I am,61
NA,not a conscriptionist is because even under,61
NA,the voluntary system the men are not,61
NA,treated properly. Another reason is,61
NA,that because Australia is different from,61
NA,any other part of the Empire. The hon-,61
NA,orable member for Bendigo explained the,61
NA,position. Canada has been making,61
NA,shells by the million. And what a nice,61
NA,attempt we made! The British Go-,61
NA,"vernment, however, are now taking our",61
NA,artisans and our steel to England to,61
NA,manufacture shells tliere. We were told,61
NA,thafc we were too far away from England,61
NA,"to undertake this work, that they were",61
NA,"altering the gauges too often, and that",61
NA,we could not get the proper formula for,61
NA,fche steel. I do not blame the Minister f or,61
NA,"Defence for this, because as far back as Oc-",61
NA,"tober, 1914, he endeavoured to get from the",61
NA,British Government formula for the steel,61
NA,"for shrapnel shells, but without success.",61
NA,"Mr MCKay, who took an interest i n the",61
NA,"Munitions Committee, went away to",61
NA,"America, and he brought back with him a",61
NA,formula which was found to be obsolete,61
NA,and useless. The engineers i n my elec-,61
NA,torate then came to me to arrange a de-,61
NA,"putation to the Minister f or Defence, but",61
NA,"the Minister said i t was no good, because",61
NA,he could not get the formula from the,61
NA,British Governmenb. I w i l l tell the,61
NA,House why he could not get that for-,61
NA,mula. I t was because i t is a trade,61
NA,"secret of Armstrong's, and the Vickers,",61
NA,"Maxims, and the rest, who are making",61
NA,the shells i n England.,61
Mr GREGORY , Then how did they,61
NA,"manage to get the formula i n Canada,",61
NA,"Japan, and the United States?",61
Mr MATHEWS ,The y must have,61
NA,"the honor- got i t afterwards, bufc Australia could",61
NA,not get ifc. I want to know why this,61
NA,formula for shrapnel shells is held by,61
NA,"private firms, while men by the million",61
NA,are shedding their blood for the Empire.,61
Sir JOHN FORREST , I do not thin k,61
NA,that that was the trouble i n Australia.,61
NA,I believe the steel was defective.,61
Mr MATHEWS ," O f course i t was,",61
NA,because we could not get the proper for-,61
NA,mula.,61
Mr GREGORY ,I t has taken you a,61
NA,long time to find this out.,61
Mr MATHEWS ," N o , ifc has not.",61
NA,I mentioned the matter eighteen months,61
NA,ago. The honorable member will find my,61
NA,unnecesremarks in Hansard showing that I,61
NA,brought i t up then.,61
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Yo u had your,61
NA,own Government i n power then.,61
Mr MATHEWS , I know we did.,61
Sir JOHN FORREST ,The n why did you,61
NA,not do something ?,61
Mr MATHEWS , I am nofc blaming,61
NA,this Government afc all over fche matter.,61
NA,I am blaming the British Government.,61
NA,"I n regard to this war, Australia is dif-",61
NA,ferent from every other part of the Em-,61
NA,pire. Only last Saturday there appeared,61
NA,a cable message i n the Herald stating,61
NA,that the trade i n Canada had increased,61
NA,"enormously, thab the industries of the",61
NA,"Dominion were working three shifts, pro-",61
NA,"ducing commodities and munitions, and",61
NA,there was nobody out of work. I n Aus-,61
NA,"tralia, on the other hand, there are",61
NA,"thousands of men unemployed, and I",61
NA,want to see these things righted.,61
Mr GREGORY ,Dampier) [11.0] - I,61

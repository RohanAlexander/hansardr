NA,Whereas before Europeans settled in Australia the Abor-,14
NA,iginal peoples of Australia had lived on their traditional,14
NA,lands from time immemorial and had in Aboriginal law and,14
NA,customs a clear title to those lands; and,14
NA,whereas Europeans and other non-Aboriginal people,14
NA,have occupied and used most of the traditional lands of the,14
NA,Aboriginal peoples against their will and without nego-,14
NA,"tiation, compensation or treaty; and",14
NA,whereas it has been the practice of nations established in,14
NA,territories previously occupied by indigenous inhabitants to,14
NA,reach a negotiated settlement with those inhabitants; and,14
NA,whereas that occupation has seriously damaged the tradi-,14
NA,tional way oflife of Aboriginal Australians and has caused,14
NA,poverty and hardship to be the fate of the great majority of,14
NA,their surviving descendants; and,14
NA,whereas the surviving descendants of the Aboriginal,14
NA,peoples have expressed a wish to have their rights to land,14
NA,"acknowledged, to preserve their link with their Aboriginal",14
NA,ancestors and to maintain their distinctive identity with its,14
NA,own cultural heritage; and,14
NA,whereas the people of Australia in 1967 voted overwhelm-,14
NA,ingly that the Commonwealth Parliament should have re-,14
NA,sponsibility for laws relating to Aboriginal Australians; and,14
NA,whereas it is accepted internationally by the United,14
NA,Nations organisation that each country should work to,14
NA,establish the rights of indigenous peoples to self-,14
NA,"determination, non-discrimination and the enjoyment of",14
NA,PETITIONS their own culture; and,14
NA,whereas the Woodward Commission in 1974 established,14
NA,principles by which Aboriginal rights to land should be,14
NA,acknowledged and realised; and,14
NA,whereas the Senate of the Commonwealth Parliament in,14
NA,Pensions February 1975resolvedthat Aboriginal Australians should,14
NA,be compensated for the loss of their traditional lands and for,14
NA,the damage to their way oflife; and,14
NA,whereas the Nauonal Aboriginal Conference unani-,14
NA,mously resolved in April 1979 in Canberra to ask the Com-,14
NA,monwealth to negotiate a Treaty with Aboriginal,14
NA,Australians.,14
NA,terms requires upward adjust-,14
NA,Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Common-,14
NA,wealth Government should invite the Aboriginal people of,14
NA,Australia to negotiate a Treaty with the Commonwealth of,14
NA,"Australia, and any Treaty should contain provisions relating",14
NA,to the following matters: (i) The protection of Aboriginal,14
NA,"identity, languages, law and culture, (ii) The recognition and",14

NA,governments so that the unemployed can be granted,14
NA,transport concessions in order that they are not,14
NA,penalised in job seeking.,14
NA,(6) That pharmaceutical and medical concessions be,15

NA,"that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:",18
NA,(1) That this House notes with concern:,18
NA,(a) the variation which exists throughout Australia in the,18
NA,retail price of petrol and the serious disadvantage,18
NA,certain country areas;,18
NA,(b) the ability of the oil companies to vary the wholesale,18
NA,price of petrol well below the maximum wholesale,18

NA,(c) the increasing involvement of some oil companies in,18
NA,the retail market through the introduction of com-,18
NA,mission agents.,18
NA,"(2) That this House, recognising the fundamental import-",18

NA,War Memorial Act 1962 requires that the Australian War,18
NA,Memorial shall be a National Memorial to Australians who,18

NA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,18
NA,schools will receive an in-,18
NA,INTERNATIONAL AIRLINE,18
NA,Education expenditure 1980 and,18
NA,OPERATIONS,18
Mr HAYDEN, I ask a question of the Minis-,18
NA,ter for Transport. I refer to 'disinterested',18
NA,reports-o f course the word 'disinterested' is in,18
NA,inverted commas for obvious reasons-comin g,18
NA,from the Murdoch newspapers confidently,18
NA,predicting that Ansett Transport Industries Ltd,18
NA,will be given approval by the Government to,18
NA,enter into overseas airline operations. I ask the,18
NA,Notice of Motion Minister whether any such approval for Ansett,18
NA,would also involve fair and equal treatment for,18
NA,Trans-Australia Airlines by allowing it to operate,18
NA,internationally too. Is it a simple economic fact,18
NA,that this sort of sudden growth in domestic based,18
NA,international airline operations will increase the,18
NA,to seating capacity at a much more rapid rate than,18
NA,growth in available passenger traffic? Would this,18
NA,result in quite large and costly diseconomies for,18
NA,Qantas Airways Ltd which ultimately would,18
NA,have to be borne by the community? Would the,18
NA,result of such a development be the substitution,18
NA,ofthe present small domestic international oper-,18
NA,ator by two or three minute and unviable inter-,18
NA,"national operators with clear cost disadvantages,",18
NA,again ultimately borne by the community?,18
NA,"Finally, to remove any suspicion that Mr",18
NA,Murdoch is seeking to apply the same Svengali-,19
NA,like influence on the Australian Government he,19
NA,"has brought to bear on President Carter, will he",19
NA,provide the Parliament with a comprehensive,19
NA,analysis of the economics of additional overseas,19
NA,airline operations being approved for Ansett?,19
Mr HUNT,The proposal by Ansett,19
NA,Transport Industries Ltd involves a lot of factors,19
NA,which will be taken into account before the,19
NA,' Government finally takes a decision. Two pro-,19
NA,posals to improve the international access by air,19
NA,to Australia's Great Barrier Reef are currently,19
NA,"receiving consideration. Firstly, Ansett Trans-",19
NA,port Industries has made an application for an,19
NA,international airline licence to operate services,19
NA,between Townsville and Singapore in its own,19
NA,"right as an international carrier. Secondly, Qan-",19
NA,tas Airways Ltd has announced a change in its,19
NA,scheduled services through Darwin. Sub-,19
NA,sequently Trans-Australia Airways has applied,19
NA,to open a new route-Townsville-Cairns -,19
NA,Darwin-t o connect up with the revised Qantas,19
NA,schedule. This rearranged schedule would pro-,19
NA,vide a Singapore-Townsville service.,19
NA,It is also open to Ansett to consider arrange-,19
NA,ments under which its services might make better,19
NA,connections with the services operated by the in-,19
NA,ternational airlines. The Government announced,19
NA,in October 1978 that Qantas would continue at,19
NA,least until 1981 as the sole Australian airline,19
NA,authorised to operate overseas air services. I,19
NA,know that the Ansett proposal has attracted a,19
NA,great deal of support and a great deal of local,19
NA,public interest. Since the proposal involves,19
NA,government policy and the interests of other,19
NA,"governments, it will be considered by the",19
NA,Government against that background in due,19
NA,course.,19
NA,For the information of the Leader of the Op-,19
NA,"position and other honourable members, there",19
NA,are a number of important issues which would,19
NA,have to be considered by the Government. They,19
NA,include whether Qantas should remain,19
NA,Australia's sole international carrier; whether,19
NA,Townsville should be the only gateway port in,19
NA,North Queensland for an air link with South East,19
NA,Asia; what supporting facilities and,19
NA,"would be needed, and what priority these should",19
NA,be given relative to similar demands at other,19
NA,centres in Australia. There would also be a,19
NA,to consult overseas governments which have,19
NA,interest in the matter. There is also the considerNovember,19
NA,ation of Qantas being entitled to carry passenthe,19
NA,gers over some domestic routes in Australia.,19
NA,l'hcy .II- - iiiipiiii.ini and complex issues thai t.nuin,19
NA,amiioi IK di.tli iih quickly Hie Government,19
NA,will also need to consider the proposals for pro-,19
NA,viding more effective co-ordination between,19
NA,domestic and international services at existing,19
NA,"gateways. So, the Government has a great",19
NA,number of factors to take into account before it,19
NA,can deal finally with the application for this ser-,19
NA,vice. I understand that TAA has also expressed,19
NA,"an interest in regional international routes,",19
NA,should its competitor on the domestic routes be,19
NA,given access to an international regional route.,19
NA,OMEGA NAVIGATION AID SITE:,19
NA,INDUSTRIAL DISPUTE,19
Mr SHIPTON,Is the Minister for Industrial,19
NA,Relations aware of an industrial dispute at the,19
NA,Omega navigation aid site in Victoria? Is it a de-,19
NA,"marcation dispute, that is, a fight between two or",19
NA,more unions? What action is the Government,19
NA,taking to help resolve this matter?,19
Mr STREET, I am aware of a dispute which,19
NA,has arisen at the Omega site. The cause of the,19
NA,dispute is demands by the Australian Building,19
NA,Construction Employees and Builders Labourers,19
NA,Federation that its members do the work in-,19
NA,volved in erecting the transmission mast at the,19
NA,Omega station. This work is currently being done,19
NA,by members of the Federated Ironworkers As-,19
NA,"sociation of AustraUa, and the BLF is now using",19
NA,industrial action to press its demands. As the,19
NA,"honourable member has said, the dispute is a de-",19
NA,marcation one involving who does the work on,19
NA,"the mast and, as in all demarcation disputes, the",19
NA,trade union movement has an obligation to see,19
NA,that work on the site continues pending resol-,19
NA,ution of the dispute.,19
NA,I point out that in 1977 this Government,19
NA,passed legislation strengthening the powers of,19
NA,the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to,19
NA,deal with disputes of this kind. These processes,19
NA,have not yet been exhausted. The Government is,19
NA,trying to ensure that the legislation which was,19
NA,passed then is used in the way in which it was,19
NA,intended to be used. We condemn the attempts,19
NA,by the BLF to win coverage through industrial,19
NA,"action on this site, and we are keeping the pos-",19
NA,ition under review.,19
NA,services PUBLIC DUTY AND PRIVATE INTEREST,19
Mr LIONEL BOWEN,I refer the Prime,19
NA,need Minister to the following statement made by the,19
NA,an Deputy Prime Minister in the Parliament on 22,19
NA,last in relation to what is known as,19
NA,Bowen report on public duty and private,19
NA,interest:,19
NA,. . . the Government will proceed with the implemen-,19
NA,"nl"" prupo.sal.s made in llie ivpori lhal all'eci Ministers,",19
NA,piihlu. sei\ .nils and .illii'i f >I)IM.IK,19
NA,I ask the Prime Minister: Have all the proposals,20
NA,"been implemented? If not, what are the reasons,",20
NA,and when will the other recommendations in the,20
NA,report be acted upon?,20
Mr MALCOLM FRASER,I thank the,20
NA,honourable gentleman for reminding me of these,20
NA,matters. Ministers have been asked to make dec-,20
NA,larations in terms of the widened criteria sug-,20
NA,gested in the Bowen report. The Public Service,20
NA,Board has in train measures which would apply,20
NA,the provisions of the report to public servants. As,20
NA,"for members of this Parliament, since some im-",20
NA,portant matters were involved it was the Govern-,20
NA,ment's view that they should be fully debated in,20
NA,the Parliament as well as in the respective party,20
NA,rooms. We will need to make sure that that pro-,20
NA,cess is put in train before the end of this session.,20
NA,GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK,20
Mr MILLAR, I ask the Minister for Science,20
NA,and the Environment whether there has been a,20
NA,general endorsement by interested parties and,20
NA,persons of the Government's proclamation,20
NA,the Capricornia section of the Great Barrier Reef,20
NA,Marine Park in October 1979. What action does,20
NA,the Government propose taking to consolidate way.,20
NA,that significant event?,20
NA,Mr THOMSONI thank the honourable,20
NA,"member for his question, which concerns a mat-",20
NA,ter of deep interest to all Queenslanders and,20
NA,"Australians, because the Great Barrier Reef is which",20
NA,part of our great national heritage. On 28 March,20
NA,the Great Barrier Reef Ministerial Council,20
NA,proved the declaration of the Capricornia section,20
NA,of the reef as a marine park. A zoning plan was,20
NA,agreed to and has gone out for public comment,20
NA,for a period of two months until 6 June. When,20
NA,"that public comment has been considered, a",20
NA,mal zoning and management plan will be agreed,20
NA,"to by the Ministerial Council, in June or July.",20
NA,Ministerial Council has also agreed that the,20
NA,section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park,20
NA,be declared should be that area which is off to,20
NA,Cairns. Next month public comment on that proEEC,20
NA,posal will be sought for a period of one month.,20
NA,"When that public comment has been considered,",20
NA,a zoning plan for the Cairns section will,20
NA,pared by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park policies?,20
NA,Authority. These two sections are the most used,20
NA,portions of the Great Barrier Reef and they com-,20
NA,prise about 25 per cent of the length of the,20
NA,"or some 500 kilometres out of the 2,000 kiloports",20
NA,"metres of the reef, stretching from just north",20
NA,Bundaberg to the tip of Cape York. In my view,20
NA,is quite impractical to declare the whole of the,20
NA,Great Barrier Reef a marine park. Unlike,20
NA,national park a marine park is meant for the use,20
NA,of people.,20
Mr YOUNG ,Tha t is a good point.,20
NA,"Mr THOMSONI t must be used and, at the",20
NA,"same time, protected. I invite the honourable",20
NA,member to visit the Great Barrier Reef and have,20
NA,a look at it. It is perhaps a coincidence that I am,20
NA,the Minister in this place who is responsible for,20
NA,"the protection ofthe Great Barrier Reef, because",20
NA,"I am a keen scuba diver, as are also the members",20
NA,of my family. I live within a few kilometres ofthe,20
NA,reef and I am very concerned about its,20
NA,protection.,20
NA,There have been comments about possible,20
NA,mining on the reef. On 14 June last year the,20
NA,"Prime Minister, conjointly with the Premier of",20
NA,"Queensland, made the statement: 'There will be",20
NA,no drilling on the Great Barrier Reef and no,20
NA,drilling will be allowed which will damage the,20
NA,reef. No mining exploration will be allowed until,20
NA,both short term and long term scientific reviews,20
NA,have been made'. I am confident that both this,20
NA,of Government and the Queensland Government,20
NA,are doing all they can to protect the reef. That,20
NA,"must be done in a sensible, rational and practical",20
NA,TRADE WITH THE EUROPEAN,20
NA,ECONOMIC COMMUNITY,20
Mr HURFORD," I preface my question,",20
NA,is directed to the Minister for Trade and,20
NA,"Resources and Deputy Prime Minister, by noting",20
NA,"the presence in Australia of Mr Haferkamp, a",20
NA,apcommissioner of the European Economic Com-,20
NA,"munity with responsibilities for trade. Indeed, I",20
NA,"noted his presence in this House yesterday but,",20
NA,"regrettably, Mr Speaker, I failed to catch your",20
NA,"eye to ask my question, which is: Is the Govern-",20
NA,forment taking the opportunity of Mr Haferkamp's,20
NA,visit to express Australia's grave concern about,20
NA,The the restrictionist agricultural policies of the,20
NA,"next European Economic Community? If so, in what",20
NA,to terms are our concerns being expressed? Are we,20
NA,allow Australia's $1.5 billion trade deficit with,20
NA,countries to be reduced by our being merely,20
NA,"a quarry for Europe with few jobs resulting, or",20
NA,are we to undertake some hard bargaining to,20
NA,be prebreak down the Community's restrictionist,20
Mr ANTHONY, I think the honourable,20
NA,"reef, member, when he reads tomorrow's Press re-",20
NA,of the statement I have already delivered to,20
NA,"of the Commission of the European Communities,",20
NA,it will know the answer to all those questions that,20
NA,he has asked. In that statement I made the point,20
NA,a concerning the imbalance of trade between,20
NA,Australia and the countries of the European,21
NA,Community and said that it was very much in,21
NA,favour of the Community. Whilst we are not,21
NA,gravely concerned about the imbalance because,21
NA,"we consider ourselves multilateral traders, we",21
NA,are concerned when there is not equal oppor-,21
NA,tunity for our trade to take place. Unless we can,21
NA,"get reasonable access to and growth in a market,",21
NA,we are at a distinct disadvantage. For a country,21
NA,"such as Australia, which is a major food exporter,",21
NA,there is a distinct disadvantage in the common,21
NA,agricultural policy-CAP-whic h is gravely limit-,21
NA,ing our access to European markets. These points,21
NA,have been made strongly to members of the,21
NA,Commission during their visit here.,21
NA,We are also making use of this opportunity to,21
NA,talk about our total relations-abou t our political,21
NA,relations and about areas of common interest,21
NA,and concern to us both. We are using it to en-,21
NA,courage European investment in this country and,21
NA,to encourage European countries to utilise some,21
NA,of our forms of energy as an alternative to oil to,21
NA,help them with their energy problems. I see this,21
NA,visit as a very important one for strengthening,21
NA,lationships between Australia and the Com-,21
NA,munity. In the course of the multilateral trade,21
NA,negotiations we made some progress in getting,21
NA,some access to European countries for agricul-,21
NA,tural commodities. We see that as a bridgehead,21
NA,for making further progress. The progress we,21
NA,have made in that regard should not be accepted,21
NA,as the end of the road. We will keep pushing to,21
NA,try to get greater access into the European mar-,21
NA,ket because we believe that ultimately the sub-,21
NA,ventionist and subsidy policies of the Com-,21
NA,munity will defeat themselves under their own,21
NA,weight. We believe that it is completely wrong to,21
NA,place an embargo on trade in foodstuffs when we,21
NA,in turn have placed no embargo on the Com-,21
NA,munity's exports to Australia.,21
NA,ETHANOL PRODUCTION,21
Mr COTTER,Is the Minister for Business,21
NA,and Consumer Affairs aware of the enormous,21
NA,interest in the Federal Government's decision to,21
NA,allow farmers to produce ethanol for fuel? When,21
NA,will the Government be issuing experimenter li-,21
NA,cences for the production of ethanol? Can the,21
NA,Minister assure the House that farmers in the,21
NA,Kalgoorlie electorate will be amongst the first to,21
NA,receive licences?,21
Mr GARLAND,The position is that legis-,21
NA,lation to provide experimenter licences is at,21
NA,present before the Senate. It provides for the,21
NA,issue of some 50 licences. Applications for,21
NA,cences were invited some time ago by circular,21
NA,and Press release. I have had two inquiries from,21
NA,applicants from the Kalgoorlie electorate; but,21
NA,overall only some 26 formal applications have,21
NA,"been received at present, although there has",21
NA,been a great deal of interest. These are being,21
NA,progressively examined and assessed by my,21
NA,Department and by that of the Minister for,21
NA,National Development and Energy in antici-,21
NA,pation of the legislation. Most of them appear to,21
NA,"be based on genuine research projects and, as",21
NA,"such, I would expect them to be approved. Cer-",21
NA,tainly advice will be sent to all applicants very,21
NA,soon and I expect that all legislative,21
NA,requirements-,21
NA,Mr MCLean-When ?,21
Mr GARLAND,A s the assessment is,21
NA,"completed, but the legislation is not yet in place.",21
NA,Then there will be a necessity for gazettal of,21
NA,regulations. I expect that all that process will be,21
NA,finished during the next month.,21
NA,CHIEF JUSTICE OF AUSTRALIA,21
Mr LEO MCLEAY, I direct my question to,21
NA,the Acting Attorney-General. Has the Minister's,21
NA,reattention been drawn to an article in the Sydney,21
NA,Daily Telegraph of today's date which indicates,21
NA,that the New South Wales Corporate Affairs,21
NA,Commission is moving to have a company struck,21
NA,from the register for failing to provide annual re-,21
NA,turns since 1973? Is he aware that this company,21
NA,owns the home of the Chief Justice of Australia,21
NA,"in George Street, Careel Bay? Will the Minister",21
NA,indicate whether the Government may recon-,21
NA,sider its decision not to provide the Chief Justice,21
NA,with palatial accommodation in Canberra if the,21
NA,home is sold up for the payment of fines?,21
Mr ELLICOTT,Th e question is simply,21
NA,answered by saying that there is no proposal to,21
NA,provide the Chief Justice with accommodation,21
NA,by way of a home in the Australian Capital,21
NA,Territory.,21
NA,SOVIET INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN,21
Mr NA BROWN,I ask the Prime Minister:,21
NA,Has there been an almost universal condem-,21
NA,"nation of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, a",21
NA,"condemnation expressed by the United Nations,",21
NA,"the Islamic Conference, including even the",21
NA,"Palestine Liberation Organisation, all members",21
NA,"of the Association of South East Asian Nations,",21
NA,most Asian and western European countries and,21
NA,even some European communist parties?,21
Mr YOUNG ,Probabl y even Indonesia.,21
Mr NA BROWN,We will see where the,21
NA,liLabor Party stands. In that case can the Prime,21
NA,Minister say whether there has been any ex-,21
NA,pression of pleasure at the Soviet invasion of,21
NA,Afghanistan or any expression of the view that,22
NA,"one should rejoice at that invasion? If so, from",22
NA,what quarters has that expression of opinion,22
NA,come and what would be the implications for,22
NA,Australia's national security if onegave support,22
NA,within Australia to the expression of that view?,22
Dr KLUGMAN , I take a point of order. Mr,22
NA,"Speaker, this is not under the direction of the",22
NA,Prime Minister or any other Minister. An,22
NA,honourable member cannot ask whether there,22
NA,has been any expression of opinion anywhere on,22
NA,this issue. What is the proposition?,22
Mr SPEAKER,The question is seeking infor-,22
NA,mation from the head of the Government ofthe,22
NA,"Commonwealth, I take it, in order that the infor-",22
NA,mation can be taken into account by the honour-,22
NA,able member in forming his views about a matter,22
NA,of international importance.,22
Mr HAYDEN , I take a point of order. I find,22
NA,"your ruling fascinating, Mr Speaker. I would re-",22
NA,mind you that you ruled that the Prime Minister,22
NA,was not responsible for the behaviour ofhis Min-,22
NA,isters when a series of questions were raised,22
NA,lation to the business interests and conduct of the,22
NA,former Minister for Primary Industry. I merely,22
NA,raise this matter if you are determined to allow,22
NA,the Prime Minister to go ahead and answer this,22
NA,"question. Incidentally, we repudiate the view",22
NA,which was expressed in the paper-,22
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The honourable,22
NA,gentleman will make his point of order.,22
Mr HAYDEN ," Mr Speaker, I think in all the cir-",22
NA,cumstances you ought to allow me to finish be-,22
NA,cause our assessment of the impartiality or other-,22
NA,wise with which you administer the affairs of this,22
NA,Parliament will very much be weighed in the bal-,22
NA,ance according to how you determine this mat-,22
NA,"ter. I remind you, Mr Speaker, of your very tough",22
NA,rulings in relation to a series of questions to,22
NA,"Ministers-on e series, of course, specifically re-",22
NA,lated to the former Minister for Primary,22
NA,Industry-a s to the probity of their conduct as,22
NA,Ministers and sometimes in relation to both the,22
NA,discharge of their duty as public office holders,22
NA,and conflict of interest arising from the probity,22
NA,"their behaviour in, for instance, personal busi-",22
NA,ness matters. I remind you that your initial ruling,22
NA,was to allow those questions but later you made,22
NA,a most restrictive ruling on these matters. If you,22
NA,"are to rule today that, suddenly, because it",22
NA,appears that the circumstances have been,22
NA,directed towards this side of the House it is ac-,22
NA,"ceptable, well, of course, you are the Speaker",22
NA,and your ruling I suppose will prevail; but it will,22
NA,have devastating consequences on the con-,22
NA,"fidence, if not the respect, that you expect to",22
NA,"obtain from this side of the House, because ofthe",22
NA,inconsistency.,22
Mr SPEAKER,I ruled on that question. I,22
NA,gave my reasons. The Leader of the Opposition,22
NA,-,22
NA,then put to me an earlier ruling I gave. My recol-,22
NA,lection of my earlier ruling is that I did permit,22
NA,questions of the Prime Minister concerning every,22
NA,"Minister, but I did not permit questions of the",22
NA,Prime Minister in relation to Ministers on mat-,22
NA,ters for which the Ministers were not answerable,22
NA,to this House. I did permit questions to be asked,22
NA,of the right honourable gentleman as to his con-,22
NA,fidence in Ministers. I see no relationship whatso-,22
NA,ever between this question and the other series of,22
NA,questions. It is unfortunate that the Leader of the,22
NA,Opposition should put his argument in a form,22
NA,that suggests that if I do not agree with him he,22
NA,will regard me as lacking impartiality. What,22
NA,must be borne in mind by every member of the,22
NA,House is that my impartiality will not be judged,22
NA,"on whether I please a member, any number of",22
NA,members or any party. I will make my judgments,22
NA,as I feel to be proper and announce them. If the,22
NA,in rehonourable gentleman disagrees with them he,22
NA,may challenge them within the forms of the,22
NA,House.,22
Mr MALCOLM FRASER,Al l members of,22
NA,this House will be aware of the widespread con-,22
NA,demnation ofthe invasion of Afghanistan. There,22
NA,has been condemnation by 104 members of the,22
NA,United Nations. There has been a substantial,22
NA,condemnation from the Islamic Conference.,22
NA,Many other countries around the world individu-,22
NA,ally have demonstrated their abhorrence by the,22
NA,actions that they have taken. This has now been,22
NA,underlined by the unfolding of an effective boy-,22
NA,cott of the Olympic Games. I think that Aus-,22
NA,tralians would be concerned to find that the prin-,22
NA,"cipal Press officer of Mr Wilkes, the Leader of",22
NA,"the Labor Party in Victoria, has written in the",22
NA,Labor Star that one should rejoice that for once,22
NA,the Soviets are not acting in an objectively,22
NA,counter-revolutionary role as the Chinese seem,22
NA,always to act in these days. He pointed out that,22
NA,the Labor Party should be supporting both the,22
NA,of Afghan Government and the Soviet assistance to,22
NA,that Government.,22
Mr COHEN ,"Well , we are not.",22
Mr MALCOLM FRASER,I am just saying,22
NA,what Mr Wilkes's principal Press officer is,22
NA,saying.,22
Mr COHEN ,H e is an idiot.,22
Mr MALCOLM FRASER,I am glad of the,22
NA,honourable gentleman's confirmation that Mr,22
NA,Wilkes is employing an idiot. The letter goes on,22
NA,to indicate the great reforms that have been con-,23
NA,"ducted in Afghanistan since 1978, obviously ap-",23
NA,plauds the invasion and indicates that we should,23
NA,all be rejoicing in relation to it. That is a quite,23
NA,"extraordinary document in the Labor Star, but it",23
NA,is not out of line with what Senator Georges said,23
NA,in the Senate on 6 March this year. He stated:,23
NA,"With all its limitations, there is more dignity and",23
NA,in the Soviet Union than there is in our own society-,23
NA,On 8 March 1979 the honourable member for,23
NA,Hunter said:,23
NA,I do not apprehend any fear for Australia should,23
NA,Indonesia come under the influence of the Soviet Union.,23
NA,There is plainly a view within elements of the,23
NA,Australian Labor Party and particularly in the,23
NA,notorious socialist Left in Victoria-,23
NA,Honourable members interjecting-,23
Mr MALCOLM FRASER,I t is worth noting,23
NA,that Mr Hartley and the socialist Left in particu-,23
NA,lar have supported the Leader ofthe Opposition,23
NA,since the Leader of the Opposition repudiated,23
NA,Mr Hawke over economic and wages policies at,23
NA,the Adelaide conference last year. Mr Hawke,23
NA,indicated that it was a gutless sell-out to the Left.,23
NA,Since then there have been moves that will result,23
NA,in the socialist Left gaining greater influence in,23
NA,the Labor Party in Queensland where there are,23
NA,"now, in effect, two branches of the Labor Party.",23
NA,"With the lurch to the left, the willing captive of",23
NA,the Left-,23
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,23
Mr MALCOLM FRASER,The Labor Party,23
NA,might think that this is a matter of humour. It,23
NA,"may be a matter of humour to it, but it is also a",23
NA,matter of very deep concern to the wider Aus-,23
NA,tralian community. The fact that these matters,23
NA,are so evident within the Labor Party quite obvi-,23
NA,ously explains the antics of the Leader of the Op-,23
NA,position in recent days.,23
NA,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLIC E,23
Dr KLUGMAN,M y question is directed to,23
NA,the Minister for Administrative Services. In view,23
NA,of the debate to be held later today on the Auswhere,23
NA,"tralian Federal Police Amendment Bill 1980, I",23
NA,ask: How many officers carrying out law enforcethat,23
NA,ment functions were there in,23
NA,cotics Bureau before its dissolution because of,23
NA,"criticism by the royal commissioner into drugs,",23
NA,Mr Justice Williams? How many of these officers,23
NA,have applied to transfer to the Australian Fedrate,23
NA,eral Police? How many have been accepted by,23
NA,the Commissioner for the Australian Federal currently,23
NA,Police? How many have been rejected because of,23
NA,"alleged corruption, inefficiency and/or ance",23
NA,incompetence?,23
Mr JOHN MCLEAY, I thank the honourable,23
NA,gentleman for the question and I welcome him to,23
NA,the new front bench position to which he has,23
NA,been promoted. Two or three weeks ago I,23
NA,answered a similar question put to me by the,23
NA,Leader of the Opposition. I forget the exact,23
NA,"figures, but I think the number of special con-",23
NA,morality stables who transferred from the Narcotics Bu-,23
NA,reau is 84 and I think the other figure that the,23
NA,honourable member is seeking is 20 or 30,23
NA,officers. I will research the matter and supply the,23
NA,facts to him later today during the debate on the,23
NA,Australian Federal Police Amendment Bill.,23
NA,DEFENCE RESERVE PERSONNEL:,23
NA,COMPENSATION,23
Mr SHORT,I s the Minister representing the,23
NA,Minister for Social Security aware of the wide-,23
NA,spread public welcome to the Government's re-,23
NA,cent decision to increase the size of the Defence,23
NA,"Force reserves from 22,000 to 30,000? Is it a fact",23
NA,that under existing legislation Federal Govern-,23
NA,ment compensation to persons injured while,23
NA,serving in the reserves is limited to six months? Is,23
NA,it a fact that if a reservist wishes to be covered for,23
NA,compensation purposes beyond that period he is,23
NA,required to take out private insurance at his own,23
NA,cost? Does the Minister regard this situation as,23
NA,one discouraging young Australians from joining,23
NA,"the reserves? If so, will he take urgent action to",23
NA,have this situation examined with a view to,23
NA,extending the period for which compensation,23
NA,will be paid?,23
Mr HUNT, I am aware of the expansion of,23
NA,"the reserve forces, but I am not aware of the cir-",23
NA,cumstances to which the honourable gentleman,23
NA,"has referred. The position, as I know it, is that",23
NA,members of the Defence Force Reserve have a,23
NA,compensation facility under the Compensation,23
NA,(Commonwealth Government Employees) Act,23
NA,while participating in Defence Force Reserve,23
NA,"activities. As I understand it, if a member suffers",23
NA,"an injury in the course of any military service,",23
NA,compensation is payable for an unlimited period,23
NA,"in respect of incapacity for civil employment,",23
NA,such incapacity is supported by appropri-,23
NA,ate medical certificates. I am quite certain that,23
NA,is how the provisions of the Act apply to,23
NA,the Federal NarReserve servicemen.,23
NA,"For the first 26 weeks of incapacity, compen-",23
NA,sation is payable at the reservist's normal civilian,23
NA,of pay. If a reservist is incapacitated beyond,23
NA,"that period, weekly incapacity benefits are paid",23
NA,at $90 a week. He is also eligible for a,23
NA,spouse allowance of $23.60 a week and an allow-,23
NA,of $11.25 a week for each dependent child.,23
NA,Those rates of compensation are the same as are,23
NA,"payable for all Commonwealth employees, in-",24
NA,cluding regular members of the Defence Force,24
NA,"who sustain a work-connected injury. However, I",24
NA,will convey the honourable member's concern to,24
NA,the Minister and I have no doubt that she will,24
NA,in touch with him direct about the matter.,24
NA,COUNTRY TELEPHONE EXCHANGES,24
Mr FITZPATRICK ,Is the Minister for Post,24
NA,and Telecommunications aware that many,24
NA,country areas still have very poor telephone,24
NA,vices due to obsolete equipment in telephone,24
NA,exchanges? Can the Minister give a guarantee,24
NA,that there will be no slowing down of the,24
NA,program of replacement of this obsolete equip-,24
NA,ment while waiting for a connection to be made,24
NA,to the so-called national satellite communication,24
NA,system?,24
Mr STALEY,Without any doubt I can give,24
NA,such a guarantee. Some little while ago the,24
NA,Government agreed to Telecom Australia's,24
NA,spending an extra $30m in the current year on,24
NA,the conversion to automatic operation of those,24
NA,sorts of telephones to which the honourable,24
NA,member is referring. This accelerated program of counter-productive,24
NA,conversion to automatic of old manual teleadvantage,24
NA,phones will mean that by the,24
NA,nearly all Australians will have access,24
NA,"ern, automatic telephone service. It is far from",24
NA,the case that satellite developments are holding,24
NA,up those moves. The Government is accelerating would,24
NA,them at the same time.,24
NA,WOOL SALES TO THE SOVIET UNION,24
Mr OKEEFE ,Is the Minister for Trade and,24
NA,Resources aware of an allegation that he recently,24
NA,sought from the Soviet Union guarantees or as-,24
NA,surances that that country would continue to buy,24
NA,Australian wool? Is this allegation correct?,24
Mr ANTHONY,Ther e have been some alle-,24
NA,gations to this effect. In fact the honourable,24
NA,member for Corio made a number of statements,24
NA,in the House last night and on the Australian,24
NA,Broadcasting Commission radio program AM,24
NA,this morning which are factually incorrect.,24
NA,"ject those statements completely, both in sub-",24
NA,stance and in the spirit of the Government's pol-,24
NA,"icy towards the Soviet Union. Firstly, the",24
NA,honourable member suggested that Australian,24
NA,trade officials were called in by the Soviet,24
NA,Government and informed that wool sales would,24
NA,"be boycotted. As far as I am aware, Australian",24
NA,trade officials in Moscow have had discussions,24
NA,with the Soviet trade ministry officials on only,24
NA,one occasion since the Soviet invasion of,24
NA,Afghanistan. It was an informal meeting. The re-,24
NA,"port of that meeting indicates that no threat, or",24
NA,"indeed suggestion, was made that Australian",24
NA,wool sales would be boycotted. The honourable,24
NA,member for Corio suggested also that I had,24
NA,called in for discussions Soviet trade officials in,24
NA,get Australia. Let me make it very clear that since,24
NA,the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan I have not,24
NA,"called in any Soviet trade officials. In fact, I have",24
NA,had no contact with any member of the Soviet,24
NA,Embassy.,24
NA,The honourable member stated also that it is,24
NA,ser- fairly certain that the Australian Government,24
NA,sought undertakings or at least information from,24
NA,the Soviet Union as to its intention in relation to,24
NA,wool sales. On no occasion have I sought either,24
NA,undertakings or information regarding the,24
NA,Soviet Union's position on the purchase of Aus-,24
NA,tralian wool. These allegations are totally un-,24
NA,founded and I reject them without qualification.,24
NA,On the basis of these incorrect assertions the,24
NA,honourable member accused me of hypocrisy. I,24
NA,respond to that accusation simply by quoting two,24
NA,very short comments made by the Leader ofthe,24
NA,Opposition. On 19 February he said:,24
NA,"There is absolutely no point in empty gestures, or in",24
NA,"measures that damage Australia, or dis-",24
NA,"our national interest, more than they do the",24
NA,middle of the 1980s Soviet Union.,24
NA,to a modOn the same date he said:,24
NA,"I have said from the beginning that an effective boycott, or",24
NA,"the transfer of the Olympic Games away from Moscow,",24
NA,"have embarrassed the Soviet Union deeply, and could",24
NA,have been expected to drive home to many of her own,24
NA,people the point that the invasion of Afghanistan was re-,24
NA,pugnant to and rejected by most countries of the world.,24
NA,"If there is any hypocrisy, I invite the House to",24
NA,made a judgment as to where that hypocrisy lies.,24
NA,ETHNIC PRESS,24
Dr CASS,Ha s the attention of the Minister,24
NA,for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs been drawn,24
NA,to a question directed to his predecessor on 2,24
NA,"June 1978, in reply to which the previous Minis-",24
NA,ter promised to give consideration to the in-,24
NA,clusion of Opposition news releases in the pub-,24
NA,lication For the Ethnic Media which is produced,24
NA,I re- by the Minister's Department? As no further,24
NA,"word has been heard from the previous Minister,",24
NA,does this mean that after 18 months' consider-,24
NA,ation he was unable to make a decision? Was a,24
NA,decision made to ignore the question and the,24
NA,"Minister's promise, or is the matter still under",24
NA,consideration? Why has departmental editorial,24
NA,comment appeared in the 8 April issue of From,24
NA,"the Ethnic Press, a publication issued by the De-",24
NA,partment which purports to be a weekly selection,24
NA,of news and editorial opinion from Australia's,24
NA,foreign language Press? Does it mean that both,24
NA,"publications, posing as a service to the ethnic",24
NA,"communities, have now degenerated into ve-",25
NA,hicles for departmental propaganda?,25
Mr MACPHEE,In respect of the first part of,25
NA,"the honourable member's question, my attention",25
NA,has not previously been drawn to that matter. I,25
NA,will investigate it forthwith and speak to him,25
NA,later this afternoon. In respect ofthe second mat-,25
NA,"ter, my attention has been drawn to the editorial",25
NA,note. I believe that the action ofthe Deputy Sec-,25
NA,retary of the Department on this occasion was,25
NA,perfectly justified. I shall explain to the House,25
NA,"the reasons for it. In fact, the journal From the",25
NA,Ethnic Press is not an avenue of propaganda in,25
NA,respect of the Department. It is a service. It pro-,25
NA,vides summaries of what is published in all eth-,25
NA,nic Press. It is taken as being an accurate sum-,25
NA,mary. Sometimes the articles as summarised are,25
NA,themselves taken as being true and are therefore,25
NA,not questioned. On this occasion there was a ref-,25
NA,erence in La Fiamma which was in error in sev-,25
NA,eral respects. It happened that the same edition,25
NA,quoted the honourable member for Maribyr-,25
NA,nong. The decision facing the editor of From the,25
NA,Ethnic Press was: Should he omit the reference,25
NA,because it was in error and would be reproduced,25
NA,"in other journals without question, or should he",25
NA,include it and quote the honourable member's,25
NA,contribution but include an editorial note mak-,25
NA,ing it clear that the report was in error in,25
NA,spects? He chose to do the latter. It did not affect,25
NA,the contribution ofthe honourable member. I be-,25
NA,lieve that the editorial note was,25
NA,accuracy and was therefore in every way,25
NA,justified.,25

NA,member for Franklin will resume his seat. I indithis,25
NA,cate to the honourable gentleman that if he percruing,25
NA,sists in making comments as a preface to his,25
NA,question I will rule him out of order.,25
Mr GOODLUCK,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. people",25
NA,What Government initiated the,25
NA,CaUaghan inquiry into industries in Tasmania?,25
NA,What benefits are nowflowingto Tasmania as a,25
NA,result of the report of that inquiry? Have the,25
NA,"claims of the Premier of Tasmania, Mr Lowe,",25
NA,during the previous State election now been,25
NA,proved to be completely without foundation? In,25
NA,"fact, were they a con on the Tasmanian people?",25
Mr MALCOLM FRASER,The answer to,25
NA,the last part of the honourable gentleman's ques-,25
NA,tion is a plain and short yes. I think all honour-,25
NA,able gentlemen will know that the initiatives of,25
NA,"this Government, as a result of the CaUaghan re-",25
NA,"port and as a result of other measures, have very",25
NA,materially assisted Tasmania and industries in,25
NA,"Tasmania. As further evidence of this assistance,",25
NA,on 15 April of this year I announced the decision,25
NA,to establish a national marine science centre in,25
NA,"Tasmania, costing about $25m over a period, in-",25
NA,cluding $9m for a research vessel.,25
Mr YOUNG ,Di d that come out of the,25
NA,CaUaghan report?,25
Mr MALCOLM FRASER,"Yes, it is very",25
NA,much as a result of matters that the Government,25
NA,has pursued following the CaUaghan report,25
NA,"which, of course, this Government initiated. This",25
NA,will mean the moving of the relevant division of,25
NA,the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Re-,25
NA,search Organisation from Cronulla in New South,25
NA,Wales to Tasmania. It will lead to an enhanced,25
NA,national effort and very greatly assist in the im-,25
NA,plementation of the Government's broad poli-,25
NA,cies in relation to Tasmania. It needs to be noted,25
NA,that it follows the movement of the Antarctic,25
NA,Division of the Department of Science and the,25
NA,Environment and also the establishment of the,25
NA,some reAustralian Maritime College at Launceston.,25
NA,These are but some of the initiatives that this,25
NA,Government has pursued in relation to the,25
NA,in the interests of CaUaghan report.,25
NA,"I understand that Mr Lowe, speaking a short",25
NA,"while ago on television in Tasmania, tried to take",25
NA,all of the credit for these particular matters him-,25
NA,"self, ignoring completely the efforts of the",25
NA,"honourable gentleman who asked this question,",25
NA,"the honourable member for Franklin, and ignor-",25
NA,in particular the efforts of the honourable,25
NA,Prime member for Denison who has worked long and,25
NA,assiduously not only in relation to the Antarctic,25
NA,centre but also in relation to the movement of the,25
NA,division of the CSIRO. I am quite certain that all,25
NA,recognise the effect ofthe policies of,25
NA,Government and the advantages that are ac-,25
NA,to all of the people of Tasmania as a result,25
NA,of the policies of this Government. Mr Lowe,25
NA,would have to be much better than he is to make,25
NA,believe that he is responsible for these,25
NA,now famous particular matters.,25
NA,INVESTMENT ALLOWANCE,25
Mr HAYDEN,I refer the Acting Treasurer to,25
NA,a statement that was made by the Minister for In-,25
NA,"dustry and Commerce when he was Treasurer, in",25
NA,"January 1976, announcing details of the invest-",25
NA,"ment allowance, in which it was claimed that the",25
NA,allowance would be a strong encouragement for,26
NA,business to expand so as to become more efficient,26
NA,and more productive. Is it a fact that more than,26
NA,"$ 1,100m of tax revenue has been forgone",26
NA,through the operation of the investment allow-,26
NA,ance in the last four years? Did the annual rate of,26
NA,productivity increase in the economy from 1976,26
NA,"to 1979 average only 1.7 per cent, half the aver-",26
NA,age achieved during the Labor period of govern-,26
NA,ment? Why has the investment allowance failed,26
NA,so dismally to stimulate productivity?,26
Mr ERIC ROBINSON,I do recall a state-,26
NA,ment made by the Minister for Industry and,26
NA,Commerce when he was Treasurer regarding the,26
NA,investment allowance. The view that he ex-,26
NA,"pressed, that the investment allowance made a",26
NA,"very valuable contribution to Australia, is one",26
NA,that is shared by all members of the Govern-,26
NA,"ment. Indeed, it was a decision made in order",26
NA,that we could get some development and growth,26
NA,throughout the industrial section of the Aus-,26
NA,tralian community. Considerable benefits have,26
NA,"flowed from it in terms of reducing costs, increas-",26
NA,ing exports and increasing our capacity to com-,26
NA,"pete. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that,",26
NA,"when this Government was returned to office, the",26
NA,nation's ability to compete had been vastly,26
NA,eroded due to the fiscal policies which the pre-,26
NA,vious Administration had pursued.,26
NA,"On return, this Government took steps in a",26
NA,number of ways-reducin g Government expen-,26
NA,"diture, controlling the money supply and",26
NA,introducing the investment allowance-t o get,26
NA,"this nation competitive again. That, of course, is",26
NA,what has occurred. There have been some,26
NA,tremendous benefits. Had there been greater re-,26
NA,"straint in a number of other areas, particularly in",26
NA,"the wages area, and a greater degree of responsi-",26
NA,bility from the Labor Opposition with regard to,26
NA,industrial relations and had the Labor Oppo-,26
NA,sition discharged a national responsibility in,26
NA,ing the members of its trade unions to act more in,26
NA,"the national interest, we would have had greater",26
NA,productivity in this country. The investment al-,26
NA,lowance has played a very valuable role in,26
NA,increasing productivity and great credit is upon,26
NA,the Government for its implementation.,26
NA,ANTARCTI C TREATY HEADQUARTERS,26
Mr HODGMAN,Does the Prime Minister,26
NA,recall representations that I made to him and,26
NA,the Minister for Foreign Affairs over two years,26
NA,ago in support of my proposal that the interof,26
NA,national headquarters of the Antarctic Treaty,26
NA,"nations should be based at Kingston, Tasmania, offences.",26
NA,in close proximity to the new Australian Antarc-,26
NA,tic Division headquarters? Does the Govern-,26
NA,ment's decision last week to establish the $2 5m,26
NA,national marine science centre in Hobart con-,26
NA,siderably strengthen the case for the basing of,26
NA,"the international headquarters in Australia and,",26
NA,"more particularly, at Kingston, Tasmania?",26
Mr MALCOLM FRASER,I certainly be-,26
NA,lieve that the range of research facilities that we,26
NA,will have in Tasmania will strengthen Australia's,26
NA,case in the international community for gaining,26
NA,the international headquarters to which the,26
NA,honourable gentleman has referred. We are,26
NA,"pressing the Australian case, but there are others",26
NA,who hope that the headquarters will be in their,26
NA,"country. If the headquarters comes to Australia,",26
NA,Tasmania is the logical place for it to be. If that is,26
NA,the case it will owe much to the honourable,26
NA,gentleman's advocacy and the way in which the,26

Mr MORRIS,In the Australian of 18 April,27

NA,said last year the Minister,27
NA,Liberal council meeting in Perth the Government,27
NA,sidering selling TAA.,27
NA,The report goes on:,27
NA,Mr Robinson later denied having made the statement.,27
NA,The report is completely untrue. The Minister,27
NA,Finance ( Mr Eric Robinson) has refused to move,27
NA,away from his statement that the Government,27
NA,considering the sale of Trans-Australia Airlines.,27
NA,"The article inaccurately reports what I said,",27
NA,which is shown on page 1918 of Hansard. I said:,27
NA,The Minister then told the Federal Liberal Party Council,27
NA,meeting in Perth that the Government was considering the,27
NA,sale of TAA.,27
NA,The Treasurer ( Mr Howard) when challenged at the time,27
NA,in Newcastle to refute what the Minister for Finance had,27
NA,"said, refused to answer. He still stands in that position.",27

NA,AUSTRALIA'S RELATIONS WITH IRAN,27
NA,Ministerial Statement,27
NA,NA,27
NA,Foreign Affairs)-b y leave-M y colleague,27
NA,Minister for Trade and Resources ( Mr Anthony),27
NA,and I are jointly responsible for giving effect,27
NA,the decisions that I am about to announce relatwill,27
NA,ing to the detention of the American hostages in,27
NA,Tehran and the decisions we have taken on,27
NA,lations with Iran. The Government has made a,27
NA,further review of trade in non-food items with,27
NA,Iran and has considered a range of options open,27
NA,to it. It has been decided to prohibit further,27
NA,exports of Disappearing Automatic Retaliatory,27
NA,Target-DART-equipmen t to Iran until the taining,27
NA,hostages are released. The DART equipment is,27
NA,"the only item of military or quasi-military equipportance,",27
NA,ment now being exported to Iran from Australia.,27
NA,We have also decided to cease remaining,27
NA,assistance to trade in non-food items with Iran.,27
NA,The assistance which is now to cease will include,27
NA,export insurance cover on new business and,27
NA,export incentive arrangements in respect of non-,27
NA,food trade with Iran.,27
NA,I take this opportunity to draw the attention of,27
NA,Australian exporters to the increasingly un-,27
NA,favourable climate for trade with Iran. Our judg-,27
NA,ment is that the climate will continue to deterio-,27
NA,rate unless and until the hostages are released.,27
NA,Their continued detention is not only an affront,27
NA,to a fundamental principle of relations between,27
NA,"states, it is also a cruel and increasingly danger-",27
NA,ous affront to the American people in human,27
NA,terms.,27
NA,Innocent American citizens have been,27
NA,detained for nearly half a year. Whatever their,27
NA,"physical condition, there can be no doubt regard-",27
NA,"Tor Finance, Mr Robinson, told a",27
NA,was coning the mental strains and anguish they are,27
NA,suffering. Neither can there be any doubt about,27
NA,the strength of feeling among their fellow coun-,27
NA,trymen concerning their condition and safety. In,27
NA,the circumstances the United States has shown,27
NA,for remarkable forebearance. It has walked the path,27
NA,"of negotiation with patience, in the face of",27
NA,is considerable provocation and repeated dis-,27
NA,appointment. To assume that its forebearance is,27
NA,unlimited or to equate it with indifferent or weak-,27
NA,ness would be a grave mistake. A great democ-,27
NA,racy cannot be expected to wait indefinitely,27
NA,while revolutionary factions resolve their,27
NA,differences-wit h the lives of its citizens being,27
NA,used as pawns.,27
NA,In taking these further decisions that I have,27
NA,"So we announced, the Government's objective is to",27
NA,"register with the Iranian authorities, in the",27
NA,"clearest possible terms, its repugnance at Iran's",27
NA,behaviour in using hostages as a political device,27
NA,and its concern about the danger to peace which,27
NA,flows from that behaviour. Attempting to humili-,27
NA,test the limits of the patience of a great,27
NA,the power is an extremely dangerous game. The,27
NA,Government's firm view is that only concerted,27
NA,to action by the United States' friends and allies,27
NA,bring home to the Iranian authorities that,27
NA,their handling of the hostages issue is totally un-,27
NA,reacceptable to the international community.,27
NA,The United States is moving in a deliberate,27
NA,and considered way to make clear to Iran the,27
NA,costs of persisting in detaining the hostages. The,27
NA,justice of its case; the common interest in main-,27
NA,the principle of diplomatic immunity; the,27
NA,"responsibility of alliance; and, of overriding im-",27
NA,the need to remove a danger to world,27
NA,peace-al l these considerations justify firm sup-,27
NA,official port from America's allies.,27
NA,The Government's concern has been re-,27
NA,inforced by the consultations last week of the,27
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) with,28
NA,Commonwealth and other leaders in Salisbury,28
NA,during the Zimbabwe independence cel-,28
NA,ebrations. So long as there is no movement in the,28
NA,"situation, other measures open to the Govern-",28
NA,ment will be kept under close and constant re-,28
NA,view. But the hope of the Government is that,28
NA,"there will be movement, and that this irrational",28
NA,and callous behaviour will cease forthwith.,28
Mr HAYDEN ,Oxley-Leader of the,28
NA,Opposition)-b y leave-Th e statement of the,28
NA,NA,28
NA,described as a low level response to an extremely,28
NA,difficult and potentially extremely dangerous,28
NA,situation-on e that could imply great difficulties,28
NA,"for the rest of the world. In fact, I think that one",28
NA,could fairly go beyond stating that it was a low,28
NA,level response and say that it was a rather limp,28
NA,reaction from a government that displayed so,28
NA,much fury so recently on another international,28
NA,situation not far removed geographically from,28
NA,Iran. What it boils down to is a fairly clear dem-,28
NA,"onstration that once again, when it comes to",28
NA,"competitive interests, on the one hand, on the",28
NA,"part of farm exports and, on the other hand, in-",28
NA,"ternational relations, the Nauonal Country Party",28
NA,wins hands down in every such situation.,28
NA,Let us look at the potential that Australia,28
NA,to apply influence on Iran. Australia has develsee,28
NA,"oped a substantial trade with Iran, and a trade",28
NA,with a considerable growth rate. Our exports for,28
NA,the first six months of the currentfinancialyear,28
NA,amounted to $120m compared with $116m for bassy,28
NA,the whole of 1978-79. So the rate of growth,28
NA,exports this year is twice that which applied,28
NA,"1978-79. More significantly, of that total amount",28
NA,"of exports-tha t is, of the $ 120m-onl y about",28
NA,$9m was not accounted for by farm products.,28
NA,Meat and live sheep accounted for $50m and,28
NA,wheat for $44m. They were the dominant items.,28
NA,That is significant because the inspired leaks,28
NA,from unidentified but official sources which contributes,28
NA,appeared prominently in the newspapers this,28
NA,morning left the community with the impression,28
NA,that this was a massive retribution by Australia,28
NA,against Iran in support of our,28
NA,"the sort. More than that, once again, the",28
NA,National Country Party has extracted as the,28
NA,price of its partnership in the coalition complete,28
NA,immunity for the products in which their conunease,28
NA,stituency is directly involved.,28
NA,But let me go on. I want to make it clear that,28
NA,we sympathise with the United States and its,28
NA,"leaders in this dilemma. For six months, 50 cititrated.",28
NA,zens of the United States who are entitled to,28
NA,full protection of international law and practice,28
NA,covering diplomatic representation have been tary,28
NA,"prisoners. For six months, the immunity of the",28
NA,official United States Embassy and its contents,28
NA,has been persistently and scornfully breached.,28
NA,The most shameful feature of the situation in,28
NA,Tehran is the studied refusal of any recognised,28
NA,authority to take responsibility for what has been,28
NA,going on. That is what President Carter is seek-,28
NA,ing to do now-t o create a situation whereby re-,28
NA,sponsibility has to be shouldered at official level,28
NA,so that at least there is a defined party for,28
NA,negotiation.,28
NA,The great fear must be that there is no level of,28
NA,authority both willing and able to accept the re-,28
NA,sponsibility. There is strong ground now for the,28
NA,belief that nobody in Iran is able to exercise,28
NA,effective control. We see in that country a presi-,28
NA,dent elected by an impressive majority with the,28
NA,"support of the religious parties, taking moderate",28
NA,positions and saying the right sorts of things-,28
NA,"indisputably an intelligent and able man, but un-",28
NA,able to take effective action. We see as the re-,28
NA,ligious head of state a tired and sick old man,28
NA,whose grasp of the day-to-day realities of inter-,28
NA,national developments appears suspect and who,28
NA,is more inclined to react than to lead. We see a,28
NA,revolutionary council of a dozen or so other,28
NA,"figures, mostly little known and understood less,",28
NA,who are given to making ringing declarations,28
NA,has from a basis of dubious authority. Soon we will,28
NA,an elected parliament whose outlook and real -,28
NA,authority are problematical at this stage.,28
NA,The students occupying the American Em-,28
NA,and holding the hostages see themselves as,28
NA,in both a political and a religious force. We now,28
NA,in have contending student groups rampaging,28
NA,through the universities-on e faction at least be-,28
NA,"lieving it does so with the blessing, or at the be-",28
NA,"hest, of its religious leaders. A huge refugee",28
NA,problem continues to grow on the border with,28
NA,Iraq where military exchanges of varying sig-,28
NA,nificance have also been taking place. All of this,28
NA,to a picture of instability and ineffec-,28
NA,tive control and leadership on a frightening,28
NA,scale. Forces are at work which could rip Iran,28
NA,apart with a level of bloodshed we hesitate to,28
NA,ally. It is nothing of contemplate.,28
NA,"At the same time, our sympathy for the",28
NA,American position is tinged with considerable,28
NA,on several scores. The overriding one,28
NA,arises from the feeling that the situation has de-,28
NA,veloped an inexorable momentum of its own and,28
NA,that the direction is towards a form of military,28
NA,action. The American people are angry and frus-,28
NA,They are demanding action. According to,28
NA,the a Washington Post poll published yesterday as,28
NA,many as two-thirds of Americans support a mili-,28
NA,course of action-unspecifie d though it is. In,28
NA,the United States at present the most sensitive,29
NA,decision-making with the most profound impli-,29
NA,cations for the whole world is proceeding in the,29
NA,worst possible environment. The process is,29
NA,taking place in the full heat of the primary polls,29
NA,leading up to the American presidential election,29
NA,at the end of this year. The one certainty in,29
NA,daunting in the extreme. It is that no President of,29
NA,the United States can seek re-election in just a,29
NA,few months time while 50 American diplomatic,29
NA,personnel remain hostage in Tehran. But the,29
NA,time fuse is even shorter than that. No American,29
NA,President can continue through the shoals and,29
NA,shallows of the primaries campaign for much,29
NA,longer without taking some decisive action in this,29
NA,situation. The dilemma is that the diplomatic in-,29
NA,itiatives are virtually exhausted already and that,29
NA,we are very close to the point where only military,29
NA,options are left.,29
NA,The potential consequences of military action,29
NA,are such that I believe we should avoid public,29
NA,"speculation upon them at this stage. However,",29
NA,we cannot overlook the fact that the Soviet lations.,29
NA,Union shares an uneasy border with Iran and,29
NA,maintains significant military forces in the area.,29
NA,"In my assessment, Iran's oil does not even enter",29
NA,the immediate calculation of possible Russian,29
NA,"action. But border instability, with its effect",29
NA,"Soviet Muslims in the region, could do so. Iran",29
NA,poised to become aflashpointcomparable with,29
NA,that provided by the Balkans in earlier times.,29
NA,Iran the spheres of interest of the two super-,29
NA,powers are dangerously close to overlapping.,29
NA,Almost 30 years ago a major misjudgment by,29
NA,the Central Intelligence Agency led to the,29
NA,throw of the elected Mossadegh government in,29
NA,"Tehran and the installation of the Shah, with",29
NA,the instruments of oppression and authoriforces,29
NA,tarianism that are now so well documented. That,29
NA,memory in Iran reacts powerfully against the,29
NA,United States in that country today. We cannot,29
NA,afford another such misjudgment. The Shah's,29
NA,regime brought a significant measure of econstrate,29
NA,omic development to Iran. Of that there is no,29
NA,"doubt, but it did so with vast inequities between",29
NA,"the people, with the unconscionable use of torbound",29
NA,"ture and uncontrolled secret police activities,",29
NA,"through Savak, against a background of corruplesson",29
NA,"tion, coercion and gross violation of human",29
NA,rights.,29
NA,It is difficult to call that sort of development,29
NA,progress. It should emphasise to us at once and,29
NA,do so once again the need to look at the world,29
NA,alistically and to defend basic principles Union,29
NA,consistently-tw o measures that we have been,29
NA,constantly urging on the Government. We must,29
NA,not prop up dictators and despots uncritically,29
NA,simply because some of their attitudes suit us in,29
NA,realpolitik terms. We must not bend to the,29
NA,"wishes, for example, of a friendly but unques-",29
NA,tionably authoritarian and cruel government in,29
NA,"Saudi Arabia, one which would prefer to main-",29
NA,tain a more benign image with Australian,29
NA,this is television audiences. We should not condemn,29
NA,ruthless military repression and invasion in,29
NA,Afghanistan but ignore or excuse it in East,29
NA,Timor. We should recognise that one of the legit-,29
NA,imate purposes of providing aid is to further the,29
NA,values and principles in which we believe. We,29
NA,should make the judgment of that purpose a con-,29
NA,"stant factor in our aid programs, which should be",29
NA,"expanded in scope and quality, not contracted",29
NA,"consistently, as we have seen happen since 1975.",29
NA,The Middle East has long been regarded as a,29
NA,potential powder keg and its likelyflashpointis,29
NA,much closer now than it has been for a long time.,29
NA,"It is a rather unanticipated paradox that, con-",29
NA,"trary to the general assumption, thatflashpointis",29
NA,not necessarily contained in Arab-Israeli re-,29
NA,It was assumed that an Arab-Israeli clash,29
NA,would drag the superpowers into confrontation.,29
NA,The likelihood of that clash taking place has,29
NA,"been considerably eased in recent times. Now,",29
NA,"however, the chaotic situation in Iran has created",29
NA,on circumstances in which a series of events could,29
NA,"is be set off, leading to a point at which the super-",29
NA,powers will stumble into conflict through actions,29
NA,In and reactions that they would prefer to avoid.,29
NA,"Aside from that rather drastic scenario, the im-",29
NA,plications of a tough United States military re-,29
NA,oversponse to the hostage situation are dramatic,29
NA,enough even at a more restricted regional level.,29
NA,all That could be the action which turns loose the,29
NA,"of Islamic fundamentalism, radicalism",29
NA,"and restrictive reformism, which have been fer-",29
NA,menting in many such countries throughout the,29
NA,region for some time-i n some cases for gener-,29
NA,ations. Some of these countries seem to demon-,29
NA,the fact that the West appears determined,29
NA,not to learn from the lessons of recent history.,29
NA,They are countries in which the governments are,29
NA,"to fall in the end because of their tyranny,",29
NA,their ineptness and their inequity. The principal,29
NA,is that we should not prop up such govern-,29
NA,ments. We should support administrations that,29
NA,"will survive because they deserve to, for what",29
NA,they achieve on behalf of their people.,29
NA,"Equally, it is time that we took a realistic view",29
NA,reof the successes and capabilities of the Soviet,29
NA,in international affairs. Of course the Rus-,29
NA,sians will do everything that they can to exploit,29
NA,weakness within the Western sphere of influence,29
NA,wherever they find the opportunity. But we,29
NA,should abandon the Western propensity to exag-,30
NA,gerate Soviet successes. The Russians do not,30
NA,walk on water and we ought not to presume they,30
NA,"do, or convey the impression that we suspect that",30
NA,they do. In recent years they have been thrown,30
NA,out of countries such as Egypt and Somalia. They,30
NA,have not maintained their influence in places,30
NA,"such as Angola. The communist monolith, com-",30
NA,"prising Russia and China, crumbled while Wes-",30
NA,tern observers were still forecasting its dire,30
NA,consequences.,30
NA,Let me refer quickly to some of the dimensions,30
NA,ofthe propensity available for military instability,30
NA,"in the Middle East. Professor Amos Perimutter,",30
NA,in an arucle in the Asian Wall Street Journal of,30
NA,"20 March, stated:",30
NA,According to the International Institute for Strategic,30
NA,"studies' report 'The Military Balance, 1979-1980', there are",30
NA,"today 66 divisions in this military and political theatre, a",30
NA,jump of 60 per cent from ten years ago. The number of tanks,30
NA,"has risen to 15,850, a jump of 66 per cent and the number of",30
NA,planes of varying qualities and capabilities has risen to,30
NA,"3,066, an increase of 61.1 per cent.",30
NA,The seriousness and magnitude of this military arsenal,30
NA,be quickly perceived by comparing it to NATO. According to,30
NA,"the IISS report, NATO fields 75 divisions, only nine more",30
NA,"than those present in the Middle East, has 16,025 tanks,",30
NA,175 more than now in the Middle,30
NA,"sists of a combined strength of2,450 planes, 616 fewer than",30
NA,now operating in the Middle East.,30
NA,Those statistics illustrate dramatically and dis-,30
NA,"turbingly the enormous propensity, not just for Opposition",30
NA,instability but for massive conflict as a conseing,30
NA,"quence of that instability. Furthermore, that sort",30
NA,"of conflict, should it arise through inadroit Minister",30
NA,measures at some stage of the very delicate and,30
NA,difficult situation which is being negotiated by the,30
NA,"the Americans, could have ramifications that",30
NA,would spread well beyond the Middle East and,30
NA,"could, indeed, inject into the rest of the",30
NA,challenges as to whether peace will be preserved,30
NA,or not.,30
NA,"In all the circumstances,",30
NA,nounced by the Foreign Minister is extremely,30
NA,"limited. In the case of Afghanistan, the Govern-",30
NA,ment was prepared to expend enormous energy osition.,30
NA,and prestige to achieve a result that it felt was,30
NA,warranted in regard to the Olympic Games. Both,30
NA,the rhetoric and the level of activity in that,30
NA,stand in stark contrast to the response that,30
NA,"been announced today. In fact, the Opposition",30
NA,does see a need for caution and temperance in,30
NA,"this situation, but it cannot allow",30
NA,to pass-,30
NA,NA,30
Mr HAYDEN,T o draw attention rather far,30
NA,wryly to the different standards o f -,30
NA,NA,30
Mr SPEAKER,The Minister will refrain,30
NA,from interjecting.,30
Mr HAYDEN,Response s by the Govern-,30
NA,ment to the situation in Afghanistan and the,30
NA,"problem in Iran. Curiously, the Government",30
NA,"pointed out, in the statement of the Prime Minis-",30
NA,ter ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) to the House on 19,30
NA,"February, the dangers, in the case of Afghanis-",30
NA,"tan, of painting an adversary into too tight a",30
NA,corner. That applies with equal force in this situ-,30
NA,ation. Does the Minister for Foreign Affairs dis-,30
NA,agree? Not at all. Excessive pressure could,30
NA,"merely harden positions. Nevertheless, it is re-",30
NA,grettable that the Government's decision will be,30
NA,seen for what it principally is- a straight-out,30
NA,exertion of political muscle by the National,30
NA,Country Party side of the coalition. The with-,30
NA,drawal of Government export support in the case,30
NA,of Iran is a slight enough reaction; but it is not,30
NA,even extended to the farm products which are,30
NA,the real basis for argument by the National,30
NA,"Country Party. The Iranian situation, with all",30
NA,can that could flow from it in that vastly troubled re-,30
NA,"gion of the world, is a far greater danger to world",30
NA,"peace in the current climate than is Afghanistan,",30
NA,only about which this Government has made such ex-,30
NA,"East, and its air force con-",30
NA,"travagant claims, and the Minister knows that.",30
NA,Does he dispute it? His silence is resounding.,30
Mr SPEAKER,I indicate to the Leader ofthe,30
NA,"that, when the Minister was interject-",30
NA,"previously, I asked the Minister to remain",30
NA,silent. If the Leader of the Opposition invites the,30
NA,"to interject, I will not be able to prevent",30
NA,Minister doing so. I suggest that the Leader,30
NA,of the Opposition does not do that.,30
Mr HAYDEN, I have no objection to the,30
NA,world Minister's responding to that question.,30
Mr SPEAKER, I ask the honourable gentle-,30
NA,man to make his speech and not to invite,30
NA,"then, the response aninterjections.",30
Mr HAYDEN,Let me restate the prop-,30
NA,"The Iranian situation, with all that could",30
NA,flow from it in that vastly troubled region of the,30
NA,"world, is a far greater danger to world peace in",30
NA,case the current climate than the Afghanistan situ-,30
NA,"has ation, about which this Government has made",30
NA,such extravagant claims. I do not mind at all if,30
NA,the Minister cares to respond to show whether he,30
NA,the opportunity disputes that point.,30
NA,NA,30
Mr HAYDEN,The Prime Minister would be,30
NA,closer to the objective truth to talk of the,30
NA,possibility of World War III in relation to Iran,30
NA,rather than in relation to Afghanistan. One,30
NA,would never judge that from the cursory state-,31
NA,ment presented by the Foreign Minister today.,31
NA,NA,31
NA,Foreign Affairs)- I seek leave to make a,31
NA,statement.,31
Mr SPEAKER,I s leave granted?,31
NA,NA,31
Mr SPEAKER,Leave is granted.,31
NA,NA,31
NA,today was a measured statement. It followed the,31
NA,statement which was issued last week and which,31
NA,indicated that we would not replace our Am-,31
NA,"bassador, that we would withdraw our Trade",31
NA,Commissioner and that we were prepared to,31
NA,take additional measures. We have continued on,31
NA,that path. After constantly reviewing the situ-,31
NA,"ation and seeing no further movement, and fol-",31
NA,lowing further measures that were announced by,31
NA,"President Carter late last week, we have an-",31
NA,"nounced some further measures. Therefore,",31
NA,these have to be taken into consideration with,31
NA,our statement last week and the strong condem-,31
NA,nation of what is transpiring in Iran. I have made,31
NA,it perfectly clear that we will be keeping the mat-,31
NA,ter under consideration. Salient to that is that we,31
NA,"are prepared, if there is no further movement on",31
NA,"the question, to carry the matter further and in",31
NA,fact to do more.,31
NA,I listened very carefully to the remarks of,31
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Hayden). I have,31
NA,say this: At not one stage was a program perhaps,31
NA,"indicated, a policy proffered or a viewpoint",31
NA,"indicated as to what the Labor Party in governWriedt,",31
NA,ment would do. There were some selected,31
NA,readings-the y could well have come from some,31
NA,of my speeches-warnin g of concerns in different,31
NA,"parts of the world. Let me remind the House,",31
NA,"therefore, what the Labor Party policy is,",31
NA,cause this is of critical importance. Before I,31
NA,will also remind honourable members of my,31
NA,answer yesterday in the House to a question,31
NA,without notice from the right honourable,31
NA,member for Lowe ( Sir William MCMahon).,31
Mr JAMES ,Withou t notice?,31
NA,NA,31
NA,right honourable member for Lowe asked me,31
NA,about the dangerous conditions in the inter-,31
NA,"national scene, referred to the statement by",31
NA,"Chancellor Schmidt and asked for my reaction,",31
NA,which was well reported. 1 indicated that a grievsaid,31
NA,ous situation was ahead of us and that it could,31
NA,well be advisable for the superpowers to be talkment.,31
NA,"ing. So, in many ways much of what the Leader",31
NA,of the Opposition has said today complements,31
NA,the answer that I gave yesterday. But of critical,31
NA,and fundamental importance is that there was,31
NA,not one cubit of evidence given as to Labor Party,31
NA,"policy on this issue. Therefore, I will give it as it",31
NA,has been enunciated by its duly appointed,31
NA,"spokesman, the Leader of the Opposition in the",31
NA,"Senate, Senator Wriedt, who speaks for the Aus-",31
NA,tralian Labor Party on foreign policy. The Aus-,31
NA,"tralian Labor Party's policy on Iran is, firstly,",31
NA,that it would not have withdrawn the,31
NA,Ambassador.,31
Mr JAMES ,No .,31
NA,NA,31
NA,Does the honourable member agree with that?,31
Mr JAMES , I do.,31
NA,NA,31
NA,Revolutionary Council has said that it disagrees,31
NA,with any country which will withdraw its am-,31
NA,bassador. The second point is that we withdrew,31
NA,our Trade Commissioner and have been con-,31
NA,demned for doing so by the Australian Labor,31
NA,Party. Will you condemn it again today?,31
Mr SPEAKER,Order! I suggest that the,31
NA,Minister address his questions through the Chair,31
NA,and not direcdy to an honourable member,31
NA,opposite.,31
NA,NA,31
NA,Labor Party's attitude is the same as that of Iran.,31
NA,"Then, interestingly enough, the Leader of the",31
NA,the Opposition said that we had not moved on to the,31
NA,to question of trade in food and has implied that,31
NA,"he would take this significant measure,",31
NA,when we know from the statements of Senator,31
NA,"which were put on the record on 9 April,",31
NA,that the Australian Labor Party is opposed to,31
NA,any diplomatic or economic sanctions against,31
NA,"Iran. So, once again, the policy of the Australian",31
NA,Labor Party on the question of economic sanc-,31
NA,"betions is the same as that advocated by Iran,",31
NA,"do, I namely, that no one should respond to the re-",31
NA,"quests of the United States Government. So,",31
NA,"whether it be on the question of the Ambassador,",31
NA,the question of the Trade Commissioner or the,31
NA,"question of economic sanctions, the Labor",31
NA,Party's policy bluntly and succinctly mirrors the,31
NA,demands of the Iranian Revolutionary Council.,31
NA,leaves it sitting there in abject disgrace.,31
NA,The final point of reckoning is that at the end,31
NA,of the statement by Senator Wriedt which set out,31
NA,the policy of the Australian Labor Party it was,31
NA,that the determination of the question of the,31
NA,hostages ought to be made by the Iranian Parlia-,31
NA,The fact is that we do not even know when,31
NA,that Parliament will meet or what decision it will,31
NA,reach. That again is the policy of the Iranian,31
NA,"Revolutionary Council. So, on each of these",31
NA,"points, the policy enunciated-th e only time a",32
NA,policy for the Labor Pany in regard to the,32
NA,United States hostages has been enunciated-ha s,32
NA,"been a mirror image reflection, if we like, of what",32
NA,has been proffered by the Iranian Revolutionary,32
NA,Council. I put that here in the House and it has,32
NA,not been denied in the statement by the Leader,32
NA,ofthe Opposition today.,32
NA,We do not run away from the fact that we are,32
NA,giving the United States strong support. We do,32
NA,not run away from the fact that we see the inter-,32
NA,national climate as dangerous. I refer again to,32
NA,the answer I gave yesterday to therighthonour-,32
NA,able member for Lowe. Today's statement was,32
NA,made because I did not want simply to issue it,32
NA,yesterday outside the Parliament. It is to be read,32
NA,in conjunction with the other statements which,32
NA,have been made on this issue and which indicate,32
NA,that the Australian Government firmly supports,32
NA,the United States in its endeavours. We have yet,32
NA,to hear anything akin to that from the Labor,32
NA,"Party. Indeed, we have heard the antithesis of it.",32
Mr HAYDEN , I seek leave to make a short,32
NA,statement.,32
NA,NA,32
Mr HAYDEN ,"Com e off it! Aw, come off it!",32
NA,NA,32
Mr HAYDEN ,Oh ! What a cowardly scuttling,32
NA,from the front line.,32
NA,NA,32
Mr HAYDEN ,W e watched him angrily twitch-,32
NA,ing like a head waiter at Sorrentos who had not,32
NA,received the tip he expected.,32
NA,NA,32
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The Minister will re-,32
NA,main silent. The Leader of the Opposition will,32
NA,resume his seat.,32
Mr HAYDEN ," Mr Speaker, with your",32
NA,indulgence-,32
Mr SPEAKER,The honourable gentleman,32
NA,will resume his seat. The Leader of the Oppo-,32
NA,sition asked leave to make a statement. Leave,32
NA,"was refused. The Standing Orders, therefore, do",32
NA,not permit him to speak.,32
Mr HAYDEN ," Mr Speaker, can I speak with",32
NA,your indulgence?,32
Mr SPEAKER, I will not grant an indulgence,32
NA,when the House has denied leave. I call the Min-,32
NA,ister for Foreign Affairs.,32
Mr HAYDEN , I have to complain about the,32
NA,unexpected-,32
Mr SPEAKER,I will not hear the Leader of,32
NA,the Opposition. He has no call.,32

NA,an interjection.,32
Mr SPEAKER,Order!,32
Mr HAYDEN ,"Le t me put it in context, then I",32
NA,will sit down. I will be brief.,32
Mr SPEAKER,The honourable gentleman,32
NA,will resume his seat.,32
Mr HAYDEN ,No . Can I make this point?,32
Mr SPEAKER,The honourable gentleman,32
NA,will resume his seat. The rules of the Parliament,32
NA,are quite clear. The Leader of the Opposition can,32
NA,ask leave to make a statement. If it is refused by,32
NA,"any single voice, he does not have leave. I will",32
NA,not grant an indulgence to speak when the House,32
NA,has declined leave.,32
Mr HAYDEN ," Mr Speaker, can I raise a point",32
NA,with you about the deception in this?,32
Mr SPEAKER,No. The honourable gentle-,32
NA,man has no call and has no right to speak. I ask,32
NA,him to resume his seat.,32
Mr HAYDEN , I ask to make a point to you by,32
NA,indulgence so that the record is clear as to what,32
NA,has happened. It will take about three sentences.,32
Mr SPEAKER, I will permit three sentences,32
NA,and no more.,32
Mr HAYDEN ,Th e Minister asked leave to,32
NA,make a statement. He is scheduled to make two,32
NA,statements. I presumed he was making that state-,32
NA,ment. He was invited to respond to an interjec-,32
NA,tion. The Minister may gesture. He can read and,32
NA,he is not completely stupid. He was invited in the,32
NA,course of what I was saying to respond by way of,32
NA,"interjection. He did not, nor did he in the course",32
NA,of what he had to say. His behaviour is that of a,32
NA,posturing poltroon and this is not the first time,32
NA,we have seen it in the House.,32

Mr SCHOLES," Mr Speaker, in answer to a",33
NA,question during Question Time the Minister for,33
NA,"Trade and Resources ( Mr Anthony) said, among",33
NA,"other things, that 1 had used inaccurate infor-",33
NA,mation when I indicated that a threat had been,33
NA,made or was reported to the Government some,33
NA,time ago on a possible Russian boycott of,33
NA,tralian wool sales. An article which appeared,33
NA,the Australian Financial Review of 5 February,33
NA,1980 states:,33
NA,The Federal Government has been told that the Soviet,33
NA,Union is considering retaliatory action against Australia,33
NA,that a boycott of the wool auctions is one of the,33
NA,that has been proposed.,33
NA,"A spokesman for the Acting Prime Minister, Mr Anthony,",33
NA,yesterday confirmed a report that an official in the Depart-,33
NA,ment of Trade and Resources had been told by Australian,33
NA,trading interests of a meeting of Soviet officials in,33
NA,last week to discuss retaliatory measures.,33
NA,Clearly that report indicates that not.only did,33
NA,Deputy Prime Minister know that such threats,33
NA,had been made but also that his office had conare,33
NA,firmed to the Press that such reports had been,33
NA,"made. His statement was quite incorrect, as were",33

NA,WORKS,33
NA,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,33
NA,Discussion of Matter of Public Importance,33
Mr SPEAKER, I have received letters from,33
NA,the honourable members for Cunningham ( Mr,33
NA,"West), Diamond Valley ( Mr N. A. Brown) and",33
NA,Denison ( Mr Hodgman) proposing that definite,33
NA,Cox Peninmatters of public importance be submitted to the,33
NA,House for discussion today. As required by,33
NA,"Standing Order 107, I have selected the matter",33
NA,which in my opinion is the most urgent and im-,33
NA,"portant, that is that proposed by the honourable",33
NA,"I seek member for Cunningham, namely:",33
NA,The urgent need for the use of Commonwealth powers to,33
NA,deteriorating relations between the Kimberley,33
NA,Aborigines and mining companies and the Western,33
NA,Australian Government.,33
NA,I call upon those members who approve of the,33
NA,proposed discussion to rise in their places.,33
NA,More than the number of members required by,33
NA,the Standing Orders having risen in their places-,33
Mr WEST ,Cunningham) (3.50)-In Western,33
NA,AustraUa over the last few months there has been,33
NA,"a deterioration in relations between the 8,000",33
NA,"AusKimberley Aborigines, the Western AustraUan",33
NA,"in State Government, Amax Petroleum Co. and",33
NA,other mining companies. There is a fundamental,33
NA,"conflict between a 30,000-year old culture-th e",33
NA,culture of Aborigines-an d those who are,33
NA,and interested in seeing the progress of the second,33
NA,measures great post-war mining development that is oc-,33
NA,curring in Western Australia. Similar develop-,33
NA,ment will possibly occur in the Northern Terri-,33
NA,"tory and Queensland in coal projects, aluminium",33
NA,Moscow projects and so on. There are those in conserva-,33
NA,"tive State governments, mining companies, the",33
NA,the Federal Government and certainly the Depart-,33
NA,ment of National Development and Energy who,33
NA,determined to call a halt to the gains made by,33
NA,"Australia's original inhabitants, the Australian",33
NA,"Aborigines, in the area of land rights and to re-",33
NA,verse the gains that have been made by these,33
NA,people in the last few years. Perhaps the prime,33
NA,example of this is at a far away pastoral lease in,33
NA,Western AustraUa called Noonkanbah. This,33
NA,"station covers 4,700 square kilometres and was",33
NA,by the Aboriginal Land Fund Com-,33
NA,for the traditional local Aborigines in,33
NA,1975. It is now home to 200 or 300 Aboriginal,33
NA,people who recently were fringe dwellers in the,34
NA,Fitzroy Crossing area.,34
NA,The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr,34
NA,Dawkins) and I have twice visited this area in the,34
NA,last three weeks -on 2 April and 19 April. I ask,34
NA,the House to note that despite the intransigence,34
NA,of the Court Government in Western Australia,34
NA,and the professed interest of the Minister for,34
NA,Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Chaney) in the,34
NA,"Senate, neither of those people have visited the",34
NA,area even once during this time of confrontation.,34
NA,Noonkanbah includes a large area of Aboriginal,34
NA,sacred sites within a wide radius of the Pea Hill,34
NA,area. Sacred sites in Western Australia are sup-,34
NA,posed to be protected under the Western,34
NA,Australian Aboriginal Heritage Act which was,34
NA,introduced by a State Labor government in,34
NA,1972. Under the provisions of the Act the,34
NA,trustees of the Western Australian Museum have,34
NA,the power to investigate and declare Aboriginal,34
NA,sacred sites. The Minister for Cultural Affairs has,34
NA,the power to override the Museum definitions.,34
NA,"In June 1979, after an extensive survey, the",34
NA,Western Australian Museum compiled a report,34
NA,on the Pea Hill sacred site leases which favoured,34
NA,the Aborigines. Amax Petroleum holds explo-,34
NA,ration leases over much of the Pea Hill area. In,34
NA,October 1978 the approximate location for a,34
NA,drilling site was shown to the Museum by Amax,34
NA,Petroleum. Subsequently the Museum's defini-,34
NA,tion of the sacred sites was rejected by the State,34
NA,"Minister for Cultural Affairs, who gave no reason",34
NA,whatsoever. The Minister accepted that it was,34
NA,time that Amax Petroleum drilled in that area.,34
NA,This decision was in accord with the decisions of,34
NA,the Western Australian Government not to grant,34
NA,pastoral leases at all to Aborigines. Indeed none,34
NA,have been transferred since 1977. Attempts by,34
NA,the Land Fund Commission to acquire further,34
NA,pastoral leases in Western Australia have met,34
NA,with a negative response from the Court,34
NA,Government. The Gordon Downs station was,34
NA,"applied for. This station, which is in the east",34
NA,"Kimberleys, is presently owned by Vesteys. The",34
NA,decision to transfer this lease was opposed by Mr,34
NA,"Wordsworth, the Western Australian Lands",34
NA,Minister. He gave no reason except that he,34
NA,wanted to try to incorporate vacant Crown land,34
NA,"in the area into a viable station. The real reason,",34
NA,"of course, was simply that he did not want to see",34
NA,Aborigines acquire any further pastoral leases.,34
NA,The same situation arose when the Land Fund,34
NA,Commission attempted to acquire Laurel Downs,34
NA,pastoral lease for Aboriginal use. The Comwere,34
NA,"mission tendered $5,000 more than any other sites.",34
NA,tenderer but it was knocked back and the State,34
NA,pastoral lease eventually went to United States,34
NA,interests. The Chairman of the Kimberley Lands,34
NA,"Council, Mr Jimmy Bieundurry had this to say",34
NA,about no transfers of pastoral leases to Aborigi-,34
NA,nes being allowed by the Western Australian,34
NA,Court Government since 1977:,34
NA,It seems grossly inequitable that this small area of'Free',34
NA,land should be denied to a group in excess of 100 people,34
NA,"with a traditional association and a recognised land need, in",34
NA,favour of the marginal economic benefits it may have to a,34
NA,foreign company with millions of acres in WA and the,34
NA,Northern Territory.,34
NA,I return to Noonkanbah. Prior to the Amax drill-,34
NA,ings the Western Australian Government,34
NA,"received pleas from numerous sources, including",34
NA,the Western Australian Museum and the,34
NA,"National Aboriginal Council, not to allow drill-",34
NA,ing on sacred sights at Noonkanbah. This was,34
NA,the way the report of the Aboriginal Sites De-,34
NA,partment of the Western Australian Museum put,34
NA,the matter:,34
NA,Above all else a man . . . and his children were be-,34
NA,lieved to have actually originated from the area of the local,34
NA,descent group. That is to say their spirit emanated from a,34
NA,particular site within the countiy and returned there after,34
NA,death. A man or woman is therefore believed to be a living,34
NA,"part of the country, and to share a common spirituality with",34
NA,the land. If the land is damaged or in any way broken up,34
NA,then the spiritual component of a living person is also,34
NA,deemed to be at risk. Additionally the land is full of spiritual,34
NA,essence-,34
NA,The National Aboriginal Council passed these,34
NA,resolutions:,34
NA,That this full National Conference of the NAC urgently,34
NA,request the Minister's immediate intervention to halt pro-,34
NA,ceedings taken by West Australian State Government in,34
NA,allowing Amax Mining Company to conduct exploration on,34
NA,Noonkanbah.,34
NA,The National Aboriginal Conference request the Minister,34
NA,to urge the Federal Government to use the powers vested in,34
NA,"the Government in the 1967 Referendum, draw up legis-",34
NA,lation and in doing so:,34
NA,Guarantee full protection of Aboriginal sacred sites and,34
NA,insuring that NO exploration or mining take place within,34
NA,an area recognised as such.,34
NA,The Professor of Anthropology at the University,34
NA,of Western Australia had this to say:,34
NA,"It would be a tragedy if unresolved, clumsily handled",34
NA,issues of this sort were to leave an indelible mark on the,34
NA,reputation and development of this State.,34
NA,That approach can lead only to further dissatisfaction and,34
NA,"disilusionment, and to contempt and dismay on the part of",34
NA,all of us who are concerned with human welfare and justice.,34
NA,"Instead of taking heed of those calls, what did we",34
NA,see the Court Government do? On 18 March,34
NA,under the umbrella of 35 police Amax moved in,34
NA,"to drill, accompanied by officials of the West",34
NA,Australian Mines Department. The Aborigines,34
NA,given five minutes to decide on one of two,34
NA,An injunction was granted to prevent drill-,34
NA,ing for one week but water drilling subsequently,34
NA,commenced on the weekend of 28 and 29 March.,34
NA,I have here the words of the West Australian,35
NA,NA,35
NA,which appeared in the West Australian. He was,35
NA,present on that occasion. I ask the House to think,35
NA,about these words as they are very well put. The,35
NA,article states:,35
NA,As the drills dug into the ground which the Noonkanbah,35
NA,"people hold as sacred, I felt",35
NA,of these people left the degradation of alcohol excesses,35
NA,social upheaval to return to the land at Noonkanbah.,35
NA,On Saturday-,35
NA,Because of the Court Government-,35
NA,they lost a little bit more of themselves.,35
NA,I was there with the honourable member for,35
NA,"Fremantle ( Mr Dawkins) on April 2, which was",35
NA,a watershed day in Aboriginal land rights histhe,35
NA,tory. Passive confrontation was successful when,35
NA,"130 Aborigines, in the presence of eight or nine",35
NA,"police officers, requested Amax to leave without",35
NA,any violence. To everyone's great surprise Amax,35
NA,left. Why? I say to the House that it was simply,35
NA,because Amax realised that the alternative was,35
NA,to hold a police presence there for the whole duron,35
NA,ation of the drilling and that that was not possfor,35
NA,ible. It was a moral victory for the Aboriginal,35
NA,people on that day which posed a huge dilemma,35
NA,to the Court Government in Western Australia.,35
NA,Let me trace some of the Premier's,35
NA,tion to this withdrawal by Amax was one of com-,35
NA,plete fury. The next day in all of the media we,35
NA,were informed that Court said-,35
NA,"Mr Cotter- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a",35
NA,point of order. I ask that the honourable member,35
NA,withdraw the reference to the Premier of Wesglad,35
NA,tern Australia as having told lies.,35
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Millar)- Western,35
NA,Whilst the honourable member's remark was Minister's,35
NA,"not directed to any member of this House, it",35
NA,constitute unparliamentary language. I ask,35
NA,to withdraw.,35
Mr WEST,"I n deference to you, Mr Deputy",35
NA,"Speaker, I will withdraw. The Western Austern",35
NA,tralian Premier offered misrepresentations to,35
NA,people of Australia. He said that the,35
NA,agreed to drilling. That was incorrect. He said,35
NA,they had threatened violence to Amax personnel.,35
NA,Police who were present would deny that. He,35
NA,says that the whole situation is due to white stirwilling,35
NA,"rers. In fact, it is the tribal elders, many of",35
NA,lived through horrors such as the Forrest River,35
NA,"massacre in 1926, who are leading the Aborigiassert",35
NA,nal movement at Noonkanbah. In case the forces,35
NA,"House doubts what I am saying, let me trace",35
NA,"some of the recent utterances of this bellicose,",35
NA,"belligerent, intransigent, insensitive and inept",35
NA,Western Australian Premier on this issue. Before,35
NA,an article the drilling he said:,35
NA,We believe that enough time has been spent on the matter.,35
NA,It has been the subject of discussion for a long time.,35
NA,After the withdrawal he went on to say that drill-,35
NA,ing would proceed-whethe r by Amax or some-,35
NA,one else. Later on the following weekend Sir,35
NA,ashamed of my white skin. Many,35
NA,and Charles Court said that in preparation for the,35
NA,company's return to the site the Government,35
NA,would co-operate in organising logistical and,35
NA,other support. What does he mean by 'logistical,35
NA,support?' He obviously means one thing- a,35
NA,massive police presence to protect the Amax,35
NA,drilling operation.,35
NA,All this has simply resulted in the hardening of,35
NA,Aboriginal position to meet an intransigent,35
NA,State Government position. I was there again last,35
NA,Saturday at a bush meeting on the banks of the,35
NA,Fitzroy River where Aboriginal law men had,35
NA,gathered from 30 Kimberley communities. They,35
NA,carried resolutions calling for no mining on,35
NA,sacred sites and no mining at all on Noonkanbah,35
NA,the complete lease for three years. They called,35
NA,"the Federal Minister's intervening, using his",35
NA,"powers under section 51 of the Constitution, and",35
NA,they resolved that all communities in the Kim-,35
NA,berleys would support the Noonkanbah,35
NA,lies. His reacAborigines.,35
NA,What has the Federal Minister been doing,35
NA,while all this has been going on? That is the $64,35
NA,question that I ask this House. I refer to a Press,35
NA,statement which states that before the confron-,35
NA,tation on 2 April the Minister said that he was,35
NA,to see the rumour that the company would,35
NA,enter the property without notice and with police,35
NA,protection had been laid to rest by the Premier of,35
NA,Australia. How naive can one get? The,35
NA,prime action afterwards was to write a,35
NA,does long letter to the West Australian which he,35
NA,him ended by virtually begging for an absence of,35
NA,confrontation. The tragedy of this Government's,35
NA,handling of Aboriginal affairs is simply that its,35
NA,two Ministers responsible have come from Wes-,35
NA,Australia and they appear unable to handle,35
NA,the the reactionary Court Government and the Wes-,35
NA,Aborigines tern Australian Liberal Party.,35
NA,Senator Chaney has been seen in Western,35
NA,"Australia as a weak, ineffectual Minister not",35
NA,to confront the Liberals in his home State.,35
NA,whom He was very lucky to receive a reprieve on 2,35
NA,"April, but he is now frittering away the chance to",35
NA,Federal power. Will he delay until Court,35
NA,Amax back in to a further confrontation,35
NA,with Aborigines at Noonkanbah? If he waits,35
NA,"until Premier Court achieves that, it is virtually",35
NA,certain that a large police presence will be,35
NA,"necessary, and then he will be forced to use Fed-",36
NA,eral powers eventually whether he likes it or not.,36
NA,"On Friday, 4 April, I talked personally with",36
NA,Senator Chaney in Western Australia. The,36
NA,honourable member for Fremantle and I,36
NA,"proposed: Firstly, that a new investigation and",36
NA,mapping of sacred sites be undertaken on the,36
NA,"leases; secondly, that Amax suspend its oper-",36
NA,"ations while this takes place; thirdly, that the",36
NA,original community be asked to nominate a rep-,36
NA,"resentative to the mapping team; fourthly, that a",36
NA,new mapping team be led by an independent,36
NA,"authority such as Professor Rowley or perhaps, if",36
NA,"acceptable to him, by Dr H. Coombs and; fifthly,",36
NA,that the Government and Amax commit them-,36
NA,selves to accepting thefindingsof the study and,36
NA,avoiding drilling and other mining activities in,36
NA,the areas so designated. What has happened?,36
NA,The Federal Minister has not acted! On the con-,36
NA,"trary, the latest attitude of the Court Govern-",36
NA,ment is epitomised in a statement made by the,36
NA,"Western Australian Minister for Cultural Affairs,",36
NA,"Bill Grayden, who has responsibility fpr Aborigi-",36
NA,nal affairs. All he has done is to accuse the,36
NA,Aboriginal and union groups of using,36
NA,confrontation-style tactics to assert territorial,36
NA,claims. He told the Western Australian Cabinet,36
NA,that Noonkanbah had been chosen as a focal,36
NA,point for these claims and had become one of the,36
NA,spearheads of Aboriginal territory advancement.,36
NA,What nonsense! Noonkanbah obviously is a dry,36
NA,run for diamond mining in the north east Kim-,36
NA,berleys where the Ashton joint venture is 57 per,36
NA,cent owned by Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd.,36
NA,It is a gearing up to put into effect a massive dia-,36
NA,mond mining operation near Kununurra. The,36
NA,Opposition is saying that the time has come for,36
NA,Federal intervention in an examination of the,36
NA,"whole land rights question, to present model",36
NA,"land rights legislation to the States, to allow",36
NA,Aborigines to run their own land developments,36
NA,commission and to effect Federal and State,36
NA,agreements to define sacred sites wherever they,36
NA,may be!,36
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Millar) or,36
NA,Order! The honourable member's time has ningham,36
NA,expired.,36
Mr RUDDOCK ,Dundas) (4.6)-I was disapMinister,36
NA,pointed at the way in which the honourable,36
NA,member for Cunningham ( Mr West) dealt with visits,36
NA,"this topic. I was disappointed,firstly,because",36
NA,did not cover the issue which the Australian,36
NA,Labor Party put forward as a matter of public,36
NA,"importance and, secondly-perhap s more",36
NA,importantly-a t the snide references he made,36
NA,relation to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs,36
NA,(Senator Chaney). I do not believe in this im-,36
NA,portant area it is helpful for honourable,36
NA,members to be calling each other names and to,36
NA,be making the snide comments of the sort made,36
NA,by the honourable member for Cunningham.,36
NA,Those sorts of comments only invite retaliation.,36
NA,"In this case, I do not think the honourable",36
NA,member for Cunningham is in a position to sug-,36
NA,Abgest that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in,36
NA,any way lacks interest in Aboriginal people,36
NA,"simply because he failed to make two visits, as",36
NA,"the honourable member opposite suggest, in the",36
NA,last couple of weeks.,36
NA,If one were to look at the performance of the,36
NA,honourable member of Cunningham in relation,36
NA,to Aboriginal affairs during thetimehe has been,36
NA,in the Parliament one could be forgiven for ask-,36
NA,ing whether he knew whether Aboriginals,36
NA,existed before he was appointed Opposition,36
NA,spokesman on Aboriginal anairs. I searched the,36
NA,Hansard record to find out the extent of his con-,36
NA,tributions to matters relating to Aboriginal,36
NA,affairs. I found that he had asked one question,36
NA,which was part of a run of questions on a particu-,36
NA,lar issue. Obviously those questions were handed,36
NA,out to members of the Opposition. In a speech on,36
NA,the Human Rights Commission Bill he made a,36
NA,passing reference to Aboriginals in the context of,36
NA,the racial discrimination legislation. He seeks to,36
NA,compare his performance with the considerable,36
NA,interest of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs,36
NA,which has been well known for many years.,36
NA,The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is well,36
NA,known for his involvement in the Aboriginal,36
NA,legal rights movement in Western Australia and,36
NA,for his willingness to work for Aboriginal people.,36
NA,He is well known in this Parliament for his in-,36
NA,volvement in the Aboriginal affairs committees,36
NA,of the Government. He is well known for his dis-,36
NA,tinguished service on the Joint Committee on the,36
NA,Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory),36
NA,Act and for the very distinguished contribution,36
NA,he made to that legislation. I do not think it is fair,36
NA,proper for the honourable member for Cun-,36
NA,to make snide references to the Minis-,36
NA,ter for Aboriginal Affairs who has performed so,36
NA,well in this area both before he was appointed,36
NA,and as Minister. The mere fact that the,36
NA,honourable member for Cunningham made two,36
NA,to a certain location after being appointed,36
NA,he Opposition spokesman on Aboriginal affairs,36
NA,does not make him an expert. I think that can be,36
NA,no more carefully documented than by reading,36
NA,the speech made by the honourable member for,36
NA,in Cunningham today. Although it was laced with,36
NA,quotes it showed that he still does not understand,36
NA,the issue which is involved. The matter of public,37
NA,importance is in these terms:,37
NA,The urgent need for the use of Commonwealth powers,37
NA,prevent deteriorating relations between the Kimberley,37
NA,Aborigines and mining companies and the Western Aus-,37
NA,tralian Government.,37
NA,What is he asking for? He is asking for 'the use of,37
NA,Commonwealth powers'. Did his address take,37
NA,up the matter of those powers? The only occasion,37
NA,on which he referred to Commonwealth powers,37
NA,was when he referred to a meeting of legal,37
NA,officers which had considered this question. He,37
NA,referred obliquely to section 51 of the,37
NA,Constitution. I ask the honourable member for,37
NA,Cunningham whether he knows what section 51,37
NA,of the Constitution is about. It is a section of the,37
NA,Constitution which has many parts to it. It would,37
NA,be helpful to know what parts he was referring,37
NA,to. Was he endeavouring to suggest that the,37
NA,Commonwealth should exercise its power in re-,37
NA,lation to restrictions on the export of minerals? Is,37
NA,that what he was trying to do? Was he trying to,37
NA,suggest that the Commonwealth ought to use its,37
NA,powers to make laws for people of a specific,37
NA,race-tha t might include Aboriginals-a s a basis,37
NA,for legislating in this area? Was he suggesting,37
NA,that the Commonwealth Government should use,37
NA,its power to acquire land for purposes of the,37
NA,Commonwealth?,37
NA,"Mr West-Now , you've got it.",37
Mr RUDDOCK,If that is the basis of his ar-,37
NA,gument it is rather fascinating because never be-,37
NA,fore have I heard honourable members opposite,37
NA,try to look at this question objectively. The,37
NA,power to acquire land is the power to do so on,37
NA,just terms. What does that mean? The power to,37
NA,acquire land on just terms means that the,37
NA,"Commonwealth, when approaching a particular",37
NA,"State to acquire land, has to pay for that land not",37
NA,the value which is determined by the Govern-,37
NA,ment but the value which is evaluated indepen-,37
NA,dently. That matter ultimately can be disputed in,37
NA,the courts. The fact of the matter is that we can-,37
NA,vassed this question in some detail when we,37
NA,looked at the most complex situation in,37
NA,Queensland.,37
NA,Honourable members ought to understand,37
NA,what the passage down that road means to the,37
NA,Commonwealth. They ought to realise the tax-,37
NA,ation consequences it would have for the people,37
NA,of Australia. Mark my words: If the Common-,37
NA,wealth Government buys land for the Aborigines,37
NA,"in Western Australia, Queensland or any other",37
NA,State in order to protect the interests of,37
NA,"Aborigines, it has to buy the mineral rights of",37
NA,that land. If there happens to be extensive aggre-,37
NA,gations of minerals in a particular area the Com-,37
NA,monwealth Government in effect would have to,37
NA,"to buy those minerals from the State, if the State",37
NA,owned the land. I do not have the figures at my,37
NA,fingertips but if that is the path the Opposition,37
NA,wishes to tread the Commonwealth Government,37
NA,"would need to expend hundreds, i f not thou-",37
NA,"sands, of millions of dollars. What would that do",37
NA,to Aboriginal programs throughout Australia?,37
NA,We know how much money is available in the,37
NA,Budget for programs for Aboriginal people. We,37
NA,would be lucky to buy minimal areas of land for,37
NA,Aborigines with money allocated in the Budget.,37
NA,"We would have to forgo housing programs,",37
NA,"health programs, education programs and Abor-",37
NA,iginal legal aid services. Are honourable,37
NA,members opposite suggesting that this is the path,37
NA,we should follow? I do not believe it is.,37
NA,Let us examine the record of honourable,37
NA,members opposite when they were in govern-,37
NA,ment. When dealing with legislation in this area,37
NA,and when dealing with the report of Mr Justice,37
NA,"Woodward in 1975, the Labor Government did",37
NA,not seek to extend the operation of that legis-,37
NA,lation beyond the Northern Territory. That,37
NA,ought to be made known. In 1975 the then Min-,37
NA,"ister for Aboriginal Affairs, the honourable",37
NA,"member for Hughes ( Mr Les Johnson),",37
NA,introduced a Bill in relation to Aboriginal land,37
NA,rights. Ultimately that legislation was completed,37
NA,by this Government. In his second reading,37
NA,speech the then Minister stated:,37
NA,. . . that the Australian Parliament may only legislate in,37
NA,"this direction in the Northern Territory is a matter of regret,",37
NA,but we have made it clear to the various State Governments,37
NA,that we support similar recognition of Aboriginal land title in,37
NA,the States.,37
NA,That is the position I have adopted in this House.,37
NA,I regard the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern,37
NA,Territory) Act as a model. I believe it is appropri-,37
NA,ate that the States should implement similar,37
NA,legislation in relation to Aboriginal land. I be-,37
NA,lieve that if such legislation had been enacted in,37
NA,the States we would be in a far better position in,37
NA,relation to Western Australia than we are at the,37
NA,moment. There is no doubt about that. I believe,37
NA,also that the comment is pertinent to New South,37
NA,Wales-the State from which I come and from,37
NA,which the honourable member for Cunningham,37
NA,comes. It will be interesting to see the results,37
NA,which emerge from the committee of inquiry in,37
NA,New South Wales because we have seen no great,37
NA,enthusiasm to take up the Woodward committee,37
NA,report and to implement its terms holus-bolus;,37
NA,nor have we seen any great enthusiasm for the,37
NA,provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights,37
NA,(Northern Territory) Act to be introduced holusrecognised,38
NA,bolus in New South Wales.,38
NA,Mr West-The y are slightly more enthusiastic,38
NA,than Court.,38
Mr RUDDOCK,Are they slightly more,38
NA,enthusiastic? I would like to see action rather,38
NA,than words. Let us wait and see. The path is a,38
NA,tortuous one. If we examine the steps taken,38
NA,various State governments of various political,38
NA,persuasions- I am referring to Labor and nonfor,38
NA,Labor State governments-w e will find that to,38
NA,"date they have been unwilling, although they",38
NA,"have the powers to do so, to adopt legislation",38
NA,which enables these matters to be resolved,38
NA,framework in which legitimate Aboriginal nal people.,38
NA,interests and the interests of the community gen-,38
NA,erally are taken into account. That is what is per-,38
NA,mitted by the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern,38
NA,Territory) Act.,38
NA,It has to be understood that in this area,38
NA,iginal land rights and mining developments,38
NA,not mutually exclusive. I was fascinated by the,38
NA,opening remarks of the honourable member for,38
NA,Cunningham. He appeared to suggest that in,38
NA,"some way they were incompatible. Recently, I",38
NA,was at a land rights forum in New South Wales.,38
NA,We all know that honourable members opposite,38
NA,take an interest in uranium development. They,38
NA,have a somewhat adverse view to such developreasonable,38
NA,ment. At that meeting I heard an Aboriginal,38
NA,speaking after a rather rabid anti-uranium,38
NA,speaker. I am not suggesting that he was a,38
NA,member of the Labor Party. The Aboriginal from,38
NA,"stood up and said: 'What are you on about,",38
NA,mate? Are you here about uranium or Aboriginal,38
NA,land rights?' He was not interested in whether he,38
NA,was making an anti-uranium speech. All he priate,38
NA,wanted to know was that Aboriginal land rights pass,38
NA,would be protected. That was his real concern some,38
NA,and his real interest. By the very nature of his indrawn.,38
NA,"terjection, I think he recognised that mining",38
NA,velopment and land rights are not incompatible.,38
NA,They can be the subject of negotiation between,38
NA,reasonable men who have an intention of overresolve,38
NA,coming what difficulties may arise between,38
NA,and are prepared to take into account each,38
NA,other's interests.,38
NA,The honourable member for Cunningham,38
NA,made some mention of an article written by the,38
NA,Minister for Aboriginal Affairs for the West Aus-,38
NA,"tralian. Clearly, the Minister and members on",38
NA,this side of the House are very much aware of the,38
NA,interests of the Aboriginal people in their land,38
NA,and traditional sites. In that article the Minister,38
NA,spelt out in some detail the spiritual significance,38
NA,"of land to Aboriginals. Of course, it has to be",38
NA,that it is not significant to the same,38
NA,degree in relation to every location or to every,38
NA,site. Aboriginal interest does not follow the,38
NA,boundaries of a pastoral lease. Aboriginal,38
NA,interest is in very particular and precise locations.,38
NA,I was interested in the comments by the,38
NA,honourable member for Cunningham suggesting,38
NA,that his own approach to the Minister was to seek,38
NA,by a new investigation and mapping of Aboriginal,38
NA,sites and the suspension of the Amax operations,38
NA,the time being in an endeavour to settle upon,38
NA,new personalities that might be involved in such,38
NA,"a mapping task, presumably after discussions",38
NA,"with the Western Australian Government, the",38
NA,in a Commonwealth Government and the Aborigi-,38
NA,Mr West-Wha t do you suggest?',38
Mr RUDDOCK,"Quite frankly, I thought that",38
NA,that was a positive suggestion. It was not the sug-,38
NA,Aborgestion that the honourable member for Cun-,38
NA,are ningham made today. He said that the Common-,38
NA,wealth ought to use some imaginary powers that,38
NA,it has to enable it to march into the States,38
NA,tomorrow and to grant Aboriginal land rights on,38
NA,some other basis. The fact ofthe matter is that,38
NA,there can be no such approach. The Minister for,38
NA,"Aboriginal Affairs, in all his statements on this",38
NA,"topic, has said that there is an opportunity for",38
NA,men to sit down together and to work,38
NA,out an appropriate response; and he was pursu-,38
NA,ing these matters with the Western Australian,38
NA,Government. It might be helpful for me to quote,38
NA,some of the speeches of the Minister in the,38
NA,other place. I quote from a speech made on this,38
NA,topic in the Senate chamber on 1 April. He said:,38
NA,"In all those circumstances, I do not believe it is an appro-",38
NA,case where the Commonwealth ought to step in and,38
NA,its own legislation which in turn would have to make in,38
NA,way the same distinctions as are now trying to be,38
NA,deHe was speaking about the difficulties experi-,38
NA,enced when discussions take place between Ab-,38
NA,"originals, government and mining companies to",38
NA,questions as to where mining might and,38
NA,them might not be appropriate. He went on:,38
NA,There is a situation in Western Australia' at the moment,38
NA,which is not totally satisfactory because of lack of clarity. I,38
NA,am pursuing with the Western Australian Government some,38
NA,better set of rules which could be more easily understood by,38
NA,all concerned.,38
NA,If honourable members look at the speech that,38
NA,he made on that same day and on the same topic,38
NA,they will see that he had this to say:,38
NA,It is the consistent cry of the Opposition that we should use,38
NA,the powers given in the 1976 referendum to override the,38
NA,States and thereby advance Aboriginal welfare. I would see,38
NA,"that as a last resort, bearing in mind that in so many key",38
NA,fields it is the States that deliver the services that,39
NA,"tial to Aborigines, be they education, health, welfare, hous-",39
NA,"ing, police or the court system.",39
NA,Aboriginals can be plucked out of Australia's general politi-,39
NA,cal and administrative system and made sub-,39
NA,"ject . . . to some system of Commonwealth law is, in",39
NA,"my view, to fly in the face of reality, a reality which the",39
NA,Labor Party when in government had to face and which tem-,39
NA,pered its rhetoric.,39
NA,These are important questions. There is scope,39
NA,"further negotiations and discussions. In my view,",39
NA,not even the Labor Party realistically in the,39
NA,or even now puts forward the proposition that,39
NA,there ought to be intervention by the that,39
NA,Commonwealth.,39
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr MILLAR - long,39
NA,Order! The honourable member's time has of,39
NA,expired.,39
Mr DAWKINS ,Fremantle) (4.20)-The,39
NA,speech by the honourable member for Dundas,39
NA,( Mr Ruddock) was an appropriate speech. At,39
NA,least it was consistent with everything this,39
NA,Government has been saying in the field of,39
NA,Aboriginal Affairs since it came into office,39
NA,1975. The speech was full of lots,39
NA,tions but nothing more. He quoted some earlier,39
NA,instances where the good intentions of Govern-,39
NA,ment had led to an allegedly appropriate result.,39
NA,He instanced the Aurukun and Mornington Australian,39
NA,Island situation. I say to the honourable member,39
NA,for Dundas: If he thinks the solution at Aurukun,39
NA,and Mornington Island is an appropriate solin,39
NA,"ution for the situaton in the Kimberleys, he will",39
NA,find that he is on a complete collision course,39
NA,the Aboriginal people of the Kimberleys. The,39
NA,Aurukun and Mornington Island solution was a,39
NA,disaster. As a result of that the Minister for,39
NA,"iginal Affairs at that time, Mr Viner, was forced",39
NA,out of his portfolio. The Aurukun and MorningHe,39
NA,ton Island dispute destroyed him. Just as surely,39
NA,"as that happened, this dispute in the Kimberleys",39
NA,will destroy the current Minister for Aboriginal,39
NA,Affairs (Senator Chaney) unless he takes,39
NA,positive action and talks about more than just,39
NA,good intentions.,39
NA,These good intentions have come from the,39
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) down. Perthat,39
NA,haps I can just quote from a speech made by,39
NA,Prime Minister in 1978 when he was opening the,39
NA,National Aboriginal Conference: He said:,39
NA,It was never good enough for politicians or bureaucrats,39
NA,whether at the State or Federal,39
NA,iginal people their conception of what was good,39
NA,original people.,39
NA,Yet that is exactly what has been happening,39
NA,and again. Vain and egotistical State Premiers,39
NA,have been trying to force their wishes on the,39
NA,original people of this country. It istimethat this,39
NA,are so essensort of self-righteousness on the part of this,39
NA,Government gave way to a little positive action.,39
NA,To suggest that in some way,39
NA,Let me instance another example. In 1978 the,39
NA,"then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Viner,",39
NA,was at Docker River. I was present at that site,39
NA,where the title deeds to the Petermann Ranges,39
NA,were handed over to the people of that region in,39
NA,for the Northern Territory. The ceremony took place,39
NA,"in Western Australia, for the very good reason",39
NA,past that Western Australian Aborigines had no land,39
NA,rights nor the prospect of any. The Minister took,39
NA,opportunity to express his support for the,39
NA,land claims of the people of Western Australia.,39
NA,He indicated his hope that it would not be too,39
NA,before they too had the same sort of tenure,39
NA,land as that held by the people in the North-,39
NA,ern Territory. Later he expressed the view that,39
NA,there ought to be a common approach to land,39
NA,"rights in relation to that central area, parts of",39
NA,"which are in South Australia, the Northern Terri-",39
NA,tory and Western Australia. Nothing happened.,39
NA,As far as the Aboriginal people of that area were,39
NA,in concerned it was just more good intentions and,39
NA,of good intenmore disappointment.,39
NA,I come now to the current Minister. A refer-,39
NA,ence has been made to his article in the West,39
NA,of 11 April. I find very little in that,39
NA,article with which I can disagree. There are a,39
NA,couple of very substantive matters on which I am,39
NA,"severe disagreement with the Minister, but in",39
NA,terms of it being a fairly vacuous statement ofhis,39
NA,with good intentions I cannot really disagree. What,39
NA,"we need is something more than self-righteous,",39
NA,vacuous good intentions on the part of Ministers,39
NA,Aborin this Government. The Minister said that he,39
NA,was in favour of the preservation of scared sites.,39
NA,supports the idea that Aboriginals need to,39
NA,have land and access to more land. But all he is,39
NA,prepared to do is say that he will try to talk,39
NA,around to his point of view the Premier of Wes-,39
NA,some tern Australia. The honourable member for,39
NA,his Dundas said that the Minister believes that these,39
NA,are questions which can be sorted out by reason-,39
NA,able men. I ask: Is the Premier of Western,39
NA,Australia a reasonable man? Even if we concede,39
NA,"Senator Chaney is a reasonable man, is the",39
NA,the Premier of Western Australia a reasonable man?,39
NA,"Clearly, he is not. In my view, and as the honour-",39
NA,able member for Cunningham ( Mr West) has,39
NA,"already outlined, the Premier and his Ministers",39
NA,are temperamentally unsuited to deal with this,39
NA,level to impose on the Abor-,39
NA,for the Abissue. All they have been prepared to do is,39
NA,score political points at the expense of the,39
NA,besieged people of Noonkanbah. They have,39
NA,time misrepresented and distorted those people's,39
NA,views and actions on numerous occasions. As a,39
NA,"Abconsequence, they have totally lost any chance",39
NA,that they ever had of trying to solve this dispute.,40
NA,They have demonstrated that they are not leave to do so.,40
NA,"reasonable men, nor are they interested in solv-",40
NA,ing the underlying problems at Noonkanbah.,40
NA,They do not seem to understand the sorts of,40
NA,people with whom they are dealing.,40
NA,seem to understand the sorts of lives that most of 2d Session,40
NA,these old men at Noonkanbah have lived. They,40
NA,have lived through massacre; they have lived in,40
NA,circumstances of gross discrimination. If they,40
NA,had raised their heads in support of their claims a,40
NA,"few years ago, they would have been brutally",40
NA,"repressed, as the honourable member for Dun-",40
NA,das knows. The Minister makes another point.,40
NA,He says that we must not threaten the good re-,40
NA,lations between black and white in this country.,40
NA,"Of course, one has to agree with that point, but",40
NA,for how much longer will it be the Aboriginal,40
NA,people who have to bear the burden of good re-,40
NA,lations between black and white in this country?,40
NA,For how much longer will Aboriginals have to be,40
NA,the ones on whom the responsibility falls? Do,40
NA,they have to sit by and take what is meted out to,40
NA,"them by an aggressive white community, par-",40
NA,ticularly in the Kimberleys? What has the Minis-,40
NA,"ter had to say about Mr Widdell, who tried to",40
NA,intoxicate members of the Turkey Creek com-,40
NA,munity so that they could not take part in the,40
NA,State election? What has the Minister had to say,40
NA,about the Police Commissioner who has rounded,40
NA,"up Aborigines, put them in paddy wagons and",40
NA,then cross-examined them about their voting justice,40
NA,procedures or about the way in which they voted tralian,40
NA,at the last State election?,40
NA,For how much longer will Aboriginal people,40
NA,have to put up with this sort of treatment in the,40
NA,interests of good relations between black and,40
NA,white? It seems to me that it is high time that the,40
NA,Aborigines were given a fair go. They have,40
NA,begun now-belatedl y but with a great deal of,40
NA,"passion-t o stand up for their rights, particularly",40
NA,"their land rights, and for their beliefs. It is time notwithstanding,",40
NA,that the Minister stopped hiding behind the ideal,40
NA,of good relations between black and white,40
NA,simply to see the Aboriginals of this country,40
NA,trodden under foot by the State Government yet,40
NA,again.,40
NA,I wish briefly to refer to another matter which,40
NA,involves this situation very much. In February,40
NA,"this year, just a couple of months ago, we saw a",40
NA,report prepared by the State Department of the,40
NA,United States of America for a committee of the,40
NA,House of Representatives and a committee of the,40
NA,Senate in that country. It is entitled: 'Country Re-,40
NA,ports on Human Rights Practices for 1979'. I,40
NA,have spoken to the Minister who was at the table,40
NA,earlier and he gave me permission to have this,40
NA,document incorporated in Hansard. I now seek,40
NA,Leave granted.,40
NA,The document read asfollows-,40

NA,The Federal Racial Discrimination Act of 1975 prohibits all,40

NA,"of this Act, Australia ratified the International Convention",40
NA,"on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination,",40
NA,thereby undertaking a commitment to combat racism both at,40
NA,home and abroad. The Racial Discrimination Act of 1975,40
NA,which overrides any existing laws that may,40
NA,"operate with a discriminatory effect, the Queensland",40
NA,Government has been accused of administering certain laws,40
NA,relating to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in a way,40
NA,that has the effect of discriminating between the rights of,40
NA,white and black Australians. This fact is recognized by the,40
NA,"Government of Australia which, through the Office of the",40

NA,amounting to some 28 per cent in the fiscal year ending 10,41
NA,June 1979. Public education is universal and free and in-,41
NA,cludes special facilities for the handicapped. There is a gen-,41
NA,eral right of ownership of private property which is protected,41
NA,by law.,41
NA,Aboriginal rights and development are of constant and,41
NA,active concern in Australia. Because of deep cultural,41
NA,differences between the Aboriginal and European popu-,41
NA,"lations, the Commonwealth Government experienced great",41
NA,difficulty in pursuing its former policy of assimilation,41
NA,through promoting social change among the Aboriginals so,41
NA,that they would become indistinguishable from other Aus-,41
NA,"tralians in standards of living,",41
NA,"in community affairs. By late 197S, government policy had",41
NA,changed to one of commitment to the principle that Aborigi-,41
NA,nals should be as free as other Australians to determine their,41
NA,own varied futures. The policy of the Queensland Govern-,41
NA,"ment, however, continues to promote the concept of full inte-",41
NA,gration of all indigenous people.,41
NA,The Government acknowledges that in general the Aborigi-,41
NA,nal population is disadvantaged,41
NA,"housing, health and employment. Through the Department",41
NA,"of Aboriginal Affairs and other federal and state agencies,",41
NA,the Government has sought to secure for Aboriginals access,41
NA,to government service equal to that accorded other Aus-,41
NA,tralian citizens together with,41
NA,to their disadvantaged state. Special programs have been,41
NA,undertaken to assist Aboriginals in becoming self-sufficient.,41
NA,"These include encouragement of land ownership, expansion",41
NA,"of employment opportunities, training programs, support for",41
NA,"small business acquisition, home ownership and involve-",41
NA,ment in other development projects. These policies are,41
NA,directed toward helping the Aboriginals to become economi-,41
NA,cally self-sufficient while preserving their distinctive,41

NA,"strict a person from organizing or conducting a procession,",41
NA,"meeting, or assembly in a public place without the per-",41
NA,mission of the Commissioner of Police. The Commissioner,41
NA,"may not, however, withhold such permission unless he has",41
NA,reason to believe there will be a disturbance. A few trade,41
NA,unionists in West Australia have been arrested and fined for,41
NA,"violations of this law. In Queensland, laws governing street",41

NA,Indochina have been admitted for permanent residence in,41
NA,Australia.,41
NA,c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process,41
NA,"Commonwealth law guarantees this freedom, which is",41
NA,respected in practice. Complaints have been made that cer-,41
NA,tain amendments to the electoral laws of West Australia,41
NA,have the effect of restricting the right of Aboriginals to vote.,41
NA,These provisions relate to enrollment and voting procedures,41
NA,and could be applied in a manner to discourage voting by,41
NA,Aboriginals and others notfluentin English. In at least one,41
NA,"instance, illiterates were prevented from using' how to vote'",41
NA,cards and the outcome ofthe elections was overturned by the,41
NA,Australian courts. Women have enjoyed full political and,41
NA,civil rights in Australia since the turn of the century. In prac-,41
NA,"tice, however, they do not participate in the political and",41
NA,economic life of the country to the same extent as men. There,41
NA,"are six women members of the Federal Senate, but no",41
NA,woman serves currently in the House of Representatives.,41
NA,"The Australian trade union is strong, well-organized and",41
NA,active both in politics and in industrial relations. The rights,41
NA,"to organize, strike, bargain collectively and lobby are",41
NA,guaranteed in law and exercised in practice.,41

NA,national and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged,41
NA,Violations of Human Rights:,41
NA,The Department of State has no knowledge of any requests,41
NA,to investigate alleged violations of humanrightsin Australia,41
NA,by international or non-governmental organizations.,41
Mr DAWKINS,I thank the House. The im-,41
NA,"in such areas as education,",41
NA,portant thing about this report is that it is an,41
NA,examination of human rights around the world.,41
NA,There is a section on Australia. Whilst in many,41
NA,"respects Australia fares well, there are a number",41
NA,additional services appropriate,41
NA,of areas in which this report levels some criticism.,41
NA,"For instance, it criticises the Queensland",41
NA,Government in relation to its treatment of Abor-,41
NA,igines. It also criticises the Queensland Govern-,41
NA,ment in relation to its laws of assembly. It is criti-,41
NA,cal of the Government of Western Australia in,41
NA,culture. relation to those parts of that State's electoral,41
NA,laws which discriminate against Aboriginal,41
NA,people. It also criticises the Western Australian,41
NA,Government in respect of its Police Act as it re-,41
NA,of these basic rights and they,41
NA,lates to the laws of assembly. This criticism,41
NA,should be a matter of acute embarrassment to,41
NA,"this Federal Government. After all, the Aus-",41
NA,tralian Government has become a member of,41
NA,the United Nations Human Rights Commission.,41
NA,"It is, after all, the Australian Government which",41
NA,is responsible for the reputation of this country,41
NA,overseas. This Government has to act at national,42
NA,"level in order to preserve our good name, if for",42
NA,no other reason-i f it is not interested in protect-,42
NA,ing the rights of the Aboriginal people in this,42
NA,country.,42
NA,There is a separate international question also.,42
NA,That is that at Noonkanbah it is an American,42
NA,company which has been pushed by the State,42
NA,Government into desecrating sacred sites. I think,42
NA,Amax (Exploration) Australia Inc. is probably,42
NA,an unwilling partner in this exercise. I would not,42
NA,be at all surprised if Amax did not go back to,42
NA,that site at Pea Hill. It is an American company,42
NA,which is being pushed into this situation. That is,42
NA,something which would never happen in the,42
NA,United States. This is an international matter.,42
NA,This Government can ignore that fact no longer.,42
NA,The honourable member for Dundas seems to,42
NA,balk at the prospect of the Commonwealth,42
NA,Government taking any effective action on this,42
NA,matter. I would have thought-an d I am sure that,42
NA,the honourable member for Cunningham would,42
NA,have thought-tha t the honourable member for,42
NA,Dundas would have read the Senate committee,42
NA,"report of 1978, which lucidly enunciates the ways",42
NA,in which the Commonwealth can intervene in,42
NA,this area. It can acquire land and such acquisition,42
NA,does not necessarily need to have the horrendous,42
NA,consequences to which the honourable member,42
NA,for Dundas was alluding.,42
NA,The whole point is that we will never,42
NA,reasonable discussions on these question,42
NA,mining on Aboriginal land or on sacred sites,42
NA,less we improve the tenure of the Aboriginal,42
NA,people over their land. There is no point in proon,42
NA,posing palsy-walsy discussions with the Aborigithe,42
NA,nes if they have no rights to the land in question.,42
NA,They have no rights at all at the moment.,42
NA,tenure of the land has to be improved so that years.,42
NA,they can participate meaningfully in any,42
NA,tiations which take place. We are not saying,42
NA,there should be no mining anywhere on,42
NA,nal land. What we are saying is that the Aborigimember,42
NA,"nes, as a result of their prior ownership of this",42
NA,"country, have a right to be reasonably consulted",42
NA,about the natureof the resource development,42
NA,and where it will take place. That is all that,42
NA,are asking for.,42
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr MILLAR -,42
NA,Order! The honourable member's time has,42
NA,expired.,42
Mr COTTER ,Kalgoorlie) (4.31)- I should,42
NA,like to deal with a few of the remarks made by,42
NA,the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr,42
NA,"Dawkins), especially in relation to their inaccur-",42
NA,acy in relation to the subject which is now under,42
NA,discussion. We are talking about the rights of,42
NA,"Aboriginals, land rights and the various means",42
NA,"of tenure of land in Australia, with particular ref-",42
NA,erence to Western Australia. The land that is,42
NA,"held at Noonkanbah, which is the subject of a",42
NA,"great deal of discussion today, is a pastoral lease.",42
NA,Amongst many other pastoral leases in Western,42
NA,"Australia, it does not carry particular rights in re-",42
NA,lation to minerals or timber but is a pastoral,42
NA,lease. It is not under any special sort of lease; it is,42
NA,not freehold ground. It is the same as very many,42
NA,other pastoral leases. It was purchased by the,42
NA,Aboriginal Land Trust as a pastoral lease and,42
NA,the agreement was signed on that basis. When,42
NA,we talk about the lack of satisfactory areas of,42
NA,land for Aboriginals in Western Australia we,42
NA,have to bear in mind that over 20 million hec-,42
NA,tares of land have been set aside as Aboriginal,42
NA,reserves in Western Australia. That figure does,42
NA,not include the pastoral leases and other tenures,42
NA,that have been set aside or purchased for Abor-,42
NA,iginals in that State.,42
NA,"It is significant, when the Opposition accuses",42
NA,this Government of having done nothing for the,42
NA,"Aboriginals in the way of land acquisition, to re-",42
NA,member that the Federal Government has spent,42
NA,$5m over the last five years in acquiring land for,42
NA,Aboriginals. We have gone about those acqui-,42
NA,sitions quite deliberately in an effort to upgrade,42
NA,the social fabric of the Aboriginal communities,42
NA,in isolated areas and to give them the oppor-,42
NA,have tunity of regaining their pride and of re-,42
NA,of establishing their communities. In some in-,42
NA,unstances they have surprised everybody by,42
NA,running their pastoral leases and other holdings,42
NA,economic grounds. It is fairly significant that,42
NA,Noonkanbah community has made great,42
NA,efforts in this regard. It has run its pastoral lease,42
NA,Their in a very commendable manner over recent,42
NA,It is also fairly significant that the trouble,42
NA,negoat Noonkanbah has been made much worse by,42
NA,that such people as the honourable member for Cun-,42
NA,Aboriginingham ( Mr West) and the honourable,42
NA,"for Fremantle who, in company with",42
NA,union representatives in Western Australia and,42
NA,"other people of that category, have been in the",42
NA,"Noonkanbah area stirring up the people, both",42
NA,"we white and Aboriginal, to the point where the cen-",42
NA,tral issues have been lost almost completely.,42
NA,"Mr Dawkins- I raise a point of order, Mr",42
NA,Deputy Speaker. I call on the honourable,42
NA,member for Kalgoorlie to withdraw that,42
NA,imputation.,42
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! The,42
NA,honourable member for Fremantle has not been,42
NA,given the call; he is making a point of order. The,42
NA,honourable member may put his point of order.,42
NA,Mr Dawkins- I seek a withdrawal. The,43
NA,honourable member for Kalgoorlie said that,43
NA,the honourable member for Cunningham and I,43
NA,have been in the Noonkanbah area stirring up,43
NA,trouble. That remark is completely untrue. I find,43
NA,it very offensive.,43
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,The honourable opinion.,43
NA,memberfindsthe remark offensive. The honourof,43
NA,able member for Kalgoorlie is required to,43
NA,withdraw.,43
Mr COTTER,I will withdraw the implihas,43
NA,cation that the honourable member for Frecent,43
NA,mantle has been stirring up trouble. I know that,43
NA,he is probably incapable of that sort of stirring.,43
NA,"reiterate that, by the honourable member",43
NA,"Cunningham's own admission, he and the and",43
NA,honourable member for Fremantle have been in,43
NA,the Noonkanbah area on two or three occasions. at,43
NA,They have been in the company of,43
NA,"Cook, the Trades and Labour Council leader in",43
NA,"Western Australia, and other union representa-",43
NA,tives. That is a published fact. By their own,43
NA,mission they have been there.,43
NA,"Mr West- I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy",43
NA,Speaker. I am very loth to take up the honouraccept,43
NA,"able member's time, but the point that has been",43
NA,made by the honourable member for Fremantle,43
NA,must be made again. The honourable member Western,43
NA,for Fremantle and I were invited there by,43
NA,management council of the station.,43
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr M i l l a r ) -,43
NA,Order! There is no point of order. The honourmunity.,43
NA,able member for Cunningham will resume his endorsed,43
NA,seat.,43
NA,Mr West- I was not there to stir up trouble,43
NA,but at the invitation of the station council.,43
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! The have made,43
NA,honourable member will resume his seat.,43
Mr COTTER,This only demonstrates the inplore,43
NA,ability of the honourable member for,43
NA,ningham to absorb even the English language. I,43
NA,withdrew the inference. I did not repeat that inis,43
NA,ference; I simply stated facts. It is quite clear,43
NA,the situation at Noonkanbah has to be sorted,43
NA,out. The questions raised at Noonkanbah are far,43
NA,bigger than just Noonkanbah. The problems will,43
NA,embrace the whole of Western Australia,43
NA,perhaps embrace the whole of Australia if they,43
NA,are not sorted out. It is quite clear that there,43
NA,real difference of opinion between the State,43
NA,Government and Commonwealth Government Affairs,43
NA,as to the responsibilities and the needs in that,43
NA,area. It is agreed that the sacred sites must be,43
NA,totally protected. That has been made quite clear,43
NA,on several occasions. It will be repeated again,43
NA,and again. Those sacred sites as delineated will,43
NA,not be alienated.,43
NA,There is some dispute on how large a sacred,43
NA,site is. There is also an agreement that the broad,43
NA,acres need not be protected. Even the respon-,43
NA,sible Aboriginals in that area are of the same,43
NA,It is fairly significant also that the areas,43
NA,the sacred sites do not correspond with lease,43
NA,boundaries whether they are pastoral lease,43
NA,boundaries or mining lease boundaries. But they,43
NA,"are sacred sites, and an unconditional guarantee",43
NA,been given that they will be protected. In re-,43
NA,times the issue of whether in fact the whole,43
NA,ofthe Noonkanbah pastoral lease should be pro-,43
NA,I tected has been raised. It has been made quite,43
NA,for clear by both the Commonwealth Government,43
NA,the State Government that special rights do,43
NA,not apply to pastoral leases. There is no question,43
NA,all that the protection of the sacred sites will be,43
NA,NA,43
NA,It is also fairly significant that when meetings,43
NA,adhave taken place an Noonkanbah recently Mr,43
NA,"Don MCLeod, who has resided at Strelley station",43
NA,"for some years, has been present. He is a well-",43
NA,known man who by his own admission does not,43
NA,the authority of the Commonwealth,43
NA,Government of Australia. He says that he does,43
NA,not accept the authority of the Government of,43
NA,Australia. It is fairly significant that Mr,43
NA,the Don MCLeod has been at Noonkanbah during,43
NA,discussions. A resident in the area has been act-,43
NA,ing in some capacity with the Noonkanbah com-,43
NA,He has very strong links indeed with an,43
NA,candidate for a seat in this House. It is,43
NA,also well known when we start talking about the,43
NA,electoral malpractices and possibilities of convic-,43
NA,"tions in that area that some of these people are,",43
NA,"in fact, very close to the Australian Labor Party. I",43
NA,it quite clear before today that I de-,43
NA,plore the actions of the person who took the for-,43
NA,tified wine to Turkey Creek just as much as I de-,43
NA,the actions ofthe persons very close to the,43
NA,CunLabor Party who have been accused of,43
NA,manipulating the vote in the last State election. It,43
NA,quite clear that the Labor Party is not prepared,43
NA,that to accept facts as they relate to those areas.,43
NA,This Government does not ignore the realities,43
NA,of the rights of Aboriginals. It has done more for,43
NA,and the Aboriginal communities throughout,43
NA,Australia than any government before it. In the,43
NA,is no Kimberley area the Aboriginals are on record as,43
NA,saying that the present Minister for Aboriginal,43
NA,(Senator Chaney) is a 'proper good Min-,43
NA,"ister, that one'. That is the sort of opinion they",43
NA,have of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. They,43
NA,treat him with a great deal of endearment and re-,43
NA,spect. They know the present Government Ims,43
NA,done more for the Aboriginals than any govern-,44
NA,ment before it. It is very significant indeed that,44
NA,"the AustraUan Labor Party, when in power,",44
NA,talked a lot and posed a lot but did nothing,44
NA,way of land rights for Aboriginals. It is sig-,44
NA,nificant also that it will be powerless to do,44
NA,thing in relation to land rights for Aboriginals,44
NA,it ever comes to power again.,44
NA,Features of the approach of the Liberalgested,44
NA,National Country Party Government to the Abon,44
NA,original land matters in the States are its recoghis,44
NA,nition of State constitutional responsibility,44
NA,"land administration, its assistance to Aboriginals",44
NA,through Aboriginal Land Fund Commission,44
NA,purchases and its consultations and negotiations,44
NA,with State governments seeking their support for,44
NA,Aboriginal land rights. This Government will,44
NA,run away from those responsibilities either now,44
NA,or in the future. As a prime,44
NA,seek a responsible settlement of the problem at,44
NA,Noonkanbah. An imposed settlement will not,44
NA,work. Unless it has the agreement of the people,44
NA,concerned and it is a settlement satisfactory to,44
NA,"the people there, it will not be a lasting settle-",44
NA,ment. I say again that the questions raised at,44
NA,Noonkanbah are far bigger than Noonkanbah.,44
NA,believe that the Western Australian,44
NA,and the Federal Government have a responsi-,44
NA,bility to ensure that a satisfactory settlement is,44
NA,reached.,44
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr MILLAR -,44
NA,Order! The honourable member's time has,44
NA,expired. The discussion is concluded.,44
NA,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,44
Mr WEST ,Cunningham)- I wish to make a,44
NA,personal explanation.,44
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Millar)-Does,44
NA,the honourable member claim to have been,44
NA,misrepresented?,44
Mr WEST,Yes . The honourable member for,44
NA,"Kalgoorlie ( Mr Cotter), on a number of",44
NA,occasions during the speech he has just,44
NA,"completed, alleged that the honourable member",44
NA,for Fremantle ( Mr Dawkins) and I were present,44
NA,at Noonkanbah on 2 and 19 April to stir up,44
NA,trouble among members of the Aboriginal com-,44
NA,munity. I want to make the point quite clear to,44
NA,the honourable member for Kalgoorlie-,44
NA,"Mr Cotter- I raise a point of order, Mr",44
NA,Deputy Speaker.,44
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,I think the matter,44
NA,has been satisfactorily resolved. Has the honour-,44
NA,able member for Cunninghamfinishedhis per-,44
NA,sonal explanation?,44
Mr WEST,No . I want to make it quite clear,44
NA,and place on record in Hansard that the honour-,44
NA,"able member for Fremantle and I were invited,",44
NA,"in the on both occasions, by the Kimberley Land",44
NA,Council and the Noonkanbah station man-,44
NA,any- agement council. The honourable member for,44
NA,if Kalgoorlie sent a telegram which was read out to,44
NA,the bush meeting held last Saturday. It,44
NA,apologised for his inability to be present and sug-,44
NA,that he would like to talk to those present,44
NA,a later occasion. I suggest to the House that,44
NA,whole approach to this matter has been hyp-,44
NA,for ocritical in the extreme.,44
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! The,44
NA,honourable member for Cunningham in turn,44
NA,offends against the Standing Orders. I must ask,44
NA,not the honourable member to withdraw the term,44
NA,that has been defined in this place previously as,44
NA,objective we must being offensive.,44
Mr WEST,I withdraw.,44

NA,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,45
NA,Motion (by Mr Eric Robinson) proposed:,45
NA,(1) That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as,45
NA,"would prevent the first order of the day, Government Busi-",45
NA,"ness, on Wednesday, 23 April, being 'Grievance' debate.",45
NA,(2) That Standing Orders 101 and 106 be read as if Wed-,45
NA,"nesday, 23 April, were an alternate",45
NA,Standing Order 106 would normally apply.,45
Mr HURFORD ,Adelaide) (4.48)-The Op-,45
NA,position supports this motion for the suspension,45
NA,of Standing Orders. We are glad that the,45
NA,"Government is not denying back benchers, and",45
NA,"indeed some members of the front bench, the op-",45
NA,portunity of speaking in the Grievance debate on,45
NA,Wednesday of this week instead of Thursday.,45
NA,Anzac Day has meant that the Parliament is sit-,45
NA,"ting Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday instead",45
NA,"of the normal Tuesday, Wednesday and Thurs-",45
NA,day. It is a delight for me that relationships have,45
NA,not broken down in relation to this matter as they,45
NA,did earlier in the day in relation to ministerial,45
NA,statements which were made in this Parliament. I,45
NA,"take the opportunity, as Manager of Opposition",45
NA,"Business in the House, to say that we will co-",45
NA,operate just as often as we can to facilitate the,45
NA,business of the House. When somebody as senior,45
NA,NA,45
NA,"seeks leave to make a statement, gets that leave,",45
NA,then seeks leave to make a further statement on,45
NA,the same matter and that leave is given to him on,45
NA,the understanding that he is making another,45
NA,"statement which was scheduled to be made, we",45
NA,would trust that the Opposition spokesman,45
NA,would be given a second chance to speak as well.,45
NA,It is despicable that that leave to speak was not,45
NA,Second Reading given to the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr,45
NA,Hayden) on that second occasion earlier this,45
NA,afternoon. The normal courtesies did not prevail.,45
NA,The Opposition believes and states that it is,45
NA,despicable.,45
NA,Mr Ruddock- I raise a point of order. I think,45
NA,that it is stretching the point of relevance to de-,45
NA,bate a matter of this sort when we are discussing,45
NA,the suspension of Standing Orders.,45
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Millar)-The,45
NA,Chair upholds the point of order. The honour-,45
NA,able member for Adelaide is rather extending,45
NA,the limits of the debate.,45
Mr HURFORD, I do not intend to do that,45
NA,"any longer. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know,",45
NA,this matter relates to the business of the House.,45
NA,"As I said in my introductory remarks, the Oppo-",45
NA,sition will always facilitate that business when it,45
NA,is reasonable. Something happened earlier today,45
NA,"which was not reasonable, and we all have",45
NA,occasion to say that that sort of thing should not,45
NA,"happen again, certainly from a person as senior",45
NA,as the Minister for Foreign Affairs.,45

NA,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL 1980,45
NA,"Bill presented by Mr Macphee, and read a",45
NA,first time.,45
NA,sitting Thursday to which,45
NA,Second Reading,45
Mr MACPHEE ,Balaclava-Minister for Im-,45
NA,migration and Ethnic Affairs) (4.51)- I move:,45
NA,That the Bill be now read a second time.,45
NA,The purpose of the Bill is to provide for two,45
NA,minor machinery amendments to the Migration,45
NA,Act 1958. The first is contained in clause 3 and,45
NA,amends the definitions of 'proclaimed airport',45
NA,and 'proclaimed port' in sub-section 5 (1) of the,45
NA,Migration Act. The amendment is necessary as a,45
NA,consequence of the provisions of clause 4 of the,45
NA,Customs Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1980 which,45
NA,replaces the concept of establishing ports and ap-,45
NA,pointing airports by proclamation with a system,45
NA,of appointments by the Minister.,45
NA,"Secondly, clause 4 of the Bill narrows one of",45
NA,the defences to an offence under sub-section,45
NA,11C(1) of the Migration Act committed by a,45
NA,carrier which brings persons to Australia without,45
NA,visas or return endorsements. Under the Act as,45
NA,presently drafted a carrier has a defence if he can,46
NA,establish that he had reasonable grounds for be-,46
NA,lieving that a person was not exempted from the,46
NA,need to obtain a visa or return endorsement. The,46
NA,amendment will limit the defence to establishing,46
NA,that he had reasonable grounds for believing,46
NA,that the person was exempt from the need to,46
NA,obtain a visa or return endorsement. I commend,46
NA,the Bill to the House.,46

NA,migration and Ethnic Affairs)- Mr Deputy,46
NA,"Speaker, may I have your indulgence to suggest",46
NA,that the House have a general debate covering,46
NA,this Bill and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill,46
NA,(No. 3) 1980 as they are associated measures.,46
NA,"Separate questions will, of course, be put on each",46
NA,of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate.,46
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Millar)-Is it,46
NA,the wish of the House to have a general debate,46
NA,covering the two measures? There being no,46
NA,"objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",46
Mr KEATING ,Blaxland) (4.53)-This is a,46
NA,cognate debate covering two Bills. The purpose,46
NA,of the Excise TariffAmendment Bill (No. 3) is to,46
NA,increase the price of oil and the purpose of the,46
NA,Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Grants) Bill is to de-,46
NA,crease the price of liquefied petroleum gas. It is a,46
NA,curious combination of legislation aimed at,46
NA,putting the price of one fuel up and the price of,46
NA,another fuel down. It shows the disarray of the,46
NA,Government's energy policies and the complete,46
NA,lack of co-ordination and direction with which,46
NA,Government energy policy is now being directed.,46
NA,I think it is fair to say that the Government's en-,46
NA,ergy policy is completely in tatters and in a state,46
NA,of utter confusion. The only basis of the Govern-,46
NA,ment's energy policy has essentially been higher,46
NA,petrol prices. Even this basis no longer exists. We,46
NA,have higher petrol prices but we are now to have,46
NA,"lower prices for liquefied petroleum gas, not just",46
NA,for household users-th e Opposition supports,46
NA,having lower prices for them-bu t for industry in,46
NA,general. The Government has said that liquefied,46
NA,petroleum gas is so valuable that it has to be,46
NA,"rationed by price, but it is going to ration it",46
NA,ducing the price. The price will be reduced by,46
NA,$50 to $ 100 a tonne less than it is at the moment.,46
NA,Quite obviously the whole rationale of the,46
NA,Government's pricing policy has disappeared.,46
NA,The Government has been stumping the country,46
NA,saying that Australia must have an opportunity,46
NA,cost energy pricing policy- a policy that must,46
NA,reflect the replacement cost of energy and the,46
NA,true world value of it. That is why we have a high,46
NA,oil price and that is why motorists have to pay,46
NA,through the nose at the petrol pumps. The,46
NA,Government says that its policy has been,46
NA,implemented to effect conservation and the use,46
NA,of substitute fuels. But as soon as that conser-,46
NA,"vation and substitution take place, the Govern-",46
NA,"ment immediately panics, drops its bundle and",46
NA,runs in with a subsidy to try to maintain its politi-,46
NA,Second Reading cal support.,46
NA,The Excise TariffAmendment Bill (No. 3) in-,46
NA,creases the government excise on Australian oil,46
NA,from $18.66 a barrel to $24.77-a n increase of,46
NA,over $6 a barrel. The Government has done this,46
NA,by increasing the excise from $16.25 a barrel to,46
NA,$22.27 a barrel. That increase was passed on to,46
NA,motorists in January this year. The Government,46
NA,lifted the price of petrol from 29'^c a litre to 34c,46
NA,a litre- a dramatic increase in price which,46
NA,"amounted to about 23c a gallon. So, to fill the av-",46
NA,erage tank of petrol one is talking about $3.50,46
NA,extra.,46
NA,The Bill validates the increase which was,46
NA,"passed on in January. But what we now realise,",46
NA,"of course, is that there is another $2 in the system",46
NA,which the Government has not passed on yet.,46
NA,Saudi Arabia increased the price of its oil by $2 a,46
NA,barrel and because the price of Australian oil is,46
NA,linked by the Fraser Government to the Saudi,46
NA,"Arabian price, the Fraser Government intends to",46
NA,"collect that $2 at some appropriate time. As well,",46
NA,we now have the prospect of an embargo on,46
NA,trade with Iran and the likelihood that oil which,46
NA,would normally flow between Iran and Japan,46
NA,"will be interrupted, in which case there will be",46
NA,pressure on prices from other suppliers of oil,46
NA,around the world.,46
NA,The likelihood is that the general level of oil,46
NA,prices will lift and from indications we have had,46
NA,"from a number of commentators on oil pricing,",46
NA,including the Saudi Arabian and Iranian oil Min-,46
NA,"isters, there will be dramatic increases in the",46
NA,posted price of Organisation of Petroleum,46
NA,Exporting Countries oil-Ara b oil-toward s the,46
NA,middle to the latter pan of this year. OPEC has a,46
NA,meeting in June and the Australian Government,46
NA,increases its oil prices on 1 July and I January,46
NA,"each year. So, by 1 July this year, the likelihood",46
NA,by reis that the Australian Government will impose,46
NA,another major tax slug on every Australian,46
NA,motorist at the petrol bowser because it will pass,46
NA,on the Saudi Arabian increases and the $2 in-,47
NA,crease which is in the system. If it does not pass,47
NA,"on the increase and takes a political approach,",47
NA,the whole rationale of its policy will fall to the,47
NA,ground. It cannot have it both ways. If it is going,47
NA,"to have an import parity pricing policy, it has to",47
NA,have import parity prices. It cannot have the pol-,47
NA,"icy without the prices; and if it tries that, it will be",47
NA,exposed for the sham with which it is associated.,47
NA,AustraUans should well understand that 93 per,47
NA,cent of their petrol comes from oil produced,47
NA,"Australia, that 67 per cent of Australia's oil",47
NA,"sumption is produced in Australia, that 93",47
NA,cent of that oil is produced in Bass Strait and that,47
NA,the cost of production of that oil is approximately,47
NA,$1 a barrel. So everything between $1 a barrel,47
NA,"and $25 a barrel, which is the price the Governparity,",47
NA,"ment is charging Australian refineries and hence,",47
NA,"Australian motorists, is fixed by the Fraser",47
NA,Government. Arabs canfixthe price of Arabian,47
NA,oil; only the Fraser Government canfixthe price,47
NA,of Australian oil. But the Fraser Government,47
NA,determined to fix the price of Australian oil,47
NA,Arab price and to collect the tax difference for,47
NA,"itself. This year, it will collect $2,500m more",47
NA,it was collecting two years ago. For this full,47
NA,year-rathe r than the currentfinancialyear-i,47
NA,"wiU collect $3,000m on current prices. Taking",47
NA,"into account the $3,000m crude oil levy plus the",47
NA,$956m the Government is already collecting via,47
NA,"the refined excise, or the pump tax which existed",47
NA,"before the crude oil levy, the total figure",47
NA,"$3,956m. So we find that the Fraser Governboys",47
NA,ment's increases on oil and petrol amount to a,47
NA,per cent increase in personal income tax receipts.,47
NA,This year the Commonwealth will collect,47
NA,revenue from oil and petroleum products than,47
NA,the total company tax receipts of the Com-,47
NA,"monwealth. So, together with the tax on the oil",47
NA,"companies, plus the excise on refined products,",47
NA,plus the pump tax-th e crude oil levy-th e totai,47
NA,increase amounts to an equivalent of 30 per,47
NA,pay-as-you-earn personal income tax receipts.,47
NA,What we have is a sleight of hand tax policy.,47
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) has estab-,47
NA,lished a branch of the Taxation Office at every,47
NA,petrol pump in the country. He is now slugging colleague.,47
NA,"Australians, not only through their pay packets",47
NA,with taxation but at the petrol pump. He is,47
NA,slugging them at the counters of the health insay-,47
NA,"surance funds. Previously, under a Labor",47
NA,"government, people were not billed separately",47
NA,"for health care. So looking at petrol alone, the",47
NA,policies of the Government to price Australian,47
NA,oil at the OPEC price has cost,47
NA,ist about $ 12 extra a week over the last two years.,47
NA,"In two years, petrol prices",47
NA,doubled and they will increase by much more,47
NA,"this year. Certainly, if AustraUa finds itself in the",47
NA,unfortunate circumstance of having the Fraser,47
NA,Government elected for yet another term of,47
NA,government-Go d help us-th e price of petrol in,47
NA,Australia will be so high as to be a usury tax on,47
NA,the public.,47
NA,"By contrast, the Labor Party's policy is to",47
NA,break this foolish link with OPEC prices for old,47
NA,"oil-tha t is, oil discovered in the early 1970s and",47
NA,in which is being produced out of Bass Strait. By,47
NA,conbreaking this nexus-thi s automatic link- a,47
NA,per Labor government would freeze the price of,47
NA,Australian oil for its first 12 months of office and,47
NA,then adjust the price moderately in line with in-,47
NA,creases in the consumer price index or import,47
NA,whichever is the lesser. The effect would,47
NA,be that Australian prices would rise by only,47
NA,about 8 per cent or 9 per cent after a 12 months',47
NA,freeze. Over the life of a parliament-abou t 3,47
NA,years-petro l prices under a Labor government,47
NA,is would be dramatically lower than they would be,47
NA,at the under the Fraser Government; so much so that,47
NA,the price of a gallon of petrol could be anything,47
NA,than up to 40 per cent cheaper. The Fraser Govern-,47
NA,ment has developed what it thought to be a very,47
NA,t smart sleight of hand tax. The Prime Minister,47
NA,thought that the public was so stupid that it,47
NA,would never wake up to the fact that it was not,47
NA,the Arabs who were putting up the oil price but,47
NA,that it was the Fraser Government itself putting,47
NA,is up the price and using the Arabs as whipping,47
NA,for the policy which it had implemented.,47
NA,23 There is no reason why Australians should have,47
NA,the benefit of an oil field in their own backyard.,47
NA,This does not cut across any policy about explo-,47
NA,more ration because exploration in Australia runs,47
NA,under a completely different policy altogether.,47
NA,My colleague in another place the Minister for,47
NA,National Development and Energy (Senator,47
NA,Carrick) makes the fallacious claim-th e false,47
NA,cent claim-a t every turn that under Labor petrol,47
NA,would dry up at the bowsers because exploration,47
NA,The would stop. That is just so much nonsense.,47
Mr HURFORD ,"H e is an opponent, not a",47
Mr KEATING,H e is a parliamentary col-,47
NA,also league and a poor opponent. One might just,47
NA,Mr Hodges-Wha t happened-,47
Mr KEATING,Wh y don't you crawl back,47
NA,the average motorinto your hole?,47
NA,Mr Hodges-Tel l us what happened between,47
NA,in Australia have 1972 and 1975.,47
Mr KEATING, I will tell the honourable,48
NA,member what happened between 1972 and,48
NA,1975. During the three years of Labor total ex-,48
NA,ploration expenditure in 1974-75 constant prices,48
NA,was $263m. During the first three years of Fraser,48
NA,"Government it was $193m. So, in other words,",48
NA,there has been a dramatic decline in the dollars,48
NA,outlayed in exploration in the first three years of,48
NA,the Fraser Government. Let me give the,48
NA,interjector-,48
NA,Mr Hodges-Yo u know that that is not right.,48
NA,Don't quote false figures.,48
Mr KEATING,The y are not false. They are,48
NA,figures from the Australian Statistician. In the,48
NA,three years of Labor 146 wells were drilled; in,48
NA,the first three years of the Liberals 94 wells were,48
NA,"drilled. Last year, total exploration expenditure",48
NA,"was $ 190m, that is, $70m less than in the amount",48
NA,"spent under the Labor Government. So, the",48
NA,honourable member should not raise that matter,48
NA,again. The issue is simply that both major parties,48
NA,support the payment to oil companies of the full,48
NA,world price for oil yet to be discovered. It comes,48
NA,under the newfieldspolicy which was introduced,48
NA,by the Whitlam Government in September 1975,48
NA,and has been continued by this Government.,48
NA,That is the policy under which exploration in,48
NA,Australia continues to operate. We promise to,48
NA,"pay the world price, import parity, for oil yet to",48
NA,be discovered. But the debate about petrol prices,48
NA,in Australia at the moment is one not about new,48
NA,oil or exploration. Rather it is about old oil-oi l,48
NA,"discovered, under the technical definition, before",48
NA,"14 September 1975, Essentially that oil was dis-",48
NA,covered in 1968 in Bass Strait off the coast of,48
NA,Gippsland in Victoria. Production in those fields,48
NA,began in 1970 and has continued. I repeat that,48
NA,that oil is produced at a cost of about $ 1 a barrel.,48
NA,In the seven years 1970-77 the price of Bass,48
NA,Strait oil to Austrahan refineries was $2.33 a,48
NA,"rel until 1974, and then $4.33 a barrel",48
NA,1977. All of a sudden it has become $25 a barrel.,48
NA,"Thus, it has increased from $4.33 a barrel to $25",48
NA,a barrel. One may well ask why that is so? The,48
NA,answer is that Mr Fraser has his greedy hand in,48
NA,the public till of Australia. He is reefing it from,48
NA,the motorist at every opportunity so that he can,48
NA,have some soft tax options in funding the public,48
NA,"deficit, without resorting to other direct taxation",48
NA,measures for which he would be caned. 1 ask,48
NA,honourable members to imagine the reaction of,48
NA,the AustraUan public to a Prime Minister's seekgive,48
NA,ing a 23 per cent increase in personal income,48
NA,He would be thrown out of office at the first,48
NA,portunity. But that is what the Fraser,48
NA,ment has done. It has increased personal tax-,48
NA,ation by 23 per cent merely by increasing the tax,48
NA,on petrol at the pump. Every family with a motor,48
NA,car has been affected dramatically by these,48
NA,increases.,48
NA,But that policy does not touch exploration.,48
NA,The companies which are exploring for oil in,48
NA,"Australia include Shell, BP Australia Ltd, Mt Isa",48
NA,"Mines, Hudson Bay Oil and Gas, Canadian Su-",48
NA,"perior, and the Australian Oil and Gas Corpor-",48
NA,ation Ltd. None of these companies produces oil,48
NA,"in Australia. Therefore, none of them can get one",48
NA,dollar under the oil policy. They are not pro-,48
NA,"ducers. Therefore, the hollow claim of the",48
NA,Government that high oil prices are needed in,48
NA,order to keep exploration under way is absol-,48
NA,utely arrant nonsense. No stimulus to explo-,48
NA,"ration is provided from the old oil revenue,",48
NA,which virtually goes straight to the Government.,48
NA,The only companies to receive any of it are Esso,48
NA,"and BHP, in relation to theirfieldsin Bass Strait.",48
NA,The drilling that is proceeding from ships at,48
NA,the North West Shelf in Western Australia has,48
NA,been undertaken in the main by companies,48
NA,which currently are not producers of oil and gas,48
NA,"in Australia. Therefore, they receive not one red",48
NA,cent from the proceeds of the old oil policy. That,48
NA,is just a furphy put out by the Government. It,48
NA,well knows that its promise-an d that ofthe Aus-,48
NA,tralian Labor Party-t o pay to oil companies the,48
NA,world price for oil as yet undiscovered is a very,48
NA,generous one. Not many countries offer to oU ex-,48
NA,ploration companies the import parity price as,48
NA,the cost of production. The only difference be-,48
NA,tween the Government's policy and that of,48
NA,Labor is that the Government offers that return,48
NA,subject to company tax only and the Opposition,48
NA,would offer it subject to both company tax and a,48
NA,"resources rent tax. In that way, we could have the",48
NA,best of both worlds-th e benefit of lower prices,48
NA,for oil discovered a decade ago and of maintain-,48
NA,baring the stimulus for exploration that is provided,48
NA,until about under the new oil policy.,48
NA,One may well ask why we should pay a high,48
NA,price for petrol when we do not pay it also for,48
NA,"gas, coal or electricity. The price of gas into Mel-",48
NA,"bourne is some $3 a barrel, oil equivalent, com-",48
NA,pared with $25 a barrel for oil. The price into,48
NA,"Sydney is akin to thatfigure.Again, the prices of",48
NA,our electricity do not reflect the ruling steaming,48
NA,"coal prices on world markets, which are higher.",48
NA,"In other words, as a nation we have decided to",48
NA,consumers the benefit ofthe resources of the,48
NA,tax. country and to allow our industries to operate,48
NA,opwith the competitive advantage of having avail-,48
NA,Governable indigenous fuel sources.,48
NA,The Government wants to break that policy in,48
NA,"respect of petrol only and, as a result, we must",48
NA,pay the world price for it. The Government,49
NA,claims that this is good energy economics. The,49
NA,truth is that the Government introduced the,49
NA,"crude oil pricing policy, which raises the price to",49
NA,"the world level, so that it would have easy assess",49
NA,to a block of taxation that would not otherwise,49
NA,"be available to it. One would think that, if the",49
NA,"Government received $2,500m in energy tax-",49
NA,"ation from petrol, it would devote some of it to",49
NA,"the task of finding more energy, but not one dol-",49
NA,lar of the sum collected at the petrol pump goes,49
NA,back into the direct search for oil and gas. Under,49
NA,"Labor, by way of the Australian Hydrocarbon",49
NA,"Corporation, a government-owned oil company,",49
NA,some of that money would be channelled back,49
NA,into the direct search for oil and gas. People may,49
NA,say: 'You do not need this. The private explo-,49
NA,ration effort is sufficient to look after our energy,49
NA,independence'.,49
NA,I ask: What is the private exploration effort,49
NA,doing this year? It will consist of the drilling of,49
NA,"holes, compared with 3,000 in Canada. This year",49
NA,"some $ 190m will be spent on exploration, a sum",49
NA,which equals 8 per cent of the revenue from,49
NA,"crude oil levy. Thus, if we spent on exploration",49
NA,just 8 per cent of the massive tax harvest that,49
NA,Commonwealth reaps at the petrol pump we permitting,49
NA,would duplicate the current expenditure on pricoveries.,49
NA,vate exploration in Australia. If one includes the,49
NA,"total Commonwealth revenue from petrol, oil",49
NA,"and petroleum products, an expenditure on ex-",49
NA,ploration of $ 190m this year would equal but 5 country,49
NA,"per cent of that sum. Thus, if we were to spend",49
NA,"just 5 per cent of it, through a government",49
NA,"poration, upon exploration, either exclusively",49
NA,jointly with private industry in the search for,49
NA,and gas we would duplicate the total exploration,49
NA,effort.,49
NA,"What worries me is that, if the deep water",49
NA,program that is currently being undertaken,49
NA,the coast of Western Australia fails to produce a,49
NA,"major oil field within the next 12 or 15 months,",49
NA,the major drilling program that is now being,49
NA,mounted will be cancelled immediately and,49
NA,abandoned. About $90m of the $190m autowith,49
NA,matically will be withdrawn from the exploSenator,49
NA,"ration budget for the following year. Therefore,",49
NA,"Australia could be left in the parlous position,",49
NA,"when its old oil reserves were running down,",49
NA,having the big international companies pull out,49
NA,of the serious search for hydrocarbons in deep,49
NA,water and spend their exploration budgets off the,49
NA,"coast of Vietnam, China or Indonesia. Ausprices",49
NA,tralians cannot explore off the coast of China.,49
NA,live here and therefore must,49
NA,What ideas has the Government for increasing,49
NA,"the exploration effort? Indeed, what ideas has the",49
NA,"industry for increasing exploration? Recently, I",49
NA,went to the Australian Petroleum Exploration,49
NA,Association conference. Papers were delivered,49
NA,about ethanol production and about methanol,49
NA,production. It was all very interesting but no one,49
NA,spoke about how we were to increase the,49
NA,"national exploration effort. Certainly, no one in",49
NA,the Government has any ideas about it. The only,49
NA,organisation to present an idea was the Labor,49
NA,Party.,49
NA,I made the proposal that we ought to have a,49
NA,government corporation and spend some of the,49
NA,huge amount of energy revenue on energy explo-,49
NA,"ration, not just have it go into the Fraser Govern-",49
NA,"ment's coffers, from which it can be spread",49
NA,across the general appropriation or used to give,49
NA,the Government soft options on borrowings or,49
NA,the imposition of taxation. I suggested that some,49
NA,of it should be returned to the search for oil and,49
NA,gas in order to guarantee our energy indepen-,49
NA,59 dence. That has not happened and it is not likely,49
NA,to happen under the Fraser Government because,49
NA,of its ideological hangup that it does not want,49
NA,the Government corporations doing anything. I,49
NA,would not want that either if private companies,49
NA,the reacted appropriately to the generous offer of,49
NA,the import parity price for new dis-,49
NA,But that is not happening. The explo-,49
NA,ration effort is far too small and we are now com-,49
NA,pelled to do what nearly every other major,49
NA,has done. Britain with the British,49
NA,National Oil Corporation has established its own,49
NA,"public corporation. Canada has Petrocanada,",49
NA,"corNorway has Statoil, Indonesia has Pertomina,",49
NA,or Italy has Ente Nazionale Idrocarbure-an d,49
NA,oil Australia will have the Australian Hydrocarbon,49
NA,Corporation. Woe betide the tories in this,49
NA,country if they try to block this proposal in the,49
NA,Senate. It will become the law of the land and,49
NA,"off will be, I think, a successful organisation.",49
NA,Let me just return to the issue of price. I have,49
NA,"demonstrated that the old oil price, the price we",49
NA,"pay for petrol at the pumps, has nothing to do",49
NA,exploration. That is just a figment of,49
NA,Carrick's imagination. He knows as well,49
NA,as I know that it has nothing to do with explo-,49
NA,ration. He uses this technique only as a sort of,49
NA,of Joseph Goebbels technique-tel l a lie often,49
NA,enough and people will believe it-i n the hope,49
NA,that the public will get the wrong impression by,49
NA,being led to understand that we need high petrol,49
NA,to keep exploration running. It is a non-,49
NA,We sense proposal and does not stand up to any,49
NA,find oil in Australia. scrutiny.,49
Mr HURFORD ,I t is a smokescreen.,49
Mr KEATING,Absolutely. It is a smoke-,50
NA,screen. Why then do we need high petrol prices?,50
NA,The truth is that we do not. A Labor government,50
NA,"would freeze the price for 12 months, break the",50
NA,nexus with import parity and adjust the price,50
NA,with movements in the consumer price index so,50
NA,that Australians will have the benefit of lower,50
NA,petrol prices than they would otherwise have,50
NA,under the Fraser Government.,50
NA,I turn now to liquefied petroleum gas because,50
NA,one Bill being debated in this cognate debate is,50
NA,the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Grants) Bill.,50
NA,When we talk of liquefied petroleum gas we are,50
NA,talking essentially about butane and propane.,50
NA,These two products are produced at refineries in,50
NA,Australia and are also naturally occurring prod-,50
NA,ucts in the Bass Strait oil producing areas. We,50
NA,produce roughly two million tonnes of LPG a,50
NA,"year and we consume about 400,000 tonnes. The",50
NA,"rest is exported to Japan. The Government, in",50
NA,"the last 12 months, has dramatically increased",50
NA,the price of liquefied petroleum gas. About a,50
NA,year ago the price of liquefied petroleum gas was,50
NA,about $88 a tonne. It has now gone up to $252 a,50
NA,tonne. One may ask how this has happened.,50
NA,Essentially it has happened in this way: After the,50
NA,Iranian revolution there was a cutback in Iranian,50
NA,oil production and the glut of oil which had been,50
NA,evident in the world for a couple of years before,50
NA,that time disappeared. A premium was being,50
NA,paid in the spot market for oil and other pet-,50
NA,roleum products. The Organisation of Petroleum,50
NA,Exporting Countries seized that opportunity to,50
NA,give liquefied petroleum gas the status of a full,50
NA,commodity and to price it appropriately on its,50
NA,"British thermal unit heat equivalent, or its energy",50
NA,component. A result was that the price of,50
NA,liquefied petroleum gas has increased dramati-,50
NA,cally in the last 15 to 18 months. The Fraser,50
NA,Government decided to price liquefied pet-,50
NA,roleum gas at export parity. It decided to charge,50
NA,Australians the price for which Esso-BHP paid,50
NA,for the export of LPG from Australia. Because,50
NA,Esso-BHP was selling into the world market by,50
NA,"selling to Japan, the price it was receiving started",50
NA,to rise as the world market price rose. The result,50
NA,was that our domestic price rose with those,50
NA,increases.,50
NA,Mr Jacobi-Nothin g to do with production at,50
NA,all.,50
Mr KEATING,Nothin g to do with pro-,50
NA,"duction costs at all, because essentially LPG",50
NA,from Bass Strait is produced for nothing. It is,50
NA,produced as a by-product and is exported. The,50
NA,refineries collect their profits and costs across,50
NA,their other products. Liquefied petroleum gas,50
NA,was the sort of sawdust in the system and it was,50
NA,priced at whatever the oil companies could get,50
NA,for it. All of a sudden the price skyrocketed to,50
NA,$252 a tonne for propane and about $290 for,50
NA,"butane. The result was that consumers, particu-",50
NA,larly country consumers hooked up to a liquefied,50
NA,"petroleum gas reticulation system, found all of a",50
NA,sudden that their energy bills were skyrocketing,50
NA,because of this 350 per cent increase in the price,50
NA,in 12 months. Because the country towns with,50
NA,reticulated systems are in National Country,50
NA,"Party electorates, Country Party members of",50
NA,course hit the panic button. They do not mind,50
NA,having opportunity cost pricing as long as it does,50
NA,not hurt them. They do not mind the rhetoric,50
NA,about rational energy pricing as long as it does,50
NA,not affect their votes. But when it starts to affect,50
NA,their votes they pull out all stops to save them-,50
NA,selves at the next election. They pressured the,50
NA,Government to introduce a subsidy and to re-,50
NA,duce the price.,50
NA,The Government introduced a subsidy of $80,50
NA,a tonne. Because we on this side of the House be-,50
NA,lieved the price should never have gone up in the,50
NA,"first place, we supported the subsidy. But we do",50
NA,not support the subsequent policy of the Govern-,50
NA,"ment, which was simply to pull thefigureof $205",50
NA,a tonne out of the air and to make that the price,50
NA,"of LPG in Australia, without distinguishing be-",50
NA,tween butane and propane. The price is $205 a,50
NA,"tonne, whereas it was $252 for propane and $290",50
NA,for butane. The Government has reduced those,50
NA,prices by between $50 and $90. People ask: How,50
NA,can the Government make water run uphill?,50
NA,How can it reduce the price in this way? It did a,50
NA,dirty deal with the oil companies. It said to the oil,50
NA,companies: 'You will receive only $205 a tonne.,50
NA,To cover any losses you may have as a result you,50
NA,can apply to the Prices Justification Tribunal for,50
NA,increases in the prices of other petroleum prod-,50
NA,"ucts such as petrol, kerosene, distillate and all the",50
NA,other things you sell. We will grant the increases.,50
NA,"In other words, we will pretend that we are giv-",50
NA,"ing the public some benefit, but we will not really",50
NA,be doing so. We will just reduce the price of LPG,50
NA,"and put up the price of petrol, distillate and",50
NA,kerosene'.,50
NA,The oil companies said: 'We do not like it. It is,50
NA,"a bad policy, but at least we will not lose. All",50
NA,"right, we will shut up about it and do that'. The",50
NA,Government then invited the companies to apply,50
NA,"for increases in prices of petrol, kerosene, distil-",50
NA,"lates, naphtha and other such products. The PJT",50
NA,granted the increases. But now the companies,50
NA,all are in trouble because the New South Wales,50
NA,Government will not allow those increases to be,50
NA,passed on in New South Wales. Good on it. Why,50
NA,should it? Why should it facilitate the dirty deal-,51
NA,ings of the Fraser Government with the oil,51
NA,"companies to increase the prices of kerosene, pet-",51
NA,"rol, distillates, naphtha and other such products",51
NA,to disguise its policy on liquefied petroleum gas?,51
NA,A furphy is being put across by Senator Carrick,51
NA,to people in industry and in rural New South,51
NA,Wales and Victoria. He is saying that the,51
NA,Government has reduced the price of LPG. All it,51
NA,has done has made every other motorist and con-,51
NA,"sumer of kerosene; petrol, distillates or naphtha",51
NA,pay for the increases. I do not think there is any,51
NA,honesty in that approach.,51
NA,"By contrast, what is the approach of the",51
NA,Party? What we have said is that when we are in,51
NA,government we will make the Prices Justification,51
NA,Tribunal price liquefied petroleum gas on the,51
NA,basis of the costed production price ruling,51
NA,the export parity policy was adopted. All the,51
NA,sequent increases in refinery costs will be added,51
NA,to that base price. Under that,51
NA,price which would now prevail would be about,51
NA,"$209 a tonne. In other words, we would have a",51
NA,price which was based upon production cost,51
NA,"cost of recovery, not on some imagined price",51
NA,which is plucked out of the atmosphere by the,51
NA,Government to suit its political convenience. The,51
NA,important distinction is that the price determined,51
NA,by the Government's LPG policy will rise with,51
NA,the price of oil. Because the Government is comLPG,51
NA,mitted to import parity pricing for oil in Australia,51
NA,and because refineries in Australia-,51
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Hon. Ian,51
NA,Robinson)-Order ! The honourable member's,51
NA,time has expired.,51
Mr GOODLUCK ,Franklin) (5.24)-The two,51
NA,Bills before the House are of major significance,51
NA,and importance to this nation. The first is,51
NA,Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Grants) Bill and the,51
NA,second is the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No.,51
NA,3). The Minister for Business and Consumer,51
NA,Affairs ( Mr Garland) indicated in his second,51
NA,reading speech that liquefied petroleum gas will,51
NA,be a viable alternative to petrol. I intend,51
NA,afternoon to confine most of my remarks to LPG,51
NA,and to how people can be encouraged to use,51
NA,LPG as an alternative fuel. I hope to explain,51
NA,many concerned people in Australia how it can,51
NA,be used and how its use can be encouraged. The,51
NA,"world is facing an energy crisis and, unless",51
NA,tive action is taken by the Government to,51
NA,courage the rational use of our natural energy,51
NA,"sources, Australia may experience shortages and",51
NA,hardships similar to those now being expericase.,51
NA,enced by other countries. For this reason the,51
NA,Government has formulated a policy of encourthe,51
NA,aging the use of LPG as u means ol'reducing,51
NA,"dependence on imported oil, particularly in areas",51
NA,where LPG has premium value such as in,51
NA,automotive use.,51
NA,I believe LPG can be a successful alternative,51
NA,to petrol power driven motor vehicles. There will,51
NA,be a reduction in the price of propane and,51
NA,butane to a common maximum price of $205 per,51
NA,tonne other than for petrochemical and non-,51
NA,traditional industrial uses. This means that the,51
NA,price of propane will be reduced by about 20 per,51
NA,cent and the price of butane will be reduced by,51
NA,about 30 per cent. The new price will provide ap-,51
NA,proximately a 50 per cent price differential be-,51
NA,Labor tween LPG and motor spirit in the Melbourne,51
NA,reference market and will provide a major incen-,51
NA,"tive towards the use of LPG in motor vehicles,",51
NA,especially in the case of fleet owners. I remind,51
NA,before the House that many taxi firms throughout,51
NA,subAustralia have heeded the warning and have,51
NA,already successfully converted most of their ve-,51
NA,arrangement the hicles to LPG.,51
NA,Conversion to LPG is not something new.,51
NA,or Many European countries have had LPG,51
NA,equipped vehicles for about 25 years. For,51
NA,"example, Holland has on its roads 250,000 ve-",51
NA,hicles converted to run on LPG. Because of a de-,51
NA,pendence on imported crude products many of,51
NA,Japan's taxis and private vehicles are fitted for,51
NA,"use. Japan, incidentally, imports most of its",51
NA,LPG from Australia. This country has proven,51
NA,"that LPG fuelled cars can be reliable, safe and",51
NA,successful.,51
NA,The Government must do several things to,51
NA,entice and encourage people in Australia to con-,51
NA,vert to LPG. First of all I believe we must direct a,51
NA,campaign not only atfleetowners but also at the,51
NA,ordinary car users of Australia telling them pre-,51
NA,the cisely the advantages and the disadvantages of,51
NA,LPG. Many people have an inherent fear of the,51
NA,"use of LPG. This, of course, can be refuted by the",51
NA,success of its use in Japan and European coun-,51
NA,"tries. Of course, when a dog bites a man very few",51
NA,people take notice. But when a man bites a dog,51
NA,this everybody sits up and takes notice. For that,51
NA,reason I believe we need to conduct a campaign,51
NA,to tell the people of Australia that LPG can be a,51
NA,"to successful, safe and very viable alternative.",51
NA,To me there seems to be a pessimistic attitude,51
NA,posito LPG. We have read of an accident in New,51
NA,enSouth Wales in which a car using LPG was in-,51
NA,revolved in an explosion. We feel sorry for the,51
NA,people who were injured. But this is an isolated,51
NA,People should be informed of the success of,51
NA,LPG in other countries. I believe for that reason,51
NA,Government has been very remiss. We,51
NA,our indicated that wc hoped many people in,51
NA,Australia would convert to LPG. But I am afraid,52
NA,we did not come up with a successful campaign,52
NA,"to be directed at the car owners of Australia, the",52
NA,"car users of Australia, to use LPG.",52
NA,It takes about nine hours to convert a normal,52
NA,motor vehicle to LPG. Most modern motor ve-,52
NA,"hicles can be converted. Installers, of course, are",52
NA,becoming very efficient. The legitimate ones are,52
NA,now licensed. I believe that all installers in every,52
NA,State will have to be licensed in the near future.,52
NA,"Of course, if we are to ask people to convert we",52
NA,need to make absolutely certain that they will be,52
NA,protected. Installers use mainly four basic com-,52
NA,ponents to set up their new system- a steel fuel,52
NA,tank made to specification and generally located,52
NA,"in the boot, a fuel lock filter, a converter and a",52
NA,"gas carburettor. It is a simple process and, of",52
NA,"course, with experience and know-how it is being",52
NA,"improved every day. Of course, many legitimate",52
NA,dealers are starting up all over Australia. I be-,52
NA,lieve the thrust of the Government should be,52
NA,directed at encouraging and enticing people to,52
NA,convert their motor vehicles to LPG use.,52
NA,There are advantages and there are disadvant-,52
NA,ages in the use of LPG. I would like to outline,52
NA,some of the advantages and disadvantages. One,52
NA,"advantage is that there are no lead, carbon or",52
NA,sludge formations on the valves or on any com-,52
NA,bustion chamber. There is no oil dilution. The,52
NA,engine runs up to three times longer without re-,52
NA,quiring an overhaul. There is no oil contami-,52
NA,"nation, no cylinder wash down and no crank case",52
NA,oil dilution. Oil stays clean and maintains its,52
NA,lubricating properties five or six times longer.,52
NA,Consequently there is a reduction in the number,52
NA,"of oil changes and, as a result, there will be a",52
NA,duction in the amount of oil used throughout,52
NA,Australia.,52
NA,"In addition, a fuel pump is not needed because",52
NA,LPG generates its own pressure. Consequently,52
NA,there is a reduction in the amount of work,52
NA,"required to be carried out, such as in the",52
NA,overhauling of fuel pumps and so on. Spark,52
NA,plugs last four or five times longer and perform,52
NA,at peak efficiency most of the time because with,52
NA,clean-burning LPG there are no deposits. There,52
NA,are savings also in relation to replacement of,52
NA,"parts, maintenance and labour. Of course, carbu-",52
NA,rettors do not get gummed up and for that reason,52
NA,the periodic replacement of parts is eliminated. If,52
NA,a car converted to LPG is tuned and adjusted,52
NA,"correctly the engine will run quietly, smoothly",52
NA,"and efficiently. The performance of the car is, of",52
NA,"course, completely dependent on the person who",52
NA,carries out the conversion. If the work is done by,52
NA,a skilled person to specification the owner can,52
NA,rest assured there will be no problems.,52
NA,I shall now deal with some of the disadvant-,52
NA,ages of LPG use. A lot is said today about LPG.,52
NA,Many people who condemn its use do not know,52
NA,very much about it.,52
Mr SHIPTON ,Yo u can do mine.,52
Mr GOODLUCK,If I could do the honour-,52
NA,"able member's conversion, I would. The disad-",52
NA,vantages can be confined to three or four in,52
NA,"number. First, there is a reduction in power, par-",52
NA,"ticularly in top gear and, of course, this happens",52
NA,mostly out on the open road. The loss of power is,52
NA,predicted at around 10 per cent to 15 per cent.,52
NA,"Secondly, there are problems with the number of",52
NA,"filling stations and, of course, there are problems",52
NA,"with filling the tank with LPG. However, I am",52
NA,hopeful that as LPG becomes a more accepted,52
NA,alternative more filling stations will supply this,52
NA,product and consequently filling a car with LPG,52
NA,will be easier and a far more efficient operation.,52
NA,"Thirdly, there have been certain problems with",52
NA,"valve seating, but I believe that is only the result",52
NA,of incomplete and incompetent adjustment when,52
NA,"the original equipment is fitted. Of course, the",52
NA,fitting of the tank sometimes creates a few prob-,52
NA,lems in terms of boot size but I believe that in the,52
NA,long term with the help of car manufacturers,52
NA,they also can be overcome.,52
NA,I believe that with a more vigorous marketing,52
NA,approach more cars could be converted to LPG.,52
NA,I believe the process can be simplified and the,52
NA,cost of conversion can be reduced. As a conse-,52
NA,quence I believe more people may be,52
NA,encouraged to convert to LPG. To me conversion,52
NA,to LPG is a sensible alternative. It could be very,52
NA,attractive because if there were a shortage of pet-,52
NA,rerol one could switch to the use of LPG. I believe,52
NA,with a far greater and more vigorous approach,52
NA,we could increase the demand for LPG and en-,52
NA,courage the building of a greater number of,52
NA,outlets.,52
NA,We could encourage people to convert to the,52
NA,"dual system, meaning that they could with the",52
NA,flick of a lever run their cars on either petrol or,52
NA,LPG. Surely this is something that we should be,52
NA,encouraging car manufacturers to do. If they can,52
NA,"offer options on gear boxes, differentials, uphol-",52
NA,"stery, seating and so on we should be asking",52
NA,them to manufacture motor vehicles that can be,52
NA,converted quite easily to LPG.,52
NA,Mr Jacobi-O r to petrochemicals.,52
Mr GOODLUCK,Certainly. I have been a,52
NA,strong advocate of the proposition that car,52
NA,manufacturers should be able to manufacture a,52
NA,motor either to be driven by petrol or to be pow-,52
NA,ered by LPG. I believe that they should offer this,52
NA,as an alternative. They should offer an LPG,52
NA,powered motor vehicle as an option. They can,53
NA,"offer options on differentials, gear boxes and so",53
NA,"on, so why should they not be able to produce a",53
NA,motor vehicle that can be run on either petrol or,53
NA,LPG? Government incentives should be offered,53
NA,to manufacturers to experiment on these very im-,53
NA,portant alternatives. If that were done I believe,53
NA,in the near future the number of motor vehicles,53
NA,predicted to convert to LPG use-i t is about 12,53
NA,per cent or 14 per cent-woul d increase greatly.,53
NA,This would mean that the amount of petrol being,53
NA,burned in some of the larger and more inefficient,53
NA,motor vehicles in Australia today would be,53
NA,reduced.,53
NA,Some problems exist. I earnestly ask the,53
NA,Government to look at them very seriously.,53
NA,"Sometimes, because of change, it is very easy to",53
NA,"say that we will do this or we will do that, but we",53
NA,need stricter regulations on conversion tech-,53
NA,niques. At the moment there is a lack of unifor-,53
NA,mity among the States regarding registration and,53
NA,licensing of premises and operators. There is a,53
NA,"lack of availability of tanks, conversion kits and",53
NA,ancillary fittings and a lack of Australian gearing,53
NA,or know-how to produce kits and associated,53
NA,fittings. Why should we import most of our kits?,53
NA,Surely companies such as Repco- I believe it is,53
NA,already interested-ca n produce those kits and,53
NA,subsequently reduce the cost to the normal,53
NA,motorist of Australia.,53
NA,At one stage in Victoria there was,53
NA,"of some 26,000 for conversion. I believe the cata-",53
NA,lyst for the conversions in Australia was the Gas,53
NA,and Fuel Corporation of Victoria. I believe it has,53
NA,done an excellent job in encouraging people in,53
NA,Victoria to convert to LPG use. Sometimes there,53
NA,is a shortage of inner tanks and V8 conversion,53
NA,"kits. If we ask people to convert, we must make",53
NA,absolutely certain that the people who do the job,53
NA,have every encouragement and have every op-,53
NA,portunity to do it. I realise that there is a great,53
NA,concern to have licensing and inspection ar-,53
NA,rangements. Some States have just started to in-,53
NA,"troduce stringent legislation, which we need.",53
NA,People at this moment are frightened because of,53
NA,some of the things that are being circulated,53
NA,"within the community, to the extent that they will",53
NA,not convert. Safety is a prerequisite and we must,53
NA,make absolutely certain that the people who will,53
NA,do the conversions know how to do them and,53
NA,will do them according to the regulations.,53
NA,All conversion kits are presently imported. I,53
NA,mentioned that we need to encourage the manu-,53
NA,facture of those kits in Australia. Why should we,53
NA,be dependent on other countries producing those,53
NA,kits? The firms involved make their normal,53
NA,profit. We should be producing those kits in,53
NA,Australia. I believe we could offer an alternative,53
NA,far cheaper than that being offered by some of,53
NA,the dealers throughout Australia today. Conver-,53
NA,"sion cost has increased from $300 to $400, from",53
NA,$400 to $500 and I believe that it is now some-,53
NA,times as much as $900 a car. If we ask people to,53
NA,convert we must make absolutely certain they get,53
NA,the best possible price-no t necessarily the,53
NA,"cheapest-an d that they get a safe, reliable job.",53
NA,The Government should aim for that. It is also an,53
NA,objective of my Government to convert 14 per,53
NA,cent of all motor vehicles to LPG use. Assistance,53
NA,must be given to all people if they are to convert,53
NA,at our request. If we ask people to convert we,53
NA,need to make certain that they get every assist-,53
NA,ance. I hope that all members ofthe House will,53
NA,work toward that one achievement. If we ask,53
NA,that people accept our pricing policies we need to,53
NA,make certain that they get the best possible deal.,53
NA,I firmly believe that liquefied petroleum gas,53
NA,use is here to stay. I hope that most members of,53
NA,this House would support a high-powered cam-,53
NA,paign asking people to convert to LPG. This,53
NA,would not involve just issuing a Press statement,53
NA,saying that we hope that they will do this and we,53
NA,hope that they will do that. We need to tell the,53
NA,people of Australia the benefits and the disad-,53
NA,vantages. I hope that with such encouragement,53
NA,we will be able to save our precious oil. Such a,53
NA,thrust would be of great advantage to the Aus-,53
NA,a waiting list tralian motoring public.,53
Mr JACOBI ,Hawker) (5.39)-On the,53
NA,Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Grants) Bill and the,53
NA,Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) we have a,53
NA,wide-ranging debate. The heart of the issue is the,53
NA,energy policies of this Government. The Govern-,53
NA,ment does not have an energy policy; it is a mish-,53
NA,mash. Its import parity pricing policy on both oil,53
NA,and gas is nothing more than a policy structured,53
NA,to satisfy the Treasury and to provide its revenue,53
NA,input. The Government will receive $3.5 billion,53
NA,because of its pricing policy. If this policy is at all,53
NA,"constructive, why is it that this Government can",53
NA,allocate only $9.1m of that $3.5 billion for en-,53
NA,"ergy research? It is a shambles, hypocrisy and a",53
NA,"disgrace. The Federal Treasury, in a recent sub-",53
NA,mission to the Senate Standing Committee on,53
NA,"National Resources, stated:",53
NA,. . . for the sources of energy which are traded,53
NA,"internationally-e.g . oil, natural gas, and coal-anothe r con-",53
NA,dition is that the price be equivalent to world parity level. An,53
NA,import parity price consisting of the world price plus,53
NA,transport and other associated costs should be charged when,53
NA,"some of Australian requirements are imported, and an",53
NA,export parity price less these costs when fuel is exported.,53
NA,Liquefied petroleum gas has recently been priced,53
NA,on this basis with the endorsement of the Prices,53
NA,"Justification Tribunal, presumably on accept-",54
NA,ance of the posted price for LPG at the Persian,54
NA,Gulf plus freight and ancillary charges to Aus-,54
NA,tralian ports. Is there any reason why refineries,54
NA,should get $252 a tonne when a cost-related,54
NA,price would be of the order of $100 a tonne? The,54
NA,PJT no longer has jurisdiction in pricing LPG on,54
NA,a cost-related basis. The price of LPG has been,54
NA,"lowered by $47 a tonne, as a result of the recent",54
NA,"decision of this Government, to be available for",54
NA,transport and domestic use at half the price of,54
NA,gasolene. This reduces the export price for Aus-,54
NA,tralian consumers from $252 a tonne to $205 a,54
NA,tonne.,54
NA,"Oil refineries produce about 350,000 tonnes",54
NA,"per annum, of the total Australian consumption",54
NA,"of 450,000 tonnes. The remaining 100,000 breath",54
NA,tonnes comes from Esso-BHP in Bass Strait. The,54
NA,"350,000 tonnes per annum from refineries acts",54
NA,amounts to only about 2 per cent of total refinery,54
NA,products. This sector of refinery,54
NA,priced at $88 a tonne in January 1979 and later,54
NA,at $147 a tonne. In January this year it was,54
NA,priced at $252 a tonne to correspond with an,54
NA,f.o.b. price or a c.i.f. price in Japan of Australian,54
NA,naturally occurring LPG less freight and export,54
NA,charges. In other words it was priced at world,54
NA,export parity The arbitrary reduction of $47,54
NA,tonne has resulted in the gasolene price from,54
NA,refineries being increased by 18c a litre by the,54
NA,PJT. The price of LPG from refineries follows,54
NA,the Government directives; it is not the price,54
NA,"termined by the PJT, although the latter",54
NA,been obliged to approve the increases in crude.,54
NA,gasolene prices as a result of the directives to re-,54
NA,duce the price by $47 a tonne. For many years oil,54
NA,refineries supplied fuel oil to the Australian,54
NA,dustry at only a fraction of the price of imported,54
NA,"fuel oil, such reductions being made at the",54
NA,"pense of higher prices for gasolene, turbine fuel",54
NA,and other products of the refineries. Fuel oil from,54
NA,refineries is no longer sold at lower prices than,54
NA,imports.,54
NA,Surely today there is scope for the price,54
NA,LPG from refineries to be also a fraction of the,54
NA,price of imported LPG or its equivalent posted,54
NA,export price. It is important to have a fuel of,54
NA,importance available cheaply. As LPG constilevels,54
NA,"tutes only 2 per cent of refinery products, the",54
NA,prices of all refinery products could absorb withmade,54
NA,"out substantial increases a conceded price of,",54
NA,"$100 a tonne for LPG, against $252 a tonne for",54
NA,export-a s fuel oil was sold at $20 a tonne,54
NA,against imported oil or parity fuel which was,54
NA,then $70 a tonne. The oil refineries are the,54
NA,"to make this adjustment, not necessarily the pro-",54
NA,ducers of naturally occurring LPG whose receiv-,54
NA,ing of export parity price gives the incentives for,54
NA,"greater oil search and, we hope, greater oil pro-",54
NA,duction from Australian crudes. The Treasury,54
NA,submission abounds in statements such as:,54
NA,The supply of energy is influenced by the rewards avail-,54
NA,able to energy producers and the demand for energy is,54
NA,affected by its price.,54
NA,No commendation is to be given to this Treasury,54
NA,attitude which preaches perfect competition,54
NA,amidst ideal conditions. Energy pricing is too im-,54
NA,portant to allow theoretical economic principles,54
NA,to be followed in certain sections of our com-,54
NA,munity in isolation. This is clearly the situation,54
NA,that has applied in Western Australia in the,54
NA,pricing of North West Shelf gas. In the same,54
NA,the Treasury also states that the receipt by,54
NA,natural gas producers of'artificially low prices,54
NA,to discourage the optimum level of recovery,54
NA,from existing sources and exploration for new,54
NA,production was sources of gas'.,54
NA,I suggest that this statement is incorrect. The,54
NA,so-called low prices were fixed on a commercial,54
NA,basis and explorers know very well that higher,54
NA,prices will be paid for any newfinds.Revenues,54
NA,from existing wells will be spent where the,54
NA,"highest rate of return is attainable, including ex-",54
NA,a ploration spending. The present pricing of,54
NA,liquefied petroleum gas to Australian consumers,54
NA,needs a full inquiry based on the scheduling of,54
NA,actual and long term costs of producing LPG gas,54
NA,defrom Australian sources and from refineries pro-,54
NA,has ducing LPG from imported and indigenous,54
NA,I should like to direct a series of questions to,54
NA,inthe Minister and to the Depanment. Does the,54
NA,Government regularly monitor the production of,54
NA,exoil in the Middle East? Does the Government,54
NA,maintain any check on oil product cargoes from,54
NA,the Middle East to ensure that cargoes initially,54
NA,destined for this country are not diverted to other,54
NA,destinations in the event of a sudden shortage,54
NA,developing? Does the Government monitor the,54
NA,actual sale price of crude oil and LPG in the,54
NA,of Middle East? Is the Government satisfied that,54
NA,the oil companies are acquiring oil at the most,54
NA,favourable price for Australian use? Has the,54
NA,this Government made any estimates of the likely,54
NA,of oil production by Middle East producers,54
NA,in the nextfiveto 10 years? Has the Government,54
NA,any estimates of likely future oil prices?,54
NA,"say, What efforts has the Government made to re-",54
NA,duce the risk of supply interruptions by diversify-,54
NA,ing sources of supply of crude oil for Australian,54
NA,use? What are the prospects of successfully diver-,54
NA,"ones sifying sources of supply such as Venezuela,",54
NA,China and Nigeria? What options are being can-,55
NA,vassed? What is the level of oil trade on a,55
NA,government-to-government basis both generally,55
NA,and for the major exporters? Which of the major,55
NA,exporters are now engaged on this sort of trade?,55
NA,Do countries importing oil on this basis normally,55
NA,"receive favourable treatment-fo r example, first",55
NA,"priority in the event of supply interruptions, or",55
NA,better prices? What efforts has the Government,55
NA,made or is it making towards establishing,55
NA,government-to-government oil imports for,55
NA,Australia? What progress has been made?,55
NA,For the last three years this Government has,55
NA,maintained a stoney silence on what is becoming,55
NA,a very critical issue. What is the likelihood of,55
NA,Middle East oil producers wanting to increase,55
NA,the level of refined products exported at the ex-,55
NA,pense of crude oil? What effect would this have,55
NA,on the AustraUan oil refining industry and on the,55
NA,cost of oil products in Australia? Is the Govern-,55
NA,ment taking any action to offset any disadvant-,55
NA,ages that this change may bring? I should like to,55
NA,make a few observations. At the moment,55
NA,"Australia relies on its importation of crude oil,",55
NA,basically from the Middle East. AustraUa im-,55
NA,"ports crude oU, from, in this order, Saudi Arabia,",55
NA,"Kuwait, Indonesia, Iraq, the United Arab",55
NA,"Emirates, Singapore and Bahrain. The Iranian",55
NA,revolution had such a dramatic impact on the oil,55
NA,business not only because it reduced the flow of,55
NA,crude oil to world markets but also because it,55
NA,disrupted traditional marketing patterns. Crude,55
NA,od supplies were gradually being shifted from in-,55
NA,ternational oil companies to governments of,55
NA,exporting countries. This will have long term im-,55
NA,plications for this country.,55
NA,In 1978 an advisory body to Japan's Ministry,55
NA,of International Trade and Industry-MITI -,55
NA,published a far-reaching report on the future di-,55
NA,rection of that country's oil policy. It made cer-,55
NA,tain recommendations and I think we ought to,55
NA,note them. They were:,55
NA,(i) to diversify the sources of crude imports away,55
NA,the Middle East towards the Pacific region;,55
NA,(ii) increase the proportion of imports contracted,55
NA,through deals with,55
NA,governments;,55
NA,(iii) double the share of imports developed by Japanese,55
NA,companies and expand exploration in Japan and,55
NA,overseas;,55
NA,(iv) broaden financial and technical co-operation with,55
NA,oil-exporting states;,55
NA,(v) enlarge the scope of the Japanese National Oil Cor-,55
NA,poration (JNOC);,55
NA,(vi) .increase oil stockpiles;,55
NA,(vii) consolidate the local industry; and,55
NA,(viii) step up usage of natural gas.,55
NA,"Fortunately for the Japanese, in the context of",55
NA,"the critical situation in the Middle East, it had",55
NA,sufficient forethought at least to tackle these con-,55
NA,tingencies. We as a nation and the Government,55
NA,ought to examine the critical and radical situ-,55
NA,ation which is developing in the Middle East.,55
NA,"Amongst producers, Iraq has been the chief pro-",55
NA,ponent of government-to-government deals for a,55
NA,"number of years. In addition, sources within the",55
NA,Department of Foreign Affairs indicate clearly,55
NA,"that Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab",55
NA,Emirates and Kuwait are now all keen to enter,55
NA,government-to-government contracts. These are,55
NA,countries on which we rely for oil.,55
NA,Treasury sources further suggest that all 13,55
NA,members of the Organisation of Petroleum,55
NA,Exporting Countries now have national oil,55
NA,companies. All the consuming countries now,55
NA,have national oil companies involved in import-,55
NA,"ing oil, with the exception of two-Australi a and",55
NA,the United States. With exporters exerting more,55
NA,"control over their oil, consuming countries are",55
NA,forced to seek more private supply arrangements,55
NA,because the traditional oil companies can no,55
NA,"longer meet their needs. Recently, delivery cut-",55
NA,backs by international companies have forced,55
NA,"Japan, Italy, Sweden and Greece to seek oU di-",55
NA,rectly from the Middle East countries rather than,55
NA,through the oil companies. Reinforcing this trend,55
NA,is the producers' view that sovereign states are,55
NA,not bound by commercial contract. We ought to,55
NA,take note of that contingency. OPEC countries,55
NA,obviously appear to have been chiefly concerned,55
NA,with alleged profiteering by oil companies. That,55
NA,is another aspect which we ought to examine.,55
NA,The Iraqi oil Minister said:,55
NA,. . . in the long run we feel that the ideal situation is to,55
NA,have a direct relationship between the producers and con-,55
NA,sumers so that there will be no middlemen and no,55
NA,brokers . . .,55
NA,More recently Iraq's President Hussein,55
NA,explained bis policy. He said that Iraq should:,55
NA,from . . . expand sales to national oil companies rather than,55
NA,middlemen who are seen as exploiting oil shortages to in-,55
NA,crease their own profits.,55
NA,state oil companies and producer,55
NA,"In addition, oil producers seek contracts which",55
NA,involve a quid pro quo. Paul Lewis of the New,55
NA,York Times recently had this to say:,55
NA,"Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and even such radical Arab",55
NA,states as Libya and Iraq prefer to sell an increasing quantity,55
NA,of oil to consumer governments under package deals that in-,55
NA,volve reciprocal Western help for their industrial plans.,55
NA,Kuwait's oil minister has predicted that as OPEC countries,55
NA,"develop their own oil-based industries, they will only sell",55
NA,crude oil to countries which also buy their plastics and petro-,55
NA,chemicals. ENI -,55
NA,That is in Italy-,55
NA,has been especially aggressive in offering industrial aid as,56
NA,part of deals with Libya and Iraq. Even a Western oil ex-,56
NA,"porter, Norway, is fishing for",56
NA,ment in return for oil sales to Germany and France.,56
NA,As a result of increased government to governof,56
NA,"ment deals, large oil companies are in the process",56
NA,of completely phasing out crude oil trade beassess,56
NA,tween producers and consuming countries. ensure,56
NA,Honourable members should note the report of access,56
NA,the Economist Intelligence Unit to this effect:,56
NA,This change in the structure of the international,56
NA,in part stems from the preference of OPEC state companies,56
NA,for government-to-government deals.,56
NA,"It was reported that South Korea, which used",56
NA,import 33 per cent of its crude oil from Kuwait,56
NA,"through the Gulf Oil Co., wants to switch to",56
NA,government-to-government crude oil supply,56
NA,deal. What is the reason for that? Taiwan is said,56
NA,"to be more fortunate than South Korea, having",56
NA,"made early provisions to secure oil for 1980,",56
NA,relying heavily on government-to-government,56
NA,deals with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Reflecting,56
NA,"on these trends, the Director of the Middle East",56
NA,Centre at St Anthony's College in Oxford had,56
NA,this to say:,56
NA,Many governments in the major consuming countries,56
NA,have long understood the strategic and economic sig-,56
NA,nificance of petroleum. Those countries which were not,56
NA,parents of the major oil companies (virtually everybody,56
NA,except the US and for a period the UK) felt at some time or,56
NA,"another that the majors, precisely because they could oper-",56
NA,"ate in a multitude of places, could not be relied on to act",56
NA,always in the national interest of every individual nation.,56
NA,"This is no criticism of the majors, just an illustration",56
NA,old adage that you cannot please everybody and his,56
NA,"brothers. If petroleum is vital, then every major country",56
NA,be able to rely on a national operator which could: (a) pro-,56
NA,vide information and first-hand knowledge about petroleum,56
NA,to the government: (b) secure a nationally-owned base,56
NA,"supplies, refining, marketing; and (c) in some cases,",56
NA,with the majors in the international petroleum market and,56
NA,affirm in that area the presence of that particular state.,56
NA,There are a number of recent experiences which,56
NA,illustrate the advantages of State oil corportonne.,56
NA,ations. I will not list them at this stage but I will,56
NA,mention the Pertamina Corporation which,56
NA,affects us. Pertamina's exports for 1980 will,56
NA,squeezed by a decline in production and growing,56
NA,domestic requirements in Indonesia. As a result,56
NA,will entirely eliminate some small volume cusparticular,56
NA,"tomers. However, it has agreed to continue to",56
NA,"honour its state to state deals with Japan,",56
NA,Thailand and the Philippines. Any surplus oil,56
NA,will be sold on the spot market. The same arareas.,56
NA,rangement applies between Saudi Arabia and the,56
NA,"Italy, and between Spain and Iraq.",56
NA,This Government's policy has been totally and rising,56
NA,bankrupt in this area over the last four years. It is a,56
NA,disastrous that this country has no criteria or polsee,56
NA,icy to meet that contingency. In the light of the will,56
NA,"critical Middle East situation, the confrontation this",56
NA,"between the United States and Iran, the role in",56
NA,"part of the Soviet Union, and the critical depen-",56
NA,pledges of industrial invest-,56
NA,dence by many countries in the Western world-,56
NA,this country included-o n the need for continuity,56
NA,"access to Middle East crude oil, surely this",56
NA,"Government has an obligation to co-ordinate, to",56
NA,and to evaluate its options in order to,56
NA,that at least this nation has a long term,56
NA,"to, and continuity of, supplies of oil. That",56
NA,ought to be this Government's first priority. I ask,56
NA,oil market the Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr,56
NA,"John MCLeay), who is sitting at the table: What",56
NA,will happen if supplies of crude oil from the,56
NA,to Middle East are cut off in the next few months?,56
NA,What policies have been enunciated or looked,56
NA,a at? If we diversified and imported oil from the,56
NA,"Venezuelan, Nigerian or the Chinese markets,",56
NA,what refining capacities would we have in this,56
NA,country to meet those imports? I suggest that the,56
NA,and answer to that question is that at this time we,56
NA,have none. This is a disaster and a disgrace.,56
NA,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,56
Mr MACKENZIE ,Calare) (8.0)-In speaking,56
NA,in this debate on the Liquefied Petroleum Gas,56
NA,(Grants) Bill and the Excise Tariff Amendment,56
NA,Bill (No. 3)1 take the opportunity to make some,56
NA,comments about liquefied petroleum gas and in,56
NA,particular the effect of gas prices on those people,56
NA,in Australia who live outside the major metro-,56
NA,politan centres of population. Before I make,56
NA,of the those comments I should like to refer to the,56
NA,Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Grants) Bill 1980.,56
NA,must The essence of this Bill is to provide a subsidy for,56
NA,domestic gas consumers throughout Australia,56
NA,for who are currently reliant on LPG as a fuel for,56
NA,"compete heating, cooking and hot water. The Govern-",56
NA,ment has decided that to afford some relief to,56
NA,those people in country and regional areas of,56
NA,Australia it will provide a subsidy of some $80 a,56
NA,This will provide some relief from the bur-,56
NA,"den of high gas bills. I, together with many other",56
NA,"members of the Government parties, have",56
NA,"be received numerous representations, both verbal",56
NA,and in writing. Some of them highlight the des-,56
NA,it perate situation in which many older people in,56
NA,and large families find themselves as,56
NA,"they are faced with rapidly rising gas bills, par-",56
NA,ticularly in the colder areas of Australia.,56
NA,"Needless to say, I represent many of those colder",56
NA,I should like to quote one such letter from,56
NA,many hundreds that I have received. It states:,56
NA,1 am writing to you to lodge my protest against the high,56
NA,price of LP gas. I am a 70 year old pensioner with,56
NA,gas stove and water heater. For heating I use oil so you can,56
NA,my total misfortune and that of many of my elderly,56
NA,friends and also family with a lot of children who possibly,56
NA,not be able to afford to cook a hot meal or to keep warm,56
NA,"winter. May I remind you sir, that the cold winter-",56
NA,The writer lives in the Bathurst area-,57
NA,Has a severe toll on us old folks. The obituary column,57
NA,newspaper bears this sad testimony.,57
NA,I think that letter sums up the dilemma with,57
NA,which many of the older people in the com-,57
NA,munity are faced because of enormous price rises,57
NA,for LPG. One really cannot blame them for that,57
NA,dilemma. It was not so long ago that the oil,57
NA,companies and other bodies were encouraging,57
NA,gas utilities to convert their coal generation gas,57
NA,plants to LPG. I do not believe that we can,57
NA,"blame those gas utilities, many of which are",57
NA,"operated by local government councils, for",57
NA,taking that advice. At the time it appeared to be,57
NA,"sound advice. Consequently, many gas utilities",57
NA,have had to amortise losses on their out-of-date,57
NA,and outmoded coal gas plants to convert to LPG.,57
NA,Now they find themselves in a potential situation,57
NA,of not being able to continue using LPG. Some,57
NA,may even have to revert to coal-fired energy sys-,57
NA,"tems. The councils, in many cases, have borne",57
NA,the losses incurred over the years through cross-,57
NA,"subsidy, amongst their other revenue producing",57
NA,operations. I believe that some relief should be,57
NA,afforded to those councils for the difficulties in,57
NA,which they have found themselves.,57
NA,In addition to the $80 subsidy which is appli-,57
NA,cable to domestic consumers and a wider range,57
NA,of users of LPG following the Government's re-,57
NA,"cent decision, I am pleased to see that residential",57
NA,"institutions of a non-profit nature, such as hospi-",57
NA,"tals and schools, will also be eligible. Inciden-",57
NA,"tally, I have been talking to boards of manage-",57
NA,"ment of pre-schools in my area, which have",57
NA,found great difficulty in bearing the additional,57
NA,"cost burden of their gas bills, particularly in",57
NA,country areas. This Bill provides some relief for,57
NA,other groups in the community who are totally,57
NA,dependent on LPG. The subsidy will be appli-,57
NA,cable as from 28 March. I presume that some,57
NA,type of rebate or refund will be paid through the,57
NA,States to the gas utilities concerned. I also note,57
NA,that payment of the subsidy to the registered dis-,57
NA,tributors of gas will be conditional in all cases,57
NA,upon the full benefit of the subsidy being passed,57
NA,back to the consumers. I was not aware that this,57
NA,was a provision in the Bill. I am pleased that it is.,57
NA,"At the sametime,I am mindful of the difficulties",57
NA,that some gas utilities face. They have been,57
NA,"operating at a loss for some time so, presumably,",57
NA,they have had to pass that burden on to the rate-,57
NA,payers. The subsidy will be applicable for three,57
NA,years and will cost some $60m.,57
NA,I have some reservations about the validity,57
NA,a blanket subsidy of $80 a tonne. I hope that,57
NA,what we are doing is not simply deferring the day,57
NA,of reckoning and decision for many domestic,57
NA,consumers. Perhaps there will be some oppor-,57
NA,in any tunity for a tapering of that subsidy or we might,57
NA,make it quite clear that at the end of that subsidy,57
NA,period of three years we would expect domestic,57
NA,"consumers, as well as other consumers who are",57
NA,"eligible for the subsidy, to be moving towards",57
NA,"other energy sources. Indeed, it may be appro-",57
NA,priate at that time to provide taxation incentives,57
NA,or some other type of incentive to consumers to,57
NA,convert to electricity or to another form of fuel,57
NA,appropriate to their particular circumstances.,57
NA,The subsidy will not apply to commercial and,57
NA,business undertakings. I find that a little difficult,57
NA,to understand. I have made representations on,57
NA,behalf of some users of gas who have no real,57
NA,alternative to gas as a fuel for their commercial,57
NA,operations. One such group are orchadists who,57
NA,use LPG in controlled atmosphere storage of,57
NA,their fruit. This matter is of considerable import-,57
NA,"ance to orchardists in my area, where controlled",57
NA,atmosphere storage of fruit is a very widespread,57
NA,and lucrative operation for orchardists. As I,57
NA,"understand it, LPG is essential to burn oxygen",57
NA,out ofthe atmosphere in which the fruit is stored.,57
NA,Oxygen has to be removed from the gases that,57
NA,are used in controlling storage atmosphere to,57
NA,prevent oxidation of the fruit and thereby to,57
NA,extend the fruit Ufe very considerably.,57
NA,The additional measures announced by the,57
NA,Government are welcome. In addition to the $80,57
NA,subsidy a new price agreement has been nego-,57
NA,tiated with the gas producers. Not only the cur-,57
NA,"rent gas producers but also, it is expected, those",57
NA,producers which are operating in areas where,57
NA,"new gasfieldsmay come on stream, will abide by",57
NA,the Government's wishes that the domestic re-,57
NA,quirements should be realised as a priority for,57
NA,production. The result of these measures taken,57
NA,together will be a very considerable reduction in,57
NA,"gas prices. The price of propane, for example,",57
NA,will drop from $252 a tonne ex-refinery to ap-,57
NA,proximately $125 a tonne. That is at least a 50,57
NA,"per cent reduction. The price of butane, under",57
NA,the new price negotiations and agreements be-,57
NA,"tween the Government and the gas producers,",57
NA,will be reduced from some $290 a tonne ex-,57
NA,refinery to $205 a tonne as from 9 April last. This,57
NA,"will provide very substantial relief, particularly",57
NA,"in regional and country areas, for those people",57
NA,who have little immediate alternative to LPG for,57
NA,their heating and cooking requirements.,57
NA,Furthermore I believe the new policy will have,57
NA,very substantial implications for the further use,57
NA,"of of LPG as an automotive fuel. This, indeed, is",57
NA,most essential because we must face up to the,57
NA,eventual reality that the use of LPG for cooking,57
NA,gas and heating purposes is a complete waste of a,57
NA,very scarce and valuable energy resource. We,58
NA,must encourage the substitution of petrol by gas,58
NA,as much as possible if we are to maintain and,58
NA,guarantee our liquid fuel requirements in the im-,58
NA,mediate short term before other new crude oil,58
NA,fields are found or other new sources of synthetic,58
NA,liquid fuel come into widespread use.,58
NA,The decisions taken by the Government have,58
NA,the effect of maintaining a differential between,58
NA,the price of LPG and that of petrol of some 50,58
NA,"per cent. Thefigures,as I understand them, are",58
NA,based on Melbourne prices. The price of LPG,58
NA,will be reduced to 16.5c per litre compared with,58
NA,the price of petrol in Melbourne of 33c per litre.,58
NA,Additionally the Government has announced an,58
NA,extension of tax incentives similar to those which,58
NA,now apply for oil fired uses to industries which,58
NA,convert from LPG to other sources of energy.,58
NA,There has been some discussion in country,58
NA,areas in particular that the subsidy has not been,58
NA,applied to business and commercial users of,58
NA,"LPG. The new price negotiations, of course, do",58
NA,apply so that we must make it quite clear that,58
NA,even though existing business and commercial,58
NA,users of LPG will enjoy a 20 per cent cut in price,58
NA,for propane and 30 per cent cut in price for,58
NA,"butane respectively, these businesses will not get",58
NA,the benefit of the additional subsidy of $80 a,58
NA,tonne. That does have some implications for de-,58
NA,centralisation. Certainly it has some implications,58
NA,for industries that have been encouraged to,58
NA,move out of the major metropolitan complexes,58
NA,to country areas. In many cases they have been,58
NA,encouraged to do so with the prospect of natural,58
NA,gas becoming available.,58
NA,I think we need to discuss the future for,58
NA,industries and for consumers of LPG and what,58
NA,the situation might be in a number of years.,58
NA,cannot simply pat ourselves on the backs too easYet,58
NA,ily saying that we have alleviated the problem,58
NA,for gas consumers without taking into account,58
NA,what might be the reality of the situation in the,58
NA,future. To this end I believe that we should be,58
NA,encouraging the much wider distribution of,58
NA,natural gas throughout Australia wherever,58
NA,ible and wherever practicable. In order to do,58
NA,"this, of course, gas consumers and the utilities",58
NA,supplying them must realise that the,58
NA,wealth Government is not prepared to provide a,58
NA,network of feeder lines from the main natural,58
NA,gas pipelines at no charge. There has been an,58
NA,"ditional distribution of natural gas to Canberra,",58
NA,"Newcastle, Wagga Wagga, Cootamundra and so cause,",58
NA,"on through to Albury, connecting the Cooper",58
NA,Basinfieldswith those of Bass Strait. It must be,58
NA,fully realised that the taxpayer will not foot the,58
NA,"bill for these lines. In other words, over a number",58
NA,"of years, the consumers, through the utilities, will",58
NA,have to pay off the capital cost of providing those,58
NA,spur lines in the tariffs that they will pay.,58
NA,In my area there has been an undertaking to,58
NA,"provide natural gas to the cities of Bathurst, Or-",58
NA,ange and Lithgow. These three cities are highly,58
NA,dependent on liquefied petroleum gas at the mo-,58
NA,ment. Obviously the councils of those cities are,58
NA,concerned that the ratepayers will be footing a,58
NA,"very substantial bill, both now and in the future,",58
NA,if they are to pay the full cost of constructing that,58
NA,"pipeline, which will be in the vicinity of $36m to",58
NA,$40m. I can well understand that the councils,58
NA,might be sceptical about such a major long term,58
NA,debt commitment in view of the experiences that,58
NA,"they have had in the past, particularly in regard",58
NA,to their conversion of coal gas plants to LPG,58
NA,plants. I cannot blame them for their scepticism.,58
NA,"However, another company might be willing to",58
NA,distribute gas to those centres. In this case it is the,58
NA,Australian Gas Light Co. The councils should,58
NA,consider transferring their gas utilities to AGL.,58
NA,AGL is an organisation which does have some,58
NA,opportunity to cross-subsidise within its oper-,58
NA,ations. It therefore has the opportunity to pro-,58
NA,vide natural gas to many country centres at a,58
NA,reasonable price- a price that will be acceptable,58
NA,to consumers and a price that will encourage in-,58
NA,dustries to decentralise and encourage those in-,58
NA,dustries that have decentralised to stay in the lo-,58
NA,cation to which they have moved.,58
NA,"Further, as I mentioned before, the Govern-",58
NA,ment needs to consider very carefully what will,58
NA,be the situation of domestic gas consumers in a,58
NA,number of years. There are many centres in,58
NA,those Australia where gas is an important energy,58
NA,source and where the subsidy will ensure that gas,58
NA,We is continued to be used for a number of years.,58
NA,we must realise that in three or five years',58
NA,time the use of LPG for those purposes will be a,58
NA,luxury. So in closing I suggest that the Govern-,58
NA,ment turns its attention to the longer term view,58
NA,and looks at the prospects and the opportunities,58
NA,for providing new incentives for domestic con-,58
NA,feassumers to move away from LPG as an energy,58
NA,source and substitute their appliances with ones,58
NA,"that are powered by electricity or, as may be the",58
NA,"Commoncase, another form of energy.",58
Mr LES JOHNSON ,Hughes) (8.16)-The,58
NA,adBills wliich are now before the House have great,58
NA,importance for the Australian community be-,58
NA,"I suppose, it is a fact of life that there is a",58
NA,great sense of uncertainty as to how our way of,58
NA,life which is substantially contributed to by the,58
NA,use of motor vehicles and air travel will be sus-,58
NA,tained in the future. The Liquefied Petroleum,58
NA,Gas (Grants) Bill and the Excise Tariff Amend-,59
NA,ment Bill (No. 3) go to the very heart of this,59
NA,Government's energy policy. In talking on these,59
NA,Bills honourable members have a tendency-,59
NA,"indeed, they are right to do so-t o range over a",59
NA,great area of speculation and anticipation. One,59
NA,can go to the Parliamentary Library and read of,59
NA,all the enormous energy potential that is avail-,59
NA,able to this country and to the world. We hear of,59
NA,plants that produce energy factors. We hear of,59
NA,the solar stack proposition whereby signals from,59
NA,great stations some 25 miles long can be pro-,59
NA,jected into space on behalf of the nations of the,59
NA,world and whereby energy is transmitted back to,59
NA,earth for use in vehicles and for other energy,59
NA,consuming activities. When we look at things,59
NA,from that standpoint the matters being raised in,59
NA,the debate tonight seems to be of a fairly low cal-,59
NA,"ibre. Nevertheless, the legislation is not without",59
NA,"significance, as the honourable member who",59
NA,"preceded me in this debate, the honourable",59
NA,member for Calare ( Mr MACKenzie) has pointed,59

NA,The Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Grants) Bill,59
NA,"provides, amongst other things, for grants to",59
NA,made to the States to enable the States to pay,59
NA,registered distributors of liquefied petroleum,59
NA,a subsidy of $80 a tonne on LPG sold to those,59
NA,consumers. I feel that this entire area has been,59
NA,characterised by a lack of government initiative.,59
NA,There is no doubt that if there is a sensitive,59
NA,tion issue around-w e are in an election year-,59
NA,"that issue is fuel prices, whether it be LPG",59
NA,butane or the conventional fuel for vehicles.,59
NA,body is satisfied that proper policies are being,59
NA,pursued. There has been virtually plucked out of,59
NA,the air a very dogmatic attitude that we have to,59
NA,"have a world parity pricing philosophy, whether",59
NA,it is in respect of Arabian oil-suc h a policy,59
NA,be justified-o r whether it,59
NA,call old oil.,59
NA,One wonders how we can logically account for,59
NA,"this policy. I suppose, if one were seeking to",59
NA,"bring logic to bear, one would be contending that",59
NA,an increase in the price of fuel would be effective,59
NA,in deterring people from using thisfinitequality,59
NA,which is going to run out at some time in the,59
NA,future. Although there probably has been a,59
NA,slight arresting of the upward trend of fuel con-,59
NA,"sumption, nothing more can be said about it than",59
NA,"that, except, of course, that the Government can",59
NA,wallow in the realisation that it has contrived in,59
NA,all this mystique a unique and surreptitious way,59
NA,of deriving income from the Australian com-,59
NA,munity. It is a fortuitous set of circumstances in,59
NA,"that, as the election period comes closer, the",59
NA,"Government, represented by the Treasurer ( Mr",59
NA,"Howard), can dip into the income bag from fuel",59
NA,taxes and provide benefits in largess and hand-,59
NA,outs to the Australian community. Make no mis-,59
NA,"take, the Australian community does not want to",59
NA,play this game that the Government is engaging,59
NA,in. The use of motor cars is very much our way of,59
NA,life. Young people these days often get a car be-,59
NA,fore they even think of getting a house. They,59
NA,want to get petrol on the best terms available.,59
NA,"They are sick and tired of this sleight of hand,",59
NA,"this thimble and pea trick, which is being perpe-",59
NA,trated in this country at present.,59
NA,Let me talk for a moment about liquefied pet-,59
NA,roleum gas. The best part of a year ago the Prime,59
NA,Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) hailed LPG as,59
NA,the fuel of the future. With massive pricerisesin,59
NA,recent weeks it would take the average family,59
NA,"motoristfiveyears to recoup, from the saving on",59
NA,"fuel bills, the cost of converting the family car to",59
NA,LPG. For some unaccountable reason the,59
NA,Government has brought to bear a world parity,59
NA,pricing policy in respect of LPG that has a,59
NA,greater impact than its policy in respect of con-,59
NA,be ventional fuel. On 27 June last year the Prime,59
NA,to Minister said that the Government would en-,59
NA,gas courage car owners to use LPG in their cars.,59
NA,Then the Government dropped the retail tax to,59
NA,make the pump price 9.5c a litre. Just over six,59
NA,months later the price of LPG rose to 18.9c a,59
NA,eleclitre. That was an increase of 100 per cent. The,59
NA,sequence of price increase began almost immedi-,59
NA,or ately when the Government dropped the retail,59
NA,Notax. Within a month the 2.1c a litre cut achieved,59
NA,by the removal of the tax had been erased by a,59
NA,2c a litre price rise. From then on the price rose,59
NA,steadily to reach 18.9c a litre. These price rises,59
NA,were blamed on the world parity pricing system.,59
NA,could That is precisely where the blame should be,59
NA,is in respect of what we placed.,59
NA,The annual fuel saving of $310 for a family,59
NA,sedan running on LPG six months ago has been,59
NA,"cut by more than $70, according to a number of",59
NA,experts. There is an initial conversion outlay of,59
NA,"$850, or thereabouts, that has to be recouped. I",59
NA,understand that the actual investment is more,59
NA,"than $1,200 if one takes into account the interest",59
NA,that people have to pay on such a capital outlay.,59
NA,That is the very sorry story as it affects the motor-,59
NA,ist and the average citizen. Even from the,59
NA,Government's point of view in respect of money,59
NA,saving policies there is much to be desired. I re-,59
NA,call very well the great contentions that LPG was,59
NA,the answer. Test drives were carried out from,59
NA,Canberra to Sydney. It was found that the total,59
NA,cost of the round trip for the petrol car was,59
NA,$25.41. For the LPG car it was $15.01. Obvi-,60
NA,ously that test offered very great promise to the,60
NA,Austrahan community.,60
NA,If the Government is obsessed with the idea,60
NA,"that LPG is the answer, the best way to demonproblems,",60
NA,strate its enthusiasm is in respect of its own,60
NA,We have seen vacillation on that matter also.,60
NA,notice in the Melbourne Age of 28 June 1979,60
NA,mention of an announcement by the Minister,60
NA,Administrative Services ( Mr John MCLeay),60
NA,announced the awarding of contracts to convert,60
NA,to LPG 100 departmental vehicles in Melbourne. motor,60
NA,That was a very sensational initiative,60
NA,of the Government. Regrettably that represented,60
NA,less than one per cent of the Department's veIt,60
NA,hicles. One would have thought that a far greater,60
NA,effort might have been made even at that time.,60
NA,know that that effort has been superseded.,60
NA,Another announcement was made along these,60
NA,lines on 13 November 1979 by the then Minister,60
NA,"for National Development, Mr Newman. The than",60
NA,Minister said that the Government was taking,60
NA,further initiatives to encourage the wider use of,60
NA,"LPG, including the removal of the 2.125c a litre",60
NA,road tax and the 15 per cent sales tax previously,60
NA,applicable to kits used in vehicle conversion,60
NA,LPG. We heard something about these kits,60
NA,earlier in the debate.,60
NA,The Minister went on that it had been decided,60
NA,"that, in addition to the 100 Commonwealth",60
NA,"hicles already being converted in Melbourne, the",60
NA,Government intended to proceed with the,60
NA,conversion of a further 200 in Melbourne and,60
NA,250 in Canberra. I have not had the time to,60
NA,"out the extent of the fleet, but I have no doubt",60
NA,that there is still an infinitesimal proportion,60
NA,our Commonwealth fleet being converted to February,60
NA,LPG. A far better example could have been call,60
NA,given. I am not sure what requirements have,60
NA,been imposed on the statutory authorities. In,60
NA,many ways we can require people under the substantial,60
NA,influence of the Commonwealth,60
NA,thing in the interests of the nation. We do it in re-,60
NA,spect of environmental impact statements and,60
NA,the like. If we are making funds available to any-,60
NA,body using vehicles we could certainly require,60
NA,that as a condition of their receiving such funds.,60
NA,might say that this includes the States under,60
NA,"tion 96 of the Constitution, which is the conGovernment",60
NA,ditional grants section. We can have provisos,60
NA,encourage this conversion rate.,60
NA,The honourable member for Franklin ( Mr,60
NA,"Goodluck) talked earlier ""this evening about ago.",60
NA,these matters. He gave the impression that every-,60
NA,thing was all tied up and ready to,60
NA,ive conversion; there was little to,60
NA,all that had to be done was to surge into this pro-,60
NA,cess of conversion. That is just not the case at all.,60
NA,One has only to go to the Library-a s I did a,60
NA,short time ago-an d one will receive a number of,60
NA,media releases which show that there are many,60
NA,the solutions of which in many in-,60
NA,fleet. stances could have been accelerated if this,60
NA,I Government had been prepared to be more,60
NA,active in this area. The Sun News-Pictorial of,60
NA,for Melbourne on 5 December 1979 under the head-,60
NA,who ing ' LPG: new safety guide' stated:,60
NA,New guidelines on the use of liquefied petroleum gas in,60
NA,vehicles were introduced yesterday by the Standards',60
NA,on the part Association of Australia.,60
NA,"is true that new guidelines were introduced,",60
NA,but what imprimatur do they have from the,60
NA,I standpoint of governments? An article in the,60
NA,Melbourne Herald on 25 October 1979 under the,60
NA,heading' 40flawsin LPG rules' stated:,60
NA,The Society of Automotive Engineers has found more,60
NA,40 flaws in the regulations governing installation of,60
NA,liquid petroleum gas in vehicles.,60
NA,"According to the report, the Society sent a sched-",60
NA,ule of significant complaints to the Standards As-,60
NA,sociation of Australia. There are many other,60
NA,to newspaper clippings relating to the matter. For,60
NA,"example, the Melbourne Herald of 8 November",60
NA,1979 carries an article headed 'Leaking,60
NA,LPG-550 0 Recall'. The article goes on to ex-,60
NA,pand on the problem. The Adelaide Advertiser of,60
NA,ve2 November 1979 has an article entitled 'LPG,60
NA,"cylinders potential bombs, says firefighter'. A",60
NA,Canberra Times article of 4 March 1980 is,60
NA,headed 'US expert tells of safety problems'. The,60
NA,dig Sydney Morning Herald of 9 February 1980 car-,60
NA,ries an article entitled 'Engineer hopes for early,60
NA,of tank safety rules'. The Canberra Times of 1,60
NA,1980 has an article entitled 'Coroner's,60
NA,on LPG conversion'. So the list goes on. It,60
NA,just seems to me that so much of this matter,60
NA,should have been pulled together and a far more,60
NA,Federal initiative should be in evi-,60
NA,to do the right dence at this time.,60
NA,"In less than 12 months, LPG prices have risen",60
NA,by nearly 300 per cent following the latest lift of,60
NA,$105 per tonne to $254 per tonne. Of course,60
NA,I there are many fleet owners who regard this,60
NA,secdisincentive as coming from the failure of the,60
NA,to have firm views and attitudes. I,60
NA,to note that in the Melbourne Sun-News Pictorial of,60
NA,28 January 1980 mention is made of some ofthe,60
NA,concerned people. The article states:,60
NA,One driver said: ' I was paying seven cents a litre a year,60
NA,This latest move has made the idea of LPG as an alterna-,60
NA,go for a masstive fuel a big laugh'.,60
NA,be desired; and The article continues:,60
NA,"Mr Neil Smith, Gas and Fuel Corporation chairman,",61
NA,that the price rise was 'nothing short of commercial rape'.,61
NA,"'I'm amazed at the hyopcrisy of the situation',",61
NA,it wasn't so serious it would be laughable'.,61
NA,I do not have to tell honourable members op-,61
NA,posite about this debacle. They have been,61
NA,thrashing it out in their party meeting. There,61
NA,"have been, of course, legitimate complaints by",61
NA,"representatives of electorates, both city and",61
NA,"country, because the fleet owners in the city have",61
NA,been disadvantaged just as rural people have by,61
NA,the variations in the Government's policies and,61
NA,attitudes. The fact is that the price of LPG has,61
NA,skyrocketed from $88 per tonne in January 1979,61
NA,to the world parity price of $252 per tonne for,61
NA,propane and $294 for butane. Domestic demand,61
NA,for gas has been dropping because natural gas,61
NA,and electricity are priced more competitively for,61
NA,household users in rural areas. The conversion of,61
NA,cars from petrol to LPG has virtually stopped.,61
NA,"In the overall situation, this Government",61
NA,have to do a great deal to account for its policy,61
NA,regard to oil pricing matters. The fact is that,61
NA,Government is responsible for this situation.,61
NA,When the Fraser Government was first elected to,61
NA,"office, the average family car- a Holden or",61
NA,"Falcon or a Valiant, say-coul d be filled with",61
NA,petrol for $11.10. It now costs $23.50 to fill that,61
NA,car. That would be all right if some patriotic,61
NA,"some inescapable factor were involved, but that",61
NA,is not the case. The average car owner is paying,61
NA,$10 a week to $12 a week extra for fuel. There,61
NA,a bonanza for the Government in all this.,61
NA,"Through the oil tax and petrol excise, 50c in",61
NA,every petrol dollar goes straight to the Fraser,61
NA,Government.,61
NA,As the honourable member for Blaxland ( Mr,61
NA,"Keating) has said repeatedly, it is the unfairest",61
NA,tax of all. It makes no distinction as to capacity,61
NA,pay. The rich and the poor pay to the same,61
NA,"extent. Only last Monday, in company with the",61
NA,honourable member for Cunningham,61
NA,"West), I was addressing several hundred pen-",61
NA,sioners at Wollongong. They instanced the fact,61
NA,that it was no longer possible for many penit,61
NA,sioners to put their cars on the road. This,61
NA,Government is totally indifferent to that particuis,61
NA,"lar problem. The pensioners, to the extent that",61
NA,"they use motor cars, have to bear the burden",61
NA,"this tax to the same extent as the more privileged,",61
NA,"the more affluent, people in the community.",61
NA,the extent that this tax represents a source of rev-,61
NA,enue one could say that it involves an abandonportunity,61
NA,ment of the capacity to pay principle.,61
NA,lowest income earners very hard indeed. People,61
NA,in the country are also very seriously affected.,61
NA,said Some spend 10 per cent of their incomes on pet-,61
NA,rol as against the 2 per cent spent by those on,61
NA,he said. 'If higher incomes. When the Government puts up,61
NA,the price of Australian crude oil by $ 1 it has to be,61
NA,realised that 83c of that $ 1 goes straight to the,61
NA,Government and that the taxes paid through the,61
NA,petrol pump now exceed the total of all company,61
NA,"tax collected in Australia. In four years, govern-",61
NA,ment income from the oil tax alone has risen,61
NA,"from $250m to $2,400m a year. I believe that",61
NA,that is a very sorry state of affairs and a very un-,61
NA,necessary state of affairs. I am glad to see that in,61
NA,this legislation there will be subsidies for some,61
NA,sections of the community which will be using,61
NA,LPG. But that is not really getting to the kernel of,61
NA,the problem. It will not be until the Labor Party,61
NA,is again in office that we will get cheaper petrol.,61

Mr BAUME ,Macarthur) (8.37)-One would,61
NA,will not know from listening to the honourable,61
NA,in member for Hughes ( Mr Les Johnson) what this,61
NA,"the debate was supposed to be about. It is, in fact,",61
NA,about the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Grants) Bill,61
NA,"which, of course, is a Bill that provides a subsidy",61
NA,"a to liquefied petroleum gas users, particularly",61
NA,"those in country towns, as a consequence of",61
NA,which there is to be a reduction in the price of,61
NA,or LPG from the prices that the honourable,61
NA,member for Hughes appears to befixatedabout.,61
NA,Perhaps he was behaving like a Rip Van Winkle,61
NA,is and fell asleep sometimelast year. But I do wish,61
NA,he had woken up before he addressed the House,61
NA,tonight. The facts are that the prices he spoke,61
NA,of-th e high prices resulting from a Prices Jus-,61
NA,tification Tribunal inquiry-ar e now being cut,61
NA,drastically. They are being cut in half for dom-,61
NA,"estic consumers of gas in country areas and, in",61
NA,"fact, are being cut from the ex-refinery price of",61
NA,to $252 about which he spoke all the time to,61
NA,"$205- a cut of approximately $50 per tonne. So,",61
NA,the price he was talking about was in fact non-,61
NA,"( Mr sensical, as were his remarks.",61
NA,Let us see what the Labor Party's policy is-i f,61
NA,has one-o n LPG. The honourable member for,61
NA,"Blaxland ( Mr Keating) who, as I understand it,",61
NA,supposed to be reponsible for this area-i f one,61
NA,is responsible for it in Labor's policy-ha d this to,61
NA,of say in May 1979 in his Green Paper on energy,61
NA,"policy. This was, I think, the greening of the",61
NA,To honourable member for Blaxland. He said:,61
NA,Although the pricing of energy resources at well below op-,61
NA,"cost will yield short-term benefits, it will also give",61
NA,It hits the rise to long term costs.,61
NA,That remark relates clearly to the price of all,61
NA,gases-natura l and LP gas-tha t price being at a,61
NA,price lower than the price of oil. He went on to,62
NA,state:,62
NA,The ideal yardstick for the determination of gas prices is,62
NA,found in oil prices. Domestic gas prices should bear a re-,62
NA,alistic relativity to domestic oil prices.,62
NA,Here we have the man who is alleged to be the,62
NA,Labor Party spokesman on this area saying that,62
NA,there should be a relativity between oil and gas,62
NA,and saying by the way at other times that the,62
NA,price of oil would certainly be maintained under,62
NA,a Labor government-no t increased but main-,62
NA,tained. At the same time other members of the,62
NA,Opposition are getting up and bemoaning the,62
NA,"high price of LPG, complaining that this",62
NA,Government's disgraceful policies-s o called-,62
NA,"have, in fact, changed the margin between LPG",62
NA,and petrol. The facts are that either the honour-,62
NA,able member for Blaxland is wrong in stating,62
NA,Labor policy when he says that LPG and petrol,62
NA,"should have a realistic relativity-tha t in fact, it is",62
NA,wrong to price gas below the opportunity,62
NA,cost-o r his colleagues who have been talking in,62
NA,this debate tonight are wrong. I am inclined to,62
NA,"the view that they are all wrong, because they",62
NA,have not realised the benefit of the Federal,62
NA,"Government's specific policies, which are de-",62
NA,signed to assist those who unfortunately are,62
NA,oppressed as a consequence of the oil parity,62
NA,pricing policy as it relates to LPG. The Governcan,62
NA,ment has provided a benefit to such people while,62
NA,"maintaining the basic, and I believe, inviolable,",62
NA,"principle of oil parity pricing-on e that, with one",62
NA,"or two exceptions, is accepted among leading",62
NA,nations. Even those exceptions are steadily,62
NA,ing towards its acceptance.,62
NA,It would be appropriate to congratulate sevburn,62
NA,"eral honourable members who, when the consetrue-thos",62
NA,quences for country consumers of the impact of were,62
NA,the oil parity pricing policy on the price of LPG,62
NA,"became strikingly evident, brought significant",62
NA,pressure to bear on the Government to make,62
NA,"special concessions, in country areas especially,",62
NA,and also in respect of the use of LPG in auto-,62
NA,mobiles. One could mention the honourable,62
NA,"member for Calare ( Mr MACKenzie), who spoke",62
NA,"earlier, the honourable member for Macquarie",62
NA,"( Mr Gillard), the honourable member for Edenhope",62
NA,Monaro ( Mr Sainsbury) and the honourable natural,62
NA,"member for MCMillan ( Mr Simon), who were electricity.",62
NA,"particularly enthusiastic, as indeed I was, in",62
NA,proaching the Minister for National Developa,62
NA,ment and Energy (Senator Carrick) in an effort,62
NA,to resolve the serious problem which had arisen.,62
Mr BAILLIEU ,Wha t about me?,62
Mr BAUME,"Ther e were, of course, many House",62
NA,"honourable members, particularly those in the",62
NA,"country, in whose electorates there was a prob-",62
NA,"lem in this respect, and La Trobe is one such",62
NA,area.,62
NA,I wish to emphasise the serious consequences,62
NA,of oil parity pricing on a country town which de-,62
NA,pends for its gas supply upon LPG rather than,62
NA,natural gas. In the cities it is easy to convert to,62
NA,"another energy source. In a country town, the",62
NA,cost of doing so can be appalling. In the cities the,62
NA,gas is supplied as liquefied natural gas or LNG.,62
NA,Certainly that is true of Sydney and of most other,62
NA,Australian cities. It is a different commodity and,62
NA,"is priced differently from LPG, the 'P' in which",62
NA,relates to petroleum. It is liquefied petroleum,62
NA,gas. As a result of the import parity pricing policy,62
NA,an enormous increase occurred in country towns,62
NA,in the price of the feedstock from which town gas,62
NA,was derived. There was a significant increase,62
NA,also in the price of bottled gas. So there was,62
NA,"clearly a need, because of the lack of alternatives",62
NA,"and the high cost of conversion, for the Govern-",62
NA,ment to take a very sympathetic view of the im-,62
NA,pact on such country towns. I am glad to say that,62
NA,I was one of a group which managed to convince,62
NA,the Government that the rights of country gas,62
NA,consumers should be protected.,62
NA,It is wrong to waste a scarce and expensive re-,62
NA,"source such as liquefied petroleum gas, which",62
NA,be sold at a premium price overseas and can,62
NA,be used domestically in premium applications. It,62
NA,is wrong to burn it under a saucepan or in a,62
NA,"heater. There are other, cheaper fuels that can be",62
NA,"used for such purposes. Electricity is one, and",62
NA,moveven wood is another. There is no doubt that,62
NA,although the basic principle-tha t it is wasteful to,62
NA,a scarce resource under a pot or pan holds,62
NA,e in country towns who for a long time,62
NA,had been involved in the consumption of LPG,62
NA,placed in a very difficult position when sud-,62
NA,"denly its price rose. In many instances, they did",62
NA,not have available to them the alternatives that,62
NA,are readily available in the cities.,62
NA,The problem is aggravated by the fact that,62
NA,some country towns recently converted from gas,62
NA,supplies derived from coal. I would hope that,62
NA,many may seek a return to coal as a feedstock. I,62
NA,that other towns will be connected to the,62
NA,gas pipeline or will switch to the use of,62
NA,The problem has been alleviated by,62
NA,approviding a significant subsidy which will permit,62
NA,"breathing space of three years, to enable",62
NA,alternative energy sources to be arranged. There,62
NA,has been no basic divergence from the principle,62
NA,of oil parity pricing inherent in the provision of,62
NA,temporary assistance. As some members of this,62
NA,"have found out, three years is a long tem-",62
NA,"porary stay. However, it is a temporary situation",62
NA,designed to enable conversion to other energy,63
NA,sources to take place. There may well be no need,63
NA,to convert appliances. One may well be able to,63
NA,go back to gas made from coal. In my area,63
NA,detailed studies are proceeding into the use of,63
NA,surplus gas from coal mines. Following the,63
NA,"Appin tragedy, in which only last year some",63
NA,miners were killed as a result of a gas explosion,63
NA,"underground, the coal companies in particular",63
NA,have been considering very seriously trapping,63
NA,underground methane gas with a view to,63
NA,reticulating it or distributing it in bottled form.,63
NA,least it is an alternative energy source.,63
NA,If we review what the subsidy has achieved it,63
NA,becomes very clear that it has been of major,63
NA,benefit to people in country towns. The average,63
NA,gas consumer uses about half a tonne of gas a,63
NA,year. The ex-refinery price of LPG has been cut,63
NA,"from $252 a tonne to $125 a tonne, or by $127 a",63
NA,"tonne. Thus, the price has been cut by more than",63
NA,half. If one uses half a tonne of gas a year simple,63
NA,mathematics would indicate that the average gas,63
NA,consumer will benefit by some $60 a year. That,63
NA,will chop some $15 a quarter from each quarterly,63
NA,bill. I am certain that the pensioners about whom,63
NA,the honourable member for Hughes expressed,63
NA,such concern-bu t for whom he was prepared to,63
NA,"do nothing, of course-i n my area will benefit",63
NA,significantly from such a cut in their gas bills. I,63
NA,must say that I am very grateful indeed to the,63
NA,Government for its having yielded to our strong,63
NA,pressure at this level.,63
NA,There has been immense disagreement within,63
NA,gas-using councils about what should be done.,63
NA,Many local councillors have claimed that since,63
NA,we are exporting three-quarters of current pro-,63
NA,duction LPG is not a scarce resource; that this in-,63
NA,dicates an enormous surplus; that LPG should,63
NA,not be the subject of a scarcity price. Unfortuopportunity,63
NA,"nately, perhaps many local councillors are",63
NA,pared to let their judgment be clouded by their,63
NA,wish for re-election. LPG is scarce in the,63
NA,and does enjoy a scarcity price. It is to be used,63
NA,premium purposes. People are willing to pay,63
NA,large amounts of money to use it as an alternasioner,63
NA,"tive to petrol, not as an alternative",63
NA,ral gas or electricity. It has a premium use as an,63
NA,alternative to petroleum.,63
NA,"Therefore, let us hit right on the head",63
NA,gestion that Australia has a surplus of LPG. member.,63
NA,Some is being exported because a large amount,63
NA,of it is produced automatically,63
NA,"the petroleum process, both ex-wells and, of",63
NA,"course, ex-refineries. One has it whether one sets",63
NA,"out to produce it or not. Certainly, at the moment",63
NA,three-quarters of LPG production is exported,63
NA,"but, again, it is earning Australia foreign",63
NA,"exchange which, in turn, is helping to meet the",63
NA,huge increases in the price of the oil that we im-,63
NA,port. On that simple basis it is directly substitut-,63
NA,able for imported oil. We export LPG; we import,63
NA,"oil. If that is not a sensible thing to do, I would be",63
NA,pleased if members of councils who are listening,63
NA,to tonight's debate could explain to me why it is,63
NA,"not. Even more particularly, its internal substitut-",63
NA,"able role is increasing, firstly, in automotive use",63
NA,"and, secondly, of course, as a feedstock for",63
NA,various petrochemical uses. There is no doubt at,63
NA,At all that many sections of the petrochemical in-,63
NA,dustry are violently opposed to the use of LPG as,63
NA,"a car fuel because, they say, there will not be",63
NA,enough of it and because conversions are never,63
NA,really satisfactory. The editorial in the Plastics,63
NA,Digest of March of this year states:,63
NA,Certainly LPG would be an excellent fuel for appropri-,63
NA,ately designed spark ignition engines and appropriately de-,63
NA,signed cars. Its use would also reduce the emission of pol-,63
NA,lutants. But LPG is best used as a feed stock and not as a car,63
NA,fuel.,63
NA,It goes on to explain in great detail why that is so.,63
NA,"However, it concludes in this way:",63
NA,"Without a guarantee of LPG supply, the security of feed",63
NA,stock necessary for the huge expansions in petrochemical,63
NA,manufacturing capacity now under way in Australia will be,63
NA,lacking.,63
NA,That is a very serious problem. This industry des-,63
NA,perately needs Australian LPG. To continue a,63
NA,policy which encouraged the wasteful use of,63
NA,LPG would be to the disadvantage of the whole,63
NA,of our nation.,63
Mr KEATING ,Yo u have just reduced the price,63
NA,by $50 a tonne. What are you talking about?,63
Mr BAUME,Tha t is why this subsidy is of a,63
NA,temporary nature and is aimed specifically at,63
NA,providing councils and consumers with the,63
NA,to convert to alternative energy,63
NA,presupplies without placing an unfair burden on,63
NA,"consumers, particularly the pensioners. The in-",63
NA,world terjection from the honourable member for,63
NA,for Blaxland is interesting. Are we to take it from,63
NA,that interjection that he believes that the pen-,63
NA,consumers of gas in country towns should,63
NA,"to wood, natube penalised?",63
Mr BAILLIEU ,Tha t is what he is saying.,63
Mr BAUME,Certainl y it is what he appears,63

Mr BAUME,Or a point of argument?,63
Mr KEATING , I claim to have been misrep-,63

NA,the end of the honourable member's speech.,63
Mr BAUME, I must say that I find these,64
NA,phoney points of order particularly displeasing,64
NA,and an abuse of the procedures of the,64

Mr BAUME,Tha t table demonstrates very,64
NA,clearly that only one per cent of Australia's fossil,64
NA,fuel reserves are in fact in petroleum and that,64
NA,"about one per cent are in LPG. So, there is no",64
NA,doubt that any incentive to waste this resource,64
NA,would be a foolish long term policy. There is no,64
NA,doubt that this Government is not setting off on,64
NA,such a poUcy. It is setting off on a very clear pol-,64
NA,icy to provide specific assistance for a limited,64
NA,amount of time to consumers who would other-,64
NA,"wise receive, I beUeve, a rough deal. There is no",64
NA,"doubt that the high price of LPG, in particular in",64
NA,"exports, is to the benefit of the whole of",64
NA,"Australia. As a result, the people who receive the",64
NA,whole of that benefit-al l Australians-ar e pro-,65
NA,viding at small cost to them a subsidy to a small,65
NA,group of Australians who are being specifically,65
NA,disadvantaged. If all AustraUans are getting the,65
NA,"benefit of this high LPG price, particularly in",65
NA,"terms of exports, why should the burden fully hit",65
NA,one small group just because they live in country,65
NA,"towns and just because the Labor Party, whose",65
NA,"policies have been continually anti-country,",65
NA,hates people who live in the country?,65
NA,The objections ofthe honourable member for,65
NA,Blaxland to what we are doing now in providing,65
NA,this specific benefit is another example of the,65
NA,ways in which the honourable member for,65
NA,Blaxland and his colleagues find the country de-,65
NA,testable because the people in the country have,65
NA,rejected them continually at elections. If we look,65
NA,at the state of representation in this House we,65
NA,will see how very few country members are on,65
NA,the Labor side. I am very glad indeed that this,65
NA,Government is not only alert to the problems of,65
NA,country people but also is prepared to do some-,65
NA,"thing positive, as has happened in this case,",65
NA,when a clear disadvantage is being suffered by,65
NA,country people. I concede that in some areas,65
NA,"there have been slight errors. For example, to en-",65
NA,courage the industrial use of LPG for fuel was an,65
NA,error. I am quite prepared to accept that the,65
NA,Government made a shght error in that area.,65
NA,That is why I am glad to see this policy now of di-,65
NA,verting its use entirely as an industrial feed stock.,65
NA,I recognise that no subsidy is involved in that,65
NA,"area, that the price is to come down to $205 a",65
NA,tonne.,65
Mr KEATING ,Ther e is for industry.,65
Mr BAUME,The subsidy relates specifically,65
NA,"to country gas consumers in households, the",65
NA,"dinary people of Australia, the pensioners of",65
NA,electorate. They are the people to whom I,65
NA,proud to say in this House: ' I have fought for,65
NA,your special subsidy to reduce the price of your,65
NA,gas'. I am interested to hear that interjections,65
NA,from the Opposition indicate that the Labor,65
NA,Party is opposed to what I have done and compenalty,65
NA,plains about my success. I commend this Bill,65
NA,the House.,65
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! The,65
NA,honourable member'stimehas expired.,65
Mr KEATING ,Blaxland)- Mr Deputy,65
NA,"Speaker, I claim to have been misrepresented by",65
NA,the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr,65
NA,Baume).,65
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,The honourable,65
NA,member may proceed.,65
Mr KEATING,I f the honourable member,65
NA,had been in the House before the suspension of,65
NA,the sitting for dinner he would have understood,65
NA,that the Labor Party is supporting the measure,65
NA,which provides for the $80 a tonne subsidy. I,65
NA,indicated then that the Labor Party believes that,65
NA,there should be a subsidy to people resident in,65
NA,the country areas. I also indicated that it was the,65
NA,Government which put up the price in the first,65
NA,place.,65
Mr BAUME ,Wher e have I misrepresented,65
NA,you?,65
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order!,65
Mr KEATING,Th e honourable member,65
NA,misrepresented me by saying-,65
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! If the,65
NA,honourable member for Macarthur wishes to,65
NA,"take a point of order, he should stand and take it.",65
Mr BAUME , I take a point of order. It is that,65
NA,one is not entitled to debate an issue when claim-,65
NA,ing that one has been misrepresented. One is sup-,65
NA,posed to state where the misrepresentation,65
NA,occurred.,65
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,"As I understand it,",65
NA,"the honourable member for Blaxland, at this",65
NA,"early stage in his personal explanation, is",65
NA,"attempting to point out, I hope, the extent to",65
NA,which he has been personally misrepresented.,65
Mr KEATING, I can do so at the third read-,65
NA,"ing stage if honourable members opposite wish,",65
NA,but i f i do it now it will probably take less time.,65
Mr BAILLIEU ,Don' t debate it.,65
Mr KEATING," Mr Deputy Speaker, if you",65
NA,could quieten the idiot child of the establishment,65
NA,oropposite I might be able to finish. The honour-,65
NA,my able member for Macarthur alleged falsely that I,65
NA,am was opposed to the $80 a tonne subsidy being,65
NA,"paid to country people. That is untrue, lu a few",65
NA,minutes we on this side of the House will support,65
NA,"the measure, with the Government. We believe",65
NA,that there should be some relief from the harsh,65
NA,the Government has inflicted upon these,65
NA,to people by raising the price of LPG to country,65
NA,people by 350 per cent in 12 months.,65
Mr BAILLIEU ,H e is debating it.,65
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! It is normal,65
NA,for an honourable member who is seeking to,65
NA,take a point of order to stand and to do so.,65
Mr KEATING, I was misrepresented further,65
NA,by the honourable member for Macarthur when,65
NA,he indicated that my claim that the Government,65
NA,had reduced the price to industry was untrue.,65
NA,This is not the case. In fact the Government has,65
NA,reduced the price of a fuel which he says is valu-,66
NA,able and which should be rationed by $50 a,66
NA,"tonne to industry, although it has charged the",66
NA,full price to the petrochemical industry. The,66
NA,petrochemical industry would be the worse for,66
NA,wear as a result of sales under subsidy to the rest,66
NA,of Australian industry.,66
Mr BAUME , I take a point of order. I under-,66
NA,stood that personal explanations had to relate to,66
NA,"the facts. As I understand it, the alleged fact",66
NA,which the honourable member for Blaxland has,66
NA,put forward is untrue. I said that there was no,66
NA,Federal Government subsidy as against a sub-,66
NA,sidy to domestic consumers.,66
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,The honourable,66
NA,member for Macarthur has made his point quite,66
NA,clearly. I would suggest that the honourable,66
NA,member for Blaxland confine himself to the,66
NA,extent to which he claims to have been,66
NA,misrepresented by the honourable member for,66
NA,Macarthur. I f the honourable member for La,66
NA,Trobe does not desist while I am speaking I will,66
NA,be forced to deal with him.,66
Mr KEATING," Mr Deputy Speaker, I will",66
NA,wind up on this point. The honourable member,66
NA,for Macarthur claimed that the Opposition,66
NA,opposed this measure. It does not. It supports the,66
NA,subsidy for country people. But the Government,66
NA,in the first place lifted the price by 350 per cent,66
NA,from $80 a tonne to $250 a tonne in 14 months.,66
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! The,66
NA,honourable member is now debating the issue.,66
Mr WALLIS ,Grey) (9.1)-The honourable,66
NA,member for Macarthur ( Mr Baume) mentioned,66
NA,the reduction that these Bills will achieve in the,66
NA,price of liquefied petroleum gas.,66
Mr BAILLIEU ,Th e idiot from Blaxland ought,66
NA,to go home and read up what his members are,66
NA,saying.,66
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! The,66
NA,honourable member for La Trobe will restrain,66
NA,himself.,66
Mr BAILLIEU ,A n idiot Uke that-,66
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order!,66
Mr WALLIS,O f course he did not say that,66
NA,the government through the Prices Justification,66
NA,Tribunal allowed the price of LPG torisecon-,66
NA,siderably. It then took some of the weight off .the,66
NA,country towns with the $80 a tonne subsidy. The,66
NA,honourable member for Macarthur made some,66
NA,rather scathing remarks about members on this,66
NA,side of the House. He referred to how we hate,66
NA,country people. As one who represents one of the,66
NA,"large country electorates, I think I can deny his",66
NA,assertion. The people of Grey have continually,66
NA,returned me to this House despite the many pre-,66
NA,dictions by Liberal Party pundits about how they,66
NA,would get me knocked off. But the country,66
NA,people still stick with me and return me to this,66
NA,place. I think I can fairly say that T represent,66
NA,country people. I represent a large country elec-,66
NA,torate and not a pocket borough such as the elec-,66
NA,torate of Macarthur.,66
NA,The honourable member for Macarthur also,66
NA,made mention of government policy. Govern-,66
NA,"ment policy in the area of petrol, petroleum,",66
NA,LPG and energy generally has been a bit like the,66
NA,Government's Medibank policy. There have,66
NA,been so many changes that any resemblance to,66
NA,what it was 12 months ago is pure coincidence. I,66
NA,think it can be said that the Government has a,66
NA,complete lack of policy because of the changes,66
NA,that have taken place. The Government an-,66
NA,nounced in the Budget the year before last a cer-,66
NA,tain policy. Within a few months it changed that,66
NA,poUcy. The policy has since been changed again.,66
NA,I think we can all say that in many respects the,66
NA,Government's poUcy is a non-policy because the,66
NA,Government certainly does know in which way it,66
NA,is heading. It would appear that the Govern-,66
NA,ment's supposed policy is oriented towards bal-,66
NA,ancing its Budget problems than to conserving a,66
NA,scarce resource and all of the other claims that,66
NA,the Government has made.,66
NA,Much has been said about how the Govern-,66
NA,ment's policy hits country people. I fully agree,66
NA,that the present energy policy does hit country,66
NA,people. A colleague in the Senate the other night,66
NA,said:,66
NA,The most recent available survey of the Australian Bureau,66
NA,of Statistics on household expenditure shows that rural,66
NA,households in the lowest stratification ofincome spent nearly,66
NA,"10 per cent of their income on petrol, oil and lubricants. For",66
NA,all households the comparable figure is just less than 3 per,66
NA,cent. In other words this policy espoused by the National,66
NA,Countiy Party in particular penalises the lowest income,66
NA,countiy households three times as much as it penalises the,66
NA,community in general.,66
NA,I think that indicates what the Government's,66
NA,policy does. The Government's decision to offer,66
NA,a subsidy was brought about more by fear of a,66
NA,reaction in the forthcoming election than it was,66
NA,by genuine concern for country people. People,66
NA,on the Government side of the House are always,66
NA,saying how they represent country people. But,66
NA,the country people are beginning to learn that it,66
NA,"is this very Government, the very people who are",66
NA,"supposed to represent them, that is hitting them",66
NA,the hardest. This is certainly the case in respect of,66
NA,the Government's energy policy. Certainly the,66
NA,Government's action is governed by the fact that,66
NA,it is in a little bit of political trouble. The honour-,66
NA,able member for Macarthur said that he had got,66
NA,a group together to go to the Government to try,67
NA,to get it to change its policy. Why? Government,67
NA,members realise that if the Government does not,67
NA,change its policy they will be in political trouble.,67
NA,One should look at the whole question of pet-,67
NA,rol pricing in the country areas generally. The,67
NA,Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs ( Mr,67
NA,Garland) answered a question that I put to him a,67
NA,week ago in respect of the freight subsidy. I re-,67
NA,alise that the Minister said that the Federal,67
NA,Government's freight subsidy applies only to the,67
NA,freight costs and that the Government will pick,67
NA,up the tab for any costs over 0.44c a litre. We,67
NA,"would normally assume that the country person,",67
NA,"irrespective of where he was in Australia, would",67
NA,pay only 0.44c a litre more for petrol than would,67
NA,"his city counterpart. But, of course, that is far",67
NA,from the fact. I was in Adelaide at Easter and,67
NA,"petrol in that city was selling for 31,2c a litre.",67
NA,less than 200 miles away in Port Augusta-w e,67
NA,should remember the promise of 0.44c a litre-,67
NA,petrol is selling for 37.7c a litre. So there is a,67
NA,difference of 6.5c a litre which in the old,67
NA,measurement is the equivalent of 30c a gallon. I,67
NA,do not know who is responsible. I do not know,67
NA,whether it is the PJT or the oil companies. I,67
NA,would possibly blame the oil companies mostly,67
NA,for this because our friend the honourable,67
NA,member for FrankUn ( Mr Goodluck) pointed,67
NA,out the way in which the oil companies have,67
NA,treated service station owners for quite some,67
NA,time. I think the oil companies can take part of,67
NA,the blame for this.,67
NA,This Government has in its hands the report of,67
NA,the Royal Commission on Petroleum. The fourth,67
NA,volume of that report deals with petroleum mar-,67
NA,keting. There is sufficient in that fourth report to,67
NA,give the Government guidelines as to what,67
NA,should be done to make sure that not only the,67
NA,public but also the service station owners are,67
NA,given a fair go. Figures show that possibly the,67
NA,highest number of businessmen who go through,67
NA,the bankruptcy court are the service station,67
NA,owners. This is mainly because the oil companies,67
NA,tie these people up in respect of leases. There are,67
NA,many other bad arrangements between the ser-,67
NA,vice station lessees and the oil companies. Not,67
NA,only do we have the Government taking us for a,67
NA,ride with its oil pricing policy but also the oil,67
NA,companies are taking us for a ride too.,67
NA,It is a fact that the price of petrol has increased,67
NA,by 150 per cent since this Government came to,67
NA,power. 70 per cent of that increase goes back to,67
NA,the Government in excise. If we look at the,67
NA,figures properly we will see that the actual cost of,67
NA,production of petrol is somewhere in the vicinity,67
NA,of $2 a barrel. The producer receives $6 a barrel,67
NA,"and the Government takes, in all, about $ 19 a",67
NA,barrel. This Government has always claimed,67
NA,that it is a low tax government. But its petrol,67
NA,pricing policy makes it a very high tax govern-,67
NA,ment. The application of the Government's oil,67
NA,policy has added about 23 per cent to taxation,67
NA,generally. It is not fair taxation. The level of tax is,67
NA,not determined on a sliding scale. It is not like in-,67
NA,come tax under which people pay according to,67
NA,what they earn. If a pensioner pulls into one side,67
NA,of a petrol pump and a millionaire pulls into the,67
NA,other they both pay the same. So this is a very in-,67
NA,equitable and unfair type of taxation. It is,67
NA,directed more towards balancing the Govern-,67
NA,ment's budgetary considerations than it is to car-,67
NA,rying out the Government's stated policy.,67
NA,I mentioned that the price of LPG went from,67
NA,$80 a tonne to $252 a tonne over a very short,67
NA,But period. This legislation will reduce that amount,67
NA,to some consumers by $80 a tonne. Again I say,67
NA,that this decision was taken mainly to get some,67
NA,National Country Party and Liberal Party,67
NA,people in country electorates off the hook be-,67
NA,cause they will certainly feel a political reaction,67
NA,when the election is held later this year. I under-,67
NA,stand that the value of the increased subsidy will,67
NA,be eroded if the oil companies make an appli-,67
NA,cation to the Prices Justification Tribunal to raise,67
NA,the price of petrol a little further.,67
NA,I would also like to make mention of one other,67
NA,matter in respect of the Government's petrol,67
NA,pricing policy. I have mentioned that I represent,67
NA,a large country electorate. Aircraft play an im-,67
NA,"portant role in such areas. Again, it is something",67
NA,which has a great effect on the country dweller. I,67
NA,refer to the great increase that has taken place in,67
NA,the price of avgas. In November 1975 when the,67
NA,Labor Government went out of office avgas was,67
NA,15 cents a litre. In August 1978 the cost of avgas,67
NA,had risen to 21 cents a litre and last month it was,67
NA,42 cents a litre. I worked out that the cost of,67
NA,keeping in the air a small twin-engined aircraft,67
NA,that I often use for charter purposes increased by,67
NA,$ 13 an hour. In these areas where the use of air-,67
NA,craft is very important country people have again,67
NA,been penalised by the fact that the price of com-,67
NA,muter operations has gone up considerably-i n,67
NA,most cases in the vicinity of 30 to 35 per cent-,67
NA,over the last six months. The cost of avgas has,67
NA,doubled in the last two years and it has trebled,67
NA,while this Government has been in power.,67
NA,"Distillate is, of course, of great importance to",67
NA,our rural industries. Look how its price has,67
NA,moved while the Fraser Government has been in,67
NA,power. In November 1975 when the Labor,67
NA,Government went out of office it was 7.7 cents a,67
NA,"litre, in August 1978 it was 11.7 cents a litre, and",67
NA,in April 1980 it had increased to 24.8 cents a litre.,68
NA,One can imagine the effect that that has had on,68
NA,many of our rural industries. This affects not only,68
NA,our rural industries. In my electorate there are,68
NA,"two centres, probably the largest opal mining",68
NA,"centres in the world, Andamooka and Coober",68
NA,"Pedy, where distillate is used by all the machin-",68
NA,ery. It is in great demand. The people there go,68
NA,"through bad periods, and they are going through",68
NA,"a bad period at present, but they have suddenly",68
NA,struck this great increase in the cost of their,68
NA,late. This means that their operations are very,68
NA,much more difficult.,68
NA,Distillate is one of the main fuels used by local,68
NA,government. Local governments have their,68
NA,problems at present. These problems have been,68
NA,worsened by the increase in costs of fuel. This,68
NA,effectflowson to ratepayers and means that less,68
NA,work can be done. It certainly has a great effect,68
NA,on people serving in local government and those,68
NA,officers who are responsible for administering,68
NA,local government. Again I say that the present,68
NA,government's policy is hitting hardest the,68
NA,country people-th e people whom the honour-,68
NA,able members on the other side of the House,68
NA,claim they represent. When the election is held,68
NA,later this year these things will be remembered. I,68
NA,"am sure there will be a reaction, irrespective of",68
NA,the fact that the Government has just knocked,68
NA,$80 a tonne off LPG prices for certain users in,68
NA,country areas. Country people will make their,68
NA,voices well and truly heard.,68
NA,The honourable member for Blaxland ( Mr,68
NA,Keating) stated earlier the Labor Party's fuel,68
NA,policy. He indicated that we would break the,68
NA,present nexus between our domestic prices and,68
NA,the price of Arabian Ught crude. The price of pet-,68
NA,rol would be frozen for a period of 12 months,68
NA,and then would be tied to movements in the price,68
NA,of LPG. Labor's policy would take off at least,68
NA,some of the strain that people are feeling today,68
NA,because of the petrol pricing policy and would,68
NA,help to make life a little easier for them. I am,68
NA,sure that when people examine this matter,68
NA,thoroughly they will realise that that policy does,68
NA,"have something for them, and that they will re-",68
NA,turn the Labor Government at the end of the,68
NA,"year. Further to that policy, there is the plan to",68
NA,establish a hydrocarbon corporation to carry out,68
NA,an oversight of the search for further petroleum,68
NA,reserves. It would assist where possible and give,68
NA,a general line as to which way our search,68
NA,program should be going.,68
NA,At the moment the program is rather willyequivalent,68
NA,"nilly. We have a few big projects, but there seems",68
NA,to be no overall direction to Australia's policy.,68
NA,"Much has been said about how, during the term",68
NA,"of the Labor Government, the number of wells",68
NA,drilled dropped considerably. I am sure the,68
NA,figures that have been given in this House on a,68
NA,number of occasions by the honourable member,68
NA,for Blaxland and by other members indicate that,68
NA,that is definitely not true. In the three years that,68
NA,the Labor Government was in office more wells,68
NA,were drilled than in the first three years of office,68
NA,of the present Government. I understand that at,68
NA,"present, of our two oil rigs, the Ocean Endeavour",68
NA,"distiland the Ocean Digger, one has already gone",68
NA,overseas and one is ready to go overseas in the,68
NA,not too distant future.,68
NA,We are not opposing this legislation. We feel,68
NA,that the payment of the $80 subsidy will give at,68
NA,least some relief to country people. We hope that,68
NA,the Government will be a bit more sympathetic,68
NA,across the board than it is now and take some of,68
NA,the weight off the Australian people.,68
Mr CADMAN ,Mitchell) (9.16)- I will not,68
NA,keep the House long. Some aspects of the use of,68
NA,liquefied petroleum gas are essential to fuel con-,68
NA,servation and the effective and sensible use of,68
NA,fuels in Australia. No doubt the House is well,68
NA,aware that liquefied petroleum gas is sourced,68
NA,mainly from oil drilling facilities off-shore and it,68
NA,is also a by-product of the refining industry. It,68
NA,has many uses. It is a premium fuel because it,68
NA,"burns cleanly, as does natural gas. It can be",68
NA,transported in liquid form. Before the energy,68
NA,crisis liquid petroleum fuels were abundant and,68
NA,"cheap. Therefore, liquefied petroleum gas did",68
NA,not compete amongst them because of the higher,68
NA,transport and storage costs involved.,68
NA,"Today, however, this situation has changed.",68
NA,Liquefied petroleum gas and oil fuels are ex-,68
NA,tremely valuable and important to the nation's,68
NA,future. The Government's policy decision is vital,68
NA,if we are to conserve all petroleum products. Not,68
NA,only have we adopted a policy of world parity,68
NA,"pricing for oil products produced in Australia,",68
NA,but we have also adopted a policy which locks in,68
NA,LP gas with the price of oil. There is no doubt,68
NA,that the Government's decision to reduce the,68
NA,common maximum price for propane and,68
NA,butane by $205 per tonne will bring significant,68
NA,changes in fuel uses in Australia and provide a,68
NA,more balanced approach to the conservation and,68
NA,use of fuel. Producers of Uquefied petroleum gas,68
NA,will also be expected to supply first the domestic,68
NA,market with liquefied petroleum gas. For users in,68
NA,Australia this ensures that there will be an ongo-,68
NA,ing reliable supply priced at half the price of,68
NA,petrol products. The new prices will,68
NA,mean approximately a 50 per cent differential in,68
NA,relation to petrol for motorists in the Melbourne,68
NA,"market, and a similar situation in Sydney. Also,",68
NA,the highest priority use for LP gas in the days to,69
NA,come must be for motor vehicles. The transport,69
NA,"field offers the greatest benefit from, and the",69
NA,"most sensible use of, liquefied petroleum gas.",69
NA,Future price increases in liquefied petroleum gas,69
NA,will be linked with percentage increases in,69
NA,"indigenous crude oil prices, giving the capacity",69
NA,for motorists to purchase a fuel that is tied to a,69
NA,price differential of approximately 50 per cent of,69
NA,the price of petrol.,69
NA,Another by-product of the Government's de-,69
NA,cision is that there will be an encouragement for,69
NA,the wasteful use of LPG in industry to be stopped,69
NA,and for industrial users to start to consider use,69
NA,"alternative fuels. Therefore, it seems to me that",69
NA,in major areas of policy the Government has,69
NA,found a very sensible and commendable answer,69
NA,to the problems created by an unexpected price,69
NA,rise brought about by a decision of the Prices Jus-,69
NA,tification Tribunal. The recent price rise in,69
NA,liquefied petroleum gas was brought about be-,69
NA,cause the Prices Justification Tribunal chose to,69
NA,pick a price for it which it saw as a world parity,69
NA,"price, which was in fact a spot export market",69
NA,price. This was an unfortunate decision because,69
NA,it was not consistent with the Government's pol-,69
NA,"icy on oil pricing. Therefore, the Government",69
NA,has moved to readjust the balance between these,69
NA,fuels and so gain a longer term use and a more,69
NA,sensible use of these products.,69
NA,The transport use of liquefied petroleum gas,69
NA,can be extended into many areas but mainly in,69
NA,today's world we are looking to large fleet,69
NA,owners and people who travel long distances to,69
NA,take advantage of liquefied petroleum gas. If it is,69
NA,possible as a nation to use our fuel correctly to,69
NA,"enable the ledger to be balanced, we will extend",69
NA,the use of liquefied petroleum gas to 14 per cent,69
NA,"of total transport fuel needs. In other terms, this",69
NA,will mean that for every six years use by motor-,69
NA,"ists we will save, as a nation, one year of petrol",69
NA,"and LPG. In current terms, the implementation",69
NA,of this policy alone will mean that by 1985 we,69
NA,will have a saving of one year's supply of petrol,69
NA,and LPG for use. There are other factors in re-,69
NA,gard to liquefied petroleum gas of which this,69
NA,Parliament and other parliaments in Australia,69
NA,need to be aware.,69
NA,The most efficient emission control system is,69
NA,achieved by the conversion of a motor car to,69
NA,"LPG. At a conversion cost of $700 to $1,000 a",69
NA,car can be adapted to produce an emission which,69
NA,is so clean that there is no comparison between,69
NA,that emission and the emission produced by pet-,69
NA,"rol fuels. The nitrous oxides, hydrocarbons and",69
NA,the carbon monoxide produced by LPG are sig-,69
NA,nificantly lower than those of petrol. Also LPG,69
NA,contains no lead. The lead content factor in pet-,69
NA,rol is causing concern in the community. Added,69
NA,"to the advantage that LPG has in this respect,",69
NA,travelling costs are halved. The cost of LPG as,69
NA,presently pegged by the Government will halve,69
NA,the cost of trips by largefleetowners. They will,69
NA,be able over a period to write off the cost of con-,69
NA,version which can be recovered by most owners,69
NA,"in 15,000 to 20,000 kilometres.",69
NA,"What this nation needs to do, instead of adopt-",69
NA,ing the crazy proposals of the New South Wales,69
NA,Government to move to the third stage of Aus-,69
NA,"tralian Design Rule 27A, is to encourage large",69
NA,of fleet owners to adopt the use of alternate fuels,69
NA,such as liquefied petroleum gas and diesolene.,69
NA,"By doing this, the motorists of the nations would",69
NA,be saved significant costs which in the first place,69
NA,would be borne by manufacturers. Motor ve-,69
NA,hicles which use petrol more efficiently will be,69
NA,produced. They will be allowed to tack on,69
NA,emission control devices which increase the con-,69
NA,sumption of fuel. There would be two savings to,69
NA,the motorist if this nation did not adopt Aus-,69
NA,tralian Design Rule 27A. The advantage to the,69
NA,"average motorist will be, firstly, that the price of",69
NA,cars will not increase because of the cost of,69
NA,"emission control additions to the car and, sec-",69
NA,"ondly, travel each kilometre will be cheaper as",69
NA,fuel emission devices increase fuel use by up to,69
NA,10 percent.,69
NA,The decision taken by the New South Wales,69
NA,Government appears to fly in the face of the,69
NA,advice given by the State Pollution Control Com-,69
NA,mission which indicates that the emission and,69
NA,level of pollution by motor vehicles in Sydney,69
NA,will remain constant until 1985. The increase in,69
NA,pollution in Sydney is caused by hydrocarbons,69
NA,emitted from other sources such as manufactur-,69
NA,ing sources. They will be responsible for an in-,69
NA,crease of 122 per cent in the level of hydro-,69
NA,"carbons in the Sydney atmosphere. Therefore, I",69
NA,commend these proposals to the House because,69
NA,they provide the motorist with a cheaper source,69
NA,of fuel which is pollution-free. They will be seen,69
NA,by the community at large to be sensible in,69
NA,extending the use of oil products. I commend this,69
NA,legislation to the House. I commend the Govern-,69
NA,ment for its decisions because I think they are,69
NA,some of the most sensible decisions on fuel usage,69
NA,and fuel conservation.,69
Mr JOHN BROWN ,Parramatta) (9.26)- I,69
NA,wish to spend a few minutes talking about the,69
NA,Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Grants) Bill 1980 and,69
NA,the Excise TariffAmendment Bill (No. 3) 1980.,69
NA,The debate on the legislation has been wide,69
NA,ranging. I represent an outer western suburbs,69
NA,electorate in Sydney. In view of what other,69
NA,speakers have said in this debate I think it is,70
NA,reasonable for me to spend a few moments deal-,70
NA,ing with petrol pricing. I think that the taxpayers,70
NA,"of Australia, particularly the people in my elec-",70
NA,"torate, should bear in mind that for seven years",70
NA,Australians paid $2 a barrel for Bass Strait oil.,70
NA,Most of that oil was discovered in 1968 and cer-,70
NA,tainly all of it was discovered before 1975. The,70
NA,Australian public is now paying in excess of $25,70
NA,a barrel for the same indigenous Australian oil.,70
NA,"The differential-tha t is, 83 per cent of the value",70
NA,of the oil-goe s to the Australian Government by,70
NA,way of petrol tax.,70
NA,I hope that when Australians fill their petrol,70
NA,tanks- I might add that 90 per cent of petrol and,70
NA,motor distillate used in Australia comes from in-,70
NA,digenous sources and 70 per cent of our oil re-,70
NA,serves comes from indigenous sources-an d pay,70
NA,the enormous price that they are paying for pet-,70
NA,rol at the moment they will realise that that price,70
NA,"has been set by the Fraser Government, not as",70
NA,the Government wants people to believe by,70
NA,some cartel of mysterious Arabs who sit at,70
NA,different venues and decide what we will pay for,70
NA,"petrol. The price for Australian petrol, to the",70
NA,"great cost to the Australian people, is set by the",70
NA,Australian Government. I think it is time that the,70
NA,"deception that has been promulgated,",70
NA,expounded and reinforced by this Government,70
NA,was unmasked. The Government has said that,70
NA,the high price of Australian petrol is due to an,70
NA,Arab decision. It is not. It is the result of,70
NA,scious decision by this Government to use petrol,70
NA,as a means of raising revenue. There is no doubt,70
NA,that this Government has an insatiable thirst for,70
NA,revenue. It has used that petrol tax derived rev-,70
NA,enue to reduce its domestic deficit to the level,70
NA,which it now tells us is a measure of its great,70
NA,efficiency as an economic manager. We on this,70
NA,side ofthe House know that this is not the case. I,70
NA,think that at this stage the Australian public,70
NA,knows that that is not the case.,70
NA,I wonder what would have happened to the,70
NA,Government's domestic deficit if the Arabs had,70
NA,not decided a couple of years ago to increase,70
NA,their oil prices to the current level. What a great,70
NA,windfall this has been for the Government. This,70
NA,is a Government of opportunistic buccaneers,70
NA,who are prepared to soak the working class-th,70
NA,people who have to put some petrol in their,70
NA,"to get to work-i n order to fuel the economy, in",70
NA,order to reduce the deficit to the level that,70
NA,Government now trumpets as being a major course,70
NA,reason for its claim that it is a great economic,70
NA,manager.,70
NA,When this Government talks about reducing,70
NA,"the deficit, it is in fact running down",70
NA,"asset to achieve income. By definition, that in-",70
NA,come will cease because it is a tax on pre-1975,70
NA,"oil. When this oil runs out, as eventually it must",70
NA,"in the mid 1980s, what will the Government do",70
NA,to replace the revenue that it has gained in this,70
NA,windfall fashion from the increase that the Arabs,70
NA,made in prices of their oil? I wonder what will,70
NA,"happen when the $3,000m windfall that this",70
NA,Government has been able to expropriate from,70
NA,the Australian public expires in the mid-1980s?,70
NA,What will the Government do then to meet the,70
NA,vacuum in government funding to which it has,70
NA,become accustomed? There is no way that this,70
NA,Government or any government which is in,70
NA,power in the mid-1980s will be able to slow,70
NA,down the express train nature of government,70
NA,spending. The Government has become accus-,70
NA,"tomed to this $3,000m of excess revenue every",70
NA,year. There is no way in the world that the,70
NA,Government will find a way to replace that rev-,70
NA,enue when it expires.,70
NA,This Government's misguided pricing policy,70
NA,imposes a very heavy burden on the Australian,70
NA,public. The Government has added 3 per cent to,70
NA,the national inflation figure just by virtue of its,70
NA,petrol pricing policies. These days to fill up the,70
NA,"petrol tank of an ordinary, average family car",70
NA,costs $25. Because of the lack of public transport,70
NA,and because of the urban spread which is Syd-,70
NA,"ney, there is no way in the world that the average",70
NA,a conworker in my electorate in the western area of,70
NA,Sydney can get to work without driving his car. I,70
NA,know of many people in my electorate who have,70
NA,to fill up their petrol tanks twice a week just to,70
NA,get to work to earn the money that they need to,70
NA,feed their families. They are looking at $50 a,70
NA,week just to get to work-an d they do not have,70
NA,an alternative.,70
NA,Furthermore there is no way in the world that,70
NA,those people can get any relief under the income,70
NA,tax laws as they exist. We all know that the,70
NA,"middle class, the company executive and the self-",70
NA,employed have a lurk to get out of paying the,70
NA,increased petrol prices. They are either leasing a,70
NA,car and claiming those charges as a taxation de-,70
NA,"duction or driving a company car, a perk pro-",70
NA,e vided by their corporation. The ordinary work-,70
NA,"cars ing man, the man earning $7,000, $8,000 or",70
NA,"$10,000 a year is stuck with the fact that he is up",70
NA,the for $50 a week for his petrol and he has no re-,70
NA,to any reduction in his taxation. The prob-,70
NA,lem is that this Government is getting over,70
NA,"$3,000m a year from petrol taxes. Because of the",70
NA,lack of public transport in my area people are,70
NA,a national stuck with high petrol bills.,70
NA,I would have thought that if this were a moral,71
NA,government at least it would have done some-,71
NA,thing about providing funds to the State govern-,71
NA,ments to improve the standard of public,71
NA,transport in the large urban areas. What do we,71
NA,find when we examine the facts? The facts are,71
NA,that in the years of this Government's reign,71
NA,Commonwealth receipts have gone up by 45 per,71
NA,cent but payments to the States for all purposes,71
NA,have increased by only 32 per cent. It is very ob-,71
NA,vious that the States do not have the money to,71
NA,improve the public transport system. If this,71
NA,"Government were sincere in claiming, as it does,",71
NA,that its petrol pricing policy is an energy conser-,71
NA,vation policy designed to reduce the con-,71
NA,"sumption of Australian fuel, surely good com-",71
NA,mercial sense would indicate that the,71
NA,Government should be improving public,71
NA,transport with Commonwealth funds in order to,71
NA,get people out of their motor cars. That is not the,71
NA,case. This Government has made every petrol,71
NA,pump an agent for the Taxation Office. There is,71
NA,no way in the world that any honourable,71
NA,"member opposite, including the honourable",71
NA,"member for Franklin ( Mr Goodluck), who used",71
NA,"to be a service station proprietor, could deny that",71
NA,that is a fact.,71
NA,The Government tries to market its oil pricing,71
NA,policy as an energy policy but it is not an energy,71
NA,policy; it is a tax policy. Nobody can deny that.,71
NA,The Government argues that its pricing policy is,71
NA,needed to encourage oil exploration. That is not,71
NA,"the case, as has been explained by the honour-",71
NA,able member for Blaxland ( Mr Keating) earlier,71
NA,in this debate. Since the Fraser Government,71
NA,came into power the amount of exploration in,71
NA,Australia has decreased. The statistics prove it.,71
NA,"This year Canada is sinking something like 3,000",71
NA,exploratory wells. In Australia it is a much,71
NA,smallerfigure-about 100. Honourable members,71
NA,opposite should not try to tell us that,71
NA,ment's oil pricing policy is designed to improve,71
NA,exploration in Australia. Thefiguresshow other-,71
NA,wise. Since this Government came into power the,71
NA,amount of exploration investment has decreased,71
NA,remarkably. So has its funding for public,71
NA,transport. That is very obvious.,71
NA,The Fraser Government promised lower tax-,71
NA,"ation and smaller government, but it is the",71
NA,highest taxing government since Federation.,71
NA,Government revenue from petrol in the present,71
NA,"financial year is $3,400m. This represents",71
NA,cent of total personal income tax revenue for this,71
NA,Government and more than the total receipts,71
NA,from company tax. Total government revenue,71
NA,figures show that this is the highest taxing,71
NA,government in Australian history. Nobody,71
NA,should think otherwise.,71
NA,"I will not go on for much longer, Mr Deputy",71
NA,"Speaker, because I know that you want to wind",71
NA,up the debate. Just allow me to tell you that i f,71
NA,this Government was really sincere about,71
NA,introducing its pricing policy to increase explo-,71
NA,"ration it has failed dismally. On the other hand, if",71
NA,"it tries to tell us and the Australian public, as it",71
NA,does that its policy is dedicated towards reducing,71
NA,"the consumption of fuel in Australia, it has failed",71
NA,to a grand degree in that area also. Petrol con-,71
NA,sumption in Australia keeps going up. The,71
NA,Government has done nothing in the form of tax,71
NA,"relief to improve the situation. For instance, it",71
NA,has not offered incentives to Australians to buy,71
NA,cars with less power as has been done in,71
NA,America. No inducement has been given to the,71
NA,motor companies to produce motors with a,71
NA,smaller capacity and a lower fuel consumption,71
NA,rate. There has been no improvement in funds,71
NA,for public transport. Certainly there has been no,71
NA,inducement for people to get out of their cars and,71
NA,to use public transport. This Government has,71
NA,failed dismally on all counts.,71
NA,The public of Australia must realise that no,71
NA,matter what reason this Government puts for-,71
NA,ward it is dedicated to its petrol pricing policy in,71
NA,order to increase government revenue. It has an,71
NA,insatiable appetite. Honourable members on the,71
NA,Opposition side of the House recognise this as,71
NA,being the case. Every week complaints stream,71
NA,into my office from people in my electorate who,71
NA,are forced to drive their motor cars to work and,71
NA,are forced to find $50 a week in order to get to,71
NA,work. The complaints are increasing. When,71
NA,honourable members opposite go to the ballot,71
NA,box in December-a s I presume they will-thi s,71
NA,will show up in the results. Let there be no mis-,71
NA,take. The Government's petrol pricing policy is a,71
NA,"the Governtax policy, not an energy policy.",71
Mr GARLAND ,Curtin-Minister for Business,71
NA,and Consumer Affairs) (9.37)-in reply-Th e,71
NA,attitudes expressed by the Australian Labor,71
NA,Party in this debate are very strange indeed. Lis-,71
NA,tening to honourable members opposite one can-,71
NA,not help being struck by the way in which they,71
NA,"have all differed from one another. With respect,",71
NA,the honourable member for Hughes ( Mr Les,71
NA,Johnson) really spoke a lot of nonsense. Appar-,71
NA,The ently he was unaware that what he was saying,71
NA,was in conflict to a very large degree with the re-,71
NA,30 per marks made by the honourable member for,71
NA,"Blaxland ( Mr Keating), who is the official Labor",71
NA,Party spokesman on energy matters in this,71
NA,chamber. The honourable member for Grey ( Mr,71
NA,Wallis) put some emphasis on what he saw as,71
NA,the unfairness of the type of tax involved. I point,72
NA,out that it is the same type of tax-tha t is equal,72
NA,incidence-tha t applied when the Labor Party,72
NA,was in government. A whole lot of other taxes,72
NA,"applied by State governments, including those of",72
NA,his own political persuasion-bu s fares and all,72
NA,sorts of other charges-ar e equal to the quantity.,72
NA,It is no use honourable members expecting every,72
NA,tax that is raised to be progressive. That is unreal.,72
NA,The Government has an oil and oil products,72
NA,parity pricing policy. I think the reason for that,72
NA,policy bears repeating briefly. There is a scarcity,72
NA,"of oil in the world, and that scarcity will not go",72
NA,away. Prices around the world are rising. We in,72
NA,Australia must take notice of that situation. Un-,72
NA,"less we discover more oil, and at present many",72
NA,"companies are looking for it, the day will come in",72
NA,the next decade- I hope it does not-whe n our,72
NA,present oil supplies run out. We will then have to,72
NA,import all our oil. There should be no mistaking,72
NA,that then we will be paying full prices for it.,72
NA,Oil has a value and liquefied petroleum gas,72
NA,has a value. The Liquefied Petroleum Gas,72
NA,(Grants) Bill and the Excise TariffAmendment,72
NA,Bill (No. 3) relate principally to liquefied pet-,72
NA,roleum gas. LPG has a value in the world. The,72
NA,"Australian economy has to adjust to that value,",72
NA,as do other economies throughout the world. We,72
NA,must conserve all the oil we can and convert to,72
NA,other forms of energy. Fortunately Australia has,72
NA,many alternative energy sources. We must make,72
NA,sure that the effect is felt throughout the econ-,72
NA,"omy just as it is overseas. Of course, honourable",72
NA,members know that in this country we pay less,72
NA,"by a margin for motor spirit, petrol and other oils",72
NA,than is paid in almost any other country. Never-,72
NA,"theless, we have seen tremendous pricerisesin",72
NA,Australia. They have occurred as a consequence,72
NA,of tremendous rises overseas. We have a present,72
NA,position of a shortage of oil and a future position,72
NA,of a shortage of liquefied petroleum gas.,72
NA,We had a very rapid rise in the price of,72
NA,liquefied petroleum gas as from December of,72
NA,last year-onl y a few months ago. Movements in,72
NA,the world price were as follows: It was $147 a,72
NA,tonne last December and it rose to $252 a tonne,72
NA,"in January. The Government, recognising that",72
NA,that was too sharp arisefor any reasonable con-,72
NA,"cern to adjust to, has come up with a package of",72
NA,proposals to allow for discounting for all con-,72
NA,"sumers except the petrochemical industry, from",72
NA,which there is a very rapid rise in demand. Con-,72
NA,sumers will receive a reduction in price from this,72
NA,package of proposals. What we have put in place,72
NA,of the price structure following this sharp,72
NA,increase-i t was announced by my colleague the,72
NA,Minister for National Development and Energy,72
NA,(Senator Carrick) about two weeks ago-i s a,72
NA,"three tier structure. Firstly, there will be a sub-",72
NA,"sidy of $80 a tonne, principally for those con-",72
NA,sumers in country areas and those whose use of it,72
NA,is of a private nature. That subsidy will be retro-,72
NA,spective to 28 March. That is provided for in the,72
NA,Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Grants) Bill. It is quite,72
NA,clear to anyone who knows what happens in the,72
NA,country areas of Australia that the many gas pro-,72
NA,ducing companies which supplied the reticulated,72
NA,system that applies in Victoria and elsewhere,72
NA,cannot take the sort of rapid rise that we saw take,72
NA,place between December and January last. Ordi-,72
NA,nary households and non-profit organisations-,72
NA,"hospitals, schools and others-wil l in effect pay",72
NA,$ 125 a tonne for LPG. Those industrial concerns,72
NA,and those who own motor vehicles which use,72
NA,LPG will pay $205 a tonne and the petrochemi-,72
NA,cal industry will pay a negotiatedfigurebased on,72
NA,the world parity export price of LPG. That is the,72
NA,three tier structure. It has been brought forward,72
NA,"for several reasons. Firstly, as I have said, the",72
NA,"commercialfirms,households and non-profit or-",72
NA,ganisations need time to adjust. In this debate we,72
NA,have heard many criticisms of this Government's,72
NA,making a reduction in price in spite of the,72
NA,scarcity of liquid fuel. What the persons making,72
NA,those criticisms failed to say was that an enor-,72
NA,mous price rise- a larger one-too k place in,72
NA,January of this year. The matter must be looked,72
NA,at in terms of the price in December last. I repeat,72
NA,that it rose from $147 a tonne to $252 a tonne.,72
NA,We have now reduced the price to commercial,72
NA,firms to $205 a tonne and ordinary household,72
NA,"consumers, hospitals and the like will pay even",72
NA,less than that. They will pay $125 a tonne-tha t,72
NA,"is to say, $80 a tonne less. I would have thought",72
NA,that that was a rational policy. It is a policy which,72
NA,envisages that there is a limit to therisethat can,72
NA,be stood by consumers in ordinary households,72
NA,and in commercial enterprises. Even if the world,72
NA,price rises very rapidly we cannot follow just as,72
NA,"rapidly with hugerises.After all, we are still left",72
NA,with commercial enterprises being faced with a,72
NA,rise in price from $147 a tonne to $205 a tonne.,72
NA,So this package has been put in place.,72
NA,The honourable member for Blaxland ( Mr,72
NA,Keating) made a speech last week. I was greatly,72
NA,intrigued by it. I was sitting at the table at the,72
NA,time. He was speaking in a debate on another,72
NA,Bill but his remarks concerned the same matter.,72
NA,He made some interesting comments to which I,72
NA,wish to refer briefly. He said:,72
NA,What the Government has done now is to change com-,72
NA,pletely the basis of its policy. There were two matters in ques-,72
NA,tion. The first relates to the narrowing gap between the price,72
NA,nf petrol and LPG. That gap . . . is about 13c-,72
NA,So he continued. He went on to say:,73
NA,. . . the true import parity price for oil which we all,73
NA,know is about $30 a barrel. But at the moment we are,73
NA,ing our refineries $24.77 a barrel.,73
NA,He is recorded on the next page of Hansard-,73
NA,page 1895-a s having said:,73
NA,There was a need for the Government to change its policy,73
NA,in respect of those people in the country who were,73
NA,to a Liquefied petroleum gas supply.,73
NA,Later he said:,73
NA,But what the Government did then was to reduce com-,73
NA,pletely and dramatically the whole pricing structure,73
NA,Arbitrarily it picked on a price of $205 per tonne and,73
NA,"reduced the per tonne price of""butane from $252 to $205 and",73
NA,propane from $290 to $205.,73
NA,I make two points. I have just referred to the,73
NA,"one; namely, that this reduction is to take place",73
NA,few weeks after an enormous increase was,73
NA,introduced. What we are effecting is a relative,73
NA,duction to offset the enormous increase that has,73
NA,taken place so far.,73
Dr KLUGMAN ,Th e Government's typical to,73
NA,yo-yo policy.,73
Mr GARLAND,"Well , of course, the world",73
NA,price is a yo-yo. That is the way of the world,73
NA,"which we live. The second point, which I think is",73
NA,"very important to us, is that the whole tenor of",73
NA,the honourable member's remarks was that,73
NA,Government's prices were not high enough.,73
Mr KEATING ,No .,73
Mr GARLAND,"Yes, it was. The honourable dance",73
NA,member said that the real price of oil was $30 a,73
NA,barrel and that we were charging only $24.77,73
NA,barrel. He said that with LPG-,73
Mr KEATING ," Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise",73
NA,point of order. I have just been misrepresented.,73
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr GILES) -This is LPG,73
NA,not the time to make a personal explanation.,73
Mr GARLAND,Th e honourable member is,73
NA,always doing that. The arguments are there.,73
NA,"relation to LPG, he referred in this speech- I",73
NA,have not quoted this section of it-t o opportunity,73
NA,costs. We know about that economic argument.,73
NA,What he was saying was that we have lost an,73
NA,portunity cost and that the only logical extension,73
NA,of that could be that the price was not high,73
NA,enough. I was explaining earlier why the,73
NA,Government has not raised the price more fully.,73
NA,It has not done so because we need time to adjust,73
NA,to the situation. That is why this whole policy has badly.,73
NA,been put in place. There are a number features in,73
NA,it to which I draw attention. Certain tax incen-,73
NA,tives have been provided in order to encourage,73
NA,people to stop using LPG and to start using elec-,73
NA,"tricity, mainly that generated by coal, which",73
NA,"have in abundance, or by the hydro-electric",73
NA,"scheme. Certainly, we would like to see some",73
NA,motor vehicles consuming LPG rather than pet-,73
NA,charg- rol. In ideal conditions we could have up to 10,73
NA,per cent or 15 per cent of our motor vehicles,73
NA,burning LPG. That would certainly effect a,73
NA,saving in motor spirit. Those people who wish to,73
NA,convert to LPG- I would imagine that they,73
NA,hooked up would be mainly fleet owners-wil l be,73
NA,"encouraged to do so because, under this policy,",73
NA,they will be able to buy their LPG more cheaply,73
NA,at $205 a tonne than they would pay if LPG were,73
NA,of LPG. sold at the world price which is approximately,73
NA,$252 a tonne at present.,73
NA,The Government has achieved a gap between,73
NA,the price of LPG and the price of petrol. That,73
NA,first gap means that if one does a reasonable,73
NA,a mileage- I refer mainly to fleet owners-ther e,73
NA,"will be a saving. As I understand it, vehicles",73
NA,remanufactured for the use of LPG and not need-,73
NA,ing conversion will be manufactured in Australia,73
NA,next year. That will allow more and more people,73
NA,use LPG and stop the use of oil in this country.,73
NA,Part of the policy will be to provide taxation de-,73
NA,ductions to discourage people from using oil and,73
NA,in LPG and encourage them to use electricity and,73
NA,other fuels. That is the objective of these Bills.,73
NA,Part of the objective is to cushion the effect and,73
NA,the part is to give the Government time.,73
NA,This country cannot wait any longer to convert,73
NA,into energies which we know we have in abun-,73
NA,and out of those which we know are,73
NA,"scarce. In the case of LPG, that energy source",73
NA,a will be scarce in the future. At this moment we,73
NA,are exporting most of our LPG. That is not going,73
NA,to last for more than a few years. We will be con-,73
NA,a suming all our production from the Bass Strait,73
NA,fields and before very long will be consuming the,73
NA,"from other fields as well. Of course, it is also",73
NA,basic to the parity pricing policy that we provide,73
NA,a price that encourages exploration. I tried to,73
NA,understand the reasoning of a gentleman op-,73
NA,In posite who earlier seemed to be indicating that,73
NA,that was not having an effect. I ask him to look at,73
NA,"the drilling and exploration that is going on, not",73
NA,"in the development of existing fields, but in ex-",73
NA,opplorations for new oil throughout the country. I,73
NA,ask him to talk to those who are engaged in these,73
NA,explorations and he will find that there is a big,73
NA,exploration program going on in this country. I,73
NA,for one am very optimistic that oil will be found.,73
NA,Certainly the economy and this country need it,73
NA,The first Bill which we are debating in this cog-,73
NA,"nate debate, the Liquefied Petroleum Gas",73
NA,"(Grants) Bill, provides for a subsidy of $80 a",73
NA,"we tonne for household users, schools and hospitals",73
NA,mainly in country areas so that these areas can,73
NA,adjust to this rapid rise in the price of LPG in,74
NA,"country regions. The second Bill, the Excise",74
NA,"Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3), provides for",74
NA,increased government excise so that the national,74
NA,economy can get some return from this windfall,74
NA,rise which oil companies have had in price. We,74
NA,believe that the national interest demands that,74
NA,"we get some share of this windfall for revenue,",74
NA,for expenditure purposes and for the reduction of,74
NA,the deficit.,74
NA,"I would like to say, in conclusion, that the",74
NA,Labor Party would really like to make this issue,74
NA,"an election issue. God knows, it needs some",74
NA,issues to help it along its way. The fact of the,74
NA,matter is that the Labor Party has no,74
NA,alternative policy. It does not promise any re-,74
NA,duction in the price of oil or LPG; it promises no,74
NA,reduction at all. I say to the honourable member,74
NA,for Blaxland that what it does,74
NA,cleverly. I invite him to read the speech which he,74
NA,made last week and to look at the logic of it. I listime.,74
NA,"tened to it with interest, but it is even more",74
NA,interesting to read. The Labor Party is looking,74
NA,for something because it knows-th e honourable,74
NA,member for Grey referred to this-tha t people,74
NA,are naturally unhappy about the rise in petrol,74
NA,and LPG prices. Nobody likes paying more for,74
NA,things. But more and more Australians,74
NA,stand the need for these policies. They do not,74
NA,"want to pay more, but they know the resource is",74
NA,scarce. They know it will never be cheap or plen-,74
NA,tiful again. They know we must try to do some-,74
NA,thing. These people know oil is scarce. They,74
NA,know we have to look for it in this country. They,74
NA,know LPG will be scarce. They know we should,74
NA,have policies. The Government does have these,74
NA,policies to try to encourage a greater use of coal,74
NA,and electricity. I am sure Australians are sensible,74
NA,about this. That is why they will not accept the,74
NA,Labor Party's non-policy.,74
Mr KEATING ,Blaxland)-I wish to make a,74
NA,personal explanation.,74
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr GILES) -Does,74
NA,the honourable member claim to have been,74
NA,misrepresented?,74
Mr KEATING,Yes . The Minister for Busi-,74
NA,ness and Consumer Affairs ( Mr Garland) tried to,74
NA,claim that in a speech I made last week in this,74
NA,House I had tried to put an argument for higher,74
NA,prices. This is not true. What I was arguing was,74
NA,that the gap between petrol and liquefied pet-,74
NA,roleum gas had shrunk because LPG had been,74
NA,priced at the world price but the Government,74
NA,was not pricing oil at the world price and there-,74
NA,"fore, the gap was closing. If the Government had",74
NA,stuck with its own policy of pricing oil at the,74
NA,"world price through refineries, the gap between",74
NA,LPG and petrol would widen again. That was,74
NA,the point that I made.,74
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Is that the point of,74
NA,your misrepresentation?,74
Mr KEATING, I would like to say just one,74
NA,more sentence. The Government is preaching the,74
NA,virtue of opportunity costs. All I was saying was:,74
NA,'Let it stick to its own policy'. We do not support,74
NA,that policy.,74

NA,That the bill be now read a second time.,75
Mr JOHN MCLEAY ,Boothby-Minister for,75
NA,"Administrative Services)- Mr Speaker, may I",75
NA,have your indulgence to suggest that the House,75

NA,Australian Federal Police (Consequential,75
NA,Amendments) Bill 1980 as they are associated,75
NA,"measures. Separate questions will, of course, be",75
NA,put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the,75
NA,debate.,75
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr GILES) -Is it the,75
NA,wish of the House to have a general debate,75
NA,covering these two measures? There being no,75
NA,"objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",75
Dr KLUGMAN ,Prospect) (10.7)-We are,75
NA,debating two Bills tonight. The more important,75
NA,is the Australian Federal Police Amendment Bill.,75
NA,I will explain very quickly to the House the,75
NA,reason for this legislation. The Australian Fed-,75
NA,Thomson. D. S.,75
NA,eral Police Act 1979 established the Australian,75
NA,Federal Police Force which was basically a com-,75
NA,bination of the former Australian Capital Terri-,75
NA,tory Police Force and the Commonwealth Police,75
NA,NOES Force. The Act gave to members of those two,75
NA,forces legal preferences for any appointment to,75
NA,Jones. Barry,75
NA,Jones. Charles,75
NA,the ranks in the Australian Federal Police Force,75
NA,ahead of any person joining from outside the,75
NA,Kerin. J.C.,75
NA,"Klugman, R. E.",75
NA,"Federal Police Force, particularly to the com-",75
NA,ponent of the Force which was performing gen-,75
NA,eral police functions. It is important to realise,75
NA,that basically the Federal Police Force consists,75
NA,of two components: A general duty component,75
NA,Wallis. L. G.,75
NA,West. S.J.,75
NA,and a protective services component.,75
NA,After the establishment of the Australian Fed-,75
NA,"eral Police Force last year, on 6 November 1979",75
NA,the Deputy Prime Minister ( Mr Anthony) an-,75
NA,nounced that the Government had adopted a,75
NA,recommendation of the interim report of the,75
NA,"Innes, V. E. Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into",75
NA,Cameron. Clyde,75
NA,Drugs. That recommendation was to disband the,75
NA,Federal Narcotics Bureau and to transfer the,75
NA,functions of the Bureau to the Australian Federal,75
NA,Police. The Government also announced that it,75
NA,would transfer those members of the Narcotics,75
NA,Bureau whom the Commissioner of the Aus-,75
NA,Third Reading tralian Federal Police considered to be suitable,75
NA,and qualified for appointment as police officers,75
NA,to the Australian Federal Police Force. That is,75
NA,the background of what happened. To appoint,75
NA,"those people to the Federal Police Force, it is",75
NA,necessary to amend legal preferences which were,75
NA,established in the original Australian Federal,75
NA,Police Act.,75
NA,Second Reading The Opposition opposes this legislation and I,75
NA,now formally move:,75
NA,That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to sub-,75
NA,stituting the following words:,75
NA,'as the present arrangements for the policing of major,75
NA,drug trafficking legislation are unsatisfactory and,75
NA,proposed arrangements for the transfer to the Australian,75
NA,Federal Police of former officers ofthe Narcotics Bureau,75
NA,"will produce anomalies and unfairness, the bill be with-",75
NA,drawn and re-drafted to provide for:,75
NA,(1) the creation of a further major component of the Aus-,75
NA,tralian Federal Police to be responsible for the,75
NA,policing of Federal and State drug trafficking legis-,75
NA,"lation, such component to be accountable to the Aus-",75
NA,"tralian Federal Police Commissioner, and through",75
NA,him to the Minister and the Parliament;,75
NA,"(2) the proposed component to comprise A.F.P. officers,",75
NA,together with a significant number of experienced,75
NA,"officers seconded from State Police Forces, such State",75
NA,officers to continue to operate as far as possible in,75
NA,"their home States, and not to be prejudiced in their",75
NA,"career advancement by accepting such secondment,",75
NA,and,75
NA,(3) an arrangement whereby former members of the,75
NA,Narcotics Bureau who seek transfer to the Australian,75
NA,"Federal Police, and who are considered qualified in",76
NA,"this respect by the Commissioner, may be appointed",76
NA,as officers or non-commissioned officers of the,76
NA,proposed new narcotics component'.,76
NA,There are a number of reasons for my moving,76
NA,that amendment. The first is that it seems unfair,76
NA,to us that within six months of establishing,76
NA,preference for the members of the Australian,76
NA,"Federal Police, that legal preference is considerwill",76
NA,ably watered down by the movement of 84 or 86,76
NA,officers into the Australian Federal Police Force,76
NA,at different levels. The only evidence I have,76
NA,the levels at which they will be moved in is,76
NA,article in the Canberra Times of 4 April 1980.,76
NA,The article refers to 86 former Bureau members.,76
NA,It states:,76
NA,It is expected that 86 former bureau agents will be offered,76
NA,"ranks in the force; 36 at constable level, 42 at sergeant and",76
NA,seven at inspector level. One former agent is expected,76
NA,given the rank of superintendent or chief superintendent.,76
NA,The proposal is that people who have previously,76
NA,been employed in the Federal Narcotics Bureau,76
NA,will be moved sideways-o r laterally-int o the,76
NA,Federal Police Force on the basis of their salary.,76
NA,"In other words, a public servant of a particular",76
NA,"grade receiving, for example, about $18,000",76
NA,"nually, the salary of an inspector in the Federal",76
NA,"Police Force, would be transferred into the Fedinvestigation",76
NA,eral Police Force at inspector level. I think all,76
NA,us would agree that whilst that person,76
NA,qualified to be an inspector and to hold the pos-,76
NA,ition of inspector in regard to narcotics investiby They,76
NA,"gations, he does not necessarily have the training",76
NA,"to be a general inspector in the Australian Fedpresent,",76
NA,eral Police. One can easily understand the were,76
NA,"complaint-an d I would hope, agree with it-b y cotics",76
NA,present members of the Australian Federal trafficking.,76
NA,Pohce that people from an outside bureau are,76
NA,being admitted laterally to the general duties,76
NA,component of the Australian Federal Police,76
NA,Force at a level for which they are not necessarly,76
NA,"qualified. At present, a person serving in the",76
NA,tective services component of the Australian,76
NA,"Federal Police Force can cross over to the genviously,",76
NA,"eral duties section only by way of examination,",76
NA,even though he may have had training in a State,76
NA,police force. But this examination will not,76
NA,necessary for people from the Narcotics Bureau.,76
NA,As I understand it from members of the AusHall,76
NA,"tralian Federal Police, they would like what",76
NA,called a brevet rank for such people who will,76
NA,engaged in narcotics work.,76
NA,I will be interested to hear the arguments,76
NA,the Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr,76
NA,John MCLeay) or other Government members,76
NA,against establishing a third component for the,76
NA,Federal Police. One of the significant arguments,76
NA,-an d I think it would be silly to ignore it,76
NA,we are debating this legislation tonight-relate s,76
NA,to the qualifications that people of the old Nar-,76
NA,"cotics Bureau have. After all, the Federal Nar-",76
NA,cotics Bureau was not dissolved because it had,76
NA,done a fantastic job; it was dissolved because it,76
NA,"was found to be inefficient and incompetent and,",76
NA,"legal according to some people, because some",76
NA,members were corrupt. Honourable members,76
NA,recall that it was disbanded very quickly fol-,76
NA,lowing the interim report by Mr Justice Williams.,76
NA,That report made a number of allegations about,76
NA,as to members of the Narcotics Bureau which cer-,76
NA,an tainly suggest that some of them are not appro-,76
NA,priate people to become senior members of a,76
NA,general Federal police force in Australia.,76
NA,I think it is appropriate-o r may be it is,76
NA,inappropriate-tha t tonight on the news one of,76
NA,to be the major items was a report of a coroner's in-,76
NA,quest in Victoria into the death of two people. I f i,76
NA,"remember correctly, it was into the deaths of Mr",76
NA,and Mrs Wilson. It is important to remember,76
NA,what the former Minister for Business and Con-,76
NA,"sumer Affairs, the present Minister for Education",76
NA,( Mr Fife) had to say about the deaths of Mr and,76
NA,an Mrs Wilson. As reported at page 2905 of the,76
NA,"Hansard of 5 June 1979, when talking about the",76
NA,that was to take place into the alle-,76
NA,"of gations by the two persons since deceased, a Mr",76
NA,"may be and Mrs Wilson, the Minister said:",76
NA,alleged that informadon contained on tapes made,76
NA,the Queensland police was made available to the Nar-,76
NA,cotics Bureau. A member of the Narcotics Bureau was,76
NA,"as I understand it, during the time that the Wilsons",76
NA,being interrogated. During that interview allegations,76
NA,were made that informadon was being leaked from the Nar-,76
NA,Bureau to people outside who were engaged in drug,76
NA,"The allegations, made last year in at least two",76
NA,newspapers-th e Sun-News-Pictorial and the,76
NA,Sydney Daily Telegraph-wer e that the killing of,76
NA,pro Mr and Mrs Wilson was a result of those alle-,76
NA,gations made against the Narcotics Bureau. Ob-,76
NA,I am unable to comment on the accuracy,76
NA,of those allegations but the Government cer-,76
NA,tainly considered them important enough and to,76
NA,be be of sufficient significance that a combined,76
NA,police task force under Assistant Commissioner,76
NA,of the Victoria Police was appointed to in-,76
NA,is vestigate allegations of criminal behaviour by,76
NA,be members of the Federal Narcotics Bureau which,76
NA,led to the killing of Mr and Mrs Wilson. I am not,76
NA,aware whether the task force has reported. If it,76
NA,"of has, to the best of my knowledge no statement",76
NA,has been made to this Parliament on whether,76
NA,any action has resulted from it.,76
NA,Surely we must all be disturbed-t o put it,76
NA,when mildly-tha t some people belonging to the old,76
NA,"Narcotics Bureau, against which very grave",77
NA,"gations were made, are now being given said in part:",77
NA,preference in the Australian Federal Police. I ob-,77
NA,viously do not know which people in the old cotics,77
NA,"Narcotics Bureau, if any, were guilty of failures some",77
NA,or criminal behaviour. It is interesting to note COMPOL-,77
NA,"what the Deputy Prime Minister ( Mr Anthony),",77
NA,said on 6 November in announcing the decision especially,77
NA,to disband the Bureau. Mr Anthony said:,77
NA,In July 1979 following allegations of leakages of infor-,77
NA,mation from an unknown officer of the Sydney office of the,77
NA,"Narcotics Bureau, the Government decided it was appropri-",77
NA,ate to consider general matters,77
NA,"reau, including organisation, recruitment, staffing and con-",77
NA,"trol, lines of responsibility to the Permanent Head and the",77
NA,"Minister, and relationship with other arms of government.",77
NA,"Accordingly, on 7 August, with the approval of His Excel-",77
NA,"lency the Governor-General, the Prime Minister ( Mr Mal-",77
NA,colm Fraser) sought from the Australian Royal Commission,77
NA,of Inquiry into Drugs an interim repon on those issues. The,77
NA,interim report was presented to the Governor-General on 18,77
NA,September 1979.,77
NA,On the same day an amended version of the,77
NA,terim report was presented to the House because,77
NA,the Royal Commissioner did not want the full,77
NA,port to be publicised. It was recommended that,77
NA,the Narcotics Bureau be disbanded and the,77
NA,Government decided to follow that course. The,77
NA,Deputy Prime Minister said:,77
NA,The Government has therefore decided not to accept,77
NA,Royal Commission's recommendation that,77
NA,cotics Bureau be given the option,77
NA,tralian Federal Police or remaining with the Bureau of Cus-,77
NA,"toms. Instead, the Government has decided to follow the",77
NA,normal procedures for transfers of functions within the,77
NA,Government's service.,77
NA,It is important to emphasise that the Deputy,77
NA,"Prime Minister said, as reported at page 2614 of",77
NA,Hansard:,77
NA,The Royal Commission has come to the considered,77
NA,opinion that the Narcotics Bureau is not a highly efficient,77
NA,agency; that there is considerable and increasing distrust of,77
NA,the Narcotics Bureau among other law enforcement agen-,77
NA,"cies; and that within the judicial system, generally",77
NA,the Narcotics Bureau's reputation,77
NA,that of State police forces.,77
NA,That represents an extremely damning statement,77
NA,by a Royal Commissioner concerning a Govern-,77
NA,ment department. Yet we see now that former,77
NA,members of the Narcotics Bureau are to be given,77
NA,general police duties-som e at a quite high,77
NA,level-i n an established Australian Federal,77
NA,Police force. At page 2615 of Hansard we are,77
NA,reminded of the essential features ofthe report of,77
NA,Mr Justice Williams. The Hansard record reads:,77
NA,He condemns the Bureau of Narcotics for being amateur-,77
NA,"ish, for being incompetent, for effectively being dishonest,",77
NA,and for being obsessive about its own reputation instead of,77
NA,getting out and getting done the job it was charged to dis-,77
NA,charge. He suggested that perhaps it was corrupted on a,77
NA,significant scale.,77
NA,alleThe interim report of the Royal Commissioner,77
NA,There is considerable and increasing distrust of the Nar-,77
NA,Bureau among other law enforcement bodies. For,77
NA,years relationships between the Narcotics Bureau and,77
NA,"That is, of course, the Commonwealth Police-",77
NA,"at the top levels, have been bad, but now relation-",77
NA,ships between the Narcotics Bureau and State police are bad,77
NA,in many places.,77
NA,So Mr Justice Williams found that relationships,77
NA,were bad. Members of the law enforcement,77
NA,relating to the Narcotics Bu-,77
NA,"agencies did not trust the Bureau, yet now we are",77
NA,to move these gentlemen from the Bureau across,77
NA,"into the Australian Federal Police force, which is",77
NA,"made up in part of COMPOL, the old Common-",77
NA,wealth Police force.,77
NA,The report was highly critical of Mr Harvey,77
NA,Bates. We all recall when Mr Harvey Bates first,77
NA,resigned from the leadership of the Narcotics,77
NA,inBureau and then was asked by the Minister for,77
NA,Business and Consumer Affairs ( Mr Fife) to re-,77
NA,reconsider his resignation. Honourable members,77
NA,will recall that Mr Bates then withdrew it and,77
NA,that everyone on the Government side was ter-,77
NA,ribly pleased that Mr Bates had done so. Within,77
NA,a very few weeks the whole situation exploded in,77
NA,"the the Government's face. Amongst other things,",77
NA,staff of the Nar Mr Justice Williams said:,77
NA,of transferring to the Aus-,77
NA,The Narcotics Bureau is not a highly efficient enforcement,77
NA,agency.,77
NA,"Increases in arrests, prosecutions and seizures of drugs",77
NA,have often occurred with little or no Narcotics Bureau,77
NA,assistance.,77
NA,Some of the largest seizures in recent years attributed in,77
NA,the media to the Narcotics Bureau have in fact occurred,77
NA,without any real assistance from the Narcotics Bureau.,77
NA,The Royal Commissioner also criticised the,77
NA,"training of officers of the Bureau, a matter that is",77
NA,surely relevant if such people are to be trans-,77
NA,"speaking, ferred at a high level to the Australian Federal",77
NA,for efficiency is lower than,77
NA,Police force. He said also that the training of,77
NA,Narcotics Bureau officers leaves much to be,77
NA,desired. I repeat that the Royal Commissioner,77
NA,said that the training of Narcotics Bureau officers,77
NA,leaves much to be desired. Articles in the Bulletin,77
NA,in August and September of last year state that,77
NA,ex-Federal Narcotics Bureau officers referred to,77
NA,illegal phone tapping by the Bureau. Taken at its,77
NA,"very lowest, the criticism of the whole set-up of",77
NA,the Bureau must surely leave us in some doubt as,77
NA,to whether a significant proportion of the officers,77
NA,of the Bureau are proper and fit persons to be-,77
NA,come very senior officers in the Australian Fed-,77
NA,"eral Police force, as is proposed under this legis-",77
NA,"lation. My own view, and that of the Opposition",77
NA,"generally, is that the Bill ought to be withdrawn;",77
NA,that the method of policing drug traffic legis-,78
NA,lation is at present unsatisfactory and that the,78
NA,proposed arrangements for the transference to,78
NA,the Australian Federal Police force of former,78
NA,"officers of the Narcotics Bureau is unfair, unsatisagree",78
NA,factory and will not help the investigation of,78
NA,drug trafficking.,78
NA,The Opposition believes that a special com-,78
NA,ponent should be established in the Australian,78
NA,Federal Police force to deal with drug trafficking.,78
NA,That seems to me to be a reasonable proposition,78
NA,and I hope that if the Minister will not accept our,78
NA,amendment he will give us some worthwhile,78
NA,reasons for not doing so. It is important to draw,78
NA,to his attention the fact that officers of the Aus-,78
NA,"tralian Federal Police force who, of course, are",78
NA,"under his basic control, are not happy about",78
NA,what has been proposed. They feel cheated in,78
NA,"some ways and discriminated against, having",78
NA,negotiated five-year preferential treatment,78
NA,under the original Act and that Act being,78
NA,amended within a few months of the force's,78
NA,being established. Drug trafficking is likely to be,78
NA,with us for a considerable period. It is a major,78
NA,problem not only in this country but also in most,78
NA,others.,78
NA,"I would like to recount quickly, because I",78
NA,"sider it a relatively funny story, what happened",78
NA,to me when I was in East Berlin about 18 months,78
NA,ago. While attending a conference of the Interlation,78
NA,parliamentary Union in Bonn I went across,78
NA,East Berlin for two or three days. I met a number,78
NA,"of medical practitioners there. Obviously, I",78
NA,not want to mention by name the person conagain,78
NA,"cerned, but one senior medical officer was a",78
NA,member of the East German Communist Party.,78
NA,He was very proud of his country but was not,78
NA,"carried away by his country's success, when comthat,",78
NA,pared with that of West Germany or of such,78
NA,countries as Australia.,78
NA,Debate interrupted.,78
NA,ADJOURNMENT,78
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr M i l l a r ) -,78
NA,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the temptation",78
NA,question:,78
NA,That the House do now adjourn.,78
NA,"Mr John MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, I re-",78
NA,quire that the question be put forthwith without,78
NA,debate.,78
NA,Question resolved in the negative.,78
NA,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE,78
NA,AMENDMENT BILL 1980,78
NA,Second Reading,78
NA,Debate resumed.,78
Dr KLUGMAN ,Prospect) (10.31)-This,78
NA,chap was telling me about what was going on in,78
NA,East German medicine. He was emphasising its,78
NA,inferiority. I think honourable members will,78
NA,that I am not a great supporter of the sort,78
NA,of regime that exists in the German Democratic,78
NA,"Republic, but I started to feel sorry for him. I",78
NA,said: 'You will probably have less of a problem,78
NA,with car accidents because you have fewer cars'.,78
NA,He said: 'People get drunk and go faster because,78
NA,there are fewer cars on the road. So we finish up,78
NA,with just as many accidents'. So I tried some-,78
NA,thing else. I said to him: 'What about the drug,78
NA,problem? I suppose that you have fewer prob-,78
NA,lems with drugs'. He said: 'That is true. Many of,78
NA,us believe that this is due to the new socio-,78
NA,"economic conditions in this country, but others",78
NA,have suggested that it is due to the fact that the,78
NA,traffickers will not accept our currency'. I think,78
NA,that is undoubtedly the reason that East Ger-,78
NA,many has less of a drug problem than many,78
NA,other countries. When one goes to a money,78
NA,exchange in West Berlin one can get 4.3 East,78
NA,German marks for every West German mark.,78
NA,The point I am emphasising is that the drug,78
NA,problem will continue for as long as there is,78
NA,conmoney in it. There will be people prepared to,78
NA,take very highrisksto make huge profits. I have,78
NA,"previously made the point in this House, in re-",78
NA,"to what we are talking about tonight, that",78
NA,to in my view some of the propaganda and pub-,78
NA,licity associated with the arrests of drug,78
NA,do traffickers are counterproductive. Again and,78
NA,when news of such arrests is released to the,78
NA,"media it is emphasised that $lm, $2m or similar",78
NA,huge amounts is involved. My view is that those,78
NA,figures are probably exaggerated in any case and,78
NA,"even if they are not, it would be better i f",78
NA,they were not emphasised. If people continue to,78
NA,be told that such huge amounts can be made out,78
NA,"of drug trafficking, and if those amounts are",78
NA,often exaggerated because it gives the police,78
NA,officers some satisfaction to be able to say that,78
NA,they have caught somebody with $lm worth of,78
NA,"heroin, or whatever it may be, there will be a",78
NA,for people to take the risks associated,78
NA,with drug trafficking because they can see huge,78
NA,profits in it.,78
NA,Many of these people are very young. The,78
NA,word 'innocent' is probably the wrong one to use,78
NA,"to describe them, but they start off innocent when",78
NA,they are travellers. Let us point out to these,78
NA,people the risks involved. Let us point out to,78
NA,them that they can finish up in gaol in Australia,78
NA,or in other countries where it is even less pleasant,78
NA,to be in gaol. Let us point out to them that the,78
NA,actual profit to them will be very much less than,78
NA,"the millions of dollars which are talked about,",79
NA,that they will get relatively little out of it and that,79
NA,"they take a tremendous risk, quite apart from the",79
NA,morality of making any sort of money out of,79
NA,spreading drug addiction in this country. This is,79
NA,my appeal to the Government. I hope that the,79
NA,Minister in his reply will point out to me why this,79
NA,third component of the Australian Federal,79
NA,Police Force should not be established and why,79
NA,it should not be possible to move suitable people,79
NA,from the Narcotics Bureau into that special com-,79
NA,ponent of the Federal Police Force.,79
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Is the amendment,79
NA,seconded?,79
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,Kingsford-Smith),79
NA,(10.34)- I second the amendment. I know that,79
NA,time is short and that there is to be another,79
NA,"speaker in this debate, but I want to make a point",79
NA,because debate on this subject has been going on,79
NA,for some time now. Last year the then Minister,79
NA,for Business and Consumer Affairs introduced,79
NA,legislation to give powers to what was then,79
NA,called the Australian Narcotics Bureau. At the,79
NA,time he introduced that Bill he said that it was,79
NA,"necessary to face the drug menace head on,",79
NA,armed with a law enforcement capacity equal to,79
NA,the threat that was posed. I make the point that,79
NA,that was last year and that that Bill went through,79
NA,the Senate on or about 28 August. It gave great,79
NA,powers to the Narcotics Bureau. We said that the,79
NA,legislation was dangerous. We suggested that,79
NA,there be more safeguards.,79
NA,We can now say in retrospect that it was,79
NA,"honest legislation because, as you know Mr real",79
NA,"Deputy Speaker, the interim report of Mr Justice",79
NA,"Williams was handed down on 18 September,",79
NA,only a few days after the Bill went through,79
NA,Senate. That report recommended that the Narcome,79
NA,cotics Bureau be disbanded because it was action,79
NA,"inefficient and incompetent. In June of last year,",79
NA,"as has been said, the Government appointed a",79
NA,special police team to investigate the murders,79
NA,Douglas and Isabel Wilson. The suggestion was,79
NA,that the Narcotics Bureau had,79
NA,a drug trafficking syndicate. We have not got that,79
NA,"report, as the honourable member for Prospect",79
NA,(Dr Klugman) said. There have been more than,79
NA,those two murders. If we look at what the,79
NA,Attorney-General (Senator Durack) said on,79
NA,"August last year, we will realise that it is",79
NA,belief to think that he was making such comwould,79
NA,ments. He made this point:,79
NA,Because of the encouragement that Ihe Government,79
NA,"given to the Narcotics Bureau, stronger methods have",79
NA,adopted to combat the situation and to improve the,79
NA,ties of detection. The Federal Bureau of Narcotics has been,79
NA,substantially upgraded.,79
NA,Within a matter of days Mr Justice Williams de-,79
NA,"scribed it as inefficient, poorly trained, low in",79
NA,"morale, indecisive and poorly led. Something",79
NA,has to be done about this. We do not believe this,79
NA,legislation is good enough from the point of view,79
NA,of the people of this country. Simply because of,79
NA,that background we have to look very closely at,79
NA,the information that has been fed to the Govern-,79
NA,ment. It has to be responsible enough to get the,79
NA,best possible people in this area. In answer to an,79
NA,amendment which was moved in the Senate the,79
NA,Attorney-General said:,79
NA,The Opposition has moved an amendment which would,79
NA,have the effect really of negating the Bill. It wants the Bill,79
NA,withdrawn until the current police inquiry into the Narcotics,79
NA,Bureau has been completed. That inquiry is not one into the,79
NA,Narcotics Bureau as such. It is a police inquiry into a com-,79
NA,plaint or an allegation that has been made against one,79
NA,unnamed member of the Narcotics Bureau . . . this in-,79
NA,quiry is not one into the Narcotics Bureau as a whole. It is,79
NA,nothing like that. It is an inquiry into allegations that have,79
NA,been made against one man in that Bureau.,79
NA,The other proposal put forward by the Opposition is that,79
NA,the Bill should not proceed until the Williams Royal Com-,79
NA,"mission has completed its inquiry. My colleague, the Minister",79
NA,for Business and Consumer Affairs in another place has,79
NA,"indicated that Mr Justice Williams, the Royal Commissioner,",79
NA,has been made aware ofthe Government's intentions lo pro-,79
NA,ceed with this legislation. He has not expressed any oppo-,79
NA,sition to that.,79
NA,How anyone could possibly suggest that at that,79
NA,stage Mr Justice Williams supported the Govern-,79
NA,"ment, is beyond belief. That is the sort of argu-",79
NA,ment that has been put up. If one wanted to look,79
NA,"at Mr Justice Williams's other report, which one",79
NA,"cannot do, one would see that this matter was not",79
NA,disrelated to one man in the Narcotics Bureau. The,79
NA,problem that we have in this country is that,79
NA,there appears to have been massive infiltration of,79
NA,the Narcotics Bureau. Allegations were made,79
NA,the that in every case when information seemed to,79
NA,to the notice of the Narcotics Bureau no,79
NA,took place or criminals were alerted to the,79
NA,fact that perhaps action was to be taken against,79
NA,them. It is incredible to think that we will now,79
NA,of say: 'Everything is all right. Only one or two,79
NA,people are involved. Everybody else is clean'.,79
NA,been infiltrated by That is not so.,79
NA,We want to look at the issues which Mr Justice,79
NA,Williams raised with the Government. We raised,79
NA,the question of warrants for telephone tapping,79
NA,28 and the Government rejected those amend-,79
NA,beyond ments. Honourable members can imagine what,79
NA,happen if people who do not have the in-,79
NA,tegrity they should have are able to use these,79
NA,sorts of devices to intrude into everybody else's,79
NA,has privacy. What sort of power are we unleashing in,79
NA,been this area? We make it clear that the Williams re-,79
NA,possibiliport was an indictment of the Government. It,79
NA,highlighted its ineptitude and its dishonesty.,79
NA,There are many disquieting feature: of this,80
NA,legislation. We are particularly concerned at the,80
NA,wholesale transfer of the Narcotics Bureau to the,80
NA,Australian Federal Police. We asked questions,80
NA,about this matter on 26 March and again today.,80
NA,The whole thrust of those questions was about,80
NA,the serious charges that have been levelled at the,80
NA,Bureau. They just cannot be swept aside. But we,80
NA,have not had responsible answers. These are ex-,80
NA,tremely serious matters. The two most serious,80
NA,"are, first, that the Bureau was infiltrated by drug",80
NA,"traffickers and, secondly, that it was generally",80
NA,"inept, inefficient and poorly trained. Williams",80
NA,says that in his report. He makes an important,80
NA,point talking about the special police report into,80
NA,the murders. We do not have it and he obviously,80
NA,did not have it. He said:,80
NA,It is unfortunate that the repon of the four police,80
NA,not available at the time of writing. The Commission be-,80
NA,lieves the police officers' report will have a general sig-,80
NA,nificance of greater imponance than that simply in relation,80
NA,to the Wilsons' allegations.,80
NA,"course, the security of systems of criminal intelligence",80
NA,against abuse and misuse by the persons entrusted with the,80
NA,information.,80
NA,We make the point that that report has not yet,80
NA,been made available to us. This is a most serious,80
NA,"matter. Yet, once again, we have been asked to",80
NA,pass this legislation. Infiltration of the Narcotics,80
NA,Bureau could perhaps involve only a handful of,80
NA,officers. But we would like to know that,80
NA,"all been cleared. However, the allegations of cor-",80
NA,ruption have been made by people who have electronic,80
NA,subsequently been murdered. One can underuse,80
NA,stand the concern of officers of the Australian,80
NA,Federal Police that they may be forced to work,80
NA,with Narcotics Bureau officers and give them inlating,80
NA,formation concerning both informants and,80
NA,officers in deep cover. If we looked at the centres,80
NA,Williams report-bu t we cannot do that-w e fight,80
NA,would see that that is a very serious matter,80
NA,concern and there is evidence to support that sort,80
NA,of concern.,80
NA,"Mr Lewis, the Queensland Police Com-",80
NA,"missioner, stated in Hobart at the National Con-",80
NA,ference of Australian Police Commissioners,80
NA,the Queensland police would not co-operate,80
NA,with the Australian Federal Police while the,80
NA,Narcotics Bureau officers remained. He regards',80
NA,them as the same people merely wearing criminal,80
NA,different hats. The Victorian Police also have,80
NA,made it clear that they have no time for the,80
NA,cotics Bureau. We have a situation where,80
NA,members of the Narcotics Bureau have been,80
NA,transferred en bloc in many cases with higher,80
NA,rights than long serving police officers. Such an,80
NA,action is simply not in accord with thefindingsof,80
NA,"Mr Justice Williams. The Government will, of",80
NA,"course, say: 'Oh, well, we have left it all to Sir",80
NA,Colin Woods'. But the actions must be seriously,80
NA,questioned as to whether they are now in the,80
NA,"long term interests of members or, even more im-",80
NA,"portantly, of law enforcement in relation to drug",80
NA,trafficking.,80
NA,Not only was there maladministration of the,80
NA,Narcotics Bureau by the Minister at the time;,80
NA,there were also many disquieting features of the,80
NA,Greek conspiracy case where there were ques-,80
NA,tions of telephone tapping and the use of listen-,80
NA,ing devices. It is not good enough for the Minis-,80
NA,ter to say that he does not want to involve,80
NA,himself in questions of law. He has to administer,80
NA,this matter. In our view the policing of major,80
NA,drug trafficking law is unnecessarily splintered,80
NA,and potentially dangerous. The report of Mr Jus-,80
NA,officers is tice Williams recommends a division of functions,80
NA,and powers between the Australian Federal,80
NA,Police and the State pohce forces. The over-,80
NA,whelming proportion of narcotics in Australia is,80
NA,"This general significance is, of",80
NA,imported. But we cannot accept that it is desir-,80
NA,able to have a multiplicity of police forces chas-,80
NA,ing imported drugs throughout Australia. We,80
NA,make the point that for a drug law enforcement,80
NA,agency we need the best possible people in,80
NA,Australia. This can only be done by the establish-,80
NA,ment of a single agency drawn from the best,80
NA,"available police officers operating at a federal,",80
NA,they had State and territorial level.,80
NA,"The powers in relation to telephone tapping,",80
NA,"surveillance, mail interception and the",80
NA,of taxation records are not powers which can,80
NA,be given to an ordinary law enforcement agency.,80
NA,The recommendations in the Williams report re-,80
NA,to the National Criminal Drug Intelligence,80
NA,Centre and State criminal drug intelligence,80
NA,are to be welcomed. It is essential in the,80
NA,against drug trafficking that all information,80
NA,of and intelligence should as far as possible be,80
NA,located in particular units. The co-operation be-,80
NA,tween the national centre and the State centres is,80
NA,also welcomed.,80
NA,In its 1975 report on criminal investigation the,80
NA,that Law Reform Commission pointed out some,80
NA,"problems. Firstly, the circumstances in which",80
NA,police may disseminate data ought to be strictly,80
NA,controlled. There must be provision to expunge,80
NA,records after an appropriate time lapse,80
NA,and there must be some mechanism by which in-,80
NA,Nardividuals can have intelligence data concerning,80
NA,themselves corrected. Any police force that is,80
NA,dealing in law enforcement in the area of drug,80
NA,trafficking will be open to suggestions of corrup-,80
NA,tion. It is important that the public is assured that,80
NA,all complaints against the police are properly,80
NA,investigated. The Government has two reports of,80
NA,the Law Reform Commission dealing with com-,81
NA,plaints against the police. We are continually,81
NA,"promised action, but nothing eventuates. Any",81
NA,complaints against the police procedure must be,81
NA,based on reports of the Law Reform Com-,81
NA,"mission, that is, not only should there be investidrug",81
NA,gation by an internal unit but also must there be,81
NA,an independent element of oversight by the,81
NA,Ombudsman and access to an independent,81
NA,tribunal.,81
NA,Let me refer to some of the powers that are,81
NA,recommended for police forces or already apply,81
NA,"under existing legislation. Firstly, we make the",81
NA,point that only a nauonal narcotics drug unit,81
NA,should be given extraordinary powers. These,81
NA,powers should not be exercised by State police,81
NA,"forces. As far as telephone tapping is concerned,",81
NA,we are to some extent satisfied with the existing,81
NA,provisions on the basis that it is only on judicial,81
NA,"warrant. However, we would like to see further",81
NA,safeguards which we have spelt out in previous,81
NA,debates. The provisions relating to other forms of,81
NA,electronic surveillance recommended in the,81
NA,Williams report are quite deficient and in fact,81
NA,provide less safeguards than already exist in the,81
NA,Customs Act. In other words the police can give,81
NA,the authority. That is not good enough. We want,81
NA,judicial warrants.,81
NA,The Opposition particularly welcomes the,81
NA,ommendations in the report relating to the use,81
NA,"income tax records. As a method of detection,",81
NA,"these records are far more important than telereport,",81
NA,phone tapping and such devices. They also affect,81
NA,the privacy of far fewer people than do,81
NA,phone taps in particular and other forms of elecsubstantially,81
NA,tronic surveillance. Financial return is what,81
NA,tivates criminals. The use under very strict,81
NA,supervision of the financial returns of people,81
NA,who may be drug traffickers will be most valuthe,81
NA,able information. We are quite satisfied that,81
NA,there will be no revenue lost through this,81
NA,ation to section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment,81
NA,"Act. This measure was, in fact, proposed by the",81
NA,Opposition as far back as 1977.,81
NA,We must look at the question how,81
NA,after people and also attack criminals. We must,81
NA,draw a distinction between users and traffickers.,81
NA,Users need help. They are sick and they,81
NA,social problems. But these problems will not,81
NA,solved by incarceration. Our amendment part,81
NA,amounts to opposition because the legislation,81
NA,unfair not only because it creates anomalies,81
NA,tween members of the Australian Federal Police,81
NA,and former members of the Narcotics Bureau,81
NA,but also because itfliesin the face of the major,81
NA,recommendations of the Williams report. The,81
NA,old Narcotics Bureau has just been given a new,81
NA,name. The tensions which existed between the,81
NA,Bureau and the Austrahan Federal Police as well,81
NA,as the State police will continue. We want to see,81
NA,the Australian Federal Police as a first class,81
NA,pohce force and the National Drug Unit as a,81
NA,law enforcement body equal to any in the,81
NA,world. It is for that reason that I support the,81
NA,amendment.,81
Mr NEIL ,St George) (10.49)-The manage-,81
NA,ment of the business of the House has broken,81
NA,down. There is hardly any time at all for full de-,81
NA,bate on this important Bill. That is a most regret-,81
NA,table state of affairs. In the extremely short time,81
NA,"available, all I am able to do is to outline one or",81
NA,"two important points. First, I strongly support",81
NA,the legislation which arises out ofthe recommen-,81
NA,dations of a royal commission. I am very sur-,81
NA,prised that the Opposition has declared that it,81
NA,opposes this legislation. The opposition appears,81
NA,to be based on trade union pressure which has,81
NA,arisen out of the problem of preferences.,81
NA,Members of the Opposition do not seem to be,81
NA,concerned about the principles involved.,81
NA,I congratulate Mr Justice Williams on the ex-,81
NA,tremely comprehensive report which he,81
NA,produced. His findings on the Narcotics Bureau,81
NA,were clear-cut and straightforward. All too often,81
NA,royal commissioners or other persons who con-,81
NA,recduct inquiries produce vague recommendations,81
NA,"of and results. In this case, however, His Honour",81
NA,stated as the first recommendation of the interim,81
NA,"which is repeated in the main report, that",81
NA,the Narcotics Bureau be disbanded. The Bureau,81
NA,telehas been disbanded and the Government has,81
NA,complied with the recommendation,81
NA,moof the commissioner. He recommended that,81
NA,officers be given the option of transferring to the,81
NA,Australian Federal Police or remaining within,81
NA,Public Service. The Government has decided,81
NA,that the best interests of society are served by,81
NA,altergiving the Commissioner of Police the oppor-,81
NA,tunity to assess those officers who are qualified to,81
NA,"become police officers, and allowing them to be-",81
NA,come members of the new Australian police,81
NA,"force. The rights of the remaining personnel, of",81
NA,"we can look course, will be protected.",81
NA,There is no substance in the point made by the,81
NA,have honourable member for Kingsford-Smith ( Mr,81
NA,be Lionel Bowen) that there will be a fear on the,81
NA,of the Australian police to work with the,81
NA,is officers transferred providing the decision is,81
NA,bemade by the Commissioner. I am sure that we all,81
NA,"have great confidence in Sir Colin Woods, who",81
NA,came to Australia with a very high reputation,81
NA,"and who is renowned for his work, particularly in",81
NA,relation to terrorism and drugs. This Bill is ab-,81
NA,solutely necessary to enable the Commissioner to,81
NA,go about his duties. If we do not pass the Bill it,82
NA,"will not be possible for this new scheme, the new",82
NA,National Crime Intelligence Bureau or the com-,82
NA,bined drug squad to come into operation. Plan-,82
NA,ning is proceeding for both those organisations,82
NA,to become active in the very near future.,82
NA,The amendment proposed by the Opposition,82
NA,is spurious. It is based on pandering to trade legislation.,82
NA,union pressure. It refers to the creation of a,82
NA,further major component of the AustraUan Fed-,82
NA,eral Police. This runs completely contrary to,82
NA,intentions of Mr Justice Williams as stated in the,82
NA,report of the Australian Royal Commission of,82
NA,Inquiry into Drugs. On page B72 he stated:,82
NA,It is desirable that criminal activities be investigated,82
NA,police and not by public servants.,82
NA,Later His Honour said that it was important that,82
NA,persons obtain overall training in the poUce force,82
NA,"in a wide range of matters, particularly in view",82
NA,the interrelated aspects of crime in our society.,82
NA,Once they have received that wide range of trainreau,82
NA,"ing, then they are able to be detaUed to certain",82
NA,tasks such as drug activities. I ask the Governtapes.,82
NA,"ment to take all necessary measures, as I hope",82
NA,"this BUl wUl provide, to enable the Com-",82
NA,missioner to arrange for his officers to,82
NA,seconded to State police forces to permit them,82
NA,acquire additional expertise in drug law enforcegation,82
NA,"ment, particularly in view of the second of",82
NA,recommendations on page B180 of the report by,82
NA,Mr Justice Williams.,82
NA,I speak for all members of the House in conthe,82
NA,gratulating the Government on taking these,82
NA,actions that are necessary to assist in the,82
NA,ing and determined war against drugs. I end this,82
NA,very short contribution with congratulations to,82
NA,the former Minister for Business and Consumer,82
NA,"Affairs, the honourable member for Farrer ( Mr",82
NA,Fife). He came under disgraceful attack from the,82
NA,Opposition. What more could the Minister have civil,82
NA,done than to be a moving force in the establishofficers,82
NA,ment of a royal commission? What more could,82
NA,"he have done than to ensure that, as far as he was",82
NA,"able, the report of that royal commission was put",82
NA,into practice by the Government? For the Oppooutset-m,82
NA,sition to attack him I beUeve was most disgracethat,82
NA,ful. It knows that in these delicate matters he,82
NA,to wait for the commissioner's report. It knew,82
NA,many of the matters were being dealt with in prifactory'.,82
NA,vate and it knew that his hands were tied by,82
NA,very proper action he had taken.,82
NA,"Finally, because the Minister for Administratness.",82
NA,ive Services ( Mr John MCLeay) must reply,82
NA,fore 11 o'clock I make a passing comment. It is,82
NA,regrettable that the honourable member for,82
NA,Prospect (Dr Klugman) no longer has been ofthe AFP.,82
NA,given the opportunity to participate in debates,82
NA,on other matters in relation to health. Formerly,82
NA,his shadow portfolio was in this field. He made a,82
NA,fair effort in relation to what he was doing today.,82
NA,It is obvious that his heart is not in the amend-,82
NA,ment. I strongly oppose the amendment and sup-,82
NA,port the Bill. All members of this House should,82
NA,strongly support this extremely important social,82
Mr JOHN MCLEAY ,Boothby-Minister for,82
NA,the Administrative Services) (10.55)- Mr Deputy,82
NA,"Speaker, because of the time factor all of us are",82
NA,under some disability in making contributions to,82
NA,this debate. I understand that arrangements have,82
NA,by been made for us to suspend the 11 p.m. rule so,82
NA,that the Bill can be dealt with tonight. I will deal,82
NA,as briefly as possible with a couple of the points,82
NA,raised by the Opposition speakers. I think it is,82
NA,fair to say that both of them expressed consider-,82
NA,of able concern that there may be extensive corrup-,82
NA,tion throughout that portion of the Narcotics Bu-,82
NA,which has been transferred. In that context,82
NA,both speakers referred to the so-called Wilson,82
NA,The honourable member for Prospect (Dr,82
NA,be Klugman) was concerned that there had not,82
NA,to been a report to this House on them. The investi-,82
NA,of this matter by the task force which has,82
NA,the been set up is now complete. Several persons,82
NA,"have been charged and, in fact, the matter is still",82
NA,"part heard. It is, therefore, sub judice. It is being",82
NA,heard in the magistrates court in Sydney. Most of,82
NA,time we are all free to go to listen to the case.,82
NA,In Question Time this morning the honourable,82
NA,unceasmember for Prospect queried the number of,82
NA,officers who had been transferred. I would like to,82
NA,confirm the figures that I gave him. I think I said,82
NA,that 84 investigative officers were transferred. In,82
NA,"fact, 86 officers have been transferred and will",82
NA,become police officers and 29 officers remain as,82
NA,servants. I place on record that none of these,82
NA,are among those who have been charged.,82
NA,I trust that we have laid that matter to rest.,82
NA,"Dealing with the amendment, I must say at the",82
NA,y colleague has just confirmed this-,82
NA,the Government does not accept it. I reject,82
NA,had the suggestion that the proposed arrangements,82
NA,for the transfer to the Federal Police are 'unsatis-,82
NA,I submit that neither of the Opposition,82
NA,the speakers have shown in any way where that,82
NA,"transfer is unsatisfactory. In fact, the amendment",82
NA,refers to the production of anomalies and unfair-,82
NA,It seems to me that any unfairness in the BUl,82
NA,beis what this amendment is all about.,82
Dr KLUGMAN ,Unfai r to the present members,82
Mr JOHN MCLEAY, I refer the honourable,83
NA,member to the second reading speech. I know,83
NA,that he expressed some concern about unfairness,83
NA,to the present members of the AFP. Both Oppo-,83
NA,sition speakers have implied or said straight out,83
NA,that in some way the present members have been,83
NA,disadvantaged. I draw the honourable member's,83
NA,"attention to the second reading speech, which I",83
NA,believe deals with that. If he reads page 2 he will,83
NA,see that the purpose of the Bill is to enable the,83
NA,Government's decision to transfer the Narcotics,83
NA,Bureau to the police to be implemented by,83
NA,empowering the appointment as full members of,83
NA,the AFP of those former Narcotics Bureau staff,83
NA,who are selected by the Commissioner as,83
NA,qualified and suitable for appointment as police,83
NA,officers. In response to the Deputy Leader of the,83
NA,"Opposition, contrary to what he said, this was in",83
NA,fact a recommendation of Mr Justice Williams. It,83
NA,"did not, as he said,flyin the face of the Williams",83
NA,"report. It was, in fact, the recommendation of Mr",83
NA,Justice Williams.,83
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,Yo u know the secret,83
NA,report.,83
Mr JOHN MCLEAY, I am referring to the,83
NA,statement the Deputy Leader of the Opposition,83
NA,made a few minutes ago. I am drawing his atten-,83
NA,"tion to the second reading speech, which im-",83
NA,plements the recommendations of Mr Justice,83
NA,Williams. I should like to elaborate on that point,83
NA,and deal with the alleged disadvantage. In my,83
NA,"second reading speech, I stated:",83
NA,Such amendments apply only to this small special group,83
NA,entrants to police ranks. Thus the preference for,83
NA,members from the former two Police Forces is preserved,83
NA,generally.,83
NA,That is a fact. I now deal with thefirstpart of the,83
NA,amendment. It advocates that there should be a accept them.,83
NA,further major component of the Australian Fed-,83
NA,eral Police. There are now two components in,83
NA,the AFP-th e general duties component and,83
NA,protective services component. The Opposition's,83
NA,amendment seeks to create a third component. I,83
NA,find that quite illogical. I admit that the honour-,83
NA,able member for Prospect was not the Oppo-,83
NA,sition spokesman on this matter at the time the,83
NA,Bill was originally introduced. I think that the,83
NA,thrust ofthe Australian Labor Party's opposition,83
NA,"to the Bill, as expressed then by the honourable",83
NA,"member for Melbourne ( Mr Innes), was directed",83
NA,at the creation of a two-component force. Now Adermann. A. E.,83
NA,"within months, the Opposition wants to create a Aldrcd. K.J.",83
NA,three-component force. It is completely illogical. Baillieu. M.,83
NA,The second part ofthe Opposition's amendment Dime}.,83
NA,stales:,83
NA,"The proposed component to comprise AFP officers,",83
NA,together with a significant number of experienced officers,83
NA,seconded from State Police Forces-,83
NA,It makes the suggestion that there should be a,83
NA,composition of State and Federal police in this,83
NA,third component. There is already good co-,83
NA,operation with the State police forces. The com-,83
NA,missioners from all States and the Territories,83
NA,have met twice and have discussed provision of,83
NA,common services. They have agreed-obviousl y,83
NA,this is subject to government approval-o n the,83
NA,transfer of the police college from Manly to,83
NA,Canberra. They have agreed on the development,83
NA,of a national police research and planning office.,83
NA,They have agreed on the establishment of an,83
NA,Australian bureau of criminal intelligence which,83
NA,will include members from all the State forces.,83
NA,The third part of the amendment states:,83
NA,an arrangement whereby former members-,83
NA,I take it that this is the third component-,83
NA,of the Narcotics Bureau who seek transfer to the Aus-,83
NA,"tralian Federal Police, and who are considered qualified in",83
NA,"this respect by the Commissioner, may be appointed as",83
NA,officers or non-commissioned officers of the proposed new,83
NA,narcotics component.,83
NA,That is precisely what we are doing. Further-,83
NA,"more, what can be described as a narcotics div-",83
NA,ision has been established in the Australian Fed-,83
NA,eral Police. It has been reorganised to include,83
NA,staff of the former Narcotics Bureau and Federal,83
NA,Police under the leadership of Assistant Com-,83
NA,missioner John Reilly. It includes a great many,83
NA,"experienced policemen, including members of",83
NA,the Australian Capital Territory Police drug,83
NA,"squad, which squad is highly regarded by all",83
NA,of police forces in the country. I have a great affec-,83
NA,"the tion for the honourable member for Prospect,",83
NA,"who has moved this amendment, but I think the",83
NA,three parts of his amendment are completely il-,83
NA,logical and quite silly. The Government cannot,83
NA,Question put:,83
NA,That the words proposed to be omitted (Dr Kltigman's,83
NA,the amendment) stand part of the question.,83

Mr STALEY ,Th e answer to the honourable,86
NA,member's question is as follows:,86
NA,"(1) For the past two years, the annual figure has been ap-",86
NA,"proximately 800,000.",86
NA,(2) Although periods of redirection are recorded at indi-,86
NA,"vidual post offices, details are not available in a consolidated",86
NA,form.,86
NA,(3) Details are not available. Renewals of redirection,86
NA,orders are treated as new orders.,86
NA,(4) See (2) and (3) above. Renewals operate for the,86
NA,length of time requested by the customer. ('Temporary',86
NA,redirections are restricted to a maximum period of one year.),86
NA,(5) The scale of charges for redirection orders is as,86
NA,follows:,86

NA,(Question No. S392),86
NA,Mr Innes asked the Minister for Post and,86
NA,"Telecommunications, upon notice, on 20",86
NA,February 1980:,86
NA,(1) Is terrestrial equipment which is necessaiy to enable,86
NA,complete newspaper pages to be electronically transmitted,86
NA,"between Australian cities (a) currently installed, (b)",86
NA,"planned, or (c) operational elsewhere.",86
NA,(2) Who (a) owns and operates the varying parts of the,86
NA,"technology if terrestrial equipment is currently installed, or",86
NA,(b) will own or operate the varying parts of the technology if,86
NA,the equipment is planned for installation.,86
NA,"(3) Is this equipment planned for (a) introduction, or (b)",86
NA,"commercial use in Australia; if so, when.",86
NA,(4) What are the costs of installing equipment capable of,86
NA,these transmissions between capital cities.,86
Mr STALEY ,Th e answer to the honourable,86
NA,member's question is as follows:,86
NA,(Question No. 5290),86
NA,(1) Terrestrial equipment used to enable complete,86
NA,newspaper pages to be electronically transmitted between,86
NA,cities is in operation in Australia.,86
NA,(2) Telecom Australia's involvement in these services is,86
NA,limited to providing suitable transmission facilities. Telecom,86
NA,acts solely as a common carrier in these instances. The trans-,86
NA,mission facilities comprise suitably prepared broadened,86
NA,transmission links which are extended to the customers,86
NA,premises. Equipment used for transmitting and receiving the,86
NA,newspaper pages is provided and owned by the customer,86
NA,and is connected to the Telecom network under permitted,86
NA,attachment arrangements. Arrangements for operation and,86
NA,maintenance of the privately owned facsimile equipment is,86
NA,left to the customer.,86
NA,(3) See(l)above.,86
NA,(4) The costs involved in providing the facsimile equip-,86
NA,ment are private to the customer. The transmission facilities,86
NA,for newspapers are provided on a part-time basis and at,86
NA,other times the same equipment is used for public communi-,86
NA,cations purposes. The facilities are provided at a tariff which,86
NA,is appropriate to the bandwidth involved and to the hours of,86
NA,normal usage.,86

NA,(Question No. 5395),86
NA,Mr Innes asked the Minister for Post and,86
NA,"Telecommunications, upon notice, on 20",86
NA,February 1980:,86
NA,"(1) Further to the answer to Quesuon No. 4534 (Hansard,",87
NA,"22 November 1979, pages 3464-5), why does Australia Post",87
NA,operate 26 times as many V8 vehicles as does Telecom,87
NA,"Australia, having as it does, 52 V8s in a total vehicle comp-",87
NA,"lement of 2,262, compared with Telecom's 14 V8s in a fleet",87
NA,"of 16,014.",87
NA,(2) Why does Australia Post operate 2.16 times as many 6,87
NA,"cylinder vehicles as does Telecom, having as it does, 1,527 6",87
NA,"cylinder vehicles in a total vehicle complement of 2,262,",87
NA,"compared with Telecom's 5,000 6 cylinder vehicles in a fleet",87
NA,"of 16,014.",87
NA,(3) Why does Australia Post operate 0.44 times as many,87
NA,cylinder vehicles as does Telecom.,87
Mr STALEY ,Th e answer to the honourable,87
NA,member's question is as follows:,87
NA,(1) to (3) It is suggested that the honourable member,87
NA,have misinterpreted my answer to,87
NA,4534. It will be noted in part,87
NA,"dition to the totals given, Telecom Australia operates 6,000",87
NA,heavy trucks which have either V8 or 6 cylinder,87
NA,"bringing Telecom's total vehicle complement to 22,014.",87
NA,"When this is taken into account,",87
NA,"question, Australia Post in fact operates only",87
NA,many V8 and 6 cylinder vehicles as does Telecom Australia.,87
NA,"Similarly, Australia Post operates 0.6 times as many four",87
NA,inder vehicles in its fleet in comparison with Telecom,87
NA,Australia.,87
NA,"Australia Post and Telecom Australia, however, should be",87
NA,viewed as separate entities. Direct comparison between the,87
NA,Commissions' fleets is not considered appropriate,87
NA,the widely different nature of the services they offer. Most of,87
NA,Australia Post's larger engine vehicles,87
NA,fore the current drive to conserve,87
NA,gressively considered for replacement by vehicles with,87
NA,smaller engines at the appropriate time.,87

NA,employed in (a) the production of commodities for export,87
NA,"(including food, minerals, wool and manufactured goods)",87
NA,and (b) the production of goods which are subject to direct,87
NA,import competition.,87
Mr VINER ,Th e answer to the honourable,87
NA,member's question is as follows:,87
NA,Official statistics of actual employment in the activities,87
NA,ferred to in the honourable member's quesuon are not,87
NA,collected.,87
NA,The only available official statistics relating to employ-,87
NA,ment are classified by broad industry groups. Within these,87
NA,"groups, individual businesses may be involved in the pro-",87
NA,"duction of goods for the domestic market only, for the export",87
NA,"market only, or both. It is",87
NA,the breakdown of the Australian labour force asked for.,87
NA,"However, persons interested in making broad estimates of",87
NA,the proportion of the Australian labour force engaged in the,87
NA,activities mentioned could derive rough figures on the basis,87
NA,of available employment statistics in associauon with other,87

Mr STALEY ,Th e answer to the honourable,88
NA,member's question is as follows:,88
NA,(1) Recommendation 51-Th e transmitter for 3EA Mel-,88
NA,bourne began broadcasting on 5kW in January 1980 and the,88
NA,upgrading of 2EA is expected to be completed by the end of,88
NA,April 1980. Wollongong and Newcastle have been linked to,88
NA,2EA by way of translator stations which began broadcasting,88
NA,in August 1979.,88
NA,The Government has yet to consider a timetable and,88
NA,method for the extension of ethnic radio to the other centres,88
NA,"mentioned in the Galbally report. In the meantime, the SBS",88
NA,subsidises ethnic radio on public broadcasting stations in,88
NA,these and other centres.,88
NA,"Recommendation 52- A survey of Italian, Serbo-",88
NA,"Croatian, Spanish and Arabic listeners to ethnic radio in",88
NA,Sydney and Melbourne was conducted in June 1978. It is,88

NA,March 1980:,88
NA,When will single sideband transmission for the inter-,88
NA,national distress frequency be available for marine radios in,88
NA,Australia as it is in the United States of America.,88
Mr STALEY ,Th e answer to the honourable,88
NA,member's question is as follows:,88
NA,The World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC) of,88
NA,the International Telecommunication Union which met at,88
NA,Geneva in late 1979 considered the use of a single sideband,88
NA,(SSB) techniques for distress and safety purposes on the dis-,88
NA,tress frequency 2182 kHz. Although the Conference recog-,88
NA,nised the inherent operational advantages of SSB to the cur-,88
NA,"rently employed double sideband (DSB) mode, it also",88
NA,identified that SSB equipment must be designed to work,88
NA,with closer frequency tolerance and higher technical stan-,88
NA,dards than those necessary for DSB equipment.,88
NA,"To this end, the WARC resolved that continuation of the",88
NA,"study of the use of SSB for distress and safety purposes, now",88
NA,"being undertaken by a technical committee of the Union, is",88
NA,required but added that arecommendationshould be made,88
NA,sufficiently in advance of the next WARC competent to deal,88
NA,with the matter.,88
NA,"In view of this Resolution of the 1979 WARC, it would",88
NA,seem unwise for Australia to deviate from the currently ac-,88
NA,cepted world practice without full consideration being given,88
NA,to the matter.,88
NA,"In the meantime, the Australian Administration in con-",88
NA,forming with the International Radio Regulations has,88
NA,elected to continue authorising proven DSB techniques for,88

NA,puting equipment for the CSIRO.,89
NA,(2) What offset has been provided for any subsequent,89
NA,supplies of computing equipment by Facomfor use by the,89
NA,CSIRO.,89
NA,Mr Newman-Th e answer to the honourable,89
NA,member's question is as follows:,89
NA,"(1) None, because the CSIRO has only purchased one",89
NA,"small computer from Facom, and the amount involved was",89
NA,less than the threshold at which onsets are required.,89
NA,"(2) None, because there have been no subsequent pur-",89

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr J. 3. Clark),11

NA,prayers.,11
NA,INCOME TAX.,11
Mr THOMPSON ,Complaint s have,11
NA,been made to me by many men that on the,11
NA,death of their parents they have arranged,11
NA,for an elderly sister to look after their,11
NA,"home, and that they have not been able",11
NA,to claim a concessional rebate for income,11
NA,tax purposes in respect of the services of,11
NA,"the sister, but that taxpayers are able to",11
NA,claim such concessions in respect of de,11
NA,"facto wives. ""Will the Treasurer state",11
NA,whether consideration has been given to,11
NA,"this matter, and i f so, whether it is",11
NA,possible for further consideration to be,11
NA,given to the desirability of allowing con-,11
NA,cessional rebates to taxpayers in such,11
NA,circumstances 3,11
Mr CHIFLEY ,Th e Bubjeet raised,11
NA,by the honorable member has been con-,11
NA,sidered by a number of Treasurers and,11
NA,governments. I do not think that the,11
NA,position of a de facto wife is analogous,11
NA,to that of a sister who is looking after a,11
NA,single man. A de facto wife occupies a,11
NA,somowhat different position in the home,11
NA,from that of a sister. The conditions,11
NA,governing thc allowance of concessional,11
NA,rates in respeot of de facto wives are,11
NA,"fairly strict, and have regard to the",11
NA,character of the union and to children,11
NA,that might result from it. This subject,11
NA,has been considered on a number of,11
NA,occasions because of the continual re-,11
NA,quests that have heen made that the con-,11
NA,cessional rebate should be extended to,11
NA,cover taxpayers such as those mentioned,11
NA,by the honorable member. Up to the,11
NA,present the Government has not been able,11
NA,to see its way clear to allow a rebate in,11
NA,respect of sisters who occupy such a posi-,11
NA,tion hi the home because such a practice,11
NA,"would be open to very great ""aBuses,",11
NA,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,11
NA,GBAMOPHONE RECORDS.,11
Mr HARRISON ,Som e time ago 1,11
NA,askod the Attorney-General a question,11
NA,in relation to the impounding of some,11
NA,gramophono records which had been,11
NA,"brought to Australia by Mr Dixon, the",11
NA,well-known Communist. I asked the,11
NA,right honorahle gentleman whether he,11
NA,would have the records examined in order,11
NA,to ascertain whether or not they contained,11
NA,certain forms of propaganda. Has he,11
NA,yet had an opportunity to institute an,11
NA,inquiry to ascertain the nature pf the,11
NA,"records, and, i f so, can he give the House",11
NA,any information on the subject?,11
Dr EVATT ,Th e honorable member,11
NA,mentioned this matter on the 30th,11
NA,September last. I t relates to the adminis-,11
NA,tration by the Department of Trade and,11
NA,Customs of the Customs Act. I,11
NA,referred the honorable member's,11
NA,question to the Minister for Trade,11
NA,and Customs but I have not yet re-,11
NA,ceived a reply. A reply will be furnished,11
NA,to the honorable member by the Mimster,11
NA,representing the Minister for Trade and,11
NA,Customs in this House. Power is con-,12
NA,tained in the Customs Act for the depart-,12
NA,ment to detain certain types of records.,12
NA,As I have already informed the honorable,12
NA,"member, I do not know what is contained",12
NA,on the records to which he has drawn,12
NA,"attention. However, I am obliged to the",12
NA,honorable member for reminding me of,12
NA,the matter.,12
NA,HIGH COURT.,12
Mr DALY ,Ha s the Attorney-,12
NA,General seen a statement attributed to the,12
NA,"honorable member for Warringah, in",12
NA,which the honorable member is reported,12
NA,"to have stated that, i f Labour is returned",12
NA,"to office, the people might expect the",12
NA,High Court to be stacked with Labour,12
NA,supporters? Does the Attorney-General,12
NA,not consider that statement to be,12
NA,"inaccurate, misleading and utterly false?",12
NA,Will the right honorable gentleman out-,12
NA,line to the House the appointments that,12
NA,have been made to the High Court since,12
NA,"Labour assumed office in 1941, and state",12
NA,whether or not the Government has,12
NA,already had ample opportunity-,12
Mr ANTHONY , I rise to order. I,12
NA,"submit, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the",12
NA,honorable member is not asking a question,12
NA,but is inviting the Attorney-General to,12
NA,make a statement on a matter of general,12
NA,"policy. I n so doing, I contend that the",12
NA,honorable member is out of order.,12
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Th e,12
NA,Chair's impression is that the honorable,12
NA,member for Martin is asking the,12
NA,Attorney-General what appointments,12
NA,have been made to the High Court during,12
NA,a certain period. He is entitled to ask,12
NA,that question.,12
Mr DALY ,"Finally , I ask tht.",12
NA,Attorney-General whether it is true that,12
NA,the Government has already had an oppor-,12
NA,tunity to stack the High Court had it,12
NA,"wished to do so, but so far from doing so,",12
NA,it has actually appointed only one justice,12
NA,since 1941.,12
Dr EVATT ,M y attention was,12
NA,directed last night toa statement made,12
NA,"by the honorable member for Warringah,",12
NA,"and, I think, repeated at the week-end",12
NA,"by another Opposition member, the",12
NA,Leader of the Australian Country party.,12
NA,I take this opportunity to say' that the,12
NA,statement is completely inaccurate. I t is,12
NA,a complete untruth from beginning to end.,12
NA,The matter has never been considered,12
NA,"by the Government, and such a thought",12
NA,has never occurred to members of,12
NA,the Government. There has been only,12
NA,one vacancy on the High Court bench,12
NA,during the regime of the Curtin and,12
NA,Chifley Administrations. The Govern-,12
NA,ment's appointee to that vacancy was tho,12
NA,"then Chief Justice of Queensland, Sir",12
NA,"William Webb, and not the slightest",12
NA,objection to his appointment was raised,12
NA,"by any member of this House, or any",12
NA,"political party, or any representative of",12
NA,the legal profession of Australia. The,12
NA,same may be said without exception of,12
NA,other judicial appointments made by this,12
NA,Government. There has not been one,12
NA,-breath of criticism of such appointments.,12
NA,"Therefore, I say that i t is wrong and",12
NA,wicked that statements such as that re-,12
NA,ferred to by the honorable member foT,12
NA,"Martin should be made, without authority,",12
NA,in an attempt to mislead the people.,12
NA,"Clearly, there is no justification for the",12
NA,statement.,12
Mr ANTHONY ,Wh y not hold a,12
NA,referendum on banking?,12
Dr EVATT,Th e honorable member,12
NA,for Richmond now talks about a referen-,12
NA,dum. I pointed out yesterday in answer,12
NA,"to another honorable member that, during",12
NA,"the whole period of the war, a vast per-",12
NA,centage of the High Court's decisions,12
NA,favoured the Government. The question,12
NA,of additions to the High Court Bench is,12
NA,"not being considered, and, to use the words",12
NA,"of the honorable member for Martin, the",12
NA,statement to which he has referred is,12
NA,"inaccurate, misleading and utterly false,",12
NA,"but I prefer to call it a simple, downright",12
NA,untruth.,12
Mr MENZIES ,Tim e will tell.,12
NA,CANBERRA.,12
NA,LOCAL GOVERNMENT.,12
Mr BLAIN , I ask the Minister for,12
NA,the Interior whether he has read the,12
NA,report on civic administration made by,12
NA,"Mr H . J. R, Cole, A.l.C.A., Town Clerk",12
NA,"of Hobart, which recommends the estab-",12
NA,lishment of a city council for Canberra.,12
NA,"Tf so, will the Minister consider making",12
NA,similar provision for Darwin and Alice,12
NA,Springs? I draw tho Minister's atten-,13
NA,tion to the foUowing passage which,13
NA,appears on page 9 of Mr Cole's report:-,13
NA,The difference between the maintenance,13
NA,tion of the vote and the revenue derived from,13
NA,"the residents in rates, fees, charges and fares,",13
NA,is in effect a Federal subsidy to' the local,13
NA,government of the city.,13
NA,"""Will the Minister bear that statement in",13
NA,"mind when he establishes, as I hope that",13
NA,"he will establish, councils in Darwin and",13
NA,Alice Springs?,13
Mr JOHNSON , I have read the re-,13
NA,port that has been submitted to the Go-,13
NA,vernment by Mr Cole. I t is now being,13
NA,considered by an inter-departmental com-,13
NA,mittee that has been established for the,13
NA,purpose of making recommendations re-,13
NA,garding the implementation of Mr Cole's,13
NA,proposals i f they are considered to be,13
NA,appropriate to the Australia]! Capital,13
NA,Territory. I t is too early to say what will,13
NA,be the outcome of the very comprehensive,13
NA,report that Mr Cole has prepared. I,13
NA,have not yet received the recom-,13
NA,mendations of the inter-departmental,13
NA,committee to which I have re-,13
NA,ferred. The honorable gentleman has,13
NA,asked whether councils will be estab-,13
NA,lished in Darwin and Alice Springs,13
NA,if one is established in Canberra. That,13
NA,"matter will be considered, i f neces-",13
NA,"sary, at a later stage.",13
NA,TRUSTEESHIP TERRITORIES.,13
Mr BEASLEY ,"M y question, which",13
NA,is addressed to the Minister for,13
NA,"External Affairs, in the absence of",13
NA,the Minister for External Terri-,13
NA,"tories, relates to the criticism of the",13
NA,administration of Australian trusteeship,13
NA,territories that was voiced by the,13
NA,Russian delegate at a recent meeting of,13
NA,the Trusteeship Council of the United,13
NA,Nations. The Russian delegate stated,13
NA,that no steps have been taken by the Aus-,13
NA,tralian Government to place natives in,13
NA,charge of any aspect of the administra-,13
NA,tion of its trusteeship territories. Is,13
NA,the Minister in a position to inform,13
NA,me whether that statement i9 true?,13
NA,If natives have not yet been,13
NA,appointed to any significant posts,13
NA,"in the administration, are any steps",13
NA,being taken to so appoint them? Are any,13
NA,natives being trained for such purposes?,13
NA,"I f they are, what is the nature of the posts",13
NA,to which they may be appointed,13
NA,and where is the training taking place?,13
Dr EVATT , I am aware of the,13
NA,por- general nature of the attacks to which,13
NA,the honorable gentleman has referred.,13
NA,They were made not only by Russia but,13
NA,also by other countries. The Australian,13
NA,delegates at Lake Success replied to them.,13
NA,I cannot say offhand the present stage of,13
NA,the plans of the Minister for External,13
NA,Territories to provide for natives hearing,13
NA,some degree of administrative responsi-,13
NA,bility in the territories. I shall obtain,13
NA,the information for the benefit of the,13
NA,honorable gentleman and inform him,13
NA,accordingly.,13
NA,SOMERS CAMP.,13
Mr RYAN ,M y question relates to a,13
NA,recent transaction in which the Govern-,13
NA,"ment purchased for £145,000 a property",13
NA,known as Somers Camp and which they,13
NA,"sold two years ago for £20,000. Is",13
NA,the Minister for the Interior aware that,13
NA,the shareholders of the company that,13
NA,bought the property two years ago have,13
NA,"made a profit of 100 per cent, in the",13
NA,transaction ? Were they enabled to do so,13
NA,as a result of the actions of the Depart-,13
NA,ment of the Interior? Does this profit,13
NA,come out of the public funds? Will the,13
NA,Minister lay on the table the file relative,13
NA,to the transaction?,13
Mr JOHNSON , I have already ex-,13
NA,plained very fully the whole of the circum-,13
NA,stances of the acquisition of the property,13
NA,in Victoria that is known as Somers,13
NA,Camp. The business was carried out,13
NA,under the provisions of the Lands,13
NA,Acquisition Act. When properties,13
NA,are to be acquired by the Com-,13
NA,"monwealth, sworn valuators are engaged",13
NA,by the Australian Government to value,13
NA,the property that is to be acquired. Those,13
NA,valuations are then checked by the Com-,13
NA,missioner of Taxation or by some of his,13
NA,officers. When there is a divergence in,13
NA,"valuations, a conference of the valuators",13
NA,is held before any recommendation is,13
NA,made to me by my officers. I shall,13
NA,make the file available to the honorable,13
NA,member for Flinders because the valua-,13
NA,tions were sound and there is nothing to,13
NA,hide. After a question was asked in the,13
NA,House recently concerning this matter T,13
NA,examined the papers with an officer of,13
NA,"tlie Department of the Interior, and",14
NA,am convinced that the purchase of the action,14
NA,land at the figure quoted by the honorable,14
NA,member for Flinders was quite justified.,14
NA,PROPOSED MINISTRY OF,14
NA,HOUSEKEEPING.,14
Mrs BLACKBURN,Ca n the Prime submit,14
NA,Minister say whether he has received,14
NA,request from the Federated Association,14
NA,of Australian Housewives in terms of a,14
NA,resolution passed by the members of that,14
NA,body at a recent conference advocating,14
NA,the establishment of a department of,14
NA,housekeeping and the administration of,14
NA,that department by a woman Minister?,14
NA,Can the right honorable gentleman inform,14
NA,the House of the details of similar action,14
NA,taken in Denmark and in other European,14
NA,"countries? Does he agree that, in place",14
NA,of concentration on various matters,14
NA,"ing the war, for the administration",14
NA,which Commonwealth departments were:,14
NA,"established but have now ceased to exist,",14
NA,our domestic problems should receive a,14
NA,high priority?,14
Mr CHIFLEY , I bave received remost,14
NA,"presentations from' one, and maybe",14
NA,organizations advocating the appointment,14
NA,of a Minister for housekeeping or thc,14
NA,allocation to such a service of a Minister,14
NA,with some similar appropriate title.,14
NA,head of the Government charged with,14
NA,"the duty of allocating portfolios, I",14
NA,"given consideration to the matter, but at to the honorable member that the",14
NA,the moment I cannot approve of the,14
NA,establishment of such a portfolio. I n any,14
NA,"event, honorable members would probably",14
NA,refer to the holder of the suggested,14
NA,"portfolio by such a term as "" Mother",14
NA,"Hubbard"" or by some similar colto",14
NA,loquialism. Whilst I understand that,14
NA,"in one or two countries, notably",14
NA,"Denmark, action has been taken along",14
NA,the lines indicated hy the honorable,14
NA,"member, I shall ascertain exactly what",14
NA,has been done in this aspect of social,14
NA,and when I have obtained that informathe,14
NA,tion I shall give further consideration,14
NA,the honorable member's request.,14
NA,NATIONAL WORKS PROGRAMME.,14
Mr BERNARD CORSER , An-,14
NA,nouncements are made from time to time,14
NA,that particular works in the works,14
NA,grammes of the States have been approved,14
NA,by the National Works Council. Will,14
NA,I the Prime Minister indicate what local,14
NA,is necessary for local authorities to,14
NA,"have proposed works, such as the con-,",14
NA,struction of shipping ports and the pro-,14
NA,"vision of water facilities, included in the",14
NA,national works programme?,14
Mr CHIFLEY ,Loca l authorities,14
NA,particulars of projects that they,14
NA,a desire to have included in the national,14
NA,works programme to State governments in,14
NA,the first instance. The projects are then,14
NA,referred to the co-ordinator of works in,14
NA,each State. I think that Mr Kemp is,14
NA,the co-ordinator of works in Queensland,14
NA,and that Mr Swift is the co-ordinator of,14
NA,works in New South Wales. I n the other,14
NA,States various officers have been appointed,14
NA,by the State governments to co-ordinate,14
NA,the works programmes of the States. Con-,14
NA,sultation then takes place between the,14
NA,durState co-ordinator of works and the,14
NA,of Commonwealth Co-ordinator-General of,14
NA,"Works, and those officials are guided in",14
NA,their deliberations very largely by the,14
NA,availability of materials and labour. Thfty,14
NA,"then set out what, in their view, are the",14
NA,"urgent works, and the Co-ordinator-",14
NA,"two, General of Works makes reports and",14
NA,recommendations to the National Works,14
NA,Council of the order of urgency that,14
NA,"should be given to the various projects,",14
NA,"As always, of course, on the understanding",14
NA,that money is available to carry out the,14
NA,have works. Perhaps I should make it clear,14
NA,v,14
NA,Premiers themselves do not desire the,14
NA,general publication of all the lists of works,14
NA,"that have been approved, because from",14
NA,time to time they may wish to alter the,14
NA,order pf priority that has been allotted,14
NA,projects in the respective States. The,14
NA,Commonwealth Co-ordinator-General of,14
NA,Works is guided by the State co-ordi-,14
NA,nators of works. J f a State body desires,14
NA,"to have certain proposals considered, its",14
NA,representations should be made to the,14
NA,"life, State Government and be dealt with by",14
NA,State co-ordinator before the matter is,14
NA,to raised with the Commonwealth Co-,14
NA,ordinator-General of Works.,14
NA,PETROL.,14
Mr GEORGE LAWSON ,Wil l the,14
NA,proPrime Minister infonn me whether,14
NA,"it is a fact, as reported in the",14
NA,"Melbourne press last Saturday, that",14
NA,he has received advices from the Act-,15
NA,ing High Commissioner for Australia in,15
NA,"the United Kingdom, Mr Norman",15
NA,"Mighell, to the effect that the Polish",15
NA,Government has refused to supply petrol,15
NA,"to Australia? I f that is a fact, has the",15
NA,Tight honorable gentleman any comment,15
NA,"to make upon the matter, particularly in",15
NA,view of the many statements that have,15
NA,been made by leaders of the Opposition,15
NA,parties in the tory press that petrol was,15
NA,available from Poland for the asking?,15
Mr CHIFLEY , I made a comment,15
NA,"earlier about the matter, and I have no",15
NA,-desire to add to i t now. The position is,15
NA,.thait an Australian company submitted,15
NA,.a request to the Commonwealth for a,15
NA,licence to import petrol from Poland.,15
NA,"-Speaking from memory, I believe that",15
NA,the petrol was to be loaded at Stettin.,15
NA,We were not quite sure about the currency,15
NA,"position, and, naturally, we consulted the",15
NA,Bank of England and the United King-,15
NA,"<d©in Treasury, which are the British",15
NA,authorities responsible for exchange con-,15
NA,"trol in regard to dollars, in order to",15
NA,ourselves about the situation. We inti-,15
NA,mated to the applicant company that i f,15
NA,"it could buy petrol for sterling, and pay",15
NA,the freight and insurance charges in,15
NA,"sterling, the import licence would be",15
NA,"granted. Later, I received from the",15
NA,Acting High Commissioner for Aus-,15
NA,tralia i n the United Kingdom a,15
NA,cable i n which he said that the,15
NA,representatives of the applicant com-,15
NA,pany had approached him on the subject.,15
NA,They had found that a difficulty had,15
NA,arisen in obtaining an export licence,15
NA,"from the Polish Government, and they",15
NA,asked whether the Australian Govern-,15
NA,ment would make representations to the,15
NA,Polish Government about the matter. I,15
NA,sent to Mr Mighell a icable in which I,15
NA,asked him to inquire of the Polish repre-,15
NA,"sentative the reasons, i f there were any",15
NA,"reasons, for his Government's decision not",15
NA,to grant the export licence for the petrol,15
NA,"which, the company had said, could be",15
NA,bought in Poland. The Polish Government,15
NA,has briefly informed us that it was not,15
NA,able to grant the export licence. We,15
NA,already knew that it had to bring,15
NA,"crudes from the Persian Gulf to Stettin,",15
NA,and then take them inland for refining.,15
NA,The petrol would be extremely expensive,15
NA,in such circumstances. I understand that,15
NA,Poland has not sufficient petrol to meet its,15
NA,own requirements. The Polish Govern-,15
NA,ment has made it clear that the only,15
NA,reason for its refusal to grant the export,15
NA,licence is the unavailability of petrol.,15
Mr MCEWEN , I ask the Prime,15
NA,Minister whether it is true that the petrol,15
NA,consumption of Commonwealth depart-,15
NA,ments and instrumentalities amounted to,15
NA,"800,000 gallons in June and 942,000 gal-",15
NA,"lons in July, compared with an average",15
NA,"monthly consumption of 680,000 gallons.",15
NA,As the coal strike did not affect consump-,15
NA,"tion in June, what was the reason for the",15
NA,big increase in that month? Will th»,15
NA,Government instruct departments that,15
NA,they must keep their consumption within,15
NA,"the quota of 800,000 gallons a month,",15
NA,which the Prime Minister told the,15
NA,premiers was the Commonwealth's petrol,15
NA,"allocation, just as all other fuel users are",15
NA,compelled to limit their consumption of,15
NA,petrol to quotas? Is it a fact that,15
NA,"numerous new inspectorial activities,",15
NA,which were not previously considered to,15
NA,"satisfy be necessary, are being undertaken by",15
NA,departmental officers with the use of,15
NA,"motor cars, thereby increasing the Com-",15
NA,monwealth's use of fuel?,15
Mr CHIFLEY ,I t is true that the,15
NA,consumption in June was higher than in,15
NA,previous months. I have taken the trouble,15
NA,to make a personal examination of returns,15
NA,which show the use of petrol by Common-,15
NA,wealth departments and by Ministers,15
NA,which have been supplied to me by the,15
NA,Minister for the Interior. I have also,15
NA,asked the Public Service Board to direct,15
NA,its inspectorial staffs in the various States,15
NA,to ensure that petrol is not used for other,15
NA,than what can be reasonably regarded as,15
NA,essential or reasonably essential pur-,15
NA,poses. I made an inquiry into the,15
NA,reason for the increased petrol con-,15
NA,sumption in June and learned that prac-,15
NA,tically all of the fuel was used for,15
NA,"absolutely essential services, mainly in",15
NA,connexion with the carriage of materials.,15
NA,The honorable gentleman mentioned the,15
NA,coal strike. Before the strike actually,15
NA,"commenced coal was being rationed, and",15
NA,the New South Wales Railways Depart-,15
NA,ment had reduced the number of goods,15
NA,trains engaged in the carrying of building,15
NA,"materials, &e. I examined details of the",15
NA,"use of petrol for the month mentioned,",15
NA,and found that at least 90 per eent. was,15
NA,used iu tiie maintenance of essential,16
NA,"services, and in the carrying of neces-",16
NA,"sary materials. That being so, there",16
NA,was no justification for taking anj,16
NA,action against departments or depart-,16
NA,mental officers. I told the Premiers,16
NA,what quantity of petrol was being,16
NA,"used by Oommonwealth departments,",16
NA,but I cannot remember telling them,16
NA,that that quantity -would not be exceeded.,16
NA,I t is obvious that i f there were a com-,16
NA,plete cessation of railway traffic to Can-,16
NA,"berra, where much building is in progress,",16
NA,it would be necessary to use motor lorries,16
NA,to bring cement here from the factories.,16
NA,"Indeed, it is even now very difficult to get",16
NA,cement carried by the railways because of,16
NA,the shortage of trucks. I assure the honor-,16
NA,able member that I have examined,16
NA,particulars of mileages covered by Com-,16
NA,"monwealth vehicles, and the quantity",16
NA,"of petrol consumed. Upon occasions, I",16
NA,have had to take up cases with the Minis-,16
NA,"ters in charge of departments, when",16
NA,I thought that there had been excessive,16
NA,"travelling by administrative officers, and",16
NA,I have asked Ministers to make persona],16
NA,inquiries. There will be no unavoidable,16
NA,use of petrol by Commonwealth,16
NA,departments.,16
NA,Mr ABCHI E CAMEEON -Th e,16
NA,Prime Minister has stated that people who,16
NA,hoard petrol will be dealt with. Since,16
NA,the Commonwealth has no power to,16
NA,"ration petrol, can the Prime Minister say",16
NA,whence it will derive power to prevent,16
NA,"people from hoarding petrol, or to punish",16
NA,them for doing so?,16
Mr CHIFLEY ,Th e point that the,16
NA,honorable meniber has put is that i f some,16
NA,persons-an d the practice has been par-,16
NA,ticularly pronounced among certain,16
NA,wealthy primary producers-hav e hoarded,16
NA,"excessive quantities of petrol, the Go-",16
NA,vernment has no power to take action,16
NA,against them.,16
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON , I ask whenco,16
NA,the Government would obtain power to,16
NA,deal with persons who hoard petrol.,16
Mr CHIFLEY ,Tha t question has,16
NA,been closely examined. Certain legal,16
NA,"difficulties are associated with the matter,",16
NA,but we believe that they can be overcome,16
NA,"not, perhaps, in the way that the honor-",16
NA,"able member thinks, but i n an indirect",16
NA,"way, in the distribution of future supplies",16
NA,of petrol. I shall arrange to have that,16
NA,aspect of the matter explained to the,16
NA,honorable member when there is a law on,16
NA,the subject.,16
NA,CIVIL AVIATION.,16
Mr WHITE ,Ha s the Minister for,16
NA,Civil Aviation seen reports to the effect,16
NA,that Melbourne is likely to be bypassed,16
NA,"in the international air race, which has",16
NA,been organized by New Zealand to taka,16
NA,"place in 1953, because there is no inter-",16
NA,national airport in that city? As Essen-,16
NA,"don is the busiest airport in Australia,",16
NA,and as there is accumulating evidence,16
NA,of disability caused by the lack of inter-,16
NA,national aircraft landing facilities i n,16
NA,"Melbourne, will the Minister review the-",16
NA,decision not to make Melbourne an inter-,16
NA,national airport?,16
Mr DRAKEFORD , I have not read;,16
NA,the reports to which the honorable mem-,16
NA,"ber has referred, but I can quite under-*",16
NA,stand the reasons for the decision not fd,16
NA,make Melbourne a point on the route,16
NA,of the international air race to New Zea-,16
NA,"land. So far as I am aware, that city",16
NA,would not be on the direct track to that,16
NA,"dominion, and competing aircraft would",16
NA,need .to make a diversion in order to pass,16
NA,over Melbourne. The honorable membei,16
NA,has also suggested that Melbourne should,16
NA,also be made an international airport.,16
NA,The explanation why that has not been,16
NA,"done already has been made before,",16
NA,but I repeat it now for the honorable,16
NA,gentleman's information. The agree-,16
NA,ment between the United States of,16
NA,America and Australia provides for an,16
NA,international airport at each terminal.,16
NA,Airports have been established in,16
NA,"accordance with that agreement, and any",16
NA,proposal for a variation of the agreement,16
NA,would have to be made by either the,16
NA,Government of the United States or the,16
NA,"Australian Government. Personally, I",16
NA,see no necessity for such a variation. The,16
NA,net result of making Melbourne an inter-,16
NA,"national airport, and of permitting any",16
NA,international service to terminate at Mel-,16
NA,"bourne, would be that the designated air-",16
NA,"line of the United States of America,",16
NA,"Pan-American Airways, which might be",16
NA,more heavily subsidized than Australian,16
NA,"airlines, would be able to send their air-",16
NA,"craft to Melbourne, and compete with Aus-",16
NA,tralian National Airways Proprietary,16
NA,"Limited, Ansett Airways Proprietary",17
NA,Limited and Trans-Australia Airlines,17
NA,causing a total loss in revenue to the,17
NA,Australian airlines of £400 to £500 a,17
NA,week. No doubt it would cause the,17
NA,honorable member for Balaclava and his,17
NA,associates in the Opposition a great deal,17
NA,of satisfaction i f Australian airlines wero,17
NA,to incur such losses.,17
Mr DUTHIE , I have received repreCasas,17
NA,sentations from the Tasmanian Farmers,17
NA,Federation and from individual farmers,17
NA,who have made overtures to Titan Nail,17
NA,"and Wire Proprietary Limited, of Hobart,",17
NA,in respect of their urgent requirements of,17
NA,"feed wire, which is used in the production",17
NA,of barbed wire and staples. The company,17
NA,"also manufactures nails, and is a great",17
NA,asset to Tasmania's expanding economy.,17
NA,Will the Minister representing the Minis-,17
NA,ter for Supply and Development take,17
NA,action to ascertain whether there is any,17
NA,possibility of increasing Tasmania's quota,17
NA,"of wire feed, which is manufactured at",17
NA,Ryland's works at Newcastle?,17
Mr DEDMAN ,"Unti l recently, the",17
NA,distribution of supplies of wire for the,17
NA,manufacture of nails was under .the juris-,17
NA,diction of the Division of Industrial,17
NA,Development of the Department of Post-,17
NA,"war Reconstruction. However, because",17
NA,the Government was advised that it no,17
NA,longer had any constitutional authority to,17
NA,decide what allocations should be made,17
NA,"to the respective States, it informed the",17
NA,"State governments that, as from the",17
NA,"lst July, it could no longer undertake the",17
NA,task of allocating materials to the States.,17
NA,Although the Commonwealth has no,17
NA,"power in this matter, the Department of",17
NA,Post-war Reconstruction has referred to,17
NA,the manufacturers various representations,17
NA,that have been made to it from time to,17
NA,"time, and the manufacturers have been",17
NA,able to accede to many of those requests.,17
NA,I shall be happy to make representations,17
NA,to the company with a view to securing,17
NA,greater supplies of wire for Tasmania.,17
NA,DEPORTATIONS.,17
Mr LANG ,A t the beginning of this,17
NA,"year, I addressed a question to the Minis-",17
NA,ter for Immigration about Tunica y Casas,17
NA,and his wife. Tunica y Casas was,17
NA,formerly secretary of the Communist,17
NA,"party in New Caledonia, and a contact",17
NA,man for the Communist party in South,17
NA,blast Asia. The Minister stated that they,17
NA,had been given until the end of May to,17
NA,leave Australia. He added that i f they had,17
NA,not left by then they would be deported.,17
NA,"Have they yet left Australia ? I f not, has",17
NA,any order been served on them? Were,17
NA,representations made on their behalf and,17
NA,"if so, by whom ? Has the Minister stayed",17
NA,WIRE. his hand i n this case because Tunica y,17
NA,and his wife are an embarrassment,17
NA,"to their landlords, or is he trying to help",17
NA,their landlords? Have reports been re-,17
NA,ceived about visits paid to these people by,17
NA,native crews of ships that come from New,17
NA,Caledonia and Indo-China? Did the,17
NA,Australian Security Intelligence Organi-,17
NA,zation recommend the deportation?,17
Mr CALWELL , I remember when,17
NA,the honorable member asked me a series,17
NA,"of questions about these people, and I",17
NA,remember the answers I gave. On that,17
NA,"occasion, I stated that these people occu-",17
NA,"pied a building in Ash-street, Sydney.",17
NA,This particular partnership of sandwich,17
NA,suppliers occupied the cellar and the,17
NA,Liberal party occupied the garret. I f,17
NA,members of native crews have been visit-,17
NA,"ing the place, they may have been coming",17
NA,to join the Liberal party. I shall make,17
NA,"inquiries, and answer at a later date the",17
NA,various questions asked by the honorahle,17
NA,member.,17
NA,PASSPORTS.,17
Mr HAMILTON,Ha s the attention,17
NA,of the Minister for Immigration been,17
NA,"drawn to a report that John Brownlee, the",17
NA,"well-known tenor, and his wife were barred",17
NA,by French authorities when they,17
NA,attempted to enter France on a new Aus-,17
NA,"tralian passport, and that they were",17
NA,escorted back to their boat and returned to,17
NA,England the following day? I t is a fact,17
NA,that every person who desires to enter,17
NA,Italy on a new Australian passport is,17
NA,obliged to pay 50s. Australian for a vise,17
NA,"and extra passport photograph, whereas",17
NA,"until the word "" British"" was deleted",17
NA,"from the passport, such persons were",17
NA,admitted free to that country ? Is it a fact,17
NA,that whilst British people have no diffi-,17
NA,"culty in entering Spain, Australians can-",17
NA,not obtain Spanish vises in London ? Will,17
NA,the Minister take appropriate action to,17
NA,end this humiliation of Australians?,17
Mr CALWELL , I take i t that the,18
NA,honorable member can vouch for the,18
NA,accuracy of the statements to which he has,18
NA,referred.,18
Mr HAMILTON ,The y have been pub-,18
NA,lished in newspaper reports.,18
Mr CALWELL ,Tha t is the best of,18
NA,evidence that the statements are entirely,18
NA,incorrect. The report to which the honor-,18
NA,able member has referred is the sort of,18
NA,stupid report upon which the honorable,18
NA,gentleman would base a question. I,18
NA,heard from somebody a few days,18
NA,ago that there had been some com-,18
NA,plaint of the sort that the honor-,18
NA,able member has voiced. The truth of the,18
NA,matter is that Australians experience no,18
NA,difficulty in entering any country pro-,18
NA,vided they make arrangements to obtain,18
NA,"vises. However, Great Britain and a",18
NA,number of European countries have,18
NA,entered into an agreement whereby they,18
NA,mutually agree to discard the use of,18
NA,vis6s. Australia was asked .to become a,18
NA,party to that agreement. Switzerland was,18
NA,one country that asked us to do so.,18
NA,"Certainly, Italy was not a party to any",18
NA,"agreement, because at that particular time",18
NA,the peace treaty in respect of Italy had,18
NA,"not been concluded. Thus, I do not know",18
NA,what Italy's position would be. I ex-,18
NA,plained this matter when it was raised by,18
NA,the honorable member for Parramatta,18
NA,after he returned from a trip abroad. I,18
NA,"then pointed out that for security reasons,",18
NA,"it is not desirable that Australia, which",18
NA,"situated 13,000 miles from Europe, should",18
NA,permit persons to enter this country with-,18
NA,out a proper vise. As we are not prepared,18
NA,to allow other nationals to enter this,18
NA,"country without vises, we cannot expect-",18
NA,other countries to allow entry to our,18
NA,"nationals without vises. However, per-",18
NA,sons who wish to travel would not have,18
NA,the slightest difficulty in obtaining vises,18
NA,if they make proper application to the,18
NA,authorities of the countries they desire to,18
NA,enter before tliey leave Australia or at the,18
NA,diplomatic and consular office of such,18
NA,nations in British countries.,18
Mr MENZIES ,Ar e our passports stilt,18
NA,"marked "" British passport"" ?",18
Mr CALWELL ,The y are marked,18
NA,""" Australian citizen "".",18
Mr MENZIES ,The y used to he marked,18
NA,""" Britisli passport"".",18
Mr CALWELL ,Tha t is so; but,18
NA,under the new nationality law we describe,18
NA,"ourselves as "" Australian citizens "", and",18
NA,Great Britain has altered its passports,18
NA,similarly so ithat residents of Great,18
NA,"Britain are not described now as "" British",18
NA,"subjects "" but are primarily described as",18
NA,""" United Kingdom citizens "". The whole",18
NA,of the alterations are consequent upon the,18
NA,passage of new legislation. The whole,18
NA,of thc issues raised were answered when,18
NA,they were first mentioned by the honor-,18
NA,able member for Parramatta and they,18
NA,were more fully discussed when the,18
NA,Nationality and Citizenship Bill was,18
NA,under discussion. I shall have particular,18
NA,"inquiries made, but I remind the honor-",18
NA,able gentleman that a lot of great artists,18
NA,are like members of the Australian,18
NA,Country party: They are rather,18
NA,temperamental.,18
NA,FREEDOM OF WORSHIP.,18
Mr ADERMANN ,Ha s the Minister,18
NA,for Externa] Affairs seen the statement in,18
NA,which it is reported that the Government,18
NA,of Czechoslovakia is passing legislation to,18
NA,control the church? Has he also seen,18
NA,the statement of the spokesman for that,18
NA,Government that it does not regard,18
NA,religion as a wholly private affair for,18
NA,each individual ? Is this action in accor-,18
NA,dance with the declarations and decisions,18
NA,"of the United Nations? I f not, will Aus-",18
NA,tralia protest against this infringement,18
NA,is of human freedom? I f no action is,18
NA,"taken by the United Nations, for how long",18
NA,are we expected to perpetuate the farce,18
NA,of Russia using the United Nations for,18
NA,its own ends and yet refusing to accept,18
NA,any decision that makes for the better-,18
NA,ment of conditions affecting humanity?,18
Dr EVATT ,I f the honorable mem-,18
NA,ber for Maranoa wishes to criticize the,18
NA,"United Nations, he should not found his",18
NA,"criticism upon one incident of this kind,",18
NA,"to wliicli there is, I think, a complete",18
NA,answer from the point of view of the,18
NA,United Nations. The facts are that in,18
NA,"eastern Europe, first in Hungary, then",18
NA,in Bulgaria and now extending to Czecho-,18
NA,"slovakia and Roumania, the Communist",18
NA,Governments have systematically pre-,18
NA,vented the exercise of religious free-,18
NA,dom. I t is equally true that Aus-,18
NA,tralia took the initiative in bringing,18
NA,these matters to the attention of the,19
NA,General Assembly of the United,19
NA,"Nations. The result was a resolution,",19
NA,in accordance with the treaties of peace,19
NA,made at Paris with those satellites of,19
NA,"Germany, that action should be taken",19
NA,under tliose treaties. The matter is now,19
NA,actually being discussed by the General,19
NA,Assembly. I n addition to the matters,19
NA,"that I have mentioned, the very matter",19
NA,that the honorable member has referred,19
NA,to is also being discussed. The fact is,19
NA,that the United Nations is the only,19
NA,forum in the world where conduct of that,19
NA,kind may be brought to the attention of,19
NA,the world and criticized. I am certain,19
NA,that this is of great value in carrying,19
NA,through the objectives of the United,19
NA,Nations. I do not know whether the,19
NA,honorable gentleman was personally,19
NA,responsible for the sentence of his question,19
NA,"in which he talked about the "" farce "" of",19
NA,the United Nations. I venture to say,19
NA,if that is his opinion,19
Mr ADERMANN ," I ref erred, to Russia",19
NA,making a farce of it.,19
Dr EVATT ,Ther e is no doubt that,19
NA,"every member nation, uses the United",19
NA,"Nations as a forum, including Russia.",19
NA,I t is a part of the procedure of open dis-,19
NA,"cussion, just as, in this House, every",19
NA,honorable member may bring before other,19
NA,honorable members matters in which they,19
NA,are interested. That is not in fact; in-,19
NA,consistent with the idea of a world forum:,19
NA,it is the very nature of it. I f Russia,19
NA,"uses thc United Nations, it gets an answer",19
NA,in kind. The public opinion of the rest,19
NA,of the world turns against conduct which,19
NA,prejudices the practice of all religions,19
NA,in the countries in eastern Europe to,19
NA,which I have referred.,19

NA,the press of .the 5th August that in the,19
NA,"previous six months 5,000 members of",19
NA,the Citizen Military Forees had,19
NA,resigned ? Can the Minister say whether,19
NA,"that is true? I f so, to what does he",19
NA,ascribe those resignations? Can the,19
NA,Minister also say whether the number of,19
NA,troops on strength at that time was only,19
NA,"15,798, although the establishment pro-",19
NA,"vided for a strength of 50,000 troops ?",19
Mr CHAMBERS , I have seen the,19
NA,press statement to which the honorable,19
NA,member has referred. I t is totally in-,19
NA,accurate. The figures were probably com-,19
NA,puted by someone who was trying to write,19
NA,down the Citizen Military Forces training,19
NA,"scheme, which has been in operation for",19
NA,only twelve months. The strength of,19
NA,"50,000 troops is envisaged over a period of",19
NA,five years. I consider that the achieve-,19
NA,"ment of a strength of almost 16,000 troops",19
NA,within a period of little more than twelve,19
NA,months is a very fine effort.,19

NA,misinterrupted from. 12.42 to 12.44^ p.m. and,19

NA,which this bill makes permanent provision,21
NA,are tho adjustment of ranks of members,22
NA,"of the military forces after war service,",22
NA,"which is covered by clause 4, and the",22
NA,"unauthorized use, possession, or supply of",22
NA,uniforms and emblems. Clause 15 will,22
NA,strengthen the existing provisions of,22
NA,section S3 of the Defence Act in relation,22
NA,"to the latter. I n addition, it is proposed",22
NA,to amend section 124 of the Defence Act,22
NA,to enable regulations to be made under,22
NA,that act to deal with the following,22
NA,matters which are now covered by,22
NA,National Security Eegulations:-Th e,22
NA,"suspension, variation, or cancellation of",22
NA,allotments of pay of members of the,22
NA,military forces; the extension of exist-,22
NA,ing powers in the Defence Act to regulate,22
NA,"and control buildings, &c, in defence",22
NA,areas; certification of death and the,22
NA,post-mortem examination and disposal of,22
NA,the bodies of members of the defence,22
NA,forces who die while on service; prisoners,22
NA,of war; command and discipline of bodies,22
NA,"of the Naval, Military or Air Force or",22
NA,any two of those forces acting together;,22
NA,aud provisions relating to the adminis-,22
NA,tration of oaths and the execution of,22
NA,powers of attorney by members of the,22
NA,defence forces.,22
NA,Apart from the provisions of the bill,22
NA,which arise out of National Security,22
NA,"Eegulations, the most important amend-",22
NA,ment proposed _ is that which relates,22
NA,to the composition of the Permanent,22
NA,Military Forces. I n my statement,22
NA,to the Parliament on the 4th June.,22
NA,"J947, on the Government's post-war",22
NA,"defence policy, I said that the army",22
NA,programme provided for the raising,22
NA,"of permanent forces, including a field",22
NA,"force, certain fixed estahlishtaents,",22
NA,"and cadres for instructional, administra-",22
NA,"tive and other duties. These forces, which",22
NA,are known as the Australian Eegular,22
NA,"Army, have been raised under war-time",22
NA,powers in the Defence Act which will,22
NA,cease as soon as a proclamation is issued,22
NA,"terminating the "" Time of War "". Section",22
NA,"31 of the act provides that, except in time",22
NA,"of war, no permanent military forces shall",22
NA,be raised or organized except for adminis-,22
NA,"trative and instructional staffs, including",22
NA,certain specified corps. I t is therefore,22
NA,proposed to repeal the existing section an ',22
NA,to replace it with a section which will,22
NA,give the necessary statutory authority for,22
NA,the Australian Eegular Army.,22
NA,Other provisions to which I invite the,22
NA,attention of honorable members are to,22
NA,"be found in clause 14, which gives statu-",22
NA,tory recognition to the Australian Cadet,22
NA,"Corps, and in clause 19 which regulates",22
NA,the appointment of officers to the Aus-,22
NA,tralian Eegular Army. With the estab-,22
NA,lishment for the first time of an Australian,22
NA,"Eegular Army, it is considered that the",22
NA,-,22
NA,restrictions imposed by the existing sec-,22
NA,"tion 148 of the act are too rigid, and the",22
NA,bill therefore provides such relaxation,22
NA,thereof as is considered necessary. I t is,22
NA,intended that the amending act should,22
NA,"commence on the lst January, 1950, that",22
NA,being the date up to which the continuance,22
NA,of National Security Eegulations is,22
NA,authorized by the Defence (Transitional,22
NA,Provisions) Act 1948. Provision is made,22
NA,in clause 20 of the bill for the continuance,22
NA,"in force, under the Defence Act, of the",22
NA,National Security Eegulations specified,22
NA,in that clause. These will be amended or,22
NA,repealed as soon as it is practicable to,22
NA,prepare and gazette new regulations under,22
NA,the Defence Act as now proposed to be,22
NA,amended. I commend the bill to honor-,22
NA,able members.,22

Mr RIORDAN ,Kennedy-Ministe r,22
NA,for the Navy) [11.31] -b y leave- I,22
NA,move-,22
NA,That the bill be now read a second time.,22
NA,This bill for an act to amend the Naval,22
NA,"Defence Act 1910-1948, was referred to",22
NA,by the Minister for Defence ( Mr.,22
NA,Dedman) a few moments ago when he,22
NA,introduced the bill to amend the Defence,22
NA,"Act 1903-1948, and, like most of the pro-",22
NA,"visions of that measure, its purpose is to",22
NA,obviate the necessity for a further ex-,22
NA,tension of certain sections of the,22
NA,Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act,22
NA,"1948. As a consequence, the National",22
NA,Security (Naval Forces) Eegulations and,22
NA,the National Security (Naval Charter,22
NA,"Eates) Eegulations, which will cease to be",23
NA,"effective after the end of 1949, will not",23
NA,be further extended. I t is desired to,23
NA,have the necessary provision to enable,23
NA,the services of certain senior commissioned,23
NA,officers and commissioned officers who,23
NA,received their appointments by virtue of,23
NA,the National Security (Naval Forces),23
NA,"Eegulations to be continued. Normally,",23
NA,those officers would not be eligible for,23
NA,"employment, being over the prescribed",23
NA,"age, or lacking some other qualification.",23
NA,"HoAvever, owing to the acute shortage of",23
NA,"officers in the Eoyal Australian Navy, if",23
NA,is essential that the services of the tem-,23
NA,porary officers be retained whilst new,23
NA,appointees are entered and trained. The,23
NA,efficiency of the Navy would be seriously,23
NA,affected should it become necessary to,23
NA,dispense with the services of temporary,23
NA,officers before i t became possible to,23
NA,replace them. I point out that,23
NA,"tbey are all volunteers for further service,",23
NA,and that none is being retained against his,23
NA,will.,23
NA,"Under the approved naval programme,",23
NA,many more permanent officers will be,23
NA,required than was the case in pre-war,23
NA,days. Every effort to obtain those,23
NA,"officers is being explored, but it is not",23
NA,expected that the existing shortage wili,23
NA,be overtaken for a number of years. The,23
NA,bill also gives power to the Governor-,23
NA,General to make regulations for the fixing,23
NA,of eharter rates and establishment charges,23
NA,in respect of ships requisitioned for naval,23
NA,purposes. This will allow the making of,23
NA,regulations under the Naval Defence Act,23
NA,to replace the National Security (Naval,23
NA,Charter Eates) Eegulations. Whilst,23
NA,most vessels requisitioned during the war,23
NA,have since been returned to their owner3,23
NA,"or have been otherwise disposed of, there",23
NA,"are a few still under charter, and it is",23
NA,necessary to continue a charter rates,23
NA,board. The board is the authority for,23
NA,fixing charter rates and establishment,23
NA,charges in respect of requisitioned vessels.,23
NA,"Owing to changing conditions, charter",23
NA,"rates are altered from time to time, and",23
NA,it is therefore necessary for the Charter,23
NA,Eates Board to be in a position to func-,23
NA,tion while vessels are still under requisi-,23
NA,tion. It is unlikely that the last of the,23
NA,vessels will be derequisitioned before the,23
NA,end of 1950 at the earliest. I commend,23
NA,the bill to the House.,23

Mr HUGHES ,North Sydney) [11.36].,23
NA,- I wish to say a few words about a,23
NA,matter that concerns us very closely. I,23
NA,commend the Minister for Immigration,23
NA,( Mr Calwell) for his immigration policy.,23
NA,"As usual, of course, he has not hidden his",23
NA,"light under a bushel. From time to time,",23
NA,he has told us exactly what progress he,23
NA,has been making; but let us consider the,23
NA,figures. The Minister would have us,23
NA,believe that he is responsible for a flow,23
NA,of immigrants to this country at a rate,23
NA,which is without parallel in our history.,23
NA,"For everything that he has done, and is",23
NA,doing to bring to this country immi-,23
NA,grants who can be absorbed into the,23
NA,"body politic, he is deserving of",23
NA,"commendation, but I point out to him",23
NA,"and to the country, that the results",23
NA,achieved so far are not satisfactory.,23
NA,Immigration to Australia throughout our,23
NA,history has ebbed and flowed. At,23
NA,times the stream of migrants has,23
NA,"swelled to a rushing torrent, and at other",23
NA,times it has shrunk to a mere trickle.,23
NA,"On occasions, the stream has dried up.",23
NA,"During the period 1910-14, long before",23
NA,Australia had the advantage of the efforts,23
NA,"oi the present Minister, immigra-",24
NA,tion attained proportions that have,24
NA,not been equalled since. During,24
NA,that quinquennial period no fewer than,24
NA,"048,512 migrants came to this country.",24
NA,"The average rate of entry was 129,702",24
NA,migrants a year. During the period,24
NA,"1946-48, when the honorable gentleman's",24
NA,"scheme was in operation, 218,381",24
NA,migrants entered this country. The,24
NA,"average was 72,000 migrants a year. When",24
NA,we consider that the population of Aus-,24
NA,tralia during the years 1910 to 1914,24
NA,"averaged 4,940,000 and that to-day it is,",24
NA,according to the latest figures that are,24
NA,"availahle, 7,794,000, we see very",24
NA,clearly that the results of the hon-,24
NA,"orable gentleman's scheme, notwith-",24
NA,standing the advantages that i t has,24
NA,"derived from his association with it,",24
NA,have proved to be distinctly disappoint-,24
NA,ing. Between 1910 and 1914 Aus-,24
NA,"tralia gained 648,512 persons, or slightly",24
NA,over one-eighth of the population at that,24
NA,time. One-eighth of the present popula-,24
NA,"tion is 974,360 persons, but the actual",24
NA,gain that has heen made under the Minis-,24
NA,"ter's scheme is approximately 218,000",24
NA,"persons. After the first World War,",24
NA,between 1919 and 1921 there was a net,24
NA,"gain of 211,333 persons. Between 1946",24
NA,"and 1948 the net gain was 65,000 persons.",24
NA,I f the excess of departures over arrivals,24
NA,"in 1946 is deducted, the figure is 50,570.",24
NA,"That is an average of 16,000 a year as",24
NA,"against an average of 70,000 a year",24
NA,"between 1919 and 1921. As I have said,",24
NA,I commend the Minister for his efforts,24
NA,to bring the right kind of people to this,24
NA,"country, but I say to him that he ought",24
NA,not to grow weary with well doing.,24
NA,I have read with great interest a,24
NA,brochure entitled Policy and Progress,24
NA,that the Minister has made available to,24
NA,me. I t is chiefly remarkable for the,24
NA,admirable photograph of himself that,24
NA,appears on the first page. I admit that,24
NA,he has enormous advantages over me in,24
NA,"that respect. Candidly, I hand him the",24
NA,bun in tiiat connexion. When I read th<»,24
NA,"brochure, which I did as part of my duty",24
NA,"as a member of the Parliament, I found",24
NA,that the photograph was much the,24
NA,best part of it. But although migra-,24
NA,"tion is a most important factor, it",24
NA,has always played a subsidiary part,24
NA,thc growth of population of this,24
NA,country. For over a century of our,24
NA,history it has borne the same relation to,24
NA,the growth of our population by natural,24
NA,increase as one bears to three. I am sure,24
NA,"that the Minister has noticed, because",24
NA,"few things escape his notice, that in days",24
NA,gone by the birth-rate in Australia which,24
NA,"was, with the possible exception of New",24
NA,"Zealand, the highest of any country in",24
NA,the English-speaking world had fallen,24
NA,to a dangerously low level. Lately it has,24
NA,"taken an upward trend. Eor that, many",24
NA,thanks. I am not endeavouring now to,24
NA,deal with the birth-rate in detail. I,24
NA,am merely pointing out to the Minis-,24
NA,"ter that migration cannot, of itself,",24
NA,solve the problem. I am thoroughly,24
NA,alive to the point that although the,24
NA,"birth-rate may swell our numbers, for",24
NA,a generation it will be unable to,24
NA,provide us with more people who are,24
NA,capable of co-operating i n the develop-,24
NA,"ment of our resources and, i f need be, in",24
NA,the defence of this country. I remind the,24
NA,"Minister that included in the 218,000",24
NA,people who were brought to this country,24
NA,"between 1946 and 1948, were a great many",24
NA,"children. That remark applies, of course,",24
NA,to the migrants who were brought to this,24
NA,country before World War II . I t is,24
NA,inevitable that the kind of people that we,24
NA,want will he people who bring children,24
NA,with them. The point I am endeavouring,24
NA,to make is that the situation in which Aus-,24
NA,tralia finds itself to-day is one that ought,24
NA,to cause every one of us great concern.,24
NA,"Aft-ithe first World War, the world had",24
NA,no experience of the effects of great con-,24
NA,flicts. The victory had been won although,24
NA,"at a great price. The fighting forces, of",24
NA,"course, suffered enormously more casual-",24
NA,ties than they did during the war of,24
NA,"1939-45, although civilian casualties wero",24
NA,much less. I was a delegate to the Inter-,24
NA,"national Peace Conference, and the mem-",24
NA,bers of that conference believed that the,24
NA,world had before it then an unbroken vista,24
NA,"of peace, and that it might confidently",24
NA,look to the League of Nations to iron out,24
NA,the differences and settle disputes between,24
NA,the nations that had formerly led to war.,24
NA,Our subsequent bitter experence taught,24
NA,"us, however, that although the League of",24
NA,Nations was theoretically capable of pre-,24
NA,"venting war, practically i t proved a",24
NA,broken reed. Now we are confronted,24
NA,with a situation that is incomparably,24
NA,more menacing than that presented to,25
NA,us after World War I. Because no one,25
NA,"can predict the future, I speak with some",25
NA,"hesitation in this matter, but it cannot",25
NA,be denied that our present position must,25
NA,give us great concern. I point out to,25
NA,"the Minister that ""UNO"", the United",25
NA,"Nations orgiiiiization, is simply another",25
NA,"name for the "" League of Nations"",",25
NA,and that where the League of Nations,25
NA,failed the United Nations cann,25
NA,hope to succeed. We have all,25
NA,been impressed by the contributions,25
NA,made by the Attorney-General,25
NA,Evatt) to entertain mankind with his,25
NA,"injunctions to "" Leave everything to",25
NA,United Nations organization. It can and,25
NA,"will prevent another world war "". What",25
NA,has the United Nations done? What is,25
NA,it doing now? It is at once the most,25
NA,garrulous and futile of human insti-,25
NA,"tutions. Its members make speeches,",25
NA,but action is outside their,25
NA,"This morning we have hepn fc""!' 1",25
NA,more of what it is doing. The fact,25
NA,remains that Russia takes no notice,25
NA,whatever of the United Nations. Russia,25
NA,knows perfectly well that the United Na-,25
NA,"tions is impotent. I am not, of course,",25
NA,accusing the Minister for Immigration of,25
NA,worshipping at that shrine. I am merely,25
NA,pointing out that Australia is at once the,25
NA,most inviting and the most vulnerable,25
NA,country in the world. War may he,25
NA,averted because Russia is not yet ready,25
NA,to assault the world by armed force. One,25
NA,"thing, however, cannot be averted, and to",25
NA,that I direct the attention of the Parlia-,25
NA,ment and of the country: the world's,25
NA,"population is increasing unevenly, and at",25
NA,c great pace. Australians are the heirs to,25
NA,"and trustees of this vast island continent,",25
NA,"vvhich, although it contains a great area",25
NA,"of barren waste, can absorb tens of",25
NA,"millions of people, as the Minister has",25
NA,himself very properly pointed out. With,25
NA,"others, I believe that the potentialities",25
NA,of this country have not yet been even,25
NA,"envisaged. In the fullness of time, Aus-",25
NA,tralia must hold tens of millions of,25
NA,"Time works great changes. Japan,",25
NA,vvhich was our ally during World,25
NA,"War I., was our enemy during the recent",25
NA,"war, and came within an ace of over-",25
NA,"whelming us. Indeed, but for the United",25
NA,"States of America, the Japanese would",25
NA,have overwhelmed us. Previously we were,25
NA,Mr Hughes.,25
NA,"shrouded in remote distance, and lay",25
NA,securely sheltered under the broad wing,25
NA,of the Royal Navy until the outbreak of,25
NA,World War II . The British Navy is no,25
NA,"longer mistress of the seas, and sea-power",25
NA,itself has declined to a secondary place,25
NA,in defence. During the recent war Japan,25
NA,"although defeated, suffered little material",25
NA,damage. The bombs that fell on Hiro-,25
NA,shima and Nagasaki inflicted compara-,25
NA,-. tively few casualties. The present popu-,25
NA,lation of Japan is the greatest on record,25
NA,and is increasing at the rate of over,25
NA,"(Dr 1,000,000 people a year. I remind",25
NA,honorable members that Japan occupies,25
NA,an area only one-twenty-fifth of Aus-,25
NA,"tralia whose population of 8,000,000 is",25
NA,increasing all too slowly-an d here I come,25
NA,lo the point from which I set out. Whilst,25
NA,"war may be averted, the danger that",25
NA,arises from the uneven distribution of,25
NA,"population, and particularly from the",25
NA,ambit. tremendous increase of population ih,25
NA,"the densely congested nations of the east,",25
NA,must inevitably create a situation full of,25
NA,menace to this country. The present,25
NA,"population of Japan is 80,000,000, and",25
NA,"is, as I have said, increasing at the rate",25
NA,"of over 1,000,000 annually. I t has now",25
NA,reached saturation point. Japan can,25
NA,hold no more because she can feed no,25
NA,"more, but still the increase of population",25
NA,continues. Where are those surplus,25
NA,millions to go? Where can they find a,25
NA,country at once so inviting and so,25
NA,vulnerable as Australia? What armed,25
NA,forces have we that can stop them?,25
NA,I t may 'be that the Japanese will,25
NA,"not come with arms in their hands, 'but",25
NA,will knock at the door of the United,25
NA,"Nations, demanding a place in the sun",25
NA,and an opportunity to build homes in,25
NA,our country. Since the Japanese are,25
NA,"human beings, what can the United",25
NA,Nations say? They have the right,25
NA,to live. That body will deal out,25
NA,even-handed justice. I t can afford,25
NA,to regard this matter from a detached,25
NA,point of view. Fifty-four nations are,25
NA,"people. represented in that body, but only",25
NA,four or five of them are able to strike,25
NA,"an effective blow for anything, including",25
NA,their own defence. But they may decide,25
NA,"our fate. However, i f the Japanese",25
NA,"come with arms in their hands, we can-",25
NA,not stop them. The days of isolation,25
NA,are gone. We have to play our part,25
NA,"in the full spotlight of the world,",26
NA,which is looking on. The world will,26
NA,"say: "" Here is a people who will neither",26
NA,populate their country nor allow others,26
NA,"to do so "". 1 have not the time nor the",26
NA,opportunity now to discuss our White,26
NA,Australia policy; i t is enough for me to,26
NA,"say, "" I am for a White Australia",26
NA,"policy "".",26
NA,M'r. CALWELL -Bu t,26
Mr HUGHES , I know that the of,26
NA,Minister supports the White Australia incident with eastern countries and their,26

NA,thought that his criticisms were very good.,26
NA,"Indeed, I could have said those things",26
NA,"myself. But a day or so later, when",26
NA,"he is tackled in this chamber, he says",26
NA,that he will not prevent Australian Com-,26
NA,munists from going to Moscow. He claims,26
NA,that they have the right to be given a pass-,26
NA,"port, and that he will grant them pass-",26
NA,ports. The Communists are emissaries of,26
NA,"Satan, and the Minister sends them out",26
NA,to do Satan's work.,26
Mr CALWELL ,Wh y did the right,26
NA,honorable gentleman try to bribe them,26
NA,with government money?,26
Mr HUGHES ,"Oh , go on!",26
NA,The DEPUTY CHAIBM AN ( Mr.,26
NA,Burke) -Order ! The right honorable,26
NA,member for North Sydney is being led Australia,26
NA,away from the subject of immigration.,26
Mr HUGHES ,Immigratio n is inex-,26
NA,plicably linked with the defence of,26
NA,"tralia, and the maintenance of the kind of policy.",26
NA,Australia that we have to-day. I remind,26
NA,the Minister that Australia embodied the,26
NA,principle of White Australia in the,26
NA,"Immigration Bestriction Act, which was",26
NA,"passed in 1901, and for nearly half a",26
NA,century that legislation worked so effec-,26
NA,tively and smoothly that when he came,26
NA,"upon the scene, he found an Australia as",26
NA,""" white "" in 1945 as i t was in 1901.",26
Mr CALWELL ,No .,26
Mr HUGHES ,"Wha t is more, the",26
NA,Minister found that the legislation had,26
NA,"worked so smoothly that, during the whole",26
NA,"that period, there had not been one",26
NA,(,26
NA,Nearly every country in the,26
NA,world protests almost daily against the,26
NA,has manner in which this policy is being,26
Mr CALWELL ,"I t is the same policy,",26
Mr HUGHES ,Al l that the honor-,26
NA,able gentleman does is to shut out Mrs.,26
NA,"Annie O'Keefe, or Mrs Somebody Else.",26
Mr CALWELL ,Perhap s Mr Hughes.,26
Mr HUGHES ,Th e Minister may,26
NA,"nofc realize that for many years, I was",26
NA,"in control of immigration, and I did not",26
NA,with bother about what Mrs So-and-So did,26
NA,or did not do.,26
Mr CALWELL ,O f course not!,26
Mr HUGHES ,Afte r nearly 50 years,26
NA,Australia was as white as i t was on the,26
NA,day on which the act was passed. We,26
NA,were not involved in incidents with,26
NA,"foreign countries. India, China and",26
NA,Japan made no complaint to us about the,26
NA,manner in which we were administering,26
NA,the law. We got on smoothly with them.,26
Mr CALWELL ,N o country has ever,26
NA,complained to the Commonwealth about,26
NA,the administration of the immigration,26
NA,law.,26
Mr FRANCIS ,Wha t about the Philip-,26
NA,pines ?,26
Mr CALWELL ,Th e Philippines have,26
NA,never complained.,26
Mr HUGHES ,Th e proof of the,26
NA,"pudding is in the eating. After 45 years,",26
NA,"was as "" white "" as it was on the",26
NA,day the act was passed.,26
Mr CALWELL ,An d that is when the,26
NA,Ausright honorable gentleman deserted the,26
Mr HUGHES ,Oh ! For some in-,26
NA,"scrutable reason, the Minister has been",26
NA,permitted by providence to intrude into,26
NA,"this sphere, and somehow, he is like the",27
NA,"fly on the wheel. The wheel is turning,",27
NA,"and the fly says, "" I am turning i t "" .",27
NA,But that is not the position. I heard the,27
NA,Minister for Post-war Reconstruction,27
NA,( Mr Dedman) speak about our defences.,27
NA,"Taking him all in all, I hope that we",27
NA,shall never see his like again.,27
Mr CALWELL ,H e will be here for a,27
NA,long time yet.,27
Mr HUGHES , I do not know,27
NA,"whether he will or not, just as I do not",27
NA,know whether or not the Minister will he,27
NA,here for a long time.,27
Mr CALWELL ,W e shall outlive the,27
NA,right honorable gentleman here.,27
NA,"The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN"" -Order !",27
NA,There are too many interjections.,27
Mr HUGHES , I should miss the,27
NA,honorable gentleman i f he were not here.,27
NA,The point that I desire to make is that,27
NA,we are in no position to defend this,27
NA,"country. Indeed, we have never been in a",27
NA,position to defend this country from,27
NA,aggression by a major power. Had it,27
NA,not been for the efforts of the United,27
NA,"States of America in World War II . ,",27
NA,we should have been undone; and had,27
NA,Japan been permitted to settle its,27
NA,"nationals in New Guinea, we should have",27
NA,been undone anyhow. War may be,27
NA,"averted, but there is danger i n the",27
NA,congested populations of the eastern,27
NA,countries in particular. For those surplus,27
NA,"millions, there is no escape from death by",27
NA,starvation save by migration. They must,27
NA,"find a way out, and I ask again where",27
NA,can they go but to Australia? What,27
NA,do we intend to do to prevent them?,27
NA,Without powerful friends we cannot hope,27
NA,to defend the country against them.,27
NA,We must populate and develop this,27
NA,"country, and so order ourselves that",27
NA,"the world will say, "" The Australians are",27
NA,a people worthy of their freedom and of,27
NA,the right to the unfettered control of this,27
NA,"great country, because they are carrying",27
NA,"on as civilized people"". Every nation",27
NA,has the right to say who shall come in,27
NA,"and who shall not come in, but a well-",27
NA,"bred, civilized people do not slam the",27
NA,"in the face of migrants, and let it be",27
NA,seen that they think that they are,27
NA,superior to the nationals of other coun-,27
NA,tries. We are now to play our part under,27
NA,the spotlight on the world stage before,27
NA,"nations of the world. Therefore, we must",27
NA,"ensure that we shall be able, first to",27
NA,defend this country to the best of our,27
NA,"ability, and, secondly, to develop its",27
NA,resources and absorb assimilable people.,27
NA,"The Minister is trying to do that, and I",27
NA,commend him for it.,27
NA,I now desire to make another point. I f,27
NA,we are to hold this country we must,27
NA,populate and defend it. We must look to,27
NA,our defence forces. I ' believe in the,27
NA,principle of a free people governing them-,27
NA,selves. We in this country have attained,27
NA,the widest measure of freedom of any,27
NA,people in the world. We enjoy our,27
NA,"democratic parliamentary, institutions,",27
NA,"although mark you, they are threatened",27
NA,by the Labour party.,27
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ,Order !,27
NA,The right honorable gentleman's time has,27
NA,expired.,27
Mr HAYLEN ,Parkes) [12.8] -Th e,27
NA,right honorable member for North,27
NA,Sydney ( Mr Hughes) is worth listening,27
NA,"to on the subject of migration. I n fact,",27
NA,"I listened to him with bated breath,",27
NA,because I suppose that he is the most,27
NA,spectacular British migrant that we have,27
NA,ever had in this country; but his in-,27
NA,cursions into the field of migration,27
NA,during thie debate were extremely limited.,27
NA,He yielded to his well-known political,27
NA,cunning to traverse such subjects as the,27
NA,"birth-rate, the defence of Australia, the",27
NA,"United Nations, the White Australia",27
NA,"policy and population trends, the develop-",27
NA,"ment of the inland, the future of New",27
NA,"Guinea, the possibility of another inva-",27
NA,"sion, and communism.",27
Mr WHITE ,Al l of those are asso-,27
NA,ciated subjects.,27
Mr HAYLEN ,The y all are asso-,27
NA,ciated subjects. I pay a tribute to the,27
NA,right honorable gentleman for having-,27
NA,"made the hest use of his time, and, i f as he",27
NA,"said, the sea is dotted with craft which-",27
NA,are bringing British migrants to Aus-,27
NA,"tralia, who knows but that there may be-",27
NA,on the bounding ocean other right honor-,27
NA,door able members for North Sydney who will,27
NA,give us the benefit of their services in time,27
NA,to come. That appears to he the best,27
NA,"answer, the unpolitical answer, to any",27
NA,criticism of the immigration scheme. To-,27
NA,the refer back to the period from 1910 to,27
NA,"1914 and attempt to prove, by a group of""",27
NA,"figures unrelated to any other period,",28
NA,that that was the era of the high tide in,28
NA,"the golden age of immigration and that,",28
NA,"comparatively speaking, there is only a",28
NA,"trickle of immigrants to-day, is of no",28
NA,avail. I f we accept the period from 1910,28
NA,to 1914 for the purposes of comparison,28
NA,"with the present, we must also take into",28
NA,consideration factors that were not men-,28
NA,tioned hy the right honorable member for,28
NA,North Sydney. Immigrants in those days,28
NA,were put on ships at the expense of either,28
NA,the Australian Government or the Tjnited,28
NA,Kingdom Government and were tumbled,28
NA,"out on the wharfs of Sydney, Melbourne,",28
NA,"Adelaide, Fremantle and other ports and",28
NA,left to fend for themselves. The result of,28
NA,"that policy was that, as the swelling tide",28
NA,had poured on to the wharfs and landing,28
NA,"stages, so eventually many of the immi-",28
NA,grants flooded the social welfare camps,28
NA,during the depression.,28
NA,Any man who did any social work dur-,28
NA,ing the depression will realize that the,28
NA,"poor little immigrant, who had been badly",28
NA,selected in the first place without any,28
NA,"aptitude tests or anything of that sort, was",28
NA,"the first one to go into our "" Happy",28
NA,"Valleys"" and other such centres, where",28
NA,"he was given the dole, some clothing and",28
NA,the lowest level of comfort. There can,28
NA,be no proper comparison 'between,28
NA,the two schemes in terms of numbers,28
NA,alone. Humanitarian treatment must,28
NA,be taken into account as well. Other-,28
NA,"wise, the comparison is too remote",28
NA,"even to be considered. I n 1914,",28
NA,immigration was looked upon by the,28
NA,idealists as a means of increasing our,28
NA,population and developing the country,28
NA,for its eventual preservation and progress.,28
NA,I t was also looked upon by others calmly,28
NA,"and coldly, with the business-like eye of",28
NA,the man looking for cheap labour in order,28
NA,to break down workers' standards and,28
NA,destroy unionism. That made an ugly,28
NA,story. To-day we accept immigration as,28
NA,a subject above politics. I have always,28
NA,"considered that repatriation, immigra-",28
NA,"tion, and two or three other subjects",28
NA,"should be lifted above the level of politics,",28
NA,"though not, of course, exempted from",28
NA,"political discussion. Unfortunately, the",28
NA,tributes that are paid to the Minister,28
NA,for Immigration ( Mr Calwell) by,28
NA,honorable members opposite are of,28
NA,"a ""yes hut- "" character.",28
NA,body admits that the honorable gentle-,28
NA,n-an has done a splendid job in the,28
NA,"face of competition from other countries,",28
NA,"notably South Africa, New Zealand, and",28
NA,various .South American States. Yet,28
NA,"honorable members opposite say, "" Yes,",28
NA,"he has done a good job, but he has failed",28
NA,"to do this or that"".",28
NA,They link the arrival of immigrants,28
NA,with the White Australia policy and,28
NA,declare that the Minister has not handled,28
NA,that policy effectively. I consider that,28
NA,his outlook upon both immigration and,28
NA,the White Australia policy has been ex-,28
NA,ceptionally broad and statesmanlike.,28
NA,"Despite criticism from various sources, he",28
NA,has proved himself to be a great Aus-,28
NA,"tralian in these matters. When, our pre-",28
NA,sent immigration scheme was commenced,28
NA,"in 1945, our chances of obtaining new",28
NA,citizens from a bruised and broken,28
NA,Europe and from an England engrossed,28
NA,in the problems of reconstruction,28
NA,appeared to be almost hopeless. There,28
NA,is no royal road to success with immigra-,28
NA,tion. We cannot wait until we have,28
NA,empty houses and everything else in,28
NA,"readiness for immigrants. Nevertheless,",28
NA,the only thing that has been lacking has,28
NA,been adequate accommodation. Courage,28
NA,and statesmanship have enabled us to,28
NA,go ahead and to use the services of new,28
NA,arrivals in providing the things that we,28
NA,lack. Prospective immigrants are frankly,28
NA,told the truth about conditions in Aus-,28
NA,tralia. The story of this immigration,28
NA,scheme is one of the post-war epics. The,28
NA,project has been carried out efficiently,28
NA,and magnificently in spite of failures,28
NA,that have occurred elsewhere and in spite,28
NA,of the reluctance of people in Europe to,28
NA,undertake the long trek to Australia.,28
NA,We have overcome indecisions and the,28
NA,doubts of trade unions in Great Britain,28
NA,about mass immigration. Immigrant,28
NA,ships are leaving for Australia in increas-,28
NA,"ing numbers, and the estimated net",28
NA,immigration figure for this year is,28
NA,"148,000. I n view of the shortages that",28
NA,"were caused by six years of war, that",28
NA,figure represents a magnificent achieve-,28
NA,ment.,28
NA,The difficulties involved in the immi-,28
NA,gration scheme are not confined to those of,28
NA,"Everytransporting people to Australia, but",28
NA,most of them have been satisfactorily,28
NA,overcome. As the right honorable mem-,29
NA,"ber for Worth Sydney has said, we must",29
NA,anticipate certain new .problems. For,29
NA,"instance, the migration of people under",29
NA,the auspices of the International,29
NA,Eelief Organization will eventu-,29
NA,ally cease. From what other source will,29
NA,we be able to obtain migrants? Some,29
NA,"people suggest Germany, Scandinavia,",29
NA,and Norway. There are many reasons,29
NA,why it will be difficult to persuade people,29
NA,to come to Australia from those countries.,29
NA,"Therefore, we shall be obliged to turn",29
NA,to the surplus population of Great,29
NA,Britain. One of the really difficult,29
NA,decisions that must be made relates to,29
NA,the number of British migrants that will,29
NA,come to Australia. I predict that the,29
NA,numbers will grow and that the propor-,29
NA,tion of British immigrants to other Euro-,29
NA,pean immigrants will become considerably,29
NA,higher during the next ten years than it,29
NA,is now. That will be all to our advantage.,29
NA,The Australian attitude towards the,29
NA,nomination of British immigrants poses,29
NA,an administrative problem of which the,29
NA,Minister is well aware. The nomination,29
NA,"of an immigrant, imposes a sacred duty.",29
NA,The nominator takes upon himself and,29
NA,his family the responsibility of provid-,29
NA,ing for the accommodation of an immi-,29
NA,grant or a number of immigrants without,29
NA,affecting the housing of native-born,29
NA,Australians. .Should the nomination,29
NA,"system break down, as the result of",29
NA,insincerity on the part of nominators or,29
NA,"nominees, bad feeling would be created",29
NA,and the scheme would be seriously,29
NA,"prejudiced. At present, the nomination",29
NA,system is at the top of the news and is,29
NA,being treated idealistically. Ex-servicebring,29
NA,men's organizations are sponsoring ship-,29
NA,loads of British immigrants. The first,29
NA,sponsored ship to reach our shores was,29
NA,"Somersetshire, which I met in Sydney",29
NA,on behalf of the Minister for Immigra-,29
NA,tion. I was particularly impressed by,29
NA,the good type of ex-serviceman that the,29
NA,Returned Sailors Soldiers and Airmen's,29
NA,Imperial League of Australia is bringing,29
NA,to Australia. At the back of my mind,29
NA,is the fear that Australians will not stand,29
NA,up rigidly to their responsibilities as,29
NA,nominators. It will not be sufficient for,29
NA,a nominator merely to bring an English,29
NA,"immigrant into his home, bed him down",29
NA,for a few weeks until he becomes,29
NA,Mr Haylen.,29
NA,accustomed to his new surroundings and,29
NA,then tell him to try to find accommoda-,29
NA,tion for himself. I f we want to make,29
NA,"Australia a greater, economically stronger",29
NA,and more progressive part of the,29
NA,"Empire than it is now, Great Britain",29
NA,will supply the people that we need.,29
NA,I t will be up to us to provide those people,29
NA,"with an assurance of security of tenure,",29
NA,and we can do that only i f we adhere,29
NA,strictly to the nomination system. I t,29
NA,is only fair to insist that the native Aus-,29
NA,tralian shall have preference in obtain-,29
NA,"ing housing accommodation, and the Go-",29
NA,vernment has done so. I f new arrivals,29
NA,seek to break away from the nomination,29
NA,system and obtain houses which should,29
NA,"be occupied by Australians, the system",29
NA,will break down. Then the Minister will,29
NA,face further problems. I f the nomination,29
NA,"system fails, he will have to decide",29
NA,what kind of immigrants hc will bring,29
NA,to Australia from Europe and what pro-,29
NA,portion of new arrivals will be admitted,29
NA,from Great Britain. Those are the only,29
NA,potential flaws in the present scheme.,29
NA,The right honorable member for North,29
NA,Sydney related the subject of immigra-,29
NA,tion to the population tension i n the,29
NA,"East, to the United Nations policy in",29
NA,relation to the open door for coloured,29
NA,"peoples, and to other subjects that have",29
NA,been discussed in Australia for more than,29
NA,50 years. Neither the Minister for,29
NA,Immigration nor the Government as a,29
NA,whole has suggested that the immigra-,29
NA,tion scheme provides the answer to our,29
NA,low birth-rate. Immigration is only a,29
NA,"supplementary measure. However, it will",29
NA,many useful citizens to our shores.,29
NA,"Up to date, the department has touched",29
NA,only the fringe of the potential field of,29
NA,recruitment. When the difficulties of,29
NA,"transport are lessened, when Europe haa",29
NA,"settled down, and when we can find ont",29
NA,exactly how many men and women are,29
NA,"willing to come to Australia, great things",29
NA,can be done. Without being mealy-,29
NA,"mouthed, we can pay a glowing tribute",29
NA,to the Minister for having done great,29
NA,"work for our country. At the same time,",29
NA,he has done a great deal to ease the,29
NA,tensions of population and reconstruction,29
NA,difficulties that have caused a great deal,29
NA,of disturbance in Great Britain. Com-,29
NA,parisons with the past or speculations,29
NA,about tbe future are futile. The Governbeliefs,30
NA,"ment's migration scheme is based, not on",30
NA,"numbers, but on humanity. Immigrants,",30
NA,"upon their arrival in Australia, are",30
NA,"left to fend for themselves, so that the",30
NA,weaker will go to the wall and the zation,30
NA,stronger succeed. That policy might,30
NA,"have been accepted in the 'nineties, but",30
NA,the people of Australia to-day would,30
NA,stand for it. Our immigration policy,30
NA,"geared to humanitarianism, and i t is",30
NA,being applied efficiently.,30
NA,There is a matter touching the adminisated,30
NA,tration of the Department of Immigraand,30
NA,"tion to which I , in justice to certain",30
NA,"sons outside the Parliament, should refer.",30
NA,"Eecently, the Minister appointed, with",30
NA,my congratulations and those of many,30
NA,other Australians both inside and outside,30
NA,"the , Parliament, a planning committee",30
NA,tc. arrange accommodation and employbeen,30
NA,ment for immigrants. I t was decided to,30
NA,utilize for this purpose some of the best,30
NA,"business brains in Australia, and I pay",30
NA,a tribute to those who have co-operated,30
NA,"so willingly. However, some newspapers",30
NA,took it for granted that the Immigration,30
NA,"Advisory Council, of which I am chairthe",30
NA,"man, had been disbanded. The honortical",30
NA,a'ble member for Eeid ( Mr Lang) writMinister,30
NA,"ing in the Century, that little journal",30
NA,which he produces for his own amusego,30
NA,ment--becaus e it has no circulation and,30
NA,"no prestige-announce d that the chaircountry,",30
NA,man of the Immigration Advisory Counoperate,30
NA,cil had been sacked. Perhaps he felt,30
NA,"that, as the leading figure in one of the",30
NA,greatest sacking incidents in the history,30
NA,"of Australia, when he was sacked from",30
NA,his job as Premier of New South Wales,30
NA,"one bright, summer morning by the",30
NA,"Governor of that State, he was qualified",30
NA,to offer an opinion on the subject,30
NA,sacking. His comments are immaterial,30
NA,to me except insofar as they affect other,30
NA,"memlbers of the council, which includes",30
NA,"business men in Melbourne, Canberra,",30
NA,"and Sydney, and representatives of",30
NA,organizations of ex-servicemen.,30
NA,council consists of a group of persons,30
NA,with an instinct for planning and organiter's,30
NA,"zation, who were gathered together to",30
NA,assist our immigration policy when it,30
NA,was first put into operation. I t would,30
NA,o,30
NA,be callous on my part not to make it clear,30
NA,that they have done a magnificent job.,30
NA,Although' many of them hold political,30
NA,"the opposite of my own, they have",30
NA,been completely loyal and tireless in their,30
NA,efforts to make the immigration policy,30
NA,not work. I have in mind particularly Mr.,30
NA,"Oberg, who, being president of an organi-",30
NA,of employers is not of my political,30
NA,kidney. No one could have received,30
NA,more loyal support or co-operation than,30
NA,not I did from him when we were investi-,30
NA,is gating migration problems in the United,30
NA,Kingdom and continental Europe. I also,30
NA,NA,30
NA,"Wilkins, former secretary of the Associ-",30
NA,"Chambers of Commerce of Australia,",30
NA,"Mr L. Withall, secretary of the Asso-",30
NA,perciated Chambers of Manufactures of,30
NA,Australia. There are also on the com-,30
NA,mittee members of the armed services,30
NA,who had grave problems to consider in,30
NA,connexion with. the admission of ex-,30
NA,enemies. Although their feelings had,30
NA,bruised by their war-time contacts,30
NA,"with ex-enemy nationals, they did a mag-",30
NA,nificent job as members of the Immigra-,30
NA,tion Advisory Council. I t i l l becomes a,30
NA,"member of this Parliament, who happens",30
NA,"to conduct a newspaper, to assail any of",30
NA,the members of the council. I f only for,30
NA,reason that the council has no poli-,30
NA,"affiliations, I am glad that the",30
NA,for Immigration has stated,30
NA,publicly that the work of the council will,30
NA,on. Members of the council have a,30
NA,fine feeling for the future welfare of their,30
NA,and an intense willingness to co-,30
NA,in furthering the country's immi-,30
NA,gration policy. Those qualities are too,30
NA,"valuable to be lost, and I take this oppor-",30
NA,tunity to place on record my tribute to the,30
NA,work done by members of the council.,30
NA,A' tremendous amount of work remains,30
NA,to be done in the field of immigration.,30
NA,of Neither the Opposition in this Parlia-,30
NA,"ment, nor any other section of the Aus-",30
NA,"tralian people, is justified in attacking",30
NA,the Minister for Immigration for his,30
NA,rigid administration of the Immigration,30
NA,Act. I t is all very well to make exclu-,30
NA,The sions into spirituality and liberalism-,30
NA,"spelt with a small "" 1""-bu t the Minis-",30
NA,job is to administer the law. I f too,30
NA,much publicity has been given to the way,30
NA,"in which the law has been administered,",30
NA,it is the fault not of the Minister but of,30
NA,those who have seized on the situation in,30
NA,"order to obtain cheap, emotional effects.",30
NA,Clergymen have decorated their sermons,30
NA,"with appeals about humanity, when next",31
NA,"door are seething slums, the inhabitants",31
NA,of which are much closer to them than,31
NA,are the evacuees who are being sent back,31
NA,to their own countries in accordance with,31
NA,an arrangement into which they them-,31
NA,selves entered. I t is beside the point for,31
NA,"people, who adopt a hypocritical, super-",31
NA,sensitive attitude to the White Aus-,31
NA,tralia policy to charge the Minis-,31
NA,ter with committing an administra-,31
NA,tive faux pas. Such attacks may do very,31
NA,well for a press story or to adorn a sermon,31
NA,but deep in the hearts of all Australians,31
NA,is a feeling that we should make no con-,31
NA,cession on the White Australia policy.,31
NA,The right honorable member for North,31
NA,Sydney reminded us of his 50 years' ex-,31
NA,"perience in this Parliament, and he",31
NA,repeated what had been said at various,31
NA,times during that period. I claim that,31
NA,we have much to show for our immigra-,31
NA,"tion policy, and we have a plan for the",31
NA,future. That policy is our answer to the,31
NA,call of the empty spaces of this continent.,31
NA,"The Government, in its application of the",31
NA,"White Australia policy, is applying the",31
NA,"law, and adhering to tradition. Erom the",31
NA,"first days of federation, the settled policy",31
NA,of Australia has been to keep Australia,31
NA,free and white.,31
Mr ANTHONY ,Richmond) [12.27].,31
NA,-Immigratio n ought to be a non-party,31
NA,"matter in this Parliament, and it has",31
NA,been treated substantially in that way. I n,31
NA,"general, the policy of the Minister for",31
NA,"Immigration ( Mr Calwell), in taking",31
NA,advantage of the unique opportunity to,31
NA,obtain a large flow of immigrants from,31
NA,"Europe, has met with the approval of",31
NA,honorable members of all parties. I am,31
NA,sure that if the forthcoming general elec-,31
NA,tion should result in a change of govern-,31
NA,"ment, tbe same policy will be continued,",31
NA,because we all recognize the need to,31
NA,populate and develop the country. Hav-,31
NA,ing regard to the changed attitude towards,31
NA,"population among the white races, it is",31
NA,necessary for us to increase our numbers,31
NA,by bringing here surplus population from,31
NA,Europe.,31
NA,"I t is a great pity, however, that the",31
NA,"Minister should have thought it necessary,",31
NA,"in administering his department, to bethe",31
NA,have as he has towards the very few,31
NA,"Asiatics, or persons of Asiatic extraction,",31
NA,who were resident in Australia. This,31
NA,handful of persons has been the cause of,31
NA,much dissension and international i l l,31
NA,feeling. The Minister's treatment of,31
NA,them has appeared to put us in the,31
NA,"wrong, and has earned for us a reputa-",31
NA,tion for being harsh and intransigent on,31
NA,"the subject of colour, and has done noth-",31
NA,ing to strengthen the White Australia,31
NA,policy or obtain acceptance for it. I t,31
NA,has highliehted the objection to colour,31
NA,that is inherent in the White Australia,31
NA,"policy, and publicized that objection to our",31
NA,"disadvantage throughout the world, par-",31
NA,ticularly in Asiatic countries. On more,31
NA,than one occasion the Minister himself,31
NA,"has said that the term "" White Aus-",31
NA,"tralia "" should not be used, yet he has",31
NA,made use of it more than any one else.,31
NA,I regret that his fine record in developing,31
NA,migration from Europe should be marred,31
NA,"by these incidents which, in themselves,,",31
NA,are of a minor nature. I n one instance,31
NA,"a few persons may be involved, or in",31
NA,"another instance 27 Chinese, or indivi-",31
NA,dual persons as in the case of Mrs Ang,31
NA,and that of Mrs O'Keefe. Those inci-,31
NA,dents do not really amount to anything-,31
NA,"in our immigration policy, and the Go-",31
NA,vernment should exercise a little dis-,31
NA,cretion in matters of that kind.,31
NA,Dealing with the proposed vote for,31
NA,the Department of External Territories,31
NA,I wish to discuss what I consider to,31
NA,be the very harsh and unsympathetic,31
NA,treatment that the Government has meted,31
NA,out to widows of civilians who lost thei*-,31
NA,lives when the Japanese captured Rabaul.,31
NA,I t is well-known that the lives of practi-,31
NA,cally all civilians who were at Rabaul,31
NA,at the time the Japanese attacked were,31
NA,wilfully thrown away by the Australian,31
NA,"Government. I say "" w i l f u l l y "" because-",31
NA,those civilians had no hope pf defending-,31
NA,Rabaul. I am not now talking about,31
NA,the armed forces. At that time there was,31
NA,sufficient shipping in the harbour to-,31
NA,"evacuate the civilian population, but the",31
NA,Curtin Government ordered that those,31
NA,civilians should remain at Rabaul. The-,31
NA,Acting Administrator of New Guinea,31
NA,radioed to Australia to obtain permission,31
NA,"to evacuate those civilians, but that",31
NA,"request was refused. Consequently, when",31
NA,"J apanese struck, many of the civilians",31
NA,were killed whilst the remainder were-,31
NA,captured. I n the fullness of time their,31
NA,"fate was revealed. Ultimately, after a",32
NA,"considerable period, it was discovered",32
NA,that a great many of those who survived,32
NA,the Japanese attack lost their lives when,32
NA,Montevideo Maru was sunk. During the,32
NA,"period that their fate remained unknown,",32
NA,the Government made liberal payments to,32
NA,widows of male civilians on the basis,32
NA,-of tlie salary that the latter had been,32
NA,"receiving. However, when hostilities",32
NA,-ended an accounting was made to those,32
NA,widows and in each instance where it was,32
NA,"possible, to get back money paid to them",32
NA,in excess of the ordinary pension rate of,32
NA,from £2 10s. a week the Government,32
NA,took action to recover such moneys. I n,32
NA,some instances it did so by making deduc-,32
NA,tions from payments that the widows,32
NA,were entitled to draw as superannuation,32
NA,benefits for which their late husbands,32
NA,had contributed. I am in possession,32
NA,of several statements issued by the Depart-,32
NA,ment of External Territories that show,32
NA,"that some of these widows, instead of",32
NA,"receiving a very substantial amount, in",32
NA,"some cases hundreds of pounds, in the",32
NA,"form of superannuation benefit, received",32
NA,practically nothing at all after these,32
NA,-deductions had been made by the Go-,32
NA,vernment. I trust that the Government,32
NA,will see that justice is done to these,32
NA,"widows, and I propose to show how",32
NA,it can do so.,32
NA,"First, however, I draw attention par-",32
NA,ticularly to the case of Captain H .,32
NA,"Edwards, M.C, D.O.M., M.M., whose",32
NA,widow now lives in Sydney. Captain,32
NA,Edwards had a distinguished military,32
NA,record in World War I . I read the,32
NA,following quotation from a letter that,32
NA,he received from General Birdwood:-,32
NA,I must congratulate you on your excellent,32
NA,record of which you may well be proud i n,32
NA,"having gained the M i l i t a r y Cross, Distin-",32
NA,"guished Conduct Medal, and Militar y Medal.",32
NA,I t is indeed a fine achievement .and I trust,32
NA,that you w i l l meet with still further success,32
NA,i n the future.,32
NA,-Captain Edwards's brigade commander,32
NA,wrote to him as follows:-,32
NA,I trust that you w i l l be long spared to wear,32
NA,those ribbons. They betoken a spendid record,32
NA,of great hardships and dangers and adherence,32
NA,to duty under all circumstances.,32
NA,I should like to tell honorable members,32
NA,how the Government treated the widow,32
NA,of that gallant officer. He was at Rabaul,32
NA,at the time that the Japanese struck.,32
NA,He had been residing there for many,32
NA,years previously and was second in com-,32
NA,mand of the New Guinea Volunteer,32
NA,Regiment a few months before the Japa-,32
NA,nese invasion. He was president of the,32
NA,"Rabaul branch of the Returned Sailors,",32
NA,Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League,32
NA,"of Australia. However, because at the",32
NA,time of invasion he was not i n military,32
NA,uniform as the result of some dispute that,32
NA,had occurred between himself and others,32
NA,"in the military forces at Rabaul, he was",32
NA,not considered to have been a soldier at,32
NA,"the time of his death. Consequently,",32
NA,despite the fact that the estate of any-,32
NA,body who died as a soldier was exempt,32
NA,"from estate duty, Mrs Edwards was",32
NA,charged duty amounting to £67 on her,32
NA,husband's estate which was valued at,32
NA,£700. She had to pay that duty because,32
NA,her husband was not considered to have,32
NA,been a soldier at the time of his death.,32
NA,I am in possession of the documents in,32
NA,the case and I shall be pleased to pass,32
NA,them on to the Minister. I suggest that,32
NA,"the following provision, which is set out",32
NA,in a letter which Mrs Edwards has,32
NA,"received from Mr Clive Evatt, a Minister",32
NA,"in the New South Wales Government,",32
NA,should apply in this instance-,32
NA,No death duty shall be payable in respect,32
NA,"of the estate of a member of the naval, military",32
NA,or air forces of the Commonwealth of Aus-,32
NA,tralia . . . who during the present war,32
NA,between His Majesty the K i ng and Germany,32
NA,and her allies or within one year after its,32
NA,termination dies on active service or as the,32
NA,result of injury received or disease contracted,32
NA,on active service.,32
NA,Captain Edwards was at Rabaul when the,32
NA,Japanese struck. He was the most,32
NA,highly decorated soldier at Rabaul and,32
NA,he lost his life because the Government,32
NA,refused permission for civilians to be,32
NA,evacuated. Because he was not con-,32
NA,sidered to have been a soldier at the time,32
NA,"of his death, his widow has had to pay",32
NA,the penalty. She has also been denied,32
NA,the rate of pension payable to the widow,32
NA,"of an officer, which is considerably more",32
NA,than that payable to widows of civilians.,32
NA,The Government can do justice in this,32
NA,case. Evidence given in the New Guinea,32
NA,timber leases case revealed that the Min-,32
NA,ister can apply the provisions of an,32
NA,ordinance retrospectively. The particular,32
NA,ordinance cited in that case was Ordi-,32
NA,"nance No. 5 of 1947, being "" an ordinance",32
NA,to amend the Workers' Compensation,32
NA,Ordinances 1941 of the Territory of New,33
NA,"Guinea "". That ordinance increased the",33
NA,amount of maximum compensation from,33
NA,"£750 to £1,000. I t was dated the 14th",33
NA,"May, 1947, under the signature of the",33
NA,"Governor-General and issued by "" E. J.",33
NA,"Ward, Minister of State for External",33
NA,"Territories "". I n evidence given during",33
NA,r.he New Guinea timber leases case it,33
NA,was stated that one person who was favor-,33
NA,ably affected by the back-dating of that,33
NA,"ordinance was a friend, or relative, of the about it.",33
NA,Minister for External Territories. A,33
NA,notable feature of the amendment effected,33
NA,by that ordinance was that its commence-,33
NA,ment was made retrospective to the lst,33
NA,"January, 1947; that is, it was back-",33
NA,"dated five months in order, so it was",33
NA,alleged in evidence given in the New,33
NA,"Guinea timber leases case, to cover the",33
NA,"circumstances of a friend, or relative, of",33
NA,the Minister for External Territories.,33
NA,I have no evidence to offer in support,33
NA,of that statement except the evidence that,33
NA,was given in the course of the trial that,33
NA,"I have mentioned. However, in view of",33
NA,the facts I have given I shall not believe,33
NA,that it is not possible for the Govern-,33
NA,ment to do justice to the widows of,33
NA,civilians who lost their lives when the,33
NA,Japanese captured Rabaul. Those,33
NA,civilians were at Rabaul as the represen-,33
NA,tatives of Australia. I shall not agree,33
NA,that the Government cannot recognize,33
NA,"Mrs Edwards's, claim and refund the",33
NA,death duty that has been charged to her,33
NA,"on account of the estate of her husband,",33
NA,or that she cannot be given the rate of,33
NA,"pension payable to the widow of an officer,",33
NA,because her case has been settled. I shall,33
NA,not accept these excuses when I find that,33
NA,remedial action can be taken to benefit,33
NA,somebody who happens to enjoy a,33
NA,favoured position with the Minister.,33
NA,Those are facts.,33
Mr WHITE ,The y do not get all their,33
NA,pension entitlement.,33
Mr BARNARD ,The y get children's,33
NA,pensions.,33
Mr ANTHONY , I am prepared to,33
NA,introduce to the Minister for Repatriacivilians,33
NA,tion ( Mr Barnard) a deputation of the war.,33
NA,widows of NewGuinea civilians.,33
NA,I am prepared to introduce him during,33
NA,to Mrs Edwards and I am preber,33
NA,pared to show him the commendations,33
NA,for gallantry of Captain Edwards by,33
NA,"King, General Birdwood and General",33
NA,Rawlinson. Captain Edwards has not,33
NA,been treated as a soldier under the Aus-,33
NA,tralian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. This,33
NA,is the first opportunity that I have had,33
NA,of ventilating this matter for a very long,33
NA,time. The consideration of the Estimates,33
NA,"was "" guillotined "" last year, and I had",33
NA,no opportunity to ventilate it then.,33
NA,"Now that I have ventilated it, I hope",33
NA,that the Government will do something,33
Mr CHAMBERS ,Adelaide-Ministe r,33
NA,for the Army) [12.41] - I feel that the,33
NA,Department of the Army is involved in,33
NA,"the case of Captain Edwards, who,",33
NA,according to the honorable member for,33
NA,"Richmond ( Mr Anthony), took an active",33
NA,part in the defence of Rabaul when Japan,33
NA,struck there.,33
Mr ANTHONY ,H e was second in,33
NA,command of the New Guinea Volunteer,33
NA,Regiment.,33
Mr CHAMBERS,"Yes. . Apparently,,",33
NA,the whole case has been based on the,33
NA,fact that he was not in uniform at the,33
NA,time. That involves my department.,33
NA,This is the first I have heard of the,33
NA,case. I shall discuss it with the honor-,33
NA,able member between now and the end of,33
NA,the week. I should be glad if the honor-,33
NA,able member would supply me with the,33
NA,relevant documents. I propose to have,33
NA,the case investigated by my own depart-,33
NA,ment. I will investigate it myself. I f,33
NA,there is any substance in the comments,33
NA,of the honorable gentleman and an in-,33
NA,justice has been done to the widow of,33
NA,"Captain Edwards, the proper procedure",33
NA,"will be followed, and the injustice will be",33
NA,rectified.,33
Mr WHITE ,Balaclava) [12.43] -A s,33
NA,1 have insufficient time to deal with the,33
NA,Department of Immigration and the,33
NA,"Department of External Territories, I",33
NA,content myself with saying that I strongly,33
NA,support the remarks of the honorable-,33
NA,member for Richmond ( Mr Anthony),33
NA,about the treatment of the widows of,33
NA,killed in New Guinea during the,33
NA,The Minister for Repatriation,33
NA,"( Mr Barnard), who was interjecting",33
NA,the speech of the honorable mem-,33
NA,"for Richmond, knows that a few-",33
NA,weeks ago I asked why the widows and,33
NA,the dependants of men who had lost their,33
NA,Uvea i n the civil service of New Guinea,34
NA,had not received f u l l repatriation benefits.,34
NA,I asked that he confer with the Minister,34
NA,for External Territories on the subject.,34
NA,I do not know on which Minister the,34
NA,"blame lies, but I do know that i t lies on",34
NA,the Governinent as a whole. The Minis-,34
NA,ter knows that the widows of those men,34
NA,do not receive medical benefits; although,34
NA,war widows do. They do not have,34
NA,the opportunity to obtain a war,34
NA,"service home, although war widows",34
NA,do. Those are just two instances,34
NA,of the disparity between the treat-,34
NA,ment of those widows and,34
NA,widows. I hope that there w i ll be no,34
NA,further equivocation.,34
NA,I applaud what the Minister fo r,34
NA,Immigration ( Mr Calwell) has done to,34
NA,"bring foreign migrants to Australia, but",34
NA,we must have a greater ratio of British,34
NA,migrants.,34

Mr HARRISON ,Wentworth) [2.15].,34
NA,-Befor e attempting to approve of the,34
NA,proposed vote for the Commonwealth,34
NA,Scientific and Industrial Research,34
NA,"Organization, which includes the provi-",34
NA,"sion of £33,000 f o r investigation of",34
NA,"nuclear energy, the committee should pay",34
NA,close attention to circumstances connected,34
NA,with this organization. Although the,34
NA,Government has placed the Common-,34
NA,wealth Scientific and Industrial Research,34
NA,Organization under administrative con-,34
NA,"trol of the Public Service Board, quite",34
NA,obviously i t is still clouded with a certain,34
NA,amount of suspicion. A t the recent con-,34
NA,ference i n Canada i n relation to atomic,34
NA,"energy research, although representatives",34
NA,"of the United States of America, Canada",34
NA,"and the United Kingdom were present,",34
NA,it is significant that Australia was not,34
NA,war represented. That highlights certain,34
NA,matters that were revealed i n this,34
NA,chamber not long ago when i t was shown,34
NA,that there still exists i n the minds of,34
NA,people associated with atomic energy,34
NA,research a grave suspicion that i f secret,34
NA,developments i n the field of nuclear,34
NA,"energy were made available to Australia,",34
NA,that information might leak out to Soviet,34
NA,Russia. That was the basis of a lengthy,34
NA,"debate during .which certain, documents",34
NA,were produced that caused an immense,34
NA,amount of public interest. I t seems to,34
NA,me that that suspicion still exists i n,34
NA,the minds of people overseas. Australia,34
NA,is still excluded f r o m the inner councils,34
NA,of the world powers i n relation to atomic,34
NA,research for purposes of defence. That,34
NA,"is not to be wondered at. Although.,",34
NA,"SERVICE. under pressure, the Government removed",34
NA,the aeronautical section of the Council,34
NA,for Scientific and Industrial Research,34
NA,f r o m its matrix and placed i t under,34
NA,the administration of the Public Service,34
NA,"Board, suspicion has not been allayed",34
NA,in the minds of our allies overseas,34
NA,who are closely associated w i th us,34
NA,i n preserving the peace of the world.,34
NA,The reason is not hard to discover. From,34
NA,time to time honorable members have,34
NA,learned of the appointment of Commu-,34
NA,nists to what was the Council f o r,34
NA,Scientific and Industrial Research.,34
NA,Although the Minister for Post-war,34
NA,Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) did not,34
NA,"select the appointees, he approved",34
NA,of their appointment. He approved of,34
NA,a studentship being granted to Mr .,34
NA,"Kaiser, who was sent overseas to further",34
NA,his studies i n the field of nuclear physics.,34
NA,A fte r he had attended at Oxford U n i -,34
NA,"versity for about eighteen months, i t was",34
NA,revealed that he was a Communist. He,34
NA,distinguished himself by taking part in,35
NA,a demonstration of Communists at Aus-,35
NA,tralia House i n London while still a,35
NA,student and under the control of the,35
NA,Oommonwealth Scientific and Industrial,35
NA,Research. Organization. That was a,35
NA,demonstration by Communists against the,35
NA,action that had been taken by this Go-,35
NA,vernment in connexion with the coal,35
NA,strike. By taking part i n that demon-,35
NA,stration he revealed himself as a militant,35
NA,Communist.,35
NA,Erom time to time honorable members,35
NA,on the Government side of the chamber,35
NA,have declared that every care is taken to,35
NA,screen persons before they are appointed,35
NA,to positions in connexion with defence,35
NA,"work investigation, about which secrecy",35
NA,must be maintained. I t is apparent that,35
NA,either this man was not screened before,35
NA,"appointment, or that he was appointed by",35
NA,the Government i n the ful l know-,35
NA,"ledge that he was a Communist, and",35
NA,was then deliberately sent overseas,35
NA,to take part in nuclear investigation.,35
NA,He was reported to have been a research,35
NA,officer with the Council for Scientific,35
NA,Industrial Research for six years in,35
NA,Sydney. Indeed the Minister for Post-,35
NA,war Reconstruction told honorable mem',35
NA,bers on another occasion that during the,35
NA,war period Mr Kaiser had been engaged,35
NA,on very close investigations of these,35
NA,"matters, and that there was no reason",35
NA,to believe that he had divulged any,35
NA,secrets about them.,35
Mr DEDMAN , I said distinctly that,35
NA,no information had ever been divulged.,35
NA,MT. HARRISON -Unles s the Minishad,35
NA,ter knew what had transpired within,35
NA,"Soviet Russia, he could not be so definite",35
NA,"in that regard. However, I accept his",35
NA,assurance. Possibly he has some knowrefused,35
NA,ledge of matters that have been made,35
NA,availahle to Soviet Russia and can make,35
NA,that assertion with some degree of,35
NA,accuracy. A person with no knowledge,35
NA,of what matters had been disclosed to,35
NA,the Soviet espionage service would,35
NA,in a position to be so emphatic in that,35
NA,regard. I accept the Minister's assurance,35
NA,that nothing was made available to Soviet,35
NA,Russia. Apparently tbe Minister forgets,35
NA,that during the war Soviet Russia was,35
NA,an ally of ours and that at that time there,35
NA,was no talk of atomic warfare involving,35
NA,"Russia. A t that time, also, secret infor-",35
NA,"mation was held jointly by the Soviet, \",35
NA,"the United States of America, and the",35
NA,"United Kingdom. However, Soviet",35
NA,Russia is now conducting a cold war,35
NA,"against its former allies, and, as the",35
NA,"Prime Minister ( Mr Chifley) has said,",35
NA,is seeking by sinister disruptive methods,35
NA,"to undermine the democracies, including",35
NA,remote Australia.,35
NA,Following the demonstration to which,35
NA,I have referred Mr Kaiser is reported,35
NA,to have said in England-,35
NA,The C.S.I.E. knew my views before I was,35
NA,sent here.,35
NA,"This, in spite of the fact that he had been",35
NA,sent overseas by the organization to learn,35
NA,about nuclear physics! According to Mr.,35
NA,Kaiser i t knew that he was a Com-,35
NA,munist. Apparently i t sent him over-,35
NA,seas to investigate nuclear energy so,35
NA,ihat he would gain inside knowledge of,35
NA,this su'bject. That he has no great love,35
NA,of this country is evidenced by the fact,35
NA,that he took part in the Communist raid,35
NA,to which I have referred. Although this,35
NA,and man was an avowed Communist he was,35
NA,"appointed to the studentship overseas,",35
NA,"with resultant waste of public money, and",35
NA,in effect established a fifth column over-,35
NA,seas. Mr Kaiser was also reported to,35
NA,have said-,35
NA,I would refuse to undertake any secret,35
NA,research on the atom on account of ray convic-,35
NA,"tions, but I have not been asked to.",35
NA,This young Communist forsook his loyalty,35
NA,to this country when he made a protest,35
NA,in London about the manner in which,35
NA,Australia was conducting its affairs. I f he,35
NA,been told that the coal strike was a,35
NA,sinister attempt on the part of agents of,35
NA,a hostile power to undermine our indus-,35
NA,"trial, potential, would Kaiser still have",35
NA,to undertake secret research into,35
NA,atomic energy? I believe that i f this,35
NA,young man had been given an oppor tunity,35
NA,to pursue his investigations of the most,35
NA,secret matters he would not have refrained,35
NA,from doing so because he has no loyalty to,35
NA,not be this country. He also said-,35
NA,Before taking up this research I was in,35
NA,Sydnej doing research in the most highly secret,35
NA,;,35
NA,division of radar-rada r counter measures-,35
NA,and my work was considered satisfactory.,35
NA,I believe that this statement by Kaiser,35
NA,should be placed on record i n support,35
NA,of the Minister's statement that this,35
NA,young man had been engaged in secret,36
NA,"work during the war period, when",36
NA,many secrets were jointly held hy,36
NA,"Soviet Russia, the United States of",36
NA,"America, and the United Kingdom.",36
NA,When Russia determined to wage a cold,36
NA,"war against the democracies, the position",36
NA,became quite different. Notwithstanding,36
NA,tliat the Government knew of this young,36
NA,"man's convictions, it sent him overseas",36
NA,to undertake most secret research in the,36
NA,field of nuclear energy. By taking part,36
NA,in the demonstration h'e proved that he,36
NA,has no love for his country and that he,36
NA,is prepared to take any action to discredit,36
NA,it in the eyes of the world so as to,36
NA,the objectives of communism. I t is,36
NA,regrettable that the taxpayers' money,36
NA,sbould be wasted on studentship benefits,36
NA,"to a young man, who, while enjoy-",36
NA,"ing their advantages, sought to bring",36
NA,his country into disrepute. I t is true,36
NA,that after he had publicly revealed,36
NA,himself as a Communist and a man,36
NA,"opposed to the interests of his country,",36
NA,his studentship was determined. I f he,36
NA,"had not taken part in the demonstration,",36
NA,"this avowed Communist, whose convic-",36
NA,"tions were well known to the Government,",36
NA,would still be employed in an overseas,36
NA,laboratory conducting investigations re-,36
NA,"garding nuclear energy, and would be in a",36
NA,position to obtain secret information,36
NA,which would be of value to a potential,36
NA,enemy. That information might well,36
NA,have been sent to Soviet Russia. Is it,36
NA,<iny wonder that Australia is denied,36
NA,admittance to discussions held by the,36
NA,"great democratic countries of the world,",36
NA,including a country which cannot boast,36
NA,"as we do, that its peoples are of 90 per",36
NA,cent. British stock ? Australia is ex-,36
NA,r-luded from participation in such,36
NA,discussions because the Australian Go-,36
NA,vernment is still suspect. Notwithstand-,36
NA,ing what may be said to the contrary by,36
NA,"the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction,",36
NA,those whom the Government appoints,36
NA,to positions in which they are,36
NA,given access to secret and vital in-,36
NA,formation are not effectively screened.,36
NA,I have no doubt that the Minister will,36
NA,claim that all those who are associated,36
NA,with secret defence work now have to take,36
NA,the oath of allegiance. That may be true;,36
NA,but does the honorable gentleman claim,36
NA,that the mere taking of an oath of,36
NA,allegiance will make a man trustworthy?,36
NA,He knows very well that Communists do,36
NA,not regard themselves as being bound,36
NA,by an oath of allegiance. Only recently,36
NA,honorable members opposite have ques-,36
NA,tioned the value of administering an,36
NA,oath of allegiance to a Communist.,36
NA,I draw attention to this matter in order,36
NA,to emphasize the need for the closest,36
NA,scrutiny of the credentials of all those,36
NA,who are employed on work of a secret,36
NA,character. There is something wrong,36
NA,with the administration of a government,36
NA,which permits the taxpayers' money to be,36
NA,expended on the provision of studentships,36
NA,further for known Communists. Kaiser was,36
NA,appointed as a research student in the,36
NA,"field of nuclear energy at a time when,",36
NA,"as far as we know, Russia did not possess",36
NA,the secret of the atomic bomb. Russia,36
NA,now claims to have probed the secret,36
NA,of the bomb. I wonder how much of,36
NA,the knowledge which the Soviet now,36
NA,claims to possess came from representa-,36
NA,tives of the democratic countries who,36
NA,were working as a part of Soviet Russia's,36
NA,fifth column. Honorable members will,36
NA,recall the disclosures that were made at,36
NA,the investigation held recently in the,36
NA,United States of America in regard to,36
NA,Communist activities. They will also,36
NA,remember that quantities of uranium of,36
NA,certain grades were flown from America,36
NA,to Russia. Leakages of vital strategic,36
NA,materials from the democratic countries,36
NA,have taken place with too much frequency.,36
NA,The Government cannot be too exacting,36
NA,in its screening of the persons selected to,36
NA,go overseas to carry out secret research,36
NA,work. We have heen told about the,36
NA,"Pomeroys, the Rudkins, and other Com-",36
NA,munists that were employed i n the orga-,36
NA,nization formerly known as the Council,36
NA,for Scientific and Industrial Research.,36
NA,We all recall the revelations that were,36
NA,made by the Leader of the Australian,36
NA,Country party ( Mr Eadden) concerning,36
NA,statements that. were made at a,36
NA,meeting of Empire Prime Ministers at,36
NA,"Downing-street, and we remember also",36
NA,the statements that were made in relation,36
NA,to this subject by the Minister for De-,36
NA,fence at a meeting of the executive of,36
NA,the former Council for Scientific and,36
NA,Industrial Research. These revelations,36
NA,lend colour to the remarks that I have,36
NA,just made. Until such time as Aus-,37
NA,tralia is again brought into the discus-,37
NA,sions of the democratic nations in relation,37
NA,to matters of the highest defence signifi-,37
NA,"cance, the Australian Government will",37
NA,remain suspect. The Minister for Post-,37
NA,war Eeoonstruction and the Government,37
NA,have done nothing whatever to dispel the,37
NA,distrust of Australia which is manifest in,37
NA,high defence circles overseas.,37
Mr DEDMAN ,Corio-Ministe r for,37
NA,Defence and Minister for Post-war,37
NA,Eeoonstruction) [2.34] -The honorable,37
NA,member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison),37
NA,haa repeated a number of allegations,37
NA,that have been made on several,37
NA,occasions in this chamber notwithstand-,37
NA,ing that they were refuted whenever,37
NA,they were made. His allegations against,37
NA,the Government are completely without,37
NA,foundation. He has referred to the activi-,37
NA,ties of an individual named Kaiser and,37
NA,"to the attitude which, he suggests, has",37
NA,been taken by the United States of,37
NA,America in relation to certain meetings,37
NA,between representatives of the United,37
NA,"States, Canada and the United Kingdom.",37
NA,The latter subject was raised by way of,37
NA,question in this chamber some time ago,37
NA,and the position was then fully explained.,37
NA,"I n spite of that, however, the honorable",37
NA,member persists in repeating assertions,37
NA,which are quite untrue. For the benefit,37
NA,"of honorable members, I shall again",37
NA,explain the position in relation to the,37
NA,association of the United States of,37
NA,America with the United Kingdom and,37
NA,Canada in atomic energy research.,37
NA,"During the war period, there was an agree-",37
NA,"ment between the United Kingdom,",37
NA,Canada and the United States of America,37
NA,to share information on the development,37
NA,"of the atomic -bomb, and to co-operate in",37
NA,that work. No other country in the world,37
NA,was invited to take part in the joint,37
NA,"deliberations, or to assist in the project.",37
NA,"The undertaking was completely secret,",37
NA,and all information about it was with-,37
NA,held from every other country. The work,37
NA,was confined to the three countries that I,37
NA,have named because it was so important,37
NA,that no risk of the secrets of the atomic,37
NA,bomb being revealed to the outside world,37
NA,could be taken. The United Kingdom was,37
NA,able to contribute something to the,37
NA,development of the atomic bomb. Canada,37
NA,too was able to make a contribution. Aus-,37
NA,"tralia could not contribute anything, and",37
NA,therefore was not invited to participate,37
NA,in the work in any way. At the end of,37
NA,"the war, the United States of America",37
NA,made it clear that the agreement undor,37
NA,which work on the atomic bomb had been,37
NA,carried out co-operatively during the war,37
NA,"had ended, and ceased to make available",37
NA,any information on atomic energy to the,37
NA,United Kingdom and Canada. From that,37
NA,"time onwards, the United States of",37
NA,America worked on the atomic bomb in,37
NA,"isolation. Since then, however, certain",37
NA,developments have occurred both in the,37
NA,"United Kingdom and Canada, and the",37
NA,knowledge of how to manufacture the,37
NA,atomic bomb has become more widespread.,37
NA,There is no longer any secret about it. As,37
NA,I have said in this chamber on many,37
NA,"occasions, any nation that is prepared to",37
NA,devote the necessary scientific and indus-,37
NA,trial resources to the manufacture of the,37
NA,atomic bomb could achieve some measure,37
NA,of success in a reasonable period of time.,37
NA,"Australia itself, with the knowledge that",37
NA,"can be read in pamphlets and books could,",37
NA,if it had the necessary scientific and in-,37
NA,dustrial resources-a t present it has not-,37
NA,manufacture the atomic bomb without the,37
NA,assistance of the United States of America,37
NA,or any other country. That is the plain,37
NA,truth as physicists and others who have,37
NA,studied atomic energy know. As I have,37
NA,"said, for some time after the war, the",37
NA,United States of America worked on the,37
NA,"bomb in isolation, but now that so much",37
NA,is known in other countries about the,37
NA,atomic bomb and atomic energy for indus-,37
NA,"trial purposes, the United States of",37
NA,America has apparently decided that once,37
NA,again i t will endeavour to work i n co-,37
NA,operation with the United Kingdom and,37
NA,"Canada on certain projects. That is why,",37
NA,"I imagine, those two countries have been",37
NA,invited to attend a conference. Australia,37
NA,is not interested in the development of the,37
NA,"atomic bomb, because, a3 I have said, we",37
NA,have neither the scientific nor the indus-,37
NA,trial resources to set aside for that,37
NA,"purpose, consequently we have no wish to",37
NA,"be represented at the conference, even",37
NA,if we were invited to do so. The,37
NA,absence of an invitation does not,37
NA,mean that Australia is mistrusted. The,37
NA,meeting simply represents the re-introduc-,37
NA,tion of the arrangement which operated,37
NA,between the three countries during the,37
NA,"war. Australia has not been invited, not",38
NA,"because of any distrust, but simply because",38
NA,we cannot make any contribution to the,38
NA,-development of the atomic bomb and do,38
NA,.not wish to do so.,38
Mr RYAN ,Wh y not ?,38
Mr DEDMAN ,"Because , as I have",38
NA,"said, we have neither the scientific nor",38
NA,industrial resources to develop the atomio,38
NA,bomb.,38
Mr MCEWEN ,Bu t the Minister said,38
NA,that Australia did not wish to make,38
NA,contribution to that work.,38
Mr DEDMAN ,Tha t is so.,38
Mr MCEWEN ,Why ?,38
Mr DEDMAN ,Surel y our lack of,38
NA,resources is a logical reason for our,38
NA,wishing to participate in that work!,38
NA,What is the good of worrying about scholarship was quite untrue.,38
NA,-developing a weapon of that kind when we,38
NA,have not the resources to produce i t,38
NA,if we had the necessary knowledge 1 stated,38
NA,"Surely it is clear that, in the circumin",38
NA,"stances, the Government of this country short time ago.",38
NA,would not wish to have any information,38
NA,about the production of the atomic bomb.,38
NA,"We are, however, interested in the",38
NA,velopment of atomic energy for indusobjectionable,38
NA,"trial purposes, and we are undertaking be withdrawn.",38
NA,certain wort in that connexion. We hope,38
NA,with the arrival of Professor Oliphant,38
NA,Australia to be able to maike a valuable,38
NA,contribution to the development of intion later.,38
NA,"dustrial atomic energy, but again, in that",38
NA,sphere we do not require any informa-,38
NA,"tion from the United Kingdom, Canada",38
NA,or the United States of America. Certain withdrawn.,38
NA,technical problems- I shall not attempt,38
NA,to explain them-i n relation to the use,38
NA,"of atomic energy for industrial purposes,",38
NA,.have to be overcome. Those problems,38
NA,liave not yet been solved in other,38
NA,tries which have a substantial lead,38
NA,"Anstralia but, with that eminent scien-",38
NA,"tist, Professor Oliphant, in charge",38
NA,"-work here, we shall have, perhaps,",38
NA,better chance than most other countries,38
NA,"of solving those difficulties, because",38
NA,-certain local climatic conditions and,38
NA,fact that we have isolated areas for,38
NA,perimental purposes. We intend to work,38
NA,on those lines.,38
NA,The lionorable member for Wentworth,38
NA,said that the Kaiser incident was,38
NA,.a series of incidents which had produced,38
NA,the alleged feeling of mistrust of,38
NA,142],38
NA,tralia on the part of the United States,38
NA,"of America, Canada, and the United",38
NA,"Kingdom. The honorable member, when",38
NA,"speaking of the Kaiser incident, re-",38
NA,peated certain other statements which are,38
NA,"quite untrue. First, the honorable gentle-",38
NA,man said that I had approved of Kaiser's,38
NA,the appointment. That is quite untrue. I,38
NA,"did not do so. Of course, the honorable",38
NA,"member does not care what he says, as",38
NA,long as he can get some publicity for the,38
NA,arguments that he puts forward. I f he,38
NA,a can besmirch the good name of Australia,38
NA,and the Commonwealth Scientific and,38
NA,"Industrial Research Organization, he",38
NA,does not care whether he speaks the truth,38
NA,"or not. So, I say to the honorable gentle-",38
NA,not man that his statement that I had ap-,38
NA,proved of the selection of Kaiser for this,38
NA,The,38
NA,honorable member had no excuse for,38
NA,"even lying about the matter, because I had",38
NA,the position clearly in this chamber,38
NA,answer to a question asked only a,38
Mr HARRISON , I rise to order. I,38
NA,take exception to the Minister's state-,38
NA,dement that I was lying. The words are,38
NA,"to me, and I ask that they",38
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN , Mr.,38
NA,"in Burke) -Th e honorable member may, i f",38
NA,"he so desires, make a personal explana-",38
Mr HARRISON ,Bu t the words are,38
NA,"offensive to me, and I ask that they be",38
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ,Th e,38
NA,Minister said that there was no exeuse for,38
NA,lying about the matter. I f the honorable,38
NA,member for Wentworth claims to have,38
NA,counbeen misrepresented he may make a,38
NA,over personal explanation later.,38
Mr DEDMAN , I repeat that the,38
NA,"of ""honorable member for Wentworth had no",38
NA,a excuse for making that lying statement,38
NA,because I had already explained the posi-,38
NA,of tion in this chamber in answer to a,38
NA,the question. I said that Kaiser had been,38
NA,exselected for this scholarship not by the,38
NA,"Minister, but by the executive. I named",38
NA,the members of the executive of the,38
NA,Council for Scientific and Industrial Re-,38
NA,one of search who selected Mr Kaiser.,38
Mr HARRISON ,Th e members of the,38
NA,Ausexecutive recommended that he should,38
NA,"go to the United Kingdom, but ""vvho sent",39
NA,him ?,39
Mr DEDMAN , T h e executive of,39
NA,the Council for Scientific and Industrial,39
NA,Research sent hi m there. The Minister,39
NA,did not do so. I am pointing out the,39
NA,untruth that the honorable member for,39
NA,Wentworth has stated. He does not care,39
NA,what he says.,39
Mr HARRISON ,Th e Minister need,39
NA,not have approved of his selection.,39
Mr DEDMAN , T h e matter was not,39
NA,put to me f o r either approval or dis-,39
NA,approval. What the honorable gentleman,39
NA,has said is a plain untruth. That is all,39
NA,there is to i t . Mr Kaiser was selected,39
NA,by the executive of the Council f or,39
NA,"Scientific and Industrial Research, as",39
NA,the organization was then known.,39
Mr ANTHONY , W h e n was he selected,39
Mr DEDMAN ,Approximatel y two,39
NA,years ago. I n order that honorable,39
NA,gentlemen opposite should not have an,39
NA,opportunity to say that Mr Don Mounthoped,39
NA,"joy had any responsibility i n this matter,",39
NA,I made i t clear in this chamber that,39
NA,the time when the selection was made in this country.,39
NA,there were only four members of the,39
NA,executive of the Council for Scientific,39
NA,ancl Industrial Research and that Mr .,39
NA,Mountjoy was not one of them. Although wanted to do so.,39
NA,I went into all that detail about the matter,39
NA,"then, the honorable member f or Wentthe",39
NA,worth has stated the position i n a comdoes,39
NA,pletely false manner i n this chamber,39
NA,afternoon. He has done that knowingly,39
NA,and w i l f u l l y. The honorable gentleman,39
NA,does not care what he says as long as he,39
NA,"able, by the publicity that the press",39
NA,this country and overseas gives to his,39
NA,"statements, to bring discredit",39
NA,organization that has done a great deal,39
NA,for Australia. I also made i t clear,39
NA,this chamber that during the war M,39
NA,Kaiser was engaged upon very secret,39
NA,work. I made that statement i n order,39
NA,to show that the executive of the Council victions before - he,39
NA,for Scientific and Industrial Research,39
NA,had some justification f or selecting,39
NA,for the scholarship. Mr Kaiser was,39
NA,very brilliant student at the University,39
NA,of Melbourne. I think that he graduated,39
NA,"in 1943, and was one of the most brilliant",39
NA,students of liis year. He then undertook,39
NA,work i n the radiophysics division,39
NA,the Council f or Scientific and Industrial,39
NA,Research and made great contributions,39
NA,to the solution of certain problems that,39
NA,confronted that division i n its experi-,39
NA,mental work. Those contributions were,39
NA,of great assistance to Australia and the,39
NA,Allies i n the conduct of the war. Durin g,39
NA,the whole of the time that Mr Kaiser was,39
NA,engaged upon that valuable work there,39
NA,was never any question of his integrity.,39
NA,That is demonstrated by the fact that,39
NA,Sir Henry Tizard and certain security,39
NA,officers f r o m the United Kingdom made,39
NA,it quite clear to the Prime Minister of,39
NA,"this country, and, indeed, made public",39
NA,"statements to the same effect, that there",39
NA,was no question of any details of the,39
NA,work that had heen undertaken by the,39
NA,Council f or Scientific and Industrial,39
NA,Research being divulged to anybody.,39
NA,Mr Kaiser was a brilliant student,39
NA,? who had done very valuable work.,39
NA,The executive of the Council f or,39
NA,Scientific and Industrial Research decided,39
NA,that he was the best individual to,39
NA,send overseas f o r this purpose. I t was,39
NA,that when he returned to Australia,39
NA,he would be able to make even greater,39
NA,at contributions to scientific research work,39
Mr HARRISON ,Th e Minister could,39
NA,Don have stopped h i m f r o m going had he,39
Mr DEDMAN , I t is obvious that,39
NA,honorable member f o r Wentworth,39
NA,not know the wording of the legisla-,39
NA,"this tion. The matter was never put to me,",39
NA,and I was quite unaware that Mr Kaiser,39
NA,was going to London. U n t i l that time,39
NA,is his career had been such as to j u s t i f y,39
NA,i n the executive of the Council f or Scien-,39
NA,tific and Industrial Research i n selecting,39
NA,upon an him for the scholarship.,39
NA,The honorable member f o r Wentworth,39
NA,i n has stated that Mr Kaiser himself has,39
NA,r . said that the members of the executive,39
NA,of the Council f o r Scientific and I n -,39
NA,dustrial Research knew of his con-,39
NA,left Australia.,39
NA,That statement is completely untrue. I,39
NA,him have received a letter f r o m Sir David,39
NA,a Rivett to the effect that he and the other,39
NA,members of the executive were quite un-,39
NA,aware of Mr Kaiser's political affilia-,39
NA,tions when they selected h i m f o r the,39
NA,scholarship. Two persons have made,39
NA,of statements upon this matter. Apparently,39
NA,"Mr Kaiser had done so, although the",39
NA,lionorable gentleman has only read from,40
NA,"a newspaper report, and I have received",40
NA,a letter on the subject from Sir David,40
NA,Rivett. I know which of those two indi-,40
NA,"viduals I believe, and I know which",40
NA,of them the public will believe. Accord-,40
NA,"ing to Sir David Rivett, the executive",40
NA,of the Council for Scientific and Indus-,40
NA,trial Research was not aware of any,40
NA,affiliation that Mr Kaiser may have had,40
NA,with the Communist party before he left,40
NA,Australia. According to information,40
NA,"that I have received from London, Mr.",40
NA,Kaiser does not admit even now that he is,40
NA,"a member of the Communist party, and",40
NA,the honorable member for Wentworth has,40
NA,not produced any evidence to show that,40
NA,he was a Communist when he left Aus-,40
NA,tralia. The honorable* gentleman has,40
NA,"suggested, in effect, that the executive",40
NA,the Commonwealth Scientific and Indus-,40
NA,trial Research Organization or of any,40
NA,other body that selects people in tbis,40
NA,country for scholarships or for scientific,40
NA,research work should be gifted with fore-,40
NA,sight and should be able to foresee,40
NA,"whether a young man will, at some time",40
NA,"or other, change his political philosophy",40
NA,and become a member of the Communist,40
NA,party.,40
Mr HARRISON ,Wha t about the effecLabour,40
NA,tive screening process to which Comment,40
NA,monwealth employees are supposed to be,40
NA,subjected ?,40
Mr DEDMAN ,Th e honorable memScientific,40
NA,ber for Wentworth has suggested that,40
NA,the security screening that is undertaken,40
NA,by the Government in relation to appointthe,40
NA,ments to the Commonwealth Scientific,40
NA,and Industrial Research Organization,40
NA,and the Public Service generally is,40
NA,efficient. I remind the honorable gentleDedman),40
NA,man that Mr Kaiser has been overseas,40
NA,for the last two years and that it,40
NA,not been possible for the security authorifrom,40
NA,ties in this country to do the necessary,40
NA,work in connexion with screening him.,40
Mr FRANCIS ,Coul d not the British,40
NA,Government help us?,40
Mr HARRISON ,Th e British Governtralians.,40
NA,ment knew that Kaiser was a Commulong,40
NA,nist. That is why it would not give us,40
NA,the secrets.,40
Mr DEDMAN ,Onc e again the honventured,40
NA,orable member for Wentworth has made,40
NA,a wild statement without any evidence,40
NA,to support it. Mr Kaiser has now been,40
NA,dismissed from the Commonwealth Scien-,40
NA,tific and Industrial Research Organiza-,40
NA,tion. I can assure the committee that,40
NA,there is no individual in Australia who is,40
NA,working upon any project connected with,40
NA,security requirements who is affiliated,40
NA,with the Communist party or even has,40
NA,Communist sympathies. A l l persons,40
NA,occupying positions with which security,40
NA,matters are involved have been thoroughly,40
NA,screened.,40
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,Wh o reads,40
NA,their minds to find out where their,40
NA,sympathies lie?,40
Mr DEDMAN ,Tha t is a difficult,40
NA,task. I t is a matter for the security,40
NA,organization and not for me. I can,40
NA,of assure the committee that there is no,40
NA,danger that any person who has any sym-,40
NA,pathy for the Communist party or who is,40
NA,connected with the Communist party in,40
NA,"any way whatever is employed, in a job",40
NA,where matters of security must be taken,40
NA,into consideration.,40
Mr BERNARD CORSER ,Wide Bay),40
NA,[2.55] -Th c Government has allotted,40
NA,only 2£ hours for the consideration of,40
NA,the Estimates for the Department of,40
NA,"and National Service, the Depart-",40
NA,"of Transport, the Department of",40
NA,"Information, the Department of Post-war",40
NA,Reconstruction and the Commonwealth,40
NA,and Industrial Research Organ-,40
NA,"ization. Some honorable members, and",40
NA,particularly Ministers have monopolized,40
NA,time that has been available for the,40
NA,dissection of the Estimates of various,40
NA,"departments. This afternoon, the Minis-",40
NA,not ter for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr.,40
NA,used the same arguments as,40
NA,he employed on another occasion in,40
NA,has an endeavour to extricate himself,40
NA,"a shocking situation. A young man,",40
NA,"Mr Kaiser, who was a member of the",40
NA,staff of the Commonwealth Scientific and,40
NA,"Industrial Research Organization, parti-",40
NA,cipated in a Communist demonstration in,40
NA,"London, to the shame of all loyal Aus-",40
NA,Although the Minister made a,40
NA,"statement about the matter, he did",40
NA,"not clarify the position, and hc obviously",40
NA,became annoyed because the honorable,40
NA,member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison),40
NA,to' raise it. Instead of mono-,40
NA,polizing tbe brief period that bas,40
NA,\wv. allotted for consideration of tlie,41
NA,"Estimates for these five departments, he",41
NA,should have chosen a more appropriate,41
NA,time to endeavour to clear himself.,41
NA,"Last night, when the Estimates for other",41
NA,"departments were being considered, there",41
NA,was a similar occurrence. I keenly desired,41
NA,to speak on the proposed vote for the,41
NA,Department of Commerce and Agricul-,41
NA,"ture, and to discuss butter production and",41
NA,"cotton growing, but I was prevented from",41
NA,doing so. I notice that the Minister for,41
NA,Transport ( Mr Ward) is not in the,41
NA,chamber. He is probably hobnobbing,41
NA,with some Liberal Premier,41
Mr CONELAN ,B e fair!,41
NA,"Mr TurnbuU interjecting,",41
Mr BERNARD CORSER , I sin-,41
NA,cerely regret the unfortunate circum-,41
NA,stances that are responsible for the Min-,41
NA,"ister's absence, but I repeat my view that",41
NA,"if the circumstances were normal, he",41
NA,would probably be hobnobbing with some,41
NA,Liberal Premier discussing the standard-,41
NA,ization of railway gauges. The Minister,41
NA,is determined to pursue that policy.,41
NA,With the devaluation of the Australian,41
NA,"pound, the original estimate of the cost",41
NA,of that project has been increased from,41
NA,"£200,000,000 to £325,000,000, and higher",41
NA,costs of labour may further increase the,41
NA,"ultimate figure to £400,000,000. The",41
NA,advantages of the standardization of,41
NA,"railway gauges are questionable, and",41
NA,I consider that the money would,41
NA,be expended more wisely in pro-,41
NA,viding so many of the facilities that,41
NA,are urgently required for tbe develop-,41
NA,ment of many parts of Australia. The,41
NA,project that is envisaged by the Minister,41
NA,will replace State railway assets that have,41
NA,"already cost £600,000,000. He plans to",41
NA,"replace many of the existing railway lines,",41
NA,"locomotives and rolling stock, and he is",41
NA,eager to begin the wo'rk at a time when,41
NA,we cannot get sufficient iron and steel for,41
NA,wire netting to prevent vermin and stock,41
NA,"from dratroying our crops. At present,",41
NA,tho States are importing scores of new,41
NA,"locomol ives, and quantities of spare parts",41
NA,and rolling stock. They are unable to,41
NA,manufacture those requirements in their,41
NA,own workshops because constant strikes,41
NA,in the basic industries have reduced the,41
NA,"production of iron and steel. Last week,",41
NA,the Minister was negotiating to make,41
NA,available to the State Premiers of South,41
NA,Australia and Western Australia tens of,41
NA,millions of pounds in connexion with the,41
NA,project for the standardization of railway,41
NA,gauges. I hope that the Government will,41
NA,not proceed with that work but will expend,41
NA,at least some of the money on more,41
NA,advantageous projects.,41
NA,The limited time does not permit me,41
NA,to deal at greater length with the subject,41
NA,"of the standardization of railway gauges,",41
NA,and I now direct my remarks to the Com-,41
NA,monwealth Scientific and Industrial Re-,41
NA,search Organization. I have a high,41
NA,opinion of that body. Having been well-,41
NA,"founded, it is one of the most valuable",41
NA,institutions in the Commonwealth. The,41
NA,"staff includes many prominent scientists,",41
NA,and probably a few Communists have,41
NA,worked themselves into its organization.,41
NA,I urge the Government to increase,41
NA,the proposed vote for the Common-,41
NA,wealth Scientific and Industrial Re-,41
NA,search Organization so that it may,41
NA,investigate methods for destroying the,41
NA,pests and vermin that are doing almost,41
NA,incalculable damage in the agricultural,41
NA,and stock-raising industries. The pri-,41
NA,"mary producers of Europe, and, in par-",41
NA,"ticular, of Canada., receive wonderful",41
NA,assistance from thc application of,41
NA,"scientific methods to combating pests,",41
NA,diseases and vermin. The Commonwealth,41
NA,Scientific and Industrial Research,41
NA,Organization should be encouraged to,41
NA,devote more attention to those matters,41
NA,of practical value instead of to the,41
NA,"theoretical side, which compiles reports",41
NA,for universities and students about what,41
NA,"happens behind tbe moon, and in the",41
NA,moon. We should keep our feet on the,41
NA,earth in these matters. Whilst the Com-,41
NA,monwealth .Scientific and Industrial,41
NA,Research Organization may be justified,41
NA,in investigating the effects of gases,41
NA,"around Mars, or some other planet,",41
NA,il would render inestimable service,41
NA,to our primary industries i f i t,41
NA,were to solve the problems of the man,41
NA,ou the land. I f science could destroy the,41
NA,"pests and vermin, many of the troubles",41
NA,that beset primary producers would din-,41
NA,"appear, and young men would have a",41
NA,greater incentive to remain in the agri-,41
NA,cultural and pastoral industries. Even,41
NA,"in Soviet Russia, agricultural research",41
NA,"is well advanced, and successful experi-",42
NA,mentation has enabled special varieties,42
NA,"of fruits, wheat and potatoes, to be",42
NA,produced even in the snow-bound regions.,42
NA,Primary producers in Australia do not,42
NA,derive all possible practical advantages,42
NA,from the researches of the Oommonwealth,42
NA,Scientific and Industrial Research,42
NA,Organization. When I raised this matter,42
NA,"on a previous occasion, I pointed out",42
NA,that the Council for Scientific and,42
NA,"Industrial Research, as it was then",42
NA,"known, had complained that lack of",42
NA,money was restricting such investiga-,42
NA,tions. I hope that the grounds for,42
NA,that complaint have been removed. I,42
NA,could speak at much greater length on,42
NA,"these matters, but as I realize that other",42
NA,honorable members desire to express their,42
NA,views on the Estimates for these depart-,42
NA,"ments, I shall not prevent them from",42
NA,doing so.,42
Mr LANGTRY ,Riverina) [3.3] -,42
NA,emphasize the importance of developing,42
NA,irrigation projects in Australia. Thfc,42
NA,Commonwealth is now providing a subprimary producing industries.,42
NA,stantial sum of money for university,42
NA,"general education, and I stress the",42
NA,portance of establishing an agricultural,42
NA,college to instruct students in irrigation,42
NA,"processes. I n the past, Australians have",42
NA,wasted their limited resources of water,42
NA,because they did not understand soil con-,42
NA,"ditions. However, we are now water-",42
NA,minded. Next week His Excellency the,42
NA,Governor-General will turn the first,42
NA,to mark the beginning of *the work,42
NA,the greatest hydro-electric scheme that,42
NA,has been undertaken in the history,42
NA,"Australia, and, therefore, the time is",42
NA,opportune for the Government to consider,42
NA,the advantages of training young men,42
NA,in irrigation processes. The Minister for,42
NA,Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman),42
NA,has already done a magnificent job,42
NA,the Commonwealth re-establishment and,42
NA,"employment scheme, and it is largely to",42
NA,his credit that ex-service men and women,42
NA,have made such progress in their trainHolloway).,42
NA,ing to fit themselves for various occupaof,42
NA,"tions. I n the interests of Australia,",42
NA,some of our young men should be the,42
NA,instructed in irrigation work. Water,42
NA,conservation projects in Australia include,42
NA,"the Snowy Mountains scheme, and BurI",42
NA,"dekin Valley scheme i n Queensland, and",42
NA,a huge undertaking in Western Australia.,42
NA,I n the irrigation areas on the Murrum-,42
NA,"bidgee I have seen young orchards, just",42
NA,when they were about to come into pro-,42
NA,"duction, pulled out because the ground",42
NA,had become waterlogged. That sort of,42
NA,thing will happen again unless our young,42
NA,people are taught the proper use of water.,42
NA,I t does not matter what it costs to teach,42
NA,them; the expenditure will be well worth-,42
NA,while. We have been told that the popu-,42
NA,"lation of Australia, may be 15,000,000",42
NA,"or even 20,000,000 within a comparatively",42
NA,"few years, and it has been suggested that",42
NA,it may become necessary to import food.,42
NA,We are now on the verge of a period of,42
NA,great development in water conservation,42
NA,"projects, so that it becomes more impor-",42
NA,tant than ever that our young men should,42
NA,be taught how to use the water properly.,42
NA,I suggest that a training school should,42
NA,"be established at Yanco, in New South",42
NA,"Wales, and at suitable places in other",42
NA,States. I agree with everything the honor-,42
NA,1 able member for Wide Bay ( Mr Bernard,42
NA,Corser) said about the need to apply the,42
NA,discoveries of scientific men to the.,42
NA,The,42
NA,and scientists have done magnificent work.,42
NA,imThey have developed varieties of wheat,42
NA,that are drought and frost resistant.,42
NA,Tliere are still many problems confront-,42
NA,"ing the primary producers, and .they can",42
NA,be solved only with the help of scientists.,42
Mr WHITE ,Balaclava) [3.7] - I,42
NA,direct attention to the giant propaganda,42
NA,sod machine that has been established,42
NA,on by the Government. I t uses large,42
NA,quantities of paper that is badly needed,42
NA,of by newspapers and for the publication,42
NA,of books. Many authors find it impossible,42
NA,to have tiheir works publisbed because of,42
NA,"the shortage of paper, yet government",42
NA,departments are churning out great quan-,42
NA,"tities of propaganda, or "" blah"" books,",42
NA,with as they are called. I have one here,42
NA,entitled Ten Years of War and Peace.,42
NA,issued under the authority of the Minister,42
NA,for Labour and National Service ( Mr.,42
NA,The cover carries a picture,42
NA,"the Minister himself, looking very coy.",42
NA,One might be pardoned for thinking that,42
NA,publication discusses Australia's deve-,42
NA,"lopment; but it is, in fact, pure propa-",42
NA,"ganda for the Minister. Some time ago,",42
NA,asked what was the cost of the publica-,42
NA,"tion, and who had printed it. I n all the",42
NA,"States, there is a law which provides tbat",42
NA,publications shall bear the name of the,43
NA,printer; but this Government,43
NA,"apparently, above all law. The contents",43
NA,of tne booklet are being broadcast over the,43
NA,radio stations by Labour aspirants fo r,43
NA,political honours. The Minister has used,43
NA,public money to prin t Labour party pro-,43
NA,"paganda, wbich should have been paid for",43
NA,by the Labour party. I turned the booklet,43
NA,over to a research organization i n order to,43
NA,get an opinion on the facts presented i n i t .,43
Mr DUTHIE , A research organization,43
NA,established by the Liberal party?,43
Mr WHITE , T h e r e is a statement on,43
NA,the back page of the booklet which I refer,43
NA,tothe loquacious honorable member fo r,43
NA,"Wilmot ( Mr Duthie), who is always pre-",43
NA,pared to talk on any subject. There is an,43
NA,"old adage about ""where angels fear to",43
NA,"tread"". The honorable member w i l l",43
NA,know what I mean. I quote f r o m the,43
NA,boo-let as follows:-,43
NA,My study of economics convinces me that,43
NA,"employment makes employment, just as unem-",43
NA,ployment creates unemployment.,43
NA,I t is claimed i n the booklet that there is,43
NA,a feeling of security and general pros-,43
NA,perity i n Australia. The research orga-,43
NA,nization comments on this claim as,43
NA,follows:-,43
NA,. . . Just how secure the worker is in,43
NA,his employment was graphically illustrated,43
NA,during the recent general coal strike when the,43
NA,number of unemployed in New Soutli Wales,43
NA,and Queensland exceeded that at the height,43
NA,of the depression. Even before the strike com-,43
NA,"menced, unemployment in New South Wales",43
NA,"exceeded 250,000 because of the rains which",43
NA,occurred in tlie mining areas and the necessity,43
NA,to introduce some form of rationing of coal,43
NA,supplies so that essential services could be,43
NA,maintained for a short period. There were,43
NA,no reserves of coal.,43
NA,"There are still no reserves of coal, and",43
NA,the Government refuses to do anything,43
NA,to establish a reserve by importing coal,43
NA,lest i t might interfere with the miners',43
NA,federation. The Government does not,43
NA,"admit that as a reason, of course. The",43
NA,comment continues as follows:-,43
NA,"Prosperity, from the viewpoint of the Minis-",43
NA,"ter, is apparently synonymous with inflation,",43
NA,as the only prosperity which Australia,43
NA,possesses is a high national income unaccom-,43
NA,panied by production of those things whicli,43
NA,incoine can purchase. National income in,43
NA,"nionotarv terms has increased from £814,000,000",43
NA,"in 1938-39 to £1,915,000,000 in 1948-49, an",43
NA,increase of 135 per cent. Tn the same period,43
NA,production has increased overall only from,43
NA,5 per eent. to 10 per cent.,43
NA,But taxation has increased by 550 per,43
NA,"is, cent. I n his booklet, the Minister dis-",43
NA,cusses the Postmaster-General's Depart-,43
NA,ment. He points out that the depart-,43
NA,"ment made a profit of £3,500,000 i n 193S,",43
NA,"and of £5,103,000 i n 1947, but be does",43
NA,"not say that i n 1949, fo r the first time",43
NA,"since federation, i t w i l l operate at a",43
NA,loss. This Government does not believe,43
NA,"in the profit motive. Apparently, i t",43
NA,believes in the loss motive. Certainly i t,43
NA,is achieving losses i n the running of,43
NA,"Government airlines, as the honorable",43
NA,member f o r Flinders ( Mr Ryan) has,43
NA,pointed out. The Minister fo r Civil,43
NA,Aviation ( Mr Drakeford) has also issued,43
NA,"a booklet. I t is called Post-war Aviation,",43
NA,and i t carries a picture of the Minister,43
NA,on the cover. One would think that the,43
NA,Labour party had just discovered avia-,43
NA,tion. The honorable member f o r Flinders,43
NA,showed how the balance-sheet of the Go-,43
NA,vernment's air service had been falsified.,43
Mr CALWELL , T h a t is not true.,43
Mr WHITE , T h e Mmister f o r I n -,43
NA,formation ( Mr Calwell) has interjected.,43
NA,"Bearing the title he does, he should have",43
NA,"a high regard f o r facts; but, as .a matter",43
NA,"of fact, he should be more properly called",43
NA,"the "" Minister for Mis-information"".",43
NA,"Trans-Australia Airlines, which had the",43
NA,"benefit of £3,500,000 of capital free of",43
NA,"interest, showed a loss of over £500,000",43
NA,on the first year's operations. I have,43
NA,here another booklet which bears the,43
NA,title Homesf o r Australia. I t looks as,43
NA,i f i t had been issued by a prosperous,43
NA,publishing house. But i t is sheer propa-,43
NA,ganda by the Government that should be,43
NA,paid for out of the Labour party's funds,43
NA,and not by the people of Australia.,43
NA,Another booklet was referred to by the,43
NA,right honorable member for N o r t h,43
NA,Sydney ( Mr Hughes). I t deals with,43
NA,immigration. I do not detract f r o m what,43
NA,the Minister for Immigration ( Mr .,43
NA,Calwell) has done. He has done a good,43
NA,job i n some respects. He is following the,43
NA,lead set by the previous government. We,43
NA,have a refugee scheme and a nomination,43
NA,sclieme. The Minister is doing well i n,43
NA,"regard to displaced persons, but a new",43
NA,phase has arisen regarding British immi-,43
NA,gration. Nominators of British migrants,43
NA,are running out. Many who would like to,43
NA,come to Australia f r o m Great Britain,43
NA,cannot come because they cannot get any,44
NA,one to nominate them. I should like to,44
NA,see a chapter in the Minister's next,44
NA,booklet about what the Government in-,44
NA,tends to do about the immigration of,44
NA,British subjects.,44
Mr CALWELL ,Tha t will come next,44
NA,year.,44
Mr WHITE,Nex t year?,44
NA,honorable gentleman will not be responwill be petty despots again.,44
NA,sible for immigration matters then.,44
NA,succeeding government will have,44
NA,responsibility. The Minister has,44
NA,great opportunities to bring British,44
NA,migrants to Australia. Another governpurpose,44
NA,ment publication is issued by the Departevery,44
NA,ment of Commerce and Agriculture. I,44
NA,tells merchants where they can sell their,44
NA,goods. I am confident that merchants,44
NA,are more aware of markets for tbeir goods,44
NA,than any officials in Canberra could be.,44
NA,Another publication comes from the they,44
NA,"Department of Post-war Reconstruction,",44
NA,which is administered by the Minister,44
NA,Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman).,44
NA,In that publication he does not tell about,44
NA,the thousands of ex-servicemen who did,44
NA,not receive the vocational training that,44
NA,"they were promised, because a Communist",44
NA,union boss named Bulmer decided that,44
NA,the industry in which they were to have,44
NA,been trained had reached saturation,44
NA,point and that no more ex-servicemen zations.,44
NA,were needed for training in it. So those,44
NA,ex-servicemen remained unskilled. Honmore,44
NA,orable gentlemen opposite know how true,44
NA,"that is, because the honorable member",44
NA,for Moreton ( Mr Francis) has given the,44
NA,facts and the figures. Members of the,44
NA,Government are claiming that they have,44
NA,"clone well by Australia, whereas they",44
NA,know that Australia's prosperity to-day,44
NA,results from the fortuitous circumshould,44
NA,stances of high prices for our exports.,44
NA,"Should those prices collapse, as they well",44
NA,"may, the succeeding government will have",44
NA,to adjust the difficulties. I object,44
NA,unethical way in which the Government,44
NA,is pouring out propaganda at the expense,44
NA,of the taxpayers. The Minister for unfair and unsound.,44
NA,Immigration blandly smiles. He thinks,44
NA,it is all in the game. Looking after the,44
NA,"people's money is not a game, but a",44
NA,trusteeship that should be taken seriously.,44
NA,Another instance of the unethical attitude,44
NA,of the Government was provided in the,44
NA,admission of the Minister for Informafor,44
NA,tion that the cost of the Government's,44
NA,propaganda in connexion with a recent,44
NA,referendum were met from the vote,44
NA,for Post-war Education. The Go-,44
NA,vernment is soft-pedalling on socialism,44
NA,these days. I t is concentrating on issuing,44
NA,booklets designed to tell the people what,44
NA,splendid men the Commonwealth Minis-,44
NA,ters are. I f those gentlemen get,44
NA,"The by in the general election, they",44
NA,The,44
NA,The Commonwealth Electoral Act provides,44
NA,that that no honorable members shall,44
NA,lost make certain payments within three,44
NA,months of the general election with a,44
NA,of ensuring their re-election. Yet,44
NA,Cabinet Minister is shooting out,44
NA,t sheaves of booklets that have that very,44
NA,purpose. I refer also to the booklet deal-,44
NA,"ing with social services. Last week, I",44
NA,asked how many copies of the booklet had,44
NA,"been ordered, what they had cost, and why",44
NA,were finding their way into the offices,44
NA,of trade unions. I also asked whether,44
NA,for any more copies were to be ordered. I,44
NA,"was told that 500,000 had been ordered",44
NA,"and that their cost was £8,000 and that",44
NA,"anotlier 500,000, which would also cost",44
NA,"£8,000, had been ordered. The gist of the",44
NA,reply to a question about the booklets,44
NA,having found their way into the hands of,44
NA,"Labour organizations was: "" We did not",44
NA,deliberately send them to Labour organi-,44
NA,I f they stamp ' Vote Labour ' all,44
NA,"over them, that is their business "". I t is",44
NA,than their business; it is the business,44
NA,of the Parliament to ensure that this sort,44
NA,of thing should be stopped. Government,44
NA,propaganda has poured from the printing,44
NA,presses for the eight years in which,44
NA,"Labour has been in office. Now, we are",44
NA,experiencing a spate of similar propa-,44
NA,ganda before the general election. I t,44
NA,be stopped and it certainly should,44
NA,not be paid for by the people.,44
Mr BEAZLEY ,Fremantle) [3.19] -,44
NA,to the The honorable member for Balaclava,44
NA,( Mr White) has referred to certain,44
NA,publications. His references were most,44
Mr WHITE ,I n what way?,44
Mr BEAZLEY , I am going to dis-,44
NA,cuss that. The honorable gentleman made,44
NA,a specific reference to a recent publication,44
NA,issued under the authority of the Minister,44
NA,Works and Housing ( Mr Lemmon),44
NA,entitled Homes for Australia. That pub-,45
NA,lication makes it perfectly clear that hous-,45
NA,in i is tho joint responsibility of the Aus-,45
NA,tmlian Government and the State,45
NA,governments. The reference in it to,45
NA,housing in Western Australia makes it,45
NA,clear that housing in that State,45
NA,is under the direct administration,45
NA,of tbe State Government. No claim,45
NA,is made about the part played by,45
NA,the Australian Government in that,45
NA,"State, other than that it makes a finan-",45
NA,"cial contribution, which is a perfectly",45
NA,"tr-aid ful statement. Actually, that",45
NA,material could be regarded as propaganda,45
NA,for the State Government. I t is factual,45
NA,information and has no regard for poli-,45
NA,tical complexions. The honorable mem-,45
NA,ber said that the booklet on social,45
NA,services was Labour party propaganda.,45
NA,Let us look at this alleged propaganda.,45
NA,On page 7 of the booklet it states-,45
NA,In that year the Scullin Government reduced,45
NA,"the allowance to £4, and introduced a means",45
NA,test as to iiiconre.,45
NA,"Is it "" good propaganda"" for the",45
NA,Labour party to talk about reducing,45
NA,social services ? The booklet gives a truly,45
NA,objective picture of the age pension. Then,45
NA,it says-,45
NA,Child endowment was introduced by the,45
NA,Menzies Government. Payments commenced,45
NA,"in July, 1941, at the rate of 5s. a week.",45
NA,I t traces the whole history of child endow-,45
NA,ment in a factual manner. That is also,45
NA,"true of unemployment benefit, sickness",45
NA,"benefit, widows' pensions and so on.",45
NA,There are certain sections in the,45
NA,booklet that show that widows' pen-,45
NA,sions and certain other social services,45
NA,came into being under the Labour,45
NA,Government. That is fact. As honorable,45
NA,"members opposite know, a great many",45
NA,social services have been introduced in the,45
NA,eight years of the existence of the Labour,45
NA,Government. To say that is simply to,45
NA,speak the truth. The booklet cannot be,45
NA,regarded as propaganda in favour of any,45
NA,political party. I t gives the historical,45
NA,background of social services. I t explains,45
NA,the means tost. No one could regard an,45
NA,explanation of the means test as good pro-,45
NA,paganda for the Labour party.,45
NA,The honorable member for Wentworth,45
NA,( Mr Harrison) was again happy in his,45
NA,role of cloak-and-dagger expert for the,45
NA,Mr Beazley.,45
NA,Opposition when he found out that a,45
NA,gentleman named Kaiser had been sys-,45
NA,tematically betraying secrets. He implied,45
NA,that the secrets' of the Australian Govern-,45
NA,ment had been betrayed by Kaiser to a,45
NA,foreign country. I have to agree with the,45
NA,honorable gentleman that one must infer,45
NA,from Kaiser's demonstration in front of,45
NA,Australia House over the coal strike that,45
NA,he is a Communist. There is no,45
NA,sense in quibbling about that. Whether,45
NA,or not it can be proved that he is a Com-,45
NA,"munist, I do not know. All I know is that",45
NA,no section of the community other than,45
NA,the Communists disapproved of the Go-,45
NA,vernment's actions in connexion with,45
NA,"the coal strike. My point, how-",45
NA,"ever, is that while in the Tjnited",45
NA,"Kingdom, Kaiser worked in British insti-",45
NA,tutions. No evidence has been produced,45
NA,by tbe honorable member for Wentworth,45
NA,that those institutions were dealing with,45
NA,"anything secret. But, i f they were, and",45
NA,"he was betraying the secret details, he",45
NA,should have come under the surveillance,45
NA,of the British Intelligence Service. We,45
NA,"know certain people who, ih Australia",45
NA,"during the war, were not prosecuted but",45
NA,"who, immediately they reached the United",45
NA,"Kingdom, were arrested. One of them",45
NA,was a gentleman on whose behalf honor-,45
NA,able members opposite were vocal recently.,45
NA,He would be well advised to keep away,45
NA,from the United Kingdom. The fact is,45
NA,that if tliere were any real evidence con-,45
NA,cerning subversive activities by Kaiser,45
NA,he would be arrested in Britain and,45
NA,charged in that country with the offences,45
NA,"alleged, because such activities would",45
NA,have taken place in British scientific,45
NA,institutions. I t is fantastic to suggest,45
NA,that while Kaiser is resident in Britain,45
NA,he is under the jurisdiction of the Minis-,45
NA,ter for Defence ( Mr Dedman). I do not,45
NA,wish to deal with that subject at any,45
NA,great length.,45
NA,I desire to ask the Minister for some,45
NA,information concerning several aspects,45
NA,of the proposed vote for the Common-,45
NA,wealth Scientific and Industrial Research,45
NA,Organization. The honorable member for,45
NA,Wide Bay ( Mr Bernard Corser) criti-,45
NA,cized the proposed expenditure for,45
NA,scientific and industrial research.,45
Mr BERNARD CORSER ,I ' wanted a,45
NA,greater expenditure.,45
Mr BEAZLEY ,Th e honorable mem-,46
NA,ber criticized the allocation of the expen-,46
NA,diture. He complained that not enough,46
NA,was to be expended on scientific research,46
NA,connected with primary industries. The,46
NA,present Minister for Defence has so far,46
NA,eclipsed the record of governments that,46
NA,thc honorable member for Wide Bay sup-,46
NA,"ported, and supported apparently un-",46
NA,"critically, that the honorable member",46
NA,made no reference to his achievements.,46
NA,"Under the present Minister, expenditure",46
NA,on scientific research has risen from,46
NA,"£339,000 a year to more than £2,000,000",46
NA,a year. The honorable member for Wide,46
NA,Bay made absurd claims about expendi-,46
NA,ture on astronomy and made fantastic,46
NA,statements about other research work,46
NA,which is not actually carried out. He,46
NA,will find that the heaviest items of ex-,46
NA,penditure under this division concern,46
NA,"plant industry, soils and irrigation,",46
NA,products and other activities connected,46
NA,"with agriculture. Plant industry, animal",46
NA,health and production account for pro-,46
NA,"posed expenditures of more than £200,000",46
NA,each. Proposed expenditure under item,46
NA,"6 of Division 113, relating to forest",46
NA,"products, is given as £142,600.",46
NA,In presenting these Estimates the Min-,46
NA,ister has not explained at any great,46
NA,length the expenditure proposed under,46
NA,"item 16, section C, of Division 113,",46
NA,""" Biochemistry and general nutrition "".",46
NA,That item apparently refers to an ac-,46
NA,tivity distinct from animal nutrition. I,46
NA,ask the Minister i f his department is,46
NA,taking over research into human nutri-,46
NA,tion and biochemistry. There have been,46
NA,references in scientific journals for some,46
NA,time to a new line of research in con-,46
NA,nexion with the growth of food crops in,46
NA,tbeir relation to human nutrition.,46
NA,"Tn the past, emphasis has been",46
NA,placed on wheat and plant breeding and,46
NA,upon prolificity and milling qualities of,46
NA,"grain. I n the United States of America,",46
NA,"which leads the world in such research,",46
NA,the emphasis is now upon vitamins and,46
NA,the nutritional content of plants. Some,46
NA,rather remarkable results have been an-,46
NA,nounced by various universities in the,46
NA,United States. I should like to know to,46
NA,"what, degree, if any, these lines of",46
NA,research are being pursued by the Com-,46
NA,monwealth Scientific and Industrial Re-,46
NA,search Organization.,46
NA,Item 8 of section C of Division 113,46
NA,concerns radio research. I should like,46
NA,the Minister to explain whether the Com-,46
NA,monwealth Scientific and Industrial Re-,46
NA,search Organization is engaging in any,46
NA,"research in relation to television, or",46
NA,whether the radio research mentioned,46
NA,refers only to research in connexion with,46
NA,Australian present radio facilities.,46
NA,The Estimates indicate some analysis of,46
NA,research into food preservation and trans-,46
NA,port. Can the Minister say whether any,46
NA,research is taking place into the claims,46
NA,"made on behalf of patent medicines, also",46
NA,into the claims that are advanced by the,46
NA,sellers of certain foodstuffs and certain,46
NA,tonics ? We very badly need an objective,46
NA,analysis to be made of many such claims.,46
NA,Many of the industries upon the products,46
NA,of which the public spends many,46
NA,hundreds of thousands of pounds,46
NA,foTest annually are regarded by doctors as,46
NA,being engaged in lines of manufacture,46
NA,that amount to absolute quackery. I t,46
NA,seems to me that some research should be,46
NA,"made regarding such claims, and also",46
NA,that consideration should be given to the,46
NA,"advisability of requesting the States,",46
NA,under whose jurisdiction this matter,46
NA,"comes, to enact legislation to prohibit",46
NA,"advertisements based on falsehoods, in",46
NA,cases where it has been established by,46
NA,research that the claims made in such,46
NA,advertisements are bogus.,46
NA,Item 24 concerns fuel research. No,46
NA,"doubt, during the recent coal strike, many",46
NA,honorahle members received a brochure,46
NA,from a gentleman who claimed to have a,46
NA,process whereby coal could be burned with,46
NA,much greater efficiency and with much,46
NA,greater utilization of its heating qualities,46
NA,than is the case at present. He called it,46
NA,"the ""Anderson Process for Smokeless",46
NA,"Fuel"". I should like to know whether",46
NA,that claim was investigated. The gentle-,46
NA,man concerned asked for an analysis of,46
NA,his claims. There are many countries of,46
NA,"the world where such a claim would, I",46
NA,"am sure, receive some kind of public",46
NA,attention. I should like to know whether,46
NA,the Commonwealth Scientific and Indus-,46
NA,"trial Research Organization, which",46
NA,carries out tests for the manufacturers,46
NA,"of tractors and other machinery, would",46
NA,also carry out tests into this man's claims,46
NA,"which are either outrageous, or, if true,",46
NA,mean that he has discovered a process,46
NA,the value of which is important enough,47
NA,to be investigated.,47
NA,Items 1 and 2 of section D of Division,47
NA,113 refer to the provision of a total of,47
NA,"£31,120 for research associations and",47
NA,research studentships. I should like to,47
NA,know how much of this amount is to be,47
NA,directed towards the tenure of scholar-,47
NA,"ships in Britain. ""We have a British",47
NA,fixation regarding many of our overseas,47
NA,"scholarships, regardless of the fact that",47
NA,the initiative in many lines of scientific,47
NA,"research has gone from Britain, which",47
NA,undoubtedly led in that respect during,47
NA,"the nineteenth century, to the United",47
NA,States. I sliould like the Minister to give,47
NA,the committee some information on how,47
NA,much is to be made available notwith-,47
NA,standing dollar differences for the tenure,47
NA,of scholarships in the United States. An,47
NA,extremely open attitude is displayed by,47
NA,the United States in respect of all lines,47
NA,"of scientific research, despite the fact",47
NA,we are always hearing from honorable,47
NA,members opposite about how that country,47
NA,is keeping scientific developments secret,47
NA,as far as Australia is concerned.,47
NA,"Item 20, section C, shows that it",47
NA,"is proposed to spend £33,000 on",47
NA,"research into nuclear energy, the very",47
NA,"field in which, according to the Opposi-",47
NA,"tion, the United States is most con-",47
NA,cerned with secrecy. The Commonwealth,47
NA,could well send students to the United,47
NA,States. It is suggested by honorable,47
NA,members opposite that such students,47
NA,would be denied access to information,47
NA,concerning American research on nuclear,47
NA,energy. I draw the attention of honor-,47
NA,able members opposite to the activities of,47
NA,"General Eisenhower, the former Com-",47
NA,mander-in-Chief of the United States,47
NA,"Army during the last war, who is now",47
NA,president of Columbia University in the,47
NA,United States of America. The United,47
NA,States Government offered that university,47
NA,a grant of millions of dollars for research,47
NA,in atomic energy. Because of the urging,47
NA,"of ite president, Columbia University",47
NA,refused to accept any money from the,47
NA,United States Government for that pur-,47
NA,pose. General Eisenhower urged that,47
NA,tbe offer be rejected on the ground that if,47
NA,the university accepted money from the,47
NA,United States Government for atomic,47
NA,energy research it would be obliged to,47
NA,impose secrecy upon the men engaged at,47
NA,Ur. Beazley.,47
NA,that university in such research.,47
NA,Columbia University has the use of many,47
NA,millions of dollars from private funds,47
NA,and also has an unrivalled laboratory,47
NA,"which, in fact, carried out much of the",47
NA,research that resulted in the production,47
NA,of the atomic bomb. So 1 stress that,47
NA,atomic research at the Columbia Uni-,47
NA,"versity, the president of which was",47
NA,Commander-in-Chief of the United States,47
NA,"Army during the last war, is carried out",47
NA,under conditions of a complete absence,47
NA,of secrecy.,47
Mr GULLETT ,Nonsense !,47
Mr BEAZLEY , I repeat that,47
NA,General Eisenhower urged Columbia,47
NA,University to refuse to accept the offer,47
NA,of that money from the United States,47
NA,Government because he was determined,47
NA,that there should be no secrecy regarding,47
NA,atomic research conducted at the uni-,47
NA,versity. I am glad to hear the honorable,47
NA,that member for Henty ( Mr Gullett) say,47
NA,""" nonsense"". I shall be very pleased",47
NA,to present him with a copy of a speech,47
NA,by General Eisenhower in which he,47
NA,refused to accept government money so,47
NA,that there should be no ties imposed on,47
NA,research in the university of which he is,47
NA,president.,47
NA,"Opposition members interjecting,",47
Mr BEAZLEY , I do not have to,47
NA,defend General Eisenhower. I neither,47
NA,apologize for him nor do I condemn him.,47
NA,I merely state the facts. Honorable,47
NA,members opposite may criticize his atti-,47
NA,tude later if they desire to do so.,47
Mr BLAIN ,Th e honorable member is,47
NA,implying,47
Mr BEAZLEY , I am not implying,47
NA,anything. I am merely stating that,47
NA,General Eisenhower refused to accept,47
NA,nioney from the Government of the,47
NA,United States of America i f the accept-,47
NA,ance of such nioney involved a promise,47
NA,that secrecy would be preserved in rela-,47
NA,tion to any research work under-,47
NA,taken as fhe result of its provision.,47
NA,Honorable members opposite may con-,47
NA,demn that attitude i f they wish to do so.,47
NA,I am not responsible for General,47
NA,Eisenhower's actions.,47
NA,The Commonwealth Scientific and I n -,47
NA,dustrial Research Organization is con-,47
NA,ducting research work into tbe building,47
NA,industry in Sydney. I n the course of that,47
NA,research work a number of tests have been,48
NA,made. I should like the Minister to in-,48
NA,form me what has been the result of this,48
NA,work and how far the results of it have,48
NA,been applied to the building industry.,48
NA,"""When I first visited the research estab-",48
NA,lishment in 1945 I observed that the,48
NA,officers there were engaged on problems,48
NA,"relating to insulation, including the build-",48
NA,ing of houses with flimsy materials which,48
NA,would keep them cool under very hot,48
NA,climatic conditions. Have any conclusions,48
NA,been reached as the result of this research,48
NA,"work, and i f so, how have they been",48
NA,applied to the building industry ?,48
Mr DEDMAN ,Corio-Ministe r for,48
NA,Defence and Minister for Post-war Reconofficers.,48
NA,struction) [3.37] - I think that it is best,48
NA,for Ministers to answer various points,48
NA,as they are raised during the debate.,48
Mr ANTHONY ,An d thus take up a,48
NA,great deal of the time available to the,48
NA,committee.,48
Mr DEDMAN ,Unles s the course I stituents,48
NA,"indicate is followed, there might be",48
NA,"an accumulation of matters that, towards",48
NA,thc end of the period devoted to the,48
NA,"sideration of these Estimates, i t may be producers.",48
NA,impossible for Ministers to give the infor-,48
NA,mation sought. The honorable member,48
NA,for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) has asked,48
NA,whether anything is being done in relation,48
NA,to investigations into the manufacture,48
NA,of tractors and the testing of tractor,48
NA,"equipment. Under Division 183, item 5,",48
NA,"amount of £7,600 has been provided, some",48
NA,of which will be used to subsidize,48
NA,on standards of equipment generally.,48
NA,Tractors will be included under that item.,48
NA,The honorable member has also asked,48
NA,vhether the. Commonwealth Scientific,48
NA,Industrial Research Organization is,48
NA,undertaking any investigations in relaparliaments.,48
NA,tion to human nutrition. The Common-,48
NA,wealth Scientific and Industrial Research,48
NA,"Organization, and the Council for Scienwould",48
NA,tific and Industrial Research before,48
NA,have not undertaken any medical research,48
NA,work.,48
Mr BEAZLEY , I had in mind research,48
NA,into the nutritional value of plants.,48
Mr DEDMAN ,Th e Commonwealth,48
NA,Scientific and Industrial Research Organthe,48
NA,ization is doing a very great deal of,48
NA,in that connexion. I t has introduced,48
NA,number of plants into Australia from,48
NA,other countries and it is undertaking,48
NA,experimental work to ascertain the nutri-,48
NA,tional value of certain plant constituents.,48
NA,A great deal of valuable work along those,48
NA,lines has been undertaken at the experi-,48
NA,mental research station near Rockhamp-,48
NA,"ton, in Queensland.",48
Mr BLAIN ,Wil l the Minister ask,48
NA,the research officers to ascertain whether,48
NA,the product known as Bovril is a useless,48
NA,article because vitamins A and B cannot,48
NA,be dissolved?,48
Mr DEDMAN ,Tha t is a problem,48
NA,for examination not by the Common-,48
NA,wealth Scientific and Industrial Research,48
NA,"Organization, but by medical research",48
NA,The Commonwealth Scientific,48
NA,and Industrial Research Organization has,48
NA,not undertaken any medical research,48
NA,"work. I t does, however, undertake",48
NA,investigations of the chemical composi-,48
NA,tion of foods and of any alterations that,48
NA,may take place in the chemical con-,48
NA,of foods as the result of process-,48
NA,such ing and marketing. Research work,48
NA,"along those lines is, of course, undertaken",48
NA,conprincipally for the benefit of primary,48
NA,The honorable member for Fremantle,48
NA,has also asked whether anything is being,48
NA,done to investigate the contents of patent,48
NA,medicines. The Commonwealth Scientific,48
NA,and Industrial Research Organization is,48
NA,"not doing anything in that regard,",48
NA,an principally hecause the Commonwealth,48
NA,has no constitutional power in relation,48
NA,research to patent medicines generally.,48
Mr BEAZLEY , I suggested that the,48
NA,Commonwealth authorities might submit,48
NA,their findings to the States for examina-,48
NA,and tion with a view to the submission of,48
NA,appropriate legislation in the State,48
Mr DEDMAN ,Th e Commonwealth,48
NA,need to be assured that the State,48
NA,"it, governments would be prepared to take",48
NA,some action before i t authorized any such,48
NA,investigations. There is quite a history,48
NA,behind this subject. At one period,48
NA,during the war a regulation was promul-,48
NA,gated which compelled the manufac-,48
NA,turers of patent medicines to submit to,48
NA,Commonwealth authorities an analysis,48
NA,work of the contents of all such medicines.,48
NA,a Some very interesting facts emerged as,48
NA,the result of the promulgation of that,48
NA,regulation. I agree that it would be of,49
NA,benefit to the community if some authority,49
NA,undertook such investigational work. The,49
NA,regulation to which I have referred was,49
NA,disallowed by the Parliament after it,49
NA,"had operated for only a short period, and",49
NA,the Commonwealth did nothing further,49
NA,about the matter. I f representations,49
NA,were made by the State governments that,49
NA,they were interested in this subject and,49
NA,that they believed that in the public,49
NA,interests investigations sbould be made,49
NA,"into the contents of patent medicines,",49
NA,with a view to ascertaining whether they,49
NA,were really efficacious for the purposes,49
NA,"for which they are advertised, the Com-",49
NA,monwealth would gladly co-operate,49
NA,through the instrumentality of the Com-,49
NA,monwealth Scientific and Industrial Re-,49
NA,"search Organization. However, until sucb",49
NA,time as the governments that have con-,49
NA,stitutional power over this matter show,49
NA,"some interest in it, I do not think that",49
NA,the Oommonwealth Scientific and Indus-,49
NA,trial Research Organization should be,49
NA,asked to undertake such investigations.,49
NA,The honorable member for Fremantle,49
NA,has also asked whether any allocations of,49
NA,nioney have been made for scholarships in,49
NA,"the United States of America, and, if so,",49
NA,what amounts had been made available,49
NA,for that purpose. No specific funds have,49
NA,been allocated for that purpose. From,49
NA,time to time the executive of the Com-,49
NA,monwealth Scientific and Industrial Re-,49
NA,search Organization makes recommenda-,49
NA,tions to me that particular individuals,49
NA,should be sent to the United States of,49
NA,America to investigate certain problems.,49
NA,The executive also makes recommenda-,49
NA,tions that individuals in the United,49
NA,States of America who have particular,49
NA,knowledge of specified subjects should be,49
NA,asked to visit Australia to assist us in the,49
NA,solution of our problems. Each of these,49
NA,recommendations is investigated on its,49
NA,merits. If it ie thought that a scholar-,49
NA,ship in a particular subject would benefit,49
NA,this country only if the student went to,49
NA,"the United States, the recommendation",49
NA,is approved subject to a very thorough,49
NA,examination being made to ascertain,49
NA,whether the student concerned could not,49
NA,obtain the desired knowledge and train-,49
NA,ing in some soft currency country. The,49
NA,same principle applies to recommenda-,49
NA,tions made to me by the executive of the,49
NA,i f r . Dedman.,49
NA,organization in relation to proposals to,49
NA,invite American specialists to this coun-,49
NA,try. Not long ago a recommendation was,49
NA,made to me that an American expert in,49
NA,"the science of genetics, Professor Lush,",49
NA,should be invited to visit this country. I,49
NA,asked whether it would not be possible,49
NA,to obtain the services of an expert from,49
NA,the United Kingdom who would be,49
NA,equally as reliable as Professor Lush. I,49
NA,was informed that the only individual,49
NA,in the United Kingdom who had the,49
NA,specialized knowledge which the organi-,49
NA,zation wanted to impart to our own,49
NA,people who are interested in this matter,49
NA,was not available to pay a visit to Aus-,49
NA,"tralia. I n those circumstances, I",49
NA,approved of the recommendation that,49
NA,Professor Lush should be brought from,49
NA,America. Professor Lush subsequently,49
NA,visited Australia and I understand that,49
NA,the information which he imparted to our,49
NA,people who were engaged in the study,49
NA,of both animal and plant genetics has,49
NA,been of very great value to the organiza-,49
NA,tion. I believe that I have dealt with all,49
NA,the matters that were raised by the hon-,49
NA,orable member for Fremantle. I f I have,49
NA,overlooked any matter I shall be glad to,49
NA,furnish what information I have about it,49
NA,at a later stage.,49
Mr ANTHONY ,Richmond) [3.46] -,49
NA,I was very interested in the speech made,49
NA,by the honorable member for Fremantle,49
NA,( Mr Beazley). When the honorable,49
NA,gentleman first came into this Parlia-,49
NA,"ment we gave him credit for inexperience,",49
NA,but we also gave him credit for intellec-,49
NA,"tual honesty. However, during the brief",49
NA,period of his membership of the Parlia-,49
NA,ment he has shown,49
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ,,49
NA,( Mr Lazzarini) -Order ! The honorable,49
NA,member must deal with the Estimates,49
NA,now under consideration.,49
Mr ANTHONY ,T o show how the,49
NA,honorable member's intellectual honesty,49
NA,"has deteriorated, I mention the fact that",49
NA,"he referred to a booklet which, he said,",49
NA,had been issued by the Department of,49
NA,Labour and National Service. He went,49
NA,on to say that the booklet was so impartial,49
NA,that any government should be prepared,49
NA,"to authorize its publication. However,",49
NA,he neglected to mention that in the fore-,49
NA,"word to the booklet, which was written",49
NA,"by tbe Prime Minister ( Mr Chifley), the",50
NA,following statement appears:-,50
NA,"Even when Australia was in the grip of war,",50
NA,"tlie then Prime Minister, Mr Curtin, agreed",50
NA,with me that social security in the post-war,50
NA,era demanded a comprehensive social services,50
NA,programme. We felt that the misery and,50
NA,hardship of past years were things which,50
NA,Australia should never have to endure again.,50
Mr CALWELL ,Wha t is w r o n g,50
NA,that?,50
Mr ANTHONY ,Ever y line of it is,50
NA,Labour propaganda. Notwithstanding,50
NA,"that fact, the honorable member for Fre-",50
NA,mantle endeavoured to persuade himself,50
NA,nnd those who may have been listening to,50
NA,his speech that this booklet is a straight-,50
NA,forward document and that thousands of,50
NA,copies of it should be printed at the ex-,50
NA,"pense, not of the Australian Labour",50
NA,"party, but of the public. I understand",50
NA,"that 1,000,000 copies of tbe booklet are",50
NA,on order with the printers. Apart,50
NA,"from that, I want to show how",50
NA,the Australian Labour party has,50
NA,debased this booklet. A copy of the book-,50
NA,let which has been handed to me by the,50
NA,honorable niember for Swan ( Mr.,50
NA,"Hamilton) who, like the honorable mem-",50
NA,"ber for Fremantle, comes from. Western",50
NA,"Australia, has plastered all over it the",50
NA,"words, "" Vote Labour. Webb for Swan "".",50
NA,We have been told that this booklet is not,50
NA,"a propaganda document, that its printing",50
NA,involves a reasonable expenditure of go-,50
NA,"vernment money, and that its contents",50
NA,would be endorsed by every right-thinking,50
NA,and fair individual in the community.,50
NA,Apparently the honorable member for,50
NA,Fremantle has slipped very greatly in the,50
NA,three short years of his membership of,50
NA,this Parliament.,50
NA,The honorable member invoked the,50
NA,"name of General Eisenhower, saying",50
NA,"that, as president of the Columbia",50
NA,"University, that distinguished gentle-",50
NA,man had refused to accept funds from,50
NA,the United States Government for use by,50
NA,the university i f such acceptance involved,50
NA,a. promise of secrecy in relation to any,50
NA,research work undertaken by the uni-,50
NA,versity. Those are not the facts. The,50
NA,honorable member for Fremantle deli-,50
NA,berately clouded the issue. I n ' the,50
NA,"Melbourne Herald of the 6th June, 1949.",50
NA,the following paragraph appeared:-,50
NA,"WASHINGTON, Wednesday -Twent y lending",50
NA,"educationists, including General Eisenhower,",50
NA,"President of tlie Columbia University, and",50
NA,"Mr James B. Conant, President of Harvard,",50
NA,said to-day that Communists should be barred,50
NA,froi.i the teaching profession . . . I t is,50
NA,because members of the Communist party are,50
NA,required to surrender the right to think for,50
NA,themselves as a consequence of becoming part,50
NA,of a movement characterized by conspiracy,50
NA,and calculated deceit that they should be,50
NA,excluded from employment as teachers.,50
NA,w i t h Although the honorable member for Fre-,50
NA,mantle invoked the name of General,50
NA,"Eisenhower., he omitted to mention those",50
NA,"facts, of which I presume he was aware.",50
NA,The honorable gentleman spoke of,50
NA,young Kaiser. The Minister for Post-,50
NA,war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) has,50
NA,frequently assured the Parliament and the,50
NA,country that there is no need for us to,50
NA,worry about Communists in Australia,50
NA,having access to information about secret,50
NA,"projects, and in his speech to-day he has",50
NA,given the committee assurance after,50
NA,assurance to that effect. He has said,50
NA,"that we need not worry, because the",50
NA,screening authorities in Australia are so,50
NA,perfect and efficient that a Communist,50
NA,could not possibly get through the net.,50
NA,"I t required Mr Kaiser himself, at a",50
NA,"demonstration in London, to indicate that",50
NA,he had Communist sympathies. The,50
NA,assurances that the Minister gave us,50
NA,"months ago, long before tbat demonstra-",50
NA,"tion occurred, have proved to be of no",50
NA,more value than other assurances that he,50
NA,has given us from time to time. The,50
NA,Minister's reputation in the Parlia-,50
NA,ment is such that we on this side,50
NA,of the chamber cannot accept any assur-,50
NA,ance that he gives unless it is accom-,50
NA,panied by documents that place the matter,50
NA,beyond any doubt. Although we have,50
NA,been told from time to time that there,50
NA,are no Communists in the employment,50
NA,of the Commonwealth Scientific and,50
NA,"Industrial Research Organization, or",50
NA,the Council for Scientific and I n -,50
NA,dustrial Research as it was known,50
NA,"at one time, they have come to light. I",50
NA,"shall name one Communist, of whom the",50
NA,"Minister has some knowledge, who was",50
NA,employed by the Council for Scientific,50
NA,and Industrial Research. I refer to the,50
NA,"notorious Mr Rudkin, who was convicted",50
NA,during the war of treason. He endea-,50
NA,voured to impart military information to,50
NA,a foreign power. He served a term of,50
NA,six months imprisonment in a West Aus-,50
NA,"tralian prison during the war, and after",50
NA,"his release he was appointed, under the",51
NA,authority of the Minister for Post-war,51
NA,"Reconstruction, to an important position",51
NA,in the Council for Scientific and Indus-,51
NA,trial Research. The Minister defended,51
NA,that appointment on every occasion when,51
NA,the matter was raised in the Parliament.,51
NA,He argued that Mr Rudkin was employed,51
NA,iu the forestry division of the Council,51
NA,Scientific and Industrial Research and,51
NA,that he could not in such employment,51
NA,possibly obtain ' information . about,51
NA,secret work. The Minister may not be,51
NA,aware that Mr Rudkin has been endea-,51
NA,vouring to secure employment in the,51
NA,physics laboratory of the University of,51
NA,Melbourne. I n his application for em-,51
NA,ployment he has doubtless referred to the,51
NA,fact that he was approved by the Council,51
NA,for Scientific and Industrial Research. I,51
NA,shall say no more upon that subject.,51
NA,Although the Minister told us that he has,51
NA,not approved of the appointment of Com-,51
NA,"munists, we have found Communists",51
NA,popping up in the departments for which,51
NA,he is responsible. The honorable gentle-,51
NA,man told us that the noted Dr Atcherley,51
NA,"was not a Communist, but the bonorable",51
NA,member for Reid ( Mr Lang) produced,51
NA,evidence which showed that he was the,51
NA,secretary of the Canberra branch of the,51
NA,Communist party.,51
Mr DEDMAN ,Doe s the honorable,51
NA,member for Richmond ( Mr Anthony),51
NA,suggest that Dr Atcherley was employed,51
NA,by the Council for Scientific and IndusCommunist,51
NA,trial Research?,51
Mr ANTHONY , I do not say that,51
NA,he was employed by that organization.,51
NA,say that the Minister repudiated the sugis,51
NA,gestion of the honorable member for Reid,51
NA,that Dr Atcherley was a Communist and,51
NA,endeavoured to prove that the honorable,51
NA,"gentleman hacl made a false assertion,",51
NA,finally evidence was produced which tion.,51
NA,"showed that Dr Atcherley was acting,",51
NA,"under the very nose of the Government,",51
NA,as the secretary of the Canberra branch,51
NA,of the Communist party. I n those cirsocialization ?,51
NA,"cumstances, what confidence can we",51
NA,repose in statements by honorable gentlesocialization.,51
NA,men opposite that the Government is,51
NA,tecting the community against the infiltraprivate,51
NA,tion of Communists into government,51
NA,departments?,51
NA,The eommittee is considering the,51
NA,posed vote for the Department of Transenterprise,51
NA,port. That department is supposed to,51
NA,be engaged upon the standardization of,51
NA,railway gauges in Australia. I think,51
NA,"that a sum of £200,000,000 was appro-",51
NA,priated for that purpose four or five,51
NA,"years ago. Not long ago, I asked the",51
NA,Minister for Transport ( Mr Ward) how,51
NA,many miles of railway line had been uni-,51
NA,for fied since the glorious plan of the Go-,51
NA,"vernment was unfolded to the Parliament,",51
NA,and I was told that not one mile of,51
NA,railway line had then been unified. 1,51
NA,sincerely hope that there is a much better,51
NA,fate in store for the Snowy Mountains,51
NA,"scheme, wbicb, on the eve of a general",51
NA,"election, is being greatly publicized. I t",51
NA,"seems that man proposes, but that God,",51
NA,"in His wisdom, disposes.",51
Mr THOMPSON ,Sometime s it is the,51
NA,High Court.,51
Mr ANTHONY , I thank God that,51
NA,there is a High Court. I hope that,51
NA,the justices of the High Court will live,51
NA,to be very healthy old men. I am sure,51
NA,that the members of the Labour party,51
NA,are wishing them a very short period,51
NA,"of life, so that tbe Government can pack",51
NA,the High Court Bench.,51
NA,The criticisms that have been directed,51
NA,by honorable members on this side of,51
NA,the chamber against the Commonwealth,51
NA,Scientific and Industrial Research Orga-,51
NA,nization have not been concerned with,51
NA,the work of the organization but with,51
NA,infiltration into it. I have,51
NA,never criticized the Commonwealth,51
NA,Scientific and Industrial Research Orga-,51
NA,I nization in respect of the work that it,51
NA,doing or the work that it is not doing.,51
NA,The criticism that I now propose to offer,51
NA,relates to the failure of the Government,51
NA,to provide sufficient money for the ex-,51
NA,but tension and development of the organiza-,51
Mr CALWELL ,I s the honorable gentle-,51
NA,man complaining that there is not enough,51
Mr ANTHONY ,W e do not want,51
NA,We require scientific re-,51
NA,prosearch work to be undertaken so that,51
NA,industry may take advantage of,51
NA,it and use it for the development of,51
NA,Australia in a proper manner. Canada,51
NA,prois one of the strongholds of private,51
NA,in the British Commonwealth,51
NA,According to a document that was pre-,52
NA,sented to the Canadian Parliament with,52
NA,"the Canadian budget papers, i n 1948-49",52
NA,the Canadian Government expended,52
NA,"4S,000,000 dollars upon national scientific",52
NA,research. That sum is probably the equi-,52
NA,"valent of approximately £20,000,000 Aus-",52
NA,tralian. Although the Canadian Govern-,52
NA,"ment has expended £20,000,000 i n a year",52
NA,"upon scientific and industrial research,",52
NA,the Australian Government is prepared,52
NA,"to make only £2,000,000 available this",52
NA,year for that purpose. There are many,52
NA,jobs that the Commonwealth Scientific,52
NA,and Industrial Eesearch Organization,52
NA,could do that i t is not doing.,52
Mr GEORGE LAWSON ,Wha t was done,52
NA,by the Government of which the honor-,52
NA,able member f or Eichmond ( Mr .,52
NA,Anthony) was a supporter?,52
Mr ANTHONY , I t founded the,52
NA,Council for Scientific and Indus-,52
NA,trial Eesearch. The honorable mem-,52
NA,ber for Brisbane ( Mr George Lawson),52
NA,apparently belongs to the,52
NA,of thought that expects to,52
NA,where i t should begin. There would,52
NA,be no development i f theories of that,52
NA,kind were adopted throughout the world.,52
NA,The Governnient of which I. was a mem-,52
NA,bei' established the Council for Scientific,52
NA,and Industrial Eesearch and laid the,52
NA,foundations of most of the work f or which,52
NA,this Government is now claiming the,52
NA,credit. On the north coast of New South,52
NA,Wales there are many noxious weeds that,52
NA,the landholders themselves cannot pos-,52
NA,"sibly control or eradicate, and the Com-",52
NA,monwealth Scientific and Industrial Re-,52
NA,search Organization could do some,52
NA,"experimental work i n that connexion, but,",52
NA,"PO far as I know, i t has not done so.",52
NA,Nothing lias been done in connexion with,52
NA,"hemp, wliich is fast invading some of our",52
NA,best land there. Very little has been,52
NA,done by the Commonwealth Scientific and,52
NA,Industrial Eesearch Organization in re-,52
NA,lation to the deficiencies of the soil along,52
NA,the coastal areas of New South Wales.,52
NA,The organization has pne man at the,52
NA,"experimental f a r m at Wallambah, but he",52
NA,has not yet submitted a report.,52
NA,I believe that in many instances the,52
NA,Government is not paying adequate,52
NA,salaries to its scientific and industrial,52
NA,research workers. The Commonwealth,52
NA,and the States are losing some of their,52
NA,best scientists to other countries because,52
NA,of the low salaries that they offer. The,52
NA,honorable member f o r Brisbane knows,52
NA,"that Dr Young, who is well known to",52
NA,"many members of the committee, is now",52
NA,employed by the Government of Ceylon.,52
Mr BEAZLEY , H e was employed by a,52
NA,State authority.,52
Mr ANTHONY ," T h a t is so, but the",52
NA,salaries that are paid by Commonwealth,52
NA,and State departments have a certain,52
NA,relationship. I f the Commonwealth were,52
NA,to increase the salaries of its scientific,52
NA,"workers, the State governments would be",52
NA,"forced to follow suit. Mr Lewcock, one",52
NA,"of the most noted scientists i n Queensland,",52
NA,is now employed in South Africa to advise,52
NA,upon agricultural problems there. Many,52
NA,of our scientists have been badly treated.,52
NA,"Recently, I spoke to a man who has spent",52
NA,eighteen years of his life i n a Government,52
NA,department. He is a Bachelor of Agricul-,52
NA,tural Science and a Master of Agricul-,52
NA,tural .Science. A f t e r eighteen years of,52
NA,school service his salary is less than £500 a year.,52
NA,finish That man is employed by a State,52
NA,"authority, but the salaries that are paid",52
NA,by the Commonwealth Scientific and I n -,52
NA,dustrial Eesearch Organization are,52
NA,similar to those that are paid by State,52
NA,"authorities, although they may be a little",52
NA,higher. I suggest to the Government and,52
NA,to those who are responsible f or the,52
NA,administration of the Commonwealth,52
NA,Scientific and Industrial Research Organ-,52
NA,ization that the time has come to review,52
NA,"the salaries of our scientists, especially",52
NA,those of the top-grade men who are now,52
NA,being attracted elsewhere. We must ex-,52
NA,pend more money upon research and re-,52
NA,development of scientific techniques. At,52
NA,the present time almost every brancli of,52
NA,trade and industry i n Australia is con-,52
NA,fronted with problems that can only he-,52
NA,solved w i fh the assistance of scientific,52
NA,investigations. What can we hope to,52
NA,"achieve on a budget of £2.000,000 ? The",52
NA,reports that are issued by the Common-,52
NA,wealth Scientific and Industrial Research,52
NA,Organization reveal that the work of the,52
NA,"organization covers many fields, but there",52
NA,is still much to be done.,52
NA,I am a practical farmer. I study,52
NA,the reports that are issued by the Com-,52
NA,monwealth Scientific and Industrial Re-,52
NA,search Organization and other scientific,52
NA,bodies and try to make sense of them. I,53
NA,consider that the Commonwealth Scien-,53
NA,tific and Industrial Research Organiza-,53
NA,tion should publish its findings in such,53
NA,a manner as will enable them to be,53
NA,understood by the ordinary man on,53
NA,"the land, who has to give effect",53
NA,to them. As far as I am able,53
NA,"to judge, the Council for Scientific",53
NA,and Industrial Research adopted the view,53
NA,"that once it completed an investigation,",53
NA,"its responsibility in the matter ended, and",53
NA,that State Departments of Agriculture,53
NA,should distribute the information among,53
NA,interested sections of primary producers.,53
NA,I did not 'agree with that view. I have,53
NA,"always believed that, from beginning to",53
NA,"end, the Council for Scientific and Indus-",53
NA,"trial Research, now the Commonwealth",53
NA,Scientific and Industrial Research,53
NA,"Organization, should conduct investiga-",53
NA,tions and give the widest possible,53
NA,publicity to its findings and recommenda-,53
NA,tions. The problem of hemp which,53
NA,is most serious in the coastal areas,53
NA,"of New South Wales and Queensland,",53
NA,must be solved. This plant pest is rapidly,53
NA,"enveloping thousands of acres, and",53
NA,"farmers, with their present knowledge",53
NA,"and facilities, are unable to control it.",53
NA,Tbey urgently require financial and,53
NA,scientific assistance from the Com-,53
NA,monwealth to enable them to main-,53
NA,tain production in those areas. I f the,53
NA,Government adopts a passive attitude,53
NA,"towards that problem, our production of",53
NA,"food, especially in the dairying districts,",53
NA,will further decline.,53
NA,The Minister for Post-war Reconstruc-,53
NA,tion has defended the screening methods,53
NA,that are employed to exclude Communists,53
NA,from the staff' of the Commonwealth,53
NA,Scientific and Industrial Research,53
NA,Organization. I wonder whether the,53
NA,honorable gentleman's attention has been,53
NA,drawn to the report of a meeting of tbe,53
NA,Sydney University Labour Club some,53
NA,"time ago, at which some 200 students pro-",53
NA,tested against the dismissal from the Com-,53
NA,monwealth Scientific and Industrial,53
NA,"Research Organization of Mr Kaiser, who",53
NA,had participated in a Communist demon-,53
NA,stration in London. The report states,53
NA,"that a Dr Makinson, lecturer in physics,",53
NA,said-,53
NA,America is endeavouring to dictate,53
NA,internal policy.,53
NA,Mr Anthony.,53
NA,I. do not assume that Dr Makinson is a,53
NA,member of the staff of the Commonwealth.,53
NA,"Scientific and Industrial Research,",53
NA,"Organization, but I point out that the-",53
NA,statement which he made is very much on.,53
NA,the Communist line. Some 200 students-,53
NA,"of the university supported the motion of.""",53
NA,protest.,53
Mr DEDMAN ,Wha t has that to db>,53
NA,vvith the Commonwealth ?,53
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN , ',53
NA,( Mr Lazzarini) -I t certainly is not,53
NA,related to the Estimates of the depart-,53
NA,ments under consideration.,53
Mr HARRISON ,I s the Minister for,53
NA,Post-war Reconstruction defending the,53
NA,Communists?,53
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN , -,53
NA,The honorable member for Richmond had,53
NA,"better leave the matter there, and deal",53
NA,with a subject that is relevant to these,53
NA,Estimates.,53
Mr ANTHONY , I shall not pursue,53
NA,the matter further than to say that an,53
NA,"amount of £115,000 has been voted this",53
NA,year for security measures.,53
NA,Tbe TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN -,53
NA,Order ! That is too thin.,53
Mr ANTHONY ,I f we have to rely,53
NA,upon the assurances of the Minister for,53
NA,Post-war Reconstruction that the Com-,53
NA,monwealth Scientific and Industrial,53
NA,Research Organization is completely,53
NA,screened against infiltration by Com-,53
NA,"munists, the vote should be considerably",53
NA,increased.,53
Mr BEAZLEY , I desire to make a per-,53
NA,sonal explanation. I n the early part of,53
NA,"his speech, the honorable member for",53
NA,Richmond ( Mr Anthony) referred to,53
NA,some remarks that I had made and endea-,53
NA,voured to refute my suggestion that the,53
NA,booklet on social services was not partisan.,53
NA,He said that I knew that that booklet,53
NA,"contained the words, "" Vote for Labour,",53
NA,"Webb for Swan"". I bave examined",53
NA,"the 32 pages of the booklet, and I find",53
NA,that that statement does not occur on any,53
NA,of the pages. The bonorable member held,53
NA,"up a copy of the booklet, and it was",53
NA,obvious that those words had been inserted,53
NA,with a rubber stamp. Having made that,53
NA,"statement, the honorable member pro-",53
NA,"our ceeded to wave the booklet about his head,",53
NA,and claim that it contained statements,53
NA,tbat were Labour propaganda. I t was,54
NA,obvious that tliose words had not been,54
NA,"printed by the Commonwealth, or the",54
NA,"Governinent Printer, and that it would",54
NA,"be competent for any person, using a",54
NA,"rubber stamp, to imprint any statement",54
NA,"in the booklet. The honorable gentleman,",54
NA,in suggesting that I had misled the com-,54
NA,"mittee, was himself misleading it.",54
Mr CALWELL ,Melbourne-Ministe r all,54
NA,for Information ancl Minister for,54
NA,gration) [4.10] - I shall endeavour to and objectively written.,54
NA,"be brief, because I realize that",54
NA,honorable members desire to speak on I,54
NA,the Estimates for the five departments,54
NA,which are now under discussion. I,54
NA,obliged to make an observation on,54
NA,remarks of the honorable member for,54
NA,"Balaclava ( Mr White), who waved the",54
NA,various publications in the air and made,54
NA,disparaging comments upon them. He ments.,54
NA,claimed that all of them were sheer,54
NA,"Labour party propaganda, ancl that",54
NA,Government wa9 misusing public funds,54
NA,in publishing them. The honorable,54
NA,niember said that the paper could,54
NA,have been used to better purpose ments to publicize.,54
NA,in publishing tlic novels or poems of,54
NA,deserving Australian writers. I inform,54
NA,the honorable gentleman that the quantity,54
NA,"of newsprint, and even the superfine",54
NA,and calendar paper used in all,54
NA,Commonwealth and State government,54
NA,"departments in one year, would not",54
NA,equal the quantity of paper that,54
NA,is used in a newspaper office in,54
NA,one day. The honorable member was,54
NA,very wide of the mark i f he thought that fashion.,54
NA,savings of newsprint by governments,54
NA,would provide a great reservoir of,54
NA,material for the publication of the,54
NA,of deserving novelists ancl poets.,54
NA,honorable member for Balaclava also,54
NA,referred to an excellent publication,54
NA,the Minister for Works and Housing,54
NA,"( Mr Lemmon), in which the operation",54
NA,of tbe Commonwealth and State Housing,54
NA,.Agreemeni; is described. As the honorable,54
NA,member for Eremantle ( Mr Beazley),54
NA,"has pointed out, that scheme is functiontific",54
NA,"ing under an agreement, between the",54
NA,Commonwealth and every State governof,54
NA,"ment, irrespective of the political views",54
NA,of the several parties to it.,54
Mr THOMPSON ,Sout h Australia is,54
NA,not a party to that agreement.,54
Mr CALWELL ,Tha t is so. South,54
NA,Australia is the only exception. I regard,54
NA,all those publications as conveying excel-,54
NA,"lent lessons in civics, and I think that they",54
NA,deal with matters of great public interest.,54
NA,The Labour Government has always ex-,54
NA,perienced great difficulty in securing the,54
NA,publication of facts about our community-,54
NA,"life ancl economy, and in order to ensure",54
NA,that that story shall reach people of,54
NA,"political views, it lias to secure pub-",54
NA,Immilication of documents that are well,54
NA,For such,54
NA,other there is a great public demand.,54
NA,tbink that the honorable mem-,54
NA,ber for Balaclava indulged in rather,54
NA,am small-minded criticism of the Go-,54
NA,the vernment when he said that those,54
NA,publications were not good. He adopted,54
NA,wrong attitude in saying that govern-,54
NA,ments should not publicize their achieve-,54
NA,All previous Commonwealtli,54
NA,"governments have publicized their actions,",54
NA,the and all State governments do so.,54
Mr MCLEOD ,Som e Commonwealth,54
NA,governments in the past had no achieve-,54
Mr CALWELL ,I f some govern-,54
NA,"ments did not publicize what they did, the",54
NA,reason might well have been that they had,54
NA,no achievements to publiciae. .,54
NA,The lionorable member for Richmond,54
NA,( Mr Anthony) has made a series of,54
NA,bitter attacks upon the Minister for,54
NA,"Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman),",54
NA,who is a very honest man who tells his,54
NA,story to the chamber in a forthright,54
NA,For a honorable member,54
NA,to say that the Opposition does not,54
NA,accept any assurance that he gives is,54
NA,works contemptible. I have never known any,54
NA,The Minister of any government at any,54
NA,time who has deliberately attempted to,54
NA,"by mislead the Parliament, and certainly",54
NA,the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction,54
NA,"has never"" attempted to do so. The",54
NA,criticism that the Minister is not ful-,54
NA,filling his responsibilities as the Minister,54
NA,in charge of the Commonwealth Scien-,54
NA,and Industrial Research Organiza-,54
NA,tion is just too laughable. As a matter,54
NA,"fact, the honorable gentleman is ex-",54
NA,pending six times as much money as was,54
NA,expended when the honorable member for,54
NA,"Richmond ceased to be a Minister, and",54
NA,he would expend more i f he could see a,54
NA,"profitable way of doing so, such as",54
NA,"obtaining the services of more scientists,",55
NA,securing more equipment and generally,55
NA,doing the things which he believes are i n Bay.,55
NA,the interests of the Australian people and,55
NA,particularly the primary producers. I,55
NA,"that respect, as i n all other respects,",55
NA,Minister has done his work very well,55
NA,"painstakingly, and at great sacrifice of",55
NA,time and energy.,55
NA,The honorable member f o r Balaclava,55
NA,referred to certain provisions of the Com-,55
NA,monwealth Electoral Act. I f he desires,55
NA,"to raise that point, I inform",55
NA,"passing, that the provisions of the act",55
NA,have been violated f o r many years i n,55
NA,respect of the amount of money that has,55
NA,"been expended, not by candidates, but by",55
NA,big organizations such as the Australian,55
NA,"Constitutional League, which have tried",55
NA,to influence public opinion.,55
Mr WHITE ,Di d the Minister,55
NA,approve of that expenditure?,55
Mr CALWELL ," N o , and I should be",55
NA,"glad to have the support of the honorable Barnard, H. C.",55
NA,"member i n the matter. I do not think Beazley, K. E.",55
NA,"that the provisions of the Commonwealth Calwell, A. A.",55

NA,honorable member is not entitled to make,61

NA,PRIVILEGE.,61
Mr MCEWEN ,Indi) -Th e matter of,61
NA,privilege that I have already indicated,61
NA,I desire to raise relates to discrimination,61
NA,in respect of the permitted use of,61
NA,"language, according to whether an honor-",61
NA,able member sits on the rigbt or the left,61
NA,side of the Chair.,61
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Order !,61
NA,The honorable member must confine him-,61
NA,self to the matter of privilege that he,61
NA,desires to raise. He must not reflect on,61
NA,the conduct of the House by the Chairman,61
NA,of Committees.,61
Mr MCEWEN ,Th e point I am,61
NA,raising refers to the conduct of this,61
NA,House and the discrimination against,61
NA,lionorable memlbers,61
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order !,61
NA,The honorable member is referring to a,61
NA,matter that took place in committee. He,61
NA,is aware that the Chair has no knowledge,61
NA,of what takes place in committee and he,61
NA,is not entitled to deal in the House with,61
NA,ruling that was given in committee. He,61
NA,may not raise in the House a question,61
NA,relating to a ruling given in committee.,61
Mr MCEWEN , I do not wish to enter,61
NA,into any controversy. That is the last,61
NA,thing I desire to do. But I wish to raise,61
NA,a matter of privilege which affects honor-,61
NA,able members of the House. I f your,61
NA,"ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that I",61
NA,ain not permitted to raise the matter of,61
NA,"permissible language at this stage, I must",61
NA,point out that the Temporary Chairman,61
NA,of Committees did not permit me to,61
NA,"raise it while we were in committee, and",61
NA,therefore I am debarred both in the,61
NA,House and in committee from referring,61
NA,to an urgent matter which concerns the,61
NA,privilege of honorable members.,61
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Order !,61
NA,The honorable member is getting several,61
NA,"matters mixed. His point, as I under-",61
NA,"stand it, relates to a ruling given in com-",61
NA,inittee. I f he had any view to express on,61
NA,that matter he should have raised it at,61
NA,the time that it occurred. He was,61
NA,entitled to go even further for he could,61
NA,have taken steps to disagree with the,61
NA,ruling of the Temporary Chairman.,61
NA,But he is not entitled to canvass in the,61
NA,"House a ruling given in committee,",61
NA,because the Chair has no knowledge of,61
NA,what takes place in committee.,61
Mr MENZIES , I rise to order. This,61
NA,"matter is really very disturbing, because,,",61
NA,although Mr Deputy Speaker may not,61
NA,pay any attention officially to happenings,61
NA,"in committee, the fact is that i t has heen",61
NA,ruled that no question of privilege may,61
NA,be raised in committee. I f no question of,61
NA,"privilege may be raised in committee,,",61
NA,"although Standing Order 280 expressly,",61
NA,provides that no member shall interrupt,61
NA,"another member whilst speaking, unless",61
NA,to call attention to a point of order or,61
NA,"privilege suddenly arising, then it mu9t",61
NA,be that a point of order or privilege-,61
NA,"cannot be raised at all, or it can be raised",61
NA,"in the House. You, Mr Deputy Speaker,",61
NA,have just ruled,61
NA,"Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,- I have",61
NA,not ruled on a point of privilege.,61
Mr MENZIES ,Th e honorable member,61
NA,for Indi is raising a point of privilege.,61
NA,What I have in mind is that such,61
NA,a point must be capable of being raised,61
NA,a either in the House or in the committee.,61
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order !,61
NA,A matter of privilege may be raised by,61
NA,an honorable member in the House. The,61
NA,"point, as I see it, is that the honorable",61
NA,member for Indi is attempting to canvass,61
NA,a ruling given in committee. Such a,61
NA,matter should have been raised at the,61
NA,time in committee and the decision of the,61
NA,Temporary Chairman given thereon. I t,61
NA,is not for the Chair now to accept any,61
NA,canvassing of a ruling of the Temporary,61
NA,Chairman of Committees.,61
Mr MCEWEN ,"The n I desire, Mr.",61
NA,"Deputy Speaker, to give notice of a sub-",61
NA,stantive motion of dissent from the,61
NA,Temporary Chairman's ruling on the,61
NA,"ground that it exercises bias, and dis-",61
NA,criminates against members of the Oppo-,61
NA,sition in the discharge of their public,61
NA,duties.,61
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Order !,61
NA,The honorable member is not entitled to,61
NA,address himself to such a motion at this,61
NA,stage. He may give notice of such a,62
NA,"motion in ""writing in the normal way.",62
NA,"Mr MCEWEN"" -The n I shall give",62
NA,.such notice and will hand it in in writing.,62
NA,Does such a motion require a seconder?,62
Mr ANTHONY , I would second the,62
NA,motion.,62
Mr MENZIES , I understand that Mr.,62
NA,Deputy Speaker has ruled that the honor-,62
NA,able member for Indi may continue with,62
NA,his point of privilege at this stage on a,62
NA,matter that occurred in committee.,62
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , I have,62
NA,not prevented the honorable member from,62
NA,raising a point of privilege. He is,62
NA,-entitled to raise a point of privilege; but,62
NA,the interpretation that I have put upon,62
NA,his remarks is that the matter that he is,62
NA,endeavouring to discuss amounts to the,62
NA,-canvassing of a ruling of the Temporary,62
NA,-Chairman. Therefore he is not raising a,62
NA,legitimate matter of privilege. As I have,62
NA,"said, the matter of the actual ruling of the",62
NA,Temporary Chairman should have been,62
NA,-dealt with in the committee. I t is not one,62
NA,for the House.,62
Mr MCEWEN , I was addressing,62
NA,myself to a question of privilege.,62
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Order !,62
NA,I f the honorable member proposes to con-,62
NA,tinue to address himself to the ruling that,62
NA,was given by the Temporary Chairman in,62
NA,"-committee, he is not entitled to do so. I f",62
NA,".he desires to raise a matter of privilege,",62
NA,he is entitled to do so.,62
Mr ANTHONY , I rise to order.,62
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Ther e is,62
NA,no point of order.,62
Mr MCEWEN ,Sinc e I com-,62
NA,menced to speak of this matter a few,62
NA,"minutes ago, I have not, as reference to",62
NA,"the Hansard report will verify, referred",62
NA,to the ruling of the Temporary Chairman.,62
NA,"You, yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker, have",62
NA,presumed that I was referring to the,62
NA,Tilling of the Temporary Chairman. My,62
NA,remarks have been directed to the subject,62
NA,of discrimination in the permissible em-,62
NA,"ployment of language, according to",62
NA,-whether it is used by members on the right,62
NA,or on the left of the Chair. As I have,62
NA,"said, I desire",62
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Order !,62
NA,The Chair is required to determine,62
NA,whether a matter of privilege suddenly,62
NA,"arising is a ma tter of urgency, and I know",62
NA,of no urgency in the present instance that,62
NA,would warrant the honorable member,62
NA,pursuing the matter at this stage.,62
Mr MCEWEN ,I f that is your rul-,62
NA,"ing, Mr Deputy Speaker, you compel me",62
NA,to take the course provided by the Stand-,62
NA,ing Orders of giving notice of dissent in,62
NA,the terms that I have indicated. I,62
NA,understand that the honorable mem-,62
NA,ber for Richmond will second tbe,62
NA,motion. I give notice of motion,62
NA,"and hand it in in writing, in",62
NA,accordance with Standing Order 407. I,62
NA,now desire to move that the Standing,62
NA,Orders be suspended for the purpose of,62
NA,enabling me to discuss immediately the,62
NA,motion of which I have given notice. I,62
NA,invoke the support of Standing Order,62
NA,"407, which states that in cases of",62
NA,urgency,62
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Order !,62
NA,The honorable meniber is not entitled to,62
NA,"get away with that, either. The Chair",62
NA,has ruled on the question whether there,62
NA,is urgent necessity in this case. The,62
NA,Standing Order provides that-,62
NA,"I n case of urgent necessity, any Standing or",62
NA,Sessional Order or Orders of the House may be,62
NA,"suspended for the day's sitting, on Motion,",62
NA,"duly made and seconded, without notice: Pro-",62
NA,vided that such motion is carried by an abso-,62
NA,lute majority of the whole number of Mem-,62
NA,bers of the House.,62
NA,I rule that such urgent necessity does not,62
NA,arise in this case and that the motion of,62

Mr GULLETT ,Henty) [4.59] - I,63
NA,desire to make several observations on,63
NA,the Estimates as they affect the Depart-,63
NA,ment of the Army. I do not propose to,63
NA,offer any general criticism of the Go-,63
NA,"vernment's defence policy, particularly",63
NA,"as it affects the Army, because, on a",63
NA,number of previous occasions I have,63
NA,said exactly what I think of the whole,63
NA,basis of defence as it is advanced by this,63
NA,"Govemment. Briefly, I have always con-",63
NA,sidered the Government's defence policy,63
NA,inadequate and an evasion of its re-,63
NA,sponsibility to defend the country,63
NA,adequately. Its policy is lacking in,63
NA,"courage, and is indeed a coAvardly policy.",63
NA,That has been said time and time again,63
NA,and on this occasion I do not intend to,63
NA,attack the basis of this country's military,63
NA,defence which relies on a minute and,63
NA,"understaffed permanent army. ""We have",63
NA,a very much smaller volunteer army than,63
NA,we had before the last war. I wish to,63
NA,"comment, however, on several aspects of",63
NA,the militia scheme in which the Govern-,63
NA,ment has put its faith. The great body,63
NA,of the troops who are supposed to defend,63
NA,this country in time of emergency is,63
NA,what we loosely call the militia. We were,63
NA,bold that we were to Have a part-time,63
NA,"army of 50,000 men, but at the end of",63
NA,nearly two years after the scheme was,63
NA,"first introduced, only 13,000 men have",63
NA,been enlisted. I n effect we have to-day,63
NA,an army that is somewhat smaller than,63
NA,"the country's police forces, and is of a",63
NA,contemptible strength.,63
NA,The honorable member for Darwin,63
NA,(Dame Enid Lyons) earlier to-day raised,63
NA,the question of how even that very small,63
NA,"force is being managed, and she ex-",63
NA,pressed the opinion that even although its,63
NA,"strength is so small, numbers of men bave",63
NA,recently resigned. I think that she cited,63
NA,"the figure of 4,000 men who have ceased",63
NA,to engage in part-time training. But the,63
NA,"Minister for the Army ( Mr Chambers),",63
NA,as he always does when such criticisms,63
NA,"are levelled, said that there was no truth",63
NA,in her statement and that it was no doubt,63
NA,some sort of newspaper gossip. He dis-,63
NA,missed it as nonsense. As a matter of,63
NA,"fact, there is a great deal of truth in",63
NA,statements that the honorable member for,63
NA,Darwin advanced. The Minister knows,63
NA,very well that recruiting for the militia,63
NA,forces came to a standstill some months,63
NA,"ago, and that a large number of men have",63
NA,resigned or have simply ceased to attend,63
NA,parades; and thus have ceased to be effec-,63
NA,tive. I n some cases their commanding,63
NA,officers have had to ask such men to,63
NA,resign because it is of no benefit to the,63
NA,country to have men on the books when,63
NA,they are performing absolutely no service.,63
NA,"I n order, to discover how poor recruit-",63
NA,ing now is we do not require to look any,63
NA,further than the battalion raised in the,63
NA,"Australian Capital Territory, which has",63
NA,"an establishment of about 800 men,",63
NA,"but the strength of which is actually, I",63
NA,"suggest, below 200 men. That is a posi-",63
NA,tion which existsright throughout the,63
NA,Commonwealth. Unit after unit goes into,63
NA,camp with only a handful of men,63
NA,to be trained. Yet the Minister expresses,63
NA,great satisfaction over that state of,63
NA,"affairs. He says, in effect, that it is",63
NA,wonderful that after two years we have,63
NA,"13,000 men ready to do part-time train-",63
NA,ing. The militia scheme is so badly,63
NA,administered at the present time that the,63
NA,military authorities are unable to em-,63
NA,ploy properly the men they have. They,63
NA,cannot attract more men and tbey cannot,63
NA,even hold those that they already have.,63
NA,One of the reasons for that is that the,63
NA,small amount that those soldiers receive,63
NA,in payment as a result of their willingness,63
NA,"to undertake voluntary military training,",63
NA,is subject to taxation. A man who volun-,63
NA,teers for service in the militia finds at,63
NA,the end of the financial year that he has,63
NA,earned perhaps £50 for his military,63
NA,service. That amount must be shown,63
NA,with his other income for the purposes,63
NA,"of tax assessment, which frequently means",63
NA,that his voluntary service in the militia,63
NA,"actually costs him money, because the",63
NA,amount that he earns thereby brings him,63
NA,into a higher taxation field. I raised,63
NA,this matter about two years ago when,63
NA,the scheme was first introduced and the,63
NA,Minister said that he would give some,63
NA,consideration to an adjustment of it.,63
NA,"I daresay that he did so, but the decision",63
NA,was unfavorable. I cannot see the least,63
NA,reason for taxing the amounts paid to,63
NA,the soldiers who have undertaken part-time,63
NA,"training, and I ask tbe Minister once",63
NA,"more i f he will reconsider this matter,",63
NA,which constitutes a gross injustice. A,63
NA,great many men who undertake part-time,64
NA,military duties find themselves out of,64
NA,pocket as a result of so doing. Many of,64
NA,them have to travel great distances by car,64
NA,"to engage in training and, as tbe Minister",64
NA,"knows, the travelling expenses allowed",64
NA,to them are quite inadequate. I n addi-,64
NA,"tion, as the Minister knows, or ought to",64
NA,"know, any officer or non-commissioned",64
NA,officer who takes his duty seriously has,64
NA,to spend far more time on the training,64
NA,of men than he is actually credited with.,64
NA,I again ask the Government to give,64
NA,favorable consideration to the exemption,64
NA,of military pay from income tax. The,64
NA,need for inducing more young men to,64
NA,join our armed forces is great enough,64
NA,to justify sucb a course. Let the Minister,64
NA,take this step to show that the Govern-,64
NA,ment has some appreciation of what,64
NA,it is asking these men to do.,64
NA,I wish to refer now to the manner,64
NA,in which the figures relating to the,64
NA,strength of the armed forces have been,64
NA,presented in this chamber. The Minister,64
NA,has said that we have a permanent army,64
NA,"of 19,000 men. I point out that at least",64
NA,"5,000 members of the so-called permanent",64
NA,army are really members of the interim,64
NA,army. I t is most misleading for the,64
NA,Minister to say that we have a per-,64
NA,"manent army of record numbers when,",64
NA,"in fact, a great number of the men could",64
NA,resign at any moment they desired to,64
NA,"do so, and another very large number",64
NA,of them perform duties of a purely,64
NA,administrative character. I n order to,64
NA,ascertain the strength of the regular,64
NA,army we have only to consider the,64
NA,strength of the permanent brigade. This,64
NA,much vaunted permanent brigade has,64
NA,not even the strength of a battalion.,64
NA,Under present conditions it is very un-,64
NA,likely that it will attain the strength,64
NA,of a battalion for a considerable time.,64
NA,"I f that statement is not correct, let",64
NA,the Minister state specifically how far,64
NA,below strength our permanent army units,64
NA,really are. At about this time last year,64
NA,I had occasion to cite the figures relating,64
NA,to one of the battalions of our permanent,64
NA,"army. At that time, it was less than one-",64
NA,quarter of the target strength. My state-,64
NA,"ment was not then contradicted, and no",64
NA,facts or figures have since been forth-,64
NA,coming from the Minister to prove that,64
NA,it was inaccurate. I know that the figures,64
NA,which I have cited are correct. This,64
NA,Government is indulging in great de-,64
NA,ception in painting such a false picture,64
NA,of tbe defence forces of this country.,64
NA,As the honorable member for Bendigo,64
NA,( Mr Rankin) said in his speech during,64
NA,"the general debate on the budget, never",64
NA,before in such troublous times have we,64
NA,had less with whieh to defend ourselves.,64
NA,I do not intend to deal at length with,64
NA,the subject of compulsory military train-,64
NA,ing. I merely point out that even New,64
NA,"Zealand, which has a socialist Govern-",64
NA,"ment, has determined that all the citizens",64
NA,of that dominion shallbe in a posi-,64
NA,tion to defend their country.,64
NA,I propose now to say a few words,64
NA,about the decision of the Government,64
NA,to use army personnel on the northern,64
NA,coal-fields during the recent coal strike.,64
NA,That was the most cowardly action which,64
NA,this Government has taken. I t des-,64
NA,troyed whatever confidence in the Army,64
NA,the great Labour movement may have,64
NA,"held, and gave rise to a great deal of",64
NA,resentment. I t was well known that,64
NA,the requisite labour could bave been,64
NA,obtained from among the members of tbe,64
NA,"Australian Workers Union. Indeed, the",64
NA,members of that union volunteered to,64
NA,work the mines. The Government did not,64
NA,use their services because i t feared to,64
NA,split its party political affiliations. Its,64
NA,decision to use members of the armed,64
NA,forces on this work destroyed the con-,64
NA,fidence of the unions in the armed forces,64
NA,of this country. That was one of the,64
NA,worst actions that has ever been taken,64
NA,"by any government in this country, and",64
NA,the honorable gentleman who calls himself,64
NA,"the Minister for the Army, having per-",64
NA,"mitted that to be done, is unworthy to",64
NA,occupy his present position.,64
Mr CHAMBERS ,Adelaide-Ministe r,64
NA,for the Army) [5.10] - I usually have a,64
NA,great deal of respect for the contributions,64
NA,to our debates by the honorable member,64
NA,for Henty ( Mr Gullett); but to-day,64
NA,it was obvious that he was determined to,64
NA,indulge in party political propaganda on,64
NA,the eve of the general election. He made a,64
NA,personal attack on me and said that the,64
NA,Government had committed an act of,64
NA,deception in misrepresenting the strength,64
NA,"of the Permanent Military Forces, and the",64
NA,position in relation to warlike equipment.,64
NA,I emphatically deny the charge that the,65
NA,Government has been guilty of deception,65
NA,in this matter. I have never said that,65
NA,"there are 19,000 members of the Perman-",65
NA,ent Military Forces. What I have said,65
NA,is that the strength of the Permanent,65
NA,"Military Forces is now 15,500. That",65
NA,figure is authentic. I am able to give,65
NA,details relating to the placement of those,65
NA,forces.,65
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON , I placed,65
NA,question on the notice-paper relating to,65
NA,"that very matter more than a month ago,",65
NA,but I have not yet received a reply.,65
Mr CHAMBERS , I informed the,65
NA,honorable member yesterday that I had,65
NA,received a reply which bad been prepared,65
NA,"by the department, but that, as i t con-",65
NA,"tained some inaccuracies, I had sent it",65
NA,back for further examination. The reply,65
NA,which was furnished by the department,65
NA,did not contain all the figures for which,65
NA,the honorable member had asked. I did,65
NA,not want to answer his question only in,65
NA,"part, and for that reason there has been",65
NA,a further delay. The members of the,65
NA,Permanent Military Forces have been,65
NA,distributed over the following arms of the,65
NA,services:-,65
NA,Army and Command Head-quarters,65
NA,"and Administrative Staffs . . 2,000",65
NA,"Schools, Courses and Training, includ-",65
NA,"ing training overseas . . 2,000",65
NA,"Artillery, Armoured Units and Aus-",65
NA,"tralian Eoyal Artiller y cadres . . 2,500",65
NA,"Engineers .. . . 1,000",65
NA,Survey and Signals,65
NA,Infantry .. .. ..,65
NA,"Army Service Medical and Dental . . 1,000",65
NA,Army Ordnance and Mechanical,65
NA,Engineers,65
NA,"Becruits undergoing training . . 1,000",65
NA,Other Miscellaneous Units ..,65
NA,"Since those figures were prepared, the",65
NA,numbers have been slightly increased. I t,65
NA,is rather amazing that honorable members,65
NA,opposite should condemn the defence,65
NA,policy of tbis Government when the record,65
NA,of the governments which they formed,65
NA,in past years is such a sorry one. I n 1938,65
NA,when everybody in Australia except the,65
NA,Government then in power knew that this,65
NA,country would soon be at war,65
Mr MENZIES ,The Minister should,65
NA,read Hansard.,65
Mr CHAMBERS ,These are the,65
NA,facts.,65
Mr MENZIES ,Th e Minister's own,65
NA,Leader said that there was no need for a,65
NA,defence vote.,65
Mr CHAMBERS ,W e were then in,65
NA,Opposition. I t is of no use for the right,65
NA,lionorable gentleman to quote what,65
NA,the then Leader of the Opposition may,65
NA,have said on the matter. The right,65
NA,a honorable gentleman was then himself,65
NA,responsible for the defence of this country,65
NA,as we are responsible for it now. We,65
NA,have accepted our responsibility in the,65
NA,fullest sense.,65
Mr MENZIES ,Th e Minister then,65
NA,opposed the defence vote.,65
Mr CHAMBERS , I was not a mem-,65
NA,ber of the Parliament at that time.,65
Mr MENZIES ,I t is true that we did,65
NA,not have the pleasure of the honorable,65
NA,gentleman's acquaintance then. His,65
NA,colleagues in the Australian Labour party,65
NA,opposed the defence vote.,65
Mr CHAMBERS ,I n 1938-39 Ger-,65
NA,many had developed a great war potential.,65
NA,The 1914-18 war left Germany's war,65
NA,potential practically -untouched. Within,65
NA,"a short, space of time after the conclusion",65
NA,of World War I . Germany was able to,65
NA,"train another huge fighting force, and",65
NA,to equip it with all the implements of,65
NA,war. The world knew that Germany was,65
NA,preparing for another war. Italy still,65
NA,had the capacity to place a large fighting,65
NA,"1,000. force in the field, and Japan had",65
NA,"1,000 emerged from World War I . virtually",65
NA,untouched. Although it was common,65
NA,"2,500 knowledge throughout the world that",65
NA,"Germany, Italy and Japan were pre-",65
NA,"1,000 paring for war, the strength of the",65
NA,permanent military forces of Australia,65
NA,"15,000 in 1938-39 was less than 5,000 men.",65
Mr WHITE ,W e then had five divi-,65
NA,sions of citizen forces.,65
Mr CHAMBERS ,Tha t is not so.,65
NA,At that time General Squires protested,65
NA,against the inflated figures that had been,65
NA,given to him relating to our defence,65
NA,forces. He complained that the personnel,65
NA,available to him were not in accordance,65
NA,with the stated figures.,65
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,I s the Minis-,65
NA,ter able to table a report containing such,65
NA,a statement?,65
Mr MENZIES ,H e cannot do so. Such,66
NA,a report would of course be characterized,66
NA,as confidential.,66
Mr CHAMBERS , I can authenti-,66
NA,cate every statement that I have made.,66
NA,When the strength of the Commonwealth,66
NA,military forces was supposed to he,66
NA,"50,000, it was actually only about 25,000.",66
NA,The present strength of the Citizen,66
NA,"M i l i t a r y Eorces, which were established",66
NA,only a little more than twelve months,66
NA,"ago, is 15,000. Thus the total strength",66
NA,of the Citizen M i l i t a r y Forces and the,66
NA,Permanent M i l i t a r y Forces is approxi-,66
NA,"mately 30,500. The 1914-18 war l e f t",66
NA,virtually untouched the countries which,66
NA,subsequently attacked the British Empire,66
NA,and its Allies in 1939. Their capacity to,66
NA,engage i n another great war was unim-,66
NA,paired.,66
Mr MCBRIDE ,Wlia t about Russia?,66
Mr CHAMBERS ,Whe n tlie Chief,66
NA,of the General Staff recently returned,66
NA,from Japan he said that to a very great,66
NA,extent Russia's industrial capacity had,66
NA,been destroyed during World War II .,66
NA,"ancl that Russia had lost 7,000,000 of its",66
NA,most virile population. We cannot over-,66
NA,look the fact that when honorable mem-,66
NA,bers opposite formed the Government of,66
NA,"this country, and the world was on the",66
NA,"verge of another great conflict, tlieir plane",66
NA,for the defence of this country were i n,66
NA,no way comparable with the defence plans,66
NA,to which this Government has given effect,66
NA,at a time when the prospects of war are,66
NA,somewhat remote.,66
Mr MENZIES ,Th e Lyons Government,66
NA,was described by the Labour Opposition,66
NA,of the day a.s a government of war-,66
NA,mongers.,66
Mr CHAMBERS , This Govern-,66
NA,ment's defence plans are far more com-,66
NA,prehensive than were those of the anti-,66
NA,Labour Government which was i n office,66
NA,at the outbreak of World War II . These,66
NA,facts cannot he denied.,66
Mr MENZIES ,Bu t they are denied.,66
NA,"This, from a Labour man, sounds like",66
NA,nothing on earth to me.,66
Mr CHAMBERS ,Le t us compare,66
NA,"the position that, existed then with the",66
NA,present position i n relation to the supply,66
NA,of equipment. Adequate stocks of war-like,66
NA,"stores, including guns and ammunition,",66
NA,are now held both f o r the protection of,66
NA,the troops and to enable our troops to,66
NA,engage an enemy until such time as Aus-,66
NA,tralia's manufacturing capacity can be,66
NA,brought into f u l l operation. A t the out-,66
NA,break of the war i n 1939 the equipment,66
NA,position was scandalous. A l l that was,66
NA,available was the residue of the 1914-1S,66
NA,war. Equipment not only was inadequate,66
NA,but also had been out-moded .by more,66
NA,modern equipment i n the hands of our,66
NA,"potential enemies, who, unlike ourselves,",66
NA,had long before commenced to re-arm,66
NA,aud had concentrated the national effort,66
NA,on extensive war preparations.,66
Mr WHITE ,Whos e report is this?,66
Mr CHAMBERS , I have been com-,66
NA,paring our capacity to-day w i th that i n,66
NA,1939. I f one travels round Australia,66
NA,to-day one w i l l see our tremendous-,66
NA,ordnance stores. They are stocked with,66
NA,"guns, signal equipment, radar and other",66
NA,devices that we did not possess i n 1939.,66
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,Som e of them,66
NA,had not then been invented.,66
Mr CHAMBERS , I realize that the,66
NA,attitude that is being adopted by the,66
NA,Opposition at the present time is dictated,66
NA,by party political propaganda purposes.,66
NA,The honorable member f o r Henty con-,66
NA,demned the Government because i t made,66
NA,use of tbe armed forces during the recent,66
NA,coal' strike. The honorable gentleman,66
NA,"said, i n his knowing way, that the Aus-",66
NA,tralian Workers Union volunteered to do-,66
NA,the work that was done by the A r m y and,66
NA,that i t would have done i t had i t been,66
NA,asked to do so. The Australian Workers,66
NA,"Union could not do that work, because",66
NA,its constitution does not make the,66
NA,necessary provision. I t is wrong,66
NA,to say that the people of Aus-,66
NA,"tralia, have condemned the Govern-",66
NA,ment and the Australian fighting forces,66
NA,for tiieir actions during the strike. No-,66
NA,one is i n a better position than I ami,66
NA,"to know that the action that was taken,",66
NA,by the Government then was highly com-,66
NA,mended by the people. I remind honor-,66
NA,able gentlemen opposite that never before-,66
NA,i n the history of Australia bas an Aus-,66
NA,tralian army been able to undertake i n,66
NA,peace-time an operation such as that,66
NA,which i t undertook during the coal strike.,66
Mr LANG, -I s that what the A r m y is,66
NA,for?,66
Mr CHAMBERS ,Tha t is not what although,67
NA,the Army is for. No one regretted more,67
NA,than I did that it was necessary to use,67
NA,the Army for that purpose on that occaMilitary,67
NA,sion ; but the events of the coal strike,67
NA,have proved at least that we now have,67
NA,Army thai is capable of meeting a six months.,67
NA,national emergency. The Australian,67
NA,people do not despise the Government or,67
NA,the fighting forces for their actions,67
NA,during that emergency. No members of week.,67
NA,the forces objected to doing the work,67
NA,that was done.,67
NA,The Government has every reason to,67
NA,be proud of its defence programme.,67
NA,1-939 our potential enemies were powerful,67
NA,nations. They had a tremendous indusMilitary,67
NA,trial capacity and could produce the,67
NA,armaments and equipment that are necespresent,67
NA,sary to fight a war. To-day they are no those two forces.,67
NA,longer in that position.,67
Mr TURNBULL ,"""Wha t about Russia?",67
Mr CHAMBERS , I do not believe,67
NA,that Russia is so powerful that it could,67
NA,destroy all the democratic nations.,67
Mr TURNBULL ,Fact s and figures do,67
NA,not support that belief.,67
Mr CHAMBERS ,Honorabl e gentle matters,67
NA,men opposite were paying great tributes,67
NA,to the Russians not very long ago.,67
NA,position bas changed.,67
Mr MENZIES ,Ha s not the position,67
NA,changed ?,67
Mr CHAMBERS ,I t has. High,67
NA,military authorities have said that,67
NA,Russia is not the powerful military nation,67
NA,that members of the Opposition say it,67
NA,Field-Marshal Montgomery has said that,67
NA,during the last war approximately,67
NA,"7,000,000 of the most virile members",67
NA,the Russian population were destroyed.,67
NA,Italy and Germany have been totally,67
NA,"destroyed as fighting forces, and those",67
NA,countries no longer have the capacity,67
NA,manufacture the equipment that is necesthat,67
NA,sary to fight a war. Those are facts that,67
NA,"cannot, be denied. The Government has",67
NA,every reason to be pleased with the led,67
NA,progress that has been made during the,67
NA,last twelve months in the implementation,67
NA,"of its defence policy. ""We have made",67
NA,attempt to deceive members of the OppoThis,67
NA,sition or the Australian people. The,67
NA,figures that I have given are accurate.,67
NA,The number of members of the Citizen,67
NA,"Military Forces is gradually increasing,",67
NA,the rate of increase is a little,67
NA,less than I should like it to be. The,67
NA,number of enlistments into the Citizen,67
NA,Forces during the last four,67
NA,weeks has been greater than the numiber,67
NA,an of enlistments during any of the last,67
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,Ther e were,67
NA,five enlistments in Soutb Australia last,67
Mr CHAMBERS , I do not know the,67
NA,"figure for last week, but I know that in",67
NA,the week Before that there were 60 enlist-,67
NA,I n ments. I n 1939 there were approxi-,67
NA,"mately 27,000 members of the Citizen",67
NA,Forces and the Permanent,67
NA,Military Forces in Australia. At the,67
NA,"time tliere are over 30,000 men in",67
Mr MENZIES ,Kooyong-Leade r of,67
NA,the Opposition) [5.28] - I had not,67
NA,intended to make a speech upon this,67
NA,"matter, but the remarkable utterances of",67
NA,the Minister for the Army ( Mr.,67
NA,Chambers) have brought me to my feet.,67
NA,One thing that I can say in favour of the,67
NA,honorable gentleman is that most of the,67
NA,that he has discussed are matters,67
NA,of which he has no first-hand knowledge.,67
NA,"The Hs may, therefore, be pardoned for",67
NA,having fallen into error about them. I,67
NA,shall not repeat what was said very effec-,67
NA,tively by the honorable member for,67
NA,Henty ( Mr Gullett) about the present,67
NA,state of affairs; but I shall say some-,67
NA,thing about the Minister's estimate of,67
NA,our present danger and his remarkable,67
NA,is. travesty of the events that occurred,67
NA,before the last war. The Australian,67
NA,Labour party has been lying its way,67
NA,"of along on this matter for much too long,",67
NA,and something ought to be said about it.,67
NA,"First, I shall say something about the",67
NA,to present danger. The Minister has said,67
NA,"Italy, Germany and Japan are dis-",67
NA,armed. I f one accepted the statements of,67
NA,"the Minister at face value, one would be",67
NA,to believe that the danger in the world,67
NA,to-day is very small. Let me say frankly,67
NA,and at once that as a military force Italy,67
NA,no has been non-existent for many years.,67
NA,country can afford to look back with,67
NA,some satisfaction on the fact that one,67
NA,"Australian division, the 6th Division,",67
NA,cleaned up a quarter of a million Italians,67
NA,in Cyrenaica. Whatever may be said,67
NA,"about the Italians, who are in many",68
NA,"respects most civilized people, they can-",68
NA,not be regarded very seriously as a fightingthis,68
NA,force. Is Eussia quite so innocent as the,68
NA,Minister would have us believe ?,68
Mr CHAMBERS , I did not say that.,68
Mr MENZIES ,"O h the contrary,",68
NA,the Minister was at great pains to tell us.,68
NA,on the authority of Field Marshal,68
NA,"Montgomery, that 7,000,000 Eussians were",68
NA,"destroyed during the last war and that,",68
NA,"presumably, Eussia is no longer quite the",68
NA,menace that honorable memhers on this,68
NA,side of the chamber may think i t is.,68
NA,The fact is that during tbe last three,68
NA,years the world has been almost standing,68
NA,"to arms. Why? Is i t because of Italy,",68
NA,Japan or Germany? Or is i t because of,68
NA,Eussia? The whole world has been in a,68
NA,state of grievous uncertainty and danger,68
NA,dui'ing the last three years because of the,68
NA,power and aggressive capacity of the,68
NA,"Soviet Union. Nevertheless, we have",68
NA,lived long enough to hear a Minister for,68
NA,the Army tell us in this Parliament that,68
NA,the dangers are not to be overestimated,68
NA,and that in reality they were much,68
NA,greater in 1938 and 1939 than they are,68
NA,now. That is the honorable gentleman's,68
NA,case. I always like to meet a man on bis,68
NA,own ground. Let us assume that the,68
NA,dangers were much greater in 1938 and,68
NA,1939 than they are now. Under those,68
NA,"circumstances, will the Minister under-",68
NA,take to explain to the people of tbis,68
NA,"country why his respected colleague, who",68
NA,is now the Minister for Labour and,68
NA,"National Service, said in this chamber,",68
NA,"on the 3rd November, 1938, ten months",68
NA,before war broke out-,68
NA,Tlie Government is expending much too,68
NA,rupidly on defence. I t is making plans for,68
NA,more than the adequate defence of Australia.,68
Mr CHAMBERS , I am not responsible,68
NA,for what the honorable gentleman said.,68
Mr MENZIES ,I f the Minister for,68
NA,the Army will wash his hands of all that,68
NA,the members of his party have said and,68
NA,will acquit honorable gentlemen on this,68
NA,side of the chamber of everything that,68
NA,"any body has ever said, from Sir",68
NA,"William Angliss downwards, we shall said",68
NA,once more meet on common ground. The,68
NA,Minister has taken the responsibility,68
NA,saying tbat before the last war honorable,68
NA,gentlemen who are now in Opposition,68
NA,were unaware of the danger and perobligations,68
NA,formed inadequately. He has said that,68
NA,they did not do anything like as well as,68
NA,Government is now doing. I say,68
NA,"to him that his colleague, who is now his",68
NA,"colleague in the present Cabinet, said",68
NA,exactly what I bave just quoted. A little,68
NA,of modern history will do the Minister,68
NA,no harm. I f he will look back upon the,68
NA,speeches that were made in 1938 in this,68
NA,"chamber, he will discover tbat a greatly",68
NA,respected leader of the Labour party at,68
NA,"that time, the late John Curtin- a man",68
NA,about whom I always speak with respect,68
NA,-sai d after Munich that the events of,68
NA,Munich did not justify the increase of,68
NA,defence preparations that the Lyons Go-,68
NA,"vernment was putting in hand, but a",68
NA,"reduced preparation, because the danger",68
NA,had been lessened.,68
NA,"Mr Chambers interjecting,",68
Mr MENZIES ,Th e Minister may,68
NA,squirm as much as he likes.,68
NA,"Mr Lemmon interjecting,",68
Mr MENZIES , I do not care if he,68
NA,"calls to his assistance "" The Man from",68
NA,"Snowy River "".",68
Mr FULLER ," I shall be there, too.",68
Mr MENZIES , I shall not need to,68
NA,call out reinforcements to deal with the,68
NA,honorable member for Hume ( Mr.,68
NA,Fuller). Let the Minister call up all his,68
NA,"reinforcements. The fact is that, i f the",68
NA,Labour party had been responsible for,68
NA,the affairs of this country in 1938 and,68
NA,"1939, we sbould have made no prepara-",68
NA,"tions for war. Now honorable gentlemen,",68
NA,"opposite say, "" Do not criticize us "". The",68
NA,Mmister for Works and Housing ( Mr.,68
NA,"Lemmon) says, ""Do not blame me. I",68
NA,"was not here "".",68
Mr LEMMON , I did not say that.,68
Mr MENZIES , Apparently the,68
NA,Minister for Works and Housing accepts,68
NA,responsibility for what was then done by,68
NA,members of his party. He cannot have,68
NA,it both ways. He either shuffles out of,68
NA,the responsibility for it or stands up,68
NA,to what his own leaders said at that,68
NA,time. I f members of the Labour party,68
NA,are to stand up to what their leaders,68
NA,"at that time, I say that those leaders",68
NA,were anti the possibility of war and anti,68
NA,"of the preparations for war. To be told,",68
NA,"in this year of grace, by these people",68
NA,that we failed to understand what the,68
NA,were then is the most ironical,68
NA,"-.thing that I have ever heard. Indeed,",69
NA,".1 shall pursue that line f o r a few minutes,",69
NA,'.because i t is time that the people of,69
NA,Australia were reminded of a few of these,69
NA,"rmatters. When war broke out i n 1939,",69
NA,-did the Lahour party support the forma-,69
NA,tion of the second Australian Imperial,69
NA,Eorce ?,69
Mr BLAIN , C e r t a i n l y not!,69
Mr MENZIES , T h e Labour party,69
NA,-was opposed to the constitution of the,69
NA,second Australian Imperial Force.,69
Mr WHITE , T h e Labour party was,69
NA,.also opposed to the Empire air training,69
NA,--scheme.,69
Mr MENZIES , I shall come to that.,69
NA,I n the twelve months preceding the out-,69
NA,"break of war, there had been a great",69
NA,"""testing of national recruitment i n this",69
NA,-country- a testing upon which the then,69
NA,"Prime Minister, Mr Lyons, had decided.",69
NA,"He had a feeling, and one can f u l l y",69
NA,";appreciate i t , that we should test out the",69
NA,"voluntary system to the f u l l , and so he",69
NA,".said, "" We shall raise a large force of",69
NA,"volunteer troops i n this country"". A",69
NA,;great recruiting campaign was put i n,69
NA,"hand. M y distinguished colleague, the",69
NA,right honorable member f o r N o r t h,69
NA,'Sydney ( Mr Hughes) w i l l remember i t,69
NA,vividly. D i d that campaign have the,69
NA,approval of our present masters? N o t,69
NA,-at a l l ! D i d i t succeed? I t did. The,69
NA,largest volunteer force that this country,69
NA,has had i n time of peace was formed.,69
Mr CHAMBERS , I n what year?,69
Mr MENZIES , I am speaking of,69
NA,193S-39.,69
Mr CHAMBERS ,Wa r was,69
Mr MENZIES , I am delighted to,69
NA,"have the Minister's view on that, because",69
NA,I should like h i m to know that most of,69
NA,the members of the Labour party at that,69
NA,time did not consider that war was i m m i-,69
NA,"nent. On the contrary, they thought",69
NA,that the whole danger had been disposed,69
NA,-of. Then war broke out. What you,69
NA,may do i f war is imminent is one thing.,69
NA,B u t what are you to do when war occurs ?,69
NA,"A f t e r all, that is something whioh speaks",69
NA,-eloquently to the dullest intelligence. War,69
NA,"broke out, and a l l sorts of problems",69
NA,"-emerged. The first was, "" Shall we re-",69
NA,introduce compulsory m i l i t a r y train-,69
NA,"ing ?"" Where did the Labour party",69
NA,stand on that? Honorable members,69
NA,opposite were opposed to the re-intro-,69
NA,duction of compulsory m i l i t a r y training.,69
NA,"I t is quite true that, when the system",69
NA,"was re-introduced, members of the Labour",69
NA,party discovered that the people of Aus-,69
NA,"tralia thought well of i t , and thereafter",69
NA,they went very quietly on that point.,69
NA,But I say that they were opposed to the,69
NA,re-introduction of compulsory m i l i t a r y,69
NA,training. H a d they been i n office at,69
NA,"the time, i t would not have been re-",69
NA,introduced. The next development was,69
NA,the formation of the second Australian,69
NA,Imperial Force. Honorable members,69
NA,w i l l permit me a few reflections of my,69
NA,own on tbis matter. I recall that there,69
NA,was a time i n 1942 when the Labour,69
NA,Government assumed great credit f o r,69
NA,bringing back to Australia the magnifi-,69
NA,cent divisions of tbe second Australian,69
NA,Imperial Force. What the people per-,69
NA,"haps have forgotten is that, i f members",69
NA,of the Australian Labour party had hacl,69
NA,"their way, not one unit or troop of the",69
NA,Australian Imperial Force would have,69
NA,been i n existence. The second Australian,69
NA,Imperial Force was formed i n the teeth,69
NA,of their opposition.,69
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,An d members,69
NA,of the Labour party opposed the despatch,69
NA,of the second Australian Imperial Force,69
NA,overseas.,69
Mr MENZIES , I shall come to that.,69
NA,"I remind the committee, i f the committee",69
NA,"needs the reminder, that the 6th Division,",69
NA,"the 7th Division, the 8th Division, the",69
NA,9th Division and the Armoured Division,69
NA,were constituted by non-Labour adminis-,69
NA,trations.,69
NA,imminent.,69
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON , I t should be,69
NA,emphasized that the Labour party opposed,69
NA,the despatch of the second Australian I m -,69
NA,perial Force overseas.,69
Mr MENZIES , I myself am rather,69
NA,familiar with that story.,69
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,S o am I .,69
Mr MENZIES ,"On e fine day, I , as",69
NA,"Prime Minister, announced that the first",69
NA,formations of the second Australian I m -,69
NA,perial Force would go abroad. What,69
NA,did the Labour party do then? I t sub-,69
NA,mitted a motion i n this Parliament pro-,69
NA,testing against the despatch of the second,69
NA,"Australian Imperial Force overseas, and",69
NA,pushed i t to a division on party lines. I n,69
NA,"other words, had the matter been l e f t to",69
NA,"the Labour party, there would have been",70
NA,"no compulsory military training, no",70
NA,"second Australian Imperial Force, and",70
NA,no despatch of the second Australian Im-,70
NA,"perial Force abroad. ""We have become",70
NA,familiar in these days with the allegation,70
NA,that we dispersed the strength of this,70
NA,country in foreign fields.,70
NA,The next reference that I make is to,70
NA,the introduction of the Empire air train-,70
NA,ing scheme. I have lived long enough to,70
NA,hear Ministers claim great credit for that,70
NA,achievement. I t was initiated in Great,70
NA,"Britain in 1939, and the first represen-",70
NA,"tative of Australia to discuss, on the spot,",70
NA,the details of that great scheme was the,70
NA,late J. V. Fairbairn. The Empire air,70
NA,"training scheme was adopted, and Aus-",70
NA,tralia set about doing its share. I t was,70
NA,the greatest single co-operative movement,70
NA,between the units of the British Empire in,70
NA,the course of a war. Although the scheme,70
NA,"began in October, 1939, i t was not until",70
NA,"July, 1940, that a conference of the Aus-",70
NA,tralian Labour party decided that it would,70
NA,permit members of the Labour party in,70
NA,this Parliament to support the scheme.,70
NA,The Minister for the Army has told us,70
NA,that the Government's defence programme,70
NA,is much better than the defence pro-,70
NA,gramme before the outbreak of war.,70
Mr CHAMBERS ,Tha t is right.,70
Mr MENZIES , I do not blame the,70
NA,"Minister for expressing that view, because",70
NA,he has had this story pedalled up to him,70
NA,year after year for a long time. The,70
NA,whole of the socialist story in Australia,70
NA,"may be expressed, thus, "" Of course the",70
NA,Opposition parties did nothing to prepare,70
NA,"Australia for war, and the Labour party",70
NA,"had to save the country "". I do not need",70
NA,to be told by Johjinies-Come-Lately who,70
NA,did this job in Australia. I say categoric-,70
NA,ally that the greatest munitions organiza-,70
NA,"tion that this country has ever had, was",70
NA,given into the hands of the Labour party,70
NA,at the end of 1941. Tbe incoming Go-,70
NA,vernment kept all the plans and all the,70
NA,men. I t did not sack them. Labour Min-,70
NA,"isters had enough wit to say, "" We shall",70
NA,"keep the plans, the men and the organiza-",70
NA,"tion, and allow them to work"". They",70
NA,were given tbe second Australian Imperial,70
NA,"Force, to which they did not add one",70
NA,ounce. They were given the system of com-,70
NA,L43],70
NA,"pulsory military training, which they",70
NA,developed later. They were given the,70
NA,Empire air training scheme and the whole,70
NA,"nucleus- a very big nucleus, too-o f the",70
NA,most marvellous co-operative effort that,70
NA,involved the most desperate struggles to,70
NA,secure training aircraft and all sorts of,70
NA,jdant from other parts of the world. I,70
NA,I have lived long enough now to assess at,70
NA,its true value all this chatter-thi s boast-,70
NA,ing chatter-o f the last four or five years,70
NA,by people who did not create anything,70
NA,but wbo took what had been created for,70
NA,"them. They now have the gall to say,",70
NA,""" We are doing a marvellous job. During",70
NA,the war you members of the present,70
NA,Opposition parties failed. You were not,70
NA,"ready for war. You had no army, navy",70
NA,or air force. I t is quite true tbat i f we,70
NA,"had had' our way, Australia would have",70
NA,"had nothing-minus, but that does not",70
NA,prevent us from saying that the Opposi-,70
NA,tion parties have been tried and have,70
NA,"failed "". That is the greatest piece of",70
NA,imposture that bas ever been put over the,70
NA,people of Australia.,70
Mr LEMMON ,Th e Opposition parties,70
NA,put their case to the people in 1943.,70
Mr MENZIES ,Th e truth is not,70
NA,always promptly received.,70
Mr LEMMON ,Th e people were not,70
NA,convinced by the Opposition parties in,70
NA,1943.,70
Mr MENZIES ,I t is one of my great,70

Mr DEDMAN ,Corio-Ministe r for,70
NA,Defence and Minister for Post-war,70
NA,Reconstruction) [5.45] -The Leader of,70
NA,the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) bas re-,70
NA,lated his remarks to the measure of the,70
NA,"danger of war to-day, and to a comparison",70
NA,of our present position with our position,70
NA,prior to the outbreak of war in 1-939. The,70
NA,right honorable gentleman has en-,70
NA,deavoured to confuse the minds of honor-,70
NA,able members by making a comparison,70
NA,of the responsibilities of a govern-,70
NA,ment and the responsibilities of an opposi-,70
NA,"tion, particularly in relation to defence",70
NA,matters. The right honorable gentleman,70
NA,knows perfectly well that the government,70
NA,of the day always bas possession of far,70
NA,more information tban is at the disposal,70
NA,of the Leader of the Opposition and the,70
NA,"Opposition party generally. Of course,",71
NA,there is a distinction between the Opposi-,71
NA,tion on this occasion in relation to our,71
NA,"preparedness o'f war, if there is a danger",71
NA,"of war now, and the attitude of the",71
NA,Labour party in relation to our prepared-,71
NA,ness before the outbreak of World War,71
NA,II . The Opposition to-day is alleging,71
NA,tbat this -Government's preparations for,71
NA,war are insufficient and that the Labour,71
NA,"party, when in opposition in the years",71
NA,"before tbe outbreak of World War IL ,",71
NA,maintained that our preparations for war,71
NA,then were rather greater than the occa-,71
NA,"sion warranted, with this exception, that",71
NA,"the late Mr John Curtin, during the",71
NA,whole of the time that he was Leader of,71
NA,"the Opposition, insisted that a much",71
NA,larger air force should be established in,71
NA,this 'country than that which the Govern-,71
NA,ment had planned.,71
Mr THOMPSON ,Tha t was in 1936.,71
Mr DEDMAN ,Al l honorable mem-,71
NA,bers know that tbat is a fact.,71
Mr MENZIES ,The y do not.,71
Mr DEDMAN ,Ba t it is a fact.,71
NA,Leader of the Opposition had a good,71
NA,deal to say about truth. What he says 1938.,71
NA,"is really a statement of his own opinion,",71
NA,and there can be quite a distinction,71
NA,between a statement of his opinion and,71
NA,what eventually proves to be the truth.,71
Mr WHITE ,Th e Labour party,71
NA,opposed the Estimates for the Department,71
NA,of Air before the outbreak of World Archie,71
NA,War II .,71
Mr DEDMAN ,Ever y bonorable,71
NA,"niember, in his heart, knows, and",71
NA,"Australian public certainly know, that",71
NA,"the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr.",71
NA,"Curtin, always made out a strong case",71
NA,for increasing the strength of tbe Eoyal imminent.,71
NA,Australian Air Eorce. There can be no,71
NA,comparison of the danger of war tbat,71
NA,"to-day, and the danger of war in 1938-39.",71
NA,"As I have said, the government of the",71
NA,day is always in possession of information,71
NA,that is not availahle to the Leader of,71
NA,Opposition and to members of the Oppowar,71
NA,sition parties generally; but I tbink,71
NA,it is common knowledge that there is,71
NA,responsible authority anywhere in the,71
NA,world that expects that there will be a,71
NA,"waT within the next five years, and",71
NA,"""""-«at many authorities",71
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,I s not war,71
NA,"raging in China, or are those campaigns",71
NA,only manoeuvres?,71
Mr DEDMAN ,Doe s the honorable,71
NA,gentleman consider that Australia should,71
NA,intervene in the struggle in China?,71
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON , I thought that,71
NA,the Minister said that there is no sign,71
NA,of war.,71
Mr DEDMAN , I say that respon-,71
NA,sible opinion generally throughout the,71
NA,world to-day is along the lines that there,71
NA,will not be another major -war for at,71
NA,"least five years, and it is quite improbable",71
NA,that for a much longer period than that,71
NA,there will be a war that will involve Aus-,71
NA,"tralia, the Tjnited Kingdom and the",71
NA,Tjnited States of America.,71
Mr WHITE ,The n we have not long,71
NA,to go.,71
Mr DEDMAN ,Ther e was a shorter,71
NA,time to go i n 1938.,71
Mr HAMILTON , The Minister,71
NA,opposed defence preparations in 193S.,71
Mr DEDMAN ,Th e honorable mem-,71
NA,The ber does not know what he is talking,71
NA,about. I was not i n this Parliament in,71
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,Th e Minister,71
NA,"was not in the Labour party, either.",71
Mr DEDMAN ,"A t any rate, I have",71
NA,been in the Labour party longer than the,71
NA,honorable member for Barker ( Mr.,71
NA,Cameron) has been in the Liberal,71
NA,"party. As I have said, the international",71
NA,situation in .1938 was fraught with,71
NA,danger. Everybody knew that war was,71
NA,the inevitable within a very short time.,71
Mr WHITE ,Member s of the Labour,71
NA,party at that time said that war was not,71
Mr DEDMAN , I have already said,71
NA,members of the Opposition are never,71
NA,in possession of all the information that,71
NA,is available to the Government. At that,71
NA,"time, every government had access -to in-",71
NA,the formation which supported the view that,71
NA,was inevitable. Much of tbat infor-,71
NA,that mation has since become common,71
NA,"no property, yet defence preparations in",71
NA,Australia at that time were not nearly,71
NA,"so efficient as are those in Australia now,",71
NA,a when the danger of war is not nearly so,71
NA,great.,71
Mr FRANCIS ,"Russi a has 5,000,000",72
NA,troops under arms.,72
Mr DEDMAN ,Th e honorable mem-,72
NA,ber for Moreton ( Mr Francis) is always,72
NA,talking about the number of troops that,72
NA,various governments have at their dis-,72
NA,posal. He is still living in tbe dark ages,72
NA,when wars were fought with man-power,72
NA,alone. Wars are now fought witb man-,72
NA,"power, plus industrial capacity. Every",72
NA,well-informed person knows to-day that,72
NA,the Tjnited States of America is so power-,72
NA,"ful industrially that no other nation, nor",72
NA,"any combination of nations, could success-",72
NA,fully wage war against it. The United,72
NA,States of America would inevitably win,72
NA,any war that might be begun within the,72
NA,"next 5, 10 or even 25 years. Russia",72
NA,is so far behind in industrial poten-,72
NA,tial that it will take at least ten,72
NA,years for that country to reach the posi-,72
NA,tion which the United States of America,72
NA,"occupies to-day. By that time, the",72
NA,United States of America will be still,72
NA,as far ahead' as it is now.,72
NA,The Leader of the Opposition said that,72
NA,his government re-introduced compulsory,72
NA,"military service, and organized divisions",72
NA,of the Australian Imperial Force to go,72
NA,'overseas. I t is true that the Labour,72
NA,party opposed) the sending of so many,72
NA,"troops overseas, because it was believed",72
NA,"that they were needed at home, a fact",72
NA,which was admitted by some of the mem-,72
NA,bers of the present Opposition at that,72
NA,"time, or very soon afterwards. For",72
NA,example; the bonorable member for,72
NA,"Warringa-h ( Mr Spender)-, when he was",72
NA,"Minister for the Army, said in this House",72
NA,that i f one Japanese armoured division,72
NA,had landed in Australia it could have,72
NA,overrunthe whole country.,72
Mr BI,AIN -Tha t was said at a secret,72
NA,meeting of members of the Parliament.,72
Mr DEDMAN ,"Perhaps , but I am",72
NA,not disclosing information given at a,72
NA,secret meeting. I t is public property,72
NA,the honorable member for Warringah,72
NA,said that i f one Japanese armoured,72
NA,division had landed in Australia it could,72
NA,have overrun the country. I do not,72
NA,think that anything is to be gained by,72
NA,raking over old controversies. The Leader,72
NA,of the Opposition spoke in a derogatory,72
NA,"fashion of my colleague, the Minister for",72
NA,Works and Housing ( Mr Lemmon). He,72
NA,accused the Minister of shuffling on a,72
NA,particular issue. The Leader of the,72
NA,Opposition and the Leader of the Aus-,72
NA,tralian Country party ( Mr Fadden),72
NA,deserted their posts during the most,72
NA,critical period in Australia's history.,72
NA,Their parties had amajority in the House,72
NA,"of Representatives and in the Senate,",72
NA,but they both deserted their posts when,72
NA,the country was in danger. The Minister,72
NA,for Works and Housing cannot justly,72
NA,be accused of shuffling on any issue.,72
NA,He was not a member of the Parliament,72
NA,when the events to wbicb reference has,72
NA,been made took place. I t does not lie,72
NA,with the Leader of the Opposition or the,72
NA,Leader of the Australian Country party,72
NA,to make accusations against one of my,72
NA,colleagues when they themselves have been,72
NA,convicted at the bar of public opinion,72
NA,of the crime of desertion. That is a,72
NA,"crime which, ordinarily, a man never gets",72
NA,a> second chance to commit. I f the Leader,72
NA,of the Opposition and theLeader of the,72
NA,AustralianCountry party had been mem-,72
NA,bers of the armed! forces-whic h they,72
NA,"neves were-an d had deserted, they would",72
NA,"have been immediately sbot. Therefore,",72
NA,it is incomprehensible that they should,72
NA,accuse any one on this side of the,72
NA,committee of shuffling over defence issues.,72
NA,The Leader of the Opposition also said,72
NA,that the Labour Government had in-,72
NA,herited' an organization for the manu-,72
NA,"facture of munitions. That istrue, but",72
NA,"it can also be said that the government,",72
NA,which was led by the present Leader,72
NA,"of the Opposition, had as its slogan",72
NA,"""Business as usual"". The right honor-",72
NA,able gentleman's government organized,72
NA,"the manufacture of munitions, and was",72
NA,responsible for Australia's adherence to,72
NA,the Empire air training scheme; but,72
NA,side by side with that somewhat puny,72
NA,"achievement, it evolved the slogan "" Busi-",72
NA,"ness as usual"" during a critical period",72
NA,in the history of the country. At that,72
NA,"that time 250,000 persons, who could have",72
NA,been doing something for the defence of,72
NA,"Australia, were unemployed. That is",72
NA,the record of the Opposition parties as,72
NA,a government when the danger to Aus-,72
NA,tralia was much greater than it is to-day.,72
NA,The present Government is expending,72
NA,"more money on defence, and expending",72
NA,"it to better advantage, than did any",72
NA,previous government in peace-time. The,72
NA,money is not being expended merely upon,72
NA,enlisting persons iii the armed forces.,73
NA,I t is being expended c a the development of,73
NA,"new weapons, and on research, whilst",73
NA,the strength of the armed services is,73
NA,being maintained at a level higher than,73
NA,that of 1938. This Government has a,73
NA,very good record in regard to defence,73
NA,"preparations, and I repeat that the threat",73
NA,of war is much less imminent now than i t,73
NA,was at the time during which a previous,73
NA,government did less to prepare for the,73
NA,defence of the country.,73
NA,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,73
Mr DAVIDSON ,Capricornia) [8.0].,73
NA,-Afte r the honorable member for Henty,73
NA,( Mr Gullett) had trenchantly criticized,73
NA,Australia's defence training policy this,73
NA,"afternoon, the Minister for the Army",73
NA,( Mr Chambers) accused him of having in-,73
NA,dulged in party political propaganda and,73
NA,of having made a personal attack upon,73
NA,himself. Neither charge can rightly be,73
NA,"levelled against the honorable member,",73
NA,"because, for the last couple of years, ever",73
NA,since the Government enunciated its de-,73
NA,"fence policy, we have criticized it, not for",73
NA,tbe sake of indulging in party political,73
NA,"propaganda, but because we have a deep",73
NA,concern about what we consider to be the,73
NA,"inadequacy of the training programme,",73
NA,livery honorable gentleman on this side,73
NA,"who, by virtue of his own military service,",73
NA,"is, in some way, qualified to speak, has",73
NA,completely condemned the policy. Surely,73
NA,the Minister will realize that the criticism,73
NA,is directed as something far transcending,73
NA,"political propaganda, and therefore that",73
NA,it be heeded. But the Minister and his,73
NA,Cabinet colleagues refuse to listen to the,73
NA,criticism. The Minister buries his bead,73
NA,"ostrich-like in the sands of complacency,",73
NA,and refuses to face facts that ought to be,73
NA,obvious to any one witb knowledge of,73
NA,the subject of defence. I n reply to criti-,73
NA,"cism of Australia's defence policy, we",73
NA,"hear, from time to time, from bonorable",73
NA,"members opposite, the statement that",73
NA,"Australia, has never been better prepared",73
NA,to defend itself than it is at present.,73
NA,Ministers are particularly adept at mak-,73
NA,ing that claim. The Minister for De-,73
NA,fence ( Mr Dedman) is very fond of,73
NA,"booming it forth, but it will take more",73
NA,"than, tbat to convince the people of Aus-",73
NA,"tralia, especially those with knowledge of",73
NA,"the situation, that the Government's",73
NA,defence policy provides for the adequate,73
NA,defence of Australia. Another justifica-,73
NA,tion for its attitude that is advanced by,73
NA,"the Government is that Australia, in",73
NA,"conjunction with Great Britain, is doing",73
NA,a big job in developing the guided,73
NA,weapons testing range. That is essential,73
NA,"and the development cannot be decried,",73
NA,but it cannot take the place of a complete,73
NA,defence policy. I t is only a part of the,73
NA,"whole picture, many aspects of which are",73
NA,missing. The Government's attitude is,73
NA,based on the belief that the development,73
NA,of the atomic bomb and guided weapons,73
NA,"has, in some way, changed the basic",73
NA,character of warfare and Tendered un-,73
NA,"necessary trained soldiers, sailors and",73
NA,airmen.,73
NA,"We often hear remarks about ""push",73
NA,"""button warfare"" and other similar",73
NA,"fatuities. Throughout history, every",73
NA,time a revolutionary weapon has been,73
NA,"introduced, the same opinion has been",73
NA,voiced. I t was voiced when the blunder-,73
NA,"bus replaced bows and arrows, when",73
NA,cannons were developed and when air-,73
NA,craft and tanks were developed. Now,73
NA,that science has developed the atomic,73
NA,"bomb and guided weapons, we hear the",73
NA,same contention. Time has proved,73
NA,"suoh an attitude to be fallacious,",73
NA,and it will continue to be fal-,73
NA,lacious. Every one with a knowledge,73
NA,cf warfare knows that once ground has,73
NA,been taken highly-trained men are needed,73
NA,to hold it. No nation has been de-,73
NA,feated without being overrun by enemy,73
NA,"troops. Therefore, regardless of the",73
NA,"development of new weapons, we must",73
NA,have men trained to throw out an invader,73
NA,should one attempt to conquer us. The,73
NA,"present system is entirely inadequate,",73
NA,"not only to defend Australia properly,",73
NA,but also to enable i t to meet its obliga-,73
NA,tions as a major nation in the efforts to,73
NA,preserve world peace. I propose,73
NA,to refer only to the Army and,73
NA,to leave references to the Navy,73
NA,"and the Air Force, which I believe are",73
NA,"similarly placed, to other honorable mem-",73
NA,"bers, with experience in those arms, who",73
NA,are more competent than I am to talk,73
NA,about tbem. I t is not my intention to,73
NA,offer much criticism of the broad defence,73
NA,plan as distinct from tbe defence policy.,73
NA,I t is the policy that I regard as erroneous.,73
NA,The broad plan is that there shall be,73
NA,establislied in Australia a regular army,74
NA,consisting of a small highly trained,74
NA,"force, which, in peace-time will carry out",74
NA,all the functions necessarily carried out,74
NA,"by a regular army in peace-time, but",74
NA,"whicli, iu war-time, will be the nucleus",74
NA,of an army capable of adequately defend-,74
NA,"ing Australia. I n addition, a citizen",74
NA,force is to be established. I t will consist,74
NA,"of men who will remain citizens, but",74
NA,will be sufficiently trained to enable them,74
NA,efficiently to take their place in the army,74
NA,at short notice to defend Australia. I t,74
NA,"must be remembered that, in an emer-",74
NA,"gency, the fate o f ' Australia would",74
NA,"depend, not on the small regular army,",74
NA,"but on the citizen army, of whioh the-",74
NA,regular army would be the nucleus. I n,74
NA,order to determine the success of our,74
NA,"defence policy, we must assess the success",74
NA,that we have had in recruiting and train-,74
NA,"ing the citizen army. First, I point out",74
NA,that we are still operating on the volun-,74
NA,tary system. I have condemned the,74
NA,"system before, and I condemn it again.",74
NA,"TJnder it, the cream of our youth, those",74
NA,who love Australia and have a sense of,74
NA,"responsibility, are the ones who answer",74
NA,the call. That means that we are train-,74
NA,ing them to take the first blow.,74
NA,"M.r. DEDMAN -""Wil l compulsory mili-",74
NA,tary training be advocated by the Leader,74
NA,of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) in hi=,74
NA,policy speech?,74
NA,"Mr DAVIDSON"" -Th e Minister for",74
NA,Defence will know what is in the policy,74
NA,speech when it has been delivered. I,74
NA,need all the time that I have available to,74
NA,me to deal with the Government's defence,74
NA,policy. That policy has had a fair trial,74
NA,in the last eighteen months or so. Every,74
NA,one with any knowledge must admit tliat,74
NA,it has been found wanting. The Minister,74
NA,for thc Army ( Mr Chambers) said,74
NA,"to-day, in reply to a question, that of",74
NA,"the 50,000 men whom it was hoped to",74
NA,"enlist in the Militia, only 15,000 had been",74
NA,enlisted.,74
Mr CHAMBERS ,I t is a five-year plan.,74
NA,"M!r. DAVIDSON -Yes , the Govern-",74
NA,ment hopes to develop a militia force of,74
NA,"50.000 men in five years. On that basis,",74
NA,the Minister for the Army contended that,74
NA,"the enlistment of 15,000 in the first year",74
NA,or so was a good effort. I challenge that.,74
NA,We cannot afford to sit back complacently,74
NA,for five years hoping that we shall then,74
NA,have reached the stage at which we might,74
NA,be able to defend ourselves. Every one,74
NA,"realizes that a force of 50,000 men is",74
NA,too small for the defence of the country.,74
NA,We must have a reasonable force trained,74
NA,as quickly as possible. We cannot sit,74
NA,back and wait for four or five years. The,74
NA,Minister for Defence said that he was,74
NA,satisfied that there would be no war,74
NA,"witbin five years. I hope that he is right,",74
NA,but we must face the fact that the,74
NA,Russian bear may attack at any time.,74
NA,"Moreover, the Government cannot expect",74
NA,"the enlistment rate of 15,000 a year to",74
NA,continue. I t is obvious that no progress,74
NA,is being made with enlistments and that,74
NA,the force has reached its maximum under,74
NA,present conditions. My inquiries have,74
NA,"revealed that infantry battalions, which",74
NA,"have an establishment of 700 or 800 men,",74
NA,have a maximum strength of about,74
NA,"200. I n other words, the battalions are",74
NA,at about 25 per cent. strength.,74
NA,"Amazingly, the support units, such as the",74
NA,"artillery, are not attracting the enlist-",74
NA,ment that infantry battalions are attract-,74
NA,ing. Incoming troops barely balance the,74
NA,outgoing. Troops cannot be trained on,74
NA,imagination. I t is practically impossible,74
NA,to train a skeleton force. We must have,74
NA,reasonable numbers of men to enable,74
NA,"training to be carried on, particularly in",74
NA,the higher branches. I n an under-manned,74
NA,"unit, elementary training, such as",74
NA,"rifle drill, can proceed, but there is a",74
NA,"definite line, not much higher than that,",74
NA,beyond wbich instructors cannot go.,74
NA,As a result of a question that was asked,74
NA,this morning the fact was elicited that,74
NA,"about 5,000 men had left the Militia",74
NA,Forces. I have found that that decrease,74
NA,"is going on steadily all the time, and that",74
NA,the first flush of enthusiasm that existed,74
NA,when the recruiting programme started,74
NA,has gone. Men are beginning to drop out,74
NA,and unit commanders can do nothing,74
NA,about it. Apparently the only source left,74
NA,from wbich to make up the gap between,74
NA,"15,000 men and 50,000 men will be the",74
NA,young men who are now reaching,74
NA,military age. But I fear very much that,74
NA,the majority of those young men are not,74
NA,likely to offer themselves for voluntary,74
NA,"military service because of the fact that,",74
NA,as the present system is staggering to a,74
NA,"stop, the comment made to any one pro-",74
NA,"posing to join up will be, ""Don't be a",74
NA,"fool! Why offer? I t is not necessary"".",75
NA,Another reason that will operate against,75
NA,"further enlistments is, as the honorable",75
NA,member for Henty ( Mr Gullett) rightly,75
NA,"said earlier to-day, the fact that the",75
NA,Government used troops as strike breakers,75
NA,in the recent coal strike. I join with,75
NA,the honorable member for Henty in say-,75
NA,ing that no other action could have been,75
NA,taken that would have had such calamitous,75
NA,effects on our defence policy as the use of,75
NA,those troops had. That action should,75
NA,never have been taken except as a last,75
NA,resort to prevent the country from being,75
NA,"thrown into chaos, and I cannot accept",75
NA,any assertion tbat that was tbe position.,75
NA,The serious effects of that action on tbe,75
NA,recruiting programme are obvious to pro-,75
NA,bably all honorable members. When a,75
NA,young man informs his mother that he,75
NA,"intends to join the Militia she will say,",75
NA,"""What for? To be used as a strike",75
NA,"breaker?"" The Government's action in",75
NA,"using soldiers as strike breakers must,",75
NA,"I repeat, have a serious effect on an",75
NA,already unsuccessful scheme.,75
NA,I n his reply to the honorable member,75
NA,"for Henty the Minister, in an attempt to",75
NA,justify as far as possible the present de-,75
NA,fence policy claimed that there was plenty,75
NA,of equipment available. He had started,75
NA,out to say how splendidly the present,75
NA,position compared with the position before,75
NA,"the last war, but I noticed that he stopped",75
NA,at the subject of equipment. I am quite,75
NA,prepared to concede that the equipment,75
NA,now available for the training of both,75
NA,the Regular Army and the Militia Forces,75
NA,has never been better. But it is not tbe,75
NA,slightest use having a lot of splendid,75
NA,equipment i f it is only to lie in drill,75
NA,and ordnance stores. I f we have not the,75
NA,men to train in the use of that equipment,75
NA,we might as well not have it. I consider,75
NA,therefore that although it is a matter of,75
NA,congratulation that we at last have some,75
NA,"decent equipment, i t cannot be claimed",75
NA,that i t is something for which the Go-,75
NA,vernment should receive credit.,75
Mr HARRISON ,Som e of that equip-,75
NA,ment is surplus war material.,75
Mr DAVIDSON ,Som e of it is. I,75
NA,have seen a great deal of valuable equip-,75
NA,"ment, and i f men were trained in its use",75
NA,a great step forward would have been,75
NA,"taken. I n addition to equipment, we have",75
NA,plenty of fine instructors available at the,75
NA,present time to train the Militia. They,75
NA,are men wbo served in tbe last war and,75
NA,whose outlook is such that they are pre-,75
NA,pared to offer themselves as instructors,75
NA,"for the Citizen Forces, and many of them",75
NA,are indeed at present acting as instructors.,75
NA,They command the great respect of the,75
NA,young men whom they are training. The,75
NA,experience of tbese men sbould be used,75
NA,"to the utmost while it is available, but",75
NA,their enthusiasm is waning. There is a,75
NA,spirit of frustration growing among them,75
NA,because they are becoming' weary of the,75
NA,round of night parades and week-end,75
NA,bivouacs without sumcient men to train.,75
NA,We sball find that unless we do some-,75
NA,thing about getting men for those instruc-,75
NA,tors to train we shall lose their services.,75
NA,I f the Government's present policy con-,75
NA,tinues I consider that we shall be lucky,75
NA,"if we have even the present 15,000 militia-",75
NA,men at the end of the five-year period.,75
NA,I cannot accept the Minister's com-,75
NA,placent assurance that because of the,75
NA,"fact that in the first year we got 15,000",75
NA,recruits we sball obtain the required,75
NA,"50,000 by the end of another four years.",75
NA,All the evidence points to the fact that,75
NA,the momentum that was developed at the,75
NA,"start of the scheme has now been lost,",75
NA,and recruiting is actually now working,75
NA,in reverse because so many men are leav-,75
NA,ing the Citizen Forces. I said at the,75
NA,beginning of my remarks that my criti-,75
NA,cism does not arise from any desire to,75
NA,make political propaganda. This is far,75
NA,too serious a matter to be used as a basis,75
NA,"for political propaganda, because I",75
NA,believe that Australia is facing a steadily,75
NA,increasing menace. We were told by the,75
NA,halls Minister for the Army this afternoon,75
NA,that there was no particular menace,75
NA,facing us. He told us that Italy was,75
NA,""" out"" as a nation and that J apan was",75
NA,completely destroyed as a fighting force.,75
NA,He made various other statements of a,75
NA,like nature which suggested that there,75
NA,was no particular threat facing Aus-,75
NA,tralia. I need not deal with that matter,75
NA,at great length because tbe Leader of the,75
NA,Opposition ( Mr Menzies) has dealt with,75
NA,"it very successfully and conclusively, but",75
NA,I draw the attention of the committee to,75
NA,the fact that a red tide is steadily surging,75
NA,down through China at this very moment,75
NA,and there is no knowing when i t will,75
NA,stop moving. Already Great Britain has,75
NA,been forced to reinforce the defences of,76
NA,Hong Kong because of tnat threat. The,76
NA,position in the Netherlands East Indies,76
NA,"is, at the moment, indeterminate, and we",76
NA,do not know what will develop there.,76
NA,The statement that Japan has been com-,76
NA,pletely destroyed as a military power is,76
NA,a most dangerous one to be made,76
NA,by a man who holds the position of Min-,76
NA,ister for the Army.,76
Mr CHAMBERS ,I t is true never-,76
NA,theless.,76
Mr DAVIDSON , I do not know how,76
NA,any one who knows how Japan emerged,76
NA,50 years ago from the dark ages and was,76
NA,able to develop itself to a position where,76
NA,it could do what it did in the last war,76
NA,can say that that nation has been com-,76
NA,pletely destroyed as a fighting force.,76
NA,"From what I have seen, Japan, i f given",76
NA,"a free leg, could become in ten years",76
NA,a serious menace to Australia. I t is,76
NA,obvious that it will not he long before,76
NA,a peace treaty with Japan will be signed.,76
NA,The feelers are out already and it is,76
NA,obviously the desire of the United States,76
NA,to finalize such a peace treaty so that it,76
NA,may develop Japan into something in,76
NA,the nature of an ally. There have,76
NA,already been suggestions that Japan may,76
NA,be permitted a certain degree of re-,76
NA,armament. That is the thin end of the,76
NA,wedge. Let us remember that greedy eyes,76
NA,in Japan are turned towards New Guinea.,76
NA,Those honorable members who have been,76
NA,to Japan will bear me out in that,76
NA,statement. There are Americans in,76
NA,Japan who consider that one of the out-,76
NA,lets for surplus Japanese population lies,76
NA,in the direction of Australia. I n view,76
NA,of these facts-an d they are facts-th e,76
NA,statement that Japan has heen completely,76
NA,destroyed as a possible threat to Aus-,76
NA,tralia cannot be sustained.,76
NA,I n addition to the menace facing,76
NA,tralia which I have briefly outlined i,76
NA,must also be remembered that Australia,76
NA,has certain obligations under the North,76
NA,"Atlantic Pact, and lately there have been",76
NA,suggestions that a Pacific pact should,76
NA,brought into being. According to recent,76
NA,statements that have been published,76
NA,"appears as i f the United .States,",76
NA,previously was not very favorable to,76
NA,"suggestion for a Pacific pact, is now",76
NA,ing its thoughts to the development,76
NA,such a pact somewhat along tbe lines of,76
NA,the North Atlantic Pact. Australia,76
NA,would have to play a major part in such,76
NA,a pact. Having regard to Australia's pre-,76
NA,sent capacity for defence I ask,76
NA,whether we could expect America,76
NA,to place any great reliance upon,76
NA,this country as a partner in the Pacific.,76
NA,We should certainly not be in a position,76
NA,to do anything of a major nature in,76
NA,respect of taking any great share of the,76
NA,obligations which we might incur under,76
NA,such a pact. Yet the development of such,76
NA,a pact is vastly important. I f we could,76
NA,show that we were moving towards a,76
NA,"realization of our obligations, as New",76
NA,"Zealand has done, the likelihood of such",76
NA,a pact coming into existence would be,76
NA,increased.,76
NA,I conclude by placing a plea before the,76
NA,Minister for the Army to pay some atten-,76
NA,tion to tbe opinions expressed by honor-,76
NA,able members on this side of the com-,76
NA,mittee. I assure him that those opinions,76
NA,are not voiced for purely political pur-,76
NA,poses. They are based on sound know-,76
NA,ledge. I f the Minister would care to,76
NA,appoint a select committee of the House,76
NA,of Eepresentatives to investigate charges,76
NA,that the training of the militia forces is,76
NA,"not proceeding as it should be doing, and",76
NA,call in service chiefs who would not,76
NA,otherwise be in a position to speak their,76
NA,"minds, he would discover that there is",76
NA,a substantial basis for our charges. I m -,76
NA,provements in the scheme which would,76
NA,result from sucb an inquiry would lead,76
NA,to a development of Australia's defence,76
NA,policy so that this country could claim,76
NA,eventually that it was in a position to,76
NA,defend itself. That is not the position,76
NA,at present.,76
Mr SHEEHY ,Boothby) [8.25] -I t,76
NA,is necessary to take a thorough overall,76
NA,view of the whole defence position and,76
NA,Ausnot only one small aspect of it because,76
NA,t after all we speak here as the represen-,76
NA,tatives of a member of the British Com-,76
NA,monwealth of Nations. Honorable mem-,76
NA,bers opposite have displayed recently a,76
NA,be really anti-British attitude on every,76
NA,"occasion on which we, on this side",76
NA,"i t of the chamber, have mentioned the",76
NA,which British Empire. We must study this,76
NA,the matter in a large sense. The British,76
NA,turnEmpire is founded on a strong fighting,76
NA,of navy and a strong merchant navy. I t,76
NA,would be futile to say that defence of such,76
NA,a scattered Empire as ours could be main-,77
NA,tained without tbe existence of a strong,77
NA,British Navy. The Government has been,77
NA,criticized because of its attitude towards,77
NA,defence. An examination of the relevant,77
NA,figures will show that there is no basis,77
NA,for such criticism. Tbe Eoyal Australian,77
NA,"Navy now has a strength of 10,000 effec-",77
NA,tive personnel compared with a strength,77
NA,"of 5,000 effective personnel in 1939.",77
Mr WHITE ,Fiv e thousand of them,77
NA,are non-combatants.,77
Mr SHEEHY ,Th e honorable mem-,77
NA,ber for Balaclava ( Mr White) has been,77
NA,"at sea all his life, and so I can",77
NA,put a true value on his remarks.,77
NA,I f any one who has never been,77
NA,in the Navy can be said to be always,77
NA,"at sea, it is the honorable member",77
NA,"for Balaclava. The figure of 10,000",77
NA,members in the Eoyal Australian Navy,77
NA,is exactly double the number of men in,77
NA,the Navy when the defence magnates,77
NA,on the opposite side of the committee,77
NA,controlled the government prior to and,77
NA,"for the first two years of the last war,",77
NA,when they told us that the Pacific area,77
NA,was safe. Now those gentlemen say that,77
NA,this Government is not applying itself,77
NA,to the defence problem.,77
Mr HARRISON , I thought from the,77
NA,honorable gentleman's remarks that he,77
NA,did not intend to adopt a party political,77
NA,attitude to this matter.,77
Mr SHEEHY , I am not adopting a,77
NA,party political attitude. I am merely,77
NA,stating facts. The point is that as soon,77
NA,as we on this side advance concrete facts,77
NA,honorable members opposite start to,77
NA,squeal or laugh like hyenas. Let us con-,77
NA,sider what has been done by the,77
NA,present Government in respect of naval,77
NA,defence. The Menzies Government spent,77
NA,"£9,000,000 or £10,000,000 on naval con-",77
NA,"struction, but since 1947 the present Go-",77
NA,"vernment has expended £60,000,000 on",77
NA,naval defence. Honorable members oppo-,77
NA,site would have the people believe that,77
NA,this Government has not played its part,77
NA,in taking measures for the defence of,77
NA,this country. I n the Anzac Pact we,77
NA,"have agreed with our sister dominion,",77
NA,"New Zealand, to take joint measures",77
NA,for our protection and security. I under-,77
NA,stand that the fleets of the two dominions,77
NA,are now engaged on joint manceuvres.,77
NA,"off the Australian coast, in which they will",77
NA,gain experience in joint operations which,77
NA,would be of inestimable value should our,77
NA,countries again be plunged into war.,77
NA,That is merely another step that has been,77
NA,taken by the Labour Government in dis-,77
NA,charging its responsibilities for the,77
NA,defence of Australia. We have also,77
NA,reached an understanding with our great,77
NA,"ally, the Tjnited States of America, with",77
NA,regard to the defence of the Pacific area.,77
NA,Honorable members opposite have in-,77
NA,dulged in a good deal of criticism regard-,77
NA,"ing the aircraft carrier H.M.A.S. Sydney,",77
NA,which is the latest addition to the Eoyai,77
NA,Australian Navy. They have said that,77
NA,the vessel is already obsolete. Nothing,77
NA,could be further from the truth. I t is,77
NA,well known to most honorable members,77
NA,that after the laying of the keel of a,77
NA,vessel alterations are' frequently made,77
NA,in design and construction before the,77
NA,vessel is completed. I had an oppor-,77
NA,tunity to inspect a number of large air-,77
NA,craft carriers in Great Britain the con-,77
NA,struction of which had been deferred,77
NA,because of alterations in the original,77
NA,design. That is occurring continually in,77
NA,"the Mother Country, which is the home",77
NA,of the British Navy and which has taught,77
NA,the peoples of other nations howto man,77
NA,and use ships to the best advantage.,77
NA,I t i l l becomes honorable members oppo-,77
NA,site to criticize the efforts that have been,77
NA,made by this Government to honour its,77
NA,obligations to safeguard the defence of,77
NA,the Commonwealth. During World War,77
NA,"II . , when our fighting forces returned",77
NA,"from the Middle East, they had to be",77
NA,re-trained in order that they would be,77
NA,able to acquit themselves adequately in,77
NA,"jungle warfare, for which they had not",77
NA,"previously been trained. Similarly, in",77
NA,"the building of warships, frequent",77
NA,"changes of design are made, either to",77
NA,meet the requirements of service in cer-,77
NA,tain waters or to provide for variations,77
NA,in the design of armaments. Honorable,77
NA,members opposite would have the people,77
NA,believe that because a Labour govern-,77
NA,ment is in oflice in this country i t can,77
NA,not be trusted with the secrets of scientific,77
NA,warfare. I have never before listened,77
NA,to such claptrap as that. The simple fact,77
NA,is that Australia is to play an important,77
NA,part in the construction and development,77
NA,of secret war weapons. I had the privi-,78
NA,lege of listening to the British Defence,78
NA,Minister outline his views on the future,78
NA,of secret weapons in the defence of the,78
NA,British Commonwealth. No suggestion,78
NA,was made by him that Australia was,78
NA,mistrusted in this matter. On the con-,78
NA,"trary, he said that we must all work",78
NA,with those with whom we knew we can,78
NA,work amicably. The truth of that state-,78
NA,ment is borne out by the fact that Aus-,78
NA,tralia was subsequently selected as the,78
NA,proving ground for long-range weapons,78
NA,which are on the secret list. Honorable,78
NA,members opposite cloud and misconstrue,78
NA,the facts to suit their own purposes. They,78
NA,would have the Government reveal all its,78
NA,defence plans. I f that were done our,78
NA,potential enemies would be jubilant. I f,78
NA,tbe British Commonwealth is to survive,78
NA,every member of i t must develop a virile,78
NA,naval force. The British Navy has,78
NA,"always played an important part, not",78
NA,"only in the winning of wars, but also",78
NA,in the maintenance of peace. No one can,78
NA,say that the British Navy did not play,78
NA,a very important part in maintaining,78
NA,peace in tbe world in tbe period between,78
NA,the two world wars. I t is useless for,78
NA,honorable members opposite to indulge in,78
NA,destructive criticism of the kind that,78
NA,has marked their contribution to the,78
NA,debate on these Estimates. For the pre-,78
NA,"servation of our scattered Empire, it is",78
NA,essential that all its component parts,78
NA,shall play their part in developing naval,78
NA,strength to the utmost of tbeir ability.,78
NA,At least the Australian Labour Govern-,78
NA,ment can claim that it has played its part,78
NA,in that direction.,78
Mr FRANCIS ,Moreton) [8.38] - I,78
NA,propose to reply briefly to some of the,78
NA,remarks that were made by the honorable,78
NA,member for Boothby ( Mr Sheehy).,78
NA,Nobody can be satisfied that any branch,78
NA,of our armed services is satisfactory,78
NA,to-day. Everybody realizes that the future,78
NA,is fraught with great difficulties and that,78
NA,the possession of one aircraft carrier and,78
NA,a limited number of naval craft does not,78
NA,give us any cause for satisfaction. I f,78
NA,the honorable member for Boothby is,78
NA,satisfied with that state of affairs he bas,78
NA,no cognizance of the problems that beset,78
NA,us. The Government is much too com-,78
NA,placent in this matter. I n the very limited,78
NA,time at my disposal I propose to deal,78
NA,briefly with the failure of the Govern-,78
NA,ment to adopt an adequate and sound,78
NA,defence policy. The mere fact that a,78
NA,guided weapons range has been established,78
NA,"at Woomera, in South Australia, does not",78
NA,satisfy me that the Government is doing,78
NA,everything possible to take advantage,78
NA,of the latest developments in scientific,78
NA,warfare. The Minister for the Army ( Mr.,78
NA,Chambers) has said that the permanent,78
NA,"forces now number 15,500 personnel. I n",78
NA,answer to a question which I asked on,78
NA,the subject the honorable gentleman,78
NA,admitted that more than one-third of that,78
NA,. number are non-combatants. That means,78
NA,"that we have only approximately 10,500",78
NA,combatant personnel. The honorable,78
NA,"gentleman also admitted that 5,000 men",78
NA,had recently left the forces. That is a,78
NA,very sad story which does not justify,78
NA,the complacency that has been exhibited,78
NA,by the Government in relation to defence,78
NA,matters. On every occasion on which the,78
NA,Minister for Defence ( Mr Dedman) bas,78
NA,answered questions relating to defence or,78
NA,"has dealt with matters relating to defence,",78
NA,he has boasted that Australia now has a,78
NA,larger defence force than it has ever,78
NA,had in its history during a time of peace.,78
NA,Such statements can be characterized as,78
NA,irresponsible and dangerous nonsense.,78
NA,"In 1938, just prior to the outbreak of",78
NA,"World War II . , the right honorable mem-",78
NA,ber for North Sydney ( Mr Hughes) was,78
NA,requested by the Lyons Government to,78
NA,increase our militia forces from a total,78
NA,"strength of 30,000 to 75,000. At the",78
NA,right honorable gentleman's request I was,78
NA,given the task of assisting him in Queens-,78
NA,land. As the result of his efforts the,78
NA,militia forces of this country were,78
NA,increased beyond the target strength to,78
NA,"a total of 85,000. After three months'",78
NA,"training those 85,000 young men became",78
NA,the nucleus of the 2nd Australian,78
NA,Imperial Force which played such a,78
NA,prominent part in World War II . I,78
NA,invite honorable members to compare the,78
NA,strength of the militia forces in those days,78
NA,with the pitifully small permanent army,78
NA,that we have to-day. Surely the Minister,78
NA,for Defence cannot be satisfied with his,78
NA,efforts. How can he claim that he is,78
NA,perfectly satisfied with the manner in,78
NA,which the Government's five-year defence,78
NA,programme is being implemented? Dur-,78
NA,ing the eighteen months in which that,78
NA,programme has been in operation he has,79
NA,succeeded in enlisting a permanent army,79
NA,"of a total strength of only 15,000 of whom",79
NA,one-third are non-combatants. Honorable,79
NA,members on this side of the chamber and,79
NA,the people of Australia generally are dis-,79
NA,satisfied with the Government's defence,79
NA,policy.,79
NA,A great deal of time has been wasted by,79
NA,honorable members opposite in trying to,79
NA,convince the people that they should,79
NA,derive a great deal-of satisfaction from,79
NA,"the fact that, in conjunction with the",79
NA,"British Government, the Commonwealth",79
NA,has established a guided weapons range,79
NA,in South Australia. That project will,79
NA,make little or no contribution to the,79
NA,defence of Australia for some time to,79
NA,"-come. I t is merely experimental, and i f",79
NA,it is successful a long time will elapse,79
NA,before practical advantage can be taken of,79
NA,it. What this country wants more tban,79
NA,anything else at the moment is an army,79
NA,of skilled specialists to use the mechanized,79
NA,equipment with which modern wars are,79
NA,fought. Large numbers of trained per-,79
NA,sonnel wbo served in World War II . are,79
NA,willing and anxious to help to train young,79
NA,men in the use of modern equipment. The,79
NA,Minister should do everything possible to,79
NA,secure their services by making tbe con-,79
NA,ditions of service in the armed forces,79
NA,attractive. I have a gr'eat regard for,79
NA,"Lieutenant-General Savige, who is well",79
NA,known to every member of tbis Parlia-,79
NA,ment. Lieutenant-General Savige has,79
NA,been most forthright in his condemna-,79
NA,"tion of the state of our military forces,",79
NA,He does not bandy words. According to,79
NA,"the press, this great soldier, who served",79
NA,"witb distinction in the two world wars,",79
NA,is unequivocally dissatisfied with our,79
NA,militia forces as they exist to-day. He is,79
NA,reported to bave said recently-,79
NA,The Federal Government's failure to train,79
NA,an adequate number of men to use modern,79
NA,weapons of war was a menace to the safety,79
NA,Australia.,79
NA,How can Ministers remain complacent in,79
NA,the face of such a statement by a dis-,79
NA,tinguished Australian soldier?,79
NA,tenant-General Savige has spent a life-,79
NA,time in the service of his country. He,79
NA,was a member of the militia forces prior,79
NA,to World War I. and in the period,79
NA,between the two world wars. He rendered,79
NA,brilliant service to his country in both,79
NA,Mr Francis.,79
NA,world wars. The report to which I bave,79
NA,referred continues-,79
NA,Since tlie second world war there had been,79
NA,some big changes i n the science of war. Only,79
NA,by universal training would i t be possible to,79
NA,keep enough men abreast of these developments.,79
NA,Lieutenant-General Savige was commenting,79
NA,on a statement by the Prime Minister ( Mr .,79
NA,Chifley) that the Government had considered,79
NA,universal training and was of opinion that the,79
NA,present defence policy provided the maximum,79
NA,of security within the resources available.,79
NA,He said the present voluntary system of,79
NA,training was most obviously a failure-no t,79
NA,enough men were being trained.,79
NA,Those who were in charge of Australia's,79
NA,forces early in the last war knew how dangerous,79
NA,it was to t r y to properly t r a in men for battle,79
NA,after the enemy was on the march.,79
NA,I n the future i t would be more dangerous.,79
NA,There would be less time for men to learn how,79
NA,to use weapons of more intricate and scientific,79
NA,design.,79
NA,I n the last war the infantryman had dropped,79
NA,"his old role as a foot-slogger, and had become",79
NA,"a highly-trained specialist, using a great",79
NA,variety of scientific weapons.,79
NA,I t took a. long time to train these specialists.,79
NA,Australia was desperately short of them.,79
NA,Universal military training was the only,79
NA,answer.,79
NA,"I ask the Minister, in the interests of the",79
NA,"defence of Australia, to take note of the",79
NA,observations that have been made from,79
NA,time to time by a number of senior Aus-,79
NA,tralian officers who served in World War,79
NA,II . I appeal to tbe bonorable gentleman,79
NA,to ensure that we have forces that are,79
NA,adequate for the defence of this country.,79
NA,"On the 17th September, tbe American",79
NA,combined Senate Foreign Relations and,79
NA,Armed Services Committees stated that,79
NA,"Russia had more than 5,000,000 men in",79
NA,its armed forces. I n a joint report on,79
NA,"President Truman's arms programme, the",79
NA,committees said tbat Soviet ground,79
NA,forces were in a better condition now than,79
NA,at any time since tbe war. Other points,79
NA,in the committees' report were that,79
NA,Russia had increased its military budget,79
NA,"of by 19 per cent, since last year, tbat tbe",79
NA,number of Soviet troops in Germany had,79
NA,"increased from 70,000 to 100,000, and that",79
NA,the Soviet had intensified security,79
NA,Lieumeasures along its borders and those of,79
NA,its satellites. The Minister must be,79
NA,aware of the Russian advance in Asia.,79
NA,Russia was thwarted in Europe and has,79
NA,now turned to the east. Communist,79
NA,"forces are advancing in China, and are",79
NA,present in considerable numbers in the,79
NA,Netherlands East Indies and South-East,80
NA,Asia generally. This country cannot re-,80
NA,main complacent while Eussia is expand-,80
NA,ing its military forces and bringing the,80
NA,Iron Curtain closer to our coasts.,80
NA,Eussia is trying to ensure that nobody,80
NA,shall learn of what is being done behind,80
NA,"the Iron Curtain. ""We must strengthen",80
NA,our defence forces. We owe a duty to our,80
NA,young men to ensure that they are given,80
NA,an opportunity to receive military train-,80
NA,ing. We cannot expect that in the future,80
NA,otber countries will keep the enemy away,80
NA,from us while we are establishing our,80
NA,own defence forces.,80
Mr CHAMBERS ,Di d the honorable,80
NA,gentleman say that we cannot get behind,80
NA,the Iron Curtain?,80
Mr FRANCIS , I say tbat i t is dim-,80
NA,cut to learn what is being done there.,80
Mr CHAMBERS ,I f we cannot get be-,80
NA,"hind the Iron Curtain, how does the",80
NA,honorable gentleman know that the,80
NA,formation that he has given to the com-,80
NA,mittee is correct?,80
Mr FRANCIS , I have confidence,80
NA,in the efficiency of the American military,80
NA,organization. We saw i t in operation in,80
NA,Australia. We are indebted to i t for,80
NA,part that i t played i n the defence of,80
NA,this country and for the lessons that,80
NA,bave been able to learn from it. I,80
NA,lieve that the American combined Foreign done so.,80
NA,Relations and Armed Services Committees,80
NA,are very alarmed about the possibility,80
NA,of the maintenance of the future peace,80
NA,of the world. I believe that the report,80
NA,that they made to President Truman was,80
NA,made with the object of ensuring tbat,80
NA,steps will be taken to maintain the forces,80
NA,of the Tjnited States of America at tho,80
NA,highest possible degree of efficiency.,80
NA,According to the Minister for tho,80
NA,"Army, we have a regular army of 19,000",80
NA,men. I regard that force as a nucleus,80
NA,upon which to build. We must increase,80
NA,"the size of the militia forces, which",80
NA,"in my opinion, be required to shoulder",80
NA,the greatest burden i f war occurs. I f,80
NA,"approach this problem properly, we shall",80
NA,be able to establish a militia force,80
NA,will be worthy of Australia. I n 1938,80
NA,increased the size of the militia to,80
NA,"85,000 men, and I believe tbat we could",80
NA,do so again i f the necessary effort were,80
NA,made. Nobody who has the interests of,80
NA,this country at heart can be satisfied with,80
NA,tbe present position. I appeal to the,80
NA,Minister to accept the advice of senior,80
NA,"military officers, especially Lieutenant-",80
NA,"General Savige, who has stated that the",80
NA,lack of men in Australia who bave been,80
NA,trained in the use of modern weapons is,80
NA,a menace to the safety of this country.,80
Mr THOMPSON ,Hindmarsh) [8.50].,80
NA,- I f the speeches that have been made,80
NA,by honorable gentlemen opposite upon the,80
NA,proposed votes for the defence services,80
NA,"mean anything at all, they mean that",80
NA,"it is the intention of the Opposition, i f",80
NA,it is successful at the forthcoming general,80
NA,"election, to reintroduce compulsory mili-",80
NA,"tary training i n Australia. However,",80
NA,honorable gentlemen opposite have not.,80
NA,stated specifically that that is tbeir inten-,80
NA,tion. I ask them whether they are pre-,80
NA,pared to make that statement and let the,80
NA,people know where they stand.,80
Mr GULLETT ,O f course they are.,80
Mr THOMPSON , I want the honor-,80
NA,able member for Henty ( Mr Gullett) to,80
NA,make that statement officially.,80
Mr RANKIN ,Giv e us a chance.,80
Mr THOMPSON ,Ther e has been,80
NA,the ample opportunity for honorable gentle-,80
NA,men opposite to state plainly their inten-,80
NA,we tions i n connexion with compulsory,80
NA,"bemilitary training, but they bave not",80
NA,Before the sitting was suspended the,80
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies),80
NA,made a good speech. The right honorable,80
NA,gentleman was forced into the position,80
NA,of having to do his utmost to justify the,80
NA,actions before the war of the Government,80
NA,of which he was a member and to attempt,80
NA,to explain its failure i n the early years,80
NA,of the war. The right honorable gentle-,80
NA,man tried to blame the Labour party for,80
NA,the condition of the defence forces of this,80
NA,country at the outbreak of war in 1939.,80
NA,He quoted tbe words that were used by,80
NA,"will, some members of the Labour party when",80
NA,they were opposing proposals of the Go-,80
NA,we vernment that was i n office at that time.,80
NA,Neither tbe right honorable gentleman,80
NA,that nor bis predecessor as Prime Minister,80
NA,we was game enough then to do what he,80
NA,thought should be done. The Australian,80
NA,people will surely be puzzled by the,80
NA,attempt of the right honorable gentleman,80
NA,to blame a party that was in a minority,80
NA,in both houses of the Parliament for the,81
NA,failure of the Government prior to the,81
NA,outbreak of war to establish adequate and,81
NA,efficient defence forces in this country.,81
NA,The right honorable gentleman referred,81
NA,to the late John Curtin and his opposition,81
NA,to certain proposed defence measures.,81
NA,I n 1936 I served with Mr Curtin on,81
NA,a committee that drew up the defence,81
NA,policy of the Labour party for presenta-,81
NA,tion to the people at the 1937 general,81
NA,election. What Mr Curtin desired was,81
NA,an efficient air force. I ask honorable,81
NA,gentlemen opposite how efficient our air,81
NA,force was i n 1939.,81
Mr CONELAN ,W e had five Wirra-,81
NA,ways.,81
Mr THOMPSON ,A t outbreak of,81
NA,war in 1939 the air defences of this,81
NA,country were practically non-existent. I,81
NA,remember the night when it was,81
NA,announced that Prince of Wales and,81
NA,"Repv,lse had been sunk. Tbose ships were",81
NA,lost because we had no aircraft available,81
NA,to protect them from the attacks of,81
NA,Japanese aircraft.,81
NA,Honorable gentleman opposite are,81
NA,now claiming that there are not enough,81
NA,men in the defence forces. On other,81
NA,"occasions, as we know, they have",81
NA,said that there are not sufficient men,81
NA,employed in industry and that we are not,81
NA,constructing enough houses and ships.,81
NA,They blame the Government because there,81
NA,are not sufficient men to do the work that',81
NA,is needed for the development of this,81
NA,country. I believe in an efficient defence,81
NA,force,81
Mr GULLETT ,O f course the honorable,81
NA,member does not.,81
Mr THOMPSON ,Th e honorable,81
NA,gentleman may make statements of thai,81
NA,kind i f he desires to do so. I repeat that,81
NA,I believe in an efficient defence force,81
Mr GULLETT ,Tha t is utter humbug.,81
Mr THOMPSON ,I t was humbug,81
NA,for the bonorable meinber for Henty to,81
NA,attack the Minister for the Army ( Mr.,81
NA,"Chambers) in the way in which he did,",81
NA,and for the Leader of the Opposition .to,81
NA,claim that the government of which he,81
NA,was a member was not responsible for the,81
NA,"condition of our defence forces in 1939,-",81
NA,and to attempt to lay the blame for it on,81
NA,"the Labour party, wbich was then in",81
NA,Opposition. I n the debate on these Esti-,81
NA,mates honorable gentlemen opposite have,81
NA,been indulging in the tactics in which,81
NA,they have indulged for the last three,81
NA,years. On every occasion wben a member,81
NA,of the Opposition makes a speech in this,81
NA,chamber he endeavours to sow in the,81
NA,minds of the people the seeds of distrust,81
NA,and suspicion of the Government. He,81
NA,suggests that the Government will not,81
NA,protect the country by doing what is neces-,81
NA,sary for our defence and that i t will ruin,81
NA,us. Honorable gentlemen opposite must,81
NA,have a very poor opinion of the intelli-,81
NA,gence of the people i f they think that they,81
NA,will be misled by statements of that kind.,81
NA,Why was there a change of minis \ry,81
NA,in 1941? Honorable gentlemen opposite,81
NA,"talk of unity, but when the present Leader",81
NA,"of the Opposition was Prime Minister,",81
NA,the Leader of the Australian Country,81
NA,party ( Mr Fedden) also wanted to,81
NA,occupy the post and the right honorable,81
NA,member for North Sydney ( Mr Hughes),81
NA,said that he was the man for it.,81
NA,The people of Australia were wonder-,81
NA,ing who would be the man who would,81
NA,lead them in the war. Eventually,81
NA,two of the supporters of that Government,81
NA,"said, in effect, "" I f you are going to make",81
NA,such a poor showing by arguing amongst,81
NA,"yourselves, and i f you are going to",81
NA,"jeopardize the defence of Australia, we",81
NA,"shall turn you out of office "". They did so,",81
NA,"and a minority party, the Labour party,",81
NA,formed the Government. That minority,81
NA,party did such a wonderful job that it was,81
NA,returned to office witb a record majority,81
NA,at the 1943 general election. A t that tim«,81
NA,[ remember talking to men in trains and,81
NA,"in the streets. They said to me, ""We",81
NA,"want John Curtin"". They gave the",81
NA,party that was led by John Curtin a,81
NA,majority in this House that it had never,81
NA,had before. There were no fights in the,81
NA,ranks of the Labour party. Our fight was,81
NA,with the enemy. The members of the,81
NA,Menzies Government did not have the,81
NA,"guts to say to the people of Australia,",81
NA,""" We are going to make this an all-in",81
NA,war. Every man in the country must,81
NA,"play his part"". We did that in spite of",81
NA,the opposition of some members of our,81
NA,own party. We were prepared to do what,81
NA,was necessary for the defence of Aus-,81
NA,"tralia, and to take risks. Honorable",81
NA,gentlemen opposite often talk about tak-,81
NA,"ing risks, but when the parties to which",81
NA,they belong were i n power they were not,82
NA,prepared to take the risk of saying to,82
NA,"everybody i n Australia, whether they",82
NA,were serving i n the forces or engaged i n,82
NA,"industry or business, that they would have",82
NA,to play their part i n the war. On the,82
NA,"contrary they adopted the attitude,",82
NA,""" Business as usual f or the business man",82
NA,and let the volunteers carry on with the,82
NA,"fight"". The people of Australia are quite",82
NA,satisfied that the Labour Government has,82
NA,"shown, by deeds and not by words, that i t",82
NA,is prepared to do the job.,82

NA,I do not propose at tbis juncture,82
NA,refer to the administration of the Ministhat,82
NA,ter f or Repatriation ( Mr Barnard),82
NA,relation to the War Pensions Entitlement,82
NA,Appeal Tribunal and the War Pensions,82
NA,Assessment Appeal Tribunal. I pointed,82
NA,out on a previous occasion that the,82
NA,Minister decided to dismiss a tribunal,82
NA,"for having questioned his administrareports,",82
NA,"tion, and that he refused to accept a",82
NA,"report f r o m a tribunal, under threat",82
NA,"of dismissal, unless i t was prepared",82
NA,alter the document to conform to his,82
NA,own opinions. I mention those matters,82
NA,only to show that the remarks whieh T,82
NA,shall make about war pensions generally,82
NA,are completely consistent with the,82
NA,ter's failure to administer the Department,82
NA,of Repatriation i n a proper manner.,82
NA,The Australian Soldiers' Repatriation,82
NA,"Act, i n my opinion and in the opinion of",82
NA,quite a number of those who have some,82
NA,"knowledge of this matter, should be",82
NA,completely overhauled. The original act,82
NA,has been amended piece-meal since its,82
NA,introduction i n 1920 by the right,82
NA,honorable member f or Nort h Sydney,82
NA,"( Mr Hughes). However, the act and the",82
NA,regulations promulgated thereunder,82
NA,"have not been completely overhauled,",82
NA,"and as the result of two world wars, a",82
NA,considerable number of anomalies have,82
NA,"arisen, the general effect of which has",82
NA,been to penalize ex-service men and,82
NA,women. I t appears to me that ex-service,82
NA,men and women constitute one class,82
NA,which should receive sympathetic con-,82
NA,sideration fro m the Government. Unfor-,82
NA,"tunately, they receive scant considera-",82
NA,"tion from this Government, and possibly",82
NA,less consideration than otlier sections of,82
NA,the community receive. That impres-,82
NA,sion is held so widely among ex-service-,82
NA,men that the joint organization of,82
NA,ex-servicemen's associations has pre-,82
NA,pared what i t describes as a 33-point,82
NA,plan for submission to the Government.,82
Mr BARNARD , A 36-point plan.,82
Mr HARRISON , I accept the cor-,82
NA,"rection, because i t shows that the ex-",82
NA,serviceinen's organizations are dissatisfied,82
NA,about three other points i n addition to,82
NA,the 33 that are known to me. I f,82
NA,the representatives of ex-servicemen can,82
NA,indicate 36 points of the act which bear,82
NA,. harshly upon them and worsen their posi-,82
NA,tion compared with that of otlier sec-,82
NA,to tions of the community my contention,82
NA,the act should be completely over-,82
NA,i n hauled must stand unchallenged. The,82
NA,Minister stated that he informed the,82
NA,representatives of the joint organization,82
NA,of ex-servicemen's associations that the,82
NA,Government would not increase the rates,82
NA,of repatriation pensions. According to,82
NA,the Prime Minister ( Mr Chifley),82
NA,later confirmed the Minister's statement.,82
NA,The Government is more concerned with,82
NA,to providing social services benefits than,82
NA,with rendering simple justice to ex-,82
NA,service men and women by increasing the,82
NA,rates of the various categon'ps of war pnn-,82
NA,sions. I t seems that the Government,82
NA,Minisprefers that war pensions should be,82
NA,abolished aad that repatriation bene-,83
NA,fits and social services generally should,83
NA,be paid from the National Welfare,83
NA,Fund. That impression seems to be,83
NA,.borne out by the fact that the,83
NA,Government is keeping the rate of,83
NA,the war pensions static. While the,83
NA,"Government succeeds in doing so, it",83
NA,will be diverting to the National Wel-,83
NA,fare Fund money that should rightly be,83
NA,.allocated to increasing war pensions.,83
NA,I shall cite some examples. The per-,83
NA,centage of the national income which was,83
NA,expended in 1939 on pensions for those,83
NA,who had fought in the Boer War and,83
NA,World War I . is almost equal to tbe,83
NA,percentage of the national income that is,83
NA,now being expended on tbe payment of,83
NA,pensions to those who served in tbe,83
NA,"Boer War, World War I . and World",83
NA,War II . I t is a misnomer to refer to,83
NA,""" war pensions "". A war pension should",83
NA,be regarded as compensation to men who,83
NA,lost limbs or were broken in health as,83
NA,the result of serving their country in wars.,83
NA,Tbe payment is an obligation that the,83
NA,Government and the people should,83
NA,"assume. Of course, the Government does",83
NA,"not reeognize that fact aiid, in my opinion,",83
NA,it regards war pensions merely as an obli-,83
NA,"gation to be met by the payment, in many",83
NA,"instances, of the minimum rate. Since",83
NA,"the end of World War II . , the increase",83
NA,of war pensions has lagged far behind tbe,83
NA,"soaring cost of living, and the steady de-",83
NA,cline of the purchasing power of the war,83
NA,"pension is quite evident. However, the",83
NA,basic wage and tbe age and invalid pension,83
NA,have frequently been adjusted to meet,83
NA,the increasing cost of living. I mention,83
NA,"tbose points, because later I shall compare",83
NA,the increase of age and invalid pensions in,83
NA,"relation to the basic wage, with the in-",83
NA,crease of war pensions in relation to,83
NA,the basic wage.,83
NA,One of the anomalies which inflicts the,83
NA,greatest degree of hardship is that war,83
NA,pension rates are not suflicient to enable,83
NA,the recipients to maintain a reasonable,83
NA,"standard of living. Obviously, if wages",83
NA,"and costs rise, but war pensions remain",83
NA,"static, the recipients are penalized. Let",83
NA,consider how the purchasing power of the,83
NA,"100 per cent, war pension has been allowed",83
NA,"to fall, notwithstanding the fact that the",83
NA,national income per capita has increased,83
NA,since 1939 by approximately 86 per cent.,83
NA,Mr Harrison.,83
NA,Age and invalid .pensions have increased,83
NA,"by approximately the same percentage,",83
NA,"but the 100 per cent, war pension and the",83
NA,special war pension bave been increased,83
NA,"by only 30 per cent, in 10 years. The",83
NA,"10.0 per cent, war pension in 1939 was",83
NA,"£2 2s. a week, and at present i t is £2 15s.",83
NA,"a week, an increase of 31 per cent. The",83
NA,rate of the special war pension in 1939,83
NA,was £4 a week and to-day i t is £5 6s. a,83
NA,"week, an increase of 32.5 per cent. Honor-",83
NA,able members will see that my statements,83
NA,about the decline of the purchasing power,83
NA,of wav pensions are borne out by those,83
NA,figures. I shall now examine war pensions,83
NA,in relation to the basic wage in 1939,83
NA,and in August of this year. The 100 per,83
NA,"cent, war pension was £2 2s. a week, and",83
NA,the basic wage was £3 19s. a week in 1939.,83
NA,"In other words, tbe 100 per cent war pen-",83
NA,"sion was 53 per cent, of the basic wage at",83
NA,"that time. I n August, 1949, the basic wage",83
NA,"was £6 7s. a week and tbe 100 per cent,",83
NA,"war pension was £2 15s., or only 43",83
NA,"per cent, of the basic wage. Those of us",83
NA,who watch economic trends know that the,83
NA,basic wage will continue to be further in-,83
NA,"creased. I have no doubt that, before",83
NA,thc general election on tbe 10th December,83
NA,"next, the basic wage will be increased to",83
NA,£6 10s. a week. The 100 per,83
NA,"cent, war pension will have to be",83
NA,increased to 70s. a week if it is to,83
NA,bear tbe same relation to the basic wage,83
NA,now as it bore to the basic wage i n 1939.,83
NA,Tbe case for tbe increase is unanswerable.,83
NA,All civilian pensions and the basic wage,83
NA,have been adjusted in accordance with the,83
NA,"increased cost of living, but ex-servicemen,",83
NA,who have lost a limb or who have been,83
NA,broken in health through helping to,83
NA,preserve our democratic way of life and,83
NA,"our standard of living, are not being",83
NA,treated so sympathetically as civilian,83
NA,pensioners are. I do not desire to suggest,83
NA,that war pensions should rise or,83
NA,fall according to fluctuations in the cost,83
NA,of living. I do not suggest that the 100,83
NA,"per cent, pension rate should be adjusted",83
NA,automatically in accordance with varia-,83
NA,tions in cost of living figures. Perhaps,83
NA,"us the Minister, calling upon his imagina-",83
NA,"tion, could evolve some other method of",83
NA,"dealing with the problem. At any rate,",83
NA,it is clearly our duty to honour our obli-,83
NA,gations to the ex-servicemen wbo answered,83
NA,the call to defend their country. They,83
NA,should not be placed in a worse position,84
NA,than other sections of the community.,84
NA,"In 1939, the full war pension represented",84
NA,"53 per cent, of the basic wage; now it",84
NA,".represents only 43 per cent., and i f an",84
NA,adjustment is not made soon the disparity,84
NA,"will be still greater. I f the Treasurer,",84
NA,"whose coffers are overflowing, can grant",84
NA,concessions to other sections of the com-,84
NA,"munity, he can well afford to do justice",84
NA,to ex-servicemen.,84
NA,"Before the war, the Australian",84
NA,Soldiers'' Repatriation Act was amended,84
NA,to provide that wives of ex-service-,84
NA,"men, who married ' after the 30th",84
NA,"June, 1938, should be excluded from bene-",84
NA,"fits under the act. The Minister, no",84
NA,"doubt, will remind me that the amend-",84
NA,ment was made while a government which,84
NA,"I supported was in power. That is so,",84
NA,but the amendment has led to some,84
NA,"anomalies, and I have here particulars of",84
NA,a case in point. An ex-serviceman has,84
NA,written to me in these terms-,84
NA,1 w i l l t r y to point out the injustice by,84
NA,stating my own case.,84
NA,I married i n December 1941 and refrained,84
NA,"from doing so earlier because I felt, i n justice",84
NA,to any woman I should not add further respon-,84
NA,"sibilities, either from a health or financial",84
NA,"point of view, unti l the doctors told me i t was",84
NA,safe to marry.,84
NA,The writer was suffering from tuber-,84
NA,culosis. The letter continues-,84
NA,For taking the commonsense point of view,84
NA,I am now ineligible for any assistance for my,84
NA,wife.,84
NA,My action thus prevented the spreading of,84
NA,"infection, and also saved the Government",84
NA,financial liability for a wife for all those years,84
NA,from 1919 to my marriage i n 1941.,84
NA,I t seems hard that privileges should be,84
NA,"granted to those men who, often very un-",84
NA,"wisely married quite early i n their T.B. life,",84
NA,"and that penalties be imposed on those who,",84
NA,"in the wisdom of their doctors, felt their health",84
NA,prevented them from taking on the responsi-,84
NA,bilities of a married life earlier than they did.,84
NA,Returned men feel that this section of the,84
NA,"Act sliould be amended by deleting that section,",84
NA,"after which date, 30th June, 1938, a man",84
NA,may not receive help for his wife i f he marries.,84
NA,I shall give this letter to the Minis-,84
NA,"ter, but I do not know whether he",84
NA,"has power to do anything about it, The",84
NA,"writer was suffering from tuberculosis,",84
NA,which was at an infectious stage. He was,84
NA,"a. man of some standing, and his doctor",84
NA,advised him tbat i f he married he would,84
NA,be doing a disservice to the community.,84
NA,"He would be likely to infect his wife, and",84
NA,if there were children they might be,84
NA,infected too. His doctor advised him,84
NA,not to marry until he was given a,84
NA,clean bill of health. He could have,84
NA,refused to accept his doctor's advice. He,84
NA,"could have married, and possibly spread",84
NA,"the infection, thereby imposing, upon tbe",84
NA,Government additional liabilities. How-,84
NA,"ever, he refrained from marrying until he",84
NA,was given a clean bill of health. He is,84
NA,"now married, and complains that, because",84
NA,"he faced his responsibilities as a citizen,",84
NA,he has been penalized. That is an,84
NA,anomaly which ought to be corrected. The,84
NA,Minister should be given discretionary,84
NA,"power to, deal with cases of the kind.",84
NA,"There cannot be many of them, and no",84
NA,great demand would be made on the,84
NA,Treasury by giving favorable considera-,84
NA,tion to applications of ex-servicemen in,84
NA,such a position. I appreciate the fact that,84
NA,the aet was amended to cover cases in,84
NA,which women married ex-servicemen for,84
NA,the sole purpose of deriving benefits,84
NA,under the act. I am not quarreling,84
NA,with the general provision. The prin-,84
NA,"ciple of the amendment was sound, but",84
NA,the anomalies created by it have become,84
NA,apparent only since the provision has been,84
NA,"in operation, and something should be",84
NA,done to correct those anomalies. I make,84
NA,no apology for my general remarks on,84
NA,"war pensions. I believe that, compared",84
NA,"with other persons in the community,",84
NA,the position of ex-servicemen is worse,84
NA,than i t used to be. The Minister should,84
NA,have pressed for increased rates in order,84
NA,to maintain the same relation between war,84
NA,pensions and the basic wage as obtained,84
NA,"in 1939. Because he failed to do so, he",84
NA,has fallen down on bis job.,84
Mr BARNARD ,Bass-Ministe r for,84
NA,Repatriation) [9.25] - I congratulate the,84
NA,honorable member for Wentworth ( Mr.,84
NA,Harrison) on the temperate way in which,84
NA,he stated his case. Such behaviour is,84
NA,"most unusual for him. On this occasion,",84
NA,he tiptoed through the tulips because he,84
NA,knew very well that there would be little,84
NA,justification for his remarks i f he were,84
NA,carrying the responsibility that now rests,84
NA,upon me as Minister. He kept very,84
NA,carefully away from one aspect of,84
NA,repatriation that has been Qf special,84
NA,interest to him in recent years. He,84
NA,"mentioned it in only a casual way, because",85
NA,he does not wish to have much to say,85
NA,about it. seeing that the election is so,85
NA,close. I refer to the question of the onus,85
NA,of proof in cases that come up for,85
NA,hearing before the War Pensions,85
NA,Entitlement Appeal Tribunal. I re-,85
NA,mind the honorable member for,85
NA,Wentworth tbat he was one of those,85
NA,who voted against the proposal to place,85
NA,the onus of proof on the Repatriation,85
NA,"Commission, the 'State repatriation",85
NA,"boards, and on the entitlement tribunal.",85
NA,tLe poserf as the champion of ex-service-,85
NA,"men, but when the Labour party, which",85
NA,"was then in opposition, wished to place",85
NA,the onus of proof upon the various bodies,85
NA,that deal with applications for war pen-,85
NA,"sions, he vofced against the proposal.",85
Mr HARRISON ,An d we subsequently,85
NA,put that piovision in the act.,85
Mr BARNARD ,"Yes , but with what",85
NA,reluctance! The honorable member for,85
NA,Bendigo ( Mr Rankin) was one of tbose,85
NA,"who voted for the proposal, 'but the",85
NA,honorable member for Richmond ( Mr.,85
NA,Anthony) voted with the honorable mem-,85
NA,ber for Wentworth against it. I can read,85
NA,the division list to the honorable mem-,85
NA,ber if he wants me to. The Labour Go-,85
NA,vernment has put tbe amending provision,85
NA,"into operation with great pleasure, so tbat",85
NA,"hundreds of men, who had been denied",85
NA,pensions when the honorable member for,85
NA,"Wentworth was Minister for Repatriation,",85
NA,have received tbem since I have been,85
NA,"Minister. However, I do not propose to",85
NA,"pursue that point further, nor to place on",85
NA,record once more the relevant division,85
NA,list. That was done as recently as June,85
NA,last. The honorable meinber for Went-,85
NA,"worth put his case very temperately,",85
NA,but some of his statements need to,85
NA,be appropriately replied to.,85
NA,he said that the Australian Soldiers',85
NA,Repatriation Act should be com-,85
NA,"pletely overhauled, and that it had",85
NA,not been overhauled since its introduction,85
NA,by the right honorable member for North,85
NA,Sydney ( Mr Hughes). The honorable,85
NA,"member knows that that is untrue, be-",85
NA,cause an almost completely new act was,85
NA,"introduced by my predecessor, Mr Frost,",85
NA,who then represented Franklin.,85
Mr HARRISON ,Practicall y no altera-,85
NA,tions were made.,85
Mr BARNARD ,I t was almost a,85
NA,completely new act.,85
Mr HARRISON ,I t was not.,85
Mr BARNARD ,I f the honorable,85
NA,"member reads it, be will find i t almost",85
NA,a completely new act. Between-1920 and,85
NA,"1943, so many anomalies came to light",85
NA,that it was decided to redraft the legis-,85
NA,lation in order to remove them. All the,85
NA,amendments of the principal act were,85
NA,consolidated as recently as 1943. So the,85
NA,honorable member draws a very long bow,85
NA,when he talks about the need for a com-,85
NA,plete overhaul of the act. I remind him,85
NA,that the amendments that were made in,85
NA,the 1943 act were based on the report and,85
NA,recommendations of a committee com-,85
NA,posed of returned soldiers from all sec-,85
NA,tions of the Parliament. The committee,85
NA,"was presided over by my honorable friend,",85
NA,the Minister for Commerce and Agricul-,85
NA,NA,85
NA,provided for an increase of pensions by,85
NA,20 per cent. The honorable member went,85
NA,on to talk about a 33-point plan.,85
NA,"Actually, the plan presented to the",85
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Chifley) and,85
NA,myself is a 36-point plan. A good,85
NA,deal of time has been spent on examining,85
NA,the document. I presume that the honor-,85
NA,able gentleman wanted to reduce it to a,85
NA,"33-point plan, because several of the",85
NA,requests made in i t were adopted and,85
NA,passed into law about 12 months ago.,85
NA,I do not propose to take up the,85
NA,time of the committee in enumerat-,85
NA,"ing them, but half a dozen sections of the",85
NA,plan have already been given legislative,85
NA,force in compliance with a request made,85
NA,by ex-service organizations at least a,85
NA,year ago. So much for the plan. We are,85
NA,still examining other proposals which it,85
NA,Eirst. contains. We hope to be able to reach,85
NA,a decision on some of the other re-,85
NA,quests contained in it as soon as the,85
NA,"Cabinet, is able to have a look at it.",85
NA,The honorable gentleman went on to say,85
NA,that returned soldiers' pensions had been,85
NA,kept static. For the benefit of honorable,85
NA,"members, I am getting out a document",85
NA,that gives a complete picture of pensions.,85
Mr ANTHONY ,Wil l i t have the,85
NA,Minister's photograph on it?,85
Mr BARNARD ,"No , I am not so",85
NA,proud of my photograph as all that.,85
NA,There may be photographs of some re-,86
NA,patriation institutions that we are proud,86
NA,"of. Between 1914 and 1916, when soldiers",86
NA,"were paid 6s. a day, the rate of pension",86
NA,was £2 a week. I t was not until the 6th,86
NA,"May, 1943, that the rate was increased to",86
NA,£2 10s. The honorable member criticizes,86
NA,the Government for not having done,86
NA,"anything for ex-servicemen. I n effect, he",86
NA,has said that since 1939 we have not done,86
NA,this or ought to have done that. But he,86
NA,"ignores the fact that, between 1914 and",86
NA,"1943, the pension of returned soldiers",86
NA,was not increased. I could quote the,86
NA,ngures to show the increase granted by,86
NA,this Government. A good deal has been,86
NA,"said about the 100 per cent, pension, that",86
NA,is the pension paid to an ex-serviceman,86
NA,whose disability is assessed at 100 per,86
NA,"cent, incapacity. Whereas he formerly",86
NA,"received a pension of £2, he now re-",86
NA,"ceives £2 15s. a week, and he can earn",86
NA,whatever pay he is able to earn. I n other,86
NA,"words, there is no means test.",86
Mr HARRISON ,Surel y a person in,86
NA,"receipt of a 100 per cent, pension could",86
NA,not earn anything.,86
Mr BARNARD ,"T h e 100 por cent,",86
NA,man should not be confused with the,86
NA,ex-serviceman who receives a special,86
NA,pension.,86
Mr THOMPSON ,"Th e "" T . P . I . "" ? .",86
Mr BARNARD ,"Yes , and the",86
NA,"' "" T.T.I."". The totally and permanently",86
NA,incapacitated and totally temporarily,86
NA,incapacitated men are in an entirely,86
NA,"different category from the 100 per cent,",86
NA,"men. The man on the 100 per cent, pen-",86
NA,sion may earn whatever he is physically or,86
NA,mentally capable of earning without,86
NA,interference to his pension. He is not,86
NA,subjected to the means test. The honor-,86
NA,able member for Wentworth makes the,86
NA,astounding claim that ex-servicemen,86
NA,"who work in industry, and have",86
NA,had the benent of increases of the,86
NA,"basic wage, should have their pen-",86
NA,sions fixed at a higher rate to accord,86
NA,with the increase of the cost of living.,86
NA,The pension has no relation whatever to,86
NA,the basic wage. Ex-service organiza-,86
NA,"tions-a t least, the Returned Sailors.",86
NA,Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of,86
NA,"Australia, wbich is the parent organiza-",86
NA,tion and which has looked after the,86
NA,welfare of ex-servicemen ever since World,86
NA,War I -hav e always argued against the,86
NA,adjustment of pensions on a sliding scale,86
NA,in accordance with rises or falls of the,86
NA,basic wage.,86
Mr HUGHES ,Explai n why!,86
Mr BARNARD ,Th e reason is that,86
NA,they do not desire the basic wage and the,86
NA,pension to be related as far as increases,86
NA,or decreases of the cost of living are con-,86
NA,cerned. They are prepared to rely on the,86
NA,generosity or lack of generosity of the,86
NA,Government in determining tbe rate of the,86
NA,pension. We have never applied falls,86
NA,or rises of the cost of living to any,86
NA,"ex-service pensioner, from the "" 100 per",86
NA,"cent-er"" to the ""10 per cent-er"". The",86
NA,increase of the pension was decided on,86
NA,"by the Government, that is the Labour",86
NA,"Government, because no other govern-",86
NA,ment gave an increase at all. Non-,86
NA,Labour governments applied the means,86
NA,"test to war widows. Until 1943, a widow",86
NA,who had a little property and let a couple,86
NA,of rooms to supplement her pension by a,86
NA,"small amount, received the handsome pen-",86
NA,sion of £1 3s. 6d. a week. The means,86
NA,test was always applied to widows until,86
NA,Labour came to the treasury bench in,86
NA,1941.,86
Mr THOMPSON ,Th e Minister is talk-,86
NA,ing about the widows of soldiers?,86
Mr BARNARD ,Yes . Ordinary,86
NA,widows did not receive a pension at all,86
NA,until we took office. We entirely re-,86
NA,moved the means test from war widows.,86
NA,No means test is applied to tbe 100 per,86
NA,"cent, pensioner who, without suffering a",86
NA,"reduction of his pension, may earn what-",86
NA,ever his physical or mental condition,86
NA,allows him to earn. I n earning that,86
NA,"money, he reaps the benefit of in-",86
NA,creases of the basic wage in accordance,86
NA,with the increase of the cost of living.,86
Mr WHITE ,Tb e means test is still,86
NA,applied to the parents of deceased soldiers.,86
Mr BARNARD , I shall come to that,86
NA,in a moment. I t seems fallacious tbat,86
NA,the pension should be increased because,86
NA,tbe basic wage has been increased.,86
Mr HARRISON ,Wh y did the Govern-,86
NA,ment not maintain the pension that,86
NA,operated in 1939?,86
Mr BARNARD , The honorable,86
NA,gentleman should ask himself that ques-,86
NA,tion. Why did his Government not.,86
NA,apply it?,86
Mr HARRISON ,W e did.,87
Mr BARNARD ,Returne d soldiers,87
NA,did not receive an increase of tlieir pen-,87
NA,sion until we gave it to them.,87
Mr WHITE ,The y were better off in,87
NA,1934.,87
Mr BARNARD, A lot of people,87
NA,"say, "" Take us back to the good old days",87
NA,but I notice that every one has more,87
NA,money in bis pocket to-ilay than he had,87
NA,then.,87
Mr WHITE ,Th e golden age?,87
Mr BARNARD ,W e have got nearer,87
NA,the golden age.,87
Mr HUGHES ,Th e pension is like a,87
NA,wage; i t is worth only what it will pur-,87
NA,chase.,87
Mr BARNARD ,I t is a pity tbat,87
NA,honorable members opposite cannot make,87
NA,up their minds. The right honorable,87
NA,member for North Sydney ( Mr Hughes),87
NA,argues along one line and tbe honorable,87
NA,member for Wentworth along another,87
NA,line.,87
Mr HARRISON ,W e are arguing along,87
NA,the same line.,87
Mr BARNARD ,Th e arguments run,87
NA,counter to each other. The honorable,87
NA,member for Wentworth said that the,87
NA,pension should be regarded as compen-,87
NA,sation.,87
Mr HARRISON ,Tha t is right.,87
Mr BARNARD , The honorable,87
NA,member agrees. Tbe right bonorable,87
NA,member for North Sydney said tbat tbe,87
NA,pension should increase according to tbe,87
NA,basic wage.,87
Mr HARRISON ,H e did not.,87
Mr BARNARD ,Honorabl e gentle-,87
NA,men opposite have never been able to,87
NA,make un their minds to agree on anything.,87
Mr HARRISON ,Ca n the Minister not,87
NA,understand that we use the basic wage,87
NA,as an illustration?,87
Mr BARNARD , Tbe honorable,87
NA,member for Wentworth describes the,87
NA,pension as compensation for services,87
NA,rendered. He talked about pensions,87
NA,being revised periodically. Pension rates,87
NA,were revised in 1943 and they have been,87
NA,revised at least twice since I have been,87
NA,Minister. Increases of pensions during,87
NA,my term of office have meant that an,87
NA,"additional amount of £2,000,000 is now",87
NA,circulating among ex-servicemen.,87
Mr WHITE, -Th e increases have been,87
NA,offset by the increase of the cost of living.,87
Mr BARNARD ,Tha t applies to,87
NA,everybody. Surely tbe honorable mem-,87
NA,ber would not argue that a man who is,87
NA,in receipt of the basic wage and who re-,87
NA,"ceives a 100 per cent, war pension, should",87
NA,""", have it both ways. As far as special",87
NA,rate pensioners are concerned I agree that,87
NA,there is some validity in the argument,87
NA,that a man who is in receipt of a pen-,87
NA,sion of £5 6s. a week for himself and,87
NA,"£1 4s. a week for his wife, and who has",87
NA,"to pay rent, must be having a struggle",87
NA,to live.,87
Mr WHITE ,Ag e pensioners can earn,87
NA,more.,87
Mr BARNARD , I agree with that.,87
NA,Some of these special rate pensioners,87
NA,"earn some proportion of the basic wage,",87
NA,but what about the man who gets £3,87
NA,or £4 a week from a superannuation,87
NA,fund? That amount is not taken into,87
NA,account because it is not produced by,87
NA,personal exertion. Wliat about the man,87
NA,who is a director of a firm and who has,87
NA,an income that is not produced by per-,87
NA,sonal exertion? We cannot measure all,87
NA,cases by the same yardstick. I f,87
NA,a concession is given to one person it,87
NA,must be given all down the line.,87
Mr HARRISON ,Th e Minister insists,87
NA,upon calling it a pension. I t is really a.,87
NA,compensation.,87
NA,Mr 'BARNARD -I t is described in,87
NA,the relevant act as a pension.,87
NA,Everybody refers to it as a pen-,87
NA,sion and it has been referred to,87
NA,by that name rigbt down through the,87
NA,years. The honorable member has raised,87
NA,an objection to the term used only be-,87
NA,cause he wants to be critical about tbis,87
NA,whole subject. I t is not of much use for,87
NA,the honorable member to shake his head,87
NA,"about it, because that will not alter the",87
NA,position. The honorable gentleman,87
NA,referred to the special case of a tuber-,87
NA,culous ex-serviceman. I deal with special,87
NA,cases every day. Special cases are,87
NA,always with us. The yardstick used in,87
NA,respect of other cases is not suitable,87
NA,for tubercular cases. Only recently the,87
NA,president of the Tubercular Sailors and,87
NA,Soldiers Association came to me and,87
NA,offered me his congratulations upon what,87
NA,the Government had done in the re-,88
NA,adjustment of pension rates for tuber-,88
NA,culous ex-servicemen. The honorable,88
NA,gentleman mentioned a case of a man who,88
NA,"married after a certain date, but he anti-",88
NA,cipated my answer because that was a,88
NA,matter that was decided long before a,88
NA,Labour government came into office.,88
NA,When returned servicemen's organiza-,88
NA,tions made a recommendation to this Go-,88
NA,vernment regarding what they considered,88
NA,should be provided in tbe new act of 1943,88
NA,they did not recommend the abolition,88
NA,of that particular section. They recom-,88
NA,mended that the maximum period in,88
NA,respect of soldiers from World War I .,88
NA,should be twenty years and tbat for,88
NA,soldiers of World War II . i t should be,88
NA,fifteen years. Tbat recommendation was,88
NA,"made by returned soldiers, some of whom",88
NA,are still members of this Parliament.,88
NA,The Government accepted the recom-,88
NA,mendation and that provision remains in,88
NA,the act.,88
NA,Let us return for a moment to the,88
NA,question of totally and permanently in-,88
NA,capacitated ex-servicemen. I t is true,88
NA,tbat a totally and permanently incapaci-,88
NA,tated ex-serviceman with no children,88
NA,must be finding it hard to live on his rate,88
NA,of pension. But that is not all we do for,88
NA,him. We have a very excellent system,88
NA,of education for the children of such,88
NA,people. As soon as a child living at home,88
NA,starts to go to school he is enabled to get,88
NA,"tram fares, books and so on until he",88
NA,reaches the age of thirteen years. The rate,88
NA,of educational allowance paid in respect,88
NA,"of a child was formerly 6s. a week, but",88
NA,it has been increased by this Government,88
NA,to 9s. a week for children between the,88
NA,ages of thirteen and fourteen. We also,88
NA,provide school hooks and sporting,88
NA,requisites for such children.,88
NA,educational allowance in respect of,88
NA,children between the ages of four-,88
NA,teen and sixteen is 12s. a week and,88
NA,"at sixteen years of age, when the pension",88
NA,"ceases to bc payable, educational assistance",88
NA,goes up to 33s. a week i f tbe child is living,88
NA,"at home, and 50s. a week i f living away",88
NA,from home. While children are at school,88
NA,we pay for books and provide sporting,88
NA,requisites. We even make an allowance to,88
NA,them i f tbey go to a university. The,88
NA,allowance for a boy learning a trade is,88
NA,45s. a week in bis first year of appren-,88
NA,"ticeship, and for a girl it is 40s. a week.",88
NA,"I f the young people are living, away from",88
NA,home the rates are 60s. and 55s.,88
NA,respectively. The pension rate is not,88
NA,a maximum rate but it is a minimum,88
NA,"rate, in effect, because of additional bene-",88
NA,fits available. Tbe Government regards,88
NA,itself as not being ungenerous .to,88
NA,ex-servicemen. I agree that some sections,88
NA,of exHservicemen have some d&fficuPty,88
NA,"in making ends meet, but I hope that a",88
NA,little later on we shall be able to review,88
NA,the matter and make spme provision,88
NA,for those who find themselves in great,88
NA,difficulty because of rising prices. As far,88
NA,as the 36-poi.nt plan of the Returned,88
NA,Servicemen's League is concerned I hope,88
NA,that we shall be able to do something more,88
NA,about that matter in the very near future.,88
NA,The Government has a record of achieve-,88
NA,ment ef service to ex-servicemen since,88
NA,it has been in office of which it can be,88
NA,justly proud.,88
Mr WHITE ,Member s of the Govern-,88
NA,ment would be the only ones who would,88
NA,be proud of it.,88
Mr BARNARD ,Th e honorable,88
NA,"gentleman may say tbat, but returned",88
NA,"servicemen, especially those who have had",88
NA,some responsibility as officials of,88
NA,"ex-servicemen's organizations, would tell",88
NA,the bonorable member that they approve,88
NA,of what the Government has done for them,88
NA,in removing anomalies in the act and in,88
NA,"providing more generous pensions, allow-",88
NA,"ances, educational benefits and medical",88
NA,attention. I think that in many cases,88
NA,ex-servicemen recognize that while they,88
NA,"may desire to have more, the Government",88
NA,lias not been ungenerous to them.,88
NA,Last week we heard some criticism of,88
NA,repatriation hospitals and of the Heidel-,88
NA,berg Military Hospital in particular.,88
NA,The Some general reference was made to,88
NA,repatriation hospitals by the honorable,88
NA,member for Henty ( Mr Gullett). The,88
NA,honorable gentleman is usually fairly,88
NA,generous in his comments on those,88
NA,matters. I f he desires to level criticisms,88
NA,at repatriation hospitals I consider that,88
NA,be should cite specific instances. Almost,88
NA,"daily I receive letters of commendation,",88
NA,not only from people high up in the,88
NA,social world who visit repatriation hos-,88
NA,"pitals, but also from people lower down in",88
NA,the social scale. They commend tbe Go-,88
NA,vernment for the services rendered by the,88
NA,staffs of repatriation hospitals. I con-,89
NA,fess that in a big institution where there,89
NA,"are perhaps 1,600 patients and a very",89
NA,"big staff, there may be from time to time",89
NA,some matters that require tightening up.,89
NA,I f such cases were brought to the notice,89
NA,of the department i t would have an oppor-,89
NA,tunity to deal with them. I say in con-,89
NA,clusion that as far as repatriation hos-,89
NA,pitals are concerned the Government has,89
NA,"real grounds for pride, and so have the",89
NA,returned soldiers.,89
Mr DEDMAN ,Corio-Ministe r for,89
NA,Defence and Minister for Post-war Eeoon-,89
NA,struction) [9.56] -Th e group of Esti-,89
NA,mates that we are debating covers the,89
NA,expenditure that is to be incurred by,89
NA,this Goverment for benefits of ex-service-,89
NA,men. I wish to examine what this Govern-,89
NA,"ment is doing, and to compare it with",89
NA,what a previous non-Labour Government,89
NA,did after World War I . I shall also com-,89
NA,pare the measure of prosperity now being,89
NA,enjoyed by ex-servicemen -with tbeir,89
NA,plight four years after World War 1.,89
NA,ended. The total expenditure incurred by,89
NA,the Commonwealth on all forms of bene-,89
NA,"fits to ex-servicemen of World War II . ,",89
NA,"up to the present time, amounts to",89
NA,"£88,000,000. That amount is accounted",89
NA,for under various headings. Eirst of all,89
NA,the Commonwealth reconstruction train-,89
NA,ing scheme provides university-type train-,89
NA,ing covering many thousands of,89
NA,ex-servicemen wbo take professional,89
NA,"courses to become doctors, dentists, scien-",89
NA,"tists, engineers and so on, and has involved",89
NA,"an expenditure, up to the 31st July",89
NA,"last, of approximately £11,000,000. That",89
NA,"amount includes almost £7,000,000 for",89
NA,"living allowances and £1,600,000 for",89
NA,"tuition fees. [Quorum, formed.""] The",89
NA,"amount also includes more than £1,000,000",89
NA,for additional courses and more than,89
NA,"£1,000,000 for accommodation and equip-",89
NA,ment. An amount has been provided for,89
NA,technical and vocational-type training,89
NA,under the Commonwealth reconstruction,89
NA,training scheme wbich includes training,89
NA,for all types of trades. A sum total of,89
NA,"£24,000,000 has been expended on that",89
NA,activity up to the 31st July last. That sum,89
NA,"included £8,000,000 for living allowances,",89
NA,"£5,000,000 for tuition fees, and more than",89
NA,"£9,000,000 for subsidies to employers. As",89
NA,honorable members know bow this scheme,89
NA,"is operated, I shall not go into details",89
NA,with regard to it. It is a magnificent,89
NA,scheme for the rehabilitation and re-,89
NA,"establishment of ex-servicemen, and it",89
NA,far excels any scheme that was put into,89
NA,operation by anti-Labour governments,89
NA,after World War I. In connexion with,89
NA,rural type training an amount of,89
NA,"approximately £1,000,000 has already",89
NA,been expended. There are certain liabili-,89
NA,ties in relation to pensions but as that,89
NA,matter has been dealt with by the Minis-,89
NA,"ter for Eepatriation ( Mr Barnard), I",89
NA,shall not deal with it now. On the sup-,89
NA,plementation of apprentices' wages an,89
NA,"amount of £3,500,000 has been expended.",89
NA,Grants bave also been made of,89
NA,furniture loans. Small business loans,89
NA,and agricultural loans of less than,89
NA,£250 have accounted for approxi-,89
NA,"mately £5,000,000. There are many",89
NA,other items such as medical treat-,89
NA,"ment for war-caused disabilities, free",89
NA,"passages to and from the Commonwealth,",89
NA,re-employment allowances and removal,89
NA,"expenses, on which heavy expenditure",89
NA,has been incurred. A total of,89
NA,"£88,000,000 has been expended on the",89
NA,rehabilitation and re-establishment of ex-,89
NA,servicemen. The Labour Government,89
NA,"realized, in drawing up all these plans for",89
NA,re-establishment and rehabilitation,89
NA,"of ex-servicemen, tbat they could be",89
NA,implemented only if the community as,89
NA,"a whole was prosperous. Consequently,",89
NA,the whole plan was envisaged in an,89
NA,economy enjoying full employment. It,89
NA,can be truthfully said that there are no,89
NA,ex-servicemen in the community who,89
NA,have not already been re-established or,89
NA,rehabilitated or who are not now in the,89
NA,course of being successfully re-established,89
NA,or rehabilitated. I ask honorable,89
NA,members to contrast that position,89
NA,with the position tbat existed four years,89
NA,after the termination of World War I.,89
NA,I have taken the trouble to examine the,89
NA,Estimates for 1921-22 in order to make,89
NA,such a comparison. [Quorum formed.],89
Mr WHITE ,A s two Ministers are,89
NA,endeavouring to take up the remainder,89

NA,torian Premier to urge the Victorian,90
NA,Government to co-operate in pro-,90
NA,viding as much work as possible,90
NA,for unemployed ex-servicemen. The,90
NA,deputation also tried to see the Prime,90
NA,"Minister, Mr Hughes, but was unable to",90
NA,do so. The Lord Mayor informed the,90
NA,"Premier that between 1,100 and 1,200",90
NA,returned men with families were on the,90
NA,verge of starvation.,90

NA,There are indications of a revolt among,90

NA,by the Bepatriation Department. The soldiers,90
NA,at Tooles Creek Settlement have called an,90
NA,urgent meeting to deal with the proposal,90
NA,. . . The lien is similar to that served upon,90

NA,I n the Sydney Morning Herald of the,90

NA,appeared:-,90
NA,A conference of Mayors was convened by the,90
NA,Lord Mayor to consider measures for providing,90
NA,employment for returned soldiers. The Lord,90
NA,Mayor said the League and associations in-,90
NA,terested in returned soldiers had agreed to form,90
NA,a confederacy. The idea was that there should,90
NA,be only one central organization dealing with,90
NA,unemployed soldiers.,90

Mr DEDMAN ,"O h the 27th May,",91
NA,"1922, this report appeared in the Sydney",91
NA,Morning Herald-,91
NA,A deputation of soldier settlers on dairying,91
NA,lands in the Bellingen shire waited on the,91

NA,ment appeared-,91
NA,Mr Thomas Buckland presided at the hall,91
NA,yearly meeting at the Bank of New South,91
NA,Wales yesterday. Two facts too evident to,91
NA,ignore he said were that industries were,91
NA,languishing and unemployment abounded.,91
NA,"On the 15th June, 1922, i t was reported-",91
NA,Dissatisfaction is expressed by officials of,91
NA,the Eeturned Soldiers League at the poor,91
NA,response to appeals for employment.,91
NA,"On the 27th June, 1922, the following",91
NA,statement appeared in the Sydney,91
NA,Morning Herald-,91
NA,The serious aspect of the industrial situation,91
NA,in Newcastle has been increased by the closing,91
NA,down of the works of Bylands Bro6. The,91
NA,works have been devoted mainly to the manu-,91
NA,facture of wire netting.,91
NA,We have heard a number of complaints,91
NA,from honorable gentlemen opposite that,91
NA,soldier settlers cannot get sumcient wire,91
NA,netting to meet their requirements. Tbe,91
NA,"reason is that, because of tbe pros-",91
NA,"perity of primary producers generally,",91
NA,there is sucb a great demand for wire,91
NA,netting now that supplies are insufficient.,91
NA,That is in marked contrast with,91
NA,tbe situation i n 1922 wben farmers,91
NA,had not suflicient money to buy,91
NA,enough wire netting to keep the wire,91
NA,netting works in production. Tbe present,91
NA,situation is entirely different from that,91
NA,which existed in 1922. I have given,91
NA,tbe committee a description of tbe plight,91
NA,of returned servicemen in 1922. When,91
NA,the federal president of the Returned,91
NA,Servicemen's League visited me in,91
NA,Canberra not very long ago he said that,91
NA,he had not one criticism to make of what,91
NA,the Department of Post-war Reconstruc-,91
NA,tion was doing for returned servicemen.,91
NA,The only matters that he had to raise,91
NA,in relation to the welfare of returned,91
NA,servicemen were matters that were taken,91
NA,up with the Minister for Repatriation,91
NA,( Mr Barnard). I t can be said that this,91
NA,Government has looked after the interests,91
NA,of the returned servicemen of this country,91
NA,on this occasion very much better than,91
NA,they were looked after by anti-Labour,91
NA,governments after World War I .,91
Mr HAMILTON ,D o not some of the,91
NA,reconstruction trainees complain about,91
NA,for a revalutheir living allowances?,91
Mr DEDMAN ,Som e trainees have-,91
NA,"complained about their living allowances,,",91
NA,-but the vast majority of them know that,91
NA,they are being very generously treated.,91
NA,I repeat for tbe information of the-,91
NA,honorable member for Swan ( Mr-,91
NA,Hamilton) that the amount that has been,91
NA,expended upon living allowances for uni-,91
NA,"versity trainees is £7,000,000. Approxi-",91
NA,"mately £8,000,000' has been expended",91
NA,upon living allowances for trainees under-,91
NA,going technical and vocational training.,91
NA,I t is true that some trainees have com-,92
NA,"plained of the scale of the allowances,",92
NA,but the vast majority of them are,92
NA,satisfied that they are being treated very,92
NA,generously by the Government.,92
NA,I propose to make one or two remarks,92
NA,about land settlement. After World,92
NA,War I. land settlement was undertaken,92
NA,by the State governments. It was so,92
NA,badly managed that it cost the Common-,92
NA,"wealth approximately £30,000,000 to",92
NA,write off debts that were incurred. The,92
NA,main reason for that situation was that,92
NA,land was bought at prices that were far,92
NA,too high. Returned servicemen who were,92
NA,settled on the land after World War I.,92
NA,were left with a millstone of debt hanging,92
NA,round their necks. [Quorum formed?],92
Mr TURNBULL , I rise to order. Is,92
NA,there any special reason why the honor-,92
NA,able member for Hume ( Mr Fuller),92
NA,should rush from the chamber im-,92
NA,mediately a quorum is called?,92
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN , -,92
NA,Order! Tbere is no point of order,92
NA,involved.,92
Mr DEDMAN ,"Afte r World War I . ,",92
NA,many returned servicemen spent many,92
NA,years of their lives in trying to make a,92
NA,success of the properties that ha'd been,92
NA,allotted to them under the war service,92
NA,land settlement schemes of that time.,92
NA,They incurred huge debts. Eventually,92
NA,they found tbat it was quite impossible,92
NA,"to make a living, and they had to leave",92
NA,their blocks and start life afresh. After,92
NA,"a period of years, debts to the value of",92
NA,"over £30,000,000 were written off by the",92
NA,Commonwealth. On this occasion we have,92
NA,taken steps to ensure that returned,92
NA,servicemen who go on the land will get,92
NA,a fair deal. We bave also taken steps,92
NA,to ensure tbat tbe valuations of tbeir,92
NA,properties will be sucb as to enable tbem,92
NA,"to earn a reasonable personal income,",92
NA,to pay all their expenses and eventually,92
NA,to make a great success of the blocks on,92
NA,which they have been established.,92
Mr TURNBULL ,Whe n will tbey know,92
NA,what they bave to pay?,92
Mr DEDMAN ,Tha t is a matter for,92
NA,discussion between the State governments,92
NA,and the Commonwealth. The Com-,92
NA,monwealth bas arrived at an agreement,92
NA,"with Western Australia, South Aus-",92
NA,tralia and Tasmania in relation to,92
NA,valuations. The same remark applies,92
NA,to Queensland. The New South,92
NA,Wales Government has indicated that,92
NA,it does not wish to fix the valua-,92
NA,tions for another five years. Victoria,92
NA,is the only State with wliich I have had,92
NA,any difficulty in relation to land valua-,92
NA,tions.,92
NA,I shall give to the committee some,92
NA,details of the war service land settle-,92
NA,ment scheme. Up to the 30th June this,92
NA,"year, the proposals submitted by State",92
NA,governments related to an area of,92
NA,"9,235,000 acres. The area approved by",92
NA,the Commonwealtb as suitable for war,92
NA,"service land settlement was over 7,000,000",92
NA,acres. Tbe number of properties,92
NA,"approved for acquisition was over 1,000,",92
NA,"involving an area of almost 7,000,000",92
NA,acres. Tbe number of properties,92
NA,acquired by State governments for war,92
NA,"service land settlement was S37, cover-",92
NA,"ing an area of 6,000,000 acres. The",92
NA,number of properties approved for sub-,92
NA,"division was 551, covering 3,000,000",92
NA,acres. The number of single farm units,92
NA,"approved by the Commonwealth, tbe",92
NA,great majority of which are in New,92
NA,"South Wales, was 468, covering an area",92
NA,"of 3,000,000 acres.",92
Mr TURNBULL ,Th e Minister was,92
NA,opposed to single farm units.,92
Mr DEDMAN ,Tha t is not true.,92
NA,The honorable member for Wimmera,92
NA,( Mr Turnbull) does not know what he is,92
NA,talking about. I have always been pre-,92
NA,pared to accept single farm propositions,92
NA,provided they are submitted to me within,92
NA,the terms of the War Service Land Settle-,92
NA,ment Agreements. I f the honorable,92
NA,gentleman knew anything about tbe,92
NA,agreements he would know that I bave no,92
NA,power to refuse to consider single farm,92
NA,unit propositions provided they are,92
NA,within tbe terms of the agreements. I,92
NA,did object to considering propositions,92
NA,tbat were not put forward within the,92
NA,terms of the agreements. I refused to,92
NA,have anything to do with propositions bf,92
NA,that kind. None of them has been,92
NA,accepted by me. That is not because,92
NA,"of my objection to them, but because they",92
NA,did not come within the terms of tbe,92
NA,relevant legislation. Some single farm,92
NA,propositions have been dealt with,92
NA,by tbe Victorian Government outside,93
NA,the War Service Land Settlement,93
NA,Agreement altogether. The fact that,93
NA,they are being dealt with by the,93
NA,Victorian Government does not mean,93
NA,that i f tbat Government bad put,93
NA,them up to me within the terms of its,93
NA,"agreement, I should not have accepted",93
NA,them. State governments are bound to,93
NA,comply with the terms of the agreements,93
NA,in the same way as I am bound to comply,93
NA,with them. The total sum of money,93
NA,that bas been expended upon war service,93
NA,land settlement to date is approximately,93
NA,"£16,000,000. Approximately one-half of",93
NA,that sum of money has been expended,93
NA,upon the acquisition and development of,93
NA,estates generally and upon rural train-,93
NA,ing for the settlers who will occupy the,93
NA,blocks. The remainder of the money has,93
NA,been expended unon re-establishment,93
NA,loans for returned servicemen who are,93
NA,"ou the land. That is' tbe £1,000 loan",93
NA,proposition. That is entirely a Com-,93
NA,monwealth scheme and the State govern-,93
NA,ments are not called upon to bear any,93
NA,of that expenditure. I express my,93
NA,gratitude to the State governments for,93
NA,making available to me facilities such as,93
NA,the Rural Bank of New Soutb Wales,93
NA,and the Soldier Settlement Commission,93
NA,in Victoria for the purpose of organiz-,93
NA,"ing in connexion witb the scheme,",93
NA,doing the necessary inspections of,93
NA,the properties and generally assist-,93
NA,ing the Commonwealth in allocating,93
NA,the money. Administrative expenses,93
NA,of that kind are borne by the Common-,93
NA,"wealth, but I express my thanks to the",93
NA,State governments for having made those,93
NA,facilities available to us. Soldier settlers,93
NA,and in fact all ex-servicemen of World,93
NA,War II . have heen given very generous,93
NA,treatment by this Government and there,93
NA,it not any section of the community which,93
NA,does not recognize that to be so.,93

Mr WHITE ,Balaclava) [10.32] -1,93
NA,direct attention to a matter affecting a,93
NA,former naval officer in the hope that the,93
NA,Minister for the Navy ( Mr Riordan),93
NA,will ensure that justice shall be done to,93
NA,him. I did not consider that this matter,93
NA,should be raised when the Estimate*,93
NA,for the Department of the Navy were,93
NA,"under consideration, even if I had been",93
NA,given an opportunity to speak on that occa-,93
NA,sion. I propose to relate the experience,93
NA,of a former Lieutenant-Commander in the,93
NA,Royal Australian Navy who was court-,93
NA,"martialled on five charges, found not",93
NA,guilty on the two most serious ones and,93
NA,reprimanded on the other three. As the,93
NA,result of that reprimand he has forfeited,93
NA,the whole of his deferred pay amounting,93
NA,to some hundreds of pounds. Although,93
NA,the naval regulations provide for for-,93
NA,"feiture in such circumstances, the punish-",93
NA,ment in this instance does not fit the,93
NA,crime. That is an unwritten law which,93
NA,is older than all the naval regulations,93
NA,and the regulations that have been pro-,93
NA,mulgated under the defence Act. I shall,93
NA,cite the details of the case. This man is,93
NA,the son of a retired bank manager,93
NA,and is himself a senior bank officer. Every,93
NA,"member of his family, including himself,",93
NA,had an excellent war record. He volun-,93
NA,teered and served in the Royal Australian,93
NA,"Navy on the lower deck, was promoted to",93
NA,"sub-lieutenant in fourteen months, to",93
NA,"lieutenant three months later, and to act-",93
NA,ing lieutenant-commander after a further,93
NA,four years. Whilst serving as an officer,93
NA,he carried out naval secretarial duties,93
NA,"ashore and afloat in Arunta, Shropshire",93
NA,"and Bataan. He joined Bataan in April,",94
NA,"1946, as secretary to the commanding",94
NA,"officer, who was in charge in the Tenth",94
NA,Destroyer Flotilla. His duties were of a,94
NA,secretarial nature and were concerned,94
NA,with the flotilla of six destroyers. He was,94
NA,officer in charge of public moneys on,94
NA,"Bataan, but he had nothing whatever to",94
NA,do with victualling. I shall describe what,94
NA,happened.,94
NA,"I n December, 1946, Bataan paid an",94
NA,official visit to Shanghai for four days.,94
NA,Upon arrival he drew local currency,94
NA,from the Australian legation. Prior,94
NA,"to sailing twelve days later, he returned",94
NA,the balance of unexpended Chinese,94
NA,currency. At this eleventh-hour visit tb,94
NA,"the legation on the day of sailing, he was",94
NA,confronted with three accounts for,94
NA,victualling stores presumed to have been,94
NA,purchased from Chinese providors during,94
NA,the stay of the vessel in Shanghai. He,94
NA,"was requested to sign them, because of the",94
NA,short time that would elapse before,94
NA,Bataan sailed. The supply petty officer in,94
NA,charge of victualling claimed that it,94
NA,would not be possible for him to return,94
NA,on board in order to obtain the signature,94
NA,of the requisite authority. He has written,94
NA,to me as follows:-,94
NA,These facts are hazy to me now and i t is,94
NA,possible I signed the three documents in the,94
NA,ship immediately before being asked to bring,94
NA,"the documents ashore to the legation office,",94
NA,fact of my visit being known to the supply,94
NA,petty officer. The difference in times of sign-,94
NA,ing would be only half or one hour. The,94
NA,supply - petty officer was a recommended and,94
NA,trusted rating and my banking experience,94
NA,would make me believe the woTd of a senior,94
NA,rating.,94
NA,Eventually the legation copies of the,94
NA,victualling accounts were received in the,94
NA,"Department of the Navy, and they dis-",94
NA,agreed with the amount of provisions that,94
NA,were actually taken on charge in the,94
NA,"ship's account. Earlier, the ship's account",94
NA,"was "" missing"" and when the supply",94
NA,petty officer was asked to make out a,94
NA,"duplicate copy, the account which he",94
NA,"handed in was the "" missing"" original.",94
NA,I understand that the supply petty officer,94
NA,was prosecuted on otber charges at a court,94
NA,"of inquiry, and it became evident to tbe",94
NA,former commander whose case I am,94
NA,voicing that a circumstantial case,94
NA,had been woven around bim. The,94
NA,senior rating was later discharged from,94
NA,the service and deprived of his good con-,94
NA,duct badges. The officer claims that he,94
NA,was the unfortunate victim of circum-,94
NA,stances. I do not know the facts of the,94
NA,matter other than as they have been given,94
NA,"to me, but I am informed that the cost",94
NA,of the trial of the officer amounted to,94
NA,"approximately £10,000. I think that this",94
NA,"officer, having spent many years of his",94
NA,"life in the service, should have received",94
NA,more sympathetic consideration from the,94
NA,Department of the Navy. I am not one,94
NA,of those who believe in breaking down,94
NA,"discipline, and I agree tbat a man who",94
NA,commits a crime must take his punish-,94
NA,"ment. However, the punishment should",94
NA,always fit the crime. The officer has,94
NA,written as follows:-,94
NA,"After the Sydney Board of Inquiry i n July,",94
NA,my previously approved demobilization was,94
NA,deferred. I was kept inactive i n Sydney until,94
NA,the end of August and then allowed to pro-,94
NA,ceed home to Melbourne. I n mid September,94
NA,I was flown to Japan to rejoin Bataan. One,94
NA,uf the two officers referred to above was,94
NA,trained to Melbourne from Cairns and accom-,94
NA,panied me to Japan. From here Bataan sailed,94
NA,to Shanghai where a second Board of Inquiry,94
NA,was held in a British cruiser which had come,94
NA,up from Hong Kong. The Chinese providors,94
NA,were witnesses.,94
NA,"From Shanghai, Bataan spent fourteen days",94
NA,in Hong Kong before returning to Japan.,94
NA,I n mid November I was informed I was to be,94
NA,court-martialled and so Bataan returned to,94
NA,Shanghai and Australia arrived from Hong,94
NA,such Kong. I was charged on two alternate charges,94
NA,of defrauding the Commonwealth Government,94
NA,and three charges of signing documents when,94
NA,I had no authority to do so. I was found,94
NA,not guilty of the two serious charges and as,94
NA,my signature was on the accounts my solicitor,94
NA,instructed me to admit the other three charges.,94
NA,T h e other three charges were l a i d under,94

NA,For several months at the end of 1!)47,94
NA,Bataan was almost entirely engaged i n this,94
NA,"case, going or coming from Shanghai. She",94
NA,"was sent thence, ostensibly on a courtesy visit,",94
NA,a request being sent to the Australian Minister,94
NA,in Nanking on both occasions for the visits,94
NA,to be approved by the Chipese Govern-,94
NA,ment. The following further expenses were,94
NA,incurred to bring nie to trial:-(1 ),94
NA,An officer travelled by train from Cairns,94
NA,to Melbourne and thence was flown to Japan.,95
NA,(2) I was flown to Japan. (3) A shorthand,95
NA,writer aud another officer were flown from,95
NA,Sydney to Japan to assist at the court-martial.,95
NA,(4) An officer was flown from Hong Kong,95
NA,to Japan to assist the prosecutor at the trial.,95
NA,(5) tlie prosecutor (the captain of Bataan),95
NA,took himself from Southern Japan to Yoko-,95
NA,hama to receive advice in conducting his,95
NA,case. (6) Fuel for consumption iu taking,95
NA,Bataan to Shanghai twice for inquiries. The,95
NA,"foregoing expenses amount to almost £10,000",95
NA,yet a request by me to have a retired naval,95
NA,officer flown ironi Sydney to Japan to assist me,95
NA,wns turned down unless I held myself,95
NA,responsible for his fare. Arriving in Shanghai,95
NA,3(1 hours before ray trial I had to go ashore,95
NA,"in a eity of almost 7,000,000 people and find",95
NA,a solicitor. There were four British solicitors,95
NA,in the city and I eventually obtained an,95
NA,U.N.B.B.A. man. After my trial he charged,95
NA,me £150. To comply with naval procedure I,95
NA,was offered one of tlie junior officers in,95
NA,Bataan.,95
NA,It should not be necessary for me to place,95
NA,any additional facts before tbe Minister,95
NA,"for the Navy. As I bave stated, I do",95
NA,"not know this man personally, other than",95
NA,through this case. After five,95
NA,service in tbe Royal Australian,95
NA,he attained the rank of acting,95
NA,commander. As an accountant,95
NA,signed certain documents and he realizes,95
NA,that be must accept the,95
NA,bility for the sins of another.,95
NA,documents that had been placed before,95
NA,him without being able to check them.,95
NA,As the result of the findings of the court-,95
NA,"martial, he bas forfeited between £500",95
NA,and £600 in deferred pay. Tbat,95
NA,is too harsh. This could not happen in,95
NA,the Army or in the Air Force.,95
NA,deferred pay of a soldier or an airman,95
NA,"would not be touched. It is contended,",95
NA,"I know, that deferred naval pay is good",95
NA,"conduct pay, but I am sure that no mem-",95
NA,ber of this Parliament would agree that,95
NA,a man who suffers a reprimand in any,95
NA,of the armed services should lose pay-,95
NA,ments that have accumulated during many,95
NA,"years of service. As I have said, I havo",95
NA,already taken this matter up with the,95
NA,Minister. I know that he is merely a,95
NA,cipher. He is the servant of the Naval,95
NA,Board. He sends matters such as this to,95
NA,"the Naval Board, and the board provides",95
NA,tbe answers. But this is a special case.,95
NA,The serious charges were not proved.,95
NA,am diffident about mentioning the matter,95
NA,"at all because I rather lean the other way,",95
NA,and believe that a man must take what is,95
NA,coming to him. I have sat on many,95
NA,ilfr. White.,95
NA,courts-martial i n the A r m y and i n the,95
NA,"A i r Force, but I believe that human con-",95
NA,siderations must be taken into account.,95
NA,I repeat that the punishment must fit the,95
NA,crime. That principle is older than any,95
NA,"military, air force, or naval law. I",95
NA,remind the Minister that there was a,95
NA,celebrated case i n England i n which a,95
NA,"midshipman, Archer Shee, was accused of",95
NA,a dishonest act while attending a naval,95
NA,college. He was expelled f r o m the Navy.,95
NA,"Sir Edward Carson, later Lord Carson,",95
NA,took up his case years afterwards. The,95
NA,incident was dramatized i n a recent very,95
NA,fine British film called The Winslow Boy.,95
NA,The film showed how that boy was dis-,95
NA,"graced, but, through the persistency of his",95
NA,father and other relatives and with tbe.,95
NA,"able advocacy of Sir Edward Carson, he",95
NA,"was finally cleared, although he never",95
NA,returned to the Navy. The demand,95
NA,made by Sir Edward Carson i n that case,95
NA,"was "" Let rigbt be done"". I t took a",95
NA,years' hide-bound Admiralty a long time to,95
NA,"Navy recognize the claim, but finally right",95
NA,lieutenant- was done. I ask the Vice-President of,95
NA,he the Executive Council ( Mr Scully) to,95
NA,take this matter up w i t h the Minister for,95
NA,"responsi- the Navy, who is absent f r o m tbe chamber",95
NA,He signed at present. I am not pleading f or the,95
NA,man. Probably I do not know him anv,95
NA,better than any other honorable members,95
NA,"do, but he bas come to me with his case,",95
NA,and I feel that the punishment imposed,95
NA,penalty upon h i m was harsh. The matter sbould,95
NA,be reviewed to ensure tbat right is done.,95

NA,to recover his stolen property?,97
Mr CHIFLEY ,Th e answers to the,97
NA,honorahle member's questions are as,97
NA,follows:- .,97
NA,1. Several letters have been received by me,97
NA,from Mr Rivers containing the information,97
NA,mentioned together with representations con-,97
NA,cerning his desire to obtain the return of the,97
NA,"vessel from Soumalaki, Dutch East Indies.",97
NA,2. Mr Bivers did not convey the informations,97
NA,to me concerning the refusal of the magistrate-,97
NA,"to issue a warrant but I have learned that such,",97
NA,was the case. The ruling was made (after the-,97
NA,"Crown Law authorities had proceeded against,",97
NA,"the two men concerned on a charge, to the",97
NA,"effect that on or about the ls t May, 1949, they",97
NA,"had stolen the vessel), for the reason that the-",97
NA,vessel had originally been delivered to the-,97
NA,accused by Mr Bivers under an agreement,97
NA,"dated the 4th August, 1948, i n which the-",97
NA,latter leased his vessel to those men for a,97
NA,"period expiring on the 30th April, 1949. The-",97
NA,magistrate ruled that there was insufficient,97
NA,evidence before him to establish larceny and,97
NA,adjourned the case sine die. The vessel was,97
NA,"not returned to the lessor on the date agreed',",97
NA,upon and i t was later located at Soumalaki in,97
NA,the Tanimbar Islands from whence i t was-,97
NA,towed to Ambon. To enable a prima facie-,97
NA,case to hc made out i t was necessary to put,97
NA,before the court evidence of-intent to steal by,97
NA,the accused.,97
NA,"3. No, but that, nevertheless, was the",97
NA,position.,97
NA,4. Yes.,97
NA,5 and G. After the date of my letter of the-,97
NA,"3rd June, 1949, to Mr Rivers, a report of the-",97
NA,hearing before the magistrate was received by,97
NA,"the Crown Law authorities, Canberra, from the",97
NA,"Crown Law Officer, Darwin, from which i t",97
NA,appeared that the purpose of the proposed visit,97
NA,at of the police was to interrogate the accused,97
NA,with the object of obtaining admissions from,97
NA,them of their guilt. As one of the accused,97
NA,had constantly maintained to the Netherlands,97
NA,authorities that he had bought the vessel from,97
NA,"Mr Bivers in August, 1948, i t was considered",97
NA,by the Crown Law authorities that no useful,97
NA,purpose would be served by making the visit.,97
NA,The Dutch autliorities have been informed that,97
NA,the Australian Government no longer desires,97
NA,to send police representatives to Batavia,97
NA,(where i t is understood the accused now are).,97

NA,companies are largely carried on i n countries,98
NA,"outside the sterling area, where some 85",98
NA,"per cent, of their total output is produced.",98
NA,The quantity of petrol sold by oil companies,98
NA,in the United Kingdom for export to other,98
NA,countries is negligible. According to tlie,98
NA,United Kingdom trade and navigation accounts,98
NA,"this amounted to only 5,692,000 gallons during",98

NA,stantial importer of petrol and other petroleum,98
NA,PETROL.,98
NA,"products and, like Australia, draws her sup-",98
NA,plies of these products from both British and,98
NA,American controlled companies. The nature,98
NA,and extent of the dollar cost of oil to the,98
NA,sterling area was also explained in thc fore-,98
NA,going documents. A t present the total net,98
NA,dollar cost is running at an annual rate well,98
NA,"over 400,000,000 dollars. As well as pur-",98

NA,1. A conference of senior officers of the,99
NA,Trade Promotion Section of my department,99
NA,was held in Melbourne recently to discuss,99
NA,ways and means of increasing exports to the,99
NA,American and other dollar markets including,99
NA,more extensive and continued contact with,99
NA,Australian producers of commodities both,99
NA,primary and secondary which may be marketed,99
NA,profitably for dollars or othet hard currencies.,99
NA,2. My department nas given the utmost,100
NA,assistance to manufacturers and exporters i n,100
NA,the marketing of some of the commodities,100
NA,mentioned and was largely instrumental i n,100
NA,initially ^establishing-the trade in lobster tails,100
NA,"ahd f r u i t juices. Difficulty has been, and is",100
NA,still being encountered i n the marketing of,100
NA,leather and leather goods i n dollar areas.,100
NA,Every opportunity is being taken to encourage,100
NA,the marketing of Australian products in hard,100
NA,currency countries however unimportant such,100
NA,trade may appear i n the first instance.,100
NA,"GUIDED "" WEAPO NS TESTING RANGE.",100
Mr FRANCIS , the M i n i s t e r f o r,100
NA,"I m m i g r a t i o n , u p o n notice-",100
NA,1. Has his attention heen drawn to allega-,100
NA,tions by a correspondent in a 'Sydney -weekly,100
NA,'newspaper that Maltese brought to Australia,100
NA,"for urgent Commonwealtli projects "" have been",100
NA,"insulted and pushed around"" at the rocket",100
NA,Tange?,100
NA,2. W i l l Ihe investigate these 'allegations .and,100
NA,"also 'inquire into -the complaints of these -men,",100
NA,"who claim .to be experienced carpenters, that",100
NA,they were rejected by a board on the range and,100
NA,advised to get work in a city f .,100
NA,3. In 'fairness to Aus'tralia and because of the,100
NA,"-splendid record of the Maltese during the war,",100
NA,-will he'take steps to-ensure that-these men aie,100
NA,not subjected to further hardships and .that,100
NA,there is a -proper examination of the qualifica-,100
NA,tions of such tradesmen'before they are sent to,100
NA,Australiaf,100
NA,"Mr OALWBLI , - T h e answers t o the",100
NA,honorable member's questions are as,100
NA,follows:-,100
NA,"1, 2 and 3. The press statement to which thc",100
NA,honorable member refers is based on a mis-,100
NA,understanding of the conditions under which,100
NA,.Maltese settlers were brought to Australia.,100
NA,The standards of skill -within the trades asso-,100
NA,ciated with .building in Australia have always,100
NA,"beon jealously guarded, not only in the interests",100
NA,"of the workers themselves, but also in the",100
NA,interests of the public generally. Since other,100
NA,countries 'use different ^techniques in building,100
NA,"and work largely i n different materials, i t",100
NA,follows that a skilled tradesman from another,100
NA,country does not necessarily immediately,100
NA,"measure up to Australian standards of skill,",100
NA,"iit ui realized, therefore, that i t is -unlikely",100
NA,to be possible to carry out trade teste abroad,100
NA,which will bc acceptable to a l l unions and,100
NA,"employers i n Australia. Nevertheless, i t is",100
NA,still necessary 'to guard against -men w i t h no,100
NA,-skill or experience posing as tradesmen in order,100
NA,"to be granted passages to this country, and -the",100
NA,"Maltese Government, in consultation with the",100
NA,"Commonwealth Government, instituted a system",100
NA,of trade testing of men who have applied for,100
NA,emigration from Malta as tradesmen. The,100
NA,'trade tests are conducted by the Maltese trade,100
NA,"-training authority and, while they do not",100
NA,.permit absolute deGnition of skill by Australian,100
NA,"standards, they do -serve as. a guide to the",100
NA,skill of applicants. AU the Maltese settlers,100
NA,employed at Woomera who were formerly,100
NA,employed us tradesmen i n .Malta were warned,100
NA,"..prior to embarkation for Australia, that irre-",100
NA,"spective of tlieir previous experience, their",100
NA,recognition as tradesmen here would depend,100
NA,upon their ability to establish the requisite,100
NA,degree of skill under Australian conditions.,100
NA,After their arrival at Woomera the men were,100
NA,given several months to settle down and were,100
NA,then trade tested by a board -consisting of a,100
NA,senior works supervisor of the Department of,100
NA,"Works and Housing, a union representative,",100
NA,and a leading hand carpenter. Only a pro-,100
NA,portion of the men so tested were successful,100
NA,in satisfying the board that their skill was up,100
NA,to Australian standards. Those who did not,100
NA,pass thc test .are-employed as unskilled workers,100
NA,"on tlie job, and were not advised to seek",100
NA,employment elsewhere. I n view of these cir-,100
NA,"cumstances, I do not feel that any further",100
NA,"investigation is necessary, for the situation",100
NA,in regard to employment of the Maltese settlers,100
NA,at Woomera is similar to that in Canberra and,100
NA,"elsewhere, and is well known not only to me",100
NA,and my officers but also to the Maltese Govern-,100
NA,ment. I may say that while the difficulties,100
NA,of -this situation have been known for some,100
NA,"'time, I have not been complacent concerning",100
NA,"them, and as a result of a suggestion made",100
NA,"by me, through my representative in Malta i n",100
NA,"May of this year, a technical expert from Malta",100
NA,asttt pnesent-on his way to -Australia to survey,100
NA,standards of Australian trade training in each,100

NA,-were purchased in full (spot or forward),101
NA,prior to the 19th September; otherwise,101
NA,payment at the higher rate would have to,101
NA,be made. Any importer in doubt on this,101
NA,-question should consult his 'banker.,101

NA,prior to devaluation. Importers when,101

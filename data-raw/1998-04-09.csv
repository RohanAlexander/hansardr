NA,resumed the chair at 8.30 a.m.,13
NA,BUSINESS,13
Mr REITH ,Flinders-Leader of the,13
NA,"House) (8.30 a.m.)- Mr Speaker, for the",13
NA,"information of members, we are awaiting the",13
NA,final delivery to all members of documenta-,13
NA,tion. It will take a couple of moments for that,13
NA,material to be made available.,13
NA,I might start by thanking those officers of,13
NA,the parliament and officers of the Attorney-,13
NA,General's Department and other relevant,13
NA,sections for the work they have been doing,13
NA,overnight. We have been through this situa-,13
NA,"tion before where, when the Senate sits very",13
NA,"late, there is then the very",13
NA,putting together the sum total of the con-,13
NA,siderations of the Senate so that the amend-,13
NA,ments and outcomes of the Senate process can,13
NA,be transmitted through to the House of Repre-,13
NA,sentatives.,13
NA,That also involves a very detailed examin-,13
NA,"ation of the outstanding issues, so it is there-",13
NA,fore important that the executive be fully,13
NA,briefed on the outcomes from the Senate. That,13
NA,has meant that a very large number of people,13
NA,"have had to work all through the night, for",13
NA,hour upon hour. I do not think the Senate,13
NA,completed its deliberations until around 2.30,13
NA,a.m. So we thank all those who have been,13
NA,responsible for completing that work.,13
NA,The course of action now proposed is that,13
NA,the House will consider these matters in,13
NA,committee. We propose to have two speakers,13
NA,"a side of 15 minutes and five minutes, so we",13
NA,hope the House will be able to adjourn for the,13
NA,Easter break in roughly 45 minutes. They are,13
NA,the administrative matters that have been,13
NA,concluded.,13
NA,The schedule of amendments made by the,13
NA,"Senate will cover validation, the right to",13
NA,"negotiate, the question of the Racial Discrimi-",13
NA,"nation Act, the proposals in respect of a",13
NA,"sunset clause, all of those being very signifi- Opp (RN42)",13
NA,"cant issues, and other significant issues which",13
NA,have been raised during the lengthy debate in,13
NA,the Senate. I thank members for their pa-,13
NA,tience.,13
NA,Mr Bradford-If I could take a point of,13
NA,"order, Mr Speaker, the Leader of the House",13
NA,announced arrangements that have been made,13
NA,for this debate. I am just not sure to what,13
NA,extent those arrangements include the minor,13
NA,parties and Independents. I realise those,13
NA,arrangements are not made with regard to our,13
NA,interests. I have a great interest in this matter,13
NA,and would hope to have the opportunity to,13
NA,"make at least a few brief remarks, not want-",13
NA,ing to hold people up from getting home to,13
NA,their families at Easter.,13
Mr SPEAKER,I can assure the honour-,13
NA,able member that the standing orders do not,13
NA,discriminate between any members of this,13
NA,"House, whatever the particular group of",13
NA,people with whom they might be sitting at,13
NA,significant task of anyone time.,13

NA,The bill as returned to us by the Senate is,35
NA,quite unacceptable to the government. The bill,35
NA,that was passed through this parliament last,35
NA,"year, and again a few weeks ago, was a fair",35
NA,and balanced piece of legislation. It already,35
NA,represented a major compromise. It represent-,35
NA,ed a fair balancing of the interests of all,35
NA,sections of the Australian community. It was,35
NA,fair as between Aborigines and farmers; it,35
NA,was fair as between city and country; it was,35
NA,fair as between Australian and Australian.,35
NA,The bill as amended by the Senate will not,35
NA,treat farmers and Aborigines equally. The bill,35
NA,as amended by the Senate gives special,35
NA,privileges to one group of Australians denied,35
NA,to others. It contains provisions which are not,35
NA,available to other sections of the Australian,35
NA,community and are specifically available to,35
NA,"one group of Australians, and that group of",35
NA,(137); Australians alone. It is a fundamental of our,35
NA,"kind of society, and it is certainly a funda-",35
NA,"mental of the approach of my government,",35
NA,that all Australians should be treated equally,35
NA,before the law. All Australians should be,35
NA,"entitled to an equal dispensation of justice,",35
NA,and all Australians should have equal respon-,35
NA,sibilities before the law.,35
NA,There are four major objections which the,35
NA,government has to the bill as amended by the,35
NA,Senate. They surround the areas that have,35
NA,been debated at length over the past weeks,35
NA,"and the past months. They relate, firstly, to",36
NA,"the right to negotiate, secondly, to the regis-",36
NA,"tration test, thirdly, to the application",36
NA,Racial Discrimination Act to this piece of,36
NA,"legislation and, fourthly, to the so-called",36
NA,sunset clause.,36
NA,We have long argued that it is wrong in,36
NA,principle that there should be a right to,36
NA,negotiate over pastoralleaseholdings subject,36
NA,to mining applications in the hands of in-,36
NA,"digenous claimants, yet that right is not",36
NA,available to farmers and pastoralists. We do,36
NA,not believe that that right should be available,36
NA,to one group and not available to others.,36
NA,That is the fundamental reason why we,36
NA,have always said that a bill which contained,36
NA,the right to negotiate was always going to be,36
NA,"unacceptable, not only to the rural community",36
NA,"of the Australia, not only to the mining",36
NA,"industry of Australia, but indeed to the vast",36
NA,"bulk of the Australian community, who",36
NA,"believe in a very sacred principle, that is,",36
NA,equality of all Australians before the law.,36
NA,"Mr Speaker, I would remind the parliament",36
NA,that when the original native title legislation,36
NA,was passed at the behest of the Keating,36
NA,government in 1993 it was never intended,36
NA,that the right to negotiate should apply to,36
NA,pastoral leaseholdings. Nothing which has,36
NA,"happened in all the hours, all the weeks and",36
NA,all the months of the debate that has gone on,36
NA,since the High Court brought down its deci-,36
NA,sion in the Wik case in December 1996 has,36
NA,disturbed that unassailable historical fact,36
NA,the original legislation was predicated on the,36
NA,basis that the grant of a pastoral leasehold,36
NA,extinguished native title.,36
NA,That was contained in a preamble to the,36
NA,"1993 act. It was asserted by Mr Keating, my",36
NA,predecessor as Prime Minister. That assur-,36
NA,"ance, that assumption, that statement, that",36
NA,declaration of belief was contained in corres-,36
NA,pondence which passed between the then,36
NA,Prime Minister and some premiers of the,36
NA,Australian states. It was the belief and the,36
NA,assumption under which the former Labor,36
NA,"Premier of Queensland, Wayne Goss, operat-",36
NA,"ed. It was always believed, even by prominent",36
NA,"members of the indigenous community, that",36
NA,the idea that native title should have survived,36
NA,the grant of a valid pastoral lease was com-,36
NA,pletely unacceptable. The whole basis of all,36
NA,of our understanding was that that was an,36
NA,of the unassailable fact.,36
NA,Then to our very great surprise the High,36
NA,Court of Australia decided in December 1996,36
NA,that that was not necessarily so. There were,36
NA,many people then with a great deal of justifi-,36
NA,"cation, including many of the farmers of",36
NA,Australia and all of the state premiers of,36
NA,Australia-and I say advisedly: all of the state,36
NA,premiers of Australia-including the Premier,36
NA,"of New South Wales, Mr Bob Carr, who said",36
NA,that the proper response of the government in,36
NA,the wake of the High Court decision was in,36
NA,fact to pass a law that simply confirmed the,36
NA,"understanding of the parliament and, the",36
NA,understanding of the Australian people in,36
NA,December of 1993 that the grant of a valid,36
NA,pastoral lease extinguished native title.,36
NA,That was the pressure under which my,36
NA,"government was placed, and that was the",36
NA,the view of many of my colleagues who now sit,36
NA,"behind me, not only in the National Party, but",36
NA,"also in the Liberal Party, because they believe",36
NA,that is what the Australian people had been,36
NA,"promised, guaranteed and led to believe by",36
NA,the former Labor Prime Minister.,36
NA,"But, because of our respect for the decision",36
NA,taken by the High Court and because of our,36
NA,belief that we had to properly balance the,36
NA,"interests of farmers and Aborigines, we said,",36
NA,"'No, we will not embrace that course of",36
NA,"action, but what we will seek to do is estab-",36
NA,that lish a legislative structure-which was ulti-,36
NA,mately embodied in the lO-point plan and,36
NA,subsequently in the Native Title Amendment,36
NA,Bill-that would enshrine the principles of,36
NA,"equality of treatment, respect the principles of",36
NA,"native title laid down in the Mabo case,",36
NA,confirm the interpretation of that in relation,36
NA,to pastoral leaseholdings enunciated in the,36
NA,"Wik decision, and present it to the people as",36
NA,a fair and decent compromise.,36
NA,If anybody has any doubts about the veraci-,36
NA,"ty of that proposition, go and talk to the rural",36
NA,representatives in the western lands division,36
NA,"of New South Wales, who argued very",36
NA,strongly that their particular leaseholds were,36
NA,exclusive tenures of the type contemplated by,36
NA,the Wik decision and therefore should have,36
NA,totally extinguished native. But because our,36
NA,"legal advice was that that was not so, we",37
NA,refused to include those particular,37
NA,leaseholdings in the schedule to the Native,37
NA,Title Amendment Act. In the face of the,37
NA,fiercest criticism-and understandable criti-,37
NA,cism from those people-the government said,37
NA,"no, it would not compromise the integrity of",37
NA,the legislative framework that it had estab-,37
NA,lished.,37
NA,"I mention these things, Mr Speaker, because",37
NA,it is important in perhaps the very final,37
NA,speech I will make in this parliament in,37
NA,relation to this piece of legislation that the,37
NA,Australian public ought to be reminded of the,37
NA,original expectation given voice by Paul,37
NA,Keating as Labor Prime Minister of Australia,37
NA,that the grant of a valid pastoral lease extinwas,37
NA,guished native title-an assumption under,37
NA,which all Australians were entitled to operate;,37
NA,a bona fide belief held by all Australians; a,37
NA,High Court decision that overturned that,37
NA,exception; a refusal by my government to,37
NA,simply embrace the extinguishment option in,37
NA,relation to those pastoral leaseholdings; and,37
NA,the hammering out of a compromise that was,37
NA,"honourable to everybody, bitterly disappoint-",37
NA,ing many of my own party supporters and,37
NA,having to say face to face to many representa-,37
NA,"tives of the rural community of Australia,",37
NA,"'We are prepared to go so far, but no further.'",37
NA,"In the interests of fairness, balance and",37
NA,justice the Deputy Prime Minister ( Mr Tim,37
NA,Fischer) and I were prepared to say to many,37
NA,people and many organisations that have been,37
NA,"lifelong supporters of our two parties that,",37
NA,"the interests of fairness and balance, we could",37
NA,not go any further than the lO-point plan.,37
NA,I mention those things as a measure of the,37
NA,bona fides of my government and the bona,37
NA,"fides of the Deputy Prime Minister, who, I",37
NA,"might say, has displayed conspicuous courage,",37
NA,tenacity and decency on this particular issue.,37
NA,In this speech I want to thank the Deputy,37
NA,Prime Minister again for the contribution he,37
NA,has made in very difficult circumstances.,37
NA,I say to the farmers of Australia: although,37
NA,we could not do everything that you would,37
NA,"want us to do, there is one thing we have",37
NA,"been able to do-that is, we have clung",37
NA,tenaciously to the principle that all Austral-,37
NA,ians should be treated equally; we have clung,37
NA,tenaciously to the principle that farmers and,37
NA,Aborigines should be treated equally; we have,37
NA,clung tenaciously to the principle that no one,37
NA,group in the Australian community should,37
NA,have rights that are not enjoyed by another,37
NA,group. That is why we were never prepared,37
NA,to compromise on the issue of the right to,37
NA,negotiate.,37
NA,We have said to the farmers of Australia:,37
NA,we are not going to legislate to implement,37
NA,your legitimate expectation raised by the,37
NA,Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating; not only,37
NA,are we going to fail to give force to your,37
NA,legitimate expectation but we are going to go,37
NA,"further, we are going to leave the right to",37
NA,negotiate over pastoral leaseholds although it,37
NA,only ever intended that it would apply to,37
NA,vacant crown land. That would have been to,37
NA,doubly throw dirt in the face of the rural,37
NA,"community of Australia. We were simply, in",37
NA,"the interests of fairness and balance, unpre-",37
NA,pared to do that.,37
NA,It has always been a cardinal principle of,37
NA,"our handling of this legislation that, once the",37
NA,"Wik decision was brought down, the right to",37
NA,negotiate over pastoral leaseholds had to go,37
NA,as a matter of ordinary commonsense and,37
NA,logic because the original basis of the legisla-,37
NA,tion was that you could only make a native,37
NA,"title claim over vacant crown land, and that",37
NA,was the belief enshrined in the recital of the,37
NA,"original act. It defies logic, fairness, common-",37
NA,sense and balance in the Australian communi-,37
NA,ty that that right to negotiate should continue,37
NA,in to apply in relation to pastoral leases. The,37
NA,failure of the Senate to accept that principle,37
NA,means that the amendment on that issue alone,37
NA,is absolutely unacceptable to my government.,37
NA,"The other issues, although of lesser signifi-",37
NA,"cance, are nonetheless very significant in",37
NA,themselves. I thought at one stage that we had,37
NA,"amended the original registration test, but I",37
NA,found last night that we had not because there,37
NA,was a double backflip with triple pike done,37
NA,by the minor parties in the Senate. The,37
NA,registration test in its present form-the,37
NA,Senate form-is unacceptable.,37
NA,And of course there is the application of the,37
NA,racial discrimination clause. This is the clause,37
NA,that the Labor Party in government decided,37
NA,not to apply. This is the clause that Father,37
NA,"Frank Brennan, in that now notorious corres-",38
NA,"pondence in the Sydney Morning Herald, said",38
NA,was being used by the Labor Party as a,38
NA,device to get an early election on this issue.,38
NA,If you leave the bill in the form proposed by,38
NA,"the Senate, you will end up applying the",38
NA,principle of double jeopardy in relation to,38
NA,every piece of litigation that might take place,38
NA,under the Native Title Act. That of course is,38
NA,also unacceptable.,38
Mr TUCKEY ,A lawyers' clause.,38
Mr HOWARD,It would be a lawyers',38
NA,feast. I am indebted to the honourable mem-,38
NA,"ber for O'Connor for that interjection. Finally,",38
NA,"of the four things I wish to mention, there is",38
NA,"the sunset clause, which is a simple proposi-",38
NA,tion. If you are a registered claimant after a,38
NA,"period of six years, you really cannot go any",38
NA,further. It does not take away the common-,38
NA,law right to bring an action in the Federal,38
NA,Court; it is merely limited in relation to.,38
NA,registered claimants. It is a totally fair and,38
NA,"reasonable principle, but that is also regarded",38
NA,as unacceptable by the Senate.,38
NA,"In relation to the Senate, the Senate has",38
NA,been guilty of some quite bizarre behaviour,38
NA,on this. I talk in particular of the Senate's,38
NA,gyrations and chopping and changing on the,38
NA,issue of the registration test and the sunset,38
NA,clause. We did at one stage have a decent,38
NA,registration test but that disappeared in the,38
NA,dead of night last night. We did at one stage,38
NA,have a sunset clause which was reasonable,38
NA,and fair but that also disappeared. Not only,38
NA,did the Senate deny us what we wanted in,38
NA,"relation to the right to negotiate, what Labor",38
NA,said was fair---':and Father Frank Brennan,38
NA,continues to say is fair-in relation to the,38
NA,"Racial Discrimination Act, but at· the 11 th",38
NA,"hour, at five minutes to midnight, so to speak,",38
NA,they have also denied the House of Represen-,38
NA,tatives what was wanted in relation to the,38
NA,registration test and the sunset clause.,38
NA,There are numerous other amendments,38
NA,listed on the grey sheet that have been insert-,38
NA,ed by the Senate which we find completely,38
NA,unacceptable. There are just two other things,38
NA,that I want to say very carefully to the parliadivisive,38
NA,ment and to the Australian people. I reject,38
NA,completely the description constantly used by,38
NA,"many in the media that, if the Wik bill is the",38
NA,"subject of a double dissolution, the next",38
NA,election will be a race election. There will be,38
NA,no race election as far as my government is,38
NA,concerned. We will never embrace the politics,38
NA,of race. We will never seek to exploit a,38
NA,political issue or create a political argument,38
NA,based on race. We do not have in our ranks,38
NA,people who have used racist language. We do,38
NA,not have in our numbers people who have,38
NA,used racist language. I notice that I am going,38
NA,to be followed by somebody who has still,38
NA,failed to apologise for having made some very,38
NA,crude and some very crass remarks.,38
NA,It will not be a race election so far as my,38
NA,party is concerned. It will not be a race,38
NA,election so far as the Leader of the National,38
NA,Party is concerned. If those media commenta-,38
NA,tors who continue to loosely and glibly,38
NA,describe it as such had any concern for the,38
NA,"harmony of the Australian community, they",38
NA,would stop using such a ridiculous title.,38
NA,"I believe that this bill, after it has been",38
NA,"disposed of, should be laid aside, but there",38
NA,will be some further amendments to be dealt,38
NA,with shortly. In its form as presented by the,38
NA,"Senate, for the reasons that I have outlined",38
NA,"and in circumstances that I greatly regret, the",38
NA,bill is absolutely unacceptable to the govern-,38
NA,ment. (Time expired),38
Mr GARETH EVANS ,Holt-Deputy,38
NA,Leader of the Opposition) (8.50 a.m.)-It is,38
NA,deeply depressing that the government has,38
NA,chosen to reject the Native Title Amendment,38
NA,Bill 1997 [No.2] in the form in which it is,38
NA,returned to us from the Senate. There is no,38
NA,reason in law or justice or economics or,38
NA,morality for this bill in this form to be reject-,38
NA,"ed. If it is rejected, it will not be for any",38
NA,reason of law or economics or justice or,38
NA,morality. It· will be for reasons of politics-,38
NA,the politics of the coalition and the accommo-,38
NA,"dation of the National Party within it, the",38
NA,politics of the forthcoming Queensland elec-,38
NA,tion and the politics of winning the federal,38
NA,election in rural and regional Australi.a.,38
NA,This is a divisive and confrontational,38
NA,government which has deliberately taken a,38
NA,and confrontational course on issue,38
NA,after issue since it has been in office. It has,38
NA,taken that course now on the Australian,38
NA,waterfront and it has taken it now here on an,38
NA,issue that is even more explosive-the issue,39
NA,of race and Aboriginal rights. The tragedy is,39
NA,that it has been so unnecessary for the,39
NA,government to take this course.,39
NA,We in the opposition approached this whole,39
NA,issue from the outset in a conciliatory and,39
NA,consensual fashion. We kept trying to find,39
NA,solutions throughout the course of this debate,39
NA,that would be acceptable to all the key stake-,39
NA,"holders-indigenous Australians, pastoralists,",39
NA,miners and the larger Australian community.,39
NA,We have been constantly disappointed by the,39
NA,government's reaction and we are disappoint-,39
NA,ed again-disappointed to the extent of total,39
NA,depression-by the government's reaction,39
NA,today.,39
NA,Let me proceed immediately to the sub-,39
NA,stance of the issues and explain why it is that,39
NA,the government should be prepared to accept,39
NA,this bill in the form in which it has come,39
NA,back to us. The government says there are,39
NA,four key issues in the legislative package,39
NA,which make that impossible. That is not a,39
NA,view that is accepted by the opposition and,39
NA,"let me explain why. First of all, the threshold",39
NA,or registration test. This is the key to a great,39
NA,deal else in the bill. It is crucial that it be,39
NA,effective. It is crucial that we end so-called,39
NA,paper claims once and for all. It is crucial that,39
NA,the right to negotiate in future be exercised,39
NA,only by claimants to native title with a rea-,39
NA,sonable chance of success.,39
NA,The amendment passed by the Senate is not,39
NA,precisely what the government wanted in this,39
NA,"respect, that is true, but it does get that result.",39
NA,It is a very different set of provisions from,39
NA,that which passed the Senate in December.,39
NA,What we now have-and let me identify it-,39
NA,is first of all a set of tough procedural hurdles,39
NA,that have to be jumped. We have a criterion,39
NA,whereby each individual claim has to be,39
NA,prima facie sustainable and determined as,39
NA,such by the registrar. We have to have a,39
NA,"traditional physical connection, not just any",39
NA,"old connection, or, in the absence of that, a",39
NA,lockout. That is going back only one genera-,39
NA,tion: the issue has not been put in the legisla-,39
NA,tion of going back more than one generation.,39
NA,"Alternatively, if you have not got that kind",39
NA,"of traditional association or a lockout, you at",39
NA,the very least have to have an acknowledged,39
NA,traditional law assocIatlOn or a customary,39
NA,association which has been maintained with,39
NA,this particular patch of land to the extent,39
NA,practicable-the Mabo test outlined by Mr,39
NA,"Justice Brennan. That is not some loose,",39
NA,"vague, spiritual association test, as has been",39
NA,constantly claimed; it is a workable and,39
NA,defensible addition to the legitimate bases for,39
NA,such a claim being made.,39
NA,There is moreover something the govern-,39
NA,ment was always reluctant to accept-God,39
NA,knows why because it adds very significantly,39
NA,to the armoury of the miners who want to,39
NA,contest rights to negotiate being triggered in,39
NA,situations where they think the claims being,39
NA,made are indefensible. There is provision in,39
NA,our threshold test for a collateral challenge to,39
NA,be made to the registrar's decision in circum-,39
NA,stances where it is beyond the registrar's,39
NA,"power to determine a contested matter of fact,",39
NA,but it is a matter of the court's power. We,39
NA,have now put in a provision expressly enab-,39
NA,"ling an unsustainable claim, in effect, to be",39
NA,swept away at the threshold. So much for the,39
NA,threshold test.,39
NA,"As to the right to negotiate, yes,as tlie bill",39
NA,comes to us from the Senate that has been,39
NA,retained for mining on pastoral leases-the,39
NA,"issue that was left open, not foreclosed, in",39
NA,1993. Why shouldn't that right to negotiate be,39
NA,retained? What we are talking about here is,39
NA,a common law right to have native title or a,39
NA,claim of such common law right which the,39
NA,government recognises legitimately does,39
NA,trigger a right to negotiate in relation to,39
NA,mining and compulsory acquisition exercises,39
NA,if it is on vacant crown land. What difference,39
NA,should it make that a pastoral lease has been,39
NA,given over that crown land? We are not,39
NA,talking about freehold and we are not talking,39
NA,about full commercial leasehold of the kind,39
NA,which involves exclusive possession; we are,39
NA,"talking about pastoral leases, which, as we all",39
NA,"know or should know, historically were no",39
NA,more than essentially grass and water licences,39
NA,to graze. That is the truth of the matter.,39
NA,The onus is not on those who want to argue,39
NA,for a right to negotiate to be extended to,39
NA,pastoral leases; the onus must be on those,39
NA,who would want to take away the right to,39
NA,negotiate from those with credible common,39
NA,law claims to native title who would have that,40
NA,right if it were vacant crown land and for,40
NA,whom the existence of a pastoral lease should,40
NA,make no difference. Pastoralists are not being,40
NA,prejudiced in any way. Their rights will not,40
NA,be one iota diminished from what they are,40
NA,under statute or common law at the moment.,40
NA,The final point to make about the right to,40
NA,negotiate is that it is critical not only to the,40
NA,justice and morality of this package but also,40
NA,to its legal certainty. The Hindmarsh Island,40
NA,case left very much open the necessity for a,40
NA,race based constitutional provision to operate,40
NA,to the net benefit of Aboriginal or indigenous,40
NA,people and it is clear that the right to negoti-,40
NA,ate will be crucial in any determination of,40
NA,that net benefit.,40
NA,"As to the third issue of the sunset clause,",40
NA,is true that has now been deleted from the,40
NA,"legislation, but this has always been the least",40
NA,"credible, least plausible, of the government's",40
NA,"positions and, frankly, acknowledged as such",40
NA,"in many private conversations, which I will",40
NA,not be rude or crude enough to actually,40
NA,"identify, going right back to the beginning of",40
NA,this debate. The truth of the matter is that it,40
NA,has always been acknowledged that the sunset,40
NA,clause would not inhibit the pursuit of com-,40
NA,mon law claims-and that has been acknow-,40
NA,ledged again by the Prime Minister ( Mr,40
NA,Howard) today; all it would do is rub out the,40
NA,statutory procedures being applicable. All the,40
NA,existence of a sunset clause would have done,40
NA,is trigger an avalanche of ambit claims which,40
NA,would make much more difficult the practical,40
NA,resolution of these vexed and sensitive issues.,40
NA,"As to the final of the four issues, the Racial",40
NA,"Discrimination Act clause, this is not the kind",40
NA,of destructive weapon the government claims,40
NA,it to be. We did amend the text of the bill to,40
NA,make specific provision to exclude from any,40
NA,possible override by the Racial Discrimination,40
NA,Act its application to not only the original,40
NA,validations but also the validations that have,40
NA,been accomplished for the intermediate period,40
NA,from 1994 to 1996. There has been in addi-,40
NA,tion an interpretive footnote inserted in our,40
NA,amendment designed to make it clear that the,40
NA,RDA applies in relation to the performance of,40
NA,"functions, the exercise of powers or the",40
NA,resolution of ambiguity.,40
NA,"In other words, there is a very clear direc-",40
NA,tion being given to the courts that it is not the,40
NA,intention of the legislature that the Racial,40
NA,Dis-rimination Act cut some sort of destruc-,40
NA,tive swath through the substantive provisions,40
NA,of the legislation. It is there as an interpretive,40
NA,guide and it is there as a restatement of the,40
NA,"fundamental principle, which we all ought to",40
NA,"be prepared to accept, that non-discrimination",40
NA,ought to apply and ought to be visibly seen to,40
NA,apply.,40
NA,It is critical to appreciate that these four,40
NA,issues are not the only issues that have been,40
NA,the subject of the Senate debate. A huge,40
NA,number of other issues have been debated and,40
NA,overwhelmingly in relation to all these other,40
NA,issues the government got what it wanted. Let,40
NA,it me list what the government has achieved in,40
NA,this respect so people can understand why it,40
NA,is.we say that the government should not be,40
NA,rejecting this legislation in the form in which,40
NA,it has come back and for it to do so is politi-,40
NA,"cally driven rather than driven by economics,",40
NA,"law, morality or justice. Let me list these",40
NA,issues quickly.,40
NA,"On the validation issue, the government got",40
NA,what it wanted with ALP support. On the,40
NA,"issue of confirmation of past extinguishment,",40
NA,the government got everything it wanted with,40
NA,a couple of comparatively small exceptions.,40
NA,On the question of indigenous land use,40
NA,"agreements, largely as a result of a consensus",40
NA,in negotiation we have achieved something,40
NA,that is supported by both the government and,40
NA,"the opposition parties, a better outcome than",40
NA,December and one that in particular will,40
NA,allow for the resolution of a great many of,40
NA,those tangles of outstanding claims from the,40
NA,pre-1996 period which will not be revisited,40
NA,under the new threshold test and which have,40
NA,to be somehow addressed if we are to resolve,40
NA,"the continuing problem areas, particularly in",40
NA,the Goldfields and elsewhere.,40
NA,"On the primary production regime, t-e gov-",40
NA,ernment's pastoral diversification regime was,40
NA,"here accepted, effectively in its entirety. The",40
NA,government and the pastoralists have every-,40
NA,"thing in practice they could reasonably want,",40
NA,and did in fact want. Non-claimant applica-,40
NA,"tions, water and air space issues were clear",40
NA,wins for the government in the sense that it,40
NA,got exactly what it wanted; it got its bill. On,41
NA,"the renewals issue, the government got nearly",41
NA,"all that it wanted, with one huge advance on",41
NA,"December, which was given to it with ALP",41
NA,"support, and that was the renewal of mining",41
NA,leases and interests on the same terms as they,41
NA,had previously existed. That will not now,41
NA,trigger a right to negotiate. It was a matter,41
NA,which the mining industry had very strong,41
NA,feelings-a matter on which we sought and,41
NA,achieved a consensus outcome.,41
NA,"On the issue of reservations, the govern-",41
NA,ment got what it wanted. On the question of,41
NA,"services to the public, there was a mixed",41
NA,outcome for the government. It got everything,41
NA,except the right to construct new facilities,41
NA,without a compulsory acquisition right to,41
NA,negotiate regime being associated with that.,41
NA,"On low impact acts, there· was achieved in the",41
NA,Senate an extension to low impact explor-,41
NA,"ation-that is, that does not now trigger a",41
NA,right to negotiate. That is a major advance for,41
NA,the mining industry and for the government,41
NA,"on what was achieved in December, and it",41
NA,was delivered with complete cross-party,41
NA,support as a result of negotiations. On the,41
NA,"freehold test and offshore issues, the govern-",41
NA,ment got exactly what it wanted. On statutory,41
NA,"access rights, the government got half of what",41
NA,it wanted. It maintained what we would,41
NA,regard as the unfair element of suspending,41
NA,common law native title rights when statutory,41
NA,"access is in fact achieved, granted or exer-",41
NA,"cised, but the opposition won its position on",41
NA,the extension of those access rights to cover,41
NA,various lock-out situations.,41
NA,"On compensation, we achieved an improved",41
NA,regime-delivered by agreement-and one,41
NA,thing that will make the bill a lot more certain,41
NA,in its legal application so far as this area is,41
NA,concerned. On the question of applications,41
NA,"procedure, the government got what it want-",41
NA,"ed. On claims procedure, it got what it want-",41
NA,"ed. On the question of representative bodies,",41
NA,"it got what it wanted, with some significant",41
NA,improvements on the 1993 bill incorporating,41
NA,some positions negotiated by the government,41
NA,with the opposition. On a whole miscellany,41
NA,"of other issues, which it is not easy to simply",41
NA,"characterise, the government got 14 of its",41
NA,"amendments up; we got seven, including,",41
NA,"might I say, an amendment to guarantee the",41
NA,Queensland Chevron pipeline deal which was,41
NA,delivered last night-a statutory provision to,41
NA,"that effect-by the opposition, the Greens,",41
NA,Senator Harradine and the Democrats against,41
NA,government opposition. That is there in the,41
NA,text of the legislation and that will not be,41
NA,on forgotten in the forthcoming Queensland,41
NA,debate.,41
NA,"The point is this: I have just rattled through,",41
NA,together with the original four matters I dealt,41
NA,"with at more length, .the 20 key issue areas",41
NA,that were up for debate in the Senate. On 14,41
NA,"of those 20 key issues, the government got",41
NA,exactly or more or less exactly what it want-,41
NA,"ed. On two other of those 20 issues, the",41
NA,outcome was divided from a government,41
NA,perspective. On four of those issues-the,41
NA,"RDA, the sunset clause, the threshold test and",41
NA,the right to negotiate; the big four that the,41
NA,government keeps emphasising-it did not get,41
NA,what it wanted. But I should say that over-,41
NA,whelmingly the balance is there and any,41
NA,reasonable analysis of the outcome in the,41
NA,Senate will make it absolutely clear that this,41
NA,is a package that should have been accepted,41
NA,by the government. I should say that even this,41
NA,outcome has been even more divisive and,41
NA,confrontational than could have been the case.,41
NA,More options were on the table that could,41
NA,have delivered consensual negotiated out-,41
NA,comes on issues which still remain divisive as,41
NA,"between us, including, I have to say, the right",41
NA,to negotiate itself.,41
NA,The debate lost its way when the govern-,41
NA,"ment, as I understand it, backed away from",41
NA,various undertakings or assurances or under-,41
NA,standings that were given in negotiations with,41
NA,Senator Harradine. That led him to walk back,41
NA,from positions that he previously had taken.,41
NA,There is no point in going over the agony of,41
NA,"all that debate over the last two weeks, but all",41
NA,"I can say in general terms is that, had the",41
NA,"political atmospherics been a lot better, had",41
NA,this government been not so obviously deter-,41
NA,mined to create the conditions for confronta-,41
NA,"tion here, a totally acceptable outcome could",41
NA,have been achieved; and that is of course,41
NA,something we have been arguing for from day,41
NA,one-that it is possible with goodwill to,41
NA,achieve that.,41
NA,What we have as a consequence of the,42
NA,failure to reach a complete agreement on all,42
NA,these issues is a number of residual areas of,42
NA,quite serious legal uncertainty so far as this,42
NA,bill is concerned. Because of the govern-,42
NA,ment's achieving its way on a number of the,42
NA,"issues that I have already mentioned, there is",42
NA,a very real question as to whether this legisla-,42
NA,tion can in its present form satisfy the benefi-,42
NA,cial requirement which we believe continues,42
NA,to exist in section 51(xxvi) and which will be,42
NA,determined by the High Court when it finally,42
NA,gets around to addressing the substantive,42
NA,issues on things like confirmation of extin-,42
NA,guishment to the extent that it does not apply,42
NA,"common law rules. There are some just terms,",42
NA,issues which again are redolent right through,42
NA,"this legislation, which had I the time I would",42
NA,address.,42
NA,But let me just come back to where I remaining,42
NA,"started. Nothing in the economics, the",42
NA,the justice or the morality should stop this,42
NA,being accepted. The· government will be,42
NA,judged by its failure to accept this bill. It,42
NA,"be judged, of course, by indigenous people from the Senate.",42
NA,"who, once again, have had their hopes of",42
NA,reconciliation and advancement sadly dashed.,42
NA,It will be judged by the miners and all those,42
NA,others who want commercial certainty and,42
NA,who have been denied it by the failure,42
NA,reach agreement on these issues. The governopposition.,42
NA,ment will be judged internationally by those,42
NA,who are all too conscious internationally of,42
NA,the long record of insensitivity this governall,42
NA,ment has chalked up on racial issues. And this,42
NA,government will be judged by the Australian,42
NA,"people, who do not want division and conposition",42
NA,"frontation, who do not want to see unleashed",42
NA,"all those forces of prejudice, fear, humiliation",42
NA,"and hurt that, whether intended or not, are",42
NA,"absolutely inevitable if we do proceed, as",42
NA,"seems inevitable, to a race based double",42
NA,dissolution.,42
Mr TIM FISCHER ,Farrer-Deputy Prime,42
NA,Minister) (9.05 a.m.-The government stands,42
NA,firm to deliver a practical solution to the,42
NA,problems associated with Wik. The Senate,42
NA,"was not able to do this and, therefore,",42
NA,"no,!\, a matter for the people to decide.",42
NA,I want to say for the benefit of members,42
NA,that I understand that there will be one,42
NA,sion at about quarter past nine on the amend-,42
NA,ments on which we disagree. On the amend-,42
NA,"ments on which we agree on both sides,",42
NA,obviously there will be no division. That,42
NA,might assist some last minute planning as we,42
NA,deal with this final debate on this very im-,42
NA,"portant piece of legislation, the Native Title",42
NA,Amendment Bill 1997 [No.2].,42
NA,"I want to say, in response to the Deputy",42
NA,"Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Gareth Evans),",42
NA,that the die was not cast before yesterday.,42
NA,"Indeed, as late as 10 o'clock last night the",42
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Howard) took the precau-,42
NA,tionary step of calling a joint party meeting to,42
NA,"explain the state of play, and even at the end",42
NA,of that meeting-if I can have your permis-,42
NA,sion to reveal this-the Prime Minister put a,42
NA,caveat that it may have to be resumed to,42
NA,consider any last minute changes in the,42
NA,four hours of sitting of the Senate.,42
NA,"law, In other words, we were prepared, right",42
NA,bill through to 2.15 this morning-in fact right,42
NA,through to the 7.30 cabinet meeting this,42
NA,willmorning-to look at any last minute changes,42
NA,"Alas, that was not to be the case. I accept",42
NA,the phraseology of the Deputy Leader of the,42
NA,Opposition that there were in a sense 20 main,42
NA,issues and on six of those 20 there was not,42
NA,to agreement between the government and the,42
NA,The four big issues were the right,42
NA,"to negotiate, Racial Discrimination Act alter-",42
NA,"ation, the sunset clause provision and, above",42
NA,"else, the threshold test provision, which",42
NA,was carried briefly in the Senate in favour of,42
NA,the government's longstanding lO-point plan,42
NA,but was of course reversed yesterday,42
NA,afternoon.,42
NA,I will go back to Longreach on Saturday. I,42
NA,now will make a point of going to Longreach to,42
NA,meet with a number of people at a function,42
NA,which is mainly associated with the 10th,42
NA,anniversary of .the Stockman's Hall of Fame.,42
NA,In the morning of that Saturday I will go to,42
NA,Winton to the opening of the new Matilda,42
NA,Centre and in the afternoon to the Stockman's,42
NA,Hall of Fame to unveil the 10th anniversary,42
NA,it is plaque. They will be magnificent iconic,42
NA,events in their own right. But I will take the,42
NA,opportunity to informally reiterate to the,42
NA,divipeople I meet with in Winton and Longreach,42
NA,"this Saturday that we gave an undertaking---':'""",43
NA,"the Prime Minister, John Howard, gave an",43
NA,absolute undertaking-that there was a fair,43
NA,lO-point plan and that we would not be,43
NA,"walking away from that lO-point plan, and I",43
NA,will say that that is exactly what we have,43
NA,done in the houses of parliament this particu-,43
NA,lar week and this particular moment.,43
NA,I note that one Independent has expressed,43
NA,particular interest this morning. The member,43
NA,who has been the most consistent of the,43
NA,Independents is the member for Calare ( Mr,43
NA,Andren). At every stage he has opposed,43
NA,giving the farmers a fair go in respect of the,43
NA,lO-point plan. I will allow this: he has been,43
NA,absolutely consistent on this; he has been,43
NA,absolutely consistent with the Labor Party on,43
NA,this. In respect of the member for Oxley (Ms,43
NA,"Hanson), sometimes she has been here and",43
NA,sometimes she has not. She has not even,43
NA,fronted for some of the key divisions on the,43
NA,Wik legislation.,43
NA,I want to conclude by quoting from a,43
NA,committee hearing in respect of native title.,43
NA,That committee hearing took place on 24,43
NA,September in Canberra. The member for Page,43
NA,"( Mr Causley) asked Mr Djerrkura, whom I",43
NA,"greatly respect, a couple of questions. I",43
NA,simply read from the transcript of that particu-,43
NA,lar deliberation of the committee at that,43
NA,meeting. The member for Page said:,43
NA,Many of the legal minds that we have had before,43
NA,the committee have said that they think the High,43
NA,"Court is saying that it is access to land for hunting,",43
NA,gathering and ceremonial rights. Do you agree with,43
NA,"that, or do you think that it is more than that? '",43
NA,Mr Djerrkura replied:,43
NA,Of course it is much more than that. . . It is,43
NA,being. The land is our mother . . . Particularly in,43
NA,"today's world, there is a willingness by indigenous",43
NA,people to participate in commercial activities.,43
NA,Fair enough. He went on to say:,43
NA,It is total ownership. It is a recognition of our,43
NA,rights to this country. That is what native title,43
NA,reflects. That is something we are not going to,43
NA,surrender.,43
NA,"This 10-point plan, this legislation, does not",43
NA,wipe out native title across mainland Austral-,43
NA,ia. It provides a fair process in accord with,43
NA,the utterances of Mr Djerrkura and others at,43
NA,that very key committee hearing last year.,43
NA,"What we are about is a fair outcome, an",43
NA,equality of rights and a determination which,43
NA,now must go before the people of Australia.,43
NA,(Time expired),43
Mr MELHAM ,Banks) (9.10 a.m.)-Ifthe,43
NA,Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 [No.2],43
NA,"forms part of a double dissolution trigger,",43
NA,then let us be under no mistake: it will be a,43
NA,race based election. It will be divisive and it,43
NA,will be ugly. Not only will the Prime Minister,43
NA,"( Mr Howard) have diminished his office, he",43
NA,will have diminished the nation and he will,43
NA,"have diminished each and everyone of us,",43
NA,because this is totally unnecessary. What has,43
NA,driven this is low grade politics and the fact,43
NA,that this government has been the captive of,43
NA,sectional interest.,43
NA,The first sticking point is the Racial Discri-,43
NA,mination Act. It was coalition policy that,43
NA,amendments to the Native Title Act would,43
NA,respect the Racial Discrimination Act. The,43
NA,Prime Minister repeated that in this parliament,43
NA,when questioned. He repeated that to every,43
NA,community group. The first sticking point was,43
NA,a core promise of this government both before,43
NA,and after the election and we will hold them,43
NA,"to it. We will hold them to it because, if one",43
NA,"reads Mabo, if one reads the,Western Austral-",43
NA,ian challenge to our Native Title Act and if,43
NA,"one reads Justice Brennan in the Wik case,",43
NA,one realises that without the Racial Discrimi-,43
NA,nation Act the states can extinguish native,43
NA,title. That is where the 'bucketfuls of,43
NA,extinguishment' are.,43
NA,"In relation to the second test, the threshold",43
NA,"test, this government seeks to make it harder",43
NA,for indigenous people to pursue native title,43
NA,a total claims under this act than it is under the,43
NA,common law. What will that do? It will drive,43
NA,indigenous people to the courts to assert their,43
NA,common law' rights. What does that do? It,43
NA,"creates delays, uncertainty and unworkability.",43
NA,Development will be at a standstill. What will,43
NA,a sunset clause do? It will repeat the mistakes,43
NA,of the framers of the constitution. In the,43
NA,1890s when the constitution was framed there,43
NA,were negative references to indigenous Aus-,43
NA,tralians because the framers thought that they,43
NA,"would not be with us much longer, that they",43
NA,would die and we would not have to worry,43
NA,about them in the constitution. So a sunset,43
NA,clause means that they are not going to be a,43
NA,problem in six months time or in six years,44
NA,time-a total misreading of what this act is,44
NA,"about, an alternative to the common law, an",44
NA,alternative that puts people at the table.,44
NA,The fourth sticking point is the right to,44
NA,negotiate-not a right of veto. The second,44
NA,explanatory memorandum of the government,44
NA,"at page 15, paragraph 3.15 says:",44
NA,The right to negotiate was not a veto.,44
NA,It is a right to be consulted. Why is it there?,44
NA,Because it is an intrinsic element of native,44
NA,"title. But, more importantly, if you want a",44
NA,constitutional bill and you want to acquire the,44
NA,"property rights, even of indigenous Austral-",44
NA,"ians, just terms acquisition requires consulta-",44
NA,"tion, a proper process. And, at the end of the",44
NA,"process, there is a right of override. The",44
NA,"Labor Party, from the outset, stood ready to",44
NA,provide a solution that had the broad support,44
NA,of the parliament. That was rejected by the,44
NA,Prime Minister.,44
NA,Senator Harradine set the bottom line on,44
NA,"this bill. because the Democrats, the Greens",44
NA,and Labor still did not have the numbers.,44
NA,"Senator Harradine-a decent,· honourable",44
NA,human being-gave the government two out,44
NA,of four of their sticking points and was told,44
NA,"by the Prime Minister, 'Not enough.' Why?",44
NA,Because they did not want a solution. They,44
NA,do not want an outcome because there is a,44
NA,Queensland election around the comer and,44
NA,they want some votes on this. I say this: you,44
NA,"might get an outcome that is not agreed to,",44
NA,but in the end you are .not above the courts,44
NA,and you are not above the constitution.,44
NA,"Justice MCHugh, one of the more conserva-",44
NA,"tive judges on the High Court, had this to say",44
NA,in the unreported judgment of the Waanyi,44
NA,case at page 52:,44
NA,The community will quickly lose confidence in,44
NA,courts of justice if a perception arises that the,44
NA,courts are ready to ignore the legal rights of,44
NA,individuals whenever intervening governments or,44
NA,litigants urge that public or private convenience,44
NA,requires such rights to -by-passed.,44
NA,That is what this debate has been about:,44
NA,ignoring the property rights of indigenous,44
NA,"Australians, ignoring the common law rights",44
NA,oUndigenous Australians-throwing them off,44
NA,the table. They went to our courts and had a,44
NA,terrific victory. We should have respected the,44
NA,High Court. This is a day of shame and the,44
NA,buck stops with the Prime Minister.,44
Mr BRADFORD ,MCPherson) (9.15,44
NA,a.m.)-This is a sad place and it is a sad day,44
NA,for Australia.,44
NA,Mr Truss-Rubbish.,44
Mr BRADFORD,You can say that. Let,44
NA,me make a few brief observations. I have,44
NA,been in this place for eight years and we have,44
NA,seen today exactly what happens here when,44
NA,the opposition puts a point of view. When,44
NA,"opposition leaders are speaking, government",44
NA,"members mostly walk out, and vice versa.",44
NA,There is no real attempt to sit and listen to,44
NA,each other and to talk about the issue.,44
Mr SPEAKER,I suggest the honourable,44
NA,member address the issue. He is not talking,44
NA,to general parliamentary procedures.,44
Mr BRADFORD,"I will, Mr Speaker. The",44
NA,Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 [No.2],44
NA,before us was an opportunity to unite Austral-,44
NA,"ia, but what is going to happen is that Aus-",44
NA,tralia will be further divided. It was an oppor-,44
NA,tunity to show the world that we could ad-,44
NA,dress these difficult matters in a mature and,44
NA,"sensitive way; instead, they have been ad-",44
NA,dressed in a clinical and insensitive way. This,44
NA,was apparently just another battlefield: it,44
NA,would be won or lost in a war of words.,44
NA,Our indigenous people are shackled by the,44
NA,constraints of welfare that have been placed,44
NA,upon them by previous governments. Native,44
NA,title for them is a substantial part of the,44
NA,solution to that problem. Of course equality,44
NA,before the law is important for all Australians,44
NA,"and it is an issue, but equality in the terms",44
NA,described by the Prime Minister ( Mr Howard),44
NA,this morning misrepresents the situation-and,44
NA,that has been the flaw in the government's,44
NA,the position throughout in this debate. The true,44
NA,situation has been constantly clouded by the,44
NA,holding up of maps and speaking of non-,44
NA,"existent vetos, 'of claims about suburban back-",44
NA,yards being at risk when that patently was not,44
NA,true.,44
NA,The privacy and amenity of pastoralists,44
NA,should be protected. But I want to say to,44
NA,you-I have thought about this long and,44
NA,deep-that native title without the right to,44
NA,negotiate is meaningless. I believe that in the,44
NA,context of this debate coexistence and a,45
NA,representation of all Australians' interests,45
NA,could have been achieved. We talk about the,45
NA,issue of taking care of pastoralists' rights-,45
NA,and that is a land management issue and that,45
NA,"could be handled at the state level, but here",45
NA,in this place for us it is an issue about the,45
NA,"future of our kids, both black and white.",45
NA,Yesterday my heart broke to see those gentle,45
NA,people walk out of this place in tears and,45
NA,distress.,45
NA,"Government members-Ha, hal",45
Mr BRADFORD,You laugh. Have you,45
NA,been to talk to them? Have you been to sit,45
NA,down and deal with them? Let me tell you my,45
NA,experience in dealing with them. They are a,45
NA,gentle people. They are not articulate on your,45
NA,terms. To talk with them you have to listen.,45
NA,We should be ashamed of the state of our,45
NA,"indigenous people. This is an affluent society,",45
NA,yet many of our indigenous people live in,45
NA,abject poverty. We condemned genocide in,45
NA,other countries-and rightly so-yet we are,45
NA,responsible for a genocide in our own nation,45
NA,and we cannot even say sorry.,45
NA,Tomorrow is Easter. The message of Easter,45
NA,is one of reconciliation. The greatest chal-,45
NA,lenge facing our nation is reconciliation. I,45
NA,believe that in this debate today and in our,45
NA,rush to get away-and all of that is under-,45
NA,standable-we have missed an opportunity to,45
NA,achieve coexistence and reconciliation. I,45
NA,"believe it is possible, but the opportunities to Grace, E. L. *",45
NA,achieve that in this century may have passed,45
NA,us by.,45

NA,Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence,46
NA,"Industry, Science and Personnel, without",46
NA,"notice, on 8 April 1998:",46
NA,My question is directed to the Minister for,46
NA,"Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. Minister,",46
NA,are you aware of repeated approaches that have,46
NA,"been made to your office, going back to August of",46
NA,"1996, from Lt Col. Harry Smith, retired, who was",46
NA,the officer who commanded D Company 6 RAR at,46
NA,the Battle of Long Tan on 18 August 1966? Why,46
NA,have you not investigated Colonel Smith's allega-,46
NA,tions that his recommendations for Military Cross,46
NA,awards for two of his platoon commanders in that,46
NA,battle were destroyed and th-t they were given a,46
NA,"lesser award, one that was also handed out to the",46
NA,postal clerk at Vung Tau? Why did you refuse to,46
NA,investigate these matters J>efore closing the End,46
NA,"War List for the Vietnam War, and will you now",46
NA,give the House an undertaking that these issues will,46
NA,be fully investigated and that the Australian,46
NA,"soldiers, who clearly displayed gallant and distin-",46
NA,guished service in action at the Battle of Long,46
NA,are properly recognised.,46
NA,Mrs Bishop-The answer to the honourable,46
NA,member's question is as follows:,46
NA,PAIRS I am aware of LTCOL Harry Smith correspond-,46
NA,ence concerning nominations for military awards in,46
NA,the Battle of Long Tan ..,46
NA,LTCOL Smith raised the issue with this Govern-,46
NA,"ment on three occasions, with the Prime Minister",46
NA,"in August 1996, with my Senior Adviser in May",46
NA,1997 and with me ill December 1997. The letter of,46
NA,August 1996 being to the Prime Minister was in,46
NA,part referred to my office for response which was,46
NA,given by my Senior Adviser. It was also dealt with,46
NA,by the PM's Parliamentary Secretary. Tlie May,46
NA,1997 letter written to my Senior Adviser was,46
NA,responded to in full. Correspondence relevant to Mr,46
NA,Bevis's question is set out below.,46
NA,"LTCOL Smith's second letter, being the letter to",46
NA,my Senior Adviser is a lengthy eight page letter,46
NA,largely dealing with his recollection of the Battle,46
NA,of Long Tan and the difficulties he had. with his,46
NA,immediate commander. This letter was also re-,46
NA,sponded to.,46
NA,"In his only· letter to me on 16 December 1997, he",46
NA,again traverses the same ground but asks that the,46
NA,"matters raised by him be treated as a special case,",46
NA,hI which is not in line with Government policy. As,46
NA,was stated to him it is only possible to include,46
NA,people on the End of War List who were recom-,46
NA,this day. mended at the highest level in Vietnam. This letter,46
NA,is still with the Department. .,46
NA,I have retrieved from our records the recommenda-,46
NA,tion for Honours and Awards in respect of the two,46
NA,platoon commanders of concern to LTCOL Smith.,46
NA,The recommendations were made by the Com-,46
NA,"manding Officer of 6RAR, countersigned by the",46
NA,Commander of the First Australian Taskforce and,46
NA,the Commander Australian Force Vietnam. The,46
NA,awards recommended were for Mention In Dis-,46
NA,patches which were in fact made. It is important to,46
NA,"point out that at the time of the Vietnam War, the",46
NA,MID was awarded for both meritorious service,46
NA,under adverse conditions and for acts of bravery,46
NA,under fire.,46
NA,It does not reflect well on Mr Bevis to disparage,46
NA,the award given to one individual while trying to,46
NA,promote the worthiness of others.,46
NA,This is just another legacy of the Labor,46
NA,Government's thirteen years of inaction and bad,46
NA,policy which this Government has to clean up.,46
NA,This Government did promise that if further cases,46
NA,of come to light of recommendations for Honours and,46
NA,"Awards which meet the Government's criteria, (i.e.",46
NA,being recommended at the highest level in Vietnam,46
NA,and then either not awarded or down graded) we,46
NA,would deal with those cases. Indeed one such,46
NA,instance has been found and the name of the,46
NA,"Tan, individual forwarded to Government House.",46
NA,NOTICES,46
NA,The following notices were given:,46
NA,Miss Jackie Kelly to move:,47
NA,That this House:,47
NA,(1) recognises that the former Labor Government,47
NA,created a child care system which was based,47
NA,on inequitable funding practices such as,47
NA,operational subsidies;,47
NA,(2) agrees that the Government's reform of the,47
NA,child care system provides for an equitable,47
NA,distribution of money between low and middle,47
NA,income families and the creation of an extra,47
NA,83 000 places over the next four years;,47
NA,(3) notes and supports the Government's alloca-,47
NA,tion of $4.9 billion to the child care system,47
NA,over the next four years;,47
NA,(4) calls on the Opposition to stop its campaign of,47
NA,misinformation to parents which threatens to,47
NA,do long-term damage to the child care sector,47
NA,as a whole;,47
NA,(5) notes that due to this Government's reforms,47
NA,low and middle income families are now,47
NA,better off than under the previous Government;,47
NA,and,47
NA,(6) condemns the former Labor Government for,47

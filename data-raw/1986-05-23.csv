NA,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE: DAIRY,14
NA,Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders,14
NA,Motion (by Mr Young) proposed:,14
NA,That-,14
NA,"(I) standing order 48A (adjournment of House), as",14
NA,"amended by sessional order, be suspended for",14
NA,"this sitting, and",14
NA,(2) in relation to the proceedings on the following,14
NA,"Bills, so much of the standing and sessional",14
NA,ders be suspended as would prevent the Leader,14
NA,of the House making one declaration of urgency,14
NA,and moving one motion for the allotment of time,14
NA,in respect of all the Bills:,14
NA,Dairy Produce Bill 1986;,14
NA,Dairy Produce Levy (No.1) Bill 1986;,14
NA,Dairy Produce Levy (No.2) Bill 1986;,14
NA,Dairying Industry Research and Promotion Levy,14
NA,(Termination of Levy) Bill 1986;,14
NA,Dairying Industry Stabilization Levy (Termina-,14
NA,tion of Levy) Bill 1986; and,14
NA,Dairy Legislation (Transitional Provisions and,14
NA,Consequential Amendments) Bill 1986.,14
Mr SINCLAIR ,New England-Manager of,14
NA,Opposition Business) (1O.02)-This is yet an-,14
NA,other illustration of a country which has run,14
NA,"amok, with a Government that does not know",14
NA,where it is going or what it is up to. We began,14
NA,"the week with the country in disaster, with the",14
NA,banana republic syndrome alive and well. The,14
NA,bull had well and truly grabbed the Treasurer,14
NA,( Mr Keating) by the tail. This motion today is,14
NA,designed yet again to restrict the opportunities,14
NA,for members to debate issues that are of funda-,14
NA,mental importance. Today we have a package of,14
NA,dairy legislation-not one Bill but six. We will,14
NA,be allowed only a restricted amount of time to,14
NA,debate them. There will be no opportunity for,14
NA,members who are affected electorally by this,14
NA,measure to give the matter adequate,14
NA,consideration.,14
NA,We well understand that the only reason the,14
NA,motion has been moved is that the Government,14
NA,has not been able to get its act together. For,14
NA,"example, it is really quite incredible that, over",14
NA,"this past week, having had nine months to intro-",14
NA,"duce the legislation on capital gains tax, the",14
NA,Government did not have the explanatory mem-,14
NA,orandum ready to present to the House. Today,14
NA,"we will be expected, in the course of a few",14
NA,"hours, to deliberate on measures that will affect",14
NA,the lives and livelihoods of thousands of dairy,14
NA,farmers around this nation. The Opposition does,14
NA,not accept that it is necessary to have a guillo-,14
NA,tine affecting these measures.,14
NA,Of all the measures that have been before the,14
NA,"LEGISLATION Parliament, the changes introduced in this area",14
NA,demonstrate as much as anything that the Gov-,14
NA,ernment does not know where it is going. We,14
NA,should understand that this is about the third,14
NA,separate package that has been presented to us,14
NA,in this area. The industry is still far from happy.,14
NA,Many people in various States see the Govern-,14
NA,ment's intrusion as preventing altogether their,14
NA,opportunity to carryon their business as they,14
NA,orwould wish. We are concerned that all the issues,14
NA,relating to the measure should be adequately,14
NA,"debated, but with a guillotine it is impossible to",14
NA,do so. On that basis the Opposition does not,14
NA,support the motion and will vote against it.,14

Mr YOUNG ,Port Adelaide-Leader of the,15

NA,"urgent Bills: Dairy Produce Bill 1986, Dairy",15
NA,"Produce Levy (No, 1) Bill 1986, Dairy Produce",15
NA,"Levy (No, 2) Bill 1986, Dairying Industry Re-",15

Mr CADMAN ,It is impossible to hear.,15
NA,Madam SPEAKER-Order! If honourable,15
NA,"members drop the level of conversation a bit,",15
NA,everybody will be able to hear.,15
NA,Mr Cowan-We are very interested in these,15
NA,Bills; we are very concerned about the dairy,15
NA,industry and we want to talk about it. We have,15
NA,not heard what the Leader of the House has,15
NA,said.,15
NA,Madam SPEAKER-Will the honourable,15
NA,member resume his seat? We will check about,15
NA,the microphones.,15
NA,"Mr Donald Cameron-On a point of order,",15
NA,Madam Speaker: Honourable members have not,15
NA,heard what they are being asked to--,15
NA,NOES,15

NA,Allotment of Time,15
Mr YOUNG ,Port Adelaide-Leader of the,15
NA,"MCVeigh, D. T.",15
NA,"Miles, C. G.",15
NA,House) (10.13)-1 move:,15
NA,That the time allotted in connection with the Bills be,15
NA,as follows-,15
NA,Would the honourable member for Moreton,15
NA,please listen?,15
NA,Madam SPEAKER-If honourable members,15
NA,stop speaking the House will be able to hear.,15
NA,"Shipton, R. F.",15
NA,"Sinclair, I. MCC.",15
NA,Honourable members have just complained about,15
NA,not being able to hear.,15
Mr YOUNG,I move:,15
NA,That the time allotted in connection with the Bills be,15
NA,as follows:,15
NA,PAIRS,15
NA,"(I) Dairy Produce Bill 1986; For the remaining stages,",15
NA,"until 4,00 p,m, this day,",15
NA,(2) Dairy Produce Levy (No. I) Bill 1986; For the,15
NA,"remaining stages, until 4.05 p.m. this day.",15
NA,(3) Dairy Produce Levy (No.2) Bill 1986; For the,15
NA,"remaining stages, until 4.10 p.m. this day.",15
NA,(4) Dairying Industry Research and Promotion Levy,15
NA,(Termination of Levy) Bill 1986; For the remain-,15
NA,"ing stages, until 4.15 p.m. this day.",15
NA,(5) Dairy Industry Stabilization Levy (Termination,15
NA,"of Levy) Bill 1986. For the remaining stages,",15
NA,until 4.20 p.m. this day.,15
NA,(6) Dairy Legislation (Transitional Provisions and,15
NA,Consequential Amendments) Bill 1966; For the,15
NA,"remaining stages, until 4,25 p,m, this day.",15
NA,"In so moving, I say that the Opposition and the",15
NA,"Government members are aware, of course, that",15
NA,the Government has had an additional discipline,15
NA,placed on it in terms of getting the business,15
NA,through the House. We are not setting a partic-,15
NA,ularly onerous task in terms of legislation that is,15
NA,coming before the House. The business we have,15
NA,set down this week and next week is of partic-,15
NA,ular urgency because the coalition has decided,15
NA,that it will not deal with any legislation in the,15
NA,Senate which the Senate receives after next,15
NA,Thursday. That is the decision that the Opposi-,15
NA,tion has to sit with. All the business set down,15
NA,for this week and all the business that is set,15
NA,down for next week will have to be completed,15
NA,by next Thursday night because the Opposi-,15
NA,tion-the Liberal Party of Australia and the,15
NA,National Party of Australia-have decided to,15
NA,"break another convention, and that is that the",15
NA,Senate will not deal with legislation which passes,15
NA,through the House of Representatives after next,15
NA,Thursday night. It is a matter of urgency that,15
NA,this Government must deal with the legislation,16
NA,set down. It may be that in the next session the,16
NA,Opposition will decide that it will deal only with,16
NA,matters that go through the House of Represen-,16
NA,"tatives in the first four weeks of the sitting, in",16
NA,which case we will have to compress all the,16
NA,legislation into the first four weeks. The Oppo-,16
NA,sition should have realised what it was doing,16
NA,"when it took the decision, which imposes a new",16
NA,restriction on the Government. It will just have,16
NA,to live with the consequences. The consequences,16
NA,of its decision are that members of the House of,16
NA,Representatives will have less time to debate,16
NA,these Bills than they otherwise would have had.,16
Mr SINCLAIR ,New England-Manager of,16
NA,Opposition Business) (10.16) - It had not been,16
NA,"my intention to respond, but the Leader of the",16
NA,House ( Mr Young) has stated an entirely incor-,16
NA,rect version of the facts. It should be understood,16
NA,that this G;)vernment cannot get its act together.,16
NA,All that babble and rabble on the other side who,16
NA,are temporarily sitting on the Government,16
NA,benches should understand that if those few,16
NA,sitting on the front bench cannot get their legis-,16
NA,"lative program right, if all those Caucus commit-",16
NA,tees cannot conclude their deliberations,16
NA,sufficiently early for them to come into this,16
NA,place and be considered adequately so that they,16
NA,can be passed by the Senate in a reasonable,16
NA,"time, they can expect that restraints such as",16
NA,those in the resolution to which the Leader of,16
NA,the House referred will continue to be imposed,16
NA,on them.,16
NA,The purpose of the Senate resolution is to tell,16
NA,the Government to pull its finger out and to get,16
NA,its work done. What the Government is doing is,16
NA,essentially sitting on its hands. It is not prepared,16
NA,to undertake a proper and correct basis for,16
NA,consideration of serious matters which affect the,16
NA,people of Australia. The only way in which the,16
NA,Senate and this place can adequately consider,16
NA,legislation and get their work done is for mem-,16
NA,"bers of the Government, instead of tripping away",16
NA,"overseas, to stay in Australia. We have the Prime",16
NA,Minister ( Mr Hawke) out in the boondocks of,16
NA,China; I am delighted to see the Minister for,16
NA,Immigration and Ethnic Affairs ( Mr Hurford),16
NA,"here today, but he has been away; the Minister",16
NA,for Foreign Affairs ( Mr Hayden) is away. If,16
NA,"they do not want to have guillotines, Ministers",16
NA,"should stay in Australia, conclude their work",16
NA,and give the Parliamentary Counsel instructions.,16
NA,Nobody in this place would then be in the,16
NA,position of having to have such a ridiculous,16
NA,guillotine motion as this before them for consid-,16
NA,eration. The only reason for the guillotine is that,16
NA,the Leader of the House has not been able to,16
NA,marshal his troops. We know that the Prime,16
NA,Minister has lost control. We know that the,16
NA,telephone has taken over from the Cabinet table.,16
NA,We know that no longer are matters of very,16
NA,significant public importance being considered in,16
NA,the way they should be. As far as this House is,16
NA,"concerned, we are not prepared to take the",16
NA,consequences and have guillotines imposed on us,16
NA,simply because the Government is not doing its,16
NA,"job adequately, quickly, or in time.",16
NA,The purpose of this motion is not in any way,16
NA,related to the suggestions the Leader of the,16
NA,House has put forward; it is entirely related to,16
NA,the Government not getting its act together early,16
NA,"enough, not getting the legislative instructions to",16
NA,the Parliamentary Counsel on time. We are here,16
NA,this morning just because the Government could,16
NA,"not get its act together. Consequently, we have",16
NA,a motion which will give minimal time for de-,16
NA,bating a very serious package of Bills. We do,16
NA,not accept the admonition from the Leader of,16
NA,"the House, and we commend the Senate for",16
NA,trying to bring the Government under some sort,16
NA,of disciplinary approach.,16
Mr SCHOLES ,Corio-Minister for Territo-,16
NA,ries) (10.19)-Having listened to the Leader of,16
NA,the National Party and Manager of Opposition,16
NA,"Business ( Mr Sinclair), we can understand why",16
NA,those opposite are in opposition. At least he had,16
NA,the common decency to laugh while he was,16
NA,making that stupid statement.,16
Mr TUCKEY ,O'Connor) (10.20)-Madam,16
NA,Speaker--,16
NA,Mr Wright-Are you cartoon time?,16
NA,Madam SPEAKER-Order!,16
Mr TUCKEY,You will never make a car-,16
NA,"toon, son; you are so irrelevant. Madam",16
NA,Speaker--,16
NA,Madam SPEAKER-Order! Is the honoura-,16
NA,ble member for O'Connor speaking to the mo-,16
NA,tion before the Chair?,16
Mr TUCKEY,"Yes, certainly, Madam",16
NA,Speaker. The Leader of the House ( Mr Young),16
NA,has said that debate on these measures will be,16
NA,curtailed because of decisions taken in the Sen-,16
NA,ate. These measures are the result of an an-,16
NA,nouncement in this Parliament on 19 September,16
NA,"1985. Furthermore, you got your instructions",16
NA,from Bill Kelty on 3 February 1985 when he,16
NA,made his speech to the Socialist Forum and he,16
NA,spelt out the tax measures chapter and verse.,16
NA,You have known since 3 February 1985 what,16
NA,"you were going to do, and you still have not got",16
NA,the legislation passed. That is a fact: You got,16
NA,your instructions on 3 February 1985. You can,16
NA,read in the Sydney Morning Herald that Bill,17
NA,Kelty spelt out his instructions to you at the,17
NA,Socialist Forum in Melbourne. Why are you,17
NA,wasting all that time getting your Bills together?,17
NA,The capital gains tax has been imposed on Aus-,17
NA,tralians--,17
NA,"Mr O'Keefe-I take a point of order, Madam",17
NA,Speaker. These comments are not only irrele-,17
NA,vant; they are mendacious.,17
NA,Madam SPEAKER-Order! The honourable,17
NA,member wiJJ resume his seat.,17
NA,Government members interjecting-,17
NA,Madam SPEAKER-Order! If honourable,17
NA,"members on my right will be quiet, they will",17
NA,save some time.,17
Mr TUCKEY,"Madam Speaker, the capital",17
NA,gains tax has been imposed on Australians since,17
NA,19 September. This legislation has just seen the,17
NA,"light of day, and you are going to use this sort",17
NA,of excuse. You could have brought it in on the,17
NA,first day of this sitting. You have had since 19,17
NA,"September. In fact, I repeat that you have had",17
NA,"since 3 February 1985, when Bill Kelty told you",17
NA,what you were going to do. That was five months,17
NA,"before your tax summit, when your blooming",17
NA,arrogant Treasurer ( Mr Keating) told you he,17
NA,had his cart running on four wheels. That was,17
NA,the situation.,17
NA,"Mr Robert Brown-I take a point of order,",17
NA,Madam Speaker.,17
Mr TUCKEY,"Is it hurting, Robert? Is it",17
NA,hurting?,17
NA,Madam SPEAKER-Order! If the House will,17
NA,"be quiet, the Chair might hear the point of order",17
NA,from the honourable member for Charlton.,17
NA,Members on my right are not assisting the Chair.,17
NA,"Mr Robert Brown-Madam Speaker, my point",17
NA,of order concerns the fact that the honourable,17
NA,member for O'Connor is casting very serious,17
NA,"aspersions against you as Speaker, because he is",17
NA,saying that 'you' received 'your' instructions from,17
NA,Mr Kelty.,17
NA,Madam SPEAKER -Order! The honourable,17
NA,member will resume his seat.,17
Mr TUCKEY,"Thank you, Madam Speaker.",17
NA,Might I repeat: So you did. BiJJ Kelty laid your,17
NA,instructions down on 3 February 1985.,17
NA,Madam SPEAKER-Order! The honourable,17
NA,member for O'Connor should speak through the,17
NA,Chair.,17
NA,"Mr Robert Brown-I take a point of order,",17
NA,Madam Speaker. My point of order is quite,17
NA,clear. Honourable members are required to speak,17
NA,to and through the Chair.,17
NA,Madam SPEAKER-I have just reminded the,17
NA,honourable member for O'Connor to speak,17
NA,through the Chair.,17
NA,Mr Robert Brown-The honourable member,17
NA,should be required to withdraw.,17
NA,Madam SPEAKER-The honourable mem-,17
NA,ber will resume his seat.,17
Mr TUCKEY,"Madam Speaker, let me ad-",17
NA,dress it to you-and I am sure that you did not,17
NA,get your instructions at that time. I am referring,17
NA,to the Ministers and others who have had all,17
NA,that time to bring this important legislation down.,17
NA,The Treasurer gave us his brown paper bag,17
NA,lecture again today. Where do they think their,17
NA,fringe benefit taxes are going to end up? They,17
NA,will end up right in that brown paper lunch bag.,17
NA,It will be the working people who pay them. Do,17
NA,they think the big companies are going to lower-,17
NA,Madam SPEAKER-Order! Will the honour-,17
NA,able member for O'Connor speak to the motion,17
NA,before the Chair?,17
Mr TUCKEY,"Yes, Madam Speaker. We",17
NA,have suddenly been put under all this pressure,17
NA,to try to carry out the business of the Parlia-,17
NA,ment. We have only been here for the last three,17
NA,months! During all that time we have been given,17
NA,"very little legislation. All of a sudden, all these",17
NA,very difficult things have hit the people of Aus-,17
NA,tralia. We would like to explain to Labor mem-,17
NA,bers that their fringe benefits tax will end up in,17
NA,"those brown paper lunch bags, because the big",17
NA,companies will increase their prices. They will,17
NA,not reduce their dividends; they cannot afford to,17
NA,with the company takeover situation that Labor,17
NA,members now tolerate. They will do that. The,17
NA,point I am making is--,17
NA,Madam SPEAKER-Will the honourable,17
NA,member stick to the matter before the Chair?,17
Mr TUCKEY,The point I am making is that,17
NA,it is in Labor members' own interests to give us,17
NA,the time to debate these matters. They first,17
NA,knew on 3 February 1985 that they were going,17
NA,to enact this legislation. As I am worried that,17
NA,the honourable member for Charlton is going to,17
NA,"get tired jumping up and down, I will give him",17
NA,a break and sit down.,17
Mr YOUNG ,Port Adelaide-Leader of the,17
NA,House) (10.25)-in reply-It is interesting to,17
NA,"see how the Manager of Opposition Business,",17
NA,the right honourable member for New England,17
NA,"( Mr Sinclair), and the honourable member for",17
NA,O'Connor ( Mr Tuckey) have done everything,18
NA,possible to stop their colleagues from the Na-,18
NA,tional Party of Australia talking about this,18
NA,ying legislation. We could have been debating it,18
NA,20 minutes ago. The Opposition has used up all,18
NA,this time because it knows that the essence of,18
NA,this debate will be a vote of congratulations for,18
NA,"the Minister for Primary Industry ( Mr Kerin),",18
NA,who has done such an excellent job in the dairy,18
NA,"industry, the sugar industry and the beef indus-",18
NA,try. He is the best Minister for Primary Industry,18
NA,that this country has ever seen.,18
NA,Let me tell honourable members something,18
NA,else. When members of the coalition in the Sen-,18
NA,ate decided not to deal with new legislation after,18
NA,next Thursday night they did not tell this mob,18
NA,here; they just voted on it in the Senate and told,18
NA,them the result. So when the Manager of Op-,18
NA,position Business said that he supports his col-,18
NA,"leagues in the Senate, he supports them de facto,",18
NA,because he was not asked for his views. He was,18
NA,told what they would do. This is the role the,18
NA,Opposition gave the Senate in 1975: It placed,18
NA,the Senate on a pedestal by saying that the,18
NA,Senate is more important than the House of,18
NA,"government, the House of Representatives.",18
NA,This session of Parliament has been a far,18
NA,busier session than the Fraser Government ever,18
NA,had. It will sit for 11 weeks and it will deal with,18
NA,"a multiplicity of legislation, something which the",18
NA,Fraser Government never did. I will tell honour-,18
NA,able members something else. I can recommend,18
NA,some reading to honourable members over the,18
NA,weekend. I am reading Patrick O'Brien's book,18
NA,on the Liberal Party of Australia and I recom-,18
NA,mend it to everybody. I have just got to the,18
NA,"stage when, after the 1983 election, Malcolm",18
NA,wrote to Reg Withers apologising for sacking,18
NA,"him. Reg said: Too bloody late, mate'. I suggest",18
NA,that honourable members opposite read that book,18
NA,on the Liberal Party so that they can see how it,18
NA,carried out its policies as promised by the gov-,18
NA,ernments of 1975-77 and 1977-80.,18
NA,The Opposition has deliberately taken up the,18
NA,time of the House. This matter could have been,18
NA,dealt with by three minutes past 10 but the,18
NA,Opposition decided that it did not want to put,18
NA,up all its donkeys from cockies corner to argue,18
NA,with the Minister for Primary Industry.,18
NA,"Mr Cowan-Madam Speaker, I raise a point",18

NA,1986. Last May the Opposition took a strong,18
NA,"stand in defence of the Australian dairy industry,",19
NA,a stand which is fully vindicated by these revised,19
NA,dairy marketing Bills. The return of these Bills,19
NA,in a form more acceptable to the dairying indus-,19
NA,try is a salutary political lesson for the Hawke,19
NA,Labor Government. Honourable members will,19
NA,recall that the faked breakthrough in the talks,19
NA,on a national marketing plan two days before,19
NA,the Victorian election dissolved into thin air,19
NA,after the Cain Government was re-elected by a,19
NA,bare margin.,19
NA,Mr Tim Fischer-It was a sham.,19
Mr HUNT,It was a sham.,19
NA,"Mr Hawker-It was a con, a real con.",19
Mr HUNT,It was a disgrace. It was the,19
NA,greatest political con trick ever played upon,19
NA,people in that State. In its place came a dracon-,19
NA,ian set of Bills which threatened to decimate the,19
NA,$340m export sector of our dairy industry and,19
NA,"send hundreds, if not thousands, of producers to",19
NA,the wall. No wonder this country is in such,19
NA,difficulty with balance of trade,19
NA,der the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) is talking about,19
NA,Australia being likely to become a banana re-,19
NA,public unless it improves its performance. When,19
NA,a government pays such scant regard to an ex-,19
NA,port industry and treats the seventh largest ex-,19
NA,port industry of this country in the way in which,19
NA,it attempted to treat it last year with its dairy,19
NA,"legislation, there is no doubt that it has no real",19
NA,concern about the export sector of Australian,19
NA,industry.,19
NA,If that legislation had passed the Parliament,19
NA,it would have gravely impaired the efficiency of,19
NA,an important domestic and export industry which,19
NA,"has already rationalised from 49,000 to 19,000",19
NA,farms in 30 years. It would have created untold,19
NA,social hardship to thousands of dairy farming,19
NA,"families, but clearly this Government could not",19
NA,have cared less because they were only farmers.,19
NA,The Opposition sought the removal of anti-in-,19
NA,"dustry provisions in the Bills last May, and with",19
NA,the support of the Australian Democrats in an-,19
NA,other place we stopped the so-called Kerin plan,19
NA,in its tracks.,19
NA,"Mr Cunningham-Ha, hal What a joke!",19
Mr HUNT,That is true. The honourable,19
NA,member laughs. The chairman of a parliamen-,19
NA,tary committee of the Australian Labor Party is,19
NA,running around the countryside trying to shore,19
NA,up some confidence in a Party that has kicked,19
NA,"in the teeth the farm industries of Australia,",19
NA,causing so much hardship and heartbreak,19
NA,amongst the familIes that are struggling to make,19
NA,ends meet. Our action gave the industry two,19
NA,vital breaks. It gave some breathing space to the,19
NA,industry. The industry also had a far stronger,19
NA,hand with which to go back to the negotiating,19
NA,table with the Hawke Labor Government. The,19
NA,Opposition and the Democrats saved producers,19
NA,tens of millions of dollars through its actions in,19
NA,this Parliament. This could not have come at a,19
NA,more important time for the industry. This year,19
NA,soon dairy farmers will each earn an average net,19
NA,"income of $4,400 for their 12 months' work-a",19
NA,quarter of average weekly earnings.,19
NA,Mr Nehl-Not enough.,19
Mr HUNT,"As the honourable member says,",19
NA,it is not enough. Dairy farmers' incomes will be,19
NA,at levels that the Australian Council of Trade,19
NA,Unions would not accept in a fit. Both the,19
NA,Opposition and the industry have every reason,19
NA,to be pleased with our achievement on behalf of,19
NA,"the Australian dairy industry, the manufacturers",19
NA,and the employees that work within the indus-,19
NA,try. In a letter to me this week the President of,19
NA,"the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation, Mr",19
NA,"deficits. No won- Pat Rowley, told me:",19
NA,"In summary, the legislation now before the Parlia-",19
NA,ment is not perfect but is vastly superior to that which,19
NA,was before us this time last year.,19
NA,"In money terms, it will be worth tens of millions of",19
NA,dollars more to the industry.,19
NA,On behalf of the Australian Dairy Farmers Federa-,19
NA,tion I would like to thank you for the part you played,19
NA,in bringing this about.,19
NA,"At this point, it is appropriate that I pay",19
NA,strong tribute to the untiring efforts of Mr Row-,19
NA,"ley, his predecessor, Mr Bennett, and the count-",19
NA,less other industry leaders and executive officers,19
NA,who have given so much of their time and re-,19
NA,sources to negotiate a more acceptable market-,19
NA,ing plan on the industry's behalf. Their job has,19
NA,not been easy. They have had to marry the,19
NA,vastly different interests of producers in various,19
NA,States-a job which was made ever so much,19
NA,harder by the antagonistic attitudes of some La-,19
NA,bor State governments. The efforts of these in-,19
NA,"dustry chiefs have been, simply, quite outstanding.",19
NA,"Unfortunately, the Hawke Labor Government",19
NA,can take little credit. It has played the dairy,19
NA,farmers as political pawns and fools. The farm-,19
NA,ers were led to believe that they had won their,19
NA,long-awaited agreement between the State gov-,19
NA,ernments when Premier Cain intervened in a,19
NA,"blaze of publicity, two days before his election.",19
NA,"Once again, primary producers have found that",19
NA,the Australian Labor Party cannot be trusted.,19
NA,Less than three weeks after the Victorian elec-,19
NA,"tion, the farmers were dumped.",19
NA,The Federal Minister for Primary Industry,19
NA,( Mr Kerin) claimed in a stroke of blinding en-,19
NA,lightenment that the plan settled three weeks,20
NA,earlier on the eve of the Victorian election had,20
NA,some 'internal inconsistencies'. That plan had,20
NA,been under negotiation for two years! This Hawke,20
NA,Labor Government stands condemned for its,20
NA,blatant expediency at the cost of the producers.,20
NA,No sooner was the industry dumped than the,20
NA,Kerin plan hit the Parliament. I cannot recall a,20
NA,"more savage, anti-industry piece of legislation",20
NA,than the Kerin plan in its original form. Produc-,20
NA,ers were given no time to adjust to the sudden,20
NA,abandonment of mechanisms which had been in,20
NA,place for many years.,20
NA,Mr Hawker-Less than two months.,20
Mr HUNT,Exactly. The stated aim was to,20
NA,"cut production, but the real thrust was to dampen",20
NA,an inflation rate now running at three times the,20
NA,Western world average by reducing the domestic,20
NA,price of dairy products.,20
NA,NA,20
Mr HUNT,That is what it is-a consumers',20
NA,Bill to satisfy the provisions of the accord. That,20
NA,is what it is all about.,20
NA,"Mr Cunningham-Ha, hal",20
Mr HUNT,The honourable member for,20
NA,MCMillan can smile; he can laugh. He is a,20
NA,"decent fellow, but how can he live with people",20
NA,who are ripping the insides out of those good,20
NA,people he represents down in the MCMillan elec-,20
NA,torate? Let me remind him and the House that,20
NA,"a bottle of fresh milk, delivered daily to the",20
NA,"home if required, still costs less than 50c.",20
NA,"1970 as a base of 100, the price of milk has",20
NA,risen to 341 and butter to 260 in 15 years. The,20
NA,consumer price index over that time has risen to,20
NA,"389. In other words, the dairy industry has taken",20
NA,a real price cut over the past 15 years.,20
NA,I refuse to accept that the efficient farm in-,20
NA,dustries should be attacked in order to cut La-,20
NA,bor's inflation rate. We will fight such moves,20
NA,"the way. Last year, in an act of conciliation,",20
NA,Australian Dairy Farmers Federation agreed to,20
NA,negotiate on the Minister's plan. It is pleasing,20
NA,that the Opposition's stand on the three major,20
NA,areas of contention with the original Kerin plan,20
NA,has borne fruit. Two of our amendments sought,20
NA,an orderly phase-out of product levies. This has,20
NA,been achieved. We also sought to delay the,20
NA,abolition of export pooling for two years.,20
NA,By deferring the Bills we have achieved 15,20
NA,"months, which has at least given producers some",20
NA,time to anticipate the changes and adjust their,20
NA,"on-farm planning. Equally, manufacturers and",20
NA,exporters have had the chance to study the,20
NA,changes and adjust their decisions accordingly.,20
NA,This may be seen in part in recent co-operative,20
NA,"mergers, notably in Victoria. Since moving those",20
NA,"amendments, the Opposition has consistently",20
NA,supported the industry on other remaining mat-,20
NA,"ters, including an increase in the domestic value",20
NA,of leviable products and the insertion of a safety,20
NA,clause governing the all milk levy.,20
NA,Under this Government domestic product,20
NA,prices have remained frozen for four years. I,20
NA,think the last rise was in December 1982. Yet,20
NA,"this Government, with its policy of indexation",20
NA,"of wages, with what it says is its concern for the",20
NA,"working people of Australia, was prepared to let",20
NA,prices in the dairy industry stay pegged for a,20
NA,four-year period. No wonder there has been so,20
NA,much antagonism and anger. When the Prime,20
NA,Minister ( Mr Hawke) went to Echuca and met,20
NA,"a dairy farming family, no wonder he came back",20
NA,emotionally distressed. He was in the home of,20
NA,that Echuca family. He could see the difficulties,20
NA,under which they were struggling. The Prime,20
NA,Minister was moved--,20
NA,Mr Nehl-But only while the cameras were,20
NA,on him.,20
Mr HUNT,I would give him more credit,20
NA,"than that, because he came back and made some",20
NA,"rather irrational decisions. In a state of emotion,",20
NA,he sacked the Secretary to the Department of,20
NA,Primary Industry. If he had sacked the Minister,20
NA,"for Primary Industry he might have done justice,",20
NA,but he sacked the Secretary-he got rid of him.,20
NA,He did that to try to salve his conscience. I,20
NA,Using think his conscience was moved after he had,20
NA,spoken to the family and seen the distress in,20
NA,their eyes and the rather sad circumstances of,20
NA,their lives.,20
NA,Under this Government domestic product,20
NA,prices have remained frozen for four years. The,20
NA,industry will not forget that. In this legislation,20
NA,modest price rises have been achieved of about,20
NA,all 5 per cent for butter and 8 per cent for cheese.,20
NA,the Big deal! That is the only increase over a four-,20
NA,year period. But the industry is thankful for,20
NA,small mercies from this lot. The comfort or,20
NA,safety clause was fought all the way by the,20
NA,Government. The clause is designed to protect,20
NA,those States which will be net payers into an all-,20
NA,milk levy fund should sections of the industry,20
NA,attempt to trade manufacturing milk interstate,20
NA,on to liquid milk markets. As late as 25 Febru-,20
NA,"ary, the date of the Minister's so-called settle-",20
NA,"ment of negotiations on these Bills, he was still",20
NA,"kicking and squirming, although he refused to",20
NA,go personally into print. I quote from the Aus-,20
NA,tralian Financial Review of the following,20
NA,morning:,20
NA,Mr Kerin's spokesman-,21
NA,whoever that was-,21
NA,said that there were technical problems associated with,21
NA,"writing market protection into the legislation, because",21
NA,infringements of markets are hard to define legally.,21
NA,To that I say: What rot! All States support the,21
NA,inclusion of clause 6 in the Dairy Produce Levy,21
NA,(No. I) Bill. We can only speculate as to why,21
NA,the Minister reacted in such a negative manner,21
NA,to this request for a levy safeguard. This legis-,21
NA,lation has not obtained the full approval of the,21
NA,"industry but, under the circumstances, it has",21
NA,been accepted by the Dairy Farmers Federation,21
NA,as a compromise. The Opposition is not dissat-,21
NA,"isfied with the final outcome. Clearly, the Bills",21
NA,are preferable to the Minister's threat at one,21
NA,point to abandon all the legislation and let the,21
NA,industry crash. The benefit of the Opposition's,21
NA,actions can be summarised in these words: Some,21
NA,measure of stability and predictability.,21
NA,Mr Beddall-Unnecessarily delayed.,21
Mr HUNT,I think I covered that. I have,21
NA,said that if the Government's legislation had,21
NA,gone through both Houses last year the honour-,21
NA,able member for MCMillan ( Mr Cunningham),21
NA,would certainly not have been back in this Par-,21
NA,liament after the next election. There would,21
NA,have been a wholesale crisis in the Australian,21
NA,dairy industry. Farmers would have walked off,21
NA,their farms and workers would have walked out,21
NA,of the dairy factories. Jobs would have been lost,21
NA,and the sixth or seventh largest export industry,21
NA,in Australia would have been decimated. That,21
NA,was the way the Government would have treated,21
NA,"them, because they were farmers-because they",21
NA,were farmers and not members of the Australian,21
NA,Council of Trade Unions. The industry will now,21
NA,be better exposed to world markets. Producers,21
NA,will maintain a self-help arrangement to ensure,21
NA,that the oversupplied world product markets,21
NA,and corrupted world prices do not undermine,21
NA,the manufacturing or the product sector. Stabil-,21
NA,ity is likely to come through a levy on all milk,21
NA,which cannot exceed 45c per kilogram butter-,21
NA,fat. This will replace current stabilisation levies.,21
NA,"I would expect that the operative levy rate,",21
NA,to be struck next month by the Australian Dairy,21
NA,Corporation with advice from the Australian,21
NA,"Dairy Industry Advisory Council, to be in the",21
NA,"vicinity of 1.5 to 1.7c per litre, depending on the",21
NA,butterfat content. These levy proceeds are paid,21
NA,into a market support fund that will be distrib-,21
NA,uted by the Corporation on the basis of an,21
NA,assessed 30 per cent of the average export price,21
NA,for declared dairy produce over the coming year.,21
NA,"While this will give stability to the export sector,",21
NA,it also will introduce a new reward for initiative.,21
NA,The exporter will receive the 30 per cent pre-,21
NA,"mium-say, $750 a tonne of butter-on top of",21
NA,the world price. This is eminently sensible at a,21
NA,time when export markets have been saturated,21
NA,with dairy produce from other suppliers-pro-,21
NA,"duce which, in some cases, enjoys subsidies ex-",21
NA,ceeding 100 per cent. Europe alone holds some,21
NA,"100 million tonnes of butter in store, some of",21
NA,which is more than two years old.,21
NA,That brings me to the next point that I want,21
NA,"to raise, because I think that this legislation",21
NA,needs to be put in the context of what has,21
NA,happened in the last day. This morning I have,21
NA,been informed that there has been a sudden,21
NA,increase in the level of European payments for,21
NA,the export of cheese into the Japanese market.,21
NA,The Japanese market is Australia's most impor-,21
NA,tant export market. The increase in European,21
NA,payments will drop the price of cheese into the,21
NA,Japanese market by at least $100 a tonne. It is,21
NA,a change which will be of great concern to the,21
NA,"manufacturing side of the dairy industry and, I",21
NA,"am sure, of great concern to those manufactur-",21
NA,ing industries in Victoria. We are told that this,21
NA,has been done to compensate the Europeans for,21
NA,the exchange rate movements between European,21
NA,currencies and the Japanese yen that have oc-,21
NA,curred in recent months.,21
NA,Prior to this week the European subsidy on,21
NA,"10 lines of cheese-danbo, edam, fontal, fontina,",21
NA,gouda and a whole list of others-was running,21
NA,at 326 European currency units per tonne. This,21
NA,week the subsidy has leapt through the roof. For,21
NA,"those 10 lines of cheese, the export refund is",21
NA,now 774 ECUs per tonne. This represents an,21
NA,increase this week of 448 ECUs or 137 per cent.,21
NA,In Australian dollars the subsidy to the Europe-,21
NA,"ans has increased from $440 a tonne to $1,043",21
NA,"a tonne. For the crucial cheddar cheese line,",21
NA,which is the most important export line to Ja-,21
NA,"pan, the news is still worse. From Monday the",21
NA,refund to the Europeans has rocketed from 332,21
NA,to 905 ECUs per tonne. In Australian dollars,21
NA,"that is an increase from $435 a tonne to $1,221",21
NA,a tonne.,21
NA,Mr [an Robinson-Is that the success of the,21
NA,Prime Minister's visit?,21
Mr HUNT,It could well be. This is an in-,21
NA,crease in the restitution of 180 per cent. We,21
NA,cannot hope to compete against the devastating,21
NA,subsidies of other nations unless this Govern-,21
NA,ment acts immediately to get off the farmers',21
NA,"backs. It seems extraordinary, after the Prime",21
NA,Minister's recent visit to Europe and his meeting,21
NA,"with the European Economic Community, that",21
NA,we sho-ld have this devastating news that will,22
NA,have a very serious effect on the returns likely,22
NA,to be received by the manufacturing sector in,22
NA,this country.,22
NA,Mr Cunningham-How much has our cheese,22
NA,gone up in Japan in the past six months?,22
Mr HUNT,It will drop by at least $100 a,22
NA,tonne and that will have a very serious effect on,22
NA,the honourable member's industry in Victoria.,22
NA,So it is no laughing matter. If the honourable,22
NA,"member thinks it is a laughing matter, I suggest",22
NA,that he get in touch with the Australian Dairy,22
NA,Corporation and find out for himself how con-,22
NA,cerned it is. This week's news of the European,22
NA,attitude pours further cold water on suggestions,22
NA,of a breakthrough from the recent ministerial,22
NA,talks of the Prime Minister. The Government,22
NA,has made little progress in its negotiations with,22
NA,our trading partners.,22
NA,Instead of the Minister trying to be a smart,22
NA,ass and releasing the Opposition's discussion,22
NA,"per, as he did at the New South Wales Dairy",22
NA,Farmers' Association conference in Sydney the,22
NA,"day before yesterday, he would be wise to qui-",22
NA,etly read the policy points in that paper and to,22
NA,help the farmers by reducing the costs that the,22
NA,Government is imposing upon the inputs being,22
NA,used by farmers. I think it has backfired on him.,22
NA,I do not think I could ever have attracted the,22
NA,"sort of publicity for the policy that he has,",22
NA,because of the way in which he released it. The,22
NA,Minister said that the primary industry policy,22
NA,"fell off the back of a truck, but he launched it",22
NA,off the back of a truck to the media in Sydney.,22
NA,"He should not only launch it, but also read it",22
NA,and take from it to try to overcome some of the,22
NA,very serious problems confronting the farm sec-,22
NA,"tor, to reduce their costs of production, at least",22
NA,to help them become more competitive against,22
NA,the actions of the European Economic Commu-,22
NA,nity such as I have mentioned this morning. It,22
NA,is time that his Government took meaningful,22
NA,action to restore what it has taken away in,22
NA,Budgets and to alter the whole thrust of its,22
NA,"monetary, wages and tax policies and the way",22
NA,in which those policies are bringing great bur-,22
NA,dens of cost upon the agricultural sector. There,22
NA,is no other answer at the moment. The time for,22
NA,a lot of talk and nonsense has passed. What is,22
NA,needed now is action.,22
NA,I mention also that under the new arrange-,22
NA,ments that will be introduced under this legisla-,22
NA,tion further assistance will be given to the,22
NA,exporting sector of the industry. A 30 per cent,22
NA,premium will be paid over and above the world,22
NA,"price, which is established by a formula spelt",22
NA,out in the legislation. I believe that a degree of,22
NA,stability will be given to the manufacturing or,22
NA,dairy produce end of the industry in this legis-,22
NA,"lation, provided the Government takes the nec-",22
NA,essary decisions to help reduce the costs of the,22
NA,"industry in the production area and, secondly,",22
NA,continues very strong negotiations to try to bring,22
NA,about more rationality in the international trade,22
NA,area.,22
NA,I am pleased that the Commonwealth under-,22
NA,"writing is maintained, even if it is at 85 per cent",22
NA,instead of 90 per cent of the long term average,22
NA,export price. A separate new potholing mecha-,22
NA,nism will be funded by the industry through its,22
NA,Market Support Fund. The potholing comple-,22
NA,"ments underwriting in that, until now, the un-",22
NA,derwriting has been triggered only when the full,22
NA,year export returns have dropped below 90 per,22
NA,cent of a three-year average return. This has,22
NA,meant that severe but short term falls in export,22
NA,returns have not been compensated if the full,22
NA,pa- year average prices remained above the 90 per,22
NA,cent level. The potholing mechanism will effec-,22
NA,"tively counter short, sharp cuts to returns. Pay-",22
NA,ments from the Market Support Fund will be,22
NA,triggered if the export return temporarily falls,22
NA,below 85 per cent of the Bureau of Agricultural,22
NA,Economics' estimate of the long term average,22
NA,price.,22
NA,I note that the Minister has not specified,22
NA,operative rates for the four levies which will be,22
NA,struck under the new legislation. I understand,22
NA,that the operative rates will be struck early next,22
NA,"month, within the maximum rates of 45c per",22
NA,"kilogram butterfat for the market support fund,",22
NA,"5.5c for promotion, 2.5c for research and 2.5c",22
NA,towards the operation of the Australian Dairy,22
NA,Corporation. Several complaints have been lodged,22
NA,with me over the industry's decision to use but-,22
NA,terfat content rather than volume as the levy,22
NA,"base. Against these views, experience overseas",22
NA,has shown that milk can be de-watered in an,22
NA,effort to cut levy payments. As the Australian,22
NA,"Dairy Farmers Federation points out, it is logical",22
NA,that the levy should be imposed on the same,22
NA,units in which farmers are paid. There is growing,22
NA,support at a national industry level for a shift,22
NA,towards a levy base which combines milk-fat and,22
NA,proteins and which may prove to be the most,22
NA,equitable solution. I will be watching progress,22
NA,on this matter with interest.,22
NA,"In summary, these Bills are far better than",22
NA,those which the Minister sought to ram through,22
NA,the Parliament last year. It is both pleasing and,22
NA,gratifying that the actions taken by the Opposi-,22
NA,tion have resulted in more equity for this impor-,22
NA,tant industry. There can be no doubt that the,23
NA,Opposition has given dairy farmers new stability,23
NA,and predictability within their industry. This,23
NA,islation is a lesson to the Hawke Government.,23
NA,It cannot treat Australian farmers with con-,23
NA,"tempt, as it has in the past, and expect to escape",23
NA,the consequences.,23
NA,I turn briefly to the other main aspect of,23
NA,"Bills; that is, the changes to the Australian",23
NA,"Corporation. In short, the ADC is to be restruc-",23
NA,tured in line with reforms to the statutory mar-,23
NA,keting authorities as announced by the Minister,23
NA,on 29 January. On previous occasions in this,23
NA,place I have supported the general thrust of the,23
NA,"reforms, and I indicate now that the Opposition",23
NA,accepts the proposed changes to the Corpora-,23
NA,tion. The main question arising is whether the,23
NA,incoming Chairman should be a producer. Al-,23
NA,though I will not seek to move an amendment,23
NA,"on this matter, it would be helpful if the Minis-",23
NA,ter could indicate in his response that he will,23
NA,listen closely to the wishes of the industry and,23
NA,act accordingly. I note that the new selection,23
NA,committee will have four producer representa-,23
NA,"tives out of five, and I commend the Minister",23
NA,for that. A major breakthrough is the consulta-,23
NA,tive mechanism in the Bills whereby on impor-,23
NA,tant issues the Corporation will consult the,23
NA,Council of the Australian Dairy Industry Con-,23
NA,"ference. Again, this has been achieved largely",23
NA,through the strengthened hand of the industry,23
NA,as a result of the Opposition's actions.,23
NA,At this point it is appropriate that special,23
NA,"tribute be paid to the efforts of ADC Chairman,",23
NA,Mr Malcolm Vawser. His contribution over the,23
NA,past seven years has been nothing short of out-,23
NA,standing. Mr Vawser has demonstrated leader-,23
NA,ship and an effectiveness in his post for which,23
NA,all people engaged in the industry can be very,23
NA,grateful.,23
NA,It is relevant to look ahead to the future of,23
NA,our industry. There is no doubt that we must,23
NA,"retain a healthy, viable export component to",23
NA,take advantage of the inevitable growth in world,23
NA,markets. Many of our current problems have,23
NA,resulted from the subsidy policies of the EEC.,23
NA,There were. hopeful signs that the common,23
NA,agricultural policy was beginning to break down,23
NA,under its own weight and that world agriculture,23
NA,may come under the full provisions of the Gen-,23
NA,eral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Recent,23
NA,events make one wonder whether that will oc-,23
NA,"cur, but if it does occur Australian farmers must",23
NA,be positioned to take advantage of any world,23
NA,market recovery and any. relaxation in the im-,23
NA,pediments to world trade at the present time.,23
NA,Our best prospects in the immediate future lie,23
NA,with the markets in Asia and other regions out-,23
NA,legside Europe. Our products are of high quality,23
NA,and we are relatively close to half the world's,23
NA,population.,23
NA,"It is important, however, to monitor this leg-",23
NA,islation closely. We will be doing that with the,23
NA,these industry to make sure that the new marketing,23
NA,Dairy arrangements perform as we expect that they,23
NA,"should. Notwithstanding these words of caution,",23
NA,I am pleased to see a negotiated settlement to,23
NA,the dairy marketing issue after such a long and,23
NA,exhausting battle. I wish the Bills a speedy pas-,23
NA,sage and look forward to their enactment prior,23
NA,to the implementation date for many of the,23
NA,"provisions, I July.",23
Mr CUNNINGHAM ,MCMillan) (11.00)-1,23

NA,"duce Levy (No. I) Bill, the Dairy Produce Levy",23
NA,"(No.2) Bill, the Dairying Industry Research and",23
NA,"Promotion Levy (Termination of Levy) Bill, the",23
NA,Dairy Industry Stabilization Levy (Termination,23
NA,of Levy) Bill and the Dairy Legislation (Tran-,23

NA,"ments) Bill, which have been reintroduced by",23
NA,the Government following efforts in the last 12,23
NA,months to have them passed and having had,23
NA,them blocked in the Senate by the Opposition.,23
NA,We have just listened to the honourable member,23
NA,for Gwydir ( Mr Hunt) having a very long and,23
NA,drawn out speech on these Bills. He hardly,23
NA,touched on the real issues involved. The main,23
NA,and basic objective of the legislation is the de-,23
NA,velopment of a more efficient and profitable,23
NA,"dairy industry, an industry able .to respond",23
NA,quickly to changing market conditions and tech-,23
NA,nology. Only by achieving this objective can we,23
NA,maintain the largest possible Australian dairy,23
NA,industry that would be viable at an acceptable,23
NA,level of industry assistance.,23
NA,"On the domestic market, the industry must be",23
NA,able over time to defend its position on the basis,23
NA,of its competitiveness. Anyone who seeks to deny,23
NA,the fact of the closer economic relations agree-,23
NA,ment with New Zealand is putting his head in,23
NA,"the sand. On the export market, the industry",23
NA,must strive to exploit the most profitable mar-,23
NA,kets and minimise sales that are a net loss to,23
NA,Australia. How do we meet those objectives?,23
NA,"First, modification of present arrangements is",23
NA,sought so that producers and manufacturers can,23
NA,reap the benefits of their decisions. I refer to the,23
NA,replacement of current stabilisation arrange-,23
NA,ments with a uniform level of assistance for all,23
NA,"products, the financing of market support in the",23
NA,"least distortionary way by a levy on all milk, the",23
NA,reform of the Australian Dairy Corporation to,24
NA,upgrade its effectiveness-I notice that the hon-,24
NA,ourable member for Gwydir touched on that,24
NA,matter for about one minute although it is pos-,24
NA,sibly one of the main areas of support for the,24
NA,industry-the protection of local industry against,24
NA,"unfair import competition, the progressive re-",24
NA,duction in domestic price support to no higher,24
NA,than import parity with New Zealand and com-,24
NA,plementary measures which include increased,24
NA,government support for research marketing in-,24
NA,novation and adjustment.,24
NA,I would like to go back over a couple of those,24
NA,"points. I believe, and the Government believes,",24
NA,that the modification of the present arrange-,24
NA,ments so that producers and manufacturers can,24
NA,reap the benefits of their decisions is the main,24
NA,modification being sought by the Government,24
NA,"for the industry, one that should have been put",24
NA,in place many years ago. The industry has been,24
NA,bogged down in regulation-we could call it,24
NA,National Party agrarian-type socialism-under,24
NA,which all sorts of pooling systems were operat-,24
NA,"ing, levies were imposed for all sorts of reasons",24
NA,and there was cross-subsidisation to the point,24
NA,where the industry was completely stifled and,24
NA,factories had no initiative whatsoever to invest,24
NA,"in new machinery. Conglomerates, co-operatives",24
NA,and private industry grew to the point where,24
NA,"the total industry was in absolute chaos, produc-",24
NA,"ing products that nobody wanted, with no mar-",24
NA,keting and no sales.,24
NA,It was incumbent upon a government-and it,24
NA,took a Labor government to take the initiative-,24
NA,to put these things right. It is not that we are,24
NA,"introducing a lot of new legislation. In fact, we",24
NA,are pulling down a lot of the regulation that had,24
NA,been imposed by previous conservative govern-,24
NA,ments at the behest of the National Party. By,24
NA,pulling down those regulations we are able to,24
NA,"institute into the industry a lot of initiatives,",24
NA,new development and new technology. We have,24
NA,been able to create a situation whereby the in-,24
NA,dustry can really get behind the newly formed,24
NA,Australian Dairy Corporation. It will be able to,24
NA,advise that Corporation because of its new struc-,24
NA,"tures and go from strength to strength. Today,",24
NA,even 12 months after the announcement of the,24
NA,"Kerin scheme, we do not have piles of unwanted",24
NA,products sitting in store houses. This legislation,24
NA,will only put in place what the industry has,24
NA,been doing since last July and will carry out the,24
NA,very things that this Government and the indus-,24
NA,try believe should be done.,24
NA,The honourable member for Gwydir in his,24
NA,speech was clearly talking from the past and in,24
NA,the dark. The Victorian dairy industry is proba-,24
NA,bly the most progressive and efficient in Aus-,24
NA,tralia. It is the most geared to the market-place.,24
NA,"It is the biggest exporter, and the most efficient",24
NA,producer. The Victorian industry had to call a,24
NA,special conference last year to tell its leaders and,24
NA,the National Party that it wanted to support the,24
NA,Kerin-style proposals and to put them into op-,24
NA,eration. From that day we have seen the Na-,24
NA,tional Party and the Liberal Party decide that,24
NA,they had better come in behind what the Gov-,24
NA,ernment was doing and stop their procrastination.,24
NA,Let us look at some of the issues. Let us look,24
NA,at the market support arrangements. The do-,24
NA,mestic price structure will be supported princi-,24
NA,pally through market support payments on,24
NA,"exports of dairy produce. As we have said, these",24
NA,will be funded through the market support levy,24
NA,on fat in all milk. The rate of payment will,24
NA,normally be 30 per cent of the estimated average,24
NA,"export price for prescribed products; that is, the",24
NA,"major products. Also, a supplementary market",24
NA,support payment will be made on exports of,24
NA,dairy products. This will be funded by product,24
NA,levies on domestic sales of butter and cheese.,24
NA,These levies and consequent payments will de-,24
NA,cline in stages from I July 1987. The rate of,24
NA,supplementary payments for prescribed products,24
NA,will in most cases be a percentage of the esti-,24
NA,mated average export price. The Australian Dairy,24
NA,Corporation will determine prescribed and non-,24
NA,prescribed products and the rate of market sup-,24
NA,port payments for non-prescribed products. Pay-,24
NA,ments for non-prescribed products such as milk,24
NA,"and whey proteins, evaporated milk and baby",24
NA,powders are expected to be based on their con-,24
NA,"tent of milk fat and non-fat solids, that is, their",24
NA,protein content. Non-cheddar cheese exports are,24
NA,expected to receive payments equal to cheddar,24
NA,but adjusted for moisture content.,24
NA,There are new underwriting arrangements for,24
NA,the industry. The Government will continue to,24
NA,underwrite or guarantee returns from exports of,24
NA,major dairy products as it does under the present,24
NA,"arrangements for butter, butter oil, cheddar-type",24
NA,"cheeses, skim milk and buttermilk powder, cas-",24
NA,"ein and whole milk powder. However, the basis",24
NA,of underwriting will change from the present,24
NA,system of underwriting 90 per cent of the three-,24
NA,year average of export returns to a new system,24
NA,under which we will underwrite 85 per cent of,24
NA,the trend price. The trend price will be a value,24
NA,that the Bureau of Agricultural Economics esti-,24
NA,mates would have been obtained for the year if,24
NA,export prices were in their longer term trend,24
NA,"line, using actual export returns for the past",24
NA,seven years and the estimated average export,24
NA,price in the year of underwriting. Any govern-,25
NA,ment underwriting payments will be paid to the,25
NA,Market Support Fund. This new system will,25
NA,align with the potholing element of the market,25
NA,support arrangements and will assist the industry,25
NA,better than do current arrangements in the pres-,25
NA,ent international price cycle downturn.,25
NA,Another area that has been raised very strongly,25
NA,with the Government over a long time is domes-,25
NA,tic price support values; what we now call the,25
NA,DPSVs. In the dairy industry one has to get to,25
NA,know some of the abbreviations to understand,25
NA,what it is all about. We have had a lot of,25
NA,discussion in the past about the domestic value,25
NA,for levy purposes or DVLPs. Under the current,25
NA,"arrangements, the ones about which we have",25
NA,"been talking for the last two or three years,",25
NA,domestic prices are underpinned by stabilisation,25
NA,"levies on domestic sales which, together with the",25
NA,"assessed export prices, or AEPs, provide so-called",25
NA,"domestic values for levy purposes, with the levy",25
NA,being distributed over all sales to provide an,25
NA,"equalised return. Under the new arrangements,",25
NA,the domestic price support values for skim milk,25
NA,"powder, whole milk powder and casein will be",25
NA,"set by the sum of the average export price, the",25
NA,market support payment and the supplementary,25
NA,"market support payment, resulting in domestic",25
NA,price support values equal to or greater than the,25
NA,old DVLPs.,25
NA,"For butter and cheese, however, the sum of",25
NA,the average export price and the two market,25
NA,support payments is likely to be less than their,25
NA,current DVLPs and requires a product levy to,25
NA,reach a domestic price support value equal to,25
NA,the current DVLPs. The product levies for but-,25
NA,ter and cheese will be used to provide supple-,25
NA,mentary market support for exports of all dairy,25
NA,products. The cheese levy will be reduced on a,25
NA,six-monthly basis from 1 July 1987 to zero by,25
NA,1 July 1989. The butter levy will be reduced to,25
NA,half its initial rate by 1 July 1989 and will be,25
NA,reviewed in 1988-89. To help provide a smooth,25
NA,"transition to the new arrangements, the Govern-",25
NA,ment has agreed to set initial rates of product,25
NA,levies so that the new domestic price support,25
NA,values for butter and cheese will exceed the,25
NA,current DVLPs by 5 per cent and 8 per cent,25
NA,respectively.,25
NA,"In other words, the Government has agreed",25
NA,"that there should be a lift in the DVLPs, to use",25
NA,"the old terminology, of 5 per cent and 8 per",25
NA,cent respectively. The honourable member for,25
NA,Gwydir tried to take credit for that in his speech.,25
NA,He well knows that that will fall on deaf ears in,25
NA,"the dairy industry because, as far as the dairy",25
NA,"industry is concerned, the Opposition has op-",25
NA,posed this type of legislation all the way through.,25
NA,Even last year when the Victorian dairy industry,25
NA,"put its position very clearly, the Opposition came",25
NA,"back with what it called the Rowley plan, a plan",25
NA,which the National Party was pushing. The in-,25
NA,dustry could not agree to that plan and once,25
NA,again the Opposition had to go back and nego-,25
NA,tiate on the Kerin proposals. The Kerin propos-,25
NA,als are being discussed in the Parliament today,25
NA,and they are going to be in place by 1 July.,25
NA,It is good to hear that the honourable member,25
NA,"for Gwydir, on behalf of the Opposition, at last",25
NA,has conceded that the legislation will be benefi-,25
NA,cial to the industry and that the industry is,25
NA,already working to those proposals. I will use a,25
NA,few minutes of my speech later to detail some,25
NA,of the reasons why the industry is working so,25
NA,much better today. The matter of the levy being,25
NA,based on milk fat and not on volume was raised,25
NA,"with me, in particular, and with the task force",25
NA,of the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) that I have,25
NA,the privilege of chairing. I have been getting,25
NA,around Australia and talking to different indus-,25
NA,tries and that matter was raised with us while,25
NA,we were in Queensland. The reasons are quite,25
NA,clear. Most farmers at the moment are paid on,25
NA,"milk fat delivered. It is desirable, therefore, to",25
NA,align collections of the levies with milk fat rather,25
NA,"that with whole milk. Also, experience in Eu-",25
NA,rope with levies based on milk suggests that,25
NA,problems could arise due to milk being dehy-,25
NA,drated. That was also mentioned by the honour-,25
NA,able member for Gwydir. It is good to see that,25
NA,he does agree with us in that regard.,25
NA,"In future, the industry may move to a com-",25
NA,"positional system of payments, wherein farmers",25
NA,may be paid on milk fat and protein content-,25
NA,what is better known as solids non-fat. When,25
NA,that occurs the Government will consider basing,25
NA,levies on the compositional basis. We are quite,25
NA,happy to make the adjustment when the indus-,25
NA,try can come up with a better formula. Some of,25
NA,the other areas of great importance in the legis-,25
NA,lation relate to the Australian Dairy Corpora-,25
NA,"tion: Who will be in charge, who will advise the",25
NA,Dairy Corporation and how much control will,25
NA,the Government still have in this industry. They,25
NA,are vital issues. I believe we are taking steps in,25
NA,this regard which will put this industry into a,25
NA,position where it will be responsible for its own,25
NA,"future, it will be responsible for making its own",25
NA,decisions and it will be less reliant upon govern-,25
NA,ment direction. When I get around in my elec-,25
NA,torate-I have been to three meetings in the last,25
NA,four months in relation to the dairy industry-it,25
NA,"does surprise me that, in direct contrast to what",25
NA,was organised against us 12 months ago when,25
NA,the sides of cars were being kicked in by thugs,26
NA,when the Minister for Primary Industry ( Mr,26
NA,"Kerin) visited my area, I can now go to meetings",26
NA,in my area where the farmers are quite rational.,26
NA,"The farmers in Victoria, and I believe right",26
NA,"throughout Australia, have seen through the sort",26
NA,of proposals and the sort of campaign that was,26
NA,being waged 12 months ago and they are now,26
NA,quite clearly behind what the Government is,26
NA,doing. They are prepared to initiate the new,26
NA,initiatives.,26
NA,In my area and in the area of Gippsland,26
NA,people are now prepared to establish new cheese,26
NA,factories. Three factories have already been es-,26
NA,tablished since the Kerin plan was announced.,26
NA,Factories today are not producing those products,26
NA,which were based on levies and pooling before,26
NA,and which were sitting in storehouses. Factories,26
NA,"were getting paid to produce the product, paid",26
NA,again to reconstitute it and then paid to store,26
NA,at the farmers' expense. Farmers have woken up,26
NA,"to the National Party, in my area at least. I can",26
NA,guarantee that because I can attend a meeting,26
NA,anywhere in my electorate today and at those,26
NA,meetings have resolutions carried congratulating,26
NA,us on getting a job done and on getting it done,26
NA,well.,26
NA,"Finally, I move on to just a couple of points",26
NA,on the Australian Dairy Corporation and where,26
NA,the industry will fit into this in the future.,26
NA,executive council of the Australian Dairy Indus-,26
NA,try Conference has been recognised by the Gov-,26
NA,ernment as the peak industry council best able,26
NA,to provide industry policy advice to the Govern-,26
NA,ment and with which the Australian Dairy Cor-,26
NA,poration will consult on its activities. In other,26
NA,"words, the industry will have a very active part",26
NA,to play. The Australian Dairy Corporation will,26
NA,be required to consult with the council on the,26
NA,development of its corporate and operational,26
NA,plans and it will report annually to a meeting of,26
NA,the Australian Dairy Industry Conference on its,26
NA,operations. The council will also approve the,26
NA,scope of ADC trading activities and certain kinds,26
NA,of directions that the Australian Dairy Corpo-,26
NA,ration can make in regard to exports and will,26
NA,be consulted on the criteria that the Corpora-,26
NA,tions will use in directing exporters to consult,26
NA,with the Corporation on their export intentions.,26
NA,"In other words, factories and exporters will not",26
NA,be able to go ahead and produce products and,26
NA,then pass the economic effects of bad decision,26
NA,making across to somebody else and ask the,26
NA,farmers to pay for it in the long run.,26
NA,The legislation enables the council to make,26
NA,recommendations to the Government in respect,26
NA,of the rate to be prescribed for the Corporation,26
NA,levy which funds thl- Australian Dairy Corpora-,26
NA,"tion. Additionally, the council will also be able",26
NA,to make recommendations in respect of the pre-,26
NA,scribed rate of promotion and research levies.,26
NA,The restructuring of the Australian Dairy Cor-,26
NA,poration will be done by a selection committee,26
NA,which will comprise a presiding member chosen,26
NA,"and appointed by the Minister, and four mem-",26
NA,bers nominated by the executive council. The,26
NA,' council will also be able to express its non-,26
NA,"confidence in the Corporation, in which case the",26
NA,Minister is empowered to terminate the appoint-,26
NA,ment of one or more of the appointed members,26
NA,of the Corporation.,26
NA,"Expenditure from the dairy industry fund, ad-",26
NA,"ministered by the Australian Dairy Corporation,",26
NA,in most cases will be subject to ADIC approval.,26
NA,It is quite clear from the direction that the,26
NA,it Government is taking that the dairy industry in,26
NA,Australia can now look forward to developing,26
NA,itself and the industry into the next century. We,26
NA,have thrown off the shackles of the regulations,26
NA,imposed upon the industry for so many years-,26
NA,regulations which have restricted the industry,26
NA,and which have imposed costs upon the industry,26
NA,to the point where it was choking on its own,26
NA,performance. We are no longer witnessing in,26
NA,dairying areas four and five milk trucks driving,26
NA,"up and down the one road, burning up fuel and",26
NA,The destroying roads maintained by local govern-,26
NA,"ment, to pick up milk from the one dairy farmer",26
NA,simply because there was no rationalisation of,26
NA,that process. A lot of that milk was being taken,26
NA,to factories which were producing products far,26
NA,beyond the expected markets for those products.,26
NA,In my area there was the particular instance,26
NA,of two factories which in the last 12 months,26
NA,rationalised-one a proprietary and one a co-,26
NA,operative. We did not need to legislate for that,26
NA,to happen. The factories knew that was going to,26
NA,happen and they worked towards it. One partic-,26
NA,ular factory now picks up the milk in that area,26
NA,and that double cost of cartage is cut out. An-,26
NA,other factory ceased making butter as soon as,26
NA,the day arrived when it no longer had a profit-,26
NA,able market for that butter. It transferred the,26
NA,milk down the road to another factory which,26
NA,had very profitable products which were sold in,26
NA,the United States of America.,26
NA,These are the sorts of things that have hap-,26
NA,pened under the legislation proposed under the,26
NA,Kerin plan. We will have an industry which will,26
NA,be able to compete with the New Zealand in-,26
NA,dustry under our closer economic relations pol-,26
NA,icy. We will not be a target now for New Zealand,26
NA,in the manufacturing sector of Australia. Our,27
NA,industry in Victoria will not have to worry to,27
NA,"the point where under the old proposals, as costs",27
NA,"and prices increased, it was pushed into a very",27
NA,poor marketing situation and its markets in Aus-,27
NA,"tralia-Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane-were",27
NA,becoming clear targets for the New Zealanders,27
NA,who were able to produce in a more efficient,27
NA,manner. We now have a similar system to New,27
NA,Zealand. We are competitive and I believe that,27
NA,this legislation will put the Australian dairy in-,27
NA,dustry into a very healthy position in the future,27
NA,and it will start to restore some of the confidence,27
NA,in the parts of rural Australia where it is badly,27
NA,needed. I strongly support the legislation.,27
Mr DRUMMOND ,Forrest) (11.19)-A lot,27
NA,of what the honourable member for MCMillan,27
NA,( Mr Cunningham) said in the early part of his,27
NA,address was quite true and accurate. The indus-,27
NA,"try has fallen into some degree of chaos, partic-",27
NA,"ularly in Victoria, I suggest, and maybe to a",27
NA,"lesser extent in Tasmania, but for him to lay",27
NA,that on previous Federal governments is a bit,27
NA,unfair. There are some areas in Australia where,27
NA,the dairy industry is not in chaos and is enjoying,27
NA,a fairly prosperous period. I refer to the industry,27
NA,in Western Australia. What has been the differ-,27
NA,ence between Western Australia and Victoria?,27
NA,Why has this occurred? It occurred because at,27
NA,least 10 years ago Western Australia made a,27
NA,deliberate effort to rationalises its industry. In,27
NA,Western Australia there is a three-price scheme,27
NA,and everyone has a share of these different prices.,27
NA,It is an entitlement or quota scheme. We have a,27
NA,"price for our liquid milk, we have a price for",27
NA,"out white milk products, and then we have an",27
NA,end price. People can produce as much as they,27
NA,"want but, as a true indication of what that milk",27
NA,"is worth, since there is no domestic market for",27
NA,it it gets a return of something like 5c to 10c a,27
NA,litre because that is the least one would expect,27
NA,on the export market. So production in Western,27
NA,Australia has been limited to profitable areas of,27
NA,return.,27
NA,It might have been a good idea if many years,27
NA,ago New South Wales and Victoria has got to-,27
NA,gether. It might be one of the frailties of our,27
NA,State systems; we have two completely different,27
NA,dairy industries. Each is a child of the State. We,27
NA,have a one-price system in Victoria where the,27
NA,production has not been limited. The return has,27
NA,"been equalised between all products, whether for",27
NA,"the liquid milk market, the domestic manufac-",27
NA,"turing market, or the export market. So what",27
NA,has happened in Victoria? We have increasing,27
NA,"production and, of course, diminishing prices as",27
NA,world markets have collapsed. I will return to,27
NA,the Western Australian position in a minute.,27
NA,I am fearful of this legislation. I appreciate,27
NA,that the industry throughout Australia and the,27
NA,Government have finally come to a compromise,27
NA,agreement on the way we should go. The com-,27
NA,promise has been reached because of the diffi-,27
NA,culties of the industry being able to get together.,27
NA,It comprises five or six industries throughout,27
NA,"Australia, and I briefly described the Western",27
NA,Australian and Victorian industries. It is a com-,27
NA,promise position. I am fearful of this legislation,27
NA,"because, quite frankly, I believe that the very",27
NA,"basis of it, which aims to tie the Australian",27
NA,"domestic prices to world traded prices, is wrong.",27
NA,There is no such thing as a world traded price.,27
NA,Maybe we can try to relate it to New Zealand's,27
NA,"export price, but that is not a true price because",27
NA,it is controlled by the Brussels price. There is no,27
NA,dairy products futures trading or commodities,27
NA,"trading on international markets, in the way",27
NA,"wheat, grain, metal or anything else is traded.",27
NA,There is no such thing because it is a corrupt,27
NA,market. That situation developed because na-,27
NA,tions such as those in the European Economic,27
NA,Community and the United States of America-,27
NA,"in fact almost every nation in the world, includ-",27
NA,"ing Australia-wished to be self-sufficient, par-",27
NA,ticularly in all forms of dairy products. This has,27
NA,"led to a remarkable self-sufficiency in the EEC,",27
NA,but in its rush to become self-sufficient it has,27
NA,ended up with quite a surplus.,27
NA,Only about 4 per cent of all dairy products,27
NA,produced in the world today are actually traded.,27
NA,"Other than in New Zealand and Australia, which",27
NA,have been fairly great exporting nations in dairy,27
NA,"products over the years, dairy products are traded",27
NA,because people want to get rid of their surplus.,27
NA,We have a situation where the big producers in,27
NA,the European Economic Community overprod-,27
NA,"uce by about 2 or 3 per cent, which is a tremen-",27
NA,"dous volume. In fact, that 2 or 3 per cent is as",27
NA,much as Australia and New Zealand produce all,27
NA,"up-not what they export, what they produce.",27
NA,Those nations do not mind what price they get,27
NA,for their product. They do not care; it is not,27
NA,essential. They just want to get rid of that prod-,27
NA,uct. So at no time is the price of that product,27
NA,tied to a real price. Consumers in Australia pay,27
NA,for their dairy product something like 60 per,27
NA,cent of what the consumers in the EEC and,27
NA,America pay for their product. Our consumers,27
NA,are getting a reasonably cheap product. As the,27
NA,honourable member for Gwydir ( Mr Hunt) has,27
NA,"mentioned, milk is a nutritious product and one",27
NA,could live longer on it than on any other sub-,27
NA,stance if that was the only thing one had. It is,27
NA,"far cheaper than coke, beer, or anything else,",28
NA,and the manufacturers do not have to go through,28
NA,the machinations of the milk industry to produce,28
NA,"the product. We have to have a cow in the field,",28
NA,"we have to get the milk out of the cow, and the",28
NA,milk has to go to the factory. To produce a,28
NA,"bottle of coke, there is a factory somewhere, a",28
NA,"bottle is filled with water, a bit of something",28
NA,"else is poured into it, and there it is. Yet it",28
NA,lot more expensive than milk.,28
NA,"The consumers of the EEC, America and the",28
NA,other exporting nations with which we have to,28
NA,compete-it is not just New Zealand-are pay-,28
NA,ing at least 40 per cent more for their dairy,28
NA,product than Australian consumers are. Yet we,28
NA,are saying that we have to tie our industry to,28
NA,the world traded price of their surplus. Why do,28
NA,"we not tie our price, as is normal with most",28
NA,"cases of dumping, to what is reasonable for those",28
NA,consumers to pay in their country? The main,28
NA,reason why we have a regulated industry is to,28
NA,"see that people have fresh milk every day, all",28
NA,"year round, and at a reasonable price. It is not",28
NA,for the protection of the dairy farmer.,28
NA,The concept of building this efficient and prof-,28
NA,"itable industry, as the Minister for Primary In-",28
NA,"dustry ( Mr Kerin) said in his speech, around",28
NA,world traded prices of dairy products is just a,28
NA,"nonsense. No longer will we have pooling, no",28
NA,longer will we have allowances. I agree that a,28
NA,"lot of those things had to be tidied up, but it",28
NA,will surely lead to a situation where the export-,28
NA,ers will find it very difficult to get a reasonable,28
NA,price because he will not have the capacity to,28
NA,wait for a sale. I believe production in Australia,28
NA,will increase in the short term because there will,28
NA,be no clear market signals to the producer. Re-,28
NA,member that we have to get a General Agree-,28
NA,ment on Tariffs and Trade minimum price-we,28
NA,are a party to GATT. Exporters will find it,28
NA,increasingly difficult to get a reasonable price,28
NA,and they will naturally look to our domestic,28
NA,market. If this happens we will see the under-,28
NA,"cutting of the price of butter, cheese and so on,",28
NA,and that is probably what the Government wishes,28
NA,to achieve.,28
NA,Mr Cowan-Western Australia has always,28
NA,looked after the market there.,28
Mr DRUMMOND,That is true. As the hon-,28
NA,"ourable member for Gwydir said earlier, it really",28
NA,is consumer legislation. Undercutting will start,28
NA,in the domestic market because there will be no,28
NA,allowances and no pooling. What will a factory,28
NA,do? It will have to get into the international,28
NA,"market-place to try to undercut, which will lead",28
NA,to lots of bad blood with New Zealand. If the,28
NA,factory cannot sell its product it will have to,28
NA,look to the internal market.,28
NA,Those are the broad concerns I have about,28
NA,the legislation and the way in which the dairy,28
NA,industry is expected to go. I also make the point,28
NA,that if world prices continue to move down or,28
NA,collapse over a period-I understand that the,28
NA,is a legislation covers the underwriting-the 130 per,28
NA,cent of world trade prices becomes a lesser figure,28
NA,and therefore the all-milk levy becomes less. For,28
NA,"instance, the levy was estimated to be 1.8c per",28
NA,litre in January 1986 with GATT minimum,28
NA,holdings and the dollar at 70c. With the Euro-,28
NA,pean Economic Community selling under GATT,28
NA,"price and with the Australian dollar at US74c,",28
NA,the levy will be under 1.3c. So as the interna-,28
NA,"tional export markets decrease, so will the levy",28
NA,and so will the assistance to exporters.,28
NA,I turn briefly to the position of Western Aus-,28
NA,tralia. My State has never been an exporter of,28
NA,"dairy products, but many years ago it made a",28
NA,deliberate attempt to put its own industry in,28
NA,"order. It introduced a scheme, which it has mod-",28
NA,"ified over the years, whereby every dairy farmer",28
NA,participates and has a quota of liquid milk for,28
NA,local consumption and a quota for whitegood,28
NA,products. His return for the milk he has left-,28
NA,and he can produce all he wants to-reflects the,28
NA,true market export price. We have never been a,28
NA,"burden to the eastern States. In fact, we are an",28
NA,importer of eastern States' products. We import,28
NA,"something like 70 to 80 per cent of our butter,",28
NA,cheese and other manufactured dairy products.,28
NA,The Western Australian farmers are finding it,28
NA,"very difficult to understand why they, having",28
NA,"put their house in order, will be required under",28
NA,this legislation to give to their eastern States,28
NA,"cousins some $4,500 per farm. That is what the",28
NA,net cost of the levy will be to the average farm,28
NA,in Western Australia.,28
NA,Because the Western Australian dairy indus-,28
NA,"try's record, because of its isolation and because",28
NA,it has never been a burden on the Australian,28
NA,"dairy industry or the Australian community, I",28
NA,plead that it be given special consideration. I,28
NA,think that it would be possible and reasonable,28
NA,to establish a special mechanism whereby an,28
NA,amount of money equivalent to the levy col-,28
NA,lected could be returned to Western Australia. I,28
NA,do not think there is any sound economic reason,28
NA,for Western Australia to accept this plan. How-,28
NA,"ever, we agree that it is a national plan and that",28
NA,we cannot just chop one State out of it. The,28
NA,moneys raised in Western Australia should be,28
NA,returned to Western Australia. Clause 94 of the,28
NA,Dairy Produce Bill deals with market support,28
NA,"payments, but another section could be added to",29
NA,in order to recognise the need to make a disabil-,29
NA,ity payment if a State is disadvantaged.,29
NA,"Given our location, any significant reduction",29
NA,in the production of milk in Western Australia,29
NA,could jeopardise the continued availability of,29
NA,fresh milk and short life products to consumers,29
NA,throughout Western Australia. As honourable,29
NA,"members know, Western Australia is a long way",29
NA,from the eastern States. It is isolated from the,29
NA,rest of Australia and is not contributing to the,29
NA,national dairy marketing problems. The prices,29
NA,"of all milk and cream products, including long",29
NA,"life products, entering Western Australia for sale",29
NA,would appropriately reflect retail prices for those,29
NA,products in their State of origin. This legislation,29
NA,should contain a mechanism to allow the State,29
NA,"Minister to suspend arrangements if, in his opin-",29
NA,"ion, milk or cream were dumped in Western",29
NA,Australia.,29
NA,I am sure that the Opposition would have put,29
NA,before the Parliament an amendment such as I,29
NA,"have suggested. However, understanding that the",29
NA,Minister had said that there was no way he,29
NA,"would accept any amendments to the legislation,",29
NA,the Opposition felt reluctant to do so. I under-,29
NA,stand that the Minister has received very strong,29
NA,"representations from Western Australia, partic-",29
NA,ularly from the Western Australian Govern-,29
NA,"ment, which is of his political complexion. I ask",29
NA,"him whether he would consider, even at this late",29
NA,"stage, introducing such an amendment to this",29
NA,Bill in the interests of equity for the producers,29
NA,of Western Australia. I guess it would really be,29
NA,in the interests of the consumers of Western,29
NA,"Australia, because there is no way that produc-",29
NA,ers in Western Australia can stand this imposi-,29
NA,tion and they will seek a rise in the price of,29
NA,"liquid milk. As a result, the consumers of West-",29
NA,ern Australia will be paying this levy to farmers,29
NA,"in Victoria, who claim that they are the most",29
NA,efficient in Australia.,29
Mr BEDDALL ,Rankin) (11.35)-1t is with,29
NA,great pleasure that I rise to support these long,29
NA,overdue Bills introduced by my colleague the,29
NA,Minister for Primary Industry ( Mr Kerin). It,29
NA,will come as no surprise to anybody who has,29
NA,followed the dairy industry debate that these,29
NA,Bills represent the most comprehensive changes,29
NA,to the Australian dairy industry ever undertaken,29
NA,by a Federal government. After years of neglect,29
NA,"by the National and Liberal parties, the Austra-",29
NA,lian dairy industry had reached the position where,29
NA,the industry faced total collapse. The prospect,29
NA,of interstate trade wars was almost a reality and,29
NA,the industry itself was bitterly divided.,29
NA,When the Minister sought to bring about,29
NA,changes to the dairy industry over 12 months,29
NA,"ago, he met with massive resistance from those",29
NA,sections of the industry with a vested interest.,29
NA,These vested interests had manoeuvred them-,29
NA,selves into positions of influence in the industry's,29
NA,peak councils. They convinced the Australian,29
NA,Democrats in the Senate that the original Kerin,29
NA,plan did not have the support of the dairy in-,29
NA,dustry and the initial legislation was rejected.,29
NA,These vested interests made the claim that they,29
NA,could come up with a far better dairy industry,29
NA,"plan, and so the Government agreed to listen to",29
NA,their proposals. It is now a matter of history,29
NA,that the so-called Rowley plan has been con-,29
NA,"signed to the scrap-heap, as it should have been.",29
NA,The Rowley plan would have benefited only the,29
NA,large producers with financial resources far above,29
NA,those of the ordinary family dairy farmer. This,29
NA,"plan, which was thankfully rejected by the in-",29
NA,"dustry, was based on rolling entitlements that",29
NA,would have enabled the privileged dairy farmers,29
NA,of the Australian industry to keep over-produc-,29
NA,ing so that the extra production could be allo-,29
NA,cated as entitlement at the end of each year.,29
NA,"Therefore, after three years the entitlement would",29
NA,have been assessed not on realistic levels of,29
NA,production but on the increased production that,29
NA,had been financed from other sources.,29
NA,There are seven major elements of this legis-,29
NA,lation: A cessation of export pooling; replace-,29
NA,ment of current stabilisation arrangements;,29
NA,market support arrangements; progressive reduc-,29
NA,tion in domestic price support; protection of the,29
NA,local industry against unfair import competition;,29
NA,upgrading of the Australian Dairy Corporation,29
NA,to enhance its effectiveness and accountability;,29
NA,and special assistance for market innovation and,29
NA,research. There are many vital elements to this,29
NA,"Bill, perhaps none more important than the re-",29
NA,form of the Australian Dairy Corporation. As I,29
NA,have moved around my electorate of Rankin,29
NA,"talking to dairy farmers and dairy co-operatives,",29
NA,I have encountered a great deal of criticism of,29
NA,the current Australian Dairy Corporation. It has,29
NA,been regarded by the industry as ineffectual in,29
NA,promoting Australian dairy products on the world,29
NA,market. A much enhanced Australian Dairy,29
NA,Corporation will be able to seek out world mar-,29
NA,"kets. If the dairy industry is to survive, it must",29
NA,be aggressive on world markets despite the un-,29
NA,fair practices it will encounter from our compet-,29
NA,itors. It cannot sit back in the hope that,29
NA,Australian dairy products will sell themselves.,29
NA,The other major item which has raised most,29
NA,controversy in relation to this legislation has,29
NA,been the all milk levy that will be used to,29
NA,underwrite the export market. The market sup-,30
NA,port fund will be financed from the dairy prod-,30
NA,uct levy which will apply to all milk produced,30
NA,on or after 1 July 1986. Under the new levy,30
NA,"arrangements, the amount of levy payable by a",30
NA,producer will depend on the amount of milk fat,30
NA,contained in his milk. Under current arrange-,30
NA,"ments, where a producer delivers whole milk to",30
NA,"a processor, the levy is calculated at a rate per",30
NA,litre regardless of fat content; only where the,30
NA,producer delivers cream is the levy to be based,30
NA,on fat content. The change to a standard milk,30
NA,fat basis arises from a decision to base the,30
NA,ket support levy on milk fat and the desirability,30
NA,of having a standard base for all levies on milk.,30
NA,The Bill provides a clause to cover the situation,30
NA,where it has not been possible to ascertain the,30
NA,milk fat content. This clause should only have,30
NA,to be resorted to for a small proportion of Aus-,30
NA,tralian production since most milk payment sys-,30
NA,tems require the recording of milk fat content.,30
NA,The Bill specifies maximum rates for all milk,30
NA,fat levies with the operative rates to be set by,30
NA,"regulation. For market support levy, the maxi-",30
NA,mum rate of levy is to be 45c per kilogram of,30
NA,"milk fat, which is equivalent to 2c per litre for",30
NA,milk of average fat content. In the case of the,30
NA,"research levy, the maximum rate specified cor-",30
NA,responds to the maximum rate of 2.5c recently,30
NA,set in the Dairying Industry Research and Pro-,30
NA,motion Levy Amendment Act 1986. The maxi-,30
NA,mum rates for the promotion and corporation,30
NA,levies are respectively 5.5c per kilogram fat and,30
NA,2.5c per kilogram fat.,30
NA,I could not address myself to any dairy legis-,30
NA,lation before this House without some comment,30
NA,on the mismanagement of the industry in my,30
NA,own State by the scandal-ridden National Party,30
NA,Government led by an irrelevant aging premier.,30
NA,The dairy industry in Queensland has suffered,30
NA,the worst effects of political patronage. The,30
NA,Coast Mafia of the National Party has 80 per,30
NA,cent of the market milk whereas the poor strug-,30
NA,gling farmers supplying the Warwick Co-opera-,30
NA,tive in my electorate of Rankin are lucky to,30
NA,reach 40 per cent. In previous speeches in this,30
NA,Parliament I have fully documented the types of,30
NA,scandals that have existed in Queensland under,30
NA,the National Party State Government.,30
NA,The Minister and his Department might be,30
NA,interested in investigating the case of the Gold,30
NA,Coast Dairy Co-operative run by a Mr Hollin-,30
NA,"dale, who is a close personal friend of the",30
NA,"Queensland Minister for Local Government,",30
NA,"Main Roads and Racing, Mr Hinze. On 3 Sep-",30
NA,"tember 1985 the State member for Archerfield,",30
NA,"Mr Henry Palaszczuk, stated that the Gold Coast",30
NA,Dairy had avoided paying its correct amount of,30
NA,levy on dairy products to the Commonwealth.,30
NA,The story has not been denied by the State,30
NA,"Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Turner, so I",30
NA,shall outline it for the Minister. The Gold Coast,30
NA,Dairy produces about 500 tonnes of skim milk,30
NA,"powder which, in the 1984-85 financial year,",30
NA,attracted a levy of $474 a tonne. Over a 12-,30
NA,"month period the levy totalled $237,000. If the",30
NA,dairy's failure to pay its levy has been going on,30
NA,"for a number of years, the Commonwe.alth could",30
NA,mar- be owed as much as $lm. I believe that the,30
NA,Minister should investigate these allegations.,30
NA,One of the few favoured co-operatives in,30
NA,"Queensland, the Gold Coast Dairy has recently",30
NA,ensured the closure of a small country co-oper-,30
NA,ative in nearby Beaudesert. There is a stench,30
NA,about the Gold Coast Dairy. Its leading players,30
NA,and suppliers go to the very heart of the Queens-,30
NA,land National Party hierarchy. The Minister will,30
NA,be doing us a favour if he ensures that the Gold,30
NA,Coast Dairy is paying its correct amount on,30
NA,"leviable product, particularly under this legisla-",30
NA,tion. Levies appear to be the core of the problem,30
NA,in the dairy industry today. Farmers in Warwick,30
NA,in my electorate and in Beaudesert would be,30
NA,advantaged by the maximum 2c per litre all milk,30
NA,levy as proposed by the Minister's plan. I am,30
NA,reliably informed from sources within the indus-,30
NA,try that up to 60 per cent of farmers pay no,30
NA,milk levy at all.,30
NA,I turn now to the Dairying Industry Research,30
NA,and Promotion Levy (Termination of Levy) Bill.,30
NA,I ask the Minister to give me an assurance that,30
NA,this money will be correctly audited each year.,30
NA,I do so because of the situation within the,30
NA,Queensland Dairymen's Organisation in which,30
NA,"cheques of up to $500,000 are alleged to have",30
NA,been misappropriated. Every dairy farmer in,30
NA,Gold Queensland has to belong to the Queensland,30
NA,Dairymen's Organisation. Apparently the Na-,30
NA,tional Party is against compulsory unionism ex-,30
NA,cept where it applies in the dairy industry. Each,30
NA,dairyman pays $85 a year to belong and there,30
NA,"are 2,500 Queensland dairymen, so the extent of",30
NA,the apparent irregularities will not escape the,30
NA,Minister. I find the incident amazing because the,30
NA,"accounts should have been audited yearly and,",30
NA,"surely, the cheques were countersigned by the",30
NA,chairman or a senior executive member. If not,30
NA,the Minister should ask: Why not? Just as the,30
NA,Queensland dairymen need to be reassured about,30
NA,the accounting procedures in their own organi-,30
NA,"sation, I am sure that the Queensland dairymen",30
NA,will want to be assured that government money,30
NA,targeted for research in the industry actually,30
NA,ends up there. Many Queensland dairymen be-,31
NA,lieve that their hard won $85 is little more than,31
NA,a campaign contribution to the National Party.,31
NA,"Their newsletter, Queensland Dairy Farmers,",31
NA,makes no honest attempt at impartiality. Any,31
NA,observer would have thought that an industry,31
NA,suffering as much injustice as the Queensland,31
NA,dairy industry would be pressing the State Gov-,31
NA,"ernment for much needed reform. Instead, all",31
NA,the vitriol is reserved for this Government and,31
NA,this Minister.,31
NA,These Bills are designed to give the industry a,31
NA,better support mechanism. I am certain that,31
NA,they will achieve that. I particularly welcome,31
NA,the abolition of the allowances which have ena-,31
NA,bled Victorian manufacturers to sell butter in,31
NA,Queensland more cheaply than in Victoria. My,31
NA,producers on the southern Darling Downs will,31
NA,"eagerly welcome that proposal. It is, neverthe-",31
NA,"less, a reality that, in spite of all the assistance,",31
NA,farmers will still leave the industry. The Govern-,31
NA,ment has done a great deal in the rural recon-,31
NA,struction scheme and the rural adjustment scheme,31
NA,to ensure that financially hard-pressed farmers,31
NA,"are cared for. In Queensland, because of the",31
NA,"generosity of the Federal Government, almost",31
NA,$38.824m has been accumulated in these two,31
NA,"funds. Unfortunately, on its own budget esti-",31
NA,"mates, the Queensland National Party Govern-",31
NA,ment plans to receive $29.7l8m from farmers,31
NA,and is expected to spend only $32.48m. In real-,31
NA,"ity, the Queensland Government will only dip",31
NA,into its massive accumulations by $2.763m.,31
NA,It is time the Queensland Government emp-,31
NA,tied out these hollowed logs and tried to give,31
NA,genuine assistance to Queensland farmers. The,31
NA,figures show that the Queensland Government is,31
NA,profiteering while farmers go to the wall. These,31
NA,actions contrast with the rural policies of this,31
NA,Government. Our concern is for the efficient,31
NA,management of rural industries. I support the,31
NA,Minister in these Bills and hope the Opposition,31
NA,will distance itself from its Queensland col-,31
NA,leagues and do something for all dairy farmers,31
NA,and not just the favoured few.,31
Mr MILES ,Braddon) (11.45)-One is,31
NA,amazed that such important legislation for the,31
NA,dairy farmers of Australia is being guillotined,31
NA,through this House today. One comes into the,31
NA,House and hears the honourable member for,31
NA,MCMillan ( Mr Cunningham) say: 'It took a La-,31
NA,bor government to initiate these changes'. That,31
NA,is absolute rubbish. It is the industry which ini-,31
NA,tiates these changes and they would not have,31
NA,occurred had the Opposition not opposed the,31
NA,measures in the Senate in 1985. The honourable,31
NA,member for Rankin ( Mr Beddall) said that this,31
NA,is the most comprehensive change ever made by,31
NA,a Federal government. It is absolutely incredible,31
NA,when governments laud themselves and it is really,31
NA,the industry which comes up with the initiatives,31
NA,and ideas to restructure its plan. The Govern-,31
NA,ment wants to heap praise on itself whereas in,31
NA,actual fact the ideas and creativity come from,31
NA,other people.,31
NA,Mr Ian Robinson-The Kerin plan was,31
NA,rejected.,31
Mr MILES,That is right. As the honourable,31
NA,"member says, the Kerin plan was rejected out-",31
NA,"right by the farmers of Australia. Today six Bills,",31
NA,"the Dairy Produce Bill, the Dairy Produce Levy",31
NA,"(No.1) Bill, the Dairy Produce Levy (No.2)",31
NA,"Bill, the Dairying Industry Research and Pro-",31
NA,"motion Levy (Termination of Levy) Bill, the",31
NA,Dairy Industry Stabilization Levy (Termination,31
NA,of Levy) Bill and the Dairy Legislation (Tran-,31
NA,sitional Provisions and Consequential Amend-,31
NA,"ments) Bill, are before the House. They are",31
NA,designed to implement new marketing arrange-,31
NA,ments for the Australian dairy industry and to,31
NA,alter the structure and functions of the Austra-,31
NA,lian Dairy Corporation. They will replace the,31
NA,legislation brought before this House in May last,31
NA,year and amended in the Senate. Because the,31
NA,Opposition opposed the legislation that would,31
NA,have had a severe fall-out effect on the dairy,31
NA,"industry and its families, the Government has",31
NA,now modified its legislation. Although a safety,31
NA,clause has been inserted and the outstanding,31
NA,matter of an increase in price of certain manu-,31
NA,factured products has been overcome to the sat-,31
NA,isfaction of the Australian Dairy Farmers,31
NA,"Federation, the legislation has no satisfactory",31
NA,mechanism to reduce the production of milk.,31
NA,Such a mechanism was regarded by many in the,31
NA,industry to be a necessary step towards placing,31
NA,the industry on a more stable footing with better,31
NA,long term prospects.,31
NA,The dairy industry in Australia has undergone,31
NA,an enormous rationalisation in recent years. In,31
NA,the last 20 years the number of dairy farms has,31
NA,"declined by 73 per cent, from 49,000 in 1964 to",31
NA,"an estimated 18,300 in 1985. Direct employment",31
NA,has fallen by over 60 per cent in the last 30,31
NA,years and the number of factories has declined,31
NA,by over 30 per cent in the last 10 years. Yet this,31
NA,industry continues to be a vibrant one that earns,31
NA,in excess of $350m in exports and the value of,31
NA,total dairy production exceeds $1 billion per,31
NA,annum. Due to the nature of the products of,31
NA,"the industry, it remains a State based industry",31
NA,that has focused its attention on the fresh milk,31
NA,markets of the more populous areas of each,32
NA,State.,32
NA,The industry can be divided into two sectors-,32
NA,the liquid fresh milk market and the manufac-,32
NA,turing market. The historical development of the,32
NA,industry that has been controlled by the States,32
NA,has meant that Victoria and Tasmania manufac-,32
NA,ture by far the majority of their milk whilst,32
NA,States such as New South Wales and Western,32
NA,Australia manufacture less than 50 per cent of,32
NA,their milk. Thus the burden of lower returns,32
NA,from the manufactured milk sector has previ-,32
NA,ously fallen more heavily on Victorian and Tas-,32
NA,manian farmers than on farmers in other States.,32
NA,"However, it is the manufactured products such",32
NA,"as cheese, butter, casein and milk powder that",32
NA,earn the export dollar that is so vital to Aus-,32
NA,"tralia, particularly when our trade balance is in",32
NA,the red to the tune of $1.5 billion.,32
NA,This legislation will place a financial burden,32
NA,on the producers of New South Wales and West-,32
NA,"ern Australia in particular, and that raises an",32
NA,important principle that governments of all,32
NA,"shades and colours should give credence to, that",32
NA,"is, where an industry is to be restructured for",32
NA,the overall benefit of the nation those areas,32
NA,are disadvantaged by the restructuring should,32
NA,have available to them resources that would,32
NA,minimise the dislocation and social upheaval in,32
NA,families that may be caused by such restructur-,32
NA,ing. The overwhelming majority of Australians,32
NA,accept that Australia has a major task ahead of,32
NA,it to restructure its economic base so that it is,32
NA,more competitive in world markets. Although,32
NA,the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Howard) has,32
NA,been constantly pointing to the practical meas-,32
NA,ures that would lead the economy in the right,32
NA,"direction, it was only last week that the Austra-",32
NA,lian Labor Party gave even any semblance of,32
NA,recognition that a problem existed. The Treas-,32
NA,urer ( Mr Keating) then used irresponsibly col-,32
NA,"ourful language, saying that Australia was",32
NA,heading towards being a banana republic. The,32
NA,dairy industry most likely would not be in need,32
NA,of Federal Government intervention if Australia,32
NA,had remained competitive in the world market,32
NA,for dairy products.,32
NA,We cannot place all the blame on the cor-,32
NA,rupted policies of the European Community.,32
NA,Some of the difficulties of this industry can be,32
NA,laid squarely at the feet of the Government's,32
NA,policies. How can this Government have the gall,32
NA,"to burden farmers with a capital gains tax, which",32
NA,"was introduced into this House last night, at a",32
NA,time when they are already experiencing severe,32
NA,financial hardships? This Government has shown,32
NA,little concern for the productive sector of the,32
NA,economy. Dairy farmers are skilled operators,32
NA,who cope with a tedium of routine that many,32
NA,Australians have rejected. Yet it is these people,32
NA,who are at the base of Australia's wealth-creat-,32
NA,ing export commodities.,32
NA,In this area I commend the industry initiative,32
NA,of an all-milk levy that is designed to support,32
NA,returns to producers who sell to the lower priced,32
NA,manufacturing markets. That is where we earn,32
NA,our export income. There is no funding from the,32
NA,"Commonwealth for this initiative. It is, there-",32
NA,"fore, particularly commendable because it shows",32
NA,a very tangible way that the dairy industry is,32
NA,not looking for easy options and Government,32
NA,handouts. It is realistic in facing the present,32
NA,economic difficulties of its members and has,32
NA,faced the issue with a boldness that shows that,32
NA,farmers are confident in their ability to compete,32
NA,with world market forces that are operating at,32
NA,present.,32
NA,"The new marketing arrangements are, how-",32
NA,"ever, going to affect the Western Australian in-",32
NA,dustry and some moves are expected from the,32
NA,Western Australian Government to exempt,32
NA,that Western Australian dairy farmers from the levy,32
NA,on all-milk products. If we are to have a con-,32
NA,trollable and orderly restructuring of the dairy,32
NA,"industry, the rules have to apply to everybody",32
NA,involved. Yet I hasten to add that a mechanism,32
NA,of support must be found to ease the transition,32
NA,for those more seriously affected-the Western,32
NA,"Australian, Queensland and New South Wales",32
NA,farmers in this instance. I am acutely aware of,32
NA,the severe disruption that can occur when re-,32
NA,structuring for the benefit of the nation as a,32
NA,whole affects particular regions of the nation.,32
NA,The closer economic ties and relationships,32
NA,which we have with New Zealand overall have,32
NA,probably been beneficial to Australia as a whole,32
NA,"but northern Tasmania, which includes the elec-",32
NA,"torates of Bass, Braddon and part of Lyons, has",32
NA,been seriously affected. Perhaps this was one of,32
NA,the first attempts by governments to restructure,32
NA,"in a major way for the benefit of the nation, but",32
NA,very little understanding of the affected regions,32
NA,was shown. There was no realistic appraisal by,32
NA,the Government of the pain that was caused to,32
NA,northern Tasmania by restructuring under the,32
NA,CER legislation. This legislation again raises the,32
NA,issue that certain regions will be affected. Gov-,32
NA,ernments should give cognisance to that and try,32
NA,to help these areas adjust.,32
NA,"We must restructure our industries, our indi-",32
NA,vidual enterprises and the economic base of Aus-,32
NA,"tralia and make our industrial relations, wage",32
NA,fixing and training structures more flexible so,33
NA,that industries can be far more responsive to,33
NA,changing factors in the market-place. We all,33
NA,"agree with that. At the same time, ways must",33
NA,be sought to help those who are detrimentally,33
NA,affected. In this case I call on the Government,33
NA,to consult the industry and to seek ways in,33
NA,which families of Western Australia can be as-,33
NA,"sisted in making a readjustment of their loss, on",33
NA,"average of between $4,000 to $5,000 in income",33
NA,in this legislation's first year of operation. If,33
NA,wage earners around Australia were to have,33
NA,their income dropped by $80 a week they would,33
NA,realise that it would create severe problems for,33
NA,them in their home budgets. The principle I have,33
NA,outlined should be etched into the minds of,33
NA,Government Ministers so that as the process of,33
NA,"restructuring gathers momentum, as inevitably it",33
NA,"will and must, the small people will not be",33
NA,ignored. There are some small people in the,33
NA,"dairy industry in Western Australia, New South",33
NA,Wales and Queensland who could well be ig-,33
NA,nored in this legislation.,33
NA,It is easy for people in government who draft,33
NA,policies to forget the real world of competition,33
NA,"and hardship that can"" be caused when govern-",33
NA,ments change direction. This Government to date,33
NA,has shown little practical concern for helping,33
NA,the productive sector cope with its radical,33
NA,changes. It is always interested in taxing the,33
NA,"hard working, productive sector of Australia.",33
NA,The entrepreneurs of this country are given min-,33
NA,imal incentive by this Government while it re-,33
NA,distributes wealth to the consuming sector of the,33
NA,economy as if money grows on trees. If it had,33
NA,not been for the strength and determination of,33
NA,the dairy industry's leadership and the Opposi-,33
NA,"tion's sound judgment in the Senate, dairy farm-",33
NA,ers and their families would have had the impost,33
NA,"of an uncaring, unsympathetic Kerin plan foisted",33
NA,on them. The Opposition supports the legislation,33
NA,because marked changes have occurred which,33
NA,will give a degree of security to the hard working,33
NA,dairy farmers to plan for the future. That would,33
NA,not have occurred if the 1985 legislation had,33
NA,been passed unopposed.,33
Mr FITZGIBBON ,Hunter) (11.58)-1 thank,33
NA,the Lord that the dairy farmers in the Hunter,33
NA,electorate have more sense than some politicians.,33
NA,They would have laughed at some of the biased,33
NA,"nonsense spoken by the previous speaker, the",33
NA,honourable member for Braddon ( Mr Miles). I,33
NA,am very pleased to have the opportunity to,33
NA,"speak in support of the Dairy Produce Bill 1986,",33
NA,"the Dairy Produce Levy (No.1) Bill 1986, the",33
NA,"Dairy Produce Levy (No.2) Bill 1986, the Dairy-",33
NA,ing Industry Research and Promotion Levy,33
NA,"(Termination of Levy) Bill 1986, the Dairy In-",33
NA,dustry Stabilization Levy (Termination of Levy),33
NA,Bill 1986 and the Dairy Legislation (Transitional,33
NA,Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill,33
NA,1986.,33
NA,This is the second time we have had dairy,33
NA,legislation before this House. It is important to,33
NA,stress that this legislation has been achieved after,33
NA,widespread and lengthy consultation between,33
NA,"Federal and State governments and, more im-",33
NA,"portantly, with State representatives of the in-",33
NA,dustry itself. The dairy industry supports this,33
NA,"legislation and, if a bipartisan approach can be",33
NA,"achieved, will be able to face the future with a",33
NA,degree of confidence that has not been possible,33
NA,in the past.,33
NA,The legislation provides the greatest scope for,33
NA,long term gains in economic efficiency. The prin-,33
NA,ciple objective is the development of a more,33
NA,efficient and profitable dairy industry which is,33
NA,able to respond quickly to changing market con-,33
NA,ditions and technology. The reforming of the,33
NA,Australian Dairy Corporation can do nothing,33
NA,but enhance the Corporation's ability to max-,33
NA,"imise its market opportunities, despite the fact",33
NA,that it faces a difficult market situation. The,33
NA,dairy industry has been in the doldrums for such,33
NA,a long time. The industry in the past has failed,33
NA,to agree on the direction legislation should take.,33
NA,"The Kerin plan was defeated in the other place,",33
NA,"the Rowley plan was defeated by the Victorians,",33
NA,and today we are now able to debate this legis-,33
NA,lation knowing that it has the support of the,33
NA,industry. I believe that this legislation will give,33
NA,the industry the impetus it needs to get its act,33
NA,"together, decide where it is going and move into",33
NA,"more profitable areas of export, thus ending the",33
NA,turmoil that has prevailed for so many years.,33
NA,"As I have said in this House before, the elec-",33
NA,torate of Hunter has a large dairy farming and,33
NA,"manufacturing industry, and long before I was",33
NA,"elected to represent the electorate of Hunter,",33
NA,"dairy farmers there saw the need to rationalise,",33
NA,and many opted out of the industry. Today the,33
NA,Hunter is left with some of the most modern,33
NA,and efficient dairy farms in the whole of Aus-,33
NA,"tralia, and I assure those farmers that I sincerely",33
NA,believe that this legislation will not harm them.,33
NA,"Instead, it will bring long term benefits by main-",33
NA,taining the largest Australian dairy industry that,33
NA,"is viable, at an acceptable level of industry as-",33
NA,sistance. The domestic market must be able to,33
NA,defend its position on the basis of its competi-,33
NA,tiveness and the export market must strive to,33
NA,exploit the most profitable markets and minimise,33
NA,sales that are a net loss to Australia.,33
NA,I circulated this legislation to a number of,34
NA,people in the Hunter electorate involved in the,34
NA,industry to gauge their opinion of how the leg-,34
NA,islation would affect them. I take this opportu-,34
NA,nity to express my deep appreciation to Singleton,34
NA,"Shire President, Councillor Neil MCNamara, who",34
NA,"is also a dairy farmer; Mr Bruce Payne, General",34
NA,Manager of the Hunter Valley Dairy Co-opera-,34
NA,"tive Co. Pty Ltd, at Hexham, and Mr Bob",34
NA,Baldwin of the Singleton branch of the Hunter,34
NA,Valley Dairy Co-op; Mr Bruce Whitten of,34
NA,"'Anembo', Denmam, who has been most helpful;",34
NA,"Mr Bruce Russell of 'Rockley', Singleton; Mr",34
NA,NA,34
NA,"of 'Eden Vale', Vacy; and others who found the",34
NA,time in their busy lives to consider the legislation,34
NA,and let me have their comments.,34
NA,"Overall, the comment was that the legislation",34
NA,"was well presented, and all acknowledged that",34
NA,it did have industry support from Mr Jack Eg-,34
NA,gert of the New South Wales Dairy Farmers,34
NA,Association. Some farmers expressed concern.,34
NA,One farmer expressed concern about the closer,34
NA,economic relations trade agreement with New,34
NA,Zealand and interpreted the second reading,34
NA,speech of the Minister for Primary Industry ( Mr,34
NA,Kerin) to mean that the Australian domestic,34
NA,market milk price would be reduced to the price,34
NA,"in New Zealand. However, the legislation does",34
NA,not intend to reduce the Australian domestic,34
NA,"market milk price. In fact, the Federal Govern-",34
NA,ment has no control over domestic milk prices;,34
NA,they are the province of State governments.,34
NA,What the legislation seeks to do is progres-,34
NA,sively reduce the domestic price support to not,34
NA,higher than the price level at which New Zea-,34
NA,land dairy products could be sold in Australia,34
NA,"on a fair trade basis. In other words, there will",34
NA,be no price support beyond that level. The leg-,34
NA,islation also says that under the closer economic,34
NA,"relations trade agreement with New Zealand, we",34
NA,should try to bring our dairy products into line,34
NA,"with New Zealand, so we become more compet-",34
NA,itive on international markets. Domestic milk,34
NA,prices recently went up in Victoria and Western,34
NA,"Australia, and I believe they are due to go up in",34
NA,New South Wales today. This is the result of,34
NA,industry pressure on State governments to in-,34
NA,crease the price.,34
NA,"As all honourable members are aware, the",34
NA,industry is divided into two distinct sections-,34
NA,one is the fresh milk market and the other is the,34
NA,not so profitable manufacturing milk market.,34
NA,"We export most of our manufactured milk, but,",34
NA,under the existing arrangements we often export,34
NA,"at a loss, on already oversupplied international",34
NA,"markets. Under the new arrangements, produc-",34
NA,ers and manufacturers can reap the benefits of,34
NA,their own decisions. By replacing the current,34
NA,stabilisation arrangements with a uniform level,34
NA,"of assistance for all products, we will get rid of",34
NA,the distortions that exist. People will be encour-,34
NA,"aged to be more efficient, to not over-produce,",34
NA,and to choose the right product to gain the best,34
NA,returns.,34
NA,From two dairy farmers in the Hunter Valley,34
NA,came the comment that they were concerned,34
NA,about the levy being on kilogram of milk fat,34
NA,content rather than by volume. They specifically,34
NA,mentioned that jersey cows tend to produce milk,34
NA,with a higher content of milk fat than other,34
NA,"breeds. However, most farmers are paid on milk",34
NA,fat content and technical reports on production,34
NA,of milk cattle indicate that although the milk fat,34
NA,content of milk produced by certain breeds of,34
NA,"milk cattle is higher than others, the production",34
NA,of milk fat per cow is not significantly different.,34
NA,The market support levy on all milk recog-,34
NA,nises that under the current arrangements var-,34
NA,ious methods have determined the rate of,34
NA,"payment, and this has differed from State to",34
NA,State. The new arrangement recognises these,34
NA,differences and the Government has tried to,34
NA,choose the method that is simplest and that is,34
NA,acceptable to the industry; the method which,34
NA,has the least number of enforcement problems.,34
NA,It could be argued that a levy on milk should,34
NA,be based on milk fat content and the solids non-,34
NA,"fat content of milk, the same as in the European",34
NA,Economic Community countries. But the Austra-,34
NA,lian manufacturers pay their suppliers on milk,34
NA,fat content only and have testing facilities for,34
NA,milk fat only. Installing testing facilities for sol-,34
NA,ids non-fat content could cost the industry mil-,34
NA,lions of dollars. If the industry can come up,34
NA,"with a better formula, I know that the Minister",34
NA,will be prepared to listen. As has been men-,34
NA,"tioned by other honourable members, particu-",34
NA,larly the honourable member for MCMillan ( Mr,34
NA,"Cunningham), other formulae are being",34
NA,considered.,34
NA,Another dairy farmer expressed concern about,34
NA,"over-production by the Victorians, and he felt",34
NA,that the levy might induce the Victorians to go,34
NA,on producing more and more manufactured milk,34
NA,"on an already over-supplied market, and then",34
NA,ask for an increase in the rate of the levy. The,34
NA,Government cannot set controls on production.,34
NA,The legislation seeks to reduce the gap between,34
NA,returns for fresh market milk and manufactured,34
NA,"milk, thereby reducing the incentive for farmers",34
NA,"to move into the fresh milk market. In a way,",34
NA,this is a bit of a transfer to the Victorians by,35
NA,increasing their income from manufactured milk,35
NA,"products, but at the same time it takes pressure",35
NA,off the domestic milk market. It creates stability,35
NA,and reduces the likelihood of a trade war be-,35
NA,tween the States. Nobody in the industry wants,35
NA,that.,35
NA,"If there are no arrangements in place, all dairy",35
NA,"farmers would be out of pocket, there would be",35
NA,market wars and the only ones to benefit would,35
NA,"be the consumers, and of course the New Zea-",35
NA,land dairy industry. I guess some dairy farmers,35
NA,are worrying unnecessarily about an increase in,35
NA,the levy. The levy could be increased only if the,35
NA,industry requested such an increase.,35
NA,Another comment related to the 60-day delay,35
NA,in lifting the levy-the comfort clause. Here,35
NA,"again, it was acknowledged by all farmers-all",35
NA,dairymen-that this comfort clause allowing for,35
NA,a 60-day delay had the agreement of the indus-,35
NA,try. Having a 60-day delay and also a mechanism,35
NA,whereby agreement from the other States is re-,35
NA,quired allows for a cooling-off period and will,35
NA,certainly stop people from overreacting.,35
NA,Victorians realise that there is nothing to be,35
NA,gained from a milk war. They have just as much,35
NA,to lose as their colleagues in other States. What,35
NA,the Victorians want-what all dairy farmers,35
NA,should want-is to have in place some sort of,35
NA,orderly marketing system. For this to happen,35
NA,they realise that they must try to lower their,35
NA,production to meet market-place demands. I be-,35
NA,"lieve that dairy farmers, not just in the Hunter",35
NA,"electorate, not just in New South Wales, but in",35
NA,"all other States, have shown a great deal of",35
NA,"common sense, and I believe that this legislation",35
NA,will be beneficial for all dairy farmers. This,35
NA,legislation will be beneficial because it provides,35
NA,for orderly marketing arrangements and presents,35
NA,a better balance of equity. That better balance,35
NA,and those improved marketing arrangements will,35
NA,benefit the entire industry.,35
NA,Another farmer in the Hunter electorate ex-,35
NA,pressed concern about the research levy rate.,35
NA,"Again, the dairy farmers realise that the industry",35
NA,as a whole has agreed to that rate. They have,35
NA,nothing to fear because the industry sets the,35
NA,"levy. Today, when we are facing difficult mar-",35
NA,"keting situations, research is the light at the",35
NA,of the tunnel. Every dairy farmer must realise,35
NA,that it is only by lifting our research activities,35
NA,that the industry will be able to develop new,35
NA,products which are more profitable. The whole,35
NA,spectrum of research benefits farmers and man-,35
NA,ufacturers alike and has the potential to increase,35
NA,significantly returns to the individual dairy farmer,35
NA,and to the whole industry.,35
NA,As was outlined by the Minister for Primary,35
NA,"Industry in his second reading speech, export",35
NA,pooling arrangements will cease so that exporters,35
NA,become more market responsive. By replacing,35
NA,the current stabilisation arrangements with a,35
NA,"more uniform level of assistance, a more profit-",35
NA,able mix of production will be encouraged. The,35
NA,new market support arrangements will be fi-,35
NA,nanced by a levy on all milk production. The,35
NA,local industry will continue to be protected,35
NA,"against unfair import competition, and assistance",35
NA,is to be made available for specific purposes;,35
NA,"namely, for adjustment, marketing innovation,",35
NA,"research, and dairy underwriting. All these meas-",35
NA,"ures, along with others contained in the Bills,",35
NA,should place the Australian dairy industry in a,35
NA,much better position to adjust to market signals.,35
NA,They will ensure that the industry has a long,35
NA,"term viable future, after years and years of worry.",35
NA,Not through any fault of this Government but,35
NA,because of a reluctance on the part of previous,35
NA,"governments, the dairy farmers have been",35
NA,through periods of uncertainty and turmoil.,35
NA,"Hopefully, those periods of uncertainty will come",35
NA,to an end.,35
NA,Despite what some honourable members op-,35
NA,"posite had to say in their own petty little way,",35
NA,everybody within the dairy industry knows that,35
NA,the Minister for Primary Industry has done an,35
NA,absolutely marvellous job-he has probably taken,35
NA,ten years off his life-in bringing together this,35
NA,excellent dairy legislation package. His success,35
NA,has been outstanding. He has been able to bring,35
NA,"the industry together, as it has never been brought",35
NA,"together before, to reach agreement on this leg-",35
NA,islation. I commend the Minister-a great Min-,35
NA,ister for Primary Industry-and I commend the,35
NA,Bills to the House.,35
Mr LLOYD ,Murray) (12.lS)-Like the dairy,35
NA,"farmers of Australia, the Opposition, while not",35
NA,"being actually enthusiastic about the legislation,",35
NA,will not oppose it because it is seen as the best,35
NA,possible compromise at this time. I suggest to,35
NA,the honourable member for Hunter ( Mr Fitzgib-,35
NA,"bon), who named certain dairy industry leaders",35
NA,"in his electorate, that their attitude may more",35
NA,accurately be described as accepting the inevita-,35
NA,end ble compromise rather than really being in fa-,35
NA,vour of this legislation.,35
NA,"The Dairy Produce Bill, the Dairy Produce",35
NA,"Levy (No.1) Bill, the Dairy Produce Levy (No.",35
NA,"2) Bill, the Dairying Industry Research and Pro-",35
NA,"motion Levy (Termination of Levy) Bill, the",35
NA,Dairy Industry Stabilization Levy (Termination,35
NA,of Levy) Bill and the Dairy Legislation Transi-,36
NA,tional Provisions and Consequential Amend-,36
NA,"ments) Bill, which are before us today, are",36
NA,definitely better than the legislation presented 12,36
NA,months ago by the Minister for Primary Industry,36
NA,( Mr Kerin). To say that this legislation is part,36
NA,of the Kerin plan and to say that it is in any,36
NA,way the same as the legislation introduced last,36
NA,year is not only an exaggeration but also most,36
NA,unfair both on the Minister and certainly on the,36
NA,dairy industry because of the improvements that,36
NA,have been made in that time. Because of the,36
NA,inability of the industry-it is no criticism of the,36
NA,industry to say that-in a most complex situa-,36
NA,tion to present a united and better proposal than,36
NA,"that which we have now, it certainly is the best",36
NA,the industry can expect. For that reason it has,36
NA,"the overall support of or, if you like, lack of",36
NA,opposition from the industry around Australia.,36
NA,It is certainly better to have this legislation in,36
NA,place for the next season than to continue with,36
NA,"the present arrangements, particularly when the",36
NA,Minister has the ability to change or modify,36
NA,"those arrangements, as he did for this current",36
NA,"season, and thus reduce their value. Deferring",36
NA,"that legislation for 12 months, which was spear-",36
NA,headed a year ago by the shadow Minister for,36
NA,"Primary Industry, the honourable member for",36
NA,"Gwydir ( Mr Hunt), in association with the dairy",36
NA,"industry, has been of tremendous value to the",36
NA,industry around Australia not only because of,36
NA,the additional income to the industry but also,36
NA,because of the better scheme that we have now.,36
NA,This is important legislation in that not only,36
NA,does it provide some stability for the industry,36
NA,and is a reasonable compromise between con-,36
NA,flicting interests; it is also a step towards a,36
NA,national industry. It is certainly the best hope,36
NA,that the industry has of maintaining stability on,36
NA,a national basis and of preventing a destructive,36
NA,"interstate price war, which the great majority of",36
NA,"Australian dairy farmers, including those in Vic-",36
NA,"toria, do not want to happen. I want to pay a",36
NA,"tribute to Pat Rowley, the Chairman of the",36
NA,"Australian Dairy Farmers Federation, a man",36
NA,"who has been very patient, very tolerant and",36
NA,very understanding of the complications and,36
NA,complexities in the industry. He is a great indus-,36
NA,try leader. As a Victorian dairy farmer and a,36
NA,"representative of more dairy cows, if you like,",36
NA,than any other member of the House of Repre-,36
NA,"sentatives, I certainly pay him that tribute.",36
NA,"Nevertheless, this legislation is less than the",36
NA,industry needs and deserves. The price increases,36
NA,to be allowed of 5 per cent for butter and 8 per,36
NA,cent for cheese will be the first increases for,36
NA,years. They are under half the increase in salar-,36
NA,ies and wages that the great majority of Austra-,36
NA,lians have received in that four-year period. In,36
NA,that time there has been a dramatic increase in,36
NA,the government taxes and charges that have,36
NA,been inflicted on the dairy industry and on rural,36
NA,industry generally in Australia. That has also,36
NA,been highlighted by the shadow Minister for,36
NA,Primary Industry. The legislation also provides,36
NA,less than the industry needs and deserves in that,36
NA,the underwriting level has been reduced from,36
NA,the coalition level of 95 per cent to 85 per cent.,36
NA,I acknowledge that in some ways it is a better,36
NA,"form of underwriting, but the fact that there is",36
NA,never likely to be any government commitment,36
NA,indicates what sort of weak underwriting it will,36
NA,be.,36
NA,Another factor is the closer economic relations,36
NA,"arrangement with New Zealand, as now rede-",36
NA,fined by the Minister for Primary Industry. When,36
NA,CER was negotiated with New Zealand some,36
NA,"years ago the dairy industry, to its credit, in co-",36
NA,"operation with the Australian Government, the",36
NA,industry in New Zealand and the New Zealand,36
NA,"Government, made an arrangement for a per-",36
NA,centage of cheese to come into Australia from,36
NA,"New Zealand. Beyond that, for any basic change",36
NA,to occur in dairy trade between the two coun-,36
NA,tries required the agreement of both industries,36
NA,"and, through them, of both governments. That",36
NA,was to be a permanent part of the agreement.,36
NA,Yet at the National Agricultural Outlook Con-,36
NA,ference last year we heard for the first time,36
NA,from the Minister for Primary Industry that that,36
NA,would no longer be the case. The arrangement,36
NA,was to be redefined to allow for a phase-out,36
NA,situation which would basically require an open-,36
NA,more door policy with New Zealand by 1990 to 1992.,36
NA,That is certainly not what the industries of both,36
NA,countries negotiated just a few years before.,36
NA,I believe that the fourth point of genuine,36
NA,criticism about this legislation is that the chair-,36
NA,"man of the revised, the reformed or the re-",36
NA,worked Australian Dairy Corporation should be,36
NA,a dairy farmer. That is so in the case of the,36
NA,Australian Wool Corporation; it is so in the case,36
NA,of the Australian Wheat Board. It should equally,36
NA,be so with the Dairy Corporation.,36
NA,"The all-milk levy of up to 2c a litre or, tran-",36
NA,"scribed, to a maximum of 45c per kilogram of",36
NA,"butterfat, is a step towards a more national",36
NA,industry. The comfort or escape clause which is,36
NA,"part of the all-milk levy, which allows for the",36
NA,termination of the levy if there is a breakdown,36
NA,in the arrangements by the unauthorised inter-,36
NA,four state trade in milk is something in which both I,36
NA,"and, I believe, the majority of my dairy farmers",36
NA,accept. I believe that it is both pointless and,37
NA,unfair to continue a levy if the reason for its,37
NA,being there has not been met. If there is a,37
NA,breakdown because of the entry of unauthorised,37
NA,"interstate milk, I think that it is completely",37
NA,"pointless to continue that levy and that, there-",37
NA,"fore, the comfort clause is appropriate. That all-",37
NA,milk levy is really an insurance premium paid,37
NA,by those in the protected part of the dairy in-,37
NA,dustry of Australia. It is a premium paid by,37
NA,those who supply a large percentage of their,37
NA,milk to the city or market milk sector of the,37
NA,industry. It is their insurance premium paid,37
NA,against the breakdown of the separation of pric-,37
NA,ing between manufacturing milk and market milk.,37
NA,Such an arrangement will bring financial pain,37
NA,to those dairy farmers who specialise in city milk,37
NA,production. At the estimated introductory rate,37
NA,"of It to 1.7c per litre, I am told that it will cost",37
NA,"the average dairy farmer in that situation $4,000",37
NA,"to $5,000. I acknowledge that that will mean",37
NA,real financial pain for those dairy farmers and,37
NA,that it could force some of them to leave the,37
NA,industry. It will be of value to the manufacturing,37
NA,"milk dairy farmers in Victoria, Tasmania and",37
NA,parts of New South Wales and South Australia.,37
NA,"However, I say that it is the minimum insurance",37
NA,premium necessary to provide stability in the,37
NA,industry.,37
NA,"In the Murray River area, a dairy farmer",37
NA,farming immediately south of the Murray River,37
NA,compared to a dairy farmer farming immediately,37
NA,north of the Murray River receives a dramati-,37
NA,cally reduced net income for producing the same,37
NA,"product of the same standard. To me, as an",37
NA,"Australian, in this day of refrigerated milk, this",37
NA,is an absurdity. The same situation does not,37
NA,apply to the fat lamb producer of Australia. The,37
NA,same situation does not apply to the beef cattle,37
NA,"producer, the grain producer and those who",37
NA,"make manufactured products, et cetera.",37
NA,The comparison with New Zealand in this,37
NA,regard is quite interesting at present. I am ad-,37
NA,vised that because of the termination of the very,37
NA,dramatic subsidies paid to New Zealand dairy,37
NA,farmers through the supplementary minimum,37
NA,price scheme the price paid to New Zealand,37
NA,dairy farmers in the coming season will fall by,37
NA,"about 25 per cent, from $NZ4 per kilogram",37
NA,butterfat to about $NZ3 a kilogram. What is,37
NA,interesting about that is that New Zealand also,37
NA,has a separate city milk sector and a separate,37
NA,"manufacturing milk sector, as does Australia. In",37
NA,New Zealand the city milk sector producers will,37
NA,suffer a drop of 6c a litre in what they receive,37
NA,for their milk next year because that amount,37
NA,approximates the fall in what the manufacturing,37
NA,dairy farmers in New Zealand also will receive.,37
NA,"In other words, they acknowledge the danger",37
NA,once the price for milk in the city milk sector,37
NA,gets too far away from that price paid for milk,37
NA,for the manufacturing sector. They believe that,37
NA,the insurance premium necessary for them to,37
NA,maintain their specialist role-their special sec-,37
NA,tor of the market-is worth far more than 1tc,37
NA,a litre; they believe it is worth 6c a litre. The,37
NA,pain that the New Zealand dairy farmers will,37
NA,suffer next year with a drop of about 25 per,37
NA,cent in their price actually happened to the,37
NA,manufacturing dairy sector farmers not only in,37
NA,Victoria but elsewhere in Australia three years,37
NA,ago. That pain of being confronted with the,37
NA,corrupted international dairy markets has inten-,37
NA,"sified since then, and net returns to dairy farmers",37
NA,who supply manufacturing milk are now about,37
NA,40 per cent less than what they were three years,37
NA,ago. That is exposure to the world market. That,37
NA,is exposure to market forces. That represents far,37
NA,more exposure to those manufacturing milk pro-,37
NA,ducers than for those who are able to concen-,37
NA,trate on producing city milk.,37
NA,I make the point that the greater the differ-,37
NA,ences between the manufacturing milk price and,37
NA,"the city milk price, the greater the danger of a",37
NA,"breakdown in this arrangement. Therefore, I",37
NA,think that there is a responsibility on the State,37
NA,pricing authorities to ensure that if they believe,37
NA,it is worthwhile to maintain a stable industry,37
NA,and for them to be able to maintain specialist,37
NA,"sectors of the industry in those States, that price",37
NA,gap cannot be allowed to increase.,37
NA,Mr MCGauran-Gippsland demands it.,37
Mr LLOYD,The point made by the honour-,37
NA,able member in regard to Gippsland is very,37
NA,"appropriate. Apart from me in my electorate,",37
NA,the honourable member for Gippsland probably,37
NA,represents more dairy cows than anyone else in,37
NA,Australia and the two most efficient sectors of,37
NA,the dairying industry in Australia. For anyone in,37
NA,"Queensland, for example, to say that it is unfair",37
NA,that Victorian dairy farmers should continue to,37
NA,produce milk because they have not adjusted to,37
NA,the market is like the Gippsland dairy farmer,37
NA,saying in turn: 'We used to produce sugar down,37
NA,here but we gave it away because it was more,37
NA,efficient to produce sugar in Queensland'. I think,37
NA,we should look at the dairy industry in the same,37
NA,way.,37
NA,"I make the point, on the question of adjust-",37
NA,"ment, that in the Victorian situation not only",37
NA,has there been the pain of adjustment to a 40,37
NA,per cent drop in net returns over the last few,37
NA,years and hundreds of dairy farmers leaving the,38
NA,"industry in that time, but also in the city milk",38
NA,sector of the industry in Victoria it can be seen,38
NA,that Victoria had a phase out arrangement over,38
NA,a 10-year period to end its milk quotas in order,38
NA,to rely on a price incentive to enable it to,38
NA,provide enough milk in those more difficult times,38
NA,of the year. That lO-year period has just· fin-,38
NA,ished. Quite a number of Victorian dairy farmers,38
NA,will cease production because they have been in,38
NA,that high priced specialist sector. Victorian dairy,38
NA,farmers ask why the other eastern States do not,38
NA,put their own city milk sectors in more efficient,38
NA,order and make them as efficient as they can by,38
NA,doing the same thing as has been done in Vic-,38
NA,toria. I personally believe that both Queensland,38
NA,and New South Wales could continue to pro-,38
NA,duce all the milk they need for their own city,38
NA,milk requirements 12 months of the year by,38
NA,using a price incentive system rather than a,38
NA,"quota system, and in a far more efficient way.",38
NA,My last point is that when one talks about,38
NA,fair competition in the industry-we are talking,38
NA,about it now-one also has to include fair com-,38
NA,petition from overseas. We talk in particular in,38
NA,this regard about cheese imports from Europe-,38
NA,not just from the European Economic Commu-,38
NA,nity. We are not talking just about subsidised,38
NA,imports; we are talking about the addition of,38
NA,additives and preservatives to those products-,38
NA,additives and preservatives which are banned in,38
NA,Australia because they are considered a danger,38
NA,to the health of the people of Australia. We,38
NA,have been told-I have tended to accept this-,38
NA,that because the pure food Act powers are under,38
NA,the control of the States rather than the Com-,38
NA,"monwealth, we have to wait for the model food",38
NA,legislation-which is taking some years to come,38
NA,"through, but which is on its way-when we will",38
NA,be able to do something on a uniform basis. We,38
NA,will then be able to say that that cheese coming,38
NA,from France will no longer be allowed in be-,38
NA,cause it contains a preservative which we con-,38
NA,sider to be injurious to our health in Australia.,38
NA,"That explanation was fine until 8 May, when",38
NA,"in this place the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke),",38
NA,in response to a good question asked by the,38
NA,honourable member for Wannon ( Mr Hawker),38
NA,in relation to contaminated foodstuffs from the,38
NA,area contaminated by the Chernobyl nuclear dis-,38
NA,"aster in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,",38
NA,said:,38
NA,. . . the Department of Health asked the Austra-,38
NA,lian Customs Service to hold all food consignments,38
NA,which left the potentially affected countries on or after,38
NA,"25 April. Should it prove necessary, the Department",38
NA,will establish a mechanism for monitoring these partic-,38
NA,ular food imports with the Customs Serv-,38
NA,ice . . . As the Department gets further,38
NA,"information, those controls will be adjusted if necessary.",38
NA,"Suddenly, out of the blue, we have a Com-",38
NA,monwealth power. We have a Commonwealth,38
NA,power to stop dangerous food substances coming,38
NA,into this country. What the hell! Consider all,38
NA,the time that we have lost with not having the,38
NA,power to stop the import of these dairy products,38
NA,containing additives. If honourable members be-,38
NA,"lieve that I am joking, I will inform them of",38
NA,something that happened in California recently.,38
NA,Cheese imports to the United States from the,38
NA,Bessnier cheese company of France caused the,38
NA,death of 85 people in California last year. In,38
NA,response to a question on notice from me as to,38
NA,whether any of the cheese from this same com-,38
NA,"pany was coming in to Australia, the answer was",38
NA,yes. What are we doing about it? We found out,38
NA,"that it is not the same brand, but everybody",38
NA,knows that different brands are put on the same,38
NA,"production line, depending on the country to",38
NA,which the brand is going. That is all that has,38
NA,"been done, other than to refer it to the States to",38
NA,see whether they want to check it. Australian,38
NA,consumers are being exposed to great dangers,38
NA,and this is a specific example of the great danger,38
NA,"of injurious foods-in this case, cheese-being",38
NA,imported. I conclude by making the point that,38
NA,when we talk about fair competition we are,38
NA,talking not just about fair competition for the,38
NA,dairy industry in Australia but about fair com-,38
NA,petition from New Zealand and particularly from,38
NA,Europe. Fair competition does not mean just,38
NA,"price, it means the quality of the product. I",38
NA,support the legislation.,38
Mr SNOW ,Eden-Monaro) (12.31)-The,38
NA,"Dairy Produce Bill, the Dairy Produce Levy",38
NA,"(No.1) Bill, the Dairy Produce Levy (No.2)",38
NA,"Bill, the Dairying Industry Research and Pro-",38
NA,"motion Levy (Termination of Levy) Bill, the",38
NA,Dairy Industry Stabilization Levy (Termination,38
NA,of Levy) Bill and the Dairy Legislation (Tran-,38
NA,sitional Provisions and Consequential Amend-,38
NA,ments) Bill include some small but very,38
NA,significant changes to the Bills dealt with by the,38
NA,Parliament last year. Consultation between the,38
NA,industry and the Government has led to this,38
NA,"legislation which, while based substantially on",38
NA,"previous legislation, is far more widely accepted.",38
NA,I congratulate the industry and the Minister for,38
NA,Primary Industry ( Mr Kerin) for their intermin-,38
NA,able patience and preparedness continually to,38
NA,"discuss, probe and rehash the various proposals.",38
NA,The Bills provide for a number of changes,38
NA,"which will overcome many, if not all, of the",38
NA,"inefficiencies of the present arrangements. Firstly,",38
NA,the overall aim is to turn our attention to the,39
NA,more profitable export markets and to disc-ur­,39
NA,"age sales to the loss making markets. Secondly,",39
NA,the BiIIs will improve the accountability to the,39
NA,industry of the Australian Dairy Corporation.,39
NA,"Thirdly, instead of a range of different levies,",39
NA,"charges and support rates for different products,",39
NA,the Bills provide for an all milk levy. There,39
NA,be no artificial or contrived distortions to the,39
NA,market signals.,39
NA,Because any change creates uncertainty and,39
NA,"confusion, the initial market support rate will",39
NA,"set at 30 per cent, which closely parallels the",39
NA,current export pooling figure. This rate can be,39
NA,altered by mutual agreement between the Cor-,39
NA,poration and the Council of the Australian Dairy,39
NA,Industry Conference. The industry will decide,39
NA,"its own rate, not members of parliament or",39
NA,"bureaucrats. To assist the transition further, a",39
NA,supplementary series of payments wiII be made.,39
NA,These will decline over time as the levies which,39
NA,are used to fund them are reduced. As with,39
NA,"most changes, a lot depends on consistent eco-",39
NA,nomic policies by the government of the day. In,39
NA,"that light, one potential trouble spot in the ar-",39
NA,rangements is the concept of reducing domestic,39
NA,price support until it is in accord with a fair,39
NA,New Zealand price. This could be a problem if,39
NA,wages and government charges are not kept sta-,39
NA,"ble, as they have been under the Hawke Labor",39
NA,Government.,39
NA,The Minister's motives in leading up to this,39
NA,legislation over years rather than months have,39
NA,"never been doubted by the industry leaders, right",39
NA,through the discussions. In public and private,39
NA,discussions the Minister dealt with the interests,39
NA,"of the industry, consumers and the Government",39
NA,"with honesty and discernment, but above all",39
NA,with wisdom based on his wide knowledge and,39
NA,experience of the industry. Having been involved,39
NA,"in extensive discussions, lobbying and sheer hard",39
NA,"work with many industry leaders, I see this leg-",39
NA,"islation, the end result, as a direct consequence",39
NA,"of vigorous work by people such as Pat Rowley,",39
NA,the President of the Dairy Farmers Federation;,39
NA,Clay Manners; and Phillip Armstrong and his,39
NA,associates from Bega Co-op Society Ltd. Pat,39
NA,"Rowley, on behalf of the Australian Dairy",39
NA,"Farmers Federation, has thanked me for my",39
NA,"work. More importantly, he has said that the",39
NA,package of legislation wiII be worth tens of,39
NA,lions of dollars more to the industry.,39
NA,I return to the point I made concerning the,39
NA,problem of the effect of possible wage and price,39
NA,changes on the industry and the potential trou-,39
NA,ble spot in reducing domestic price support until,39
NA,"It IS In accord with a fair New Zealand price,",39
NA,unless we have that stability. I remind my col-,39
NA,leagues and listeners of the rampant and hap-,39
NA,hazard wage and price movements during the,39
NA,Fraser years. Without a wage policy or an ac-,39
NA,"cord, oil refinery workers at that time were able",39
NA,to gain large wage increases because the oil,39
NA,"will companies, which could pass on costs to the",39
NA,"farmers, fishermen, truckies and the general mo-",39
NA,"toring public, capitulated to their demands.",39
NA,The latest Opposition policy on industrial re-,39
NA,be lations would make things worse and I believe,39
NA,that it could have a significant effect on the,39
NA,dairy industry. The proposal in the coalition,39
NA,policy to replace award rates with negotiated,39
NA,rates between employers and employees would,39
NA,lead to even higher wages for those earners with,39
NA,"industrial muscle, lower wages for those workers",39
NA,in the country who have no industrial muscle,39
NA,and more of the old Fraser-Howard wage price,39
NA,"spirals nationally. This would hinder, or perhaps",39
NA,"even obliterate, the competitive aim of a reduc-",39
NA,tion in domestic price support.,39
NA,One of the most significant factors of this Bill,39
NA,is the improved market signals which will result,39
NA,from it. Current underwritten prices are 90 per,39
NA,cent of a three-year average. This allows the,39
NA,underwriting mechanism to be triggered as prices,39
NA,decline after a period of buoyant prices. This,39
NA,could and did occur even though the absolute,39
NA,"prices were relatively good. On the other hand,",39
NA,"if prices declined gradually over a long period,",39
NA,the mechanism was not triggered. This not only,39
NA,deprived everyone involved of a proper price for,39
NA,their product but also masked any market signals.,39
NA,The two major problems which have been,39
NA,collectivdy perceived by the industry in Victoria,39
NA,and New South Wales are the need for an initial,39
NA,domestic price increase and the need for protec-,39
NA,tion from market disruption by people seIling in,39
NA,desperation at below the cost of production and,39
NA,distribution or a little above that cost. In the,39
NA,"light of that, the Government has allowed for a",39
NA,domestic market price increase. The Govern-,39
NA,ment has agreed to implement a domestic mar-,39
NA,ket price increase for butter and cheese effective,39
NA,from 1 July. The Australian Dairy Corporation,39
NA,had recommended a 5 per cent increase in butter,39
NA,prices and an 8 per cent increase in cheese,39
NA,"mil- prices, and the Government has accepted the",39
NA,ADC's recommendation. If we are to allow those,39
NA,"domestic market price increases, we need to",39
NA,balance them with an escape clause to offset the,39
NA,anxiety in some States of supporting the export,39
NA,of dairy products by a levy on all milk in the,39
NA,event of a collapse in market milk prices. The,39
NA,Government has agreed to insert an escape clause,40
NA,in clause 6 of the Dairy Produce Levy (No.1),40
NA,Bill. The inclusion of that clause in the legisla-,40
NA,tion is endorsed by all State dairy farmer,40
NA,organisations.,40
NA,World milk production is currently around,40
NA,"500 million tonnes, 60 per cent of which is",40
NA,produced in three regions; the European Eco-,40
NA,"nomic Community, the United States of Amer-",40
NA,ica and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.,40
NA,The majority of milk produced in those coun-,40
NA,tries is consumed within those countries; only 6,40
NA,per cent enters the world trade. Historically the,40
NA,European Economic Community has been the,40
NA,major stockholder and the major exporting re-,40
NA,"gion, accounting for about half of global stocks.",40
NA,Relatively low economic growth in the major,40
NA,"importing countries, together with their debt",40
NA,"servicing problems, has seriously affected the",40
NA,trade patterns of the European Economic Com-,40
NA,munity. In 1983 production exceeded consump-,40
NA,"tion by approximately 21 million tonnes, which",40
NA,is 19 per cent of its total annual output. Some,40
NA,idea of the impact that has had on world mar-,40
NA,kets can be seen by considering that in 1984 the,40
NA,European Economic Community sold 222 kilo-,40
NA,tons of butter to the Soviet Union at prices,40
NA,below the General Agreement on Tariffs and,40
NA,Trade minimum. It is estimated that at present,40
NA,international stocks of butter are at a level of,40
NA,"1.2 million tonnes. Where would the world, and",40
NA,particularly the European Community be with-,40
NA,out preservatives?,40
NA,I turn to Australia's position in world trade.,40
NA,We are a relatively small exporter of dairy prod-,40
NA,"ucts. About a quarter of our output is exported,",40
NA,but that accounts for only between 2 per cent,40
NA,and 8 per cent in various world product markets.,40
NA,Our dairy industry represents between 6 per cent,40
NA,and 8 per cent of rural production. That is still,40
NA,a major component of the economy. It also,40
NA,represents 3 to 4 per cent of Australia's exports.,40
NA,The Australian dairy industry is extremely effi-,40
NA,"-ient. The milk yield per cow, for instance, has",40
NA,mcreased by 18 per cent since 1970. Australia is,40
NA,internationally accepted as being the most effi-,40
NA,cient milk producer. I have had great pleasure,40
NA,in representing the most efficient producers within,40
NA,Australia in spite of what our Victorian col-,40
NA,leagues have said. I refer to those in the south,40
NA,"coast area-the Bega Valley Shire, the Eurobod-",40
NA,alIa Shire and the City of Shoalhaven.,40
NA,Part of the problem leading up to this legisla-,40
NA,tion is that the pattern throughout Australia is,40
NA,extremely uneven. Hence the different responses,40
NA,"to this legislation, even today. Even within polit12.45",40
NA,ical parties we have seen different responses to,40
NA,the legislation. Seventy-three per cent of our,40
NA,"national output goes into manufacturing milk,",40
NA,yet in Victoria manufacturing milk constitutes,40
NA,87 per cent of output. Further insight into our,40
NA,unbalanced production pattern can be gained by,40
NA,comparing the two major milk-producing States-,40
NA,New South Wales and Victoria. Victoria pro-,40
NA,"duces 57.6 per cent of total milk output, repre-",40
NA,senting 28 per cent of total market milk sales,40
NA,and 68 per cent of manufacturing milk. On the,40
NA,"other hand, New South Wales output represents",40
NA,"16 per cent of total production, being 35 per",40
NA,cent of all market milk sales and only 9 per cent,40
NA,of the manufacturing milk. Victoria produces 68,40
NA,per cent of the manufacturing milk and New,40
NA,South Wales produces 9 per cent.,40
NA,As can be seen from the broad range of figures,40
NA,"that I have cited, Australia is only a relatively",40
NA,"small participant in the world trade. As a r!!suit,",40
NA,we are at the mercy of large-albeit relatively,40
NA,inefficient-producers such as those in the Eu-,40
NA,ropean community and the United States of,40
NA,America. We also have our own unbalanced,40
NA,internal production pattern with different areas,40
NA,concentrating on different sectors of production.,40
NA,"For this reason, I believe it is vital that we",40
NA,overhaul our markets and our production strat-,40
NA,egies. These Bills seek to do just that. The dairy,40
NA,industry traditionally has been one of boom or,40
NA,bust. To quite an extent it is in the export area,40
NA,that a lot of problems have been created. Our,40
NA,consumption has been fairly stable and our,40
NA,growth has been fairly predictable.,40
NA,Legislation before us today is designed gradu-,40
NA,ally to move away from the low-priced end of,40
NA,the market and to stop exports of products at,40
NA,"below cost, discourage the processors and co-",40
NA,operatives from taking milk at any price-even,40
NA,"as low as perhaps one cent a litre, just to take",40
NA,it from the producer-concentrate our efforts on,40
NA,the more lucrative areas and make the market,40
NA,signals to our producers much clearer and at a,40
NA,much earlier stage. Surely this is much fairer to,40
NA,them as well as to the consumer. To sum up the,40
NA,"words of Pat Rowley, the President of the Aus-",40
NA,"tralian Dairy Farmers Federation, in money terms",40
NA,this legislation will be worth tens of millions of,40
NA,dollars more to the industry. I have great pleas-,40
NA,ure in supporting the Bills before the House.,40

NA,"Hayden and Evans, will the Acting Prime Min-",41
NA,ister confirm that two such agreements are being,41
NA,"or have been drafted; and, if so, why the ParliaUnited",41
NA,ment and the people of Australia have not been,41
NA,"told that ANZUS; our most basic defence treaty,",41
NA,is to be scrapped?,41
Mr LIONEL BOWEN,It must be clearly,41
NA,understood that in the process of policy formu-,41
NA,lation there are committees' of the parties that,41
NA,make suggestions which even the Liberal Party,41
NA,of Australia at times is not prepared to accept.,41
NA,I can understand that there might be a view that,41
NA,there is a need to talk about ANZUS in another,41
NA,form. It is certainly not official. From the Govthere,41
NA,ernment's point of view there has been no,41
NA,recommendation.,41
NA,NA,41
NA,committee.,41
Mr LIONEL BOWEN,That does not mean,41
NA,a lot in terms of the recommendation. We are a,41
NA,very democratic party and everybody has a right,41
NA,to express a point of view. ANZUS is a very,41
NA,important aspect of treaty organisations in the,41
NA,whole of the Pacific region. The Prime Minister,41
NA,has already indicated the support of the Govern-,41
NA,ment for the continuance of that treaty. I would,41
NA,think it would require strong evidence to suggest,41
NA,that it might be altered in any way.,41
NA,"As honourable members will be aware, the",41
NA,Government has already indicated that it is very,41
NA,anxious to ensure that there is continued peace,41
NA,and stability in the whole of the Pacific region.,41
NA,ANZUS is a very important part of that. The,41
NA,honourable gentleman would be aware that in,41
NA,"parts of the world, not only in the Pacific, it is",41
NA,recognised that there is concern about nuclear,41
NA,weapons and matters of that nature. The whole,41
NA,question of whether there has been some defect,41
NA,"in ANZUS, which I do not think there is, was",41
NA,the concept of visiting nuclear powered war-,41
NA,ships. A problem which has attracted public,41
NA,opinion in New Zealand is the tendency to per-,41
NA,haps talk about ANZUS in a form other than,41
NA,allowing nuclear armed warships to visit its ports.,41
NA,I think that is the whole weakness of the struc-,41
NA,ture. I would have thought that if the United,41
NA,States had had a chance to discuss this matter,41
NA,in a better atmosphere than apparently occurred,41
NA,at the time we would have found that the New,41
NA,Zealand people fully support close collaboration,41
NA,with the United States in stability and peace in,41
NA,the whole of the Pacific region. The one concept,41
NA,that seemed to concern them was the fact that,41
NA,there might have been nuclear powered warships,41
NA,visiting their country.,41
NA,I know that is a distinction the honourable,41
NA,gentleman would be able to understand. The,41
NA,States was not prepared to identify its,41
NA,warships on the basis that they would become,41
NA,vulnerable. No other power in the world identi-,41
NA,"fies its nuclear armed warships, so for that rea-",41
NA,son there is a very clear understanding why the,41
NA,United States is reticent to disclose the identity,41
NA,of weaponry on its ships. For that reason I do,41
NA,not think the honourable gentleman should be,41
NA,unduly concerned about whether there would be,41
NA,"any weakening of ANZUS. In my view, the",41
NA,Government is firmly committed to ANZUS. Of,41
NA,"course, in party deliberations in a democracy",41
NA,"are different points of view, all of which",41
NA,"must be listened to, but from the point of view",41
NA,of a committee making recommendations to a,41
NA,national conference I would not give the rec-,41
NA,ommendations any greater weight at this stage.,41
NA,WAGE INCREASE,41
Mr ALLAN MORRIS,My question is ad-,41
NA,dressed to the Minister for Employment and,41
NA,Industrial Relations. Is it a fact that the Govern-,41
NA,ment and the Australian Council of Trade,41
NA,"Unions, in recognition of the inflationary and",41
NA,"other effects of devaluation, have made submis-",41
NA,sions to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitra-,41
NA,tion Commission that would reduce the next,41
NA,wage increase by 2 per cent? Is it also a fact,41
NA,that Australian unions and workers in general,41
NA,have accepted the need for this discounting of,41
NA,the next wage increase? Can the Minister advise,41
NA,the House what action the Government is taking,41
NA,to attempt to ensure that other people working,41
NA,"in Australia in professions, in executive positions",41
NA,and in the various other areas not covered by,42
NA,the national wage case have their income in-,42
NA,creases discounted by 2 per cent? Will the Min-,42
NA,ister further advise the House whether the many,42
NA,professional and business organisations who are,42
NA,calling on the Government to cut real wages,42
NA,further are making any real effort to achieve at,42
NA,least the 2 per cent discounting agreed to by the,42
NA,Government and the ACTU?,42
Mr WILLIS,The answer to the first two,42
NA,"parts of the honourable member's question is, of",42
NA,"course, yes. As a consequence, it is likely that,",42
NA,"as in the current national wage case, the out-",42
NA,come will be an adjustment of wages of at least,42
NA,2 per cent less than the increases that would,42
NA,come with full indexation. So we see that there,42
NA,is a considerable adjustment taking place with,42
NA,the agreement of the ACTU and the trade union,42
NA,movement. The thrust of the honourable gentle-,42
NA,"man's question is, of course, one with which the",42
NA,Government very much agrees. If there is to be,42
NA,restraint exercised by wage and salary earners it,42
NA,is very important that restraint is exercised by,42
NA,all sections of the community. That is something,42
NA,that was unanimously agreed to by all parties at,42
NA,what was a summit in this chamber in 1983.,42
NA,Since that time action has been taken by the,42
NA,Government to try to ensure that there would,42
NA,be restraint in the environment of wage and,42
NA,"salary earners, and that there be restraint by",42
NA,"other income recipients. In that respect, action",42
NA,has been taken to establish a number of tribunals,42
NA,to look at establishing the fees in relation to,42
NA,some of the professions. I refer to the Pharma-,42
NA,ceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal; the,42
NA,"Federal Costs Advisory Committee, which deter-",42
NA,mines solicitors' cost scales in the Federal legal,42
NA,"jurisdiction; the medical fees inquiry, which this",42
NA,year unfortunately has been walked away from,42
NA,by the Australian Medical Association and its,42
NA,surgeons-the Government has made a decision,42
NA,"of its own in that respect for this year, but",42
NA,prefers the inquiry approach-and also in rela-,42
NA,tion to pathology services.,42
NA,In respect of all of those tribunals or fee,42
NA,setting processes there have been two elements,42
NA,to the consideration. In all those cases it has a,42
NA,member of the Arbitration Commission who has,42
NA,formed the tribunal or inquiry which has looked,42
NA,at fees in two respects: One is a net income,42
NA,component and the other is a professional costs,42
NA,component. In both those respects they have had,42
NA,"regard to wage fixing principles; that is, they",42
NA,have adjusted costs only where they have moved,42
NA,"in line with wages, where they are wage costs.",42
NA,In respect of net incomes they have looked at,42
NA,the reason for those incomes to increase in line,42
NA,with movement for wage and salary earners. So,42
NA,the members of those tribunals have had very,42
NA,much in mind the need for the national wage,42
NA,fixing principles to apply in those areas.,42
NA,Reviews have also been conducted of fee set-,42
NA,ting processes for various other professionals such,42
NA,"as architects, consulting engineers, accountants,",42
NA,"dentists, quantity surveyors and veterinarians,",42
NA,and one review will start shortly on land survey-,42
NA,ors. All those have been conducted by members,42
NA,"of the Arbitration Commission, with the agree-",42
NA,"ment of the professions, and have generally been",42
NA,established to ensure that the fee setting proc-,42
NA,esses are such as to mean that the general prin-,42
NA,ciples applying to wage and salary earners apply,42
NA,in these areas to the extent that it is appropriate.,42
NA,That has given substantial assurance that in the,42
NA,area of the professions there has been that close,42
NA,association of principles applying in the profes-,42
NA,sional fee setting area with wage and salary,42
NA,earners.,42
NA,"In relation to executive remuneration, the Ad-",42
NA,visory Committee on Prices and Incomes has,42
NA,kept a close watch on that with available mate-,42
NA,rial and has also commissioned some material.,42
NA,"Over the period we have been in government,",42
NA,broadly speaking executive remuneration has,42
NA,been moving in line with that of wage and salary,42
NA,earners. We will be keeping a close check on,42
NA,that to ensure that that will continue to be the,42
NA,"case. An examination of profits, dividends and",42
NA,"investment has been conducted, which has shown",42
NA,that restraint has been exercised generally in,42
NA,respect of dividend policy. We would also expect,42
NA,that to continue. It is also establishing a meas-,42
NA,urement of profits and an agreement to a vol-,42
NA,untary standard within the accounting profession,42
NA,in respect of the use of that measurement of,42
NA,profits. We hope that that will be achieved in,42
NA,the near future.,42
NA,"Finally, in relation to price restraint let me",42
NA,"say that the Prices Surveillance Authority has,",42
NA,"of course, been established. That body was in-",42
NA,structed by the Treasurer last year to ensure,42
NA,that the policy it pursued in respect of pricing,42
NA,matters which come before it was such that,42
NA,prices did not increase in excess of movements,42
NA,in unit costs. That is a general principle which,42
NA,"appropriately applies, and rightly so.",42
NA,"So, a number of processes have been estab-",42
NA,lished to try to ensure that restraint is exercised,42
NA,"across the board. Of course, I note the objections",42
NA,of members of the Opposition who do not care,42
NA,about what happens to the incomes of others.,42
NA,They think that restraints should apply to wage,42
NA,and salary earners. They do not give a damn,43
NA,what happens in respect of other areas and,43
NA,"believe that people can do as they like. That, of",43
NA,"course, is not a policy which is accepted by the",43
NA,Government. We will be continuing to monitor,43
NA,"this area and, if further steps are needed to",43
NA,ensure that restraint is exercised in the non-wage,43
NA,"income area, we will take those steps.",43
NA,TAXATION REFORM,43
Mr HOWARD,My question is addressed to,43
NA,the Treasurer. I refer the honourable gentleman,43
NA,to the Prime Minister's enunciation last year of,43
NA,nine fundamental principles of tax reform. In,43
NA,particular I refer him to the fourth and eighth,43
NA,of those principles. The fourth principle read as,43
NA,follows:,43
NA,"Any reform must lead to a simpler system, which",43
NA,therefore all Australians can understand easily.,43
NA,The other principle is:,43
NA,Any reform must provide the best possible climate,43
NA,"for investment, growth and employment in Australia.",43
NA,I ask the Treasurer: By what stretch of imagi-,43
NA,nation can the fringe benefits tax legislation of,43
NA,"139 pages, the capital gains tax legislation of 103",43
NA,"pages, the negative gearing legislation of 47 pages,",43
NA,and the other legislation introduced last night of,43
NA,"77 pages, meet the Prime Minister's criteria for",43
NA,"sensible tax reform? Furthermore, will the",43
NA,Treasurer indicate whether his inability to pro-,43
NA,vide the Parliament with explanatory memo-,43
NA,randa for the capital gains tax and the foreign,43
NA,tax credit legislation is due to administrative,43
NA,"incompetence, or is it the sheer complexity of",43
NA,the legislation which is defying proper,43
NA,explanation?,43
Mr KEATING,"Just on the last point, the",43
NA,Government provided the Opposition with all of,43
NA,the documentation it had three hours before I,43
NA,"presented the Bills last night, including the Bills",43
NA,themselves and those explanatory memoranda,43
NA,which were available. The reason that the other,43
NA,material is not available is not just that we have,43
NA,had continual difficulties in getting all of this,43
NA,drafted but also that there have been industrial,43
NA,problems in the printery this week. I might just,43
NA,"add that, despite the wailing by the honourable",43
NA,"member for Mackellar last evening, and despite",43
NA,the fact that the Government provided these,43
NA,"things to Senator Messner three hours later, when",43
NA,I provided a briefing on the Bills this morning,43
NA,"by tax officers, the honourable member for",43
NA,Mackellar never even bothered to turn up. So,43
NA,what about that? A couple of staff people ar-,43
NA,rived. Although the honourable member has,43
NA,"made such a brouhaha about it, he did not even",43
NA,have the decency to turn up and listen or ask a,43
NA,question. This really meant that he was trying,43
NA,to make a cheap political point rather than learn,43
NA,"something, which I understood was his attitude",43
NA,in the first place.,43
NA,Let me deal with the first question. This man,43
NA,who made a swill of the Australian tax system,43
NA,and who was dragged into doing something about,43
NA,it by the MCCabe-Lafranchi report and the re-,43
NA,port of the Costigan Royal Commission on the,43
NA,Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and,43
NA,"Dockers Union, now wishes to refer to the Prime",43
NA,Minister's nine principles in respect of tax re-,43
NA,form as some sort of reason why the Govern-,43
NA,ment should not move on tax avoidance in the,43
NA,"fringe benefits area and why the Government, in",43
NA,"a capital scarce country, ought not to do some-",43
NA,thing about the proper placement of capital,43
NA,"rather than seeing it squandered, by tax driven",43
NA,"decisions, in areas of tax free capital gains. What",43
NA,we see is the Opposition using any port of call,43
NA,to continue its barrage and its sham of a policy,43
NA,for its inaction of years gone by in terms of,43
NA,"fairness, equity and decency in the tax system.",43
NA,The Leader of the Oppc;sition referred to the,43
NA,number of pages in the 'Fringe Benefits Tax-a,43
NA,"Guide for Employers'. Obviously, there are a lot",43
NA,of different kinds of fringe benefits and the,43
NA,booklet devotes a couple of pages to each one. I,43
NA,would have thought that the fact that there are,43
NA,so many pages was one of the reasons why the,43
NA,former Treasurer should have moved against it.,43
NA,The fact that a couple of pages are devoted to,43
NA,each fringe benefit is the reason why there are,43
NA,so many pages. Those pages are designed to help,43
NA,people and to tell taxpayers and companies what,43
NA,their obligations are. There is no point in Op-,43
NA,position members manufacturing mock indigna-,43
NA,tion about some burdens being placed on,43
NA,employers by their having to read these docu-,43
NA,ments or their being forced to attend to these,43
NA,matters. We all know that employers have had,43
NA,cheaper labour than they would otherwise have,43
NA,had by using the fringe benefit mechanism. They,43
NA,have been able to engage the service of people,43
NA,without paying higher levels of remuneration,43
NA,because they have been able to split between the,43
NA,employer and the employee what would other-,43
NA,wise have been the tax payable. The only people,43
NA,who have had to bear the burden of that are,43
NA,the ordinary men and women-the ordinary tax-,43
NA,payers-of this country who have had to pay for,43
NA,all of the fringe benefits of higher income tax-,43
NA,"payers, for whom paying tax was always op-",43
NA,tional under the coalition Government. The,43
NA,coalition Government was never interested in,43
NA,closing tax loopholes; it always left them open,43
NA,like some sort of tax collander for people to fall,44
NA,through. Thus higher income earners have not,44
NA,"had to pay their fair share of tax, while every",44
NA,other person has had to pay it.,44
NA,"Apparently, the morality of tax law is now to",44
NA,be measured on the basis of how many pages,44
NA,the Government requires business people to read.,44
NA,That is the apologia: The reason why we should,44
NA,not move on tax reform is that we ask somebody,44
NA,to read a 100-page booklet about fringe benefits,44
NA,from which he has massively benefited. If that is,44
NA,the standard of coalition morality on tax policy,44
NA,it is no wonder that the coalition is still in,44
NA,opposition. If it keeps to that standard of moral-,44
NA,ity it will stay there.,44
NA,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,44
NA,GAMES TEAM,44
Mr STAPLES,Has the attention of the,44
NA,"Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism been",44
NA,drawn to Press reports that the Australian Com-,44
NA,monwealth Games team is in serious financial,44
NA,difficulty and that Australian athletes may have,44
NA,to miss the Games?,44
Mr JOHN BROWN,"I am aware of reports,",44
NA,particularly a very florid article on the front,44
NA,page of the Telegraph this morning which is a,44
NA,fairly cheap beat-up. I can assure the House that,44
NA,officers of the Australian Sports Commission have,44
NA,been in touch with the Commonwealth Games,44
NA,Association and are monitoring this matter,44
NA,closely. I think everybody would understand that,44
NA,"the Commonwealth Games Association, given",44
NA,"the time scale, has had difficulty in raising the",44
NA,money that it may have required because it is,44
NA,"competing with the America's Cup, bicentennial",44
NA,projects and also the 1992 Olympic Games for,44
NA,"funding. Thus, it is in a difficult climate for",44
NA,"raising funds. However, my advice is that sup-",44
NA,port has picked up well. With the campaign it,44
NA,has been running for the sale of $25 bonds,44
NA,through the stock exchanges-with the advan-,44
NA,"tage, I might add, of taxation deductibility pro-",44
NA,"vided by the Government, and in particular the",44
NA,Treasurer; it is the first time ever that this,44
NA,efit has been available for either the Common-,44
NA,wealth Games or the Olympic Games-the,44
NA,Australian Commonwealth Games team is well,44
NA,on track and there is certainly no question of,44
NA,athletes being left behind.,44
NA,"I should also add that the Australian team,",44
NA,"which comprises 310 competitors and officials,",44
NA,represents the largest Australian team ever to go,44
NA,to a Commonwealth Games or Olympic Games.,44
NA,Given the extraordinarily successful results we,44
NA,"had in Brisbane, we hope to leave Edinburgh",44
NA,with the highest swag of gold medals. I think it,44
NA,is also worth making the point that the taxpay-,44
NA,"ers of Australia, through the Federal Govern-",44
NA,"ment, have contributed $900,000 to the funding",44
NA,of the Commonwealth Games team. This is the,44
NA,largest amount ever contributed to such a team;,44
NA,"in fact, it was the amount asked of us by the",44
NA,Commonwealth Games Association. We all know,44
NA,that this team will give of its best: I am sure,44
NA,that it will perform in a way that will bring,44
NA,pride to every Australian. I hope that the news-,44
NA,"paper article this morning, as florid and as mis-",44
NA,"leading as it was, will engender even more",44
NA,support from the commercial and private sector,44
NA,"in Australia, and in particular from private citi-",44
NA,"zens, to see that this team, which promises so",44
NA,"much, is at least properly funded.",44
NA,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,44
Mr HUNT,I refer the Treasurer to the sit-,44
NA,uation of a wheat farmer who has one employee,44
NA,and whose family lives in rent free accommoda-,44
NA,tion on the property. If the value of the employ-,44
NA,ee's accommodation is assessed at $60 a week,44
NA,"and his use of power, fuel, farm vehicles, et",44
NA,"cetera is assessed at a further $60 a week, will",44
NA,the employer's tax liability increase by about,44
NA,"$3,000 per year under the fringe benefits tax? In",44
NA,view of the fact that the average wheat farmer,44
NA,is already suffering record losses in income and,44
NA,is paying excessive interest rates on record in-,44
NA,"debtedness, is the Treasurer concerned about the",44
NA,consequent increase in unemployment in rural,44
NA,areas and the inability of farmers to continue to,44
NA,employ people?,44
Mr KEATING,The Government has made,44
NA,the fringe benefits tax arrangements on housing,44
NA,in rural Australia extremely concessionary. It has,44
NA,done so in consultation with the various indus-,44
NA,tries concerned. It has taken in all cases what,44
NA,could reasonably be believed to be the lowest,44
NA,possible basis of valuation for rental purposes,44
NA,and fringe benefits provided. It is on that basis,44
NA,that we are confident that no liability imposed,44
NA,benon a member of a business providing fringe ben-,44
NA,efits in the accommodation area in this way is,44
NA,unduly harsh. I am not in a position to do the,44
NA,calculations the honourable gentleman requires,44
NA,"of me on my feet, except to give him that",44
NA,assurance.,44
NA,COMMONWEALTH TAXATION LAWS:,44
NA,CLAIMS BY QUEENSLAND PREMIER,44
Mr HUMPHREYS,Is the Treasurer aware,44
NA,of claims by the Queensland Premier that he,44
NA,plans to break Commonwealth taxation laws?,44
NA,What is the Government's reaction to these,45
NA,claims?,45
Mr KEATING,I am aware of the Queens-,45
NA,land Premier's comments. I regard it as a matter,45
NA,of great regret that so senior an Australian pol-,45
NA,itician should be driven to make the remarks he,45
NA,has. It highlights the double standards we have,45
NA,"had from the Queensland Premier to find that,",45
NA,in urging people to law and order and to obey,45
NA,"the rule of law, the only laws he feels he ought",45
NA,to be obeyed are his laws. I urge honourable,45
NA,members to remember his attitude two years ago,45
NA,when the Queensland coal companies tried to,45
NA,reduce the onerous burden of the $200m a year,45
NA,rail freight export taxes and the Premier's reply,45
NA,to them. I remind honourable members of his,45
NA,attitude towards Queensland motorists when hit,45
NA,by increases of up to 400 per cent in compulsory,45
NA,third party insurance. Those motorists were,45
NA,"threatened by the Premier, who abused every-",45
NA,body who said that they may not pay the,45
NA,increases.,45
NA,The other thing I found regrettable in the,45
NA,Premier's fulminations this morning was that he,45
NA,did not have the decency to indicate that the,45
NA,earnings of these revenue measures are totally,45
NA,revenue neutral to the Government and are all,45
NA,returned in lower marginal rates of tax. We,45
NA,heard nothing from the Queensland Premier,45
NA,about the reduction in the top marginal tax rate,45
NA,from 60 per cent to 49 per cent. We heard,45
NA,nothing from him about the removal of the,45
NA,double tax on dividends or the provision of the,45
NA,full imputation system for Australian business.,45
NA,The Premier has been fulminating about the cost,45
NA,to business of the fringe benefits tax but has,45
NA,failed to mention the provision of a full impu-,45
NA,"tation system, the second such system in the",45
NA,"world, at a company tax rate of 49 per cent and",45
NA,"not 65 per cent, and reductions in the top mar-",45
NA,"ginal rate from 60 per cent to 49 per cent and,",45
NA,"in the other step, 46 per cent and 48 per cent",45
NA,to 40 per cent. He did not have the decency to,45
NA,mention that. Of course the reason the Premier,45
NA,is concerned about the consequence of the tax,45
NA,upon the Queensland Public Service is obviously,45
NA,the size and the cost of Public Service fringe,45
NA,benefits in Queensland which State taxpayers are,45
NA,"being asked to bear. For instance, his own air-",45
NA,"craft, which costs $8m a year--",45
Mr GRIFFITHS ,How much?,45
Mr KEATING,"It costs $8m, but does not",45
NA,operate under rules like those applying to Royal,45
NA,"Australian Air Force aircraft. Secondly, it is",45
NA,known that there is a secret Public Service Board,45
NA,report circulating in Brisbane detailing the mas-,45
NA,sive abuse of fringe benefits in the Queensland,45
NA,Public Service. Three-quarters of government ve-,45
NA,hicles in Brisbane are used for no more than,45
NA,"transporting public servants to home and back,",45
NA,and of course the recent Australian Bureau of,45
NA,Statistics numbers emphasise the size of his pub-,45
NA,"lic sector in Queensland, which is running a",45
NA,1985-86 borrowing requirement of $1.615 billion.,45
NA,"When extrapolated to all of Australia, that is",45
NA,the equivalent of a Commonwealth borrowing,45
NA,requirement of a massive $10 billion-which of,45
NA,course is twice what the Commonwealth bor-,45
NA,rows. So that gives us some indication of the,45
NA,size of the public sector in Queensland. Yet this,45
NA,is from a Premier who is always urging everyone,45
NA,else to reduce the size of government. He has,45
NA,this whopping public sector deficit and borrow-,45
NA,ing requirement up there and has abused taxpay-,45
NA,"ers' funds by providing fringe benefits, on which",45
NA,he now has to pay the Commonwealth tax. To,45
NA,find that he is going about the place urging,45
NA,people to break the law when he has for years,45
NA,"urged everyone else to accept the rule of law,",45
NA,reserving to himself the right to abuse anyone,45
NA,"who dares not pay Queensland taxes, all rings",45
NA,rather hollow. Perhaps this is best summed up,45
NA,"by today's leader in the Brisbane Courier-Mail,",45
NA,"headed 'Facing the economic Truth', which, in",45
NA,"speaking about the Queensland economy, says:",45
NA,"Of course, there are lies, damned lies and statistics.",45
NA,But the Liberal Party in Queensland has produced a set,45
NA,"of economic indicators which suggest, rather forcibly,",45
NA,that the economy is in crisis. Queensland has the highest,45
NA,unemployment rate in mainland Australia and the low-,45
NA,"est number of tertiary education students. As well, the",45
NA,"State has had no increase in full-time employment, it is",45
NA,the only State where juvenile unemployment has in-,45
NA,"creased, the only State which has experienced a per-",45
NA,centage decrease in new housing starts and the lowest,45
NA,increase in new vehicle registrations.,45
NA,Other indicators are equally gloomy: Queensland has,45
NA,experienced the greatest percentage increase in bank-,45
NA,"ruptcies, the second worst decrease i!1 private capital",45
NA,investment and the greatest number of days lost through,45
NA,industrial disputes.,45
NA,"Of course, the Premier managed to produce his own",45
NA,set of statistics: Queensland has the highest growth rate,45
NA,"and the lowest State taxes. More importantly, however,",45
NA,he accused the Liberals of siding with Labor 'to knock,45
NA,"Queensland'. This is unfortunate, because it demon-",45
NA,strates a reluctance on the part of both the Premier and,45
NA,the Queensland Government to accept the facts before,45
NA,their eyes.,45
NA,The Courier-Mail has been known to be fairly,45
NA,supportive of the Premier in the past. This is a,45
NA,"damning indictment of his administration and,",45
NA,coming as it does on the heels of his urging of,45
NA,"well people to break the laws of the land, the Com-",45
NA,"monwealth laws, and saying that his own Gov-",45
NA,ernment will not pay the tax on the fringe,45
NA,benefits handed out willy-nilly by him and his,46
NA,"Ministers to their employees, gives the Queens-",46
NA,land public some indication of the kind of lead-,46
NA,ership and the morality of the leadership it is,46
NA,currently getting from the Queensland Premier.,46
Mr SHARP,Does the Minister for Health,46
NA,still hold the belief that he has expressed repeatFebruary.,46
NA,edly over a number of years that it is wrong for,46
NA,marihuana to be outlawed and that people should,46
NA,be allowed to grow marihuana in their own back,46
NA,yards? If the Minister believes in the legalising,46
NA,"of marihuana, how does he accommodate this",46
NA,with his position as the Government's Minister,46
NA,in charge of the drug offensive? Does he realise,46
NA,that by allowing people to grow cannabis plants,46
NA,in their own back yards he must be advocating,46
NA,the legislation of such hard drugs as hash and,46
NA,"hashish oil which, along with marihuana, are",46
NA,products of the cannabis plant?,46
Dr BLEWETT,In the past I have expressed,46
NA,views about the controversial issue of the decri-,46
NA,"minalisation of marihuana. However, as Health",46
NA,Minister of this country and as a member of the,46
NA,"Cabinet, I am bound to take into consideration",46
NA,the long term effects of marihuana on health.,46
NA,"Quite clearly, in the material that has been pre-",46
NA,pared under my authority in relation to the,46
NA,"national campaign against drug abuse, which the",46
NA,honourable member has used every opportunity,46
NA,"to denigrate, we have tried to provide people",46
NA,"with factual, realistic information about drugs.",46
NA,"We believe that, provided the correct informa-",46
NA,"tion is given throughout the campaign, that in-",46
NA,formation wiII be respected. In the material that,46
NA,"has been put out in relation to cannabis, we",46
NA,have pointed out the distinction between canna-,46
NA,"bis and some of the hard drugs, but at the same",46
NA,time we have recognised some of the long term,46
NA,effects on people's health of the use of cannabis.,46
NA,HOUSING: OPPOSITION POLICY,46
Mr LEE,My question is addressed to the,46
NA,Minister for Housing and Construction. What,46
NA,effect would the implementation of the Opposi-,46
NA,"tion's policy on housing and construction, as",46
NA,"announced yesterday, have on the housing indus-",46
NA,try and on first home buyers?,46
Mr WEST,When the Opposition policy doc-,46
NA,ument came into my hands for the first time last,46
NA,"night, I took some convincing that it was a",46
NA,genuine document. The document is so inept and,46
NA,shoddy in its presentation and so shallow in its,46
NA,content that it is hard to believe that a major,46
NA,political party in this country could actually put,46
NA,out such a poor and amateurish presentation,46
NA,with such shallow content. It has absolutely no,46
NA,costing and no figures whatsoever. One can look,46
NA,through the entire length of the document and,46
NA,nowhere is there to be found any consideration,46
NA,of the financial effects of the changes to policy,46
NA,that the Opposition suggests. It has all the hall-,46
NA,DRUGS marks of being put out in great panic. Each page,46
NA,is headed 'Draft Copy No.9' and dated 17,46
NA,This is the policy document that was,46
NA,put around the Press Gallery last night.,46
NA,As we now have the benefit of being able to,46
NA,"peruse Draft Copy No.9, dated 17 February,",46
NA,the obvious question that any interested observer,46
NA,would have to ask is: What have the Opposition,46
NA,and the torpid shadow Minister for Housing and,46
NA,Construction been doing since 17 February? It,46
NA,is pretty obvious that they believe that nothing,46
NA,much has happened in the area of housing since,46
NA,"17 February. There I was, sitting in my office,",46
NA,waiting for the phantom front bench leaker to,46
NA,"strike again, when suddenly my Press officer",46
NA,"rushed in and said: 'Minister, have a look at this",46
NA,dynamic document. We have an Opposition pol-,46
NA,icy document which is Draft Copy No. 9 and,46
NA,dated 17 February. It has just been released'.,46
NA,Let us have a look at the document and see,46
NA,what it says. The first thing we see--,46
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,46
Mr WEST ,"As I have said, it has all the",46
NA,hallmarks of being pushed out in panic. Honour-,46
NA,able members opposite really have some prob-,46
NA,"lems with leaks. By George, they have some",46
NA,problems with leaks. I hope that they can hunt,46
NA,down the culprit. Let us look at what the docu-,46
NA,ment proposes. The first thing the document sets,46
NA,out to do is to abolish the first home owners,46
NA,scheme. Let me explain what the first home,46
NA,owners scheme has achieved. Because it makes,46
NA,available a substantial lump sum and a continu-,46
NA,"ing interest rate subsidy, that scheme has made",46
NA,"it possible for 200,000 low and middle income",46
NA,earners to aspire to their own homes in this,46
NA,country. We have paid out-and have a com-,46
NA,mitment to payout over the next five years-,46
NA,"$900m already. Why, even in the electorate of",46
NA,the honourable member for Deakin an amount,46
NA,of $2.6m has been committed. In the electorate,46
NA,of Bennelong an amount of $1.5m has been paid,46
NA,"out, and-wait for it-we have paid out $6m in",46
NA,the electorate of New England. What has the,46
NA,National Party got to say about this attack on,46
NA,the low income aspirants to a home?,46
NA,I do not want to see Australia's working class,46
NA,home aspirants disadvantaged because of the ab-,46
NA,olition of the first home owners scheme. How-,46
NA,"ever, what do the right honourable member for",46
NA,New England and other members of the Na-,47
NA,tional Party have to say about the effect of this,47
NA,"on the rural poor in their own electorates when,",47
NA,"already, an amount of $6m has been allocated",47
NA,to low and middle income earners in the New,47
NA,England electorate as a result of this scheme?,47
NA,Do members of the National Party simply want,47
NA,to abolish the first home owners scheme?,47
NA,Let us look at what the policy document,47
NA,proposes in addition to this sabotage. It also,47
NA,out to eliminate the tied grants under the,47
NA,Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. Let,47
NA,us look at what the tied grants are. There are,47
NA,five tied grants. The first is the mortgage and,47
NA,rent relief scheme which was first implemented,47
NA,by the Fraser Government back in 1982 during,47
NA,its period of high interest rates. The mortgage,47
NA,and rent relief scheme does what its name im-,47
NA,plies and extends assistance to those who are in,47
NA,trouble in paying out their mortgage and meeting,47
NA,their rent requirement. The second tied program,47
NA,is the crisis accommodation program. Honoura-,47
NA,ble members opposite are going to abolish that,47
NA,program. This program makes short term accom-,47
NA,modation available to the poor and homeless.,47
NA,The third program the Opposition would set out,47
NA,to abolish is the local government and commu-,47
NA,nity housing program. Let us see what the Aus-,47
NA,tralian Association of Local Government,47
NA,Organisations and all the local government insti-,47
NA,tutions around Australia will have to say about,47
NA,this. Let us see what all the community housing,47
NA,organisations will have to say. The second last,47
NA,program which the Opposition proposes to abol-,47
NA,ish is the Aboriginal rental program. This is the,47
NA,special Aboriginal program for which we have,47
NA,increased funding by 60 per cent since we,47
NA,achieved office.,47
Mr SINCLAIR ,Wind up.,47
Mr WEST , The Opposition proposes to,47
NA,abolish the Aboriginal rental program. The fifth,47
NA,program that Opposition members propose to,47
NA,abolish when they abolish the tied grants is the,47
NA,pensioners rental program. The Opposition ought,47
NA,to be thoroughly ashamed that it could produce,47
NA,such a vicious document.,47
Mr SINCLAIR ,"On a point of order, Madam",47
NA,Speaker: I draw your attention to a practice that,47
NA,"the Minister, when in opposition, sought to can-",47
NA,vass frequently during the course of Questions,47
NA,"without Notice, and that is, if it is necessary",47
NA,a Minister to make a statement time will be,47
NA,provided in the Parliament for that statement to,47
NA,be debated. Questions without Notice are not,47
NA,for the purpose of giving a protracted explana-,47
NA,tion of this order. I suggest that it is about time,47
NA,that the Minister drew his answer to a close.,47
NA,Madam SPEAKER-Order! There is no point,47
NA,of order. I have pointed out to the House re-,47
NA,"peatedly that, if honourable members wish to",47
NA,limit the time that a Minister takes to answer a,47
NA,"question, they may do so through the House of",47
NA,Representatives Standing Committee on Proce-,47
NA,dure. The Chair has no authority to limit the,47
NA,sets time. The Chair can ask only that the Minister,47
NA,be relevant.,47
Mr WEST,The Opposition ought to be,47
NA,ashamed that it has kept its supporters waiting,47
NA,for 18 months and then has come out with a,47
NA,policy that is so poor in its presentation and so,47
NA,shallow in its content. The Opposition requires,47
NA,a really good shakeup to get rid of the current,47
NA,batch of dullards and loafers who make up its,47
NA,"front bench, which can produce such an atro-",47
NA,"cious, foul and despicable document that it hopes",47
NA,to pass off as a housing policy document.,47
NA,MAINTENANCE PAYMENTS,47
Mr MACKELLAR,I ask the Minister for So-,47
NA,cial Security. Does the Government intend to,47
NA,deduct at source court-directed maintenance,47
NA,payments from the incomes of defaulting non-,47
NA,custodial parents?,47
Mr HOWE,I thank the honourable member,47
NA,for his question because it is an important issue,47
NA,"for this Parliament and is certainly relevant, as",47
NA,"the Minister for Finance said yesterday, to the",47
NA,care of children of sole parents. Every honoura-,47
NA,ble member will know that the children of pen-,47
NA,"sion beneficiary families, particularly the children",47
NA,"of sole parent families, are the poorest children",47
NA,in the Australian community today. One of the,47
NA,disturbing things that have occurred in the dis-,47
NA,cussion that has taken place around Australia,47
NA,"on this issue, particularly on the part-as Sena-",47
NA,tor Walsh said yesterday-of the National Party,47
NA,"of Australia rednecks, has been the suggestion",47
NA,that somehow the responsibility for this poverty,47
NA,lies very much with the 90 per cent of support-,47
NA,"ing parents who are women, with little or no",47
NA,attention being given to the fact that liable par-,47
NA,"ents, the vast majority of whom clearly are men,",47
NA,are not taking the responsibility that they ought,47
NA,to take to maintain at a reasonable level the,47
NA,children for whom they have responsibility.,47
NA,The Government has had this matter under,47
NA,for consideration for a period and hopes to resolve,47
NA,its approach to it in the lead-up to this year's,47
NA,Budget. We are looking at a number of alterna-,47
NA,"tives, including the national maintenance collec-",47
NA,tion agency approach which was the subject of,47
NA,a Government report. We have been looking,48
NA,also at the New Zealand liable parents contri-,48
NA,bution scheme. Last week I was in New Zealand,48
NA,and had discussions with the Minister for Social,48
NA,Welfare and had the opportunity to talk to,48
NA,people in New Zealand about that scheme. We,48
NA,are looking also at some other alternatives which,48
NA,would include that which was implied in the,48
NA,"question; that is, the withdrawal of income at",48
NA,source. Whatever is the outcome of these delib-,48
NA,"erations, we have a situation in which there is",48
NA,great poverty. We believe that people ought to,48
NA,be brought to account on the question of indi-,48
NA,vidual responsibility and that the Federal Gov-,48
NA,ernment ought to take the lead in this matter.,48
NA,"I cannot say any more than that, except that",48
NA,I believe this is a very important issue. I know,48
NA,that there have been some very interesting de-,48
NA,bates in the Senate. I hope that when the Gov-,48
NA,ernment is able to bring back a report to the,48
NA,"House we will be able to get very broad support,",48
NA,in particular from those outspoken members of,48
NA,the National Party who have suggested that there,48
NA,are matters of individual responsibility in this,48
NA,area. I hope also that all members of parliament,48
NA,will consider the issues when the Government,48
NA,"has determined its position, because this matter",48
NA,is extremely important to the Australian,48
NA,community.,48
NA,SOLOMON ISLANDS,48
Mr MILDREN,I direct the attention of the,48
NA,Minister representing the Acting Minister for,48
NA,Foreign Affairs to the appalling loss of life and,48
NA,destruction of property in the Solomon Islands,48
NA,in the wake of Cyclone Namu. Will the Minister,48
NA,indicate the most recent information on the sit-,48
NA,uation in the Solomon Islands? Will he also,48
NA,indicate what action the Australian Government,48
NA,has taken to provide emergency relief measures,48
NA,in the devastated areas and what information he,48
NA,has regarding the safety of Australians in the,48
NA,"Solomon Islands? Finally, will he indicate",48
NA,whether the Government would be prepared to,48
NA,support community groups should they organise,48
NA,disaster relief appeals for the victims of Cyclone,48
NA,Namu?,48
Mr BARRY JONES,Following an improve-,48
NA,"ment in the weather on 21 May, the Solomon",48
NA,Islands Government began assessing the damage.,48
NA,A further assessment of the situation will take,48
NA,"some time. To date, 71 deaths have been re-",48
NA,ported but there is as yet no official confirma-,48
NA,tion. The latest information available indicates,48
NA,that the magnitude of devastation is far greater,48
NA,"than originally estimated and that at least 90,000",48
NA,"people are homeless. The Prime Minister, in his",48
NA,"message to the Solomon Islands Prime Minister,",48
NA,has given an assurance that Australia will con-,48
NA,tinue to do all that it can to assist in this hour,48
NA,of crisis. At the request of the Solomon Islands,48
NA,"Government, Australia is providing relief assist-",48
NA,"ance in the form of helicopters with winches,",48
NA,"shelter materials, water containers, first-aid ma-",48
NA,"terial, food-particularly rice-a generator and",48
NA,"other electrical equipment, blankets and cooking",48
NA,utensils. Three Australian Hercules transport,48
NA,flights have already arrived in Honiara from,48
NA,Australia and a fourth and fifth Hercules are on,48
NA,their way to Honiara with additional supplies.,48
NA,An Australian airport engineer has been airlifted,48
NA,to Honiara to assist in assessing airport condi-,48
NA,tions. A Caribou aircraft left Townsville for,48
NA,Honiara this morning to assist in the distribution,48
NA,of supplies in the outer islands.,48
NA,Early next week additional Royal Australian,48
NA,"Air Force aircraft will be required, and the",48
NA,defence forces will respond as required. The,48
NA,Royal Australian Navy is preparing to send two,48
NA,"vessels-HMAS Flinders, which we hope will",48
NA,"arrive shortly after the weekend, and HMAS",48
NA,"Stalwart, which will arrive early next week-",48
NA,with a large volume of supplies. The emergency,48
NA,relief assistance to the Solomon Islands is co-,48
NA,ordinated by the Australian Development Assist-,48
NA,ance Bureau in collaboration with the Australian,48
NA,Natural Disasters Organisation. They are in con-,48
NA,stant touch with the Australian High Commis-,48
NA,"sioner in Honiara. Until now, all requests of the",48
NA,Australian Government by the Solomon Islands,48
NA,"Government have been met, and the Australian",48
NA,Government will respond as required. The High,48
NA,Commissioner advises that all Australians in,48
NA,Honiara are safe but contact with outer islands,48
NA,is still difficult. I will seek what advice I can,48
NA,about the relationship of private donor organi-,48
NA,"sations but, naturally, this is a community re-",48
NA,sponsibility. It cannot just be a government,48
NA,matter. I am sure that this is something which,48
NA,has the full support of all parties in the House.,48

NA,In particular those promises relate to the following,49

NA,"I. That within three years of its election to office, a",49

NA,That deterioration of the total global environment is,49
NA,continuing at an increasing rate; that important environ-,49
NA,"mental resources vital to human livelihood such as trees,",49

NA,that the magnitude of devastation is far greater,50
NA,"than originally estimated and that at least 90,000",50
NA,"people are homeless. The Prime Minister, in his",50
NA,"message to the Solomon Islands Prime Minister,",50
NA,has given an assurance that Australia will con-,50
NA,tinue to do all that it can to assist in this hour,50
NA,of crisis. At the request of the Solomon Islands,50
NA,"Government, Australia is providing relief assist-",50
NA,"ance in the form of helicopters with winches,",50
NA,"shelter materials, water containers, first-aid ma-",50
NA,"terial, food-particularly rice-a generator and",50
NA,"other electrical equipment, blankets and cooking",50
NA,utensils. Three Australian Hercules transport,50
NA,flights have already arrived in Honiara from,50
NA,Australia and a fourth and fifth Hercules are on,50
NA,their way to Honiara with additional supplies.,50
NA,An Australian airport engineer has been airlifted,50
NA,to Honiara to assist in assessing airport condi-,50
NA,tions. A Caribou aircraft left Townsville for,50
NA,Honiara this morning to assist in the distribution,50
NA,of supplies in the outer islands.,50
NA,Early next week additional Royal Australian,50
NA,"Air Force aircraft will be required, and the",50
NA,defence forces will respond as required. The,50
NA,Royal Australian Navy is preparing to send two,50
NA,"vessels-HMAS Flinders, which we hope will",50
NA,"arrive shortly after the weekend, and HMAS",50
NA,"Stalwart, which will arrive early next week-",50
NA,with a large volume of supplies. The emergency,50
NA,relief assistance to the Solomon Islands is co-,50
NA,ordinated by the Australian Development Assist-,50
NA,ance Bureau in collaboration with the Australian,50
NA,Natural Disasters Organisation. They are in con-,50
NA,stant touch with the Australian High Commis-,50
NA,"sioner in Honiara. Until now, all requests of the",50
NA,Australian Government by the Solomon Islands,50
NA,"Government have been met, and the Australian",50
NA,Government will respond as required. The High,50
NA,Commissioner advises that all Australians in,50
NA,Honiara are safe but contact with outer islands,50
NA,is still difficult. I will seek what advice I can,50
NA,about the relationship of private donor organi-,50
NA,"sations but, naturally, this is a community re-",50
NA,sponsibility. It cannot just be a government,50
NA,matter. I am sure that this is something which,50
NA,has the full support of all parties in the House.,50

NA,Discussion of Matter of Public Importance,59
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Leo Mc-,59
NA,Leay)-Madam Speaker has received a letter,59
NA,from the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr How-,59
NA,ard) proposing that a definite matter of public,59
NA,importance be submitted to the House for dis-,59
NA,"cussion, namely:",59
NA,The destructive impact of the Government's capital,59
NA,gains and fringe benefits tax proposals on the productive,59

NA,State I call upon those members who approve of the,59
NA,proposed discussion to rise in their places.,59
NA,More than the number of members required,59
NA,the unby the Standing Orders having risen in their,59
NA,places-,59
Dr THEOPHANOUS ,"I raise a point of order, Mr",59
NA,Deputy Speaker. I refer you to standing order,59
NA,"House 82, which specifies that no member may antici-",59
NA,pate the discussion of any subject which appears,59
NA,"on the Notice Paper. In fact, we have on the",59
NA,pray. Notice Paper the capital gains tax Bills. The fact,59
NA,is that they will be discussed and debated. One,59
NA,speech has already been made on those Bills. It,59
NA,would seem to me that this is precisely the kind,59
NA,of point which was intended when the standing,59
NA,"order was formulated, that is, the question of",59
NA,whether--,59
Mr CADMAN ,It is a frivolous point of order.,59
Dr THEOPHANOUS ,"It is not frivolous at all, it",59
NA,is an important point. Capital gains tax will be,59
NA,"debated next week. Therefore I ask you, Mr",59
NA,"Deputy Speaker, to rule that this discussion,",59
NA,"especially the aspect on capital gains tax, is out",59
NA,of order.,59
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Leo Mc-,59
NA,pray. Leay)-It has been the practice of the House to,59
NA,allow debate on the matter of public importance,59
NA,because that has been determined to be a discus-,59
NA,"sion rather than a debate. Standing order 82,",59
NA,"however, does say that no member may antici-",59
NA,National Flag pate the discussion of any subject which appears,59
NA,on the Notice Paper.,59
Mr HOWARD ,It would be impossible to antic-,59
NA,"ipate what you said, Andrew.",59
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,The Leader of the,60
NA,"Opposition might listen to the Chair. However,",60
NA,"the standing order goes on ""to say that regard",60
NA,shall be had by the Speaker to the probability,60
NA,of the matter anticipated being brought before,60
NA,the House within a reasonable time. My recol-,60
NA,"lection last night, when the Treasurer ( Mr Keat-",60
NA,"ing) introduced these Bills, was that he said they",60
NA,would be debated next week. Notwithstanding,60
NA,"that, it has been the practice of the House to",60
NA,allow discussions on matters of public impor-,60
NA,tance. There may be some relevance in the hon-,60
NA,ourable member's point of order and I will draw,60
NA,the substance of it to the attention of Madam,60
NA,"Speaker, but I will allow the debate to continue.",60
NA,"Mr SincIair-I raise two points of order, Mr",60
NA,"Deputy Speaker. First, I draw your attention to",60
NA,the fact that perhaps the time might start for,60
NA,the Leader of the Opposition as of the time he,60
NA,"commences speaking. Secondly, I suggest to you",60
NA,that any matter that is accepted by Madam,60
NA,Speaker as a matter of public importance has in,60
NA,fact been ruled on at the time of that,60
NA,determination.,60
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,There is no point,60
NA,"of order, as the Leader of the National Party",60
NA,knows full well. If the Leader of the National,60
NA,Party had been listening he would have heard,60
NA,that I called the honourable member for Cal well,60
NA,before I called the Leader of the Opposition.,60
NA,The Leader of the Opposition's time shall start,60
NA,from when I call him. If he rises I will probably,60
NA,call him now.,60
Mr HOWARD ,Bennelong-Leader of the,60
NA,"Opposition) (3.00)-Well, one never knows when",60
NA,"one's luck is in. However, Mr Deputy Speaker,",60
NA,I think it is fair to say that the whole political,60
NA,and economic debate in this country was dra-,60
NA,matically changed last week when the Treasurer,60
NA,( Mr Keating) made his now famous statement,60
NA,"about this country becoming a banana republic,",60
NA,a statement that will in time become not a,60
NA,famous or memorable statement but one of the,60
NA,more infamous statements that have been made,60
NA,by a senior Minister in a government in this,60
NA,country.,60
NA,Now that we are at the end of the first week,60
NA,that Parliament has sat since that statement was,60
NA,"made, I think it is a matter of regret to record",60
NA,that in the four days we have sat that no serious,60
NA,attempt has been made by the Treasurer or any,60
NA,other member of the Government to take the,60
NA,state of the Australian economy seriously. The,60
NA,Treasurer has not sought leave to make a state-,60
NA,ment about the condition of the Australian econ-,60
NA,omy; to tell the people of Australia why he,60
NA,believes we might be becoming a banana repub-,60
NA,lic; and to tell the Australian people why he,60
NA,thought it necessary to use words of panic and,60
NA,alarm that had a damaging effect on this coun-,60
NA,try's international economic reputation and,60
NA,caused serious financial loss to the holders of,60
NA,assets of Australian currency. He has made no,60
NA,attempt at all to come into this Parliament and,60
NA,do that in the four days that we have sat. We,60
NA,would have facilitated a full-scale debate on the,60
NA,economy.,60
NA,"Rather than do that, the Treasurer has re-",60
NA,"sorted to cheap abuse, cheap jibes, trivial re-",60
NA,sponses and a totally inadequate and,60
NA,inconsequential treatment of the economic prob-,60
NA,lems of this country. I charge that the Treasurer,60
NA,of this country is not taking our current eco-,60
NA,nomic problems seriously; he is not taking the,60
NA,Parliament seriously; he is not taking his duties,60
NA,as Treasurer seriously; and he is certainly not,60
NA,taking seriously the consequences of the policies,60
NA,that his Government is visiting upon the Austra-,60
NA,lian people and different sections of the Austra-,60
NA,lian community.,60
NA,"It is manifest, and has been manifest for a",60
NA,"long time, that this country does have serious",60
NA,"economic difficulties. I honestly believed that,",60
NA,"inept though his words were, when the Treasurer",60
NA,made his statement 10 days ago he was about to,60
NA,address himself seriously to the problems that,60
NA,we have. I fully expected that he would make a,60
NA,"full statement when the Parliament resumed,",60
NA,that he would tell the Australian public where,60
NA,"he stood, that he would tell the public what he",60
NA,"had in mind for it, and that we would have an",60
NA,opportunity to debate this matter. But the reality,60
NA,"is that, having sounded the alarm, he has done",60
NA,absolutely nothing about it. The reason he has,60
NA,done nothing about it is that the Government,60
NA,cannot make up its mind as to what it is going,60
NA,to do.,60
NA,We have had a classic example of such behav-,60
NA,iour this week. One could almost say that over,60
NA,the last week the Australian ship of state has hit,60
NA,economic rocks and is taking in quite a lot of,60
NA,water. The captain abandoned ship. He flew,60
NA,north and he blamed his officers. The Treasurer,60
NA,ran around the deck causing panic and then,60
NA,decided to have a summit to see whether anyone,60
NA,knew where the lifejackets were stowed. The,60
NA,"Acting Prime Minister, the Attorney-General ( Mr",60
NA,"Lionel Bowen), pulled the cap over his eyes and",60
NA,told the passengers that the poopdeck summit,60
NA,was merely to check the charts. Senator Button,60
NA,said that the ship had been badly holed and,60
NA,would hit more rocks on the way to the bottom.,60
NA,"Finally, of course, we had temper tantrums and",61
NA,a threat from the north from the Telecom tyrant,61
NA,as the captain started to get interested in some,61
NA,"salvage rights. But the Acting Prime Minister,",61
NA,"ever dependable, came running in and said that",61
NA,the telephone hook-up was just a pleasant dis-,61
NA,cussion as the captain had just called to say: 'I,61
NA,love you all'. There has not been the serious,61
NA,addressing of the country's economic problems,61
NA,that we might have expected from this Treasurer,61
NA,"or from the Acting Prime Minister. Rather, we",61
NA,have had a low grade farce. We have been given,61
NA,a totally inadequate response. The Government,61
NA,has no coherent plan. It has no idea and it has,61
NA,no coherent recognition of what is now needed,61
NA,seriously to address the economic problems of,61
NA,this country.,61
NA,The reality is that all of the warnings made,61
NA,by the Opposition about the Government's poli-,61
NA,"cies over the last two years have come true, one",61
NA,by one. It is like the old story of nine green,61
NA,bottles hanging on the wall-one by one they all,61
NA,fall. One by one the warnings of the Opposi-,61
NA,tion-the warnings that people could not believe,61
NA,the Government-have certainly come true. We,61
NA,all remember the ringing promises: There will be,61
NA,no capital gains tax. Is it not prophetic that the,61
NA,week the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) is cud-,61
NA,"dling pandas in the provinces of China, his",61
NA,Treasurer introduces a Bill which breaks the,61
NA,most solemn and ringing promise made by the,61
NA,Prime Minister in the 1983 election campaign.,61
NA,This apology for a Treasurer will come in here,61
NA,and talk about people having no shame. Mem-,61
NA,bers on the Government front bench can have,61
NA,"no shame, given the number of promises they",61
NA,have broken. Not only was our warning that,61
NA,people could not believe the Government vindi-,61
NA,cated; when the Australian dollar was floated in,61
NA,"December 1983, on behalf of the Opposition I",61
NA,said that the floating of the dollar was a very,61
NA,sensible move-I have never resiled from my,61
NA,praise for the Government's decision to float the,61
NA,Australian dollar-but warned:,61
NA,"Now that the dollar has, quite properly, been floated,",61
NA,"the Government can no longer ""fudge"" the exchange",61
NA,rate in order to protect it from the consequences of,61
NA,"inappropriate and irresponsible domestic fiscal, mone-",61
NA,tary and wages policies.,61
NA,The dollar float imposes a new discipline on the,61
NA,Government.,61
NA,Of course that is a discipline which it has been,61
NA,manifestly unable to meet. That is not the end,61
NA,of the matter. We warned the Government about,61
NA,the balance of payments problem. Month after,61
NA,month as the J-curve failed to arrive Opposition,61
NA,spokesmen said that the theory was wrong and,61
NA,that ultimately the Government would have to,61
NA,acknowledge that. Month after month the Treas-,61
NA,"urer said: 'No, everything is just around the",61
NA,corner. Just have faith for another month. Be-,61
NA,lieve me for another month and everything will,61
NA,come right'. All of that came to grief last week,61
NA,and the Treasurer finally had to admit it.,61
NA,The greatest demonstration of the way in,61
NA,"which this man has misled the Australian public,",61
NA,the way in which he has deceived the Australian,61
NA,"public, about the condition of the Australian",61
NA,economy is his pathetic attempt to say that our,61
NA,real problem is that we have lousy terms of,61
NA,trade. That has been as plain as a pikestaff for,61
NA,"at least eight or nine months, perhaps longer.",61
NA,He admitted in the House yesterday that the,61
NA,terms of trade had dramatically deteriorated from,61
NA,October 1985. Yet do we find any reference at,61
NA,all to our terms of trade in the 600 pages of,61
NA,submission to the Australian Conciliation and,61
NA,Arbitration Commission at the current produc-,61
NA,"tivity hearing? In other words, the most grievous",61
NA,problem with our economy is considered to be,61
NA,"so irrelevant, so inconsequential and so unwor-",61
NA,thy of mention that there is absolutely no serious,61
NA,reference to it in the submission. It was only,61
NA,after the Treasurer was flushed out by the Op-,61
NA,position earlier this week that he weakly came,61
NA,into the House yesterday and said: 'We have,61
NA,presented some new material to the Arbitration,61
NA,"Commission, not last October, not three weeks",61
NA,"ago but today, so please forgive us. Don't, for",61
NA,"heaven's sake, hold us to account'. The Treas-",61
NA,urer misled the Arbitration Commission and the,61
NA,Australian public. If the terms of trade have,61
"been dramatically deteriorating, Mr KEATING ",-,61
Mr HODGMAN , Mr Cheating.,61
Mr HOWARD, Mr Cheating should have,61
NA,gone to the Arbitration Commission when he,61
NA,first made his submission. No wonder he is earn-,61
NA,ing the very dubious title of being a very decep-,61
NA,tive Treasurer.,61
NA,The list goes on. We warned about the need,61
NA,for wage flexibility. Month after month the Gov-,61
NA,ernment said that we did not need that. We,61
NA,warned about the need for full discounting and,61
NA,about the unaffordability of the productivity case.,61
NA,Bit by bit the Government is being dragged,61
NA,screaming to a realisation that we cannot afford,61
NA,that productivity case this year if we are to,61
NA,restore our international competitiveness. How-,61
NA,"ever, in the face of all of this, the most impor-",61
NA,tant thing for this Parliament and the country,61
NA,to recognise is that we do have major economic,61
NA,problems and that those economic problems will,61
NA,not be solved unless the productive sector of the,61
NA,Australian economy is given a fairer go. That is,62
NA,the point of our charge today: The new capital,62
NA,gain!\. tax and the fringe benefits tax are a direct,62
NA,attack on the productive sectors of the Austra-,62
NA,"lian community. It is, therefore, no wonder that",62
NA,a bush fire of resentment is spreading throughout,62
NA,the business community as a result of the intro-,62
NA,duction of the fringe benefits tax.,62
NA,The Treasurer can rant and rave as much as,62
NA,he likes about tax avoidance. The old excuse for,62
NA,"the introduction of any kind of bullheaded, blunt",62
NA,instrument by the Australian Labor Party is to,62
NA,scream 'tax avoidance!'. The reality is that the,62
NA,introduction of the fringe benefits tax will give,62
NA,to this country the most un competitive corporate,62
NA,tax structure in the Western world. Not only do,62
NA,we now have a very uncompetitive tax structure,62
NA,"but also this Treasurer, this man who talks un-",62
NA,"endingly about profits, will make it much worse.",62
NA,This country will have a tax structure which will,62
NA,make it much harder for our sorely pressed,62
NA,manufacturing industry to compete with imports.,62
Dr THEOPHANOUS ,Rubbish!,62
NA,Mr HOWARDI am delighted that my friend,62
NA,has come in and said 'Rubbish'. Let me read,62
NA,"him some of the tax rates. After this year, when",62
NA,"we take into account the fringe benefits tax,",62
NA,many corporations in this country will be paying,62
NA,an effective tax rate of 54 or 55 per cent.,62
NA,Mr Rocher-How much?,62
Mr HOWARD,They will be paying 54 or,62
NA,55 per cent. That is what Australian companies,62
NA,will have to pay. Let us consider the rates with,62
NA,"which they have to compete: In Malaysia, 40",62
NA,"per cent; Singapore, 40 per cent; the United",62
NA,"Kingdom, 35 per cent; the United States of",62
NA,"America, currently 46 per cent, but proposed to",62
NA,"go down to 43 per cent; Japan, 43 per cent; and",62
NA,"Canada, 30 per cent for manufacturing or proc-",62
NA,essing and 36 per cent for other sectors of the,62
NA,Australian economy. And this character talks,62
NA,about the profit share! I remind him that the,62
NA,profit share is the operating surplus of a corpo-,62
NA,ration before we take into account taxation and,62
NA,interest charges. When we take into account,62
NA,"taxation and interest charges in this country, any",62
NA,reference to the profit share as a decent measure,62
NA,of how the Australian economy is performing is,62
NA,an absolute nonsense. The real sting in what the,62
NA,Government is doing is illustrated by the ludi-,62
NA,crous examples that are emerging day by day as,62
NA,people read the fringe benefits tax information,62
NA,booklet. I think one can fairly say that the fringe,62
NA,benefits tax guide could well prove to be the,62
NA,political epitaph of this Treasurer. I can tell the,62
NA,Treasurer that that booklet will do more politi-,62
NA,cal damage to him than any other booklet that,62
NA,any Australian Treasurer has ever authorised.,62
NA,All I can say is that the more of these booklets,62
NA,the Treasurer can distribute the better because,62
NA,the more people who understand what he is,62
NA,"about and how niggardly, how stupid, how in-",62
NA,sensitive and how commercially unreal the pro-,62
NA,"posed fringe benefits tax is, the better.",62
NA,Let us go through the list of examples. Hon-,62
NA,ourable members should listen to this one: A,62
NA,farm worker chops down wood for heating his,62
NA,"family in their farm cottage, using a number of",62
NA,dead trees on the farmer's property. That is,62
NA,caught by the fringe benefits tax. Do honourable,62
NA,members know what else is caught? When a,62
NA,farm worker uses a farm vehicle to drive his,62
NA,"children to the school bus stop, that is caught. I",62
NA,interjected on the Treasurer the other day and,62
NA,talked about a clergyman owning a car. He said:,62
NA,'Religious bodies are exempt. That is not caught'.,62
NA,But they are not exempt so far as private use is,62
NA,concerned-not at all. The attitude of those,62
NA,opposite is that they have to get them. I suppose,62
NA,the Treasurer will get up and say that that is,62
NA,some kind of tax avoidance.,62
NA,Do honourable members know that under the,62
NA,"capital gains tax legislation, despite all the pro-",62
NA,"testations of the Treasurer, one finds a form of",62
NA,death duty? If somebody leaves some assets to a,62
NA,"tax exempt body, normally a religious body or a",62
NA,"charity, do honourable members know who will",62
NA,bear the tax on that? It will be the estate of the,62
NA,deceased person. Yet the Treasurer will have the,62
NA,audacity to say that the legislation does not,62
NA,really contain any kind of death duty. The real-,62
NA,"ity is that day after day, as the knowledge of",62
NA,the fringe benefits tax spreads throughout the,62
NA,"Australian community, as we realise how com-",62
NA,"mercially insensitive and unreal the tax is, what",62
NA,an enormous burden it will be on the still over-,62
NA,"burdened corporate sector in this country, and",62
NA,that at a time when Australian industry is,62
NA,screaming for competitiveness it has a Treasurer,62
NA,"who is destined to make it more uncompetitive,",62
NA,I can say only that in reality the fringe benefits,62
NA,tax booklet will become the great political epi-,62
NA,taph of the present Treasurer of Australia.,62
Mr KEATING ,BlaxlandTreasurer),62
NA,"(3.20)- Mr Deputy Speaker, the Leader of the",62
NA,Opposition ( Mr Howard) will need something,62
NA,to help him because if he cannot lay a glove on,62
NA,the Government this week he never will. The,62
NA,fact is he could not beat time and we all know,62
NA,"it, including those behind him. He will need lots",62
NA,of books to help him because the fact of the,62
NA,matter is he is politically helpless and hopeless.,62
NA,The faces of his supporters show full well that,63
NA,that is exactly right. He will not be around for,63
NA,long. We heard about the little cabal of the,63
NA,NA,63
NA,up in the--,63
Mr CADMAN ,"You are a spiv, Paul. You are",63
NA,nothing but a spiv.,63
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! The hon-,63
NA,ourable member for Mitchell will cease walking,63
NA,around the chamber interjecting. He will resume,63
NA,his seat and will listen in silence.,63
Mr KEATING,I ask that the remark be,63
NA,withdrawn.,63
Mr CADMAN ,You couldn't get a job in a,63
NA,gravel pit.,63
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,The honourable,63
NA,member will not defy the Chair. He will cease,63
NA,interjecting.,63
Mr CADMAN ,I am responding to his remarks.,63
NA,He couldn't get a job in a gravel pit.,63
Mr KEATING,I ask that the remark be,63
NA,withdrawn.,63
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Did the honoura-,63
NA,ble member for Mitchell make an unparliamen-,63
NA,tary remark?,63
Mr KEATING,He did.,63
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,The Chair did not,63
NA,"hear the remark, but the Treasurer has asked",63
NA,that it be withdrawn.,63
Mr CADMAN ,I said that the Treasurer could,63
NA,not get a job in a gravel pit. The fact is he,63
NA,sacked from one.,63
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,As I understand,63
NA,"it, the honourable member for Mitchell, when",63
NA,"walking across the chamber, called the Treasurer",63
NA,a spiv. That is unparliamentary. I do not think,63
NA,that saying the Treasurer could not get a job in,63
NA,a gravel pit is unparliamentary. If the honoura-,63
NA,ble member did use those words which I thought,63
NA,"I heard him use, he will withdraw.",63
Mr CADMAN ,I suggest that on all of these,63
NA,occasions you refer to the Clerks when your,63
NA,hearing fails you.,63
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,I am asking you,63
NA,to withdraw.,63
Mr CADMAN ,I withdraw.,63
Mr KEATING,I will get to the point of this,63
NA,matter of public importance. It was supposed to,63
NA,be about capital gains taxation but it was a,63
NA,diatribe on the economy. The fact of the matter,63
NA,"is, after going through this range of so-called",63
NA,"economic points, the Leader of the Opposition",63
NA,ended up saying that he has always supported,63
NA,the float and gave the Government due credit,63
NA,for it but in his speech to the National Press,63
NA,Club he said that the greatest policy failure of,63
NA,the Government was that the depreciation of,63
NA,the dollar had reduced living standards. If the,63
NA,"float was not going to provide depreciation, what",63
NA,was it there for? This is the sort of stuff we get,63
NA,every day from the Leader of the Opposition.,63
NA,The fact is that on a national accounts basis,63
NA,we know that the profitability of Australian cor-,63
NA,"porations, the gross operating surplus of trading",63
NA,"companies, has risen by $8t billion, or 48 per",63
NA,"cent, in the last two years. In the last two years",63
NA,of the administration of the Leader of the Op-,63
NA,position it rose by $1 billion-$1 billion com-,63
NA,pared to $8t billion. He cried crocodile tears,63
NA,about the state of Australian business taxation.,63
NA,The coalition had a 7 per cent growth in profits,63
NA,with 24 per cent inflation and over the same,63
NA,period with 14 per cent inflation we have had a,63
NA,48 per cent growth in profits. So he should not,63
NA,make stupid speeches about companies and prof-,63
NA,its because every company in Australia knows,63
NA,that those in the Opposition were as incompe-,63
NA,tent as a government as they are as an opposition.,63
NA,Against this enormous increase in profits the,63
NA,Leader of the Opposition talked about a few,63
NA,hundred million in the fringe benefits tax as if,63
NA,on the one hand the Government's policies can,63
NA,provide $8t billion but on the other hand a,63
NA,couple of hundred million going the other way,63
NA,is a national calamity. Of course he forgot to,63
NA,was mention the 5:3 depreciation which this Govern-,63
NA,ment has provided business and which is costing,63
NA,$2 billion a year in accelerated depreciation. He,63
NA,forgot to mention the group loss provisions which,63
NA,this Government introduced for business. He,63
NA,forgot to mention the 150 per cent tax deduction,63
NA,for research and development that is likely to,63
NA,cost over $100m a year. He forgot to mention,63
NA,"the major corporate reform of full imputation,",63
NA,"the removal of the double tax on dividends, and",63
NA,the abolition of Division 7 tax that will cost,63
NA,$250m. All of that was forgotten in the one-,63
NA,"eyed, one-sided presentation we heard just a few",63
NA,minutes ago from the Leader of the Opposition.,63
NA,The Leader of the Opposition spoke of the,63
NA,couple of hundred million dollars in fringe ben-,63
NA,"efits tax, but he ignored the $8.5 billion increase",63
NA,"in profits, the full imputation system, the 5:3",63
NA,"depreciation, group losses, and the faster write-",63
NA,off for investment in research and development.,63
NA,He focused on just one thing. Who does the,63
NA,Leader of the Opposition think will be fooled by,63
NA,that? He ignored the total deregulation of the,63
NA,"financial system, the steel plan, the motor vehi-",64
NA,cle plan and the rural package. He ignored the,64
NA,assistance to other industries. As if that sort of,64
NA,hollow attempt to try to make some pathetic,64
NA,case out of a fringe benefits tax which should,64
NA,have been applied 20 years ago under a coalition,64
NA,government to stop people from paying less than,64
NA,their fair share of taxation would cut any ice.,64
NA,"After seven years in office, after seven years of",64
NA,tax disgrace on an international scale brought to,64
NA,"the head of the coalition Government, honoura-",64
NA,ble members opposite now talk about the im-,64
NA,morality of a fringe benefits tax whose modest,64
NA,objective is to make people pay their fair share,64
NA,of tax.,64
NA,The fact is that business in this country is,64
NA,massively better off under the Labor Govern-,64
NA,"ment's policies, and everyone knows it. Honour-",64
NA,able members should not take my word for it.,64
NA,The best guide to how the market thinks the,64
NA,Government's policies are going is the all ordi-,64
NA,naries index. The market is obviously not getting,64
NA,"a boost from the rest of the world, because the",64
NA,rest of the world has given us a massive current,64
NA,"account deficit. It has dropped prices on us, so",64
NA,there is no boost there. Where does the all,64
NA,"ordinaries index stand? It stands at 1,100. Where",64
NA,was it in 1983 under the Leader of the Opposi-,64
NA,tion? It stood at 500. The all ordinaries index of,64
NA,the Australian stock exchanges is twice as strong,64
NA,as a result of the domestic policies of the Hawke,64
NA,Labor Government. That is the judgment of the,64
NA,"level of corporate support for this Government,",64
NA,not some phoney speech manufactured by a failed,64
NA,Treasurer and by a group of people who could,64
NA,not possibly decipher what a decent policy is.,64
NA,The judgment is made where people vote with,64
NA,their feet-in the market and in the stock ex-,64
NA,"changes, which have given the thumbs down to",64
NA,the Opposition policies and the thumbs up to,64
NA,the policies of the Labor Government.,64
NA,The fact is that this Government has more,64
NA,than doubled the value of the Australian stock,64
NA,exchanges. It has more than doubled the value,64
NA,of the Australian assets in those exchanges. It,64
NA,has lifted the profitability of Australian business,64
NA,by a massive $8.5 billion. The Opposition is,64
NA,shedding crocodile tears because we will stop,64
NA,people having free lunches at the expense of,64
NA,other taxpayers or we will stop people driving,64
NA,cars for their private use at the expense of other,64
NA,taxpayers. In some way it sees that as a tax,64
NA,atrocity. That is the level of the moral bank-,64
NA,ruptcy of the present Opposition. That gives one,64
NA,some idea of the sorts of standards that would,64
NA,apply if honourable members opposite were to,64
NA,govern again from the treasury bench. That is,64
NA,why the public is quite smart. It will leave,64
NA,honourable members opposite right where they,64
NA,"are, in opposition, cackling away at Question",64
NA,"Time and guffawing to themselves, happily in",64
NA,"opposition, with no responsibility, no sense, and",64
NA,no place to go.,64
NA,The Leader of the Opposition in the last three,64
NA,minutes of his speech got on to capital gains,64
NA,"taxation, which was supposedly the point of the",64
NA,matter of public importance. I make the obvious,64
NA,point that a capital gains tax in this country is,64
NA,"long, long overdue. Every other comparable",64
NA,country has a capital gains tax. In a country,64
NA,"where capital is scarce, it has been an atrocity",64
NA,that we have seen the wasted allocation of scarce,64
NA,capital in non-productive areas of the economy,64
NA,with people chasing capital gains. The fact is,64
NA,that a capital gains tax assists the allocative,64
NA,efficiency of the economy. It does the right thing,64
NA,and puts the money in the right place-in the,64
NA,"most productive areas. It is very interesting, is it",64
NA,"not, to see the United States Government's tax",64
NA,reform proposals. The United States Congress is,64
NA,now seeking to increase the United States capital,64
NA,gains tax rate to the same level as that of the,64
NA,income tax. Why would that Government seek,64
NA,to increase the level of its capital gains tax rate,64
NA,to the same level as that of the income tax rate?,64
NA,It is because that Government knows that it is,64
NA,open to avoidance and that it distorts the level,64
NA,of allocative efficiency in the economy. That is,64
NA,why we have launched our policy.,64
NA,Instead of that fact penetrating the minds of,64
NA,"honourable members opposite, they are back to",64
NA,the quick rort and the quick quid-the consid-,64
NA,"eration that some of their mates might, if they",64
NA,chuck a couple of blocks of fiats up and pull a,64
NA,"capital gain out of that, have to pay tax, or that",64
NA,someone will drive a new car for private use,64
NA,and will not be able to write it off. It is all,64
NA,about letting their mob skate through without,64
NA,paying their fair share of tax. One would never,64
NA,believe that in this day and age a modern parlia-,64
NA,mentary party such as the Liberal Party of Aus-,64
NA,tralia or the National Party of Australia would,64
NA,proffer this sort of stuff as an issue in public,64
NA,policy. One would not believe that honourable,64
NA,"members opposite, after copping it in the neck",64
NA,"in 1983 and being thrown into opposition, would",64
NA,still return to this sort of sham argument about,64
NA,the tax system. The fact is that there are no,64
NA,"principles in their policy approach. Therefore,·",64
NA,there are no tax principles; there are no fiscal,64
NA,principles; there are no principles in social pol-,64
NA,icy; and there are no principles in economic,64
NA,policy-because it is catch as catch can. They,64
NA,are pushed and shov-d by all the pressure groups.,64
NA,They make policy on the run just as it suits,65
NA,them. That is precisely the problem. That is,65
NA,where they are.,65
NA,The fact is that the capital gains tax will be a,65
NA,great advance in tax policy in this country. It is,65
NA,totally prospective. Every property owned up to,65
NA,19 September 1985 will be exempt. All farms,65
NA,owned on 19 September 1985 will be exempt.,65
NA,All properties owned on 19 September 1985 will,65
NA,be exempt. The fact of the matter is that the,65
NA,roulette of section 25A of the Income Tax As-,65
NA,sessment Act which meant that one was never,65
NA,sure whether one would be capital gains taxed,65
NA,finally has been abandoned. We have thrown,65
NA,section 25A out. We now have a full capital,65
NA,gains tax where there is total certainty and no,65
NA,more roulette about whether one might be or,65
NA,might not be taxed at the full rate not on the,65
NA,"real gain, not on the inflation washed gain, but",65
NA,on the gain plus inflation-which was the con-,65
NA,sequence of tax under section 25A.,65
NA,After listening to the pathetic arguments of,65
NA,honourable members opposite on the range and,65
NA,ramifications of the Government's tax reform,65
NA,process over the last 18 months and seeing the,65
NA,"Bills finally presented, I say to the Parliament",65
NA,and to the public who are listening that all they,65
NA,should do is regard the Opposition as a party of,65
NA,"individuals with no corporate plan, no corporate",65
NA,"approach to tax, no corporate approach to eco-",65
NA,nomic policy and no corporate approach to so-,65
NA,"cial policy. If they want some fairness, decency",65
NA,"and equity in tax policy, in tax principles and in",65
NA,"economic and social policies, they will have to",65
NA,look to where they have always looked-the,65
NA,Australian Labor Party. They will get it from,65
NA,nowhere else. At least the Australian Labor Party,65
NA,has had the courage to get in there and clean,65
NA,"up the tax system, to clean the ramps and rorts",65
NA,out of it in an effort to make the tax system,65
NA,more decent and fairer for the honest taxpaying,65
NA,Australians who have been asked to carry the,65
NA,burden of public policy in this country for too,65
NA,long.,65
NA,"Therefore, we reject out of hand the dishonest",65
NA,proposition which is part and parcel of this,65
NA,matter of public importance today. We reject,65
NA,absolutely the view of the Opposition that there,65
NA,is indeed any validity in any of the charge pro-,65
NA,posed against the Government's tay. policy. We,65
NA,are prepared to let the public make a judgment,65
NA,at any time about where the decency and cor-,65
NA,rectness of public policy is in this country. I am,65
NA,confident that the judgment will always come,65
NA,down on the side of the Australian Labor Party-,65
NA,the great party of social change in this country;,65
NA,the great party which has given people a fair go,65
NA,and decent standard of living; the only party,65
NA,which will give Australians a fairer society.,65

NA,Second Reading,65
NA,Debate resumed.,65
Dr HARRY EDWARDS ,Berowra) (3.31)-,65
NA,I thought to address the House briefly on the,65
NA,"Dairy Produce Levy (No.1) Bill, the Dairy",65
NA,"Produce Levy (No.2) Bill, the Dairying Indus-",65
NA,try Research and Promotion Levy (Termination,65
NA,"of Levy) Bill, the Dairy Industry Stabilization",65
NA,Levy (Termination of Levy) Bill and the Dairy,65
NA,Legislation (Transitional Provisions and Conse-,65
NA,quential Amendments) Bill because this is an,65
NA,historic occasion of a sort. The scheme of ar-,65
NA,rangements for the industry proposed in the Bills,65
NA,replaces arrangements which have been in place,65
NA,in one form or another for over 50 years-since,65
NA,April 1934 to be precise. Arrangements that,65
NA,have persisted for that length of time must have,65
NA,something going for them. It needs to be recog-,65
NA,"nised that there has been a very significant,",65
NA,"indeed massive, rationalisation of the industry,",65
NA,"from 49,000 farms to 19,000 farms, over those",65
NA,years. Certainly it is an indictment of the Hawke,65
NA,Labor Government and indicative of its lack of,65
NA,genuine concern for the rural sector that last,65
NA,year it did its darndest to get through this Par-,65
NA,"liament the then Kerin plan, which represented",65
NA,a substantial cutback in support to producers in,65
NA,"this industry, which would have precipitated a",66
NA,wholesale crisis in the industry.,66
NA,"I intended to rehearse, by way of gaining some",66
NA,"perspective, a bit of history on this matter. I",66
NA,refreshed my memory for that purpose by con-,66
NA,"sulting the 1961 study, The Australian Dairy",66
NA,"Industry by Drane and Edwards, of which I was",66
NA,a co-author. I was going to look at the Paterson,66
NA,"plan which was implemented from 1926 to 1934,",66
NA,immediately preceding the arrangements which,66
NA,"we are putting to bed, so to speak, with this",66
NA,legislation. That was an interesting situation be-,66
NA,cause it was based on almost the same principle,66
NA,as the current proposed arrangements. There,66
NA,was to be a levy on all butter to pay a bounty,66
NA,"on exports, with the effect of raising the home",66
NA,price by the amount of the bounty. When that,66
NA,was introduced it led initially to an uplift of,66
NA,"some 18 per cent in the Australian price. Then,",66
NA,"in the Depression years, from 1930 to 1934, the",66
NA,uplift over the export return was 40 per cent. It,66
NA,shows how there could be variation in this ar-,66
NA,"rangement, though under the proposed arrange-",66
NA,ments in these Bills there is to be ultimately an,66
NA,"uplift of 30 per cent and that rate fixed,",66
NA,unchanging.,66
NA,Subsequently the equalisation arrangements as,66
NA,we have known them in recent years were im-,66
NA,"plemented. I note that 1959-60, predating the",66
NA,"European Economic Community, was another",66
NA,"period, like the Depression period, of bad export",66
NA,prices. Bad export prices have been characteris-,66
NA,tic of this industry. If at that time one included,66
NA,"the dairy industry subsidy, the uplift of the ef-",66
NA,fective Australian market price for butter was,66
NA,of the order of 100 per cent. It was in the light,66
NA,of that that the 1961 study concluded that some-,66
NA,thing drastic had to be done just as the Treas-,66
NA,"urer ( Mr Keating), now becoming aware of the",66
NA,yawning gap in the balance of payments and the,66
NA,"state of the Australian economy, realises that",66
NA,something drastic has to be done. He should,66
NA,have become aware of it a long while ago. That,66
NA,study then proposed a two-price scheme for but-,66
NA,ter and from that time the idea of a multiple,66
NA,price scheme has always had some currency in,66
NA,the industry. The proposal was that there be one,66
NA,"price, the high home market price, for a quota",66
NA,"of sales to the home market, and a different",66
NA,"price, the frequently much lower export price,",66
NA,for the balance of a farmer's production.,66
Mr CADMAN ,Does that work like multiple,66
NA,taxes?,66
Dr HARRY EDWARDS,"Well, it is rather",66
NA,akin to the arrangements which now prevail in,66
NA,"Western Australia, which has a three-tier ar-",66
NA,rangement as outlined by my colleague the hon-,66
NA,ourable member for Forrest ( Mr Drummond),66
NA,earlier today. It was recognised when it was,66
NA,proposed that that proposal was less than eco-,66
NA,nomically ideal. It was stated explicitly that it,66
NA,was proposed as a deliberate strong corrective to,66
NA,the then overexpansion of the industry.,66
NA,Mr Miles-Overproduction.,66
Dr HARRY EDWARDS,As I said; in this,66
NA,industry nothing much changes. More economi-,66
NA,cally ideal-to the extent that the export value,66
NA,is meaningful-was and is an arrangement to,66
NA,"have one price, reasonably lifted above a too",66
NA,low export price. There is a question mark about,66
NA,that-just as there was about the two-price,66
NA,"scheme, with its bureaucratic difficulties and so",66
NA,on. The question mark over the one-price scheme,66
NA,"is precisely over the meaningfulness, or lack of",66
NA,"it, of the export price in terms of the cost of",66
NA,"efficient production, which it rarely reflects, es-",66
NA,pecially with a fixed uplift factor for export,66
NA,"prices, proposed in this legislation to be 30 per",66
NA,"cent, in a context of low-we could call it cor-",66
NA,rupt-and fluctuating export returns. We can,66
NA,witness right now the impact that the EEC,66
NA,decision on sales of cheese to Japan will have,66
NA,on the export price of cheddar cheese.,66
Mr HODGMAN ,Is it the right measuring stick?,66
Dr HARRY EDWARDS,As to the long,66
NA,"term, that is very hard to say. The industry",66
NA,might get into considerable difficulties. There is,66
NA,no such thing as the perfect solution for an,66
NA,industry with such a long and troubled history,66
NA,as this one has. Owing largely to this Opposi-,66
NA,"tion's holding operation, which has given breath-",66
NA,ing space to the industry and has resulted in,66
NA,important transition concessions-we tried as best,66
NA,we could last year but we could not wring them,66
NA,out of the Government-we now have a meas-,66
NA,"ure before the House to which the industry,",66
NA,"albeit reluctantly, is prepared to give a go. How-",66
NA,"ever, no-one should underestimate the difficult",66
NA,times ahead for the industry in terms of further,66
NA,"rationalisation, at a potentially great cost in hu-",66
NA,"man terms, the very real equity problem for the",66
NA,small and disciplined Western Australian sec-,66
NA,"tor-which was referred to by my colleague, the",66
NA,"honourable member for Forrest-and even, in-",66
NA,"deed, the danger of breakouts from the",66
NA,arrangements.,66
NA,Mr Miles-Quite right.,66
Dr HARRY EDWARDS,As my colleague,66
NA,"says, that is most important. The danger of",66
NA,breakouts from the arrangements would bring,66
NA,into play the so-called 'comfort' or safety clause,66
NA,and result in a wholesale crisis in the industry.,67
NA,As the honourable member for Gwydir ( Mr,67
NA,"Hunt) said, the proposals promise some benefit",67
NA,and predictability to the industry and have built,67
NA,in some important new incentives. To that ex-,67
NA,tent the Opposition supports the Bills. But the,67
NA,industry and the Hawke Labor Government can,67
NA,rest assured that the Opposition will closely,67
NA,monitor the progress of these new arrangements.,67
Mr HAWKER ,Wannon) (3.40)-1 would,67
NA,like to endorse some of the words of my col-,67
NA,league the honourable member for Berowra (Dr,67
NA,"Harry Edwards). In beginning, I would like to",67
NA,just remind honourable members that today we,67
NA,are talking about some very important Bills,67
NA,"which, in fact, have taken years in gestation-",67
NA,"something like two years, which an elephant",67
NA,would know all about. Yet the Leader of the,67
NA,House ( Mr Young) has decided to guillotine this,67
NA,debate. I think it is outrageous and just unbelievister,67
NA,able that this Government can treat the dairy,67
NA,industry with such contempt.,67
NA,Mr Cadmao-There is not a single member,67
NA,of the Labor Party here.,67
Mr HAWKER,There is not one back,67
NA,bencher of the Australian Labor Party over there.,67
NA,"Worse still, the Minister for Primary Industry",67
NA,( Mr Kerin) has not been here for one second,67
NA,today of this debate. I think that is utterly,67
NA,"disgraceful. In fact, when we talk about the",67
NA,Minister for Primary Industry it is interesting to,67
NA,think that part of his portfolio covers bananas.,67
NA,I suppose he is the one who will give the Treas-,67
NA,urer ( Mr Keating) advice on how to run the,67
NA,banana republic.,67
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Leo Mc-,67
NA,Leay)- Order! The honourable member should,67
NA,make his comments relevant to the Bills.,67

NA,"Produce Bill 1986, the Dairy Produce Levy (No.",67
NA,"1) Bill 1986, the Dairy Produce Levy (No.2)",67

NA,the Dairy Industry Stabilisation Levy (Termina-,67
NA,tion of Levy) Bill 1986 and the Dairy Legislation,67
NA,(Transitional Provisions and Consequential,67
NA,"Amendments) Bill 1986 is one of bungling, as is",67
NA,the treatment of the dairying industry by the,67
NA,Minister.,67
NA,NA,67
Mr HAWKER,"It is a scandal, as my friend",67
NA,the honourable member for Barker has pointed,67
NA,out.,67
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,The honourable,67
NA,member for Barker should cease interjecting on,67
NA,his way through the chamber.,67
Mr HAWKER,If ever a Minister deserved a,67
NA,ride on the slow boat to China I suggest it is the,67
NA,present Minister for Primary Industry. He ac-,67
NA,tually announced back on 8 August 1984 that,67
NA,he would do something about the dairy industry.,67
NA,He demanded in a Press release that the industry,67
NA,respond within one month. What happened? We,67
NA,saw delay after delay. The Minister failed to,67
NA,consult properly with the industry. The Minister,67
NA,then blamed the industry. The Minister then,67
NA,"blamed the Agricultural Council, but the fact is",67
NA,that the Minister failed to explain and to con-,67
NA,vince people in the dairy industry of the merits,67
NA,of his original plan.,67
NA,"In short, the Minister failed to get support for",67
NA,what he was doing. Why did he fail? The Min-,67
NA,failed because he would not allow the in-,67
NA,dustry time to adjust. He wanted his new dairy,67
NA,plan and he wanted it right now. All that the,67
NA,industry and the Opposition kept saying to him,67
NA,was: 'Just give the dairy industry a bit of time,67
NA,"to adjust'. However, the Minister would not",67
NA,listen. All the industry and the Opposition was,67
NA,saying was: 'We want a bit of time to phase out,67
NA,the old arrangements'. One cannot say that is,67
NA,unreasonable when one considers that some of,67
NA,the old marketing arrangements have been in,67
NA,place for up to 50 years and when one also,67
NA,considers the time to restructure the Minister,67
NA,was proposing to give the industry.,67
NA,When one compares the time to restructure,67
NA,the Government has given the dairy industry,67
NA,"with the time it has given the steel industry,",67
NA,Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and the car,67
NA,industry one can see that it obviously was not,67
NA,an unreasonable request. But the Minister said:,67
NA,"'No, here is my marvellous plan and I want it",67
NA,in place without time for the industry to re-,67
NA,adjust'. Because of his obstinate behaviour and,67
NA,because he carried on like a spoilt child there,67
NA,was an uproar in the dairy industry. There were,67
NA,blockades. We then saw this Minister for Pri-,67
NA,mary Industry sink to the depths of political,67
NA,grime. When the Victorian election came up in,67
NA,March last year the Minister suddenly agreed to,67
NA,the Australian Dairy Industry Conference plan,67
NA,just two days before the Victoria election. The,67
NA,"Minister and the Premier of Victorian, Mr Cain,",67
NA,did the shabbiest political deal of the year. Both,67
NA,this Minister and the Victorian Premier should,67
NA,be utterly ashamed of what they did. The Mel-,67
NA,bourne Age put it very succinctly in an editorial,67
NA,on 29 March this year when it said:,67
NA,"The Federal Minister for Primary Industry, Mr",68
NA,was kind enough to let Mr Cain win his election before,68
NA,pulling the rug from under his feet.,68
NA,I think that spells out exactly the sort of tactics,68
NA,the Minister was prepared to stoop to. It con-,68
NA,firms that it was a very shabby deal. Following,68
NA,"this, the Minister then tried to ram his first",68
NA,attempt at the legislation through the House.,68
NA,Obviously he could get it through this place but,68
NA,"when he went to the Senate, the Senate told",68
NA,him what he had been told all along: 'Just give,68
NA,the industry a bit of time to adjust'. The Minis-,68
NA,ter was not happy with that. He was prepared,68
NA,to force this legislation on to the industry less,68
NA,than two months from the time it would come,68
NA,"into effect. Like a spoilt child, when the Senate",68
NA,"would not accept the Minister's legislation, he",68
NA,took his bat and his ball home and he withdrew,68
NA,"the legislation. So here we are again, a year later,",68
NA,with a similar Bill to put through the provisions,68
NA,the Minister wanted to introduce before. Ob-,68
NA,viously time has gone on. As preceding speakers,68
NA,"on this side of the chamber have pointed out,",68
NA,all the industry was asking from the Minister,68
NA,was a bit of time. This is the way the Minister,68
NA,has let it happen because he would not listen to,68
NA,the advice he was getting from the Opposition,68
NA,and from the industry.,68
NA,One thing that should be pointed out is that,68
NA,there is a myth that the Government has tried,68
NA,to peddle over the last few years that milk prices,68
NA,"are too high, especially fresh milk prices. When",68
NA,one looks at the figures presented by the hon-,68
NA,ourable member for Gwydir ( Mr Hunt) one sees,68
NA,that milk has not kept pace with the consumer,68
NA,"price index over the last 15 years. In fact, rela-",68
NA,"tively, it is much cheaper for consumers now",68
NA,than it was in 1970. It is interesting to look at,68
NA,the Press release put out by the Minister for,68
NA,Primary Industry on 22 March 1985 when he,68
NA,announced his first big attempt to bring in this,68
NA,new dairy legislation. At the bottom of page 2,68
NA,of the Press release there is an interesting little,68
NA,quotation.,68
Mr CADMAN ,"Hey, look at this!",68
Mr HAWKER,"Well, the Minister has ar-",68
NA,rived. I will read the quotation to him. He said:,68
NA,The consumer and the nation's economy will bene-,68
NA,fit--,68
Mr CADMAN ,The first time today.,68
Mr HAWKER,It is great to see him here.,68
NA,As the Minister said:,68
NA,The consumer and the nation's economy will benefit,68
NA,through lower prices.,68
NA,That really says what this Minister is trying to,68
NA,do with his dairy legislation and what is in the,68
NA,"Kerin, back of the mind of this Government. They are",68
NA,determined to get milk and milk product prices,68
NA,down. That is really what they are trying to do.,68
NA,"As I have said, we are on a tight schedule,",68
NA,but there are a couple of points I want to bring,68
NA,up with the Minister now that he has been so,68
NA,good as to come into this chamber for the de-,68
NA,bate. Clause 6 of the Dairy Produce Levy Bill,68
NA,(No.1) covers the situation where there is a,68
NA,dispute about interstate milk trade and it is,68
NA,decided to suspend the levy. I understand why,68
NA,"that clause is there, but I would like the Minister",68
NA,to tell us today what he will do should that,68
NA,clause ever be enacted. It is likely that there,68
NA,would be a complete collapse of the fresh milk,68
NA,marketing system. I wonder what the Minister,68
NA,would offer to the industry if that happened.,68
NA,Another point has been mentioned by preceding,68
NA,speakers but I will not go into it in detail. The,68
NA,Minister should be considering at some time in,68
NA,the future the question of the collection of the,68
NA,"levy on butterfat only. As has been pointed out,",68
NA,this could discriminate against producers with,68
NA,"certain types of cattle. There is a proposal that,",68
NA,if the dairy factories move towards a system of,68
NA,"payment on butterfat and protein, the Govern-",68
NA,ment should collect the levy in the same way.,68
NA,There is another point I want to raise with,68
NA,the Minister. He suggested that there is a need,68
NA,for ministerial approval in writing for virtually,68
NA,all operations of Asia Dairy Industries (Hong,68
NA,Kong) Ltd. Will the Minister explain either to-,68
NA,day or when he gets time-I know he is on a,68
NA,tight schedule-how he proposes to use this pro-,68
NA,vision in the legislation. As has already been,68
NA,"mentioned by preceding speakers in the House,",68
NA,there is quite a concern about the choice of a,68
NA,chairman of the Australian Dairy Corporation. I,68
NA,think the Minister should at least agree to con-,68
NA,sult the industry before he appoints a chairman.,68
NA,I think he should also give very serious thought,68
NA,to the request of the dairy industry that there,68
NA,be a producer chairman.,68
NA,"In conclusion, the way this legislation has fi-",68
NA,nally arrived is an example of bungling and,68
NA,"incompetence. We have seen delay after delay,",68
NA,"and at times, worst of all, downright deliberate",68
NA,deception by this Minister to try to help his,68
NA,colleague Mr Cain. The industry has been going,68
NA,through very difficult times over the last three,68
NA,years. Some of these difficulties have been exac-,68
NA,erbated by the actions and the inactions of the,68
NA,"Minister. Nonetheless, the legislation provides",68
NA,some opportunity for the industry to restructure.,68
NA,"However, as I pointed out, there are pitfalls that",68
NA,may arise in the future. The challenge will be,68
NA,whether the Minister will show his concern for,69
NA,"the future of dairy farmers, or, if the problem",69
NA,"arises, will be more interested in trying to exploit",69
NA,a potential breakdown of the marketing arrange-,69
NA,ment for the benefit of consumers.,69
Mr IAN ROBINSON ,Page) (3.50)-1 un-,69
NA,derstand that the time allotted for debate on the,69
NA,Dairy Produce Bill will expire in about 30 sec-,69
NA,onds. I will content myself with saying that I am,69
NA,delighted that the industry has been able to,69
NA,negotiate to the extent it has in terms of this,69
NA,very complex measure. Government speakers in,69
NA,this debate have suggested that the whole scheme,69
NA,is merely a carry-on of what had been proposed,69
NA,last year as the Kerin scheme. Nothing could be,69
NA,further from the truth. Fortunately there is to-,69
NA,day a degree of agreement between sections of,69
NA,the industry. In view of the long history of this,69
NA,"matter, it is to be hoped that this will be the",69
NA,starting point of a revised management of the,69
NA,industry.,69
NA,Many elements of the scheme concern the,69
NA,State governments and it is for those govern-,69
NA,ments and the dairy authorities within the re-,69
NA,spective States to give serious attention to such,69
NA,matters as payments being made on a basis which,69
NA,is satisfactory to all sections of the industry.,69
NA,Composite payments should take into account,69
NA,"quality. In that respect, I believe the levy ulti-",69
NA,mately must recognise the importance of that,69
NA,factor. Whilst the decision to base the levy on,69
NA,"butter-fat content has been justified, some very",69
NA,pertinent issues still remain for some producers.,69
NA,I give an example of what that means. A pro-,69
NA,"ducer with 3,500 litres of milk at 5.2 per cent",69
NA,butter-fat test will be charged the same as a,69
NA,"producer who has a yield of 5,000 litres of milk",69
NA,at a 3.6 per cent butter-fat content. A number,69
NA,"of problems will have to be resolved, and I hope",69
NA,that there will be co-operation between the re-,69
NA,spective sections of the industry to ensure that,69
NA,that is done.,69
NA,"Finally, it is unfortunate that more recognition",69
NA,was not given by the Government side of the,69
NA,House of the actions that have been taken by,69
NA,"the industry itself. I instance, for example, the",69
NA,last annual report of the Australian Dairy Re-,69
NA,"search Committee, which shows that for over a",69
NA,decade excellent work has been done to encour-,69
NA,age the development of new standards and new,69
NA,techniques. This is occurring to the advantage of,69
NA,"the industry. Therefore, it is wrong for the Gov-",69
NA,ernment to take credit for what in fact has been,69
NA,done by the industry itself. I hope that this,69
NA,measure will be a first step towards improving a,69
NA,most critical situation in one of the industries of,69
NA,this country which has been beleaguered for a,69
NA,very long time.,69
Mr KERIN ,Werriwa-Minister for Primary,69
NA,Industry) (3.53)-in reply-I thank the honour-,69
NA,able members who have made a contribution to,69
NA,this debate. It is a pity that many of them,69
NA,wasted some time by engaging in abuse. As we,69
NA,"all well know, this matter has been well dis-",69
NA,cussed in the Parliament. I will reply in detail,69
NA,"and at some length to the various points, alle-",69
NA,gations and abuse raised by honourable members,69
NA,opposite.,69
NA,The central theme of the reforms contained,69
NA,in the package is the reorientation of the indus-,69
NA,try to the requirements of the market rather,69
NA,than production. The Government and Parlia-,69
NA,ment are providing a revised framework to ena-,69
NA,ble the industry to improve its competitiveness,69
NA,in both the domestic and overseas markets. In,69
NA,addition to the range of measures contained in,69
NA,"the package, special funds are being made avail-",69
NA,able-$25m over five years for marketing inno-,69
NA,"vation of rural products, on which the dairy",69
NA,industry should be able to draw; up to $40m of,69
NA,"part B rural adjustment scheme borrowing, in",69
NA,"conjunction with the States, especially for the",69
NA,dairy industry. Moneys are being disbursed now,69
NA,and it is up to each State to choose the best,69
NA,form of assistance through part A or part B of,69
NA,the rural adjustment scheme.,69
NA,I would like to correct a misunderstanding,69
NA,that the honourable member for Gwydir ( Mr,69
NA,Hunt) has about the new underwriting arrange-,69
NA,ments. The old system involved underwriting 90,69
NA,per cent of three years' export returns. The new,69
NA,system will involve 85 per cent of a long term,69
NA,trend value based on eight years of export re-,69
NA,turns rather than 85 per cent of three years',69
NA,export returns. The new method is expected to,69
NA,benefit the industry in the current international,69
NA,situation.,69
NA,Everyone raised the question that the dairy,69
NA,"industry itself is running with. Of course, most",69
NA,farmers are paid on milk fat delivered. It is,69
NA,"desirable, therefore, to align collections of levies",69
NA,"to milk fat rather than whole milk. Also, expe-",69
NA,rience in Europe of levy based on milk suggests,69
NA,that problems could arise due to milk being,69
NA,dehydrated. In the future the industry may move,69
NA,to a compositional system of payments wherein,69
NA,farmers may be paid on milk fat and protein,69
NA,content or their milk solids non-fat product.,69
NA,When that occurs the Government will consider,69
NA,basing levies on a compositional basis. There is,69
NA,no objection to that.,69
NA,The reform of the Australian Dairy Corpora-,70
NA,tion follows the policy with respect to the re-,70
NA,form of all statutory marketing authorities; it,70
NA,provides for a corporate board chosen by an,70
NA,independent selection committee. The legislation,70
NA,provides for areas of expertise for board mem-,70
NA,bers and includes milk production. The Chair-,70
NA,man of the Corporation is selected and appointed,70
NA,by the Minister on essentially corporate leader-,70
NA,ship grounds. The best person for the job is,70
NA,appointed on merit rather than having a partic-,70
NA,ular background. It is true that I have not con-,70
NA,sulted the industry before contacting a person,70
NA,"who is eminently suitable, but I have privately",70
NA,conveyed that name to the honourable member,70
NA,for Gwydir. The Australian Dairy Industry,70
NA,"Council, the Australian Dairy Farmers Federa-",70
NA,tion and the United Dairyfarmers of Victoria all,70
NA,understand why I acted as quickly as I did: It is,70
NA,due to the eminence of the person. Of course,70
NA,there will be consultations in the future.,70
NA,It is absolute nonsense to say that there has,70
NA,been no consultation. I have just taken out some,70
NA,figures. The major industry meetings that I have,70
NA,had on this whole issue are as follows: I had 20,70
NA,"meetings with the industry's leadership, five",70
NA,meetings with industry groups at a State level,70
NA,"and six meetings with State Ministers, there were",70
NA,six meetings of the Australian Agricultural,70
NA,"Council, the matter was considered in Cabinet",70
NA,"on 17 occasions, I have met with the industry",70
NA,"55 times since I January 1985, the matter has",70
NA,been before the primary industry sub-committee,70
NA,13 times. Anyone who says that there has been,70
NA,no consultation on this issue or that I have,70
NA,treated the industry with contempt is really hav-,70
NA,ing himself on.,70
NA,The final point I would like to make is that,70
NA,"this legislation is, by and large, the same as the",70
NA,"package of legislation I put up about a year ago,",70
NA,when the industry chose not to understand it. I,70
NA,was certainly prepared to allow the ADIC to,70
NA,"again try to get a rolling entitlement scheme up,",70
NA,but it ran into the same snag that I ran into;,70
NA,"that is, that it is very difficult to",70
NA,governments to agree on this industry. I accept,70
NA,what the honourable member for Brand (Ms,70
NA,Fatin) and the honourable member for Forrest,70
NA,( Mr Drummond) have said about the situation,70
NA,in Western Australia. I praise the honourable,70
NA,member for Brand for the assiduous way she has,70
NA,pursued the interests of the Western Australian,70

Mr HAWKER ,Wannon) (3.59)-1 wish to,70
NA,take up a point with the Minister for Primary,70
NA,Industry ( Mr Kerin). I think what the Minister,70
NA,said a minute ago was quite offensive. He praised,70
NA,the honourable member for Brand (Ms Fatin),70
NA,yet he ignored the honourable member for For-,70
NA,rest ( Mr Drummond). The honourable member,70
NA,for Forrest has worked very hard for his dairy,70
NA,farmers. He has brought up the concern of dairy,70
NA,farmers in Western Australia with the Opposi-,70
NA,tion rural committee and in the Opposition party,70
NA,room. He has spoken to all members who have,70
NA,any interest whatsoever in the dairy industry,70
NA,about the concern of the dairy farmers in West-,70
NA,ern Australia and has done so in a very eloquent,70
NA,and persuasive manner. I think that the Minister,70
NA,was quite uncharitable in his comments when he,70
NA,ignored the efforts of the honourable member,70
NA,for Forrest.,70
Mr KERIN ,Werriwa-Minister for Primary,70
NA,Industry) (3.59)-in reply-All I can say is that,70
NA,I acknowledge the efforts of the honourable,70
NA,member for Forrest ( Mr Drummond). I linked,70
NA,the two members together. Of course as a mem-,70
NA,ber of the Australian Labor Party I am far more,70
NA,aware of the efforts of the honourable member,70
NA,for Brand (Ms Fatin) because she has been in,70
NA,"the primary industry sub-committee which, as I",70
NA,"said, discussed this matter 13 times. Of course I",70

NA,"remind the people who are listening, both in this",71
NA,"chamber and on the airwaves, to this debate on",71
NA,"the Dairy Produce Bill 1986, the Dairy Produce",71

NA,Dairy Legislation (Transitional Provisions and,71

NA,problem currently facing Australia with these,71
NA,Bills is that they are being guillotined through,71
NA,"the House, so preventing a number of honoura-",71
NA,ble members from participating in the debate.,71
NA,The Leader of the House ( Mr Young) moved,71
NA,"the guillotine in the House this morning, indicat-",71
NA,ing to the House that the guillotine was neces-,71
NA,"sary because, he alleged, the Senate had put a",71
NA,particular restraint on the time it would make,71
NA,available to consider the Bills it received from,71
NA,the House of Representatives.,71
Mr HOLDING ,That is true; you know this.,71
Mr ANDREW ,"One moment, if the Minister",71
NA,"would not mind. For this reason, the Leader of",71
NA,"the House said, it was necessary to guillotine",71
NA,"these Bills, and Bills to be dealt with next week,",71
NA,"through the House. He not only alleged, but",71
NA,"stated, that the guillotine was solely the result",71
NA,"of actions by the Australian Democrats and, he",71
NA,"implied, by the National Party of Australia and",71
NA,the Liberal Party of Australia. Those who were,71
NA,listening to the moving of the guillotine would,71
NA,"have presumed, therefore, that members of the",71
NA,Australian Labor Party had been offended by,71
NA,this course of action.,71
Mr HOLDING ,We are.,71
Mr ANDREW,I am delighted that the Min-,71
NA,"ister is interjecting, because the Leader of the",71
NA,House went on to imply that there were shades,71
NA,of 1975 and something unconstitutional in the,71
NA,action of the Senate. I will have the Minister,71
NA,Aboriginal Affairs ( Mr Holding) know that there,71
NA,may well be honourable members on this side of,71
NA,the House who agree that this is a most unusual,71
NA,"course of action. I was surprised and, I must",71
NA,"confess, rather delighted to pick up the .Senate",71
NA,Hansard record of those events and discover,71
NA,that there was no division. Not one ALP senator,71
NA,voted against the position in which the House,71
NA,currently finds itself.,71
NA,Mr Hawker-Are you sure?,71
Mr ANDREW,Allow me to quote what was,71
NA,"said by Senator Grimes, the Manager of Govern-",71
NA,ment Business in the Senate.,71
NA,Madam SPEAKER-Order! I point out to the,71
NA,honourable member that we are on the third,71
NA,reading of the Dairy Produce Lev- (No. -) Bill.,71
NA,I ask him to be relevant to the Bill that IS now,71
NA,before the House.,71
Mr ANDREW,"I respect your point, Madam",71
NA,Speaker. I merely reiterate that we are being,71
NA,"forced, because of the action that has been taken,",71
NA,to deal with this legislation in less time than we,71
NA,would choose. The action was more bipartisan,71
NA,than the Leader of the House would have us,71
NA,believe.,71
NA,Madam SPEAKER-The honourable mem-,71
NA,ber has made his point.,71
Mr ANDREW,I pick up the point made by,71
NA,the honourable member for Wan non ( Mr,71
NA,Hawker) and the honourable member for For-,71
NA,rest ( Mr Drummond). The dairy indu.stry d?es,71
NA,not deceive itself into supposing that thiS hurned,71
NA,legislation will meet all of its needs. I represent,71
NA,dairy farmers who are disadvantaged by the ac-,71
NA,tion being taken in the House today-disadvan-,71
NA,taged because they themselves have controlled,71
NA,their market and made it their business to pro-,71
NA,vide incentives to encourage dairy farmers to,71
NA,produce during the off season to the point at,71
NA,which the northern milk suppliers in South Aus-,71
NA,tralia whom I represent have farmers whose,71
NA,spring:autumn production ratio is 1.15:1 com-,71
NA,pared with the Adelaide suppliers' ratio .of 2.5:1.,71
NA,They have exercised the sort of responsible con-,71
NA,trol and reward for being prudent that would,71
NA,make this legislation unnecessary across Aus-,71
NA,tralia. They are being penalised for having taken,71
NA,that action. I regret that I have to hurry to say,71
NA,"those words. I regret, too, that this legislation",71
NA,"has been guillotined through the House, when",71
NA,Senator Grimes was prepared to say that the,71
NA,Government would not oppose and certainly,71
NA,would not divide on the amendment that Sena-,71
NA,"tor Chaney was proposing, forcing the Senate to",71

Mr DRUMMOND ,Forrest) (4.05)-1 wish,72
NA,to make one point regarding the Dairy Produce,72
NA,Levy (No.2) Bill which I did not have time,72
NA,earlier in the day to make. Other governments,72
NA,have legislation to protect their farmers from,72
NA,corrupt world prices. I tried to illustrate that,72
NA,"this Bill is about world traded prices, but",72
NA,they are corrupt prices. It is not a genuine ex-,72
NA,port commodity measure such as every nation,72
NA,"has. I refer, for example, to the United States",72
NA,and its farm Bill. This legislation will expose,72
NA,Australian farmers to those corrupt prices. I,72
NA,suggest that the Government is swimming against,72
NA,the tide by proceeding in this way. The prices,72
NA,"that come back, because there is no umbrella of",72
NA,"any description underneath this export price,",72
NA,will not really signal to the farmers what that,72
NA,last litre of milk is worth.,72
NA,Dr Harry Edwards-What is it worth?,72
Mr DRUMMOND,The last litre of milk is,72
NA,worth between 5c and lOco We must remember,72
NA,that the end of our export market tends towards,72
NA,stock feeds. It is a very low value commodity.,72
NA,"So, as I say, every country has some sort of net",72
NA,under individual companies that find it difficult,72
NA,to find a market. The New Zealand Dairy Board,72
NA,purchases and acts as sole seller. The European,72
NA,Economic Community provides restitution sub-,72
NA,sidies. They were well described by the honour-,72
NA,able member for Gwydir ( Mr Hunt) earlier today,72
NA,in regard to the effect it is having on the cheese,72
NA,market into Japan. Those restitution subsidies,72
NA,are now flexible and secret. The United States,72
NA,Government has export enhancement programs.,72
NA,This is what Australian producers will be up,72
NA,against as time goes by. So if our individual,72
NA,companies do not have operating in the inter-,72
NA,national market a real umbrella of any descrip-,72
NA,"tion-such as pooling, which exists under the",72
NA,present system-they will find it difficult to,72
NA,ticipate under the closer economic relations ar-,72
NA,"rangement with New Zealand in third markets,",72
NA,as CER directs; and they will find it increasingly,72
NA,difficult to meet the General Agreement on Tar-,72
NA,"iffs and Trade requirements. As I say, my fear",72
NA,is that they will turn more and more back to,72
NA,the domestic market and will undercut the do-,72
NA,mestic price through supermarket chains. I do,72
NA,not quite see how the system will not fall into,72
NA,disrepute.,72
Mr KERIN ,Werriwa-Minister for Primary,72
NA,Industry) (4.08)-in reply-Obviously the hon-,72
NA,ourable member for Forrest ( Mr Drummond),72
NA,does not understand what is being done or the,72
NA,present situation in the dairy industry. Austra-,72
NA,lian farmers are already exposed to the corrupt,72
NA,price on the international market. If the honour-,72
NA,able member is suggesting that we get into the,72
NA,"business of competitive subsidisation, I am",72
NA,amazed that his Party's policy document did not,72
NA,say that this week. If we wanted to get into,72
NA,competitive subsidies against the European Eco-,72
NA,"in fact nomic Community and the United States, we",72
NA,"would be looking at, for all commodities, at least",72
NA,$5 billion or $6 billion worth of subsidies in this,72
NA,country. We really cannot afford that. The ex-,72
NA,isting system does not pass any market signal,72
NA,"back to an individual producer, nor does it re-",72
NA,ward a manufacturer for any particular sales,72
NA,choice he takes.,72
NA,It is nonsense to say that the industry has no,72
NA,umbrella because the underwriting will trigger if,72
NA,there is a dramatic price collapse. The system of,72
NA,underwriting will be a far better mechanism,72
NA,because under the present system we could have,72
NA,a pay-out in a year that is good and no pay-out,72
NA,in a year that is bad. That is a technical defi-,72
NA,"ciency, and that is why we have moved to an 8-",72
NA,year average.,72
NA,It is nonsense to say there is no underpinning,72
NA,of the industry. Quite apart from the money we,72
NA,are putting in with respect to restructuring the,72
NA,industry we are starting off with a level of price,72
NA,support by domestic consumers and by product,72
NA,levies that amounts to 46 per cent above the,72
NA,export price at this time. We are letting that,72
NA,down gradually over six or seven years in an,72
NA,effort to get more efficiency. If we can get effi-,72
NA,ciency in the industry we will get greater returns,72
NA,"for all people, and they will be more equitable",72
NA,returns.,72
NA,The big problem for the industry really centres,72
NA,around Victoria because of the farm cash oper-,72
NA,"ating surpluses at present of about $41,000 in",72
NA,"par- Western Australia, going down to about $13,000",72
NA,in Victoria. That is because Victoria carries vir-,72
NA,tually all the load of exports. If the industry,72
NA,wants to go back to operating within its own,72
NA,"little States, we will have a collapse of the whole",72
NA,industry once an interstate breakout occurs. This,72
NA,legislation is really the industry's last chance to,72
NA,try to head down the path of having a national,72
NA,dairy industry.,72

NA,NA,73
NA,presented a submission to the Minister for Pri-,73
NA,mary Industry ( Mr Kerin) outlining the eco-,73
NA,nomic and social tragedy taking place in the,73
NA,central MaIlee area of my electorate. In that,73
NA,submission I largely concentrated on the extreme,73
NA,financial difficulties being faced by primary pro-,73
NA,ducers and the stresses being faced by the com-,73
NA,munities concerned. As a result of those,73
NA,representations certain actions in the financial,73
NA,and social area took place that have been of,73
NA,significant help.,73
NA,"However, I now wish to bring before this",73
NA,1986 Parliament the need for a similar type of assist-,73
NA,ance to be provided to smaIl business operators,73
NA,in the same region. It is now becoming apparent,73
NA,that many smaIl businesses are finding it difficult,73
NA,"to survive, as a direct consequence of the down-",73
NA,"turn in primary industry. Of course, many of",73
NA,these businesses have suffered setbacks because,73
NA,of a sudden faIl in farm spending and the inabil-,73
NA,ity of many smaIl business operators to recover,73
NA,outstanding debts incurred by farmers. Their,73
NA,problem has been further exacerbated by the,73
NA,drift in population away from smaIl towns due,73
NA,"to government services being withdrawn, young",73
NA,people seeking employment in provincial and,73
NA,"capital cities, and second and third generation",73
NA,farming families leaving the district to seek em-,73
NA,ployment elsewhere simply because farm in-,73
NA,comes cannot support them.,73
NA,A recent survey carried out by Bruce Mc-,73
NA,"Kenzie, associate head of the social science fac-",73
NA,ulty at the Warrnambool Institute of Advanced,73
NA,"Education, has shown that one in four families",73
NA,in the MaIlee and Sunraysia districts now live,73
NA,"below the poverty line, which paints a very grim",73
NA,picture for operators of smaIl business hoping,73
NA,for an immediate improvement in trade. It is felt,73
NA,that even with the prospect of good harvests by,73
NA,"farmers this season, that will only marginaIly",73
NA,assist smaIl business. It is estimated that at least,73
NA,95 per cent of farms in the area now have debts,73
NA,to such a level that it will take a series of good,74
NA,seasons to restore them to a viable situation.,74
NA,The very close contact I have had with small,74
NA,business operators in my electorate leads me to,74
NA,believe that urgent assistance must become avail-,74
NA,able to them almost immediately or they will be,74
NA,forced to close or go into bankruptcy. As an,74
NA,indication of the types of debts owned by pri-,74
NA,mary producers to small businesses the following,74
NA,information should be known to the House. For,74
NA,"example, an agricultural service business",74
NA,"ently owed some $8,500 for chemicals supplied",74
NA,to a farmer for the 1985 crop; another farmer,74
NA,"owes approximately $48,000 for fertiliser; an-",74
NA,other small business operator is owed some,74
NA,"$12,500 for superphosphate. Of course, these",74
NA,instances could be repeated over and over again,74
NA,"and, in almost every community, with amounts",74
NA,owed varying from what some may consider to,74
NA,be small to those larger than those I have cited,74
NA,here.,74
NA,"Of course, small business operators find that",74
NA,in the present depressed economic climate it is,74
NA,simply not possible to recover these debts be-,74
NA,cause the equity many farmers hold in their land,74
NA,is low and their assets are unsaleable. One busi-,74
NA,ness operator has advised me that if he is forced,74
NA,"to carry the debts of farmers for, say, the next",74
NA,"12 months, he may well be out of business as",74
NA,the interest he is paying on his money is more,74
NA,than he can earn in the foreseeable future. It,74
NA,"has been suggested by a financial institution, of",74
NA,"course, that suppliers to small business may see",74
NA,"their way clear to, in some way, acknowledge",74
NA,their special situation as many such suppliers are,74
NA,diverse and financially strong.,74
NA,to suggest that one arm of business should act,74
NA,as a banker for another? I believe not.,74
NA,In the submission that I am to put before the,74
NA,"Minister for Primary Industry, the Minister for",74
NA,"Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator",74
NA,"Button), the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) and the",74
NA,"Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) next week,",74
NA,I have suggested three possible sources of finan-,74
NA,"cial support that could be provided. Firstly, I",74
NA,believe that funding will be necessary to allow,74
NA,operators of small business to meet a short-fall,74
NA,"in their basic living requirements. Secondly,",74
NA,obvious that funds are required for carry-on,74
NA,"finance. Thirdly, it is obvious that loan restruc-",74
NA,turing must take place and that interest rate,74
NA,subsidies also must become available to the small,74
NA,"business sector, as they have been made avail-",74
NA,able to the farming sector.,74
NA,It is recognised that the administration of,74
NA,"funds is a State responsibility. However, I re-",74
NA,quest the relevant Commonwealth Ministers to,74
NA,consult their Victorian State Government col-,74
NA,leagues to develop appropriate programs and to,74
NA,meet any request for funds which may be made,74
NA,by the Victorian Government. It could be said,74
NA,that increased spending by farming families would,74
NA,also assist the viability of small businesses. How-,74
NA,"ever, there is little hope in the next two or three",74
NA,years and it will be virtually impossible if gov-,74
NA,ernment assistance is not available to reduce,74
NA,is pres- overhead expenses any further.,74
Mr HOLLIS ,Throsby) (4.l8)-1t seems that,74
NA,this is the week for leaks! Today I received into,74
NA,my hand a letter sent from the office of the High,74
NA,Commissioner for Sri Lanka to Sinhalese in Aus-,74
NA,"tralia. That letter, on headed paper and signed",74
NA,"by the Commissioner, gives Sinhalese in Aus-",74
NA,tralia the correct line to follow in response to,74
NA,"recent events in Sri Lanka. However, the letter",74
NA,ends up by saying that the matters are best left,74
NA,to the judgment of the recipients of the letter,74
NA,and to the resources that they can harness. Let,74
NA,us look at the suggestions made by this diplomat,74
NA,accredited to Australia. He suggests writing let-,74
NA,"ters giving facts of incidents, together with paper",74
NA,"cuttings to members of parliament, especially to",74
NA,members who have been anti-Sri Lanka on this,74
NA,"issue-for example, the honourable member for",74
NA,"Hotham ( Mr Kent), Senator Chipp, myself and",74
NA,"others. As a member of parliament, I do not",74
NA,object to this. We get many such letters. I make,74
NA,the point that I am not anti-Sri Lanka. What I,74
NA,am anti are the genocidal policies culminating in,74
NA,the military action now taking place by the,74
NA,current layawardene Government. The letter,74
NA,"However, is it fair goes on to say:",74
NA,Give facts about the battle being waged between the,74
NA,rival terrorist groups.,74
NA,A lot of corroborative propaganda was enclosed,74
NA,for this purpose. He goes on to say:,74
NA,Write letters and send material to church organisa-,74
NA,"tions-Unirng Church, human rights and Amnesty In-",74
NA,"ternational bodies in Australia, who have been one-sided",74
NA,on this issue.,74
NA,"What he does not say, of course, is that these",74
NA,people have not swallowed the lies put out by,74
NA,it is the Sri Lankan High Commissioner in Canberra.,74
NA,He says:,74
NA,Write letters and send material to editors of major,74
NA,"newspapers and radio and TV stations and also, if",74
NA,"possible, give interviews which they can carry.",74
NA,The one I really find unacceptable is the follow-,74
NA,"ing, which I quote in full because it is very",74
NA,such important. The letter from the High Commis-,74
NA,sioner for Sri Lanka said:,74
NA,Arrange for demonstrations if possible in front of,75
NA,Indian trade/consular offices and in front of Indian,75
NA,Airlines/ Air India offices with appropriate placards and,75
NA,slogans.,75
NA,I find it totally unacceptable that a diplomat in,75
NA,this country should use or abuse his position to,75
NA,incite Australian citizens-many of the Sinhalese,75
NA,in this country are naturalised Australian citi-,75
NA,zens-to get involved in activities against a,75
NA,"friendly nation, that is, India, in an attempt to",75
NA,"disrupt the activities of its official organisations,",75
NA,thus causing unwarranted problems in the rela-,75
NA,tionship between Australia and India and caus-,75
NA,ing unnecessary embarrassment to Australia.,75
NA,The current High Commissioner for Sri Lanka,75
NA,"has recently taken up his post, but one should",75
NA,"bear in mind that this gentleman, prior to his",75
NA,"appointment, was Secretary of the ministry es-",75
NA,tablished to produce and propagate incorrect,75
NA,information and blatant lies to achieve the goals,75
NA,"of the Sri Lankan Government; that is, wiping",75
NA,out the entire Tamil community in Sri Lanka.,75
NA,"Perhaps it is time, at the commencement of his",75
NA,"tour of duty, that the High Commissioner be",75
NA,reminded of the behaviour expected of a diplo-,75
NA,mat in this country and that it is totally unac-,75
NA,ceptable that people should be encouraged to,75
NA,disrupt the legitimate activities of a third friendly,75
NA,nation.,75
NA,Madam SPEAKER-I remind the honourable,75
NA,"member of standing order 74, which states:",75
NA,"No Member may use the name of Her Majesty, her",75
NA,"representative in the Commonwealth, or her represent-",75
NA,"ative in a State, disrespectfully in debate, nor for the",75
NA,purpose of influencing the House in its deliberations.,75
NA,Sri Lanka is a country with which Australia has,75
NA,friendly relations. I draw that to the honourable,75
NA,member's attention for future reference.,75
Mrs KELLY ,Canberra) (4.23)-Last night,75
NA,in the adjournment debate I was interrupted,75
NA,when I was discussing the proposal by the United,75
NA,Nations Children's Fund to immunise the world's,75
NA,children by 1990. I was talking of the value of,75
NA,that campaign and indicating my hope that Aus-,75
NA,tralia could contribute to that in some way and,75
NA,also link our Government's campaign for a mea-,75
NA,"sle-free Bicentennial, because it is important that",75
NA,we give recognition to the fact that vaccine,75
NA,preventable diseases kill a total of over three,75
NA,"million children a year in the developing world,",75
NA,with a similar number crippled and handi-,75
NA,capped. Last night I gave a breakdown of the,75
NA,deaths of young children caused by not having,75
NA,"appropriate vaccines; for example, 58 per cent,",75
NA,"or over two million, of these deaths are caused",75
NA,"by measles alone, over 800,000 deaths are caused",75
NA,"by tetanus and a further 606,000 deaths are",75
NA,caused by whooping cough. Obviously action has,75
NA,to be taken to assist many of the countries in,75
NA,the developing world to move towards this,75
NA,UNICEF goal.,75
NA,The Secretary-General of the United Nations,75
NA,has taken the unprecedented step of writing to,75
NA,the Presidents or Prime Ministers of all 159,75
NA,"member states, drawing to their attention this",75
NA,potential and asking for their personal support,75
NA,for the goal of immunising all of the world's,75
NA,children by 1990. The Prime Minister ( Mr,75
NA,Hawke) has reacted very favourably to the re-,75
NA,quest of the Secretary-General of the United,75
NA,Nations and has passed the letter on to the,75
NA,Minister for Health (Dr Blewett) and the Min-,75
NA,ister for Foreign Affairs ( Mr Hayden). I hope,75
NA,that our Government will co-operate in this,75
NA,campaign.,75
NA,The cost of protection against six vaccine pre-,75
NA,"ventable diseases is approximately $5 per child,",75
NA,which does not seem very much to save the lives,75
NA,of children. This estimate covers everything in-,75
NA,"cluding the cost of vaccines, needles, syringes",75
NA,"and cottons as well as the cost of equipment,",75
NA,"staff salaries, training, transport and petrol. The",75
NA,cost of immunising all children and saving more,75
NA,than three million children from dying in this,75
NA,"way is approximately $500m a year, slightly less",75
NA,than the cost of three advanced fighter planes. I,75
NA,support the campaign and hope that the Gov-,75
NA,ernment and all the members of this Parliament,75
NA,will also give their support in whatever way,75
NA,possible to this very worthwhile aim.,75
Mr CADMAN ,Mitchell) (4.26)-1 would like,75
NA,to make a few remarks about the fringe benefits,75
NA,tax. I do not think the full ramifications of it,75
NA,have broken through to members of the com-,75
NA,munity. Only now are they beginning to under-,75
NA,stand what it is about. The remarks of the,75
NA,Treasurer ( Mr Keating) in the urgency debate,75
NA,today really demonstrated his isolation from,75
NA,reality. It is fine for him to have big waterside,75
NA,"residences, cars and antiques, but his lifestyle is",75
NA,quite different from that of a farm worker on,75
NA,whom a fringe benefits tax will now be imposed,75
NA,"when he goes out into the paddock, cuts some",75
NA,firewood and brings it home to use in the fuel,75
NA,stove or the open fire. It is quite different for,75
NA,"the Treasurer to grow his own vegetables, as",75
NA,"most farm workers do, and bring them home.",75
NA,He and his wife grow them after working hours.,75
NA,They take advantage of where they live to pro-,75
NA,vide a benefit for themselves and their families.,75
NA,This process can be extended to the way this,76
NA,Government will apply the fringe benefits tax to,76
NA,other things. Dedicated volunteers and workers,76
NA,work for minimal funds for voluntary organisa-,76
NA,tions. They have written to me and to the Gov-,76
NA,ernment. The Government seems to think that,76
NA,"the St Vincent de Paul Society, the Sydney City",76
NA,Mission and other charitable organisations are,76
NA,somehow tax dodgers. Those are the words that,76
NA,the Treasurer consistently used. He calls them,76
NA,rip-off merchants and rorters. That is why we,76
NA,are to have a fringe benefits tax-to stop the,76
NA,rorters and the people in the rip-off system. I,76
NA,not regard those charitable and hospitable organ-,76
NA,isations as rip-off merchants. I regard them as,76
NA,some of the better parts of our society. There is,76
NA,a double whammy in store for those groups,76
NA,because if someone should bequeath property to,76
NA,"those organisations, capital gains tax will have",76
NA,to be paid by the estate of the person making,76
NA,the donation.,76
Mr HOLDING ,That is right.,76
Mr CADMAN,The Minister for Aboriginal,76
NA,Affairs confirms it. Those who undertake all the,76
NA,voluntary and good things in our society-where,76
NA,people help each other and show their commit-,76
NA,ment to and belief in an organisation that is,76
NA,doing good work-will be penalised. What will,76
NA,happen if someone should leave a property to,76
NA,an organisation of the type that I have men-,76
NA,"tioned and no money is left in the estate, if it",76
NA,comprises only property? Who will pay? The,76
NA,organisation that is the beneficiary will be,76
NA,charged. Either somebody has to pay the capital,76
NA,gains tax or the estate will go into debt. Do we,76
NA,"have to get into the pockets of the children, the",76
NA,"beneficiaries of the estate, and say: 'Mortgage",76
NA,your house to pay the capital gains tax'? The,76
NA,Minister shakes his head. I guarantee that he,76
NA,"does not know, and that Cabinet has not even",76
NA,"considered this, because the Treasurer is so iso-",76
NA,lated and remote from the realities of Australia.,76
NA,I turn to another stupidity in the fringe bene-,76
NA,fits tax. If a person has a motor car which is,76
NA,used for work and has accessories on that motor,76
NA,"car, those accessories by definition must be work-",76
NA,related accessories or they will be valued as part,76
NA,of the value of the car. How crazy can that be?,76
NA,Is a two-way radio an accessory for work? I,76
NA,"guess that it is, so it will not be valued with the",76
NA,car. What about a cassette player? It would,76
NA,probably not be included unless one happened,76
NA,do to work in radio when a special case would have,76
NA,to be presented as to why a cassette player in,76
NA,the car should not be counted for the fringe,76
NA,benefits tax. A car phone is something that might,76
NA,have to be considered. What about special lights,76
NA,"for country drivers or travelling salesmen, or",76
NA,"special mirrors on work vehicles, needed for",76
NA,safety purposes? Those opposite should see how,76
NA,stupid and crazy this is.,76
Mr HOLDING ,You're stupid.,76
Mr CADMAN,I am not. The Minister should,76
NA,read the book. It is in the book. He has not read,76
NA,the tombstone of this Government. He has not,76
NA,read the book that has gone out to small busi-,76
NA,nesses. The matter of work-related accessories is,76
NA,"spelt out chapter and verse. The example given,",76
NA,"as a matter of fact, is a two-way radio. The",76
NA,Minister has not even read it. The Minister is,76
NA,remote but his responsibility is not the Treasur-,76
NA,er's. The Treasurer should know these things. In,76
NA,"fact, he does not. He regards charitable and",76
NA,"hospitable organisations as rip-off merchants, and",76
NA,he regards farm workers as people who also need,76
NA,to be punished by a fringe benefits tax. He is,76
NA,remote and isolated. He lives in his big mansion,76
NA,by Sydney Harbour.,76
Mr SPEAKER,"Order! It being 4.30 p.m., the",76
NA,"House stands adjourned until Monday, 26 May",76
NA,"1986, at 2 p.m.",76
NA,House adjourned at 4.30 p.m.,76
NA,The following answers to questions were circulated:,77
NA,Attorney-General's Department: Payments to,77
NA,NA,77
NA,(Question No. 2047),77
NA,"Mr Blunt asked the Attorney-General, upon",77
NA,"notice, on 9 October 1985:",77
NA,NA,77
NA,"Adams and Mr Rod Cameron, their companies, or prin-",77
NA,"cipals of their companies, for services rendered to the",77
NA,Minister's Department or authorities under the Minis-,77

NA,(2) What amounts have been paid to each of these,77
NA,"people or companies for (a) travel allowance, (b) air",77
NA,"fares, (c) accommodation costs, (d) hire car expenses",77
NA,and (e) any other expenses incurred.,77
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,The answer to the hon-,77
NA,ourable member's question is as follows:,77
NA,I have been informed by the Human Rights Commis-,77
NA,sion that the advertising agency Monahan Dayman Ad-,77
NA,ams was selected to conduct the information and pUblicity,77
NA,program associated with the proclamation of the Sex,77
NA,NA,77
NA,that agency.,77
NA,"No money, travel allowance, air fares, accommoda-",77
NA,"tion costs, hire car expenses or any other expenses was",77
NA,paid to Mr Adams personally.,77
NA,"The Commission paid the advertising agency $175,123.",77
NA,"Of this $123,688 was disbursed to cover items such as",77
NA,"printing, display and direct mail costs as well as distripractice",77
NA,"bution and marketing costs. The remaining $51,435 was",77
NA,"retained by the agency to cover the creative work,",77
NA,consultation and production costs. The amounts speci-,77
NA,fied in the second part of the question were part of the,77
NA,expenses incurred by the agency and are included in the,77
NA,"$51,435 mentioned earlier.",77
NA,"No payments have been made to Mr Cameron, nor,",77
NA,"as far as the Commission is aware, to any company with",77
NA,which Mr Cameron is associated.,77
NA,Taxation: Evasion and Avoidance,77
NA,(Question No. 2217),77
NA,"Mr Jacobi asked the Attorney-General, upon",77
NA,"notice, on 16 October 1985:",77
NA,"(I) Will he take steps, including consultations with",77
NA,"the States, to restructure the provisions of the Bank-",77
NA,ruptcy Act and its administration to close off existing,77
NA,loop-holes that are being exploited by individuals to,77
NA,evade or avoid payment of their liabilities to creditors,77
NA,and their obligations in regard to commercial morality.,77
NA,(2) Will he take steps to arrange for,77
NA,of the Companies Code and its administration by the,77
NA,various States to close off existing loop-holes that are,77
NA,being exploited by companies and their directors to,77
NA,avoid the payment of liabilities and their obligations to,77
NA,the commercial public in general.,77
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,The answer to the hon-,77
NA,ourable member's question is as follows:,77
NA,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,77
NA,(I) On 20 November 1983 my predecessor as,77
NA,"Attorney-General, Senator Gareth Evans, Q.C., re-",77
NA,quested the Australian Law Reform Commission to,77
NA,undertake a major review of the law and practice of,77
NA,"insolvency, both personal and corporate. Mr R. W.",77
NA,Harmer is the Commissioner in charge of the reference.,77
NA,Because corporate or company insolvency is the subject,77
NA,"of State and Territorial legislation, the inquiry by the",77
NA,Commission will necessarily involve extensive consulta-,77
NA,tion with the States and the Northern Territory. The,77
NA,terms of reference relating to the inquiry expressly re-,77
NA,quire the Commission to consult with the States and the,77
NA,Northern Territory.,77
NA,The inquiry by the Commission will be necessarily a,77
NA,long one. Pending the completion of that inquiry and,77
NA,"the tabling of the report, the Government will consider",77
NA,amending the Bankruptcy Act where this is necessary.,77
NA,It is likely that amendments to the Bankruptcy Act will,77
NA,be introduced into the Parliament in the Budget Sitting.,77
NA,An announcement providing more details of the pro-,77
NA,posed amendments will be made at a later time.,77
NA,"Concerning the administration of the Bankruptcy Act,",77
NA,my Department is presently addressing the question of,77
NA,"a major review of the structure, organisation and meth-",77
NA,ods of Bankruptcy Branch of my Department. The,77
NA,terms of reference of the proposed review will be suffi-,77
NA,ciently wide so that all major issues of an administrative,77
NA,nature may be addressed.,77
NA,"(2) As mentioned above, the Australian Law Reform",77
NA,Commission is considering the question of the law and,77
NA,"of insolvency, both personal and corporate. I",77
NA,am unable to anticipate the Commission's findings by,77
NA,suggesting that the Commission will or will not recom-,77
NA,mend a restructuring of the Companies Code and its,77
NA,"administration. However, the Commission's inquiry is",77
NA,expected to address all the major issues relating to the,77
NA,law and practice of corporate insolvency.,77
NA,A number of amendments to the Companies Act and,77
NA,Codes which came into operation on 31 March 1986,77
NA,address the issue that you have raised. In particular I,77
NA,draw your attention to section 562A of the Companies,77
NA,Act and Codes which was inserted by section 123 of the,77
NA,Companies and Securities Legislation (Miscellaneous,77
NA,Amendments) Act 1985. This provision enables the,77
NA,NCSC to prohibit persons involved in the management,77
NA,of failed companies from taking part in the management,77
NA,of a corporation without their having obtained the leave,77
NA,of the Supreme Court.,77
NA,Brisbane International Airport,77
NA,(Question No. 3404),77
NA,"Mr Jull asked the Minister for Aviation, upon",77
NA,"the restructuring notice, on 14 March 1986:",77
NA,(I) What is the projected opening date of the new,77
NA,Brisbane International Airport.,77
NA,(2) Will the new airport operate without a curfew; if,77
NA,"not, why not.",77
NA,(3) Is consideration being given to a memorial to the,77
NA,"late Honourable K. M. Cairns, former Member for",77
NA,"Lilley, for his promotion of the new Brisbane Interna-",78
NA,tional Airport.,78
NA,(4) Would the naming of the new terminal building,78
NA,after Mr Cairns constitute an appropriate form of,78
NA,memorial.,78
NA,NA,78
NA,able member's question is as follows:,78
NA,( I) The target date for commissioning the new airport,78
NA,is September 1987.,78
NA,(2) The new airport will be curfew free.,78
NA,(3) I have received a number of representations on,78
NA,this subject. Consideration will be given to commemo-,78
NA,"rating the late Hon. K. M. Cairns, former Member for",78
NA,"Lilley, when the question of naming features associated",78
NA,with the new Brisbane airport is addressed.,78
NA,( 4) It is practice not to name airports or terminal,78
NA,"buildings after individuals, but to name them according",78
NA,to the major city that they serve.,78
NA,Tourism Overseas Promotion Scheme,78
NA,(Question No. 3669),78

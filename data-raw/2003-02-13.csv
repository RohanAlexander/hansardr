Mr ZAHRA ,MCMillan) (11.58 a.m.)-The,127

NA,into a substantial fire front and headed east,127
NA,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE,127

NA,too familiar with the geography of the Latrobe,128
NA,and a substantial threat to a large amount,128

NA,deal more specifically with it in due course. I,128
NA,a fair go about these things. We have just heard,128

NA,MCMillan has a number of avenues available,128

NA,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE,128
NA,"Thursday, 13 February 2003",129
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,The member for Mitchell,129
NA,"ters, and though we are all very compassionate",129
NA,back to the subject of the bill which we,129
Mr ZAHRA,"As I said, Madam Deputy Speaker,",129
NA,way that what the member for Mitchell was,129
NA,argue that what I am talking about is as relevant-probably,129
NA,and this is the last point that I want to make,129
NA,on record my appreciation and that of people,129
NA,all of the volunteer brigades and full-time,129
NA,just from the Latrobe Valley but also from West,129
NA,Sale and Wurruk in particular-and for their,129
NA,difficult circumstances.,129
NA,We are here to talk about the Family and,129
NA,2002. The bill deals with a substantial issue,129
NA,and tries to address some of the problems that,129
NA,handling of the family tax benefit and child-care,129
NA,issue. It has affected many thousands of families,129
NA,families in my electorate have had about the,129
NA,"which inadvertently, through no fault of their",129
NA,they end up owing the Commonwealth money.,129
NA,I know of many instances where people have,129
NA,formation to Centrelink. They have come forward,129
NA,"stance, and have still ended up with a debt",129
NA,grieved about this because they have not set,129
NA,"gone out of their way to be sneaky, to try to get",129
NA,"ordinary people who have put in for a benefit,",129
NA,somehow have ended up owing the Commonwealth,129
NA,feel that their honour has been impugned by,129
NA,"debt collector knocking on their door saying,",129
NA,feel they should have been put in a position,129
NA,"These people have done everything right, so",129
NA,been made to feel a certain way-as if they,129
NA,they have given all the information. I say fair,129
NA,they feel.,129
NA,A large number of people in my electorate,129
NA,"put in their tax returns, only to have the",129
NA,owed it-what the Commonwealth called an,129
NA,"As you would know, Madam Deputy Speaker, many",129
NA,refund and organise their budgets around it.,129
NA,"habit, when they get their tax cheque-people",129
NA,"fice, especially low income families-of using",129
NA,"ents. So not having that $500, $600 or $700",129
NA,electorate last year. A lot of people were very,129
NA,media in my electorate. Many families came,129
NA,that money directly from their tax cheques had,129
NA,MAIN COMMITTEE 11897,129
NA,"did refer, however, to family mat-",129
NA,about the bushfires I do ask that you come,129
NA,are all here today to discuss and debate.,129
NA,this does affect families. In the same,129
NA,"talking about was relevant to the bill, I would",129
NA,more relevant. As I was saying-,129
NA,in relation to the fires in my electorate-I place,129
NA,in the Latrobe Valley for the swift response from,129
NA,emergency service personnel who responded-not,129
NA,"Gippsland, South Gippsland and further east,",129
NA,efforts in coming to help us when we faced very,129
NA,Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill,129
NA,which has existed in my electorate for some time,129
NA,have been in place through the government's,129
NA,benefit arrangements. This is an important,129
NA,in my electorate. One of the big concerns,129
NA,administration of this program is the way in,129
NA,"own, they can be caught in a situation where",129
NA,done the right thing and given all the right in-,129
NA,when they have had a change of circum-,129
NA,to the Commonwealth. These people feel ag-,129
NA,out to defraud the Commonwealth. They have not,129
NA,a benefit they are not entitled to. They are just,129
NA,given Centrelink all of the information and,129
NA,money. They feel lousy about this. They,129
NA,the fact that they now have the Commonwealth,129
NA,‘You have to pay this money back.' They do not,129
NA,in the first place to have to pay the money back.,129
NA,probably they are right about that. They have,129
NA,have done the wrong thing-by people to whom,129
NA,enough to those people; I can understand how,129
NA,were given a nasty surprise last year when they,129
NA,amount of money which the Commonwealth said they,129
NA,‘overpayment'-stripped from their tax refund.,129
NA,families look forward to getting their tax,129
NA,Many families in my electorate have got into the,129
NA,usually get some money back from the tax of-,129
NA,that money to buy their kids Christmas pres-,129
NA,come in made a big difference to families in my,129
NA,concerned about it. It became a big issue in the,129
NA,forward and explained how the taking away of,129
NA,affected their budgets. It had meant that a lot,129
NA,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE,129
NA,11898,130
NA,"of the stuff they had planned, like presents for",130
NA,"for a little while, they could not do last year.",130
NA,because many people who try to do the right,130
NA,These are people who have tried to do everything,130
NA,Commonwealth and by Centrelink. They are basically,130
NA,vide some safety for those people in their,130
NA,link.,130
NA,An issue of concern in my electorate which,130
NA,been the issue of protecting their motor vehicles,130
NA,ethanol in fuel. It has been one of those interesting,130
NA,"an esoteric way. They say, ‘We should do this",130
NA,should do this because it's good for some other,130
NA,it.' A lot of families get affected by these,130
NA,"use those boats to go on holidays, and this issue",130
NA,"you have a boat that costs you $10,000, it",130
NA,"the repayments or to save up for it, and you",130
NA,not going to either be up for a replacement,130
NA,have saved long and hard for in the first place.,130
NA,My concern is that the way the government,130
NA,that there is no protection for families who have,130
NA,board motor. The government has not mandated,130
NA,lot of people are going to be caught up in this,130
NA,the engine in their motor vehicle damaged. It,130
NA,"lot of expense for people. Unfortunately, there",130
NA,motor vehicles or motorboat petrol with a higher,130
NA,engine or their outboard motor might be ruined,130
NA,of money which the people who have motor boats,130
NA,"is a fairly broad ranging debate, but it",130
The DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Ms Gambaro)-The,130
NA,he says that it is very broad ranging.,130
Mr ZAHRA,"Give me a bit of a fair go,",130
NA,member for Mitchell talk about his view,130
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,If the member for,130

NA,him a little more indulgence. But I remind him,130
NA,can.,130
Mr ZAHRA,I know that you are a fair,130
NA,matter which affects families. We are here to,130
NA,enough money to deal with some of the issues,130

NA,might not necessarily have. I know that this,130
NA,is an important issue which affects families-,130
NA,member for MCMillan is correct when,130
NA,"Again, I ask him to come back to the bill.",130
NA,Madam Deputy Speaker. We had to listen to the,130
NA,about single parents in the UK and the US.,130
NA,MCMillan could illustrate to me how etha-,130

NA,"which come up, which are consumer affairs",130
NA,"money to start with, if they have a boat then it",130
NA,really is stretching the patience of,130

NA,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE,130
NA,"Thursday, 13 February 2003",131
NA,of social security law and family law assistance.,131
NA,will bring you back to the content of the bill,131
NA,to the content of this bill. I am happy to provide,131
NA,"tance of the member for MCMillan, should he so wish.",131
Mr ZAHRA,You are a great source of,131
NA,"talk about matters to do with families, I think",131
NA,affects families. This bill affects families.,131
NA,hundreds of thousands of families who have,131
NA,issue for the many members who represent electorates,131
NA,affected by the changes which were put,131
NA,which led to a lot of people inadvertently ending,131
NA,point I am trying to make is that you cannot,131

Mr HUNT ,"Madam Deputy Speaker, on a",131

NA,tion.,131
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,The period of trial,131
NA,but I thank the member for Flinders. I hope,131
NA,they be reintroduced. I now call on the member,131
NA,Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2002.,131
Mr ZAHRA,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I am happy",131
NA,of the bill. The simple point that I was making,131
NA,tion. In the same way that people-,131
NA,Honourable members interjecting-,131
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,I certainly agree,131
NA,"very global view of the bill, but",131
Mr ZAHRA,I would not say global; I would,131
NA,you take the viewpoint of a family,131
NA,Ms Julie Bishop-I raise a point of order:,131
NA,in time. He clearly has not read the bill. He,131
NA,suggest that he stand aside and allow a member,131
NA,bate the bill the opportunity to,131
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,I thank the member,131
NA,"Ms Burke-There was no point of order,",131
NA,MAIN COMMITTEE 11899,131
NA,"If you wish to speak to the topic of that bill, I",131
NA,and ask that you speak about families in relation,131
NA,further technical information for the assis-,131
NA,"information, Madam Deputy Speaker. When we",131
NA,it is important that we look at everything that,131
NA,There has been a lot of talk in the media about the,131
NA,been affected by this bill. This has been a big,131
NA,in which a large number of people are,131
NA,in place by the Commonwealth government and,131
NA,up with debts to the Commonwealth. But the,131
NA,view these things in isolation. Families are under,131
NA,"pressure, and they are under increasing financial",131
NA,financial pressure is what the Commonwealth,131
NA,and child-care benefits. One of the other reasons,131
NA,is how much things cost under the GST. Another,131
NA,pressure is if they end up with an expensive re-,131
NA,motor. We know that that would place a significant,131
NA,a similar situation to the type of circumstance,131
NA,"through no fault of their own, end up with a",131
NA,"point of order, I wonder whether the member",131
NA,new standing orders so that I may pose a ques-,131
NA,"for the new standing orders is now over,",131
NA,he can avail himself of the opportunity should,131

NA,is that you cannot view these things in isola-,131
NA,that the member for MCMillan is taking a,131

NA,"say more of a local view. For example, if",131
NA,living in a place like Wonthaggi-,131

The SPEAKER , Mr David Hawker),17
NA,took the chair at 12.30 p.m. and read prayers.,17
NA,MEMBER SWORN,17
NA,Ms Sophie Panopoulos made and sub-,17
NA,scribed the oath of allegiance.,17
NA,GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH,17
NA,Address-in-Reply,17
NA,"Debate resumed from 18 November, on",17
NA,motion by Mrs Markus:,17
NA,That the address be agreed to.,17
Mr JULL ,Fadden) (12.32 p.m.)-The,17
NA,"Governor-General, in his speech to the",17
NA,"House, made particular reference to the gov-",17
NA,ernment's initiatives in terms of overseas,17
NA,trade. I would like to inform the House of,17
NA,importance of that in my electorate of,17
NA,"Fadden. As I have mentioned previously, the",17
NA,seat of Fadden encompasses the Gold Coast.,17
NA,While the Gold Coast continues to be a,17
NA,"foremost tourist destination, and tourism and",17
NA,"hospitality are the chief money earners, I",17
NA,wonder if there is a realisation within the,17
NA,federal bureaucracy that the income gener-,17
NA,ated by the tourism industry may not last for,17
NA,very much longer. The reality is that the,17
NA,Gold Coast is becoming very much a focal,17
NA,point for export industries for Australia.,17
NA,I would like to mention to the House just,17
NA,some of the things that are happening. For,17
NA,"example, the film industry which is based at",17
NA,Oxenford is now creating films for world-,17
NA,wide distribution. It is not only Australian,17
NA,productions which are being made; a number,17
NA,of American productions are also being,17
NA,made. The flow-on affect of that is tremen-,17
NA,dous. There are editing houses and specialty,17
NA,audio suites which have been established as,17
NA,well as specialty legal firms which deal in,17
NA,patents and copyright in association with,17
NA,particular industry. While the industry has,17
NA,had a bit of a down time in the past 12,17
NA,"months, the forward projections on produc-",17
NA,tions look absolutely tremendous.,17
NA,There has also been the advent of the Gold,17
NA,"Coast Marina, which is now a major luxury",17
NA,"shipbuilder. Last year, the income generated",17
NA,from that through exports was in the vicinity,17
NA,of $250 million. Estimates are that this year,17
NA,"it could be as high as $400 million, with",17
NA,principal markets being places like Fort,17
NA,Lauderdale in the United States. A new in-,17
NA,"dustrial estate has been established at Yatala,",17
NA,in the northern area of the Gold Coast. Along,17
NA,"with our Austrade people, I have been under-",17
NA,taking some visits to a number of the manu-,17
NA,facturers there. There is a pet food company,17
NA,there-a $50 million business-that has now,17
NA,gone into the export of chilled pet food,17
NA,throughout Asia. It is estimated that its in-,17
NA,"the come, particularly through these exports, is",17
NA,going to double within the next 12 months to,17
NA,two years. A smallgoods manufacturer has,17
NA,started exporting to Japan. There is only one,17
NA,"buyer, but that will amount to up to 30 ton-",17
NA,nes of specialist sausages for the Kyoto mar-,17
NA,ket from 5 January next year.,17
NA,Jewellery manufacturing has taken on,17
NA,quite an image on the Gold Coast. One par-,17
NA,"ticular manufacturer there, based at Sanctu-",17
NA,"ary Cove, is now exporting around the world.",17
NA,We have the largest producer of computer,17
NA,games in the Asia-Pacific area. It is a com-,17
NA,"pany that employs 250 people, 170 of whom",17
NA,are graduates. It supplies video games and,17
NA,computer games to all areas of the Asia-,17
NA,Pacific except Japan. It is no wonder that,17
NA,"something like 60,000 people employed in",17
NA,Fadden actually live in Fadden. It is no won-,17
NA,der that our unemployment rates are some of,17
NA,the lowest in Australia. The Gold Coast is,17
NA,virtually becoming a focal point for high-,17
NA,tech international manufacturing. As we have,17
NA,"seen in recent times, we have got to a stage",17
NA,that now where we have actually had to import,17
NA,"labour from South Australia, from the old",17
NA,"Mitsubishi plant, to meet some of the re-",18
NA,quirements.,18
NA,"In fact, throughout the electorate we are",18
NA,finding that one of the greatest difficulties,18
NA,that we have is getting skilled labour. In that,18
NA,"respect, the announcement of a technical",18
NA,college that will be built and operated by the,18
NA,Commonwealth to meet those specific needs,18
NA,"is especially welcome. The Gold Coast is, as",18
NA,"I said, very much a focal point for this. What",18
NA,we have seen is a spin-off into our educa-,18
NA,tional institutions. After the recent redistriburequired,18
NA,"tion, I have inherited the Gold Coast campus",18
NA,of Griffith University from my colleague the,18
NA,member for Moncrieff. To give you an ex-,18
NA,"ample of what happens there, a whole new",18
NA,music division has been established specifi-,18
NA,cally to meet the digital music requirements,18
NA,of the movie production houses. That is a,18
NA,"huge business, with five sound stages now",18
NA,based at Griffith University all going flat-out,18
NA,producing graduates who have the opportu-,18
NA,nity to go into areas such as the film industry,18
NA,and the video games industry with digital,18
NA,"music, which is really quite unlike anything",18
NA,"that we have seen before. Quite proudly,",18
NA,Griffith University boasts of the fact that,18
NA,something like four of its graduates have,18
NA,been picked up by Hollywood already be-,18
NA,cause of the standard of student that it is,18
NA,ducing there.,18
NA,"As I said, we must have realised within",18
NA,the government that the Gold Coast is no,18
NA,longer just froth and bubble. It is not just an,18
NA,area that caters for tourism; it is very much,18
NA,becoming the specialist manufacturing heart,18
NA,of Australia. With the expansion of Brisbane,18
NA,"airport, we have a major requirement now",18
NA,for specialist aviation engineering people.,18
NA,While a lot of that training is being done in a,18
NA,"new school that has been established, with",18
NA,"government help, at Brisbane airport, all the",18
NA,Queensland universities are very much in-,18
NA,volved now in producing graduates who will,18
NA,have the capacity to go for the highly techni-,18
NA,cal jobs that will come with the advent of the,18
NA,new Qantas 767 maintenance base. There is,18
NA,also talk of a joint facility being set up be-,18
NA,tween Qantas and Singapore Airlines for the,18
NA,maintenance and work involved with the,18
NA,new A380 aircraft.,18
NA,So there are exciting times on the Gold,18
NA,Coast. Employment levels are very high. The,18
NA,demand for labour is immense. While we,18
NA,"speak of technical areas, we have only to",18
NA,look at the building industry to see what is,18
NA,there. I understand from the Master,18
NA,Builders Association that at the moment,18
NA,"there are some 2,300 apprenticeships going",18
NA,within the building industry. The situation,18
NA,has become so drastic and there is such a,18
NA,requirement for qualified builders that a,18
NA,third-year apprentice in the building industry,18
NA,"at the moment, if that person is good, has the",18
NA,"capacity to draw something like $100,000 a",18
NA,"year. So the Gold Coast is, I think, probably",18
NA,the most exciting part of Australia at the,18
NA,moment. It is exciting because it is very,18
NA,"much an international city, but it is most ex-",18
NA,citing because of the tremendous contribu-,18
NA,tion it is making to the development of Aus-,18
NA,tralia.,18
The SPEAKER,Order! Before I call the,18
NA,"honourable member for Watson, Mr Burke, I",18
NA,pro- remind the House that this is the honourable,18
NA,member's first speech. I ask the House to,18
NA,extend to him the usual courtesies.,18
Mr BURKE ,Watson) (12.39 p.m.)- Mr,18
NA,"Speaker, it is hard to believe I am here. This",18
NA,is the room where the arguments of the na-,18
NA,"tion come to a head, the room where the",18
NA,government of the nation is determined and,18
NA,the room where all the diverse opinions,18
NA,throughout Australia are broken down to 150,18
NA,voices. To be selected by the community to,18
NA,be one of those 150 voices is an extraordi-,18
NA,nary honour. It is the community where I,18
NA,"have grown up, where my parents grew up",18
NA,and now where my own family is growing,18
NA,up so quickly. It means the world to me to,19
NA,"see them all here today: my wife, Cathy, who",19
NA,had the right of veto as to whether I would,19
NA,run for federal parliament and who has of-,19
NA,fered nothing but love and support in the,19
NA,"many years that have led to today, and my",19
NA,three gorgeous daughters. Liana is in the,19
NA,"lery, and Caitlyn and Helena are carefully",19
NA,"positioned behind soundproof glass! Mum,",19
NA,"Dad, Rosemary, Sharon, and Michael:",19
NA,whether it was as your youngest child or lit-,19
NA,"tle brother, every supportive comment has",19
NA,helped me to get here and all the other com-,19
NA,ments just count as training.,19
NA,The campaign for Watson was run by Ari,19
NA,"Margossian, the National President of Young",19
NA,"Labor, with the ever present strategic advice",19
NA,of Morris Iemma. With so many volunteers,19
NA,"to thank, I want to acknowledge all my",19
NA,friends on the campaign team and every,19
NA,branch member. I particularly want to thank,19
NA,those who were there every single day:,19
NA,"Maria Iannotti, Vince Badalati, Wilma",19
NA,"Hickey, Claire Haig, Peter Papodopoulos and",19
NA,Chris Taylor. I also thank Greg Donnelly and,19
NA,everyone from the SDA. A particular thank,19
NA,you to those friends who helped form Watson,19
NA,Young Labor Association more than 10 years,19
NA,"ago, who made all this possible.",19
NA,Campaigns are not only fought at a local,19
NA,level. In only 10 months Mark Latham did a,19
NA,great job to raise the spirits of Labor sup-,19
NA,porters and ensure that the party were seri-,19
NA,ously competitive as we moved into the cam-,19
NA,paign. I also note the improved result in New,19
NA,South Wales and congratulate my good,19
NA,friends Mark Arbib and Karl Bitar on their,19
NA,roles in the campaign. A number of good,19
NA,friends ran in marginal seats and some,19
NA,missed out in difficult circumstances. I want,19
NA,"to acknowledge their effort, commitment and",19
NA,talent. They have been friends for some time,19
NA,and I look forward to calling them parlia-,19
NA,mentary colleagues in the years ahead.,19
NA,The local area now covered by the seat of,19
NA,Watson was well represented in this chamber,19
NA,for 25 years by Leo MCLeay. He served this,19
NA,chamber as both Speaker and Chief Gov-,19
NA,ernment Whip. After the election I came,19
NA,"down here to set up my office and, as I",19
NA,"galwalked through the Members Hall, it dawned",19
NA,on me that it had really happened: Leo had in,19
NA,fact retired and I was now the member for,19
NA,Watson. As I walked along through the,19
NA,Members Hall I noticed out of the corner of,19
NA,my eye the framed pictures on the walls and,19
NA,glanced up to see who they were of. And,19
NA,"there he was, staring straight back at me-a",19
NA,"portrait of Leo MCLeay, still here and still",19
NA,"watching me. Leo, I wish you and Janice",19
NA,well for the years ahead.,19
NA,I am in the unusual position of delivering,19
NA,my second first speech. Only last year I had,19
NA,the chance to deliver my first speech to the,19
NA,New South Wales Legislative Council. This,19
NA,year I deliver another first speech. Next year,19
NA,I will not. This will be my final first speech.,19
NA,But in introducing myself to a new parlia-,19
NA,"ment, I have not changed all that radically in",19
NA,"a year. So, for the friends here who heard my",19
NA,"last first speech, there will be some moments",19
NA,that will be familiar. Sorry about that. I can-,19
NA,not help it-it is the same me.,19
NA,There have been a number of articles writ-,19
NA,ten and speeches made over the last 10 years,19
NA,which have profiled the previous careers of,19
NA,members of the House of Representatives.,19
NA,There have even been check lists in some of,19
NA,the more recent articles that said how terrible,19
NA,it is that so many federal MPs have previ-,19
NA,"ously worked as lawyers, teachers, staffers,",19
NA,state members of parliament and union offi-,19
NA,cials. On that list I score four out of five. I,19
NA,"have never been a teacher, although the busi-",19
NA,"ness I ran did do training, so I might be able",19
NA,to stretch the definition and still get to full,19
NA,marks. I have no intention of trying to rein-,19
NA,vent myself here today. I have great pride in,19
NA,the work I have done and the people I have,19
NA,helped. There have been two main themes in,20
NA,my own working life and upbringing: small,20
NA,business and trade unions. You will not find,20
NA,me ever walking away from either.,20
NA,Dad opened a small business in River-,20
NA,"wood when he was 27, and he stayed there",20
NA,until he retired. The sign in Belmore Road,20
NA,still reads ‘Burke's Riverwood Pharmacy'. I,20
NA,grew up with no knowledge of the term ‘nine,20
NA,"to five', and I never understood small busi-",20
NA,ness as being where you worked for yourself.,20
NA,Dad was employed by a few thousand cus-,20
NA,tomers. He felt a real sense of service and,20
NA,"obligation to each of them, and a handful of",20
NA,those customers knew how to be extremely,20
NA,tough employers. I remember dinner being,20
NA,postponed more often than not because extra,20
NA,customers had arrived at the exact moment,20
NA,Dad was about to close the shop for the,20
NA,night. I remember vividly Dad sitting at the,20
NA,dining table at night as I went to bed while,20
NA,he completed the streams of paperwork that,20
NA,were required while Mum sat at the other,20
NA,end of the table marking work for her stu-,20
NA,dents at school.,20
NA,We had all the small business themes: the,20
NA,frustration of mounting paperwork; the pres-,20
NA,"sure of government paying its bills to us late,",20
NA,when every creditor was demanding we pay,20
NA,them on time; and the difficulties associated,20
NA,with ever being able to organise time off,20
NA,when the business was your own. Do not get,20
NA,me wrong; I had a very fortunate upbringing.,20
NA,These were never crisis issues; they were just,20
NA,"part of every day life. By simple, understated",20
NA,"example, my parents taught me a work ethic",20
NA,which I have never let go.,20
NA,I had the satisfaction of forming my own,20
NA,business some years ago with Ben Richards,20
NA,and Ray D'Cruz whom I had met through,20
NA,debating. Aticus Pty Ltd still runs success-,20
NA,"fully, providing public speaking and advo-",20
NA,cacy training around Australia and into vari-,20
NA,ous parts of South-East Asia. To have been,20
NA,"there from the start-planning the business,",20
NA,dealing with the bureaucracy that comes with,20
NA,incorporation-and going through the initial,20
NA,period of diversification while we gradually,20
NA,established the core business was an exciting,20
NA,and valuable time. To see the business still,20
NA,flourishing years later is a fantastic reward,20
NA,"for the effort we all put in at the start, par-",20
NA,ticularly the drive and commitment shown,20
NA,by Ray and Ben in seeing the importance and,20
NA,power of encouraging people to not only,20
NA,hold opinions but to advocate them.,20
NA,"During my time with Aticus, and while we",20
NA,went through that early period of diversifica-,20
NA,"tion, I became involved in lobbying two is-",20
NA,sues which found supporters on both sides of,20
NA,"this chamber. As a result, I formed many",20
NA,friendships early on with various caucus,20
NA,"members, and I have enjoyed a good work-",20
NA,ing relationship with the member for Men-,20
NA,zies and the member for Wentworth. I sin-,20
NA,cerely hope it is not long before their party,20
NA,recognises their talent and allows both of,20
NA,them the opportunity which is already mine:,20
NA,to serve in this chamber as a shadow minis-,20
NA,ter.,20
NA,"My first job, and my first involvement",20
NA,"with unions, was delivering the Sunday pa-",20
NA,pers for the Beverly Hills Newsagency.,20
NA,There was a grave injustice there: we were,20
NA,receiving 10 per cent commission while,20
NA,other shops were all paying 12½ per cent. I,20
NA,"organised the other paperboys and said,",20
NA,‘Let's form a union.' We worked out our de-,20
NA,"mands, but when I took them to the boss, he",20
NA,would not listen. He said we could not be a,20
NA,union because we had not charged fees. So,20
NA,"everyone threw in a copper coin, and I went",20
NA,back to negotiate. It was a comprehensive,20
NA,"log of claims: 12½ per cent commission, an",20
NA,extra $1 every time it rained and free food,20
NA,for a Christmas party. He came back with the,20
NA,"typical response, ‘Why should I give you lot",20
NA,that?' I can still hear my 12-year-old voice,20
NA,"answering him: ‘If you don't, we'll have a",20
NA,paperboy picket line out the front of the,21
NA,shop. The TV cameras will turn up because,21
NA,they'll think it's really funny. We'll be on,21
NA,"TV, so we'll feel really important. The cus-",21
NA,tomers will know it's your shop and you'll,21
NA,look really bad.' He gave in to all three de-,21
NA,"mands. To celebrate, we spent the union fees",21
NA,on mixed lollies.,21
NA,"Years later, I became a full-time official",21
NA,with the union I first joined as a checkout,21
NA,operator with Grace Bros: the SDA. While,21
NA,"the fees were more than a copper coin, the",21
NA,methods of workplace organising through,21
NA,local delegates and giving people a direct,21
NA,stake in the outcomes achieved were not all,21
NA,that different.,21
NA,It is bizarre that there have been speeches,21
NA,in this chamber claiming that the sort of,21
NA,work union officials do is not real work; that,21
NA,people like me do not get real world experi-,21
NA,"ence during those years. Seriously, does any-",21
NA,one actually believe that I would have had,21
NA,"more real world experience if, instead, I had",21
NA,utilised my law degree to represent the same,21
NA,people on the same issues but charged them a,21
NA,couple of hundred dollars an hour to meet,21
NA,with me in some solicitor's office with,21
NA,dodgy wood panelling and terminally ill,21
NA,goldfish? The critics of trade unionists enter-,21
NA,ing parliament speak as though unionism,21
NA,was a single industry where we spend our,21
NA,days in the same sorts of union offices doing,21
NA,"the same sort of job, and that we bring the",21
NA,same life experiences to parliament. As an,21
NA,"organiser, I did not have an office-I did not",21
NA,even have a desk. My workplace was wher-,21
NA,ever my members worked. My meeting,21
NA,rooms would be at Flemings at Bexley or,21
NA,Big W at Campsie. My lunch room would be,21
NA,the food courts at Roselands or at Hurstville.,21
NA,My desk would be whatever box I might,21
NA,have to lean on in that KFC at William,21
NA,"Street, Earlwood.",21
NA,I look around this chamber and am as,21
NA,proud to be among those with a union back-,21
NA,ground as I am to be among those with a,21
NA,small business background. Just as business,21
NA,"varies radically from one sector to another,",21
NA,so does the experience of union officials.,21
NA,What we bring in common is experience,21
NA,from the front line of the concerns and aspi-,21
NA,rations of people in every industry. Their,21
NA,workplaces have been our workplaces. For,21
NA,those who want to use the ‘not a real job',21
NA,"line, I can only say that when I met with",21
NA,night fillers in the early hours of the morning,21
NA,"to uncover systematic underpayments, it felt",21
NA,like a real job; when I visited fast food out-,21
NA,lets on weekends and found that cost savings,21
NA,had been extended to not replenishing the,21
NA,"first aid kit, with one manager telling 15-",21
NA,year-old employees to use serviettes and,21
NA,"sticky tape as a substitute for bandaids, it felt",21
NA,like a real job; and when I negotiated roster,21
NA,changes for employees such as one who had,21
NA,been given a roster which would have seen,21
NA,him working nine hours during the only day,21
NA,he had access to his children or for another,21
NA,who would have had to leave her young,21
NA,children unsupervised had the original roster,21
NA,"gone ahead, not only did it feel like a real job",21
NA,"to me, I reckon those employees and every",21
NA,member of their families thought the job I,21
NA,was doing was pretty real too.,21
NA,And none of these outcomes were,21
NA,achieved through aggression. Like any other,21
NA,"organiser, I would sit down with the member,",21
NA,the delegate and management and we would,21
NA,"work through the problem. All day, every",21
NA,"day, managers and business owners would be",21
NA,"explaining their pressures, their constraints-",21
NA,often explaining those pressures far more,21
NA,candidly to me than they would to their own,21
NA,head office. We would arrive at sensible so-,21
NA,lutions that everyone could work with.,21
NA,I have read the Hansard of some of the,21
NA,debates in this chamber and have to smile at,21
NA,"the claims that, for people like myself, the",21
NA,involvement with unions is an albatross,22
NA,around our necks. Around the neck is not the,22
NA,way you wear a badge of honour. I will al-,22
NA,ways wear my history with small business,22
NA,and my history with unions the same way.,22
NA,There is not a day of my employment history,22
NA,I would ever want to change.,22
NA,I value every moment I spent in the state,22
NA,"parliament, and thank those friends from the",22
NA,state parliament who have come down today.,22
NA,"To be part of Bob Carr's government, to",22
NA,chair the State Development Committee and,22
NA,to work in Macquarie Street with a group of,22
NA,life-long friends was a real privilege. Yet for hurt.,22
NA,"me, right here is where I have wanted to",22
NA,work for a long time. I know you lose the,22
NA,intimacy and the intensity of those New,22
NA,South Wales debating chambers and that this,22
NA,is a lonelier place for members in many,22
NA,"ways, but there is something about the fed-",22
NA,eral parliament that goes way beyond the,22
NA,legislation we pass here and way beyond our,22
NA,constitutional powers. I realised this one day,22
NA,about eight years ago when Cathy came,22
NA,home from work and told me the children,22
NA,were playing differently at the community,22
NA,based child-care centre where she taught and,22
NA,racist taunts had suddenly crept into the,22
NA,guage of the children as they played. It did,22
NA,not happen because any law had changed. It,22
NA,did not happen because of government,22
NA,spending. It happened because a speech had,22
NA,been made by an Independent member in this,22
NA,chamber which was seen to legitimise racist,22
NA,comment in the name of free speech. There,22
NA,is something about what is said in this cham-,22
NA,"ber that changes the mood of the nation, that",22
NA,gives us a role in affecting how Australians,22
NA,relate to each other. Just as we have the ca-,22
NA,pacity here to run our politics in ways that,22
NA,appeal to the worst of the attitudes in Austraworking,22
NA,"lia, we have the capacity to appeal to the",22
NA,as well.,22
NA,When we acknowledge the incredible,22
NA,strength and richness of the many cultures,22
NA,"which make our nation so vibrant, from In-",22
NA,digenous Australians through to the most,22
NA,"recent immigrant, it has an impact on how",22
NA,Australians relate to each other at the work-,22
NA,"place, in the shopping centre and in the play-",22
NA,"ground. When members of this chamber talk,",22
NA,very few people tune in and certainly none of,22
NA,the under-fives in that Greenacre playground,22
NA,"listen to the broadcasts, but somehow the",22
NA,message gets out. When members here de-,22
NA,"mean others, divide communities and vilify",22
NA,"some of the most vulnerable people, those",22
NA,people do not have to be listening to feel the,22
NA,No matter how many pet issues an indi-,22
NA,"vidual member can bring to this chamber, so",22
NA,much of what we have to address is deter-,22
NA,mined by the pressure of the period of his-,22
NA,tory in which we find ourselves here. I be-,22
NA,lieve there are three overarching themes,22
NA,which will dominate the lives of anyone in-,22
NA,volved in the battle of ideas over the next,22
NA,"generation: the ageing population, climate",22
NA,change and globalisation. Some of the im-,22
NA,pacts of a lower birth rate combined with an,22
NA,increased life expectancy have already been,22
NA,well documented and discussed broadly. We,22
NA,lan- all know the subsequent importance of na-,22
NA,tional savings and the pressures which flow,22
NA,to our health and welfare systems.,22
NA,There is an added impact which is consid-,22
NA,ered too rarely. We have an education system,22
NA,which is designed to cater for the demo-,22
NA,graphic make-up of Australians more than 40,22
NA,years ago. By and large our education system,22
NA,presumes you can receive all the qualifica-,22
NA,tions you need well before you turn 25 and,22
NA,"then you are set for life, but an ageing popu-",22
NA,"lation will see people wanting, and in some",22
NA,"cases needing, to have a significantly longer",22
NA,"life, and technological change will",22
NA,best create an ongoing need for the update of,22
NA,skills. Many methods of continuing educa-,22
NA,"tion are poorly planned, impractical for peo-",22
NA,ple who are already balancing work and fam-,22
NA,"ily commitments, and way too expensive for",23
NA,people under modern financial pressures.,23
NA,For the last four years I have served as,23
NA,President of Bankstown Community College,23
NA,and have seen the value of affordable short,23
NA,"courses, not only for their content but for",23
NA,trying to ensure that people do not forget,23
NA,how to learn. I will never forget when the,23
NA,Lakemba Franklins store was for sale and,23
NA,one of the staff members was worried about,23
NA,"her future employment. She said, ‘Tony, if",23
NA,"only I'd learnt how to type, but it's too late",23
NA,now.' Even though she ended up with secure,23
NA,"employment in retail, the words she spoke",23
NA,still sound a warning for anyone who be-,23
NA,lieves lifelong learning is just a luxury. As,23
NA,the skills shortage intensifies and our popula-,23
NA,tion ages it will become an economic neces-,23
NA,sity.,23
NA,When I first joined the Labor Party all the,23
NA,environmental issues were about saving,23
NA,"iconic sites: the Franklin, the Daintree,",23
NA,Kakadu. Climate change moves any envi-,23
NA,ronmental debate to a new plane. The impli-,23
NA,"cations for water, salinity, the viability",23
NA,"many industries, and consequent issues in",23
NA,"trade and health, right through to bushfire",23
NA,"and natural disaster, all combine to move the",23
NA,debate on. The arguments over the causes of,23
NA,climate change or even questioning the exis-,23
NA,tence of climate change are all fast becoming,23
NA,conversations of the past. The responses,23
NA,need to occur at each level of government,23
NA,and our international role needs to be taken,23
NA,seriously. The tired old stunts of bashing the,23
NA,UN and refusing to sign international agree-,23
NA,ments have reached their use-by dates. There,23
NA,is too much at stake to get this one wrong.,23
NA,In any discussion about globalisation I,23
NA,should start by making clear that I am not,23
NA,afraid of it-not a bit. The growth in interna-,23
NA,tional campaigns on human rights has oc-,23
NA,curred hand in hand with globalisation. It is,23
NA,the strongest pressure on many nations to lift,23
NA,their game and open up the rights of their,23
NA,citizens as they open up their economies. It,23
NA,the was Labor that lowered the tariffs and intro-,23
NA,duced the competition reforms which began,23
NA,the process of breaking down the cartels,23
NA,which had shut out new businesses and pre-,23
NA,vented families from spending their income,23
NA,on fairly priced goods. This gave families a,23
NA,real increase in buying power-effectively a,23
NA,pay rise without a tax increase-thanks to,23
NA,the Labor reforms of the eighties and nine-,23
NA,ties.,23
NA,We have to make sure that in pursuing the,23
NA,improvements available to people as con-,23
NA,sumers we do not now sacrifice their dignity,23
NA,at work. No-one should have any pride in the,23
NA,rate of casualisation. Anyone who thinks that,23
NA,it is all about voluntary flexibility on the part,23
NA,of employees should come with me to a local,23
NA,"supermarket at one o'clock in the morning,",23
NA,go to a coffee shop the next day and see the,23
NA,"same people working, and then go again to",23
NA,find the same people working as domestic,23
NA,cleaners or mowing lawns in a scramble to,23
NA,of so find the hours that used to be available,23
NA,through full-time work.,23
NA,The flexibility that comes with upskilling,23
NA,is an important boost to productivity but that,23
NA,flexibility will always have a limit. Paying,23
NA,"bills is not flexible, the mortgage and rent are",23
NA,not flexible and the demand to feed the fam-,23
NA,ily will never be flexible. I have seen peo-,23
NA,ple's personal lives thrown into chaos by,23
NA,shifts suddenly disappearing or by one roster,23
NA,change meaning that the second job is no,23
NA,longer viable. The world will force us to con-,23
NA,tinue to embrace competition and to be flexi-,23
NA,ble with skills development. There are many,23
NA,"great benefits along that road, but if the word",23
NA,‘dignity' drops out of workplaces on the way,23
NA,through then we are missing some essential,23
NA,Australian values.,23
NA,Do not get me wrong. For all the opportu-,23
NA,nity that comes with being a member of this,23
NA,House I also recognise that being in opposi-,24
NA,tion has nothing going for it. Five months,24
NA,ago I was in government. I am 100 per cent,24
NA,"glad I went federal, but I do want to do",24
NA,something about the seating plan here. We,24
NA,become involved in the political system to,24
NA,make changes. We run for this parliament to,24
NA,affect the nation. Policy development is only,24
NA,ever the prologue. The real work is about,24
NA,implementation: reaching people and im-,24
NA,proving their lives. I have never believed in,24
NA,the nobility of defeat. I do believe in the,24
NA,pacity of the Labor Party to lift the,24
NA,this nation and lead Australia forward. Our,24
NA,job is to win: to implement the policies we,24
NA,"offer, to provide fresh opportunities while",24
NA,supporting the most vulnerable and to see,24
NA,reward for excellence without ever deserting,24
NA,those in genuine need.,24
NA,My predecessor was a member of this,24
NA,House for 25 years. If I manage the same,24
NA,length of service and spend only the first,24
NA,three years in opposition then there will be a,24
NA,reasonable chance to contribute. When I,24
NA,worked here in 1993 every commentator was,24
NA,saying how invincible we were. They soon,24
NA,"said the same about Jeff Kennett. In fact, in",24
NA,recent years the pattern has been that most,24
NA,Australian governments do look invincible at,24
NA,the start of their final term. Three years of,24
NA,effective hard work stands between Labor,24
NA,and government-work to which Labor has,24
NA,"an absolute commitment, work which is al-",24
NA,"ready under way, work which I am honoured",24
NA,to have a direct role in. I realise that this,24
NA,the only time that the House observes the,24
NA,courtesy of no-one interjecting during a,24
NA,speech. Good. There is a battle of ideas that I,24
NA,desperately want to be involved in and this is,24
NA,the perfect room to have it out in open de-,24
NA,"bate. Mr Speaker, bring it on.",24
The SPEAKER,Order! Before I call Mr,24
NA,"Robb, I remind honourable members that this",24
NA,is his first speech. I therefore ask that the,24
NA,usual courtesies be extended to him.,24
Mr ROBB ,Goldstein) (1.00 p.m.)-From,24
NA,"as early as I can remember, my mother and",24
NA,father instilled in me and my eight brothers,24
NA,and sisters that opportunity and freedom,24
NA,"would come through education, personal",24
NA,responsibility and self-belief; that our destiny,24
NA,was largely in our own hands-how hard we,24
NA,"studied and worked, the opportunities we",24
NA,"took, how we dealt with people. I grew to",24
NA,believe that I was responsible for charting,24
NA,my own course-that I was free to follow,24
NA,"ca- my dreams, make my own mistakes, take the",24
NA,spirits of consequences of my decisions.,24
NA,"Importantly, my parents never seemed to",24
NA,convey any resentment or jealousy that oth-,24
NA,ers might have more than we had. There was,24
NA,"no chip on the shoulder; rather, a notion of",24
NA,"‘blue sky', a sense that if we really wanted",24
NA,what others had-whatever that might be-,24
NA,then the opportunity was there to achieve it.,24
NA,"Ambition was presented as a good thing,",24
NA,"something to be nurtured and applauded, and",24
NA,not only in sport. I embraced these simple,24
NA,"truths as a philosophy, elements that I later",24
NA,came to see as best captured by the Liberal,24
NA,Party philosophy.,24
NA,So there was no road to Damascus for me,24
NA,in my support for the Liberal philosophy. It,24
NA,"evolved and owed most to my parents, which",24
NA,to some would seem surprising given their,24
NA,background. Many other life experiences,24
NA,have served to further entrench but also add,24
NA,to these principles or a set of ‘tram tracks'-,24
NA,a set of ‘tram tracks' that guide daily my re-,24
NA,is sponses to issues and events and will help to,24
NA,direct my response to matters in this House.,24
NA,I come to this place keen to put my ex-,24
NA,perience to good use and proud to represent,24
NA,all the people of Goldstein and I come very,24
NA,conscious of the trust they have placed in,24
NA,me. I intend that they will be well repre-,24
NA,sented. I am also conscious of the wonderful,24
NA,support for my campaign from so many Lib-,24
NA,"erals in Goldstein, under the very able direc-",24
NA,"tion of my campaign director, Jeannette",25
NA,Rawlinson.,25
NA,"Vida Goldstein, after whom my electorate",25
NA,"is named, was Victoria's foremost suffragist",25
NA,"for two decades, standing for parliament in",25
NA,1903-the first woman in the British Empire,25
NA,to do so. Vida was a woman of achievement,25
NA,"and conviction, as befits the people of my",25
NA,electorate. Vida grew up in the Western Dis-,25
NA,"trict of Victoria, like another accomplished",25
NA,"woman in my life: my wife, Maureen. I ac-",25
NA,knowledge the presence today in the gallery,25
NA,"of Maureen and our children, Tom, Joe and",25
NA,Pip. They are my strength.,25
NA,On this occasion I am also mindful of the,25
NA,outstanding service given to the people of,25
NA,"Goldstein by my predecessor, Dr David",25
NA,"Kemp, over 14 years. David, a man of great",25
NA,"intellect, integrity and endeavour, should be",25
NA,justly proud of his wonderful contribution to,25
NA,public policy over more than three decades. I,25
NA,suspect and hope that David's contribution is,25
NA,not yet finished.,25
NA,I bring to this place 33 years of work ex-,25
NA,"perience, with 20 years in and around the",25
NA,political process. I have worked in the public,25
NA,"sector, the private sector and the very private",25
NA,sector-the political machine. In the early to,25
NA,"mid-eighties, I was the chief executive of the",25
NA,Cattle Council of Australia and then the Na-,25
NA,tional Farmers Federation. During those,25
NA,years I was involved in negotiating federal,25
NA,land rights legislation pertaining to the,25
NA,Northern Territory.,25
NA,"As it turned out, the land rights legislation",25
NA,was a totally inadequate response to the real,25
NA,"issue-namely, the collapse of personal dig-",25
NA,nity and self-esteem among many Aborigi-,25
NA,"nals, particularly the young. In seeking to",25
NA,"come to grips with Indigenous issues, I spent",25
NA,"many, many weeks over a period of years in",25
NA,"the Northern Territory, the Kimberley and",25
NA,"North Queensland talking to cattlemen, to",25
NA,"businesspeople, to officials and to other lo-",25
NA,cals. I visited Aboriginal settlements and,25
NA,outback towns.,25
NA,"On many occasions, I would be taken to a",25
NA,bend in a river on a cattle station and shown,25
NA,"where 100, 200 or 300 Aboriginals had lived",25
NA,"for decades, with the men employed on the",25
NA,"stations as stockmen and drovers, the older",25
NA,"men as gardeners, and the women in the",25
NA,"homestead. In many cases, schools were",25
NA,provided for the children. Aboriginal people,25
NA,"were disadvantaged, but they had work and",25
NA,"self-esteem, reasonable quality of life, strong",25
NA,"mentoring from their elders, schooling and",25
NA,strict controls on alcohol.,25
NA,"Of course, all that ceased in the early",25
NA,1970s following the understandable granting,25
NA,"of equal wages in the pastoral industry, along",25
NA,with the misplaced provision of unfettered,25
NA,and generous welfare handouts. The related,25
NA,exodus of these people from their ancestral,25
NA,lands saw them living in settlements and on,25
NA,the fringes of towns. The highly disturbing,25
NA,result in many Aboriginal communities today,25
NA,is that we have basically poisoned recent,25
NA,generations; poisoned their bodies with alco-,25
NA,hol and other substances and poisoned their,25
NA,spirit and self-belief with handouts and wel-,25
NA,fare dependency. In many places we are see-,25
NA,ing a total breakdown in the social order.,25
NA,As I was driven around vast cattle sta-,25
NA,"tions, I witnessed cattlemen come across an",25
NA,Aboriginal elder known to them. The mutual,25
NA,respect was palpable. On the same day I saw,25
NA,the same cattleman come across young Abo-,25
NA,riginal men seriously affected by years of,25
NA,"alcohol and aimlessness, young men stripped",25
NA,of any personal dignity or self-esteem. The,25
NA,cattleman's contempt was palpable. The,25
NA,chilling fact is that the very fabric of a proud,25
NA,"and fascinating culture, many thousands of",25
NA,"years in the making, has been brought to its",25
NA,knees in less than 30 years by well-,25
NA,intentioned but seriously misguided policy.,25
NA,For me the lesson is clear. People are,26
NA,"very responsive to incentives, for good or",26
NA,"bad. The wrong incentives, no matter how",26
NA,"well meaning, can debilitate a community in",26
NA,"no time. In this case, unconditional handouts",26
NA,have provided the seeds of destruction in a,26
NA,breathtakingly short period of time. It is why,26
NA,every piece of public policy in this place is,26
NA,important. It is why every piece of public,26
NA,policy must be measured against a set of,26
NA,"principles, a set of ‘tram tracks'. It is why",26
NA,philosophy matters.,26
NA,"Clearly, restoring personal dignity and",26
NA,self-esteem is the bedrock of any solution for,26
NA,our Aboriginal community. In many places,26
NA,"this means replacing the grog, the petrol and",26
NA,"the paint with work. To this end, I commend",26
NA,the direction outlined by the Governor-,26
NA,General in his speech to the opening of the,26
NA,41st Parliament.,26
NA,During my years at the National Farmers,26
NA,Federation I was involved with two major,26
NA,industrial disputes: the Mudginberri abattoir,26
NA,dispute and the wide combs dispute. These,26
NA,two disputes proved that success is never,26
NA,"easy, regardless of the merits. Importantly,",26
NA,they also proved the underlying strength of,26
NA,the employer-employee relationship in Aus-,26
NA,tralia. Mudginberri sought to establish a right,26
NA,for employer and employee to negotiate,26
NA,terms and conditions which best met the pe-,26
NA,culiar nature of that abattoir's operation.,26
NA,wide combs dispute sought to establish the,26
NA,right of employers and employees to agree to,26
NA,"adopt new technology-in this case, a wider",26
NA,shearing comb-on a workplace by work-,26
NA,place basis.,26
NA,Nearly 20 years later it is now,26
NA,conceive that these rights were in dispute.,26
NA,"Yet Mudginberri took 27 court cases, two",26
NA,years of litigation and a $10 million farmers,26
NA,fighting fund to win. The wide combs dis-,26
NA,"pute had to contend with bullets flying,",26
NA,shearing sheds being torched and paid thugs,26
NA,"very, intimidating communities. These two dis-",26
NA,"putes were only won because, despite the",26
NA,"belligerent stance of the unions, there ex-",26
NA,"isted-and, I believe, still exists-a funda-",26
NA,mentally healthy and mature relationship,26
NA,between employer and employee in Australia,26
NA,with a mutual trust that the benefits of,26
NA,change can and will be shared.,26
NA,The disputes also highlighted that no two,26
NA,workplaces among the millions of work-,26
NA,places in Australia are the same. The more,26
NA,we do as a government to free up employers,26
NA,and their employees to settle on terms and,26
NA,conditions which maximise the unique op-,26
NA,"portunities in each workplace, the more jobs",26
NA,and the more prosperity we will see. From,26
NA,"my experience, many employers have come",26
NA,"to realise that, if they give their team the",26
NA,"right incentives, they can move mountains.",26
NA,I have also observed that this power of,26
NA,negotiating one to one has parallels in the,26
NA,international trade arena. My experience on,26
NA,the international scene includes expanding a,26
NA,commercial business into the New Zealand,26
NA,market in the late 1990s; advising major,26
NA,New Zealand companies on their move into,26
NA,Australia; facilitating large commercial pro-,26
NA,"jects in Asia, particularly in Thailand; em-",26
NA,ploying trade lobbyists in Washington in the,26
NA,1980s and negotiating with the European,26
NA,"Union, the United States and Japan on agri-",26
NA,The cultural trade matters over a decade. These,26
NA,experiences have long convinced me that the,26
NA,growing emphasis on trade agreements nego-,26
NA,tiated bilaterally between two countries is,26
NA,not only in Australia's best interests but also,26
NA,a harbinger of real progress on trade liberali-,26
NA,difficult to sation on a global basis.,26
NA,While multicountry World Trade Organi-,26
NA,sation negotiations obviously hold out the,26
NA,prospect of more comprehensive liberalisa-,26
NA,"tion, they proceed at a snail's pace, if at all,",26
NA,whereas bilateral trade agreements are deliv-,26
NA,ering major benefits in our lifetime. The,26
NA,closer economic relations agreement with,27
NA,New Zealand is a wonderful case in point.,27
NA,"Successful bilateral agreements, rather than",27
NA,stymying progress on multicountry agree-,27
NA,"ments, are in fact creating a competitive im-",27
NA,perative for non-participating countries to be,27
NA,"involved, leading the way incrementally to",27
NA,more comprehensive removal of trade barri-,27
NA,ers.,27
NA,Over the last 33 years in my roles as an,27
NA,animal health officer working in abattoirs,27
NA,and saleyards and on farms; as a tutor in,27
NA,macro-economics working with highly moti-,27
NA,"vated, mature age university students; as an",27
NA,agricultural economist and farm organisation,27
NA,and political party executive setting up and,27
NA,running an Australia-wide direct marketing,27
NA,"IT company and, in recent years, as an ad-",27
NA,viser on business strategy to global compa-,27
NA,"nies and large organisations, I have been",27
NA,regularly to all corners of Australia. Working,27
NA,with people and communities from Albany to,27
NA,Cairns and from Hobart to the North West,27
NA,Shelf has left me a committed federalist. I,27
NA,"have a great distrust of any central power, by",27
NA,"itself, understanding and effectively meeting",27
NA,the needs of far-flung communities and busi-,27
NA,nesses.,27
NA,While I see the federal government having,27
NA,"a critical leadership role to play, I agree",27
NA,strongly with the sentiment expressed by Sir,27
NA,Robert Menzies in 1960 when he said:,27
NA,... there is a deep instinct in the Australian,27
NA,"for a system of Government which, by a division",27
NA,"of legislative and administrative powers, limits",27
NA,centralisation (or “control from Canberra”) and,27
NA,protects a measure of individual freedom by not,27
NA,giving us one set of rules-even elected rulers-,27
NA,who have absolute power. In a great island conti-,27
NA,"nent with widely scattered communities, this is a",27
NA,healthy sentiment.,27
NA,No matter how much it might irk members in,27
NA,"this place from time to time-and, I suspect,",27
NA,me in the future-I believe that our great,27
NA,history of stability and resourcefulness owes,27
NA,much to the decisions about local issues be-,27
NA,ing taken locally. It owes much to the bal-,27
NA,"ance between our three tiers of government,",27
NA,including the sovereignty and authority of,27
NA,the states and the role played by local gov-,27
NA,ernment in Australia. This balance has served,27
NA,Australia well.,27
NA,The federalist imperative was further re-,27
NA,flected in the intent of our founding fathers,27
NA,"that the Senate be a states house of review, a",27
NA,chamber designed to ensure that the interests,27
NA,"of communities in each state, large and",27
NA,"small, were taken into account by the gov-",27
NA,ernment of the day. In recent decades this,27
NA,"intent has been progressively eroded, espe-",27
NA,cially with minor parties in some cases being,27
NA,far more concerned with propagating an ex-,27
NA,"treme left, international agenda than consid-",27
NA,ering the impact of national policies on local,27
NA,communities in their state. This is one key,27
NA,reason why I favour consideration being,27
NA,given by a simple act of parliament to divid-,27
NA,ing each state into six regions with two sena-,27
NA,tors selected from each region-one at each,27
NA,election.,27
NA,Drawing senators from a smaller area,27
NA,within a state and being accountable to that,27
NA,area would go some way to restoring the,27
NA,original intent of the founding fathers for a,27
NA,strong state perspective to be present in the,27
NA,federal parliament without requiring any,27
NA,change to our proven institutions. This im-,27
NA,mind perative to preserve our proven institutions,27
NA,underscored my support for an Australian,27
NA,head of state involving only minimal change,27
NA,"to our Constitution. I still see, some time in",27
NA,"the future, an Australian head of state provid-",27
NA,ing a powerful and stabilising symbol with-,27
NA,out detracting from our proud history and the,27
NA,stability of our institutions.,27
NA,My involvement with the Garvan Medical,27
NA,Research Foundation has opened my eyes to,27
NA,the recent revolution in medical and biologi-,27
NA,"cal science-a revolution which, proudly,",27
NA,Australia is in the thick of. While it is now,28
NA,"51 years since DNA was discovered, it is",28
NA,only in the last six to seven years,28
NA,tists have seriously begun to unlock this ge-,28
NA,netic code which not only controls our de-,28
NA,velopment from a fertilised egg to a complex,28
NA,human being but also determines what goes,28
NA,"wrong in disorders as diverse as cancer, men-",28
NA,tal illness and obesity.,28
NA,The innovations flowing from these dis-,28
NA,coveries in basic science are only just emerg-,28
NA,ing and will reach well beyond health and,28
NA,disease. We will see genetically modified,28
NA,micro-organisms used in the creation of en-,28
NA,"ergy products, industrial products and a host",28
NA,of other traditional areas of manufacturing.,28
NA,Biotechnology will have an unimaginable,28
NA,"impact over the next few decades, and the",28
NA,critical factor in gaining benefits for Austra-,28
NA,lia is owning the intellectual property. If we,28
NA,"do not own the technology, the profits will",28
NA,go elsewhere. It is about taking responsibility,28
NA,for our own future. To achieve this will re-,28
NA,quire Australian investors to take big risks.,28
NA,"Areas such as biotechnology, at this stage,",28
NA,involve high risks and low returns.,28
NA,My last seven years working with the top,28
NA,end of town suggest to me that our capacity,28
NA,for risk taking is fading. Our great entrepre-,28
NA,neurial spirit is residing in fewer and fewer,28
NA,people. Perhaps our self-belief is being,28
NA,"eroded. The clamour for endless reporting,",28
NA,misplaced accountability and draconian,28
NA,regulations are choking the boldness of busi-,28
NA,ness and need a serious rethink. In my view,28
NA,you cannot legislate for ethical behaviour.,28
NA,The values of a society and its institutions,28
NA,dictate acceptable ethical behaviour.,28
NA,Reducing high personal income tax rates,28
NA,must also play a big part in promoting risk,28
NA,taking. If we are to encourage individuals,28
NA,"and businesspeople to pursue opportunities,",28
NA,if we are to reignite our entrepreneurial spirit,28
NA,and if we are to discourage some of our best,28
NA,and brightest from remaining overseas be-,28
NA,"cause of uncompetitive tax rates, personal",28
NA,that scien- tax rates need to come down.,28
NA,The biotechnology revolution also has,28
NA,major implications for older Australians and,28
NA,how we cope with a rapidly ageing popula-,28
NA,"tion. Over the last 100 years in Australia, life",28
NA,expectancy has increased from 55 to 77 years,28
NA,for men and from 58 to 82 years for women.,28
NA,Yet this life expectancy stands to quickly,28
NA,reach much greater ages in the wake of the,28
NA,"genetic revolution. As such, providing a de-",28
NA,cent quality of life for our older Australians,28
NA,"presents a real challenge, especially with the",28
NA,"birthrate at its lowest point ever. In my view,",28
NA,increased taxation is not an option; it is a,28
NA,backward step.,28
NA,The best way to meet the challenge is to,28
NA,grow the economy. Getting many healthy,28
NA,Australians to keep working into their 70s in,28
NA,the years ahead is fundamental to achieving,28
NA,this objective. Many of these older Austra-,28
NA,lians would prefer to continue taking respon-,28
NA,sibility for their own lives by undertaking,28
NA,permanent part-time contract work. If they,28
NA,were able to secure up to 100 per cent of,28
NA,"their income from one employer, and still",28
NA,"achieve independent contractor status, this",28
NA,would seriously encourage continuing in-,28
NA,volvement in the work force. We should not,28
NA,underestimate the challenge. It will require a,28
NA,serious cultural shift.,28
NA,While I look forward to a rich and varied,28
NA,"political experience in the years ahead, both",28
NA,"in my electorate and in this House, I do ex-",28
NA,pect that two types of security issues will,28
NA,dominate that experience. The first is our,28
NA,national security. The world has changed,28
NA,dramatically since 9-11. Terrorists have de-,28
NA,clared war on us for ideological reasons of,28
NA,"their own, and there is no easy way out of",28
NA,"this conflict, which is not of our making.",28
NA,Appeasement is not an option. It will be a,28
NA,"long fight, and we will need our traditional",29
NA,friends.,29
NA,The second security issue is one of per-,29
NA,sonal security. My years of political observa-,29
NA,tion have led me to understand very clearly,29
NA,that what the majority of Australians aspire,29
NA,"to most is a secure life-put simply, food on",29
NA,"the table, a job, a manageable mortgage, a",29
NA,"holiday, a movie with the kids, an ability to",29
NA,"exercise some choices. To this end, maintain-",29
NA,ing a strong economy is paramount. I under-,29
NA,stand that aspiration and in this place I will,29
NA,"do what I can to deliver it. In particular, I",29
NA,will take whatever opportunities I get to,29
NA,"vey, especially to our young people, that true",29
NA,happiness and true freedom come from,29
NA,achievement-using whatever god-given,29
NA,"talents we have to chart our own course, to",29
NA,"take the consequences of our decisions, to",29
NA,"have a go. If we do this, success and security",29
NA,will follow. I thank the House for the cour-,29
NA,tesy extended to me today.,29
The SPEAKER,Order! Before I call the,29
NA,"honourable member for Cunningham, I re-",29
NA,mind honourable members that this is her,29
NA,first speech. I therefore ask that the usual,29
NA,courtesies be extended to her.,29
Ms BIRD ,Cunningham) (1.19 p.m.)-It,29
NA,is an incredible honour to be chosen by the,29
NA,people who make up the community in,29
NA,"which you live to be their representative,",29
NA,their voice in the federal parliament. So,29
NA,many good people contest elections and put,29
NA,forward their visions for the nation and yet,29
NA,so few of us are honoured with victory and,29
NA,the responsibilities that come with it. I,29
NA,like to express my appreciation of the impor-,29
NA,tant and effective role that the Hon. Stephen,29
NA,Martin played as my Labor predecessor in,29
NA,"the seat of Cunningham, both through his",29
NA,parliamentary career and through his tireless,29
NA,and enthusiastic advocacy for our region.,29
NA,At the 2002 by-election the people of,29
NA,Cunningham sent a strong message to the,29
NA,Labor Party. They returned Michael Organ as,29
NA,the member for the two years preceding this,29
NA,year's election. Michael is a person of com-,29
NA,mitment and integrity. I wish to take this op-,29
NA,portunity to wish him and his family well for,29
NA,the future.,29
NA,Each of us brings to this House our direct,29
NA,experiences of both the triumphs and the,29
NA,"troubles of the people-individuals, families",29
NA,and communities-that make up our elector-,29
NA,ates. Over the past 20 years my area has seen,29
NA,significant change that has brought many,29
NA,exciting new opportunities and shown us,29
NA,"con- new horizons. As a region, we have aggres-",29
NA,sively taken up the challenge of the industry,29
NA,restructures of the 1980s and diversified our,29
NA,economic base with great success.,29
NA,"We have a vibrant small, medium and",29
NA,home-based business community in the Illa-,29
NA,warra that employs 83 per cent of the local,29
NA,people. The people in these businesses not,29
NA,only provide employment and growth oppor-,29
NA,tunities but also are active in supporting the,29
NA,community in which they and their families,29
NA,live. At fundraising events in my electorate I,29
NA,am often impressed by the number of small,29
NA,business people actively involved in fund-,29
NA,raising for really good causes in our area. It,29
NA,is insightful to talk to them about the chal-,29
NA,lenges they face in a modern economic,29
NA,community.,29
NA,I acknowledge the work of the Illawarra,29
NA,Business Chamber and the Wollongong of-,29
NA,fice of the Australian Industry Group in re-,29
NA,searching and advocating on behalf of their,29
NA,"would memberships. Sometimes we disagree, and",29
NA,we will no doubt continue to do so on some,29
NA,"issues, but I value the positive and consulta-",29
NA,tive approach they always bring when raising,29
NA,their concerns with me. I recommit today to,29
NA,continuing my role in that constructive rela-,29
NA,tionship.,29
NA,Over the last few weeks I have been visit-,29
NA,ing many tremendous local organisations and,29
NA,companies that are involved in exciting new,30
NA,"ventures and growth in our area, including a",30
NA,local catamaran maker which exports inter-,30
NA,nationally and employs over 50 local people,30
NA,and 14 apprentices-it makes very nice,30
NA,"catamarans, I might add-and the local con-",30
NA,"servatorium of music, which is hopefully",30
NA,soon to be exporting its music education,30
NA,programs into Asia. I also visited the opening,30
NA,"only last Friday of new facilities by 313, the",30
NA,"music, entertainment and arts training or-",30
NA,ganisation. We were entertained by a recent,30
NA,"local success story, the group Porcelain,",30
NA,which has only just signed an international,30
NA,contract.,30
NA,Wollongong is officially titled ‘City of,30
NA,novation'. It is clear from these success sto-,30
NA,ries and so many others that we do more than,30
NA,pay lip-service to this title. We act on,30
NA,"tion, seek opportunities and retain confi-",30
NA,"dence in our capacity. The arts, culture and",30
NA,entertainment sector in Wollongong's econ-,30
NA,omy is also important and growing. This is,30
NA,yet another indication of the way that Wol-,30
NA,longong has responded to the major chal-,30
NA,lenges that have taken place over the last 20,30
NA,"years. This sector provides nearly 5,000 jobs",30
NA,or seven per cent of our employment. The,30
NA,development of the arts and cultural indus-,30
NA,tries in Wollongong not only provides jobs,30
NA,and opportunity to grow our economy but,30
NA,"also, crucially, acts as a focus for innovation,",30
NA,talent and creativity.,30
NA,I would also like to take this opportunity,30
NA,to acknowledge and recognise the traditional,30
NA,owners and custodians of the land on which,30
NA,we meet today and of the land encompassing,30
NA,my electorate of Cunningham. I had the op-,30
NA,portunity to meet with local Aboriginal eld-,30
NA,ers and community workers during my can-,30
NA,didacy. Against multiple barriers and too,30
NA,"often under attack, they continue to advocate",30
NA,for their people. They represent resilience in,30
NA,the face of much adversity and I recommit,30
NA,today to assisting them in my new role.,30
NA,The people of my area have built on the,30
NA,determination and resilience of our forebears,30
NA,in the mining and agriculture industries. My,30
NA,own family has worked in the Illawarra min-,30
NA,ing industry since the early 1900s. The un-,30
NA,shakeable belief in the need to support each,30
NA,other through good times and bad which was,30
NA,forged in a dangerous and difficult industry,30
NA,has left a strong legacy of communal respon-,30
NA,"sibility in me, my family and, indeed, the",30
NA,whole community in which we live. As a,30
NA,region we enriched our diversity and opti-,30
NA,mism by welcoming migration. For decades,30
NA,migrants have settled in Wollongong to work,30
NA,in the steelworks and other industries. At the,30
NA,"In- same time, they have made a considerable",30
NA,"contribution to the wonderful arts, enter-",30
NA,tainment and gastronomic diversity available,30
NA,innovato us-although the member for Watson as-,30
NA,sures me that I need to visit his electorate to,30
NA,truly appreciate that. This complements their,30
NA,important economic contribution to our re-,30
NA,gion. My parents tell of the novelty of visit-,30
NA,"ing one of the first coffee shops, located in",30
NA,"Globe Lane, Wollongong-coincidentally,",30
NA,where my office now sits-and enjoying the,30
NA,exotic experience of a glass of apple cider or,30
NA,a cup of continental coffee and a slice of,30
NA,blackforest cake. We continue to welcome,30
NA,people from around the world who settle in,30
NA,"our region, including our newest arrivals",30
NA,from the African nations in crisis today. We,30
NA,live the positive experience of tolerance and,30
NA,diversity each day.,30
NA,Our area has a very distinctive geographic,30
NA,"identity, sitting between the escarpment and",30
NA,the sea. You will have to excuse me if I,30
NA,sound like a travel brochure-I am quite at-,30
NA,tached to the area. It gives us our wonderful,30
NA,lifestyle and provides important economic,30
NA,opportunities through both tourism and our,30
NA,capacity to attract businesses by providing,30
NA,lifestyle advantages. An excellent example is,30
NA,the world-class University of Wollongong.,30
NA,Each year it attracts thousands of students,30
NA,through its excellence in research and educa-,31
NA,"tion, but marketing its high-quality programs",31
NA,is no doubt made easier when you add Wol-,31
NA,longong's unique lifestyle advantages. Talk,31
NA,to any person from the Illawarra and they,31
NA,will describe the emotional pleasure they feel,31
NA,"when, after being away from home for any",31
NA,"length of time, they reach the top of Bulli",31
NA,Pass and look down at the breathtaking pano-,31
NA,rama of the Illawarra spread out before them.,31
NA,Not only do we enjoy the beauties of our,31
NA,geography; the uniqueness of the landscape,31
NA,also gives us a very strong sense of identity,31
NA,"with our place and our community. This, I",31
NA,"believe, greatly contributes to our optimism",31
NA,and strong sense of community. Our area has,31
NA,been through many changes. We have met,31
NA,them with resilience and grown stronger. We,31
NA,"do not, however, accept that there is no",31
NA,downside to change. We know from hard,31
NA,struggle that there are always potential vic-,31
NA,tims in even the most promising of circum-,31
NA,stances. I believe that the challenge of good,31
NA,government is not only to seek out opportu-,31
NA,nities for increased prosperity but also to,31
NA,ensure that all people are able to take advan-,31
NA,tage of the new circumstances. I have been a,31
NA,member of the Australian Labor Party for 27,31
NA,"years-I do not always admit that, but I do",31
NA,today-because we are a party that takes,31
NA,seriously the need to find sound policies and,31
NA,programs that open doors for all people and,31
NA,actively seek to assist them in overcoming,31
NA,"barriers that nature, society or life circum-",31
NA,stances have placed before them.,31
NA,Over the last three years that I have been,31
NA,talking with local people as the Labor Party,31
NA,"candidate, it has become absolutely clear to",31
NA,me that there are some groups in my com-,31
NA,munity whose struggle to access a healthy,31
NA,and constructive life has become increas-,31
NA,ingly difficult. When my colleague the,31
NA,member for Lalor visited our area I asked her,31
NA,to focus the entire visit on the issue of mental,31
NA,health because several local organisations,31
NA,had been telling me about the growing num-,31
NA,ber of people needing assistance and their,31
NA,shrinking capacity to provide help. I was,31
NA,"astonished, after the visit, by the number of",31
NA,people who contacted me. Most simply,31
NA,wanted to express their appreciation that we,31
NA,had raised the profile of the issue. So many,31
NA,people had a family member or friend who,31
NA,had experienced a period of mental ill health,31
NA,and had become aware of the stigma and,31
NA,lack of services for both sufferers and their,31
NA,families and supporters. I sincerely believe,31
NA,this is a crucial public policy issue for the,31
NA,future. It will become even more urgent as,31
NA,we begin to see many more crises in our,31
NA,communities that occur when mental illness,31
NA,is not given a priority. I have given a com-,31
NA,mitment to these people and groups to con-,31
NA,tinue to advocate for them in this parliament,31
NA,and I reaffirm that commitment today.,31
NA,During the campaign I attended a forum,31
NA,on poverty in Wollongong. I had already met,31
NA,with many of the organisations that attended,31
NA,the forum over the years preceding the cam-,31
NA,paign and I found their commitment and pro-,31
NA,fessionalism an inspiration. It is true that,31
NA,economic prosperity has resulted in material,31
NA,improvements in the lifestyles of many in,31
NA,our community. It is equally true that the,31
NA,pace and demands of the new economy are,31
NA,even more likely to leave too many people,31
NA,behind. Our local St Vinnies tell me they,31
NA,have experienced a 17 per cent increase in,31
NA,the demands on their services in the last few,31
NA,years. Many groups who have traditionally,31
NA,experienced hardship and poverty as a result,31
NA,"of poor educational outcomes; poor health,",31
NA,wellbeing and safety experiences; or neglect-,31
NA,ful and abusive life circumstances are still as,31
NA,trapped in the poverty cycle as they ever,31
NA,were.,31
NA,"However, a new trend is emerging. Fami-",31
NA,lies who appear to be relatively well-off ma-,31
NA,terially are increasingly seeking assistance.,31
NA,Some of the apparently more affluent sub-,31
NA,urbs in my electorate have families register-,32
NA,ing for food hampers this Christmas for the,32
NA,first time ever. Many families are clearly,32
NA,living on optimism about their capacity to,32
NA,service their personal debt. Rising house,32
NA,prices and the large mortgages that come,32
NA,with them mean that many families are,32
NA,committing a larger and larger proportion of,32
NA,the family budget to mortgage payments.,32
NA,Their lifestyle is then often supported by the,32
NA,significant use of credit cards. It is not un-,32
NA,common for families to be balancing several,32
NA,forms of credit commitments at the same,32
NA,time. This clearly means that they are only,32
NA,one setback away from financial hardship:,32
NA,"one period of prolonged ill health, one period",32
NA,of unexpected unemployment or one major,32
NA,car repair or other unexpected expense. The,32
NA,spending optimism is often balanced on a,32
NA,fragile capacity and hides an underlying con-,32
NA,stant worry about the next bill to come in.,32
NA,It is not easy in the current environment to,32
NA,raise these issues. You cannot help feeling a,32
NA,bit like the bore at the party who is warning,32
NA,about the potential hangover the next morn-,32
NA,ing. Clearly people are enjoying their mate-,32
NA,"rial consumption, and to raise concerns about",32
NA,the potential for financial problems is a bit,32
NA,"like prodding a wound. I firmly believe,",32
NA,"however, that it would be irresponsible not to",32
NA,be talking about this issue in this parliament.,32
NA,It is irresponsible to allow this level of per-,32
NA,sonal debt and the increased potential for,32
NA,significant losses to be ignored. It is unfair,32
NA,"simply rely on our charity organisations, al-",32
NA,"ready struggling to meet current demand, to",32
NA,do even more. Addressing housing afforda-,32
NA,"bility, access to affordable health care, access",32
NA,to reliable work and reasonable working,32
NA,conditions and access to affordable child care,32
NA,are all crucial responsibilities for govern-,32
NA,"ment, but even more so given the financial",32
NA,challenges so many families face today.,32
NA,One of the issues that have caused great,32
NA,concern in our area over recent years has,32
NA,been our unacceptably high level of youth,32
NA,unemployment. I well remember the huge,32
NA,annual intakes of apprentices at the steel-,32
NA,works and the coalmines when I was a teen-,32
NA,ager in the area. Over the last 20 years these,32
NA,have almost completely disappeared. Like so,32
NA,many other areas with a significant manufac-,32
NA,"turing base, we now face the disgraceful",32
NA,situation of both high youth unemployment,32
NA,and high skills shortages.,32
NA,The Illawarra Regional Development,32
NA,Board commissioned a report in August this,32
NA,year on the size and nature of the skills,32
NA,shortage in our area. They did this in recog-,32
NA,nition of the increasing restraint this problem,32
NA,is placing on the growth of business. The,32
NA,board recognised the importance of quality,32
NA,data at a regional level to develop appropri-,32
NA,ate regional strategies for addressing prob-,32
NA,lems. I commend their foresight in recognis-,32
NA,ing that national and state focused data and,32
NA,strategies are important but are far more use-,32
NA,ful when complemented by additional re-,32
NA,gion-specific data.,32
NA,As a member representing a region in this,32
NA,"parliament, it is my intention to advocate for",32
NA,more extensive regional development pro-,32
NA,grams based on sound research and consulta-,32
NA,tion with the specific regions themselves. I,32
NA,look forward to the final report of the Illa-,32
NA,warra Regional Development Board to pro-,32
NA,vide the analysis needed to add to the anec-,32
NA,dotal evidence from businesses of the in-,32
NA,to creasing problem of the shortage of skilled,32
NA,workers.,32
NA,I must say that I found myself somewhat,32
NA,stunned in my first week in this parliament-,32
NA,and I rushed to rewrite part of my speech-,32
NA,to hear various members opposite make,32
NA,claims that my colleagues have failed to give,32
NA,due attention to the importance of technical,32
NA,education and training. As a former TAFE,32
NA,teacher and coordinator of joint schools-,32
NA,"TAFE programs and traineeship programs,",32
NA,not surprisingly I take pride in being a strong,33
NA,advocate for our excellent TAFE system and,33
NA,I have followed debate on these issues over,33
NA,the years very closely.,33
NA,My colleague the member for Throsby,33
NA,"very effectively advocated, over the three",33
NA,"years of the last parliament, a new approach",33
NA,to creating apprenticeship opportunities in,33
NA,"our area, and a very successful program is",33
NA,now running. I reject completely the claims,33
NA,by government members that Labor have,33
NA,failed to promote the importance of voca-,33
NA,"tional training. In fact, we have had to drag",33
NA,this government kicking and screaming even,33
NA,to address the fact that there is a skills,33
NA,lem in this country. Throughout my cam-,33
NA,"paign, I raised the concerns of local indi-",33
NA,"viduals and organisations, including my for-",33
NA,"mer colleagues at TAFE, about the issues of",33
NA,"youth unemployment and skills shortages,",33
NA,and today I reaffirm my commitment to con-,33
NA,tinue to advocate on these issues.,33
NA,I realistically expect to experience both,33
NA,frustration and satisfaction in working as the,33
NA,federal member for Cunningham-it is a,33
NA,combination of experiences that I am well,33
NA,familiar with-but I am also familiar with,33
NA,the importance of perseverance in the pursuit,33
NA,of good outcomes for the people I sought to,33
NA,represent and who have now placed their,33
NA,trust in me.,33
NA,I have several other concerns that I wish,33
NA,"to fight for over the coming weeks, but I",33
NA,"would like to give notice of one in particular,",33
NA,following also on some of the work done by,33
NA,my colleague the member for Throsby in,33
NA,pursuit of the allocation of a Medicare li-,33
NA,cence for the MRI machine based at Wollon-,33
NA,gong Hospital. It is well past time that the,33
NA,federal government took their responsibility,33
NA,for this matter seriously and provided the,33
NA,"licence, and that they gave public hospitals a",33
NA,bit of a priority in their allocations.,33
NA,A candidate in any election never wins,33
NA,through their own hard work alone. It is a,33
NA,"team effort, and many people have helped",33
NA,me over many years. I would like to take this,33
NA,opportunity to place on the record my appre-,33
NA,ciation for their efforts. I would like to thank,33
NA,the many dedicated branch members and,33
NA,"party supporters who letterboxed, attended",33
NA,fundraising events and staffed polling,33
NA,"booths. They took a blow in 2002, and they",33
NA,rallied around their commitment to our party,33
NA,and their belief in a better Australia under a,33
NA,federal Labor government. Their support was,33
NA,"invaluable, and I say to them today: one",33
NA,probmore rally around and we will be there.,33
NA,I would also like to thank the volunteers,33
NA,"who staffed my office-Craig, Paul, Liz,",33
NA,"Berna, Rhys, Michael, Wilf, Stan, Joan, Reg",33
NA,and Chris-and the branch campaign team of,33
NA,"Kevin, Bob, Evan, Ryan, Justin and Marc.",33
NA,Thank you also to my fellow elected repre-,33
NA,sentatives in the Illawarra: Senator Michael,33
NA,"Forshaw; member for Throsby, Jennie",33
NA,George; my state colleagues; and the many,33
NA,local government colleagues who gave me,33
NA,invaluable support during the campaign. I,33
NA,also received tremendous support from,33
NA,"EMILY's List, and I would like to thank",33
NA,Karen Mow for the many small but crucial,33
NA,tasks she undertook to help me-particularly,33
NA,remembering to take photos on election,33
NA,night.,33
NA,I am deeply appreciative of the support of,33
NA,the members and officials of the union,33
NA,movement in the Illawarra and the South,33
NA,"Coast Labour Council, in particular Richard",33
NA,"Olsen and the TWU members, Mark Arm-",33
NA,"strong and the MUA members, Mick Lane",33
NA,and members of the CFMEU building divi-,33
NA,sion and Bob Mitchell and members of the,33
NA,CFMEU mining division.,33
NA,There is one group of people spread,33
NA,across New South Wales who could not help,33
NA,directly that I wish to acknowledge. For the,33
NA,seven years prior to my election I was enor-,34
NA,mously privileged to work with a team in the,34
NA,Youth Justice Conferencing Directorate of,34
NA,the New South Wales Department of Juve-,34
NA,"nile Justice. This group of people, under the",34
NA,inspiring and supportive leadership of the,34
NA,"director, Jenny Bargen, demonstrated every",34
NA,day the true meaning of public service. We,34
NA,were privileged to work with a truly innova-,34
NA,tive and successful piece of legislation introyounger,34
NA,"duced by the Carr government, which estab-",34
NA,lished restorative justice practices for juve-,34
NA,nile offenders-a true success story. The,34
NA,team I worked with truly believed in their,34
NA,purpose and seriously applied themselves to,34
NA,delivering a high-quality program. I really,34
NA,valued working with them and I appreciate,34
NA,their efforts in supporting me.,34
NA,I say to the Leader of the Opposition and,34
NA,the shadow ministers who visited the elec-,34
NA,"torate: thank you for your support, advice",34
NA,and encouragement. Thank you also to the,34
NA,tireless Alison who helped organise so many,34
NA,of these visits.,34
NA,I bring to my new role a strength that has,34
NA,sustained me throughout my life-the won-,34
NA,derful support and unending faith of my fam-,34
NA,ily. I am proud of the values they have in-,34
NA,stilled in me and the example they constantly,34
NA,provide to me. I thank my maternal grand-,34
NA,"parents, Jimmy and Mavis Kerr, who taught",34
NA,me the value of strong beliefs and strong,34
NA,"family, and my paternal grandmother, Annie",34
NA,"Reed, who always had time to listen and",34
NA,made me feel I was special.,34
NA,"I thank my aunts, uncles and cousins, who",34
NA,always rally around to support me: my Aunt,34
NA,"Cath, whom we sorely miss, and Uncle",34
NA,Kevin; Jim and Vanessa; Lorraine and John;,34
NA,Arthur and Lynn; Bob and Jane; Norm-also,34
NA,missed-and Jan; and Jack and Jeanette. I,34
NA,"have 17 cousins, whom I will not name, but I",34
NA,very much value their numbers as well as,34
NA,their support and friendship.,34
NA,"To my former husband, Barry, and his",34
NA,"family, Merv and Ruby, Russ and Cheryl,",34
NA,"Barb and Tom, I say thank you for the years",34
NA,of support and encouragement that you gave,34
NA,me in so many ways. My great appreciation,34
NA,and thanks go to Gino for his faith in me and,34
NA,his invaluable encouragement and support.,34
NA,I often jokingly comment that one of the,34
NA,reasons I am a survivor is that I have four,34
NA,brothers. The truth is they enrich me,34
NA,as a person each and every day. I thank Kev,34
NA,and Sharon and the kids; Rod and Dana and,34
NA,the girls; and Anthony and Maria and our,34
NA,"newest little member Nicholas, who staffed",34
NA,his first polling booth and attended his first,34
NA,fundraiser at the age of three months. I also,34
NA,"thank my other brother, Brett. You have all",34
NA,been through very difficult times with me on,34
NA,my journey here and your companionship,34
NA,has been a great strength to me. I am so,34
NA,pleased you can all be with me today.,34
NA,I hardly know where to find words for the,34
NA,next two people I want to thank. It seems,34
NA,impossible to begin to describe what they,34
NA,"have done for me, but I know they know",34
NA,how much I value what I cannot even begin,34
NA,"to put into words. To my mum and dad, Bev",34
NA,"and Kev Reed, I simply say thank you and I",34
NA,will not let you down.,34
NA,"Finally, I wish to thank the two most im-",34
NA,"portant people in my life, my sons, Michael",34
NA,and Chris. I know that sometimes you,34
NA,probably thought Mum was a bit mad to per-,34
NA,"severe with her dream, but I never doubted",34
NA,your love and support. You both make me,34
NA,very proud as I look at the wonderful young,34
NA,"men you have grown into, and I am so glad",34
NA,to have you both here today.,34
Mr CADMAN ,Mitchell) (1.41 p.m.)-,34
NA,"Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your ap-",34
NA,pointment as Speaker and your exhibition of,34
NA,generosity in the last few minutes. The ad-,34
NA,dress-in-reply debate gives us an opportunity,34
NA,to look at the past three years and the chal-,34
NA,"lenges of the future, of the next three years.",35
NA,It is a pivotal point where the government,35
NA,"sets out its plans for the coming period,",35
NA,based on the result of the election. A critical,35
NA,factor of the past three years has surely been,35
NA,the growth of Australia. Growth is needed to,35
NA,"supply employment, and a growth of three to",35
NA,four per cent is critical for there to be a,35
NA,growth in jobs. The current government has,35
NA,achieved that growth. There has been a,35
NA,"growth in jobs, and there has been an in-",35
NA,crease in the capacity of business and fami-,35
NA,lies.,35
NA,The most important factor in achieving,35
NA,growth is to establish confidence. Confi-,35
NA,dence in business and families is the key,35
NA,tor in a successful economy and a successful,35
NA,nation. There has been confidence in Austra-,35
NA,lia. Confidence has been built up over a pe-,35
NA,riod of time. One of the most significant fac-,35
NA,tors in achieving that confidence has been a,35
NA,plan to pay off the debt that we were left,35
NA,with by the previous Labor government. That,35
NA,was a confidence-building factor for most,35
NA,people. They knew we were in debt and they,35
NA,wanted a process whereby we could restore a,35
NA,proper balance. There was $9 or $10 billion,35
NA,going out every year just to cover the debt.,35
NA,was a huge drain on Australian taxpayers.,35
NA,They understood that a plan to deal with the,35
NA,debt was significant. A plan to reduce taxa-,35
NA,"tion, to give people more of their own",35
NA,"money, was a significant confidence builder",35
NA,"as well. We had a plan to be competitive, to",35
NA,"be able to establish our place in the world,",35
NA,trade with the best and to hold our own. The,35
NA,community has seen that and has welcomed,35
NA,the opportunity to expand into world markets,35
NA,and to expand into local markets and replace,35
NA,imports.,35
NA,Reward for effort is a significant part of,35
NA,"confidence building and, therefore, a signifi-",35
NA,cant part of growth and a successful econ-,35
NA,omy. An increase in productivity has been,35
NA,brought about by people being more content,35
NA,in the workplace. There have been fewer,35
NA,"strikes, fewer stoppages, real increases in",35
NA,"reward, better returns for effort, better re-",35
NA,turns for families and better outcomes for a,35
NA,week's work. These have also been part of a,35
NA,confidence-building process that we have,35
NA,experienced and which indeed has been part,35
NA,of the reason for the growth in the econ-,35
NA,"omy-more jobs, falling unemployment, real",35
NA,"wage increases, a low cost-of-living increase",35
NA,and low interest rates. All these factors to-,35
NA,"gether have produced a boost in confidence,",35
NA,"a capacity for growth, increased wealth, in-",35
NA,creased income and increased prosperity.,35
NA,Now is an opportunity for us to assess some,35
NA,fac- of the problems that have been overcome:,35
NA,"the Asian economic crisis, world terrorism",35
NA,and the declining rainfall that has affected so,35
NA,many Australian industries.,35
The DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr,35

NA,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,35
NA,"Lehner, Mr Mal",35
Ms CORCORAN ,Isaacs) (1.45 p.m.)-,35
NA,So often local people who put so much into,35
NA,to their community do not receive recognition,35
NA,unless they are in the media spotlight. How-,35
NA,"ever, once in a while somebody truly dedi-",35
NA,cated and excellent is recognised and given,35
NA,the kudos they deserve. Earlier this year I,35
NA,had the pleasure of recognising the achieve-,35
NA,ments of one such person-Mal Lehner. Mal,35
NA,has put years of work and commitment into,35
NA,"his local football club, the Seaford Junior",35
NA,Football Club.,35
NA,"On Father's Day this year, I was invited",36
NA,by the club to their annual presentation day,36
NA,to award Mal with his Commonwealth,36
NA,Sports Award. Mal was nominated for the,36
NA,"award by his colleagues, who were im-",36
NA,pressed by Mal's dedication to the club and,36
NA,his work with the junior players. His work,36
NA,has fostered talent and given confidence to,36
NA,those who needed a little extra help. Not only,36
NA,did Mal play as a junior for the club for five,36
NA,years; he then returned as a trainer. His,36
NA,"nephew was there playing for the club, con-",36
NA,tinuing the family tradition.,36
NA,In 1996 Mal began coaching the team he,36
NA,once played in as a youngster. He stepped,36
NA,aside in 2003 because the club could only,36
NA,"field one team, but he has returned this year",36
NA,to coach the under-nines-the most inexperi-,36
NA,enced players in the club. Mal has a very,36
NA,encouraging coaching style. It is based on,36
NA,giving positive feedback and facilitating an,36
NA,inclusive atmosphere amongst the players.,36
NA,Last year Mal was rewarded with a life,36
NA,membership of the Seaford Junior Football,36
NA,Club in recognition of his 16 years service in,36
NA,different capacities in the club. (Time ex-,36

Mrs DRAPER ,Makin) (1.46 p.m.)- Mr,36
NA,"Speaker, I congratulate you on your election",36
NA,to such high office. I rise to speak today in,36
NA,support of the aims of a group of parents and,36
NA,community leaders who have formed Dignity,36
NA,for the Disabled to lobby the government of,36
NA,South Australia for more support for intellec-,36
NA,"tually disabled people. For too long, the",36
NA,Rann Labor government has ignored the,36
NA,plight of the disabled and their families. That,36
NA,is why these community based groups have,36
NA,taken the unprecedented step of organising a,36
NA,very public campaign to demand that their,36
NA,needs be heard on North Terrace.,36
NA,Group leader David Holst and other par-,36
NA,"ents have raised in the vicinity of $100,000",36
NA,"for their campaign, which demonstrates the",36
NA,"seriousness and urgency of the situation, par-",36
NA,ticularly for the Moving On program. The,36
NA,program was designed as a day-stay program,36
NA,which provides social interaction and self-,36
NA,development for school leavers. It used to be,36
NA,"five days a week, but this had been cut back",36
NA,to three and even fewer due to underfunding,36
NA,by the state government. While Minister Jay,36
NA,"Weatherill has made an announcement,",36
NA,"probably only because of adverse publicity,",36
NA,"to now fund it five days a week, this per-",36
NA,formance is not good enough.,36
NA,Most people would find it difficult to,36
NA,imagine how stressful daily life is for the,36
NA,parents of children who require around-the-,36
NA,"clock care, and, to make it even harder, these",36
NA,are not small children but grown adults. The,36
NA,level of stress is magnified by the fact that,36
NA,this supervision is needed seven days a week,36
NA,for anything up to 30 or 40 years. According,36
NA,"to David Holst, there are 330 people on the",36
NA,waiting list for urgent intellectual disability,36
NA,services council residential care. Premier,36
NA,Rann and his government must take immedi-,36
NA,ate action to remedy this situation. (Time,36

NA,"Cox, Captain Rodney",36
Ms BURKE ,Chisholm) (1.48 p.m.)- Mr,36
NA,"Speaker, congratulations on your elevation to",36
NA,this role. I rise today to say congratulations,36
NA,also to the Victorian nominee for the Austra-,36
NA,"lian of the Year-Captain Rodney Cox, who",36
NA,is an extraordinary human being. In his 28,36
NA,"years of life, he has managed to put in an",36
NA,"enormous amount. Sadly, Rodney is no",36
NA,longer a constituent of mine-since the re-,36
NA,cent redistribution of electorates-but I got,36
NA,to know Rodney very well when he was the,36
NA,resident captain of the reservist Army bar-,36
NA,racks in Huntingdale. Rodney then went to,36
NA,"serve in Timor with INTERFET, and he was",36
NA,unfortunately involved in the Bali bombing.,36
NA,For this event Rodney has been recognised,37
NA,by the Army.,37
NA,He then decided that he needed a quieter,37
NA,life. He managed to do six weeks of his arti-,37
NA,"cles and then took a posting with the UN,",37
NA,"where, yes, you guessed it, he was blown up",37
NA,in Iraq. He has been nominated for a bravery,37
NA,"award, and I hope he is recognised for that",37
NA,"service. Rodney has left Iraq, but he is now",37
NA,"serving in Kabul in Afghanistan, in the area",37
NA,"of security. It is a very risky pursuit, but he is",37
NA,doing it with absolute fervour and his normal,37
NA,dedication. Rodney is an exceptional person.,37
NA,I fervently hope that he will be made the,37
NA,"Australian of the Year, because he sums up",37
NA,what we need to hold near and dear in our,37
NA,"lives at the moment-mateship, commitment",37
NA,to your country. I congratulate him on his,37
NA,Victorian nomination and hope that we will,37
NA,get to congratulate him on Australia Day.,37
NA,Ryan Electorate: Recognition Awards,37
Mr JOHNSON ,Ryan) (1.50 p.m.)-Last,37
NA,"Friday, 26 November, I had the wonderful",37
NA,opportunity of hosting the 2004 Ryan Rec-,37
NA,ognition Awards. It is the third occasion that,37
NA,I have had the opportunity of doing this. We,37
NA,held it at Nudgee Junior College in In-,37
NA,"dooroopilly, in the Ryan electorate. We had",37
NA,an enormous number of residents from the,37
NA,community-in excess of 350-come along.,37
NA,It was a wonderful gathering of young peo-,37
NA,"ple, businesspeople, community leaders and",37
NA,those many residents of Ryan who have,37
NA,made service to the community their No. 1,37
NA,priority.,37
NA,"When I first initiated these awards, we had",37
NA,only some 25 to 30 recipients. On this occa-,37
NA,sion the recipients are too many to name and,37
NA,too many to be able to speak of all their con-,37
NA,tributions to the Ryan community. But I want,37
NA,to pay tribute in the parliament today to,37
NA,"those people who, from across the spectrum",37
NA,"of business, schools and community organi-",37
NA,"sations such as Rotary and Lions, have really",37
NA,"led the way, showing how Australians give",37
NA,their time very generously to their fellow,37
NA,Australians. I want to mention very quickly,37
NA,the three categories that we had. We had the,37
NA,"Ryan youth recognition awards, the Ryan",37
NA,Recognition Awards and a special category,37
NA,for young people from school who will,37
NA,clearly show the way in the future. (Time,37

NA,Federal Election: Visually Impaired and,37
NA,Blind Voters,37
Mr MURPHY ,Lowe) (1.51 p.m.)-,37
NA,Amongst the questions I placed on the first,37
NA,Notice Paper of this parliament is question,37
NA,"No. 40, addressed on 17 November 2004 to",37
NA,the Minister representing the Special Minis-,37
NA,ter of State. My question asks what the min-,37
NA,ister is doing to ensure that visually impaired,37
NA,and blind people are able to independently,37
NA,cast a vote at the next federal election.,37
NA,The Royal Blind Society of New South,37
NA,Wales and the Association of Blind Citizens,37
NA,of New South Wales are located in Enfield,37
NA,and Burwood respectively. I am very proud,37
NA,to report to the House that these wonderful,37
NA,institutions that do so much to help the visu-,37
NA,ally impaired are both situated in my elector-,37
NA,ate of Lowe. In this modern and very techno-,37
NA,"logical age, there is no reason why people",37
NA,who are visually impaired cannot be afforded,37
NA,the right to cast a vote in secret. This is their,37
NA,"democratic right. Accordingly, I call on the",37
NA,government and the Joint Standing Commit-,37
NA,tee on Electoral Matters to immediately in-,37
NA,vestigate this matter and provide the tech-,37
NA,nology and a system that will allow visually,37
NA,impaired people to vote independently at the,37
NA,"next federal election, which is expected in",37
NA,2007. I urge all members of this House to,37
NA,support this initiative.,37
NA,Macquarie Electorate: Rural Fire Service,37
NA,and State Emergency Service,37
Mr BARTLETT ,Macquarie) (1.53,37
NA,p.m.)-Last Saturday I attended a presenta-,37
NA,tion ceremony for members of the local bri-,38
NA,"gades of the Rural Fire Service, to present",38
NA,the national medal and long service awards.,38
NA,This was the third such ceremony in the last,38
NA,two months. Also in that time I attended a,38
NA,similar ceremony for the State Emergency,38
NA,Service members in the Blue Mountains. All,38
NA,these ceremonies recognised the outstanding,38
NA,efforts of close to 100 men and women in the,38
NA,local brigades and SES. These awards range,38
NA,from 15 years to 50 years of service to the,38
NA,local community-voluntary service total-,38
NA,"ling many hundreds of years, with hundreds",38
NA,of hours for each of those years; service at,38
NA,great personal cost and cost to their own,38
NA,"families; and service on the front line, which,",38
NA,in the face of blazing infernos and other dan-,38
NA,"gers, involves serious risks to their own",38
NA,lives.,38
NA,Most communities have their army of,38
NA,emergency service and firefighting volun-,38
NA,"teers, yet the nature of the Blue Mountains",38
NA,makes us particularly prone to the fury of,38
NA,nature. The incredible efforts of the men and,38
NA,women of organisations such as the RFS and,38
NA,"the SES, not to mention others such as the",38
NA,"ambulance service and the Red Cross, pro-",38
NA,vide much-needed and greatly appreciated,38
NA,protection for our local community. We,38
NA,thank them for their outstanding effort and,38
NA,congratulate them for these thoroughly de-,38
NA,served awards.,38
NA,Artists: Remuneration,38
Ms PLIBERSEK ,Sydney) (1.54 p.m.)-,38
NA,I rise today because I have been presented,38
NA,"with a petition from 1,622 local artists call-",38
NA,ing for the fair treatment of artists. It is,38
NA,to say that the contribution of artists is often,38
NA,overlooked in the Australian community. As,38
NA,for so many people who undertake work that,38
NA,"they truly love, often the remuneration is",38
NA,simply not there; they are expected to work,38
NA,"for love. These 1,622 artists ask that-",38
NA,instead of being expected to fulfil the cliche,38
NA,of the starving artist-consistent with the,38
NA,"recommendations of the Myer report, they",38
NA,are properly remunerated for some of the,38
NA,work they do.,38
NA,When the coalition government was first,38
NA,"elected in 1996, a mandatory fee that was",38
NA,usually paid to artists who were exhibiting in,38
NA,publicly funded galleries was withdrawn.,38
NA,That has made an enormous difference to the,38
NA,income of the average artist. The artists who,38
NA,signed the petition want to see that fee rein-,38
NA,"stated, consistent with the recommendations",38
NA,of the Myer report. It is worth remembering,38
NA,that the median income for artists in 2000-01,38
NA,"was about $18,500. That of course includes",38
NA,some-very few-very highly paid artists.,38
NA,This is just above the poverty line. We need,38
NA,to work together to ensure that artists no,38
NA,longer fulfil the cliche of the starving artist.,38
NA,Corangamite Electorate: Otway National,38
NA,Park,38
Mr MCARTHUR ,Corangamite) (1.55,38
NA,"p.m.)-In the Otways, in the heartland of",38
NA,"Corangamite, the Victorian government is set",38
NA,"to create a 100,000-hectare national park.",38
NA,"The Minister for Environment, John",38
NA,"Thwaites, announced this yesterday. It will",38
NA,be a nine times increase. I put on the public,38
NA,record concern about what resources will be,38
NA,devoted to this national park. Will the roads,38
NA,that were provided by the timber industry in,38
NA,the previous 40 years be maintained? Will,38
NA,the national park be able to fight another Ash,38
NA,Wednesday? Will the resources of the Victo-,38
NA,rian government be allocated to maintain the,38
NA,"park, to make sure that weeds such as black-",38
NA,"fair berries do not get out of control, that feral",38
NA,animals are kept under control and that ac-,38
NA,cess will be available for the residents of,38
NA,Corangamite? And will the state government,38
NA,be accountable in the way in which they,38
NA,maintain the park and put on the public re-,38
NA,cord the value that the park now has and the,38
NA,value the park might have in another 10,39
NA,years? This is a very critical issue.,39
NA,The Bracks government threw out the,39
NA,RFA in the Otways and are to remove log-,39
NA,"ging by the year 2008, and they have now",39
NA,created this massive national park. But they,39
NA,have given no undertaking or guarantee that,39
NA,they will maintain the Otway National Park,39
NA,in its present state and that they,39
NA,"the future, and they have given no guarantee",39
NA,of the amount of money they will put in the,39
NA,"budget. Also, will the fuel reduction burning",39
NA,that should be undertaken to maintain the,39
NA,biodiversity in that park be undertaken on an,39
NA,annual basis to ensure that the quality of the,39
NA,park remains? (Time expired),39
NA,Canberra Electorate: Burns Club Pipe,39
Ms ANNETTE ELLIS ,Canberra) (1.57,39
NA,"p.m.)-My congratulations to you, Mr",39
NA,"Speaker, on your election to your office. In",39
NA,"my electorate I have a Burns Club-in fact,",39
NA,one of the largest in the world. They very,39
NA,proudly sponsor a Burns Club Pipe Band. It,39
NA,"is my pleasure to tell this House that, over",39
NA,"the last two years, the members of that band",39
NA,did some fairly serious fundraising and man-,39
NA,aged to get enough money together to send a,39
NA,group of nearly 200 people to Scotland a,39
NA,couple of months ago for the world champi-,39
NA,onship pipe band competition. They sent a,39
NA,second grade and fourth grade band across.,39
NA,"The second grade band, amongst other",39
NA,"things, won a fourth place. The fourth grade",39
NA,band won a first place. They had an ex-,39
NA,"tremely successful tour of Scotland, around",39
NA,"Glasgow, Perth and Crieff, just north of",39
NA,"Perth, and came back not only having",39
NA,achieved a great deal of success but also hav-,39
NA,ing represented my community extremely,39
NA,well.,39
NA,"Of course, the thing that makes it even",39
NA,"better for me is that this band, under Pipe",39
NA,"Major Athol Chalmers, actually runs a col-",39
NA,lege to ensure that young pipers and young,39
NA,drummers are encouraged to take up their,39
NA,musical talent with pipe band music. With,39
NA,that group of 200 were included several very,39
NA,young students who are now budding pipers,39
NA,and drummers of the future. I would like to,39
NA,endorse to the House the very great success,39
NA,of the Burns Club Pipe Band at that competi-,39
NA,will do so in tion. (Time expired),39
NA,Tofa Mamao a Samoa Park,39
Mr RIPOLL ,Oxley) (1.59 p.m.)-On,39
NA,"Saturday, 30 October, I had the pleasure of",39
NA,attending the official opening of a commu-,39
NA,nity park in the Ipswich suburb of Redbank.,39
NA,"This park, the Tofa Mamao a Samoa Park, is",39
NA,not your average garden variety council park.,39
NA,It is dedicated to the local Samoan commu-,39
NA,"Band nity, although I might add it is certainly able",39
NA,to be enjoyed by all members of the local,39
NA,community and belongs to all the people of,39
NA,Ipswich. ‘Tofa mamao' translates roughly,39
NA,"into ‘thinking future', which is an apt de-",39
NA,scription of what those who were involved in,39
NA,the establishment of this park were doing-,39
NA,thinking about the future and creating a place,39
NA,where their local people will be able to enjoy,39
NA,"many hours of play, community and togeth-",39
NA,erness.,39
NA,"To the best of my knowledge, this is the",39
NA,first council park in Australia to be named in,39
NA,honour of a local Samoan community. In the,39
NA,electorate of Oxley and in and around Ips-,39
NA,wich and the south-western Brisbane area the,39
NA,"Samoan community has nearly 3,000 mem-",39
NA,"bers. Over the years, this park has become",39
NA,something of a focal point for the local,39
NA,"community and it has attracted up to 10,000",39
NA,people to specific events. I want to congratu-,39
NA,late the Samoan community for the great,39
NA,work they have done and for having this park,39
NA,named after them.,39

The SPEAKER ,2.00 p.m.)-I inform the,40
NA,"House of the death on Saturday, 20 Novem-",40
NA,"ber 2004 of Janine Haines AM, a former",40
NA,senator. Janine Haines represented the state,40
NA,of South Australia from 1977 to 1978 and,40
NA,"1981 to 1990, and was a former Leader of",40
NA,the Australian Democrats.,40
Mr ANDERSON ,Gwydir-Acting,40
NA,"Prime Minister) (2.00 p.m.)-On indulgence,",40
NA,I would like to say a few words about the,40
NA,"passing on 20 November of Janine Haines, a",40
NA,former leader of the Australian Democrats.,40
NA,Janine Haines was born on 8 May 1945 in,40
NA,"South Australia to Francis Carter, a police-",40
NA,"man, and his wife, Beryl, a schoolteacher.",40
NA,She was educated at Brighton High School,40
NA,"and Adelaide University, where she received",40
NA,"a Bachelor of Arts, and the Adelaide Teach-",40
NA,"ers College, where she received a diploma of",40
NA,teaching. She went on to become a teacher of,40
NA,English and maths in high schools before,40
NA,entering politics.,40
NA,"In 1975, Janine Haines stood for the Sen-",40
NA,ate on the Liberal Movement Party ticket.,40
NA,"She was not elected at that time, but was",40
NA,later chosen by the then Premier of South,40
NA,"Australia, Don Dunstan, to fill a casual va-",40
NA,cancy in the Senate following the retirement,40
NA,of Steele Hall in 1977. Janine Haines became,40
NA,the first senator and also the first female,40
NA,senator for the Australian Democrats. Her,40
NA,first term as a senator expired on 30 June,40
NA,1978. She was elected to the Senate again in,40
NA,"1980, taking up the position on 1 July 1981.",40
NA,She was re-elected in 1983 and 1987. She,40
NA,was appointed leader of the Australian De-,40
NA,mocrats in March 1986 on the retirement of,40
NA,"Don Chipp, becoming the first woman to",40
NA,lead a political party in Australia. She held,40
NA,"that position until March 1990, when she",40
NA,resigned from the Senate to contest the,40
NA,House of Representatives seat of Kingston,40
NA,"and was defeated by the incumbent member,",40
NA,"Gordon Bilney, from the Labor Party.",40
NA,Throughout her time in parliament Mrs,40
NA,Haines was always an advocate for gender,40
NA,"equity and women's issues, but she also",40
NA,maintained a strong interest in a wide range,40
NA,of issues affecting the Australian community.,40
NA,In her first speech to the parliament she said,40
NA,that it was not her intention to restrict herself,40
NA,to so-called women's issues or to put only,40
NA,the women's point of view but that she in-,40
NA,tended to concern herself with as many is-,40
NA,sues as possible affecting the people of Aus-,40
NA,tralia and in particular her home state of,40
NA,South Australia. She was the Australian De-,40
NA,mocrats' spokeswoman for what she called,40
NA,"the social justice portfolios-health, social",40
NA,"security, housing and construction, commu-",40
NA,nity services and women's affairs-as well,40
NA,"as finance, Attorney-General's, Special Min-",40
NA,ister of State and Prime Minister and Cabinet,40
NA,portfolio issues.,40
NA,During her time as a senator and party,40
NA,leader she was a key figure in the Senate's,40
NA,consideration of quite a wide range of legis-,40
NA,lation. Among her political achievements she,40

NA,Australian Labor Party joins with the Acting,41
NA,Prime Minister in expressing our condo-,41
NA,lences and sympathy on the passing of Janine,41
NA,Haines. She was well liked and respected,41
NA,"around this building and, of course, well",41
NA,membered as leading the Australian Democ-,41
NA,rats when they were at their peak. She can,41
NA,take great credit for that achievement.,41
NA,She saw them as much more than a Senate,41
NA,party-she saw the true legitimacy of Aus-,41
NA,"tralian politics as resting in this place,",41
NA,"House of Representatives, and so at the 1990",41
NA,election she decided to give up her place in,41
NA,the Senate to contest the seat of Kingston in,41
NA,this place. She won more than 26 per cent of,41
NA,the primary vote but failed to attract the,41
NA,preferences that were needed to take the,41
NA,That was a real landmark in the development,41
NA,of the Democrats and an achievement in its,41
NA,"own right. For that party, it had the spin-off",41
NA,"benefit of lifting their profile. In fact, at that",41
NA,"election, in the Senate they lifted their sup-",41
NA,port to 12.6 per cent of the vote nationwide,41
NA,and so her party easily held the balance of,41
NA,power in the other place. So while she was,41
NA,unsuccessful in trying to be the first Democ-,41
NA,"rat elected to the House of Representatives,",41
NA,she gave them their high-water mark in the,41
NA,Senate.,41
NA,She was a very effective politician. She,41
NA,was the first woman to lead an Australian,41
NA,political party and in that role was an inspira-,41
NA,tion to a huge number of Australians. She,41
NA,was a strong and committed leader of her,41
NA,party and saw its role as much more than an,41
NA,upper house political organisation. In the,41
NA,"1990s, after that defeat, she continued to",41
NA,make an important contribution to the Aus-,41
NA,tralian community through her writing and,41
NA,"her public speaking. In fact, she had just be-",41
NA,gun a new career as the Deputy Vice-,41
NA,"Chancellor of the University of Adelaide, her",41
NA,"home town, when she was struck by illness.",41

NA,sure it is shared right around the House-I,41

Mr COSTELLO ,Higgins-Treasurer),41
NA,"(2.06 p.m.)-On indulgence, on behalf of the",41
NA,"Liberal Party, I too wish to pass on our con-",41
NA,the dolences to the family of Janine Haines: to,41
NA,"her husband, Ian, to her daughters, Bronwyn",41
NA,"and Melanie, and to other family members,",41
NA,on what will be a very great loss for them.,41
NA,Janine Haines filled a casual Senate vacancy,41
NA,in 1977 at the age of 32. It was a very young,41
NA,seat. age to begin a parliamentary career. She,41
NA,came into the Senate to fill the vacancy,41
NA,"caused by Steele Hall, who had been elected",41
NA,on the votes of the Liberal Movement Party.,41
NA,Steele had been a premier of the Liberal and,42
NA,Country League in South Australia and had,42
NA,disagreed with the Liberal and Country,42
NA,League and formed the Liberal Movement,42
NA,"Party. He had been elected to the Senate and,",42
NA,"when he vacated the Senate seat, Janine",42
NA,Haines filled it. Steele was to bring the Lib-,42
NA,eral Movement Party back into the Liberal,42
NA,and Country League and turn it into the Lib-,42
NA,eral Party of Australia in South Australia.,42
NA,Janine went on to the other third party force,42
NA,"which was then gathering in Australia, the",42
NA,Australian Democrats-which had also been,42
NA,formed by a former senior member of the,42
NA,"Liberal Party, Don Chipp.",42
NA,Janine Haines's view was that if the De-,42
NA,mocrats were to become the significant third,42
NA,party force in Australian politics they had to,42
NA,win lower house seats. She had the courage,42
NA,of her convictions to run for a lower house,42
NA,"seat in 1990, when she did exceptionally",42
NA,well but did not win. The seat that she ran,42
NA,"for, Kingston, has been very much a mar-",42
NA,"ginal seat, slipping between the various po-",42
NA,"litical parties, ever since 1990. Janine",42
NA,Haines's position in the Senate was taken by,42
NA,"Senator Meg Lees, who in turn was also to",42
NA,go on to lead the Australian Democrats.,42
NA,Senator Haines began what has proven to,42
NA,be quite a tradition in the Australian Democ-,42
NA,rats. She was the first woman to lead a po-,42
NA,"litical party, and she did it with great panache",42
NA,and great aplomb. There is no doubt that in,42
NA,her day she was a very significant political,42
NA,player. She attracted a lot of adherence to the,42
NA,"Australian Democrats, and she was a very",42
NA,forceful spokeswoman for the Australian,42
NA,Democrats. There is no doubt that she had a,42
NA,"keen intellect, a very good political feel and",42
NA,a great deal of charisma as she led that po-,42
NA,litical party.,42
NA,Janine Haines went through some per-,42
NA,sonal difficulties. She came close to death in,42
NA,"a car accident once, out at Whyalla, but she",42
NA,never let those difficulties deter her. She,42
NA,talked about a ravenous hunger for politics,42
NA,"and said, ‘Once you've tried it, you get",42
NA,hooked.' That may well be the experience of,42
NA,many members in the House. It is a great,42
NA,"tragedy for her and her family, to whom I",42
NA,pass on the condolences of the Liberal Party.,42
NA,It is a loss to the people of South Australia,42
NA,and those people who supported her in third,42
NA,party politics during her career. On behalf of,42
NA,"the Liberal Party, I pass on condolences to",42
NA,her friends and supporters.,42
Ms MACKLIN ,Jagajaga) (2.10 p.m.)-,42
NA,"On indulgence, I am very pleased to join the",42
NA,previous speakers to offer my condolences to,42
NA,Janine's family. Hers was an extraordinary,42
NA,life cut far too short. Janine Haines became,42
NA,the first woman to lead a federal parliamen-,42
NA,"tary party, in 1986. I have to say I am very",42
NA,sorry that I did not know her. Those who did,42
NA,know her often described Janine Haines as,42
NA,having a very direct and no-nonsense style-,42
NA,one of the great characteristics that I think,42
NA,many people will remember her for. She cer-,42
NA,tainly demonstrated that in some of her early,42
NA,speeches in the parliament where she called,42
NA,for urgent action to address the plight of In-,42
NA,digenous Australians. She also called for,42
NA,greater recognition of and participation by,42
NA,women in public life.,42
NA,"Given her prior career as a teacher, she",42
NA,pursued with great passion the issue of ac-,42
NA,"cess to education. As she said herself, the",42
NA,right of children to the best education system,42
NA,possible was something that she pursued,42
NA,right throughout her parliamentary career.,42
NA,She called for the government of the day to,42
NA,stop providing placebos and start administer-,42
NA,ing restorative medicine in the form of action,42
NA,"not words, teachers not tape recorders and",42
NA,relationships not rock gardens. She had a,42
NA,great passion for education that of course,42
NA,came from her time as a teacher. In an un-,42
NA,"usual combination for a teacher, she was a",42
NA,teacher of both maths and English. She stud-,42
NA,ied the Australian poet John Shaw Nielsen,43
NA,while she was teaching part time. She was a,43
NA,woman of extraordinary talents and interests.,43
NA,"As others have said already today, there",43
NA,no question that she was a popular and very,43
NA,widely respected leader of the Australian,43
NA,"Democrats. I think that, as others have said",43
NA,"today, those years could be looked upon as",43
NA,"the party's golden years, and that owes so",43
NA,much to her extraordinary leadership. To her,43
NA,"husband of 37 years, Ian, her daughters,",43
NA,"Melanie and Bronwyn, and their families, the",43
NA,"grandchildren, we offer our sincere condo-",43
NA,lences.,43
Mr DOWNER ,Mayo-Minister for For-,43
NA,"eign Affairs) (2.12 p.m.)-On indulgence, I",43
NA,would very briefly like to support the com-,43
NA,ments that have been made and say how very,43
NA,sorry I was to hear of Janine Haines's death.,43
NA,I think Janine Haines was the most substan-,43
NA,tial leader that the Australian Democrats,43
NA,"had, and I really mean that. As others have",43
NA,"said, she was a very articulate woman and a",43
NA,very intelligent woman. She was also a very,43
NA,honourable and honest woman. Whilst I did,43
NA,"not agree with her on many issues, I really",43
NA,"did admire her fortitude, her courage and her",43
NA,"integrity. She was, as I said, the most sub-",43
NA,stantial leader that the Australian Democrats,43
NA,have had. She was substantial not just in,43
NA,terms of her high profile but in terms of the,43
NA,substance of the person.,43
NA,"I had a little to do with her, as she came",43
NA,from my own state of South Australia. In,43
NA,particular I think today is the day to confess,43
NA,that in 1990 we were very concerned about,43
NA,her determination to win the seat of King-,43
NA,ston. Janine Haines was very popular at that,43
NA,time. The Democrats were riding very high,43
NA,"in 1990, and she put a substantial effort into",43
NA,winning the seat of Kingston against the then,43
NA,"Labor member for Kingston, Gordon Bilney.",43
NA,I have known Gordon Bilney for a fair pe-,43
NA,"riod of time, including before he became a",43
NA,member of parliament. We were both in the,43
NA,Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade,43
NA,"together. But, curiously enough, I did not",43
NA,is want to see the Democrats win the seat from,43
NA,"the Labor Party, because I believed that if the",43
NA,Democrats won Kingston then that would,43
NA,have given the Democrats a beachhead,43
NA,"which they would have been able to build on,",43
NA,and in time the Democrats would have be-,43
NA,come a significant third force in Australian,43
NA,"politics, rather akin to the British Liberal",43
NA,Democrats.,43
NA,I recall working quite closely with Gordon,43
NA,Bilney to ensure that the Democrats did not,43
NA,"win that seat-in other words, that Janine",43
NA,"Haines did not win. I can only say that, in the",43
NA,interests of the diminishing support for the,43
NA,"Democrats, Janine Haines's failure to win",43
NA,that seat was a very significant development.,43
NA,"If she had won that seat, I think the Democ-",43
NA,ever rats would have made a beachhead into the,43
NA,House of Representatives. I think she would,43
NA,have been a very significant and forceful,43
NA,figure in the House of Representatives. For,43
NA,those of us who have had significant Democ-,43
NA,"rat votes in our own electorates, it would",43
NA,have been a very major problem for us in,43
NA,terms of holding our seats. I have to confess,43
NA,some self-interest in that regard.,43
NA,"In conclusion, I think she was the most",43
NA,substantial and the most significant leader,43
NA,the Australian Democrats have had. She was,43
NA,"a very good woman, a very honourable",43
NA,woman. I extend my condolences to her hus-,43
NA,"band, Ian, and to her children, Bronwyn and",43
NA,Melanie.,43
The SPEAKER,As a mark of respect to,43
NA,"the memory of Janine Haines, I invite all",43
NA,honourable members to rise in their places.,43
NA,Honourable members having stood in,43
NA,their places-,43
The SPEAKER,I thank the House.,43
NA,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,44
Mr ANDERSON ,Gwydir-Acting,44
NA,Prime Minister) (2.16 p.m.)-I inform the,44
NA,House that the Prime Minister will be absent,44
NA,"from question time today, tomorrow and",44
NA,"Wednesday. He is, as members know, travel-",44
NA,ling to Laos to attend the ASEAN summit. I,44
NA,will answer questions on the Prime Minis-,44

NA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,44
NA,Regional Services: Program Funding,44
Mr LATHAM ,2.17 p.m.)-My question,44
NA,is to the Acting Prime Minister and Minister,44
NA,for Transport and Regional Services. Can the,44
NA,minister confirm that the guidelines for the,44
NA,Regional Partnerships program require that,44
NA,formal applications must be made for the,44
NA,"funding, that applications can be made on an",44
NA,application form obtained from the local,44
NA,ACC or from the Commonwealth Regional,44
NA,Information Service and that all application,44
NA,forms are to be lodged with the minister's,44
NA,department? Were these guidelines followed,44
NA,in relation to all of the Regional Partnerships,44
NA,projects for which funding has been an-,44
NA,nounced?,44
Mr ANDERSON,I thank the honour-,44
NA,able member for his question. Broadly,44
NA,"speaking, he has outlined the processes that",44
NA,apply when community groups want to apply,44
NA,"for Regional Partnerships funding. However,",44
NA,"I would make the point that this government,",44
NA,"just like all political parties, does choose",44
NA,from time to time to make election commit-,44
NA,ments which are not necessarily-,44
NA,Honourable members interjecting-,44
Mr ANDERSON,You do; you did. You,44
NA,"made a lot of them, and they were subject to",44
NA,no guidelines. Even Independents make,44
NA,commitments during an election campaign.,44
NA,"Mr Speaker, there is nothing unusual or im-",44
NA,proper about that. You made commitments,44
NA,during the election campaign and so did we.,44
NA,"For reasons of convenience and probity,",44
NA,many of those will be channelled through the,44
NA,expertise of the Regional Partnerships pro-,44
NA,gram section maintained in my department.,44
NA,"Mr Speaker, I make the point again. You",44
NA,made election commitments and every po-,44
NA,"litical party, I suspect, for decades has done",44
NA,so. There is nothing wrong or improper about,44
NA,that.,44
The SPEAKER,Could I remind all,44
NA,honourable members that I would like re-,44
NA,marks to be directed through the chair.,44
NA,Economy: Current Account Deficit,44
Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP ,2.19 p.m.)-,44
NA,My question without notice is to the Treas-,44
NA,urer. Would the Treasurer inform the House,44
NA,of today's balance of payments data? What,44
NA,are the economic implications arising from,44
NA,these data?,44
Mr COSTELLO,I thank the honour-,44
NA,able member for Mackellar for her question.,44
NA,"Today, the Australian Bureau of Statistics",44
NA,released the balance of payments for the Sep-,44
NA,tember quarter of 2004. The current account,44
NA,deficit widened by $1.9 billion in the Sep-,44
NA,tember quarter to $13.7 billion-around 6½,44
NA,per cent of GDP. While import volumes only,44
NA,"rose by 0.8 per cent, they are up 13½ per",44
NA,"cent over the year. For the quarter, export",44
NA,"volumes fell 3.2 per cent, but remain 4.7 per",44
NA,"cent higher over the year. In particular, ex-",44
NA,"ports of rural goods fell 3.9 per cent, which",44
NA,was driven by lower exports of wool and,44
NA,"sheepskins. In addition to that, non-rural",44
NA,goods fell four per cent for the quarter. As,45
NA,"Australia emerged from drought, we had a",45
NA,very good wheat crop in the earlier part of,45
NA,2004. Indications for 2004-05 are that the,45
NA,wheat crop will be lower than it was for,45
NA,"2004, which means we are coming off a",45
NA,higher base in relation to rural commodities.,45
NA,One of the things that is undoubtedly,45
NA,lenging Australia's exports at the moment is,45
NA,"the level of the Australian dollar, which is",45
NA,currently about 10c higher than its post-float,45
NA,average over the last 20 years in US dollar,45
NA,terms. This was the subject of discussion at,45
NA,the G20 meeting of finance ministers and,45
NA,central bankers in Berlin last weekend. The,45
NA,"United States, with its own current account",45
NA,"problems, has the US dollar falling against",45
NA,"most currencies in the world, particularly the",45
NA,euro and the yen. While that will be advanta-,45
NA,"geous for the United States, those other cur-",45
NA,rencies which are appreciating against a fal-,45
NA,"ling US dollar will, as a consequence, find",45
NA,that their export competitiveness has been,45
NA,affected and that will make things harder for,45
NA,their exporters.,45
NA,I acknowledge that the level of the cur-,45
NA,rency has made things harder for Australian,45
NA,"exporters. In part, this is because of com-",45
NA,"modity prices but, largely, it is because",45
NA,"falling US dollar which, as I said, is falling",45
NA,against the major currencies of the world. It,45
NA,would certainly be helpful if that adjustment,45
NA,on the US dollar were shared by a wider,45
NA,range of currencies than is currently the case,45
NA,at the moment. We expect that it will be a,45
NA,challenging year for exporters. As a conse-,45
NA,"quence, net exports will detract from the",45
NA,"tional accounts, which are going to be re-",45
NA,leased on Wednesday of this week. It is im-,45
NA,portant that we make all efforts to keep our,45
NA,economy competitive so that Australia's ex-,45
NA,ports can cope with those difficult trading,45
NA,positions.,45
NA,Regional Services: Program Funding,45
Mr LATHAM ,2.22 p.m.)-My question,45
NA,is to the Acting Prime Minister and Minister,45
NA,for Transport and Regional Services. I refer,45
NA,to the minister's funding announcement-not,45
NA,an election commitment but a funding an-,45
NA,nouncement-on 24 September that the gov-,45
NA,chalernment had committed $4 million to fund,45
NA,"the R.M. Williams bush centre in Eidsvold,",45
NA,in the seat of Hinkler. Can the minister con-,45
NA,firm the statement by the Chief Executive,45
NA,Officer of the Eidsvold Shire Council on 24,45
NA,November that funding had been approved,45
NA,even though ‘we haven't put an application,45
NA,in yet'? Why did the minister fund a project,45
NA,for which an application had not even been,45
NA,lodged?,45
Mr ANDERSON,This particular pro-,45
NA,"gram, as the two members who have been",45
NA,"involved in it will know, had an extraordi-",45
NA,"nary, long history. It had been subjected to",45
NA,quite rigorous examination over a long pe-,45
NA,riod of time. It is a very good program. I,45
NA,would be interested to know whether the,45
NA,Leader of the Opposition is going to go up,45
NA,there and tell people that it is not a good pro-,45
NA,gram and that it should not go ahead. The,45
NA,"mayor has written, making it quite evident",45
NA,of a that he regarded an application as having,45
NA,been made. There is an enormous amount of,45
NA,information available on it. I am happy to,45
NA,table all of that information.,45
NA,The fact remains that it is a quality pro-,45
NA,"gram that the government, as part of its elec-",45
NA,"tion campaign, determined it would support,",45
NA,just as the Leader of the Opposition and his,45
NA,na- senior frontbench people wandered around,45
NA,the country giving clear indications of a very,45
NA,wide-ranging number of programs that they,45
NA,would support should the Australian people,45
NA,have chosen them for government. Just a few,45
NA,days ago the Leader of the Opposition said,45
NA,that one of the things he was going to do as,45
NA,soon as he got back here was to hold us to all,45
NA,"of our election promises, so that we would",46
NA,commit ourselves to doing everything that,46
NA,we said we would do during the campaign.,46
NA,We intend doing precisely that.,46
NA,There is nothing illegitimate at all about,46
NA,us putting before the people an entire range,46
NA,"of policy positions, from economic manage-",46
NA,ment-where you did not do very much-,46
NA,social policy and a whole range of issues on,46
NA,foreign affairs right through to the issues,46
NA,how you might respond to good ideas that,46
NA,are thrown up by local communities. You,46
NA,"found plenty of them, I would have to say. I",46
NA,could read out the list if you would like. I,46
NA,would like to know what sort of due process,46
NA,"you thought they should go through, particu-",46
NA,larly the offer of $150 million to the New,46
NA,South Wales government to fix the Murwil-,46
NA,lumbah-Casino railway line-a state gov-,46
NA,ernment responsibility; they closed it. The,46
NA,only independent assessment of what that,46
NA,might cost to fix was done by Pricewater-,46
NA,houseCoopers. The Leader of the Opposition,46
NA,offered his mate Mr Carr $150 million to do,46
NA,it. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated that,46
NA,$25 million was required and you were going,46
NA,to give Mr Carr $150 million. Where was the,46
NA,due diligence in that? A bit of a profit for,46
NA,"your mate Bob Carr in New South Wales,",46
NA,presumably to fix up the transport mess he,46
NA,has in the Sydney basin. I reckon the com-,46
NA,mitments we made will stack up to a lot,46
NA,"more scrutiny than those that you made, and",46
NA,we have every intention of honouring the,46
NA,commitments we made during the campaign.,46
NA,"Mr Latham- Mr Speaker, I rise on a",46
NA,point of order. The Acting Prime Minister,46
NA,said he was happy to table all the documen-,46
NA,tation about the funding application for the,46
NA,"R.M. Williams centre, so I ask him to do that",46
NA,for the benefit of the House.,46
NA,Mr Anderson-I am happy to make that,46
NA,available. I will pull it together and make,46
NA,available.,46
NA,Transport: AusLink,46
Mr HARTSUYKER ,2.26 p.m.)-My,46
NA,question is addressed to the Acting Prime,46
NA,Minister. Would the Acting Prime Minister,46
NA,advise the House on the progress towards,46
NA,implementing the AusLink transport policy?,46
NA,What are the benefits of this policy?,46
Mr ANDERSON,AusLink will revolu-,46
NA,tionise the way that this country faces its,46
NA,"of transport task, which is growing very rapidly.",46
NA,It will provide Australia with a long-term,46
NA,plan for our vital infrastructure in terms of,46
NA,transport needs. I have to say that without a,46
NA,better way of doing it in the future we will,46
NA,sell Australians short. Under this program we,46
NA,have allocated some $12.5 billion over the,46
NA,next five years. In today's money that is,46
NA,more than twice what was spent on the,46
NA,Snowy Mountains Scheme. As part of that,46
NA,process we will see in this country for the,46
NA,"first time an open, transparent transport fund-",46
NA,ing framework freed up of ad hoc and short-,46
NA,term decision making processes.,46
NA,The fact is that a rapidly growing econ-,46
NA,omy is resulting in a very steep rise in the,46
NA,escalation of our transport task. At the rate,46
NA,"that it is building, in the future our roads will",46
NA,not cope with the level of freight that is be-,46
NA,"ing put on them, so it is essential that our rail",46
NA,network is brought up to scratch. The leasing,46
NA,of the interstate track in New South Wales,46
NA,"for a period of 60 years, the commitment to",46
NA,spend some $1.8 billion on it over the next,46
NA,"five years and, in cooperation with the states",46
NA,to streamline and facilitate the access ar-,46
NA,"rangements, the safety arrangements and the",46
NA,signalling arrangements across this creaking,46
NA,network will see a dramatic improvement,46
NA,over the next five years.,46
NA,So I make the point that we desperately,46
NA,need a nationally coordinated approach to,46
NA,our transport planning needs. We need ade-,46
NA,it quate resources. For reasons of economic,46
NA,"growth, amenity, convenience and better en-",46
NA,"vironmental outcomes, we need to ensure",47
NA,that it is done properly in the future. I believe,47
NA,that the community wants to see a greater,47
NA,emphasis on transport infrastructure and on,47
NA,"infrastructure more generally, and I would",47
NA,suggest that the absence of a coherent trans-,47
NA,port plan from the opposition during the re-,47
NA,cent campaign would hardly have helped,47
NA,them electorally. It is about time they came,47
NA,"forward with a decent, coherent explanation",47
NA,as to how they will develop our transport,47
NA,infrastructure for the future.,47
NA,Regional Services: Program Funding,47
Mr LATHAM ,2.29 p.m.)-My question,47
NA,is again to the Acting Prime Minister and,47
NA,Minister for Transport and Regional Ser-,47
NA,vices. Can the minister inform the House,47
NA,which projects under the Regional Partner-,47
NA,ships program have been funded without,47
NA,applications being lodged in accordance with,47
NA,the guidelines?,47
Mr ANDERSON,I thank the honour-,47
NA,able Leader of the Opposition for his ques-,47
NA,"tion. The answer is: to this point in time,",47
NA,none. We have given election commitments;,47
NA,we will work those through in the proper,47
NA,way. Contrary to the impression being cre-,47
NA,ated by some in the opposition-including,47
NA,Senator O'Brien with his 45 questions on,47
NA,"notice-the answer is: to this point in time,",47
NA,none of them.,47
NA,Association of South-East Asian Nations,47
Dr SOUTHCOTT ,2.30 p.m.)-My,47
NA,question is addressed to the Minister for For-,47
NA,eign Affairs. Would the minister inform the,47
NA,House of the significance of the ASEAN-,47
NA,Australia-New Zealand summit for Austra-,47
NA,lia's relationship with South-East Asia?,47
Mr DOWNER,I thank the honourable,47
NA,member for Boothby for his question. The,47
NA,government is delighted that the Prime Min-,47
NA,ister is able to attend the historic ASEAN-,47
NA,"Australia-New Zealand summit, which will",47
NA,take place tonight and tomorrow in Vienti-,47
NA,"ane. Amongst other things, this summit will",47
NA,mark the 30th anniversary of Australia be-,47
NA,"coming an ASEAN dialogue partner. Indeed,",47
NA,I think I am right in saying that Australia was,47
NA,the first ASEAN dialogue partner.,47
NA,This summit is a key recognition not only,47
NA,of the importance of ASEAN to Australia but,47
NA,of the importance of Australia to ASEAN.,47
NA,We are optimistic that a key outcome of the,47
NA,summit will be the beginning of negotiations,47
NA,towards establishing something that I think is,47
NA,"extremely desirable-that is, an ASEAN-",47
NA,Australia-New Zealand free trade area or,47
NA,"free trade agreement. That would build, of",47
NA,"course, on the strong commercial links that",47
NA,already exist between Australia and the,47
NA,"ASEAN countries, on the free trade agree-",47
NA,ments we have negotiated with Thailand and,47
NA,Singapore and on the work we are doing,47
NA,with Malaysia.,47
NA,The summit is also an opportunity to re-,47
NA,flect the depth and range of our ties with,47
NA,"ASEAN, from counter-terrorism-Australia",47
NA,and ASEAN signed a joint declaration on,47
NA,"counter-terrorism on 1 July, and we have",47
NA,counter-terrorism memoranda of understand-,47
NA,ing with a number of ASEAN countries-to,47
NA,the defence and security relationships that,47
NA,"we have built up, in different forms with dif-",47
NA,ferent countries in ASEAN; with all of them,47
NA,we have some measure of a defence and se-,47
NA,curity relationship. We have excellent coop-,47
NA,eration with ASEAN on drug trafficking and,47
NA,"people-smuggling, to the extent that we have",47
NA,as good as stopped people-smuggling from,47
NA,being directed to Australia.,47
NA,Our people-to-people links have continued,47
NA,"to grow, too-through students, for example.",47
NA,"There are 75,000 students from ASEAN",47
NA,"countries studying in Australia, and over",47
NA,"600,000 tourists from South-East Asia vis-",47
NA,ited Australia in 2003.,47
NA,"Finally, we make a strong aid commitment",47
NA,every year to a number of ASEAN coun-,47
NA,"tries-obviously, not to all of them. To those",48
NA,ASEAN countries that are eligible for the,48
NA,"receipt of development assistance in 2004,",48
NA,we will be providing about $400 million,48
NA,worth of aid.,48
NA,This summit is an opportunity for heads of,48
NA,"government, including our own, to draw to-",48
NA,gether the threads of a very comprehensive,48
NA,and very successful relationship-one that,48
NA,has continued to build over many years. I,48
NA,think that both sides of the House have been,48
NA,"committed to the relationship, but equally-",48
NA,and it is important to remember this-it,48
NA,needs to be a two-way relationship. I think,48
NA,that we as a country have in recent years,48
NA,demonstrated not just the importance of,48
NA,ASEAN to Australia but the importance of,48
NA,Australia to the ASEAN countries.,48
NA,Association of South-East Asian Nations,48
Mr RUDD ,2.33 p.m.)-My question is,48
NA,to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to,48
NA,his explanation that Australia could not enter,48
NA,into the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation,48
NA,"with ASEAN, because of the alliance rela-",48
NA,tionship that Australia has with the United,48
NA,"States. Is the minister aware that Japan, a",48
NA,"longstanding ally of the United States, signed",48
NA,the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation with,48
NA,ASEAN in February this year? Is the minis-,48
NA,"ter aware that South Korea, another long-",48
NA,"standing ally of the US, did the same on Sat-",48
NA,urday? Given that other longstanding allies,48
NA,"of the US have signed the treaty, why won't",48
NA,the government abandon its Howard doctrine,48
NA,of regional military pre-emption and indicate,48
NA,that Australia will give positive consideration,48
NA,to acceding to the Treaty of Amity and Co-,48
NA,operation with ASEAN?,48
Mr DOWNER,The Labor Party had 13,48
NA,years in government to sign the Treaty of,48
NA,"Amity and Cooperation with ASEAN, and",48
NA,the Labor Party chose not to. The Labor,48
NA,Party then-,48
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,48
Mr DOWNER,I haven't finished yet.,48
NA,The Labor Party then had 8½ years in oppo-,48
NA,sition to say it would sign the Treaty of,48
NA,Amity and Cooperation. This is just another,48
NA,"example of a wasted 8½ years, I assume; you",48
NA,did not think of it in those 8½ years.,48
NA,The traditional Australian position on the,48
NA,Treaty of Amity and Cooperation has nothing,48
NA,to do with the notion of pre-emption-,48
NA,absolutely nothing to do with it at all. It is a,48
NA,treaty based on a series of principles. Some,48
NA,of them are the principles of the United Na-,48
NA,"tions Charter, and one of the principles of the",48
NA,United Nations Charter is the right to self-,48
NA,defence. It is nothing to do with the notion of,48
NA,pre-emption. Other principles that the Treaty,48
NA,"of Amity and Cooperation is based on are,",48
NA,"among other things, the so-called 10 princi-",48
NA,ples of the Bandung Declaration of the,48
NA,1950s. One of the components of the Band-,48
NA,ung Declaration was that governments that,48
NA,signed up to the Treaty of Amity and Coop-,48
NA,eration would abstain from the use of ar-,48
NA,rangements of collective defence to serve the,48
NA,particular interests of any of the big powers.,48
NA,"Bearing that in mind, successive Austra-",48
NA,lian governments-not just this one-have,48
NA,interpreted that particular principle as one,48
NA,that would be inconsistent with the ANZUS,48
NA,alliance. That obviously has been one of the,48
NA,reasons historically why Australian govern-,48
NA,ments have not signed the treaty. Another,48
NA,reason is that it is a treaty that contains a,48
NA,provision for noninterference in the internal,48
NA,"affairs of other countries. Therefore, it raises",48
NA,"questions about whether, if you signed the",48
NA,treaty and you meant to sign it in a genuine,48
NA,way-taking seriously the provisions of the,48
NA,treaty-you would not interfere in the affairs,48
NA,"of another country; you would not, for ex-",48
NA,"ample, criticise Burma, Myanmar, for human",48
NA,rights abuses.,48
NA,These are the traditional reasons why Aus-,48
NA,tralia has not signed the treaty. The govern-,48
NA,"ment has not changed its position, on the",49
NA,basis of those explanations. The reasons that,49
NA,"Gareth Evans, Paul Keating and Bob Hawke",49
NA,gave for not signing the treaty are the rea-,49
NA,sons we give today.,49
NA,Association of South-East Asian Nations,49
Mr JULL ,2.37 p.m.)-My question is,49
NA,addressed to the Minister for Trade. What,49
NA,benefits are to be had by Australia from a,49
NA,free trade pact with ASEAN?,49
Mr VAILE,I thank the honourable,49
NA,member for Fadden for his question. But,49
NA,"firstly, I take the opportunity to congratulate",49
NA,"you, Mr Speaker, on your election to the high",49
NA,office of Speaker of the House of Represen-,49
NA,tatives-I was not here for the last two days,49
NA,of the previous sitting week. The answer to,49
NA,the member for Fadden's question is very,49
NA,simple: more and better jobs for Australians,49
NA,and Australian exporting industries. That is,49
NA,what the outcome of negotiating a free trade,49
NA,agreement with the 10 ASEAN countries will,49
NA,"be. Of course, this has not just happened. It",49
NA,is the result of a lot of hard work by a num-,49
NA,"ber of people, particularly through the gov-",49
NA,ernment's persistent trade diplomacy within,49
NA,the region. We started this process at,49
NA,ing of trade ministers in Singapore in 1999.,49
NA,Opposition member interjecting-,49
Mr VAILE,Who is that up on the back,49
NA,bench interjecting?,49
NA,Honourable members interjecting-,49
Mr VAILE,It is a senator. There is a,49
NA,stranger in the House! We started this proc-,49
NA,ess in 1999 in a meeting of trade ministers,49
NA,and we have been building on the strength of,49
NA,Australian trade diplomacy within the re-,49
NA,gion. We add this to the architecture of a free,49
NA,"trade agreement with Singapore, with Thai-",49
NA,land and with the study that we are doing,49
NA,"with Malaysia and China at the moment, and",49
NA,it sets us up with great opportunities in the,49
NA,coming years within the region.,49
NA,We are targeting in terms of strengthening,49
NA,and greater integration economically with the,49
NA,10 ASEAN countries. Within those 10 coun-,49
NA,tries there is a population of 545 million con-,49
NA,sumers and a GDP of around $700 billion.,49
NA,An FTA with the ASEAN countries will cre-,49
NA,ate jobs in Australia. It will help further ex-,49
NA,"pand Australia's exports to the region and,",49
NA,"obviously, deepen our economic integration",49
NA,with the region. Regarding the economic,49
NA,"relationship, there is already a $43 billion",49
NA,two-way trade relationship with the 10,49
NA,ASEAN countries and a $46 billion two-way,49
NA,"investment relationship. As I say, building",49
NA,upon the other bilateral negotiations that we,49
NA,"have concluded in the region, this augurs",49
NA,well for improved exports within our,49
NA,neighbourhood in the east Asian region. An,49
NA,"FTA between Australia, New Zealand and",49
NA,the ASEAN countries would complement our,49
NA,already profitable trade agenda in our pursuit,49
NA,of the multilateral outcomes of the Doha,49
NA,Round as well as our bilateral negotiations,49
NA,"that have already been concluded, which",49
NA,have been adding their weight to the 1.4 mil-,49
NA,lion new jobs that have been created in the,49
NA,Australian economy since our government,49
NA,a meet- was originally elected in 1996.,49
NA,"I go back to my starting point, for the in-",49
NA,formation of the member for Fadden. This,49
NA,outcome had its genesis in that meeting in,49
NA,Singapore in 1999 where we moved on to,49
NA,negotiate and conclude a closer economic,49
NA,partnership agreement with the ASEAN,49
NA,countries and things have now culminated in,49
NA,this summit in Vientiane at which the Prime,49
NA,Minister is representing Australia. If the La-,49
NA,bor Party had been in a position in govern-,49
NA,"ment to do this, they would have. They were",49
NA,not and they did not.,49
NA,Economy: Foreign Debt,49
Mr SWAN ,2.41 p.m.)-My question,49
NA,without notice is directed to the Treasurer. Is,49
NA,it true that Australia's record $406 billion,49
NA,foreign debt reported today is more than,50
NA,"double the size it was in 1996, more than 50",50
NA,per cent of GDP for the first time ever and,50
NA,"more than $20,000 of debt for every man,",50
NA,"woman and child? Treasurer, do you believe",50
NA,this continued growth in debt is sustainable,50
NA,and what are its implications for interest,50
NA,rates?,50
Mr COSTELLO,I thank the honour-,50
NA,able member for his question. I can give you,50
NA,"the figures. In 1996, foreign debt was 39 per",50
NA,cent of the Australian economy and today it,50
NA,"is 50 per cent, so it has not doubled. He is",50
NA,wrong in relation to that. Do I believe that,50
NA,Australia would be well served if the current,50
NA,account deficit were lower? Yes. I have made,50
NA,that point on a number of occasions. It is,50
NA,about the same level that it was back in,50
NA,"1994, but there are important differences",50
NA,between now and 1994. The most important,50
NA,"difference of course is that, back in 1994,",50
NA,budget deficit was 2.8 per cent of GDP-that,50
NA,"is, the Commonwealth was running down",50
NA,savings-whereas today the Commonwealth,50
NA,"budget is in surplus; that is, the Common-",50
NA,"wealth is adding to savings. Back in 1994,",50
NA,"inflation was 3.9 per cent and, since I was",50
NA,"asked about interest rates, back in 1994 the",50
NA,home mortgage variable interest rate was,50
NA,10½ per cent.,50
NA,I thought I would refer to one of the,50
NA,speeches that was made back in 1994 on this,50
NA,question of foreign debt. It always pays to,50
NA,acquaint yourself with history. It was by a,50
NA,"young member for Werriwa, who was speak-",50
NA,ing on the appropriation bills and was highly,50
NA,critical of the honourable member for,50
NA,O'Connor. There is no-one on this side of the,50
NA,House that would be critical of the member,50
NA,for O'Connor.,50
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,50
Mr COSTELLO,I do thank the hon-,50
NA,ourable member for Lilley for his ‘Kylie'.,50
NA,On 17 November 1994 the member for Wer-,50
NA,riwa got up in this House during that episode,50
NA,and said:,50
NA,The honourable member for O'Connor ... has,50
NA,again displayed the opposition's confusion on,50
NA,economic policy and its occasional tendency to-,50
NA,wards xenophobia on issues such as the current,50
NA,account deficit and foreign debt. The truth is that,50
NA,the current account deficit is the equivalent of the,50
NA,capital ... inflow. Capital inflow into Australia is a,50
NA,huge vote of confidence by international investors,50
NA,in the strength of our economy.,50
NA,If that is the way the member for Werriwa,50
NA,"saw it in 1994, today's figures must be an",50
NA,even huger vote of confidence. I asked ear-,50
NA,lier: would it be better if Australia's current,50
NA,account were lower? Yes. Would it be better,50
NA,if our exporters were more competitive? Yes.,50
NA,What is the key thing that is working against,50
NA,Australia's exporters at the moment? The,50
NA,exchange rate. You cannot have it both ways.,50
NA,I can remember the opposition coming into,50
NA,"the parliament, led by the member for Hotham,",50
NA,complaining when the Australian dollar was,50
NA,at 47c to the US dollar. Today it is at around,50
NA,78c or 79c-that is double. That does affect,50
NA,your competitiveness and the competitive-,50
NA,ness of Australia's exporters. That is why it,50
NA,is important that this economy be kept com-,50
NA,petitive. The day we hear about the Austra-,50
NA,lian Labor Party supporting industrial rela-,50
NA,tions reform to help Australia's exporters is,50
NA,the day that we will know the Australian La-,50
NA,bor Party does intend to change its spots and,50
NA,does intend to support economic credibility,50
NA,in this country.,50
NA,Demographic Trends,50
Mr MCARTHUR ,2.45 p.m.)-My ques-,50
NA,tion is addressed to the Treasurer. Has the,50
NA,Treasurer seen a Productivity Commission,50
NA,report highlighting the need for government,50
NA,action now to combat the long-term effects,50
NA,of demographic change? How is the gov-,50
NA,"ernment responding, and what are the alter-",50
NA,native policies?,50
Mr COSTELLO,I thank the honour-,51
NA,able member for Corangamite for his ques-,51
NA,"tion. This is the government that, as part of",51
NA,"its Charter of Budget Honesty, required an",51
NA,Intergenerational Report to be prepared for,51
NA,the first time in 2002 and benchmarking of,51
NA,progress each five years thereafter. In addi-,51
NA,"tion to that, at the request of the Council",51
NA,Australian Governments I asked the Produc-,51
NA,tivity Commission to do its own projections,51
NA,"in relation to the ageing of Australia's popuance,",51
NA,lation.,51
NA,The draft report of the Productivity Com-,51
NA,mission largely endorses the Treasury fore-,51
NA,casts and says that Australia's ageing of the,51
NA,population could open up a gap between,51
NA,revenue and outlays-state and federal-of,51
NA,the dimension of around seven per cent in 40,51
NA,years time. This is because the work force,51
NA,age population in Australia is hardly going,51
NA,change but the number of people of retire-,51
NA,"ment age is going to double, or more than",51
NA,"double, over the next 40 years. In particular,",51
NA,the costs in relation to medical care-not,51
NA,only because older people draw down more,51
NA,on medical care but because new drugs and,51
NA,new techniques are being invented-are go-,51
NA,ing to put considerable pressure on the,51
NA,Commonwealth account.,51
NA,What is the government doing to address,51
NA,these challenges? We are taking measures to,51
NA,increase participation amongst the work,51
NA,force population. We are taking measures to,51
NA,increase productivity. We have announced an,51
NA,increase in the preservation age for superan-,51
NA,nuation to 60 and an increase in the age pen-,51
NA,sion age for women to 65. We announced at,51
NA,the last election a mature age tax offset to,51
NA,encourage Australians aged 55 to remain in,51
NA,the work force. We have announced changes,51
NA,to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to,51
NA,base that scheme on a sustainable basis.,51
NA,There were a lot of opposition spokesmen,51
NA,and spokeswomen out on the weekend. One,51
NA,of them was the honourable member for,51
NA,Melbourne. He spoke quite a lot of sense on,51
NA,the weekend: he went out and warned of the,51
NA,"Medicare Gold Labor Party policy, which",51
NA,would add a substantial burden to future fed-,51
NA,eral budgets. He was right about that. There,51
NA,has probably never been a more irresponsible,51
NA,of promise made. In the context of an ageing,51
NA,"population and increasing health care, there",51
NA,"was an offer, without private health insur-",51
NA,of free first-class private health care to,51
NA,everybody over 75-a cohort of people that,51
NA,we know is going to grow and grow over the,51
NA,next 40 years. There has probably never been,51
NA,a more expensive promise made.,51
NA,Where does the Australian Labor Party,51
NA,stand on Medicare Gold today? When I was,51
NA,"a kid there used to be an ad that said, ‘Don't",51
NA,wait to be told; you need Palmolive Gold.',51
NA,to Don't wait to be told; ditch Medicare Gold.,51
NA,The member for Melbourne was out there,51
NA,belling the cat on the weekend. Medicare,51
NA,Gold is a promise which is irresponsible. It is,51
NA,a promise which no government in Australia,51
NA,"in 40 years, let alone 30 years or 20 years,",51
NA,would possibly be able to honour.,51
NA,The Australian Labor Party have now,51
NA,conceded they lost the last election because,51
NA,they had no economic credibility. That is,51
NA,their own analysis. And the Australian Labor,51
NA,"Party now say, ‘We are determined to be-",51
NA,come credible.' You will not be credible if,51
NA,you maintain the policies that led to the loss,51
NA,of credibility. It is more than signing bits of,51
NA,cardboard. Economic credibility comes from,51
NA,policy. Until such time as the Australian La-,51
NA,bor Party change their policy on Medicare,51
NA,"Gold, change their policy on industrial rela-",51
NA,"tions, change their policy on unfair dismissal",51
NA,and change their policy on the Pharmaceuti-,51
NA,cal Benefits Scheme-which they opposed,51
NA,and then they supported and now they op-,51
NA,pose-,51
NA,Ms Gillard-What are you on about?,51
Mr COSTELLO,That is what hap-,52
NA,pened in the campaign with co-,52
NA,contributions-one wonders where it is up to,52
NA,now. In the confused menagerie that the Aus-,52
NA,"tralian Labor Party today represents, the",52
NA,Leader of the Opposition calls his economic,52
NA,spokesmen ‘roosters'. The member for Lyons,52
NA,calls the member for Grayndler a ‘mangy,52
NA,dog'. The member for Brand has his chief of,52
NA,staff out describing the Leader of the Oppo-,52
NA,sition as a ‘dead parrot'. Those of you that,52
NA,"watch Monty Python, as I do, please go back",52
NA,and have a look at the video. On the week-,52
NA,"end, a rooster declared a jihad on a dead par-",52
NA,rot! My head was spinning! This is the ani-,52
NA,mal farm that the Australian Labor Party now,52
NA,represents. Until it has the opportunity to get,52
NA,"some policy, it will not have economic",52
NA,credibility. Credibility comes from policy.,52
NA,Economy: Foreign Debt,52
Mr SWAN ,2.52 p.m.)-My question,52
NA,without notice is directed to the Treasurer. I,52
NA,ask him whether he recalls making the fol-,52
NA,lowing statement when he was shadow,52
NA,Treasurer and a young member for Higgins:,52
NA,Australia has high foreign debt and because Aus-,52
NA,"tralia has a current account problem, that puts",52
NA,"premium on Australian borrowings, that flows",52
NA,through and every Australian pays for the conse-,52
NA,quences.,52
NA,"Treasurer, do you still agree with that state-",52
NA,ment?,52
Mr COSTELLO,I have already an-,52
NA,"swered this question. Firstly, comparing the",52
NA,current account deficit in 2004 to the current,52
NA,account deficit in 1994: as I have already,52
NA,"indicated, in 1994, when the current account",52
NA,"deficit was 6½ per cent of GDP, the budget",52
NA,"was in deficit to 2.8 per cent-that is, the",52
NA,Commonwealth government was a borrower,52
NA,and a large reason for the run-down in sav-,52
NA,ings. Now the Commonwealth government is,52
NA,a saver. The Commonwealth government is,52
NA,making no impact at all on foreign borrow-,52
NA,"ings. Secondly, as I have already pointed out,",52
NA,the home mortgage variable interest rate was,52
NA,10½ per cent compared to 7.05 per cent to-,52
NA,day. Interest rates were higher.,52
NA,I do want to make one other point. Back in,52
NA,1994 Australia's foreign currency borrowing,52
NA,credit rate had been downgraded not once,52
NA,but twice. It was downgraded in 1986 at the,52
NA,time of ‘banana republic' and it was down-,52
NA,graded again in the late eighties. Since this,52
NA,"government was elected, Australia's foreign",52
NA,currency borrowing credit rating has been,52
NA,"revised upward not once but twice-that is,",52
NA,Australia now enjoys a AAA credit rating on,52
NA,foreign currency borrowings. What deter-,52
NA,mines a premium on your borrowing is your,52
NA,credit rating. A credit rating allows a lender,52
NA,"to trade off risk against margin. So, if your",52
NA,"credit rating is down, the risk premium",52
NA,which a lender will want in turn to lend to,52
NA,you is higher. This is the government that,52
NA,recovered Australia's AAA credit rating in,52
NA,the international markets. That has made all,52
NA,the difference. That is one of reasons why,52

NA,Ukraine: Election,52
Mrs MOYLAN ,2.55 p.m.)-My ques-,52
NA,tion is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.,52
NA,Would the minister inform the House of the,52
NA,government's position on recent political,52
NA,developments in the Ukraine?,52
Mr DOWNER,"First, I thank the mem-",52
NA,ber for Pearce for her question. I appreciate,52
NA,the concern she shows about the situation in,52
NA,Ukraine. Just before question time today I,52
NA,met with the Ambassador of Ukraine and,52
NA,expressed yet again the Australian govern-,52
NA,ment's deep concern about the irregularities,52
NA,which clearly took place in the Ukrainian,52
NA,presidential elections on 21 November. It is,52
NA,clear from the reports of international ob-,52
NA,servers that this election fell well short of,52
NA,international standards. There was a suspi-,53
NA,ciously high voter turnout in several regions.,53
NA,There was fraudulent use of absentee voting.,53
NA,State employees were pressured to vote for,53
NA,"Mr Yanukovich, the Prime Minister. There",53
NA,was abuse of state resources and overt media,53
NA,bias. In these circumstances Australia cannot,53
NA,accept the official result. We cannot accept,53
NA,that this result reflects the will of the UkrainUnder,53
NA,"ian people. I note-and, as members of par-",53
NA,"liament, we should all note-that the Ukra-",53
NA,nian parliament has passed a resolution de-,53
NA,claring the results invalid. The supreme court,53
NA,of the Ukraine will consider today whether,53
NA,the general election commission acted prop-,53
NA,erly in declaring Mr Yanukovich the winner.,53
NA,"I can only make one other comment,",53
NA,which is that I would be pretty sure I spoke,53
NA,on behalf of all members of this parliament if,53
NA,I said that we have been pleased to see the,53
NA,people of Ukraine express their will in a very,53
NA,peaceful way through demonstrations in,53
NA,Kiev and other parts of the country. We very,53
NA,much hope that the differences that exist in,53
NA,"Ukraine can be resolved satisfactorily and,",53
NA,"more than that, they can be resolved accord-",53
NA,ing to the good principles of democracy and,53
NA,free and fair elections.,53
NA,Education: Vocational Education and,53
Ms KATE ELLIS ,2.57 p.m.)-My ques-,53
NA,tion is to the Minister for Vocational and,53
NA,Technical Education. Does the minister sup-,53
NA,port special levies or taxes to fund industry,53
NA,strategies dealing with the acute national,53
NA,skill shortage?,53
Mr HARDGRAVE,I thank the member,53
NA,for Adelaide for her question. The short an-,53
NA,"swer is: no, we are not going down the path-",53
NA,way that the Australian Labor Party had in,53
NA,place where they were taxing businesses in,53
NA,order to try and drive a training agenda. In,53
NA,"fact, this government is instead going down",53
NA,the path of encouraging good partnerships,53
NA,with industry to take some of the responsibil-,53
NA,"ity, along with the state and territory gov-",53
NA,"ernments, for the business of ensuring that",53
NA,more people are involved in taking up trade,53
NA,based apprenticeships around Australia. We,53
NA,have had quite a deal of success in this. We,53
NA,have seen enormous numbers of new appren-,53
NA,ticeships developed over the last few years.,53
NA,"the Australian Labor Party, the num-",53
NA,ber of trade based apprenticeships plum-,53
NA,"meted from 160,990 in 1990 to 107,000 in",53
NA,"1994. Today there are 146,400 trade appren-",53
NA,tices in training. We are driving an agenda,53
NA,that is undoing a lot of the mess of the previ-,53
NA,"ous government's neglect. Unfortunately,",53
NA,what we are finding-,53
NA,Ms Macklin interjecting-,53
Mr HARDGRAVE,The member for,53
NA,"Jagajaga is interrupting, but there has been a",53
NA,250 per cent increase in the number of new,53
NA,apprenticeships in her own electorate. The,53
NA,other key point is that all around Australia,53
NA,today we have state governments driving up,53
NA,TAFE charges-charges up front. The up-,53
NA,front fees that are charged to new apprentices,53
NA,are going up all around the country. For in-,53
NA,"stance, there has been a 50 per cent increase",53
NA,in South Australia and a 300 per cent in-,53
NA,crease in New South Wales. The Victorian,53
NA,Training government has driven them up as well. But,53
NA,the latest insult to injury has happened: the,53
NA,Bracks Labor government in Victoria now,53
NA,wants to charge apprentices $30 to receive,53
NA,their completion certificates. So here we,53
NA,"have people who have put it all on the line,",53
NA,worked hard and gained an apprenticeship,53
NA,"and, in order to get the piece of paper to say",53
NA,"they have done the job, the Bracks govern-",53
NA,ment wants to charge them $30 for that cer-,53
NA,tificate.,53
NA,I therefore welcome the member for Ade-,53
NA,"laide's question, because it does raise the",53
NA,question-it is another one of those the,53
NA,"Treasurer would call a ‘Kylie', I suppose. It",53
NA,is time for the Leader of the Opposition to,54
NA,"pick up the phone and ring Steve Bracks, the",54
NA,"Premier of Victoria, and tell him to ease the",54
NA,squeeze on apprenticeships and to end the,54
NA,‘Bracks whack'. But of course the Leader of,54
NA,the Opposition probably cannot pick up that,54
NA,"phone and guarantee he will get put through,",54
NA,so maybe a certain Labor senator from Victo-,54
NA,"ria, Senator Conroy, can do it for him.",54
NA,Environment: Murray-Darling River,54
Mr SECKER ,3.00 p.m.)-My question,54
NA,"is addressed to the Minister for Agriculture,",54
NA,Fisheries and Forestry. Would the minister,54
NA,update the House on the progress of the Liv-,54
NA,"ing Murray initiative, especially with respect",54
NA,to my seat of Barker and with reference to,54
NA,the premiers' withdrawal during the election,54
NA,campaign?,54
Mr TRUSS,I thank the honourable,54
NA,member for Barker for his question. He will,54
NA,be aware that the Murray-Darling Basin has,54
NA,experienced the driest four years in recorded,54
NA,"history, so the reserves of water in the basin",54
NA,are exceptionally low and it will not be pos-,54
NA,sible to meet all of the commitments to irri-,54
NA,gators and other users in the year ahead.,54
NA,"Nonetheless, the Murray-Darling Basin Min-",54
NA,isterial Council is proceeding with plans to,54
NA,develop and implement the Living Murray,54
NA,initiative first step.,54
NA,Honourable members will be aware that,54
NA,six icon sites have been identified where 500,54
NA,gigalitres of water will be used to help im-,54
NA,prove the environmental health of the river.,54
NA,Those sites and the engineering works asso-,54
NA,ciated with putting these projects together,54
NA,have been approved over recent months. At,54
NA,"the meeting last Friday, ministers agreed on",54
NA,four packages of projects in New South,54
NA,Wales and Victoria to provide 240 gigalitres,54
NA,of the water intended for the first stage. That,54
NA,is a very significant step. It is about half,54
NA,volume of Sydney Harbour to be available,54
NA,every year to improve the environmental,54
NA,"health of the river, and it is around half of all",54
NA,the water that will be required for the first,54
NA,"stage. So, well ahead of schedule, around",54
NA,half the water has already been identified for,54
NA,"the Living Murray initiative, and there is",54
NA,about another 70 gigalitres available in pro-,54
NA,jects under development to help make this,54
NA,ambitious plan a reality.,54
NA,What is also important-and I am sure the,54
NA,System honourable member for Barker will be par-,54
NA,ticularly pleased by this-is that none of,54
NA,these projects will require the commission to,54
NA,enter the marketplace or distort the market.,54
NA,This will all come from savings through the,54
NA,system: the cooperation of the various juris-,54
NA,dictions and users of water to help deliver,54
NA,savings to benefit the environment. This is a,54
NA,very significant environmental project for,54
NA,Australia. As soon as the jurisdictions re-,54
NA,commit to the National Water Initiative it,54
NA,will be possible to roll out the environmental,54
NA,projects for these six icon ecological sites,54
NA,along the river and to help build a stronger,54
NA,and healthier river.,54
NA,Can I also mention that the meeting,54
NA,adopted salinity targets for the various river,54
NA,"systems in the Murray-Darling Basin area,",54
NA,and it will release a salinity management,54
NA,strategy to help address this other key prob-,54
NA,lem in the Murray-Darling Basin region.,54
NA,"Finally, I am sure the honourable member,",54
NA,along with other members from South Aus-,54
NA,"tralia, would be interested to know that the",54
NA,council has committed a further $7.5 million,54
NA,towards maintaining the sand pumping and,54
NA,dredging project at the River Murray mouth.,54
NA,"When there is no water, it is simply not pos-",54
NA,"sible for it to be flushed out naturally, so this",54
NA,extensive pumping and dredging arrange-,54
NA,ment will need to continue. Adequate budget,54
NA,funds have been provided to make sure that,54
NA,the the mouth of the river is kept as healthy as,54
NA,possible in these dry times.,54
NA,Education: Vocational Education and,55
NA,Training,55
Ms MACKLIN ,3.04 p.m.)-My ques-,55
NA,tion is to the Minister for Vocational and,55
NA,Technical Education. Is the minister aware,55
NA,that on 4 November the ACCC authorised an,55
NA,industry levy on bricks to address,55
NA,shortage of skilled bricklayers and fund more,55
NA,"apprentices? Minister, won't this levy mean",55
NA,increases in cost to businesses and families?,55
NA,Why has the Howard government let a se-,55
NA,vere skill shortage develop and allowed a,55
NA,levy on families and businesses? In the light,55
NA,"of the minister's earlier answer, what will",55
NA,do to stop the price of bricks increasing as,55
NA,the result of this new levy?,55
Mr HARDGRAVE,I think the member,55
NA,"has really asked the wrong minister, in the",55
NA,"sense that the ACCC is not within my remit,",55
NA,but I am happy to check it all out. What I am,55
NA,"particularly conscious of-and, naturally",55
NA,"enough, concerned about-is that the impact",55
NA,of the state governments' fee increases is,55
NA,driving up the cost to apprentices taking up,55
NA,new apprenticeships.,55
NA,"Ms Macklin- Mr Speaker, I raise a point",55
NA,of order. The point of order is on relevance.,55
NA,This is all about a new industry levy to fund,55
NA,apprenticeships.,55
The SPEAKER,The minister has only,55
NA,"just started answering his question, so there",55
NA,is no point of order.,55
Mr HARDGRAVE," Mr Speaker, it is",55
NA,"also about the area of traditional trades, of",55
NA,which bricklaying is just one. The point that,55
NA,the Labor Party need to understand very,55
NA,"clearly is that, as a direct result of Labor",55
NA,government actions around various states of,55
NA,"Australia, it has become harder for appren-",55
NA,tices to afford the cost of a new apprentice-,55
NA,ship. It is extremely important for the Labor,55
NA,Party to understand the culture of what their,55
NA,own governments at the state level have ac-,55
NA,tually driven. We have done some work with,55
NA,"Access Economics-and Access Economics,",55
NA,"of course, is by no means strange to those",55
NA,opposite-and in fact we have had to revise,55
NA,downwards the projected increase in demand,55
NA,for vocational and technical education over,55
NA,the 2004-06 period from 2.9 per cent to 1.7,55
NA,Australia's per cent in VET hours.,55
NA,That is a result of factoring in the in-,55
NA,creases in the costs of studying in order to,55
NA,get people such as bricklayers out into the,55
NA,workplace. I am happy to look into the spe-,55
NA,cifics the member has asked for but at the,55
NA,end of it those opposite need to understand,55
NA,he that there has been a cultural change in the,55
NA,work force today. Those opposite also need,55
NA,to understand that we are delighted to receive,55
NA,questions on vocational and technical educa-,55
NA,tion. I think we have had more in the last,55
NA,week and a half than we have had in the pre-,55
NA,vious 8½ years.,55
NA,Health: Services,55
Dr WASHER ,3.07 p.m.)-My question,55
NA,is addressed to the Minister for Health and,55
NA,Ageing. Would the minister update the,55
NA,House on how new technology is helping,55
NA,deliver better health care to Australians?,55
Mr ABBOTT,I thank the member for,55
NA,Moore for his question and I congratulate,55
NA,him on increasing his margin from six per,55
NA,cent to a very healthy 10.8 per cent-,55
NA,Honourable members interjecting-,55
Mr ABBOTT,as many members oppo-,55
NA,site have done in the recent election. It is a,55
NA,fact that the most comprehensive major,55
NA,study of avoidable deaths in Australian,55
NA,health institutions suggested that 20 per cent,55
NA,of these were due to poor information or in-,55
NA,adequate record keeping. So an integrated,55
NA,electronic health record should mean better,55
NA,care for patients and it should mean lower,55
NA,costs to taxpayers and to consumers. It,55
NA,should mean less need for patients to keep,55
NA,records and to carry information around with,55
NA,them. It should mean fewer expensive and,55
NA,invasive diagnostic tests. It should mean less,56
NA,overservicing and it should mean less misuse,56
NA,of prescription drugs.,56
NA,Just about all the computers on all the,56
NA,health professionals' desks right around our,56
NA,country are already linked via the Internet.,56
NA,The challenge is to try to create a secure,56
NA,tabase with secure transmissions so that pa-,56
NA,tients and health professionals can access,56
NA,information they need precisely when they,56
NA,"need it. In the last budget, the government",56
NA,committed $128 million to prepare for a na-,56
NA,"tional HealthConnect roll-out. In Tasmania,",56
NA,they have just concluded a trial which has,56
NA,proven the technology and helped to demon-,56
NA,strate the business case. I can inform the,56
NA,member for Moore and the House that the,56
NA,Commonwealth and the states have just es-,56
NA,tablished a National E-Health Transition Au-,56
NA,thority with the task of trying to ensure that,56
NA,health records move out of the horse-and-,56
NA,buggy era. We have to ensure that our health,56
NA,"record system, no less than our medical",56
NA,"treatment, remains the very best in the world.",56
NA,Education: Vocational Education and,56
NA,Training,56
Mr BURKE ,3.10 p.m.)-My question is,56
NA,to the Minister for Vocational and Technical,56
NA,Education. Is the minister aware that the,56
NA,Western Australian Master Builders Associa-,56
NA,tion has forecast a 10 per cent price hike in,56
NA,the cost of building or renovating a house,56
NA,because of the shortage of skilled labour and,56
NA,the increased cost of materials like bricks?,56
NA,Doesn't this mean that Australian families,56
NA,and businesses who are building or renovat-,56
NA,ing are being forced to pay the price for the,56
NA,Howard government's lack of action on Aus-,56
NA,tralia's skills crisis? Don't Australian busiwas,56
NA,nesses and families need action from the,56
NA,"Howard government on skills now, not in",56
NA,another four years when the government's,56
NA,overdue and insufficient technical colleges,56
NA,will finally be fully in place?,56
Mr COSTELLO,I will take that ques-,56
NA,tion on housing costs and thank the honour-,56
NA,able member very much for his question. It is,56
NA,"true that, because unemployment is low in",56
NA,"Australia, in some areas there are shortages",56
NA,of skilled labour. That can be looked at as a,56
NA,dabad thing in an economy or it can be looked,56
NA,"at as a very positive thing, frankly. If we had",56
NA,the our choice between an oversupply of labour,56
NA,"or a shortage of labour, we would probably",56
NA,take a shortage of labour because what that,56
NA,indicates is that people can find work.,56
NA,Australia was not actually suffering from,56
NA,any skills shortages or any shortages of la-,56
NA,bour during the Labor Party's term in gov-,56
NA,ernment when we had 11 per cent unem-,56
NA,"ployment. But, having said that, if you want",56
NA,to ensure that there are no bottlenecks in an,56
NA,economy it is important that you continue to,56
NA,supply skilled labour lest you get price pres-,56
NA,sures in those areas. That brings into play,56
NA,two issues. One is this government's immi-,56
NA,"gration program, which has been refocused",56
NA,on skilled immigration very deliberately. It,56
NA,contrasts with the Australian Labor Party's,56
NA,"program, which was focused on family reun-",56
NA,ion. Second is the program that this govern-,56
NA,ment announced to set up Australian techni-,56
NA,cal colleges.,56
NA,"We announced that because, as the Prime",56
NA,Minister said over and over again during the,56
NA,"election campaign, we want a system where",56
NA,Australian young people and their parents,56
NA,value a trade certificate as much as a univer-,56
NA,sity degree. The idea which was developed,56
NA,for a good period during the 1980s and,56
NA,1990s that every child should go to univer-,56
NA,sity was not serving our community well. It,56
NA,not in their interests and it was not in the,56
NA,interests of the economy. This government is,56
NA,ensuring that there are additional technical,56
NA,and trade training areas. We are stepping in,56
NA,where there has been a failure by the states,56
NA,and we are ensuring that there will be a,56
NA,strong labour market. We will make sure that,56
NA,demand is still strong because demand in the,57
NA,housing market has been a big part of Aus-,57
NA,tralia's success story and its recent economic,57
NA,growth over the last eight years.,57
NA,Superannuation: Policy,57
Mr BALDWIN ,3.13 p.m.)-My ques-,57
NA,tion is addressed to the Minister for Revenue,57
NA,and Assistant Treasurer. Would the minister,57
NA,advise the House of the extent to which Aus-,57
NA,tralians are accessing the government's su-,57
NA,perannuation co-contribution scheme?,57
Mr BROUGH,I thank the member for,57
NA,Paterson for his question. I am pleased to,57
NA,inform the House that the ATO has informed,57
NA,me that they are about to roll out the first,57
NA,tranche of payments of the Howard govern-,57
NA,ment's co-contribution scheme. They have,57
NA,recently checked 1.25 million income tax,57
NA,returns for their eligibility for the co-,57
NA,"contribution. Of that 1.25 million, I am",57
NA,pleased to inform the House that some,57
NA,"215,000 middleand low-income earners",57
NA,will be receiving a co-contribution towards,57
NA,their retirement income.,57
NA,This is particularly good news because it,57
NA,"is not only doing something positive today,",57
NA,but it is also giving an incentive to Austra-,57
NA,lians to make provision for their retirement,57
NA,in years to come. The tax office estimates,57
NA,that $110 million will be injected into Aus-,57
NA,tralia's superannuation as a result of these,57
NA,"payments, which is an average of about $510",57
NA,per payment per person. To put this into the,57
NA,"context, with this extra payment, a person on",57
NA,"$28,000 over a 30-year working life will in-",57
NA,crease their retirement balance by about,57
NA,"$54,000 or potentially about $2,300 extra",57
NA,"income in retirement, which is a great thing",57
NA,for Australians to look forward to.,57
NA,This morning I noticed in the Australian,57
NA,Financial Review that one of Australia's,57
NA,"largest industry funds, the Australian Retire-",57
NA,"ment Fund, is planning a promotion in which",57
NA,one of its members describes the co-,57
NA,contribution as ‘bloody brilliant'. Quite,57
NA,"frankly, I am sure the 215,000 Australians",57
NA,out there who are about to receive extra,57
NA,money through the Howard government's,57
NA,co-contribution would agree with the senti-,57
NA,ment that this is ‘bloody brilliant'. It means,57
NA,that Australians are being provided an incen-,57

NA,Education: Vocational Education and,57
NA,Training,57
Ms MACKLIN ,3.16 p.m.)-My ques-,57
NA,tion is again to the Minister for Vocational,57
NA,and Technical Education. Is the minister,57
NA,aware that skills growth as a driver of pro-,57
NA,ductivity has plummeted 75 per cent in the,57
NA,last 10 years and that Australia now has a,57
NA,severe skills shortage in key trades and in-,57
NA,dustries? Isn't it true that under the Howard,57
NA,"government around 40,000 Australians have",57
NA,"been turned away from TAFE each year, in-",57
NA,"cluding 15,000 young people, and that the",57
NA,vast majority of secondary school students,57
NA,will miss out on a technical college place?,57
NA,"Minister, isn't Australia's skills crisis a direct",57
NA,result of the Howard government's failure to,57
NA,create enough training opportunities and,57
NA,boost Australia's skill levels?,57
Mr HARDGRAVE,The member for,57
NA,Jagajaga has discovered the trades! The,57
NA,workers' party have discovered the trade,57
NA,skills that underpin Australia's economy!,57
NA,What is true is that in 1995 an estimated,57
NA,"89,300 individuals applied for but were un-",57
NA,able to get a place to study in a vocational,57
NA,"education training course. Of those, 69,400",57
NA,were seeking access to a TAFE place. In,57
NA,"1999 the level was 71,100-it had fallen-",57
NA,"and 53,900 were seeking a TAFE place. In",57
NA,"2003 the level had fallen to 55,400, of whom",57
NA,"45,900 were seeking a TAFE place.",57
NA,In the face of state governments lifting,57
NA,"TAFE fees, in the face of a decade or more",57
NA,"of neglect from those opposite, this govern-",58
NA,ment has deliberately turned around the im-,58
NA,portance of training apprentices and people,58
NA,in traineeships. This government has made,58
NA,"an enormous difference: from 141,000 peo-",58
NA,ple involved in vocational education and,58
NA,"training, as apprentices and trainees, to",58
NA,"400,000. That is a fundamental change. Now",58
NA,let us look at it in dollar terms. The Austra-,58
NA,lian government's contribution to states and,58
NA,territories has grown from $777.9 million,58
NA,"under Labor to $1.13 billion. In fact, there is",58
NA,"legislation that drives that up, indexing the",58
NA,base to $1.154 billion under this government.,58
NA,That is an increase of over 45 per cent.,58
NA,Those statistics speak for which side of,58
NA,politics is focusing on the trades skills,58
NA,"age, and has done for almost a decade, com-",58
NA,pared to those who neglected it for over a,58
NA,decade. Those figures underscore the fact,58
NA,that this side of Australian politics under-,58
NA,stands very clearly the way to guarantee on-,58
NA,going growth on top of the already tremen-,58
NA,dous growth that we have. The Treasurer has,58
NA,outlined the enormous way in which this,58
NA,economy is demanding more and more peo-,58
NA,ple with more and more skills. This govern-,58
NA,ment is addressing that.,58
NA,"There is one last point, and this is where",58
NA,those opposite have got the biggest problem,58
NA,"of all. All members on this side know it, but",58
NA,those opposite still have not cottoned onto it.,58
NA,On this side of the chamber we are not afraid,58
NA,of the Australian workers driving up their,58
NA,wages based on the productivity they are,58
NA,achieving. We are not afraid of the Australian,58
NA,workers gaining an additional dividend in,58
NA,their pay packet because of the skills they,58

Mr ALBANESE,I do.,58
The SPEAKER,Please proceed.,58
Mr ALBANESE,Yesterday on the In-,58
NA,siders program Michael O'Connor of the,58
NA,forestry division of the CFMEU stated that I,58
NA,called members of his union ‘vandals' during,58
NA,an interview on the AM program. This is not,58
NA,true. I have respect for all workers and have,59
NA,never criticised workers for doing the job,59
NA,they are paid to do. Companies and politi-,59

Mr WINDSOR ,New England) (3.21,59

The SPEAKER,Does the honourable,59
NA,member claim to have been misrepresented?,59
Mr WINDSOR,"Yes, I do.",59
The SPEAKER,Please proceed.,59
Mr WINDSOR,Before making the per-,59
NA,"sonal explanation, I would like to concur",59
NA,with the comments of the member for Page.,59
NA,That photograph was taken when he was,59
NA,talking to me about the health of the Hon.,59
NA,Bob Katter before question time. In question,59
NA,"time on 18 November 2004, in answer to a",59
NA,question from the Leader of the Opposition,59
NA,to the Deputy Prime Minister about com-,59
NA,ments made to me in a conversation with me,59
NA,in this House relating to his contact with Mr,59
NA,"Greg Maguire, the Deputy Prime Minister",59
NA,misrepresented this conversation. He said:,59
NA,"Yes, I was walking out of this place-I think it",59
NA,was probably during June ... and on the way out,59
NA,he-,59
NA,meaning me-,59
NA,"motioned me over and said, ‘I understand you",59
NA,might want to talk to me.',59
NA,The Deputy Prime Minister's version of his,59
NA,response was:,59
NA,‘No. What? I don't know anything about it.' I,59
NA,have no understanding whatsoever as to why he,59
NA,thought I might want to talk to him about it. I,59
NA,don't. I said to him: ‘No. If I want to talk to you,59
NA,"at some point in the future, I'll get in contact.'",59
NA,Those are the words that the Deputy Prime,59
NA,Minister misrepresented in this House last,59
NA,week. This is a misrepresentation of that,59
NA,conversation.,59
The SPEAKER,Order! The honourable,59
NA,member has explained where he has been,59
NA,misrepresented.,59
Mr WINDSOR,"No, I have not. My rec-",59
NA,ollection of that conversation was that I said:,59
NA,"‘John, I understand you want to talk to me.",59
NA,People are saying in Tamworth that you are,59
NA,saying I won't talk to you. I'm more than,59
NA,happy to talk to you at any time.' Mr Ander-,59
NA,"son then said, ‘You mean my meeting with",59
NA,"Mr Maguire,' to which I said, ‘Not only Greg",59
NA,Maguire but others in the community.' This,59
NA,is a correct account of that conversation.,59

NA,to the attention of the House:,64
NA,"- That under proposed changes to Medicare,",64

NA,"will miss out on bulk billing, and doctors",64
NA,will increase their fees for visits that are no,64
NA,longer bulk billed;,64
NA,- That the rate of bulk billing by GPs has,64
NA,plummeted by 11% under John Howard;,64
NA,- That more than 10 million fewer GP visits,65
NA,were bulk billed this year compared to when,65
NA,John Howard came to office;,65
NA,- That the average out-of-pocket cost to see a,65
NA,GP who does not bulk bill has gone up by,65
NA,55% since 1996 to $12.78 today;,65
NA,- That public hospitals are now under greater,65
NA,pressure because people are finding it harder,65
NA,to see bulk billing doctors.,65
NA,We therefore pray that the House takes urgent,65

NA,make no income from either property.,67

NA,which unreasonably includes the holiday,67
NA,"home, motor vehicle and furniture in the",67

NA,Two and subsequently in such other emergency,68
NA,situations as the Commonwealth has been in-,68
NA,"volved we, like our predecessors, have at all times",68
NA,been prepared to serve wherever we were placed,68
NA,by the military and political authorities. Among,68
NA,us we include some who were incarcerated by the,68
NA,enemy through no fault of their own. Indeed a,68
NA,"large number were surrendered by their superiors,",68
NA,"in theatres such as Singapore, Crete and Greece.",68
NA,The people of Australia can conclude only from,68
NA,the attitude and actions of the Australian Gov-,68
NA,ernment at the time and subsequently that those,68
NA,who were taken as prisoners of war are regarded,68
NA,"as the ‘forgotten ones', even though many of",68
NA,them suffered far greater privations for a longer,68
NA,period than many who continued to serve in ac-,68
NA,tive combat roles. That the Commonwealth Gov-,68
NA,ernment has been reluctant to acknowledge the,68
NA,role these servicemen and women have played is,68
NA,all too evident. No register was kept at the time of,68
NA,those so incarcerated and indeed even today there,68
NA,remain many who are unidentified. Whilst it is,68
NA,right and proper that those who died in the service,68
NA,"of their country should be commemorated, we are",68
NA,convinced that similar recognition should be af-,68
NA,forded to those who went through a living hell as,68
NA,prisoners of war.,68
NA,To this end a Prisoners of War Memorial has now,68
NA,"been erected in Ballarat, funded largely by public",68
NA,"subscription, on which are permanently recorded",68
NA,the names of prisoners of war from throughout,68
NA,Australia who served their country in all wars,68
NA,from the formation of the Commonwealth up to,68
NA,the present. Thus the people of Australia have,68
NA,seen fit to recognise the role these men women,68
NA,"played in wartime, even though successive Gov-",68
NA,ernments appear to have been embarrassed by,68
NA,their existence.,68
NA,Whilst recognising that the Commonwealth Gov-,68
NA,ernment has made a modest contribution to this,68
NA,of Memorial the amount palls into insignificance,68
NA,when compared with how much has been spent,68
NA,on other memorials both in Australia and over-,68
NA,seas.,68
NA,"Your petitioners, the undersigned, therefore ask",68
NA,that the House demonstrate its recognition of the,68
NA,role these servicemen and servicewomen played,68
NA,in Australia's history by Gazetting the Prisoners,68

NA,GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH,71
NA,Address-in-Reply,71
NA,Debate resumed.,71
Mr CADMAN ,Mitchell) (3.31 p.m.)-,71
NA,Few people in Australia would not acknowl-,71
NA,edge that the basis of the confidence that this,71
NA,country has experienced has been laid down,71
NA,by the government's building on the eco-,71
NA,nomic base that inspires confidence and,71
NA,commitment to growth and future investment,71
NA,in Australia. The three per cent to four per,71
NA,cent growth over the last few years has been,71
NA,the basis of that confidence. That was the,71
NA,nub-the crux-of the last election. From,71
NA,the day the election was called the electors,71
NA,"were asking, ‘Can we maintain our confi-",71
NA,dence in light of the proposals put by both,71
NA,the coalition and the Labor Party?' They,71
NA,looked at the certainty they were experienc-,71
NA,ing with interest rates and high levels of em-,71
NA,ployment and with the capacity to invest and,71
NA,make decisions with certainty. They com-,71
NA,pared that with the proposals being put for-,71
NA,ward by the Australian Labor Party.,71
NA,The coalition had built on the lack of con-,71
NA,fidence that brought about the change of,71
NA,government in 1996 with a plan for doing,71
NA,something about the massive debt that the,71
NA,Labor Party had run up. The coalition came,71
NA,into office with a plan to reduce taxation and,71
NA,give back to Australian citizens more of their,71
NA,own hard-won savings. The coalition came,71
NA,into office with a plan so that Australia could,71
NA,be competitive and take up a role of chal-,71
NA,lenging those in the world who want to com-,71
NA,pete against us in our markets and also ex-,71
NA,pand local businesses so that export re-,71
NA,placement could take place purely by being,71
NA,more competitive. The coalition came to of-,71
NA,fice with the promise and commitment to,71
NA,"quite reward effort and increase productivity, and",71
NA,that was carried out. Those were the key fac-,71
NA,tors that were evident from the day the last,71
NA,"election was called. Growth, more jobs, fal-",71
NA,"ling unemployment, an increase in real",71
NA,"wages, low cost of living increases and low",71
NA,interest rates were all part of those factors.,71
NA,We came through a number of problems.,71
NA,The economic downturn in Asia was a chal-,71
NA,lenge for us to overcome. The worldwide,71
NA,terrorism that confronts us all and is with us,71
NA,"today could have been a stalling factor, and it",71
NA,broke the confidence of countries with less,71
NA,confidence in the future than Australia. The,71
NA,change in climatic circumstances brought,71
NA,"real issues of concern to rural communities,",71
NA,as did a downturn in our export earnings,71
NA,from rural produce. The longer term impact,71
NA,of an ageing population with a work force,71
NA,maintained at about the current level but a,71
NA,need to expand our production and output is,71
NA,a longer term issue that is confronting us and,71
NA,is being dealt with by the government.,71
NA,The confidence of Australians that the,71
NA,coalition could handle the circumstances and,71
NA,had a track record that indicated that they,71
NA,could do that was compared with a whole list,71
NA,of ideas that came forward from the Labor,71
NA,Party. The coalition's ideas to provide a ma-,71
NA,ture age worker tax offset to make it more,71
NA,financially attractive for older Australians to,71
NA,"remain in employment on a full-time, part-",71
NA,time or casual basis was one idea presented,71
NA,at the election. The government's announced,71
NA,tax cuts would provide 80 per cent of tax-,71
NA,payers with a marginal tax rate of no more,71
NA,than 30 per cent. It was said that legislation,71
NA,would be introduced to give formal recogni-,71
NA,tion and protection to independent contrac-,71
NA,tors-the single contractors in building and,71
NA,transport and other industries who are the,71
NA,real generators of economic activity and pro-,71
NA,duction in our community. The meeting of,71
NA,the skills needs of our community by invest-,71
NA,ing more in better quality tertiary and further,71
NA,education and the capacity and commitment,72
NA,to build 24 Australian technical colleges ca-,72
NA,"tering for year 11 and year 12 students,",72
NA,"thereby lifting the skills base of Australia,",72
NA,were part of the attractive features that were,72
NA,acknowledged by Australians coming into,72
NA,"the election. Working with parents, the gov-",72
NA,ernment will invest directly in school infra-,72
NA,structure through an additional $1 billion,72
NA,"commitment over the next four years, work-",72
NA,ing directly with schools and parents to in-,72
NA,vest in education to help address the short-,72
NA,falls that many state governments have failed,72
NA,to rectify in their own education programs.,72
NA,This was compared by electors to a whole,72
NA,range of ideas that started to emerge in De-,72
NA,cember 2003. It was not better highlighted,72
NA,anywhere than in the Australian Financial,72
NA,"Review, in an article on economics by David",72
NA,"Bassanese. In his article, David Bassanese",72
NA,recounted some of the ideas that were com-,72
NA,ing forward from the Leader of the Opposi-,72
NA,tion at that time-and that were carried,72
NA,through into the election campaign. They,72
NA,created an air of confusion and uncertainty,72
NA,"that, when balanced against the confidence",72
NA,the community had in the coalition govern-,72
NA,"ment's management, forced the community",72
NA,to vote in a massive way for the coalition,72
NA,rather than for the ALP. That theme stayed,72
NA,with the electors right through the campaign.,72
NA,Although many listened very carefully to,72
NA,"what the Leader of the Opposition said, he",72
NA,could not assure them that they should have,72
NA,the confidence to change their vote.,72
NA,Some of the ideas that came forward,72
NA,around 12 months ago were really interest-,72
NA,"ing, but they were such a mishmash that they",72
NA,caused Access Economics director Chris,72
NA,Richardson to say about the Leader of the,72
NA,Opposition:,72
NA,He is an ideas man ... But ... too many ideas,72
NA,mean too many risks.,72
NA,I think that that probably proved to be right.,72
NA,"Some of the ideas, which amounted to $6.5",72
NA,"billion of spending over four years, included",72
NA,"changes to the baby bonus, changes to etha-",72
NA,nol subsidies and cutting fuel subsidies.,72
NA,Things that people had acknowledged as be-,72
NA,ing important were played around with and,72
NA,then funds were redirected elsewhere. Fa-,72
NA,vouring tax cuts for those earning more than,72
NA,"$80,000 a year did not seem consistent with",72
NA,Labor Party philosophy. The speedy release,72
NA,of federal land when demand is high was an,72
NA,"interesting concept, but the federal govern-",72
NA,ment holds little land compared with what is,72
NA,"held by state governments. After all, the state",72
NA,government planning provisions would over-,72
NA,ride any federal government decisions in that,72
NA,area.,72
NA,The tweaking of immigration policy to,72
NA,boost incentives for migrants to settle outside,72
NA,Sydney was an interesting idea. It has never,72
NA,worked anywhere in the world and would not,72
NA,work here either. Other ideas were: to reduce,72
NA,"the superannuation contributions tax, to pro-",72
NA,vide incentives for employee share owner-,72
NA,ship and to provide matched savings ac-,72
NA,counts for low-income earners. If you are not,72
NA,"earning much money, you do not have much",72
NA,to put into a savings account anyway. I do,72
NA,not know quite how that would work. An-,72
NA,other idea was the beefing up of the Trade,72
NA,Practices Act.,72
NA,It was a mishmash of ideas that did not in-,72
NA,"spire confidence, as compared with a steady",72
NA,program of confidence building that had,72
NA,been initiated by the coalition from the be-,72
NA,ginning of our term in office in 1996. On this,72
NA,side of the House we have worked consis-,72
NA,"tently to build that confidence, to make sure",72
NA,"that the entrepreneurs, the small businesses",72
NA,and the families of Australia have the confi-,72
NA,may dence to make decisions and invest in the,72
NA,"future, in their businesses, in their families,",72
NA,in their homes and in their neighbourhoods.,72
NA,So the confidence in the government that had,72
NA,been built up over that period of time was,73
NA,reinforced by a confused presentation from,73
NA,the Australian Labor Party.,73
NA,This is no more obvious than in the area,73
NA,"of industrial relations, where productivity",73
NA,and real wages have risen massively under,73
NA,this government. That compares with a two,73
NA,per cent rise in real wages over a period of,73
NA,"13 years under Labor and, generally, a very",73
NA,disheartened labour force which was more,73
NA,prone to strike and less happy with its em-,73
NA,ployment prospects than has been the experi-,73
NA,ence under this government. The Australian,73
NA,"Bureau of Statistics, in national accounts",73
NA,"released in August 2004, showed that labour",73
NA,productivity grew by 3.8 per cent in the last,73
NA,financial year. That is the largest increase,73
NA,productivity since the 4.3 per cent growth in,73
NA,productivity in 1998. That just gives an idea,73
NA,of the trend-people working not harder but,73
NA,smarter and gaining better rewards for their,73
NA,efforts. Encouraging that attitude in the,73
NA,community has been a theme for this gov-,73
NA,ernment. This is not a heavy-handed gov-,73
NA,ernment but a light hand encouraging people,73
NA,in their workplace. That has borne fruit and,73
NA,has brought with it the confidence of growth,73
NA,and the confidence to re-elect the current,73
NA,government.,73
NA,"The building industry, in particular, has",73
NA,been the focus of economic and industrial,73
NA,relations reform. The Cole royal commission,73
NA,points to a number of areas where more re-,73
NA,form is needed. This government intends to,73
NA,go further in one area which I want to indi-,73
NA,cate as being significant. It is estimated,73
NA,if the same sorts of practices and productiv-,73
NA,ity could be applied to commercial construc-,73
NA,tion as apply to residential construction,73
NA,would be a 25 per cent equivalent better out-,73
NA,come in commercial construction. The Cole,73
NA,"royal commission identified shortcomings,",73
NA,and it is this government's intention to move,73
NA,ahead and make further changes to both un-,73
NA,fair dismissal and the area of independent,73
NA,contractors.,73
NA,A survey conducted by the University of,73
NA,Melbourne in 2002 found that the cost of,73
NA,state and federal unfair dismissal laws to,73
NA,small and medium business is about $1.3,73
NA,billion annually. It estimates the cost of the,73
NA,"unfair dismissal process, both state and fed-",73
NA,"eral, to be about 77,000 jobs. So we have the",73
NA,"prospect of increasing the employment rate,",73
NA,"reducing unemployment by 77,000, through",73
NA,"a simple change, not a harsh change. Note",73
NA,"that this is not a harsh process, because the",73
NA,20 notifiable processes that are cemented in,73
NA,legislation will remain there. They will not,73
NA,be taken out. It is the extraneous stuff that,73
NA,in makes it really hard for a small employer to,73
NA,"get rid of somebody who is not performing,",73
NA,for fear of an unfair dismissal claim often,73
NA,"running in the range of $10,000 to $20,000-",73
NA,something that small business cannot con-,73
NA,template and cannot take a risk on.,73
NA,"More recently, the Sensis business index",73
NA,survey found that 28 per cent of small and,73
NA,medium businesses had decided not to take,73
NA,on additional employees because of the pos-,73
NA,sibility of unfair dismissal action. The survey,73
NA,proved that this is a continuing concern for,73
NA,small businesses in the building industry.,73
NA,The independent contractors act will be initi-,73
NA,ated after consultation with contractors.,73
NA,These are independent contractors who like,73
NA,the freedom to choose the working arrange-,73
NA,ments that suit them best. They do not want,73
NA,to be under the CFMEU. They want the free-,73
NA,that dom to make their own decisions about their,73
NA,hours and conditions of work. They do not,73
NA,want to be roped in by an aggressive union.,73
NA,there They do not want to be deemed employees.,73
NA,They want the freedoms that have been the,73
NA,very strength of the Australian residential,73
NA,construction industry-a strength that needs,73
NA,to be extended.,73
NA,The other area in which I think the par-,74
NA,liament needs to give some lead is in relation,74
NA,to urban water supply. I do not think there is,74
NA,a state government that is really tackling this,74
NA,issue in an effective way. I know it is not the,74
NA,Commonwealth's constitutional responsibil-,74
NA,ity to supply water to the cities of Australia,74
NA,"but, of all organisations, the CSIRO seems to",74
NA,have done the most work to identify the dif-,74
NA,ficulties and propose solutions. Dr Grace,74
NA,Mitchell in a recent address in Canberra out-,74
NA,lined a wide range of proven processes that,74
NA,can be beneficial in retaining water for reuse,74
NA,and for further conserving water on site. Dr,74
NA,Grace Mitchell said:,74
NA,Australia's self-sufficient suburb would have no,74
NA,"potable water piped to homes and factories, and",74
NA,"all residential, commercial and industrial waste",74
NA,"water would be collected, treated",74
NA,a local waste water treatment plant.,74
NA,"This is feasible, but it does sound radical.",74
NA,"Within the Sydney region, stormwater from",74
NA,blocks of units and households is trapped,74
NA,"but, in fact, none of that water is used on",74
NA,gardens or for domestic purposes. It is sent,74
NA,down the drain and out into the Pacific,74
NA,Ocean. It seems a shocking waste. I know,74
NA,that many within the nursery and building,74
NA,"industries, as well as the residents of Sydney,",74
NA,think that Bob Carr's policy of ‘get used to,74
NA,it' is not good enough. (Time expired),74
Mr LATHAM ,Werriwa-Leader of the,74
NA,Opposition) (3.47 p.m.)-On this day 150,74
NA,"years ago more than 10,000 miners gathered",74
NA,on the Bakery Hill in Ballarat to protest their,74
NA,rights and demand democracy. At this meet-,74
NA,"ing, the Southern Cross flag was unfurled for",74
NA,"the first time, its dramatic design inspiring",74
NA,the miners to burn their licences and con-,74
NA,tinue their campaign against unfair taxation,74
NA,and the unfair use of colonial power. The,74
NA,"next day, Peter Lawler led a group of miners",74
NA,"to Eureka, where they built their stockade.",74
NA,"Three days later, on 3 December, the troops",74
NA,attacked and the battle of Eureka was fought,74
NA,out-one of the most important events and,74
NA,legends in the history of our country. We,74
NA,should not let this parliamentary week pass,74
NA,without honouring the significance of,74
NA,Eureka. It says so much about the Australian,74
NA,character and identity: our love of the under-,74
NA,dog and support for those who have a go; our,74
NA,"willingness to stand up for our rights, to not",74
NA,buckle in the face of authority; our tradition,74
NA,"of defiance, dissent and the larrikin spirit that",74
NA,makes us truly Australian. This is why,74
NA,Eureka is often described as the birthplace of,74
NA,"Australian democracy, where we learn the",74
NA,importance of human rights and the great,74
NA,values of a free society; that individuals,74
NA,"should be able to express themselves freely,",74
NA,to protest and mobilise politically without,74
NA,being punished by the oppressive power of,74
NA,and recycled by the state.,74
NA,Can I just say how glad I am that the spirit,74
NA,of the Eureka rebellion is alive in the cham-,74
NA,"ber today, with so many of the preselectors",74
NA,of Wentworth here to listen to the parliamen-,74
NA,tary debates. The spirit of rebellion was free,74
NA,in their own preselection decisions when,74
NA,"they sent Peter King away, burning his min-",74
NA,"ers licence, and stood up for their rights to",74
NA,"preselect a new member for Wentworth, from",74
NA,whom we are about to hear for the first time.,74
NA,An incident having occurred in the gal-,74
NA,lery-,74
The DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Jen-,74
NA,kins)-The gallery should come to order!,74
Mr LATHAM,I welcome their applause,74
NA,because never have so many people from,74
NA,Vaucluse travelled so far to also listen to me,74
NA,in the parliamentary forum.,74
NA,An incident having occurred in the gal-,74
NA,lery-,74
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,The Leader,74
NA,of the Opposition should be neither dis-,74
NA,tracted nor overly encouraged by the gallery.,74
Mr LATHAM,I am reminded of the,75
NA,"great words of John Lennon. Perhaps, in-",75
NA,"stead of applause, they could just jangle their",75
NA,jewellery and make their noise known,75
NA,"around the chamber. Mr Speaker, they are",75
NA,"not well amused, but I hope they enjoy the",75
NA,following speech.,75
NA,Eureka also established the great Austra-,75
NA,lian tradition of social diversity. Only two of,75
NA,the miners were said to be Australian born;,75
NA,"others came from lands like California, Ire-",75
NA,"land, Italy, Germany, Jamaica, China and, of",75
NA,"course, Britain. In its diversity, its spirit",75
NA,"its egalitarianism, this was the first multicul-",75
NA,"tural community in Australia and, despite the",75
NA,"violence of the stockade, it worked. It",75
NA,worked in its rich ethnic background and,75
NA,sense of common purpose.,75
NA,This was the vision proclaimed on the,75
NA,Bakery Hill by the Italian rebel leader Raf-,75
NA,"faelo Carboni, who called on the miners-",75
NA,"irrespective of nationality, religion and col-",75
NA,our-to salute the Southern Cross as the ref-,75
NA,uge of all the oppressed from all the coun-,75
NA,tries of the earth. It was a community of fair-,75
NA,"ness, a community of nations. The miners of",75
NA,course had diverse backgrounds as trades-,75
NA,"men, lawyers, doctors, sailors, farmers and",75
NA,mechanics. History tells us there was even a,75
NA,"politician present at Eureka, the President of",75
NA,"Victoria's Legislative Council, Sir John",75
NA,"Palmer-not the first politician, of course, to",75
NA,have gone digging for gold nor the last. I will,75
NA,refrain from the obvious comment about the,75
NA,next speaker. It is a terrible shame that,75
NA,cians in the Howard government are not par-,75
NA,ticipating in the first sesquicentenary cele-,75
NA,bration of Eureka in Ballarat. The celebration,75
NA,"is to be held this week, and of course the",75
NA,celebrations started last week. I congratulate,75
NA,"the Victorian government, the Ballarat Coun-",75
NA,cil and also the member for Ballarat for par-,75
NA,ticipating in and organising such a great,75
NA,round of celebrations.,75
NA,The Prime Minister obviously sees this as,75
NA,a Labor style celebration. But no one party,75
NA,has a final claim on Eureka. It is a political,75
NA,event that can be embraced by different parts,75
NA,of the spectrum. A campaign against high,75
NA,taxes and the oppressive power of the state,75
NA,are not uncommon themes for right of centre,75
NA,"parties around the world, so why is it that the",75
NA,Prime Minister has effectively placed a boy-,75
NA,"cott on the Eureka celebrations? In fact, one",75
NA,of his predecessors at the time of the centen-,75
NA,"ary of Eureka, in 1954, Prime Minister Men-",75
NA,"and zies, who in fact went to school in Ballarat,",75
NA,described Eureka as a movement for the,75
NA,proper control of public finances. He would,75
NA,"say that, of course. On our side of politics,",75
NA,"the left of centre, we take inspiration from",75
NA,"the struggle of the workers, the great nation-",75
NA,"alism, the great patriotism of the movement",75
NA,"and, of course, the struggle for democracy",75
NA,and human rights. So I say we should all,75
NA,share in the celebration of the Eureka spirit.,75
NA,"As Australians, as patriots, we should all",75
NA,have the maturity and confidence in our own,75
NA,views and values to embrace the legend of,75
NA,Eureka.,75
NA,It is regrettable that the Prime Minister,75
NA,has refused to fly the flag above Parliament,75
NA,House and has rejected the member for Bal-,75
NA,larat's private members bill to give the,75
NA,"Eureka flag official status. However, like the",75
NA,"miners, we struggle on. I congratulate the",75
NA,state and local government authorities who,75
NA,will be flying the flag and the members of,75
NA,politiparliament who will display it in various,75
NA,"parts of the building. We, too, shall salute the",75
NA,Southern Cross. This boycott of Eureka high-,75
NA,lights one of the great flaws in the Howard,75
NA,government: its meanness and its divisive-,75
NA,ness-in this case expressed through its ig-,75
NA,norance of Australian political history. The,75
NA,Prime Minister is often fond of saying that,75
NA,the things that unite us as Australians are,75
NA,more important than things that divide us.,75
NA,"Well, surely one of the things that unite the",75
NA,"nation is our love of Australian history, our",76
NA,"love of Australian culture and heritage, our",76
NA,love of the Eureka legend. It should have,76
NA,been celebrated by all the parties in this,76
NA,place. We should all have been represented,76
NA,to share in the historical significance of that,76
NA,great event. But this is the meanness and,76
NA,divisiveness of the Howard government.,76
NA,This leads me to the second theme in this,76
NA,response to the address of the Governor-,76
NA,General: the government's neglect of the,76
NA,"education, training and skills development",76
NA,agenda-an area of meanness in the alloca-,76
NA,tion of public investment that is costing Aus-,76
NA,"tralia dearly. In fact, this great debate about",76
NA,"education, training and skill development is",76
NA,one of the longest-running debates in the,76
NA,history of the Howard government. Labor,76
NA,made the point in 1996 that the government,76
NA,was setting down a path of underinvestment,76
NA,in the basic skills of the Australian people.,76
NA,The biggest cut in the first budget of the,76
NA,Howard-Costello government was to educa-,76
NA,tion. Their biggest and harshest cut in that,76
NA,first budget was to education and training,76
NA,investments. We warned then of the folly of,76
NA,underinvesting in the skills of the Australian,76
NA,people. The government's decision-the,76
NA,eightor nine-year underinvestment in the,76
NA,skills of the Australian people-defies the,76
NA,logic and the true meaning of the new econ-,76
NA,omy.,76
NA,"The basic message heard by economists,",76
NA,financial experts and indeed workers right,76
NA,around the world is that jobs based on mus-,76
NA,cle and machine power are disappearing; the,76
NA,jobs of the future are coming from brain,76
NA,power. The best investment a nation can,76
NA,make in its future is to invest heavily in the,76
NA,skills and capabilities of its people. The,76
NA,greatest mistake of the Howard government,76
NA,has been to ignore that lesson and underin-,76
NA,"vest over eight or nine years. Of course, we",76
NA,are now seeing the critical skills shortage in,76
NA,Australia damaging our prospects for future,76
NA,prosperity. It gives the Labor Party no joy in,76
NA,pointing out this historic error-the failure of,76
NA,the government over a long period of time to,76
NA,invest properly in skills-and now the skills,76
NA,shortage is one of the greatest threats to our,76
NA,long-term prosperity as a nation. It is leading,76
NA,"to capacity constraints, putting pressure on",76
NA,"businesses and, of course, putting upward",76
NA,pressure on interest rates.,76
NA,Let me just give the House some of the,76
NA,key figures. I welcome the fact that the min-,76
NA,"ister is at the table. Earlier, in question time,",76
NA,he was trying to deny these basic realities.,76
NA,"Skills growth, as a driver of productivity in",76
NA,"Australia, has dropped 75 per cent in the last",76
NA,10 years-that is a Productivity Commission,76
NA,"statistic. The Australian Industry Group, in",76
NA,"its submission to the Senate skills inquiry,",76
NA,reported that over half of the businesses sur-,76
NA,veyed face skills shortages in this country.,76
NA,Surely a government that cares about busi-,76
NA,ness capacity and economic expansion would,76
NA,be moving quickly to address this skills,76
NA,"shortage, especially given its failure over the",76
NA,past eight or nine years. It is also estimated,76
NA,that skills shortages will cost the Australian,76
NA,economy $9 billion in lost output over the,76
NA,coming decade. That is the economic cost to,76
NA,the nation of the government's neglect: $9,76
NA,"billion in lost output over the coming decade,",76
NA,with $20 billion worth of major infrastruc-,76
NA,ture and resources projects in jeopardy.,76
NA,"Moreover, there are currently between",76
NA,"18,000 and 21,000 unfilled vacancies for",76
NA,tradespersons in Australia.,76
NA,Mr Hardgrave interjecting-,76
Mr LATHAM,"The minister says, ‘The",76
NA,"government talks about trades.' Minister,",76
NA,how about investing in the trades to fill the,76
NA,"shortage? There are nearly 22,000 unfilled",76
NA,vacancies for tradespersons in Australia. If,76
NA,this government had been investing in trades,76
NA,instead of just talking about them over the,76
NA,last nine years that figure would not stand,76
NA,there as a major blockage to the prospects of,77
NA,the Australian economy. It is also estimated,77
NA,that the number of apprenticeships in tradi-,77
NA,tional trades has dropped 15 per cent under,77
NA,the Howard government. So there is a record,77
NA,"of neglect, and all the minister can do in",77
NA,question time is make the cheapest points to,77
NA,try and overcome the neglect of the Howard,77
NA,government over a long period of time. What,77
NA,has been the government's response? What,77
NA,do we find in the Governor-General's ad-,77
NA,dress to the parliament? The government's,77
NA,plan is to build a series of federally con-,77
NA,trolled and run technical colleges to try to,77
NA,reinvent the wheel. The skills shortage is,77
NA,affecting Australia right now. We do not have,77
NA,"four years to waste, four years to wait for",77
NA,construction of these technical colleges.,77
NA,What is wrong with investing in TAFE right,77
NA,now to build a world-class training and voca-,77
NA,tional education system? Why wait four,77
NA,"years, Minister? Why wait four years to",77
NA,solve a problem that threatens the prosperity,77
NA,of the Australian economy right now?,77
NA,The minister and the government need to,77
NA,accept the neglect. They need to recognise,77
NA,these figures and they need to do better than,77
NA,a four-year wait to build the infrastructure,77
NA,and invest in the capacity of Australians to,77
NA,develop their skills. What is wrong with in-,77
NA,vesting in TAFE right now? There is no need,77
NA,to reinvent the wheel. We need the invest-,77
NA,"ment in TAFE right now. In fact, this would",77
NA,be the most efficient use of public money.,77
NA,Why reinvent the wheel and build a new sys-,77
NA,"tem that involves duplication of resources,",77
NA,"red tape, more administration and bureauc-",77
NA,racy? Isn't the whole purpose to get scarce,77
NA,public resources into the education and train-,77
NA,ing system for the benefit of the Australian,77
NA,people? So wouldn't it be wise for this gov-,77
NA,ernment to not have to reinvent the wheel-a,77
NA,separate system with its own administration,77
NA,"systems, its own bureaucracy and its own red",77
NA,tape? Why duplicate the system when we,77
NA,"could invest in TAFE right now, put in the",77
NA,federal resources and build a world-class,77
NA,system?,77
NA,There are further problems with the dupli-,77
NA,"cation, the reinvention of the wheel through",77
NA,these technical colleges. Will there be ac-,77
NA,creditation of courses for students? Say a,77
NA,student goes to year 11 in a technical college,77
NA,in a particular part of the country and then,77
NA,the family moves to another part of the coun-,77
NA,try where there is no federally run and man-,77
NA,aged college. Will there be accreditation of,77
NA,those courses when they go to the local,77
NA,TAFE or the local school that specialises in,77
NA,"the technical skills? Also, will there be port-",77
NA,ability for teaching staff? Will there be con-,77
NA,the sistency of the curricula between the various,77
NA,institutions? The minister just shakes his,77
NA,head. It is going to fall off soon. He does not,77
NA,know the answers to these basic propositions,77
NA,that are fundamental to solving the skills,77
NA,shortage in this country.,77
NA,It defies the Prime Minister's own advice,77
NA,at the recent Local Government Association,77
NA,conference about the best way of getting a,77
NA,solution to a public policy problem. This is,77
NA,what the Prime Minister said at the Local,77
NA,Government Association convention in Can-,77
NA,berra on 10 November:,77
NA,... we really have a responsibility to make the,77
NA,present system of government work as efficiently,77
NA,as possible and one of the ways in which we do,77
NA,that is to recognise that nothing is more destruc-,77
NA,tive of the efficient working of the present system,77
NA,of government than for any level to engage in,77
NA,"cost shifting, to recognise that if you do have a",77
NA,division of responsibilities and particular levels of,77
NA,government are given resources they have a re-,77
NA,sponsibility to use those resources wisely to dis-,77
NA,charge their responsibilities.,77
NA,"Applied to the skills shortage, applied to the",77
NA,question of training and vocational education,77
NA,"in Australia, that statement by the Prime",77
NA,Minister is a recommendation to invest in,77
NA,"TAFE: don't duplicate, don't cost-shift, don't",77
NA,reinvent the wheel; invest in TAFE right now,78
NA,to solve the critical skills shortage in this,78
NA,country. That is Labor's approach. Labor's,78
NA,approach is to ensure that in the future TAFE,78
NA,"will be a world-class system, that we invest",78
NA,"in it, that we build quality, that we build efficapability",78
NA,"ciency, that we build the outcomes that are",78
NA,needed for a skills revival in this country.,78
NA,The government is talking about trades but it,78
NA,"is not investing in them, and it will not have",78
NA,a solution to the problem that we have right,78
NA,"now until four years down the track, if and",78
NA,when these technical colleges are constructed,78
NA,and open.,78
NA,Labor's approach is to build a world-class,78
NA,"TAFE system, and I am sure that employers",78
NA,in small and large businesses right around,78
NA,the country looking for a solution right now,78
NA,would see the sense in our approach. There,78
NA,will be a lot of questioning of the govern-,78
NA,ment's long delay in addressing this prob-,78
NA,lem; of the duplication; of the extra admini-,78
NA,stration and bureaucracy; and of the issues of,78
NA,portability and accreditation. The govern-,78
NA,"ment is yet to answer any of these questions,",78
NA,but right now businesses are looking for an,78
NA,answer to the skills shortage. Australian,78
NA,homebuyers of course want the skills short-,78
NA,age and the capacity constraints addressed so,78
NA,that there is less pressure on interest rates in,78
NA,this country.,78
NA,Labor support the TAFE system; we want,78
NA,to make it truly world class and we want to,78
NA,put it in the framework of lifelong learning.,78
NA,The skills of the Australian people rely on,78
NA,"lifelong learning, not just at TAFE but right",78
NA,through the education system. Early child-,78
NA,hood development is the great area of under-,78
NA,investment and neglect by the Howard gov-,78
NA,ernment. They have been talking about an,78
NA,early childhood agenda for eight years but,78
NA,they are doing nothing. Labor want to see,78
NA,early childhood development extend the,78
NA,principles of public education into child care,78
NA,and preschool. We recognise that learning,78
NA,does not start on the first day of school; it,78
NA,starts on the first day of life. Around the,78
NA,"world, there is recognition that we need to",78
NA,invest early in our young people-invest,78
NA,"early in their literacy, their skills and their",78
NA,and extend the principles of public,78
NA,education into the child-care and preschool,78
NA,system.,78
NA,"So, too, Labor want to invest properly in",78
NA,our schools with a needs based funding sys-,78
NA,tem. Early development of skills and ensur-,78
NA,ing that every school in this country is a,78
NA,good school: this is the basis of Labor's,78
NA,school funding policy. It defines a new na-,78
NA,tional standard of resources and excellence,78
NA,"for all Australian schools, government and",78
NA,"non-government, and then allocates funding",78
NA,"on the basis of need, ensuring that 9½ thou-",78
NA,sand underresourced schools can reach the,78
NA,new national standard as quickly as possible.,78
NA,The government of course has attacked,78
NA,this policy for its reallocation of resources,78
NA,away from 67 wealthy schools identified in,78
NA,the election campaign-schools which have,78
NA,already exceeded the funding benchmark in,78
NA,"their fee income alone. However, given the",78
NA,"limited nature of government funding, there",78
NA,is no logical alternative to this approach. Re-,78
NA,distribution is not only a fair policy; it is also,78
NA,the most efficient way of achieving a rigor-,78
NA,"ous national standard. Indeed, there is no",78
NA,point in governments establishing a national,78
NA,approach to schooling unless they are willing,78
NA,to protect its integrity. The sooner all schools,78
NA,"can reach an acceptable standard, the sooner",78
NA,governments can maximise the number of,78
NA,families in Australia that realise their aspira-,78
NA,tions for the education of their children. The,78
NA,skills base would be set in the early years,78
NA,"through school, and then they would build on",78
NA,that through a world-class TAFE system.,78
NA,Labor's schools policy is not a punish-,78
NA,ment policy; it is an efficient and fair way of,78
NA,achieving a vital national goal: all schools,78
NA,offering their students a quality education,79
NA,and a decent start to life. In the name of,79
NA,"uity, why should schools without libraries",79
NA,and computers wait any longer for fair fund-,79
NA,ing when schools with boatsheds and rifle,79
NA,ranges have been overfunded for quite some,79
NA,time? These are already successful schools,79
NA,"and they would remain successful, with a",79
NA,"high standard of classroom excellence, under",79
NA,Labor's policy.,79
NA,What we are on about is an aspirational,79
NA,policy-aspirational not just for the few but,79
NA,for all parents and students;,79
NA,just for the King's School and Geelong,79
NA,Grammar but for every Australian school.,79
NA,"This is about defining a common standard, a",79
NA,"national standard, and needs based funding",79
NA,for government and non-government schools,79
NA,alike. Why should people who do not have a,79
NA,school that is up to scratch because of under-,79
NA,resourcing wait any longer to realise their,79
NA,legitimate aspirations for the skills develop-,79
NA,ment of their children and the education of,79
NA,"the next generation? Under this policy, 2½",79
NA,thousand needy private schools would bene-,79
NA,fit from the needs based funding.,79
NA,Beyond that-beyond early childhood de-,79
NA,"velopment, needs based school funding and a",79
NA,world-class TAFE system-we need access,79
NA,and affordability in the higher education sys-,79
NA,"tem in this country. Beyond that, we need a",79
NA,commitment to adult and community educa-,79
NA,tion-to skills for life-through the renewal,79
NA,of education and vocational capacity across a,79
NA,full lifespan.,79
NA,These are the critical issues. It is the,79
NA,blending of economic and education policy;,79
NA,it is the area where the government has got it,79
NA,wrong. These two issues need to come to-,79
NA,gether. There is no more pressing issue for,79
NA,the management of the economy than the,79
NA,skills shortage. There is no more pressing,79
NA,area of government neglect than the underin-,79
NA,"vestment in TAFE, the underinvestment in",79
NA,vocational education and training. There has,79
NA,eqbeen an historic underinvestment for eight or,79
NA,"nine years, and that is why the figures are so",79
NA,bad. That is why we have the Australian In-,79
NA,dustry Group reporting that over half of the,79
NA,businesses surveyed in Australia face skills,79
NA,shortages.,79
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,79
Mr LATHAM,The government back-,79
NA,bench think it is funny. They claim to repre-,79
NA,"sent business and trade interests, but they",79
NA,will not invest in the trades to overcome the,79
NA,aspirational not skills shortages.,79
NA,The minister has no answer for these,79
NA,things. He cannot give a basic answer as to,79
NA,why the government will not invest in TAFE.,79
NA,He cannot give a basic answer as to why it is,79
NA,going to take four years to build the technical,79
NA,colleges. He cannot give a basic answer as to,79
NA,why they should try to reinvent the wheel,79
NA,"with duplication, new bureaucracy and new",79
NA,administration. He cannot give answers,79
NA,about accreditation of courses or portability,79
NA,"of staff. There is an answer, Minister, and it",79
NA,is called TAFE. It is time that this govern-,79
NA,ment invested in it properly and addressed,79
NA,the skills shortage that way. These are the,79
NA,critical issues that come out of the Governor-,79
NA,General's address.,79
NA,I again welcome the preselectors of Wen-,79
NA,tworth to this fine chamber. I congratulate,79
NA,the new member for Wentworth on his long,79
NA,struggle to arrive in this place; we look for-,79
NA,ward with great interest and anticipation to,79
NA,the things that he is about to tell the House of,79
NA,Representatives.,79
The SPEAKER,Order! Before I call the,79
NA,"honourable member for Wentworth, I remind",79
NA,the House that this is the honourable mem-,79
NA,ber's first speech. I ask the House to extend,79
NA,the usual courtesies.,79
Mr TURNBULL ,Wentworth) (4.07,79
NA,p.m.)-I am proud and honoured to address,79
NA,this House today as the member for Wen-,79
NA,"tworth, whose people I thank for the great",80
NA,trust they have reposed in me. Each of us,80
NA,comes to this House to represent our own,80
NA,"communities, each unique, each making up",80
NA,Australia-the home all of us are pledged to,80
NA,serve. Wentworth's green hills and golden,80
NA,beaches are strung like jewels between the,80
NA,harbour and the sea. From the tropical gullies,80
NA,of Bronte and Cooper Park to the urban bus-,80
NA,"tle of Bondi Junction and Double Bay, from",80
NA,the sheltered rock pools of Watsons Bay to,80
NA,"the thundering surf at Tamarama, Wen-",80
NA,tworth's geography is as varied and engaging,80
NA,as its people.,80
NA,It is not a big place. You can paddle a surf,80
NA,"ski from one end to the other in an hour,",80
NA,which is not a lot longer than it takes to drive,80
NA,in peak traffic. Wentworth's most endearing,80
NA,aspect is perhaps its least well known. Con-,80
NA,"trary to popular myth, our community is",80
NA,"egalitarian, democratic and far from ho-",80
NA,mogenous. Like many of Wentworth's resi-,80
NA,"dents, I grew up living in flats-mostly",80
NA,"rented-and, in the style of the times, with",80
NA,"small rooms running off a long, dark corri-",80
NA,dor. I did not feel deprived of anything-,80
NA,"apart, perhaps, from a dog. I was rarely in-",80
NA,side. The best things in Wentworth-the,80
NA,"waves at Bondi, the ducks at Centennial Park",80
NA,or even the brisk nor'easter whipping down,80
NA,the harbour on a summer's day-take no,80
NA,account of your bank balance.,80
NA,Most mornings my father and I went for a,80
NA,swim at North Bondi Surf Club. The surf,80
NA,club showers were no respecters of rank or,80
NA,privilege. Our companions included judges,80
NA,"and garbos, teachers and policemen and",80
NA,businessmen of all types-from shmattas in,80
NA,Surry Hills to high finance in Martin Place.,80
NA,There were surgeons whose hands saved,80
NA,lives and there were gentlemen whose cal-,80
NA,"loused hands were used, in a rather emphatic",80
NA,"manner, to collect debts for bookies.",80
NA,Wentworth was multicultural before the,80
NA,term was invented. Our prayers fly heaven-,80
NA,"ward, not just in English but in the language",80
NA,of the New Testament at St George's Greek,80
NA,"church, of the Old Testament at Central",80
NA,"Synagogue and our many other shuls and, if",80
NA,you believe the Irish-and who would doubt,80
NA,them?-just once a year in the tongue of the,80
NA,angels themselves at St Patrick's in Bondi.,80
NA,Wentworth has the largest Jewish commu-,80
NA,nity in our city. The community has grown,80
NA,stronger with successive waves of immigra-,80
NA,"tion from Europe, from Russia, from Israel",80
NA,and from South Africa. Their generous,80
NA,"community spirit, their family pride and tire-",80
NA,less enterprise are admired by all of us. Aus-,80
NA,"tralia is a good friend of Israel, the Middle",80
NA,East's only democracy. We have been reso-,80
NA,lute in supporting Israel's right to take the,80
NA,necessary steps to defend itself from terror.,80
NA,The death of Arafat has now opened up new,80
NA,opportunities for peace based on the road-,80
NA,"map-two states within secure, internation-",80
NA,ally recognised boundaries. We must hope,80
NA,"and pray that all parties, in the words of King",80
NA,"David's 34th Psalm, do not merely ‘seek'",80
NA,peace but ‘pursue' it.,80
NA,Wentworth is a federation seat and its rep-,80
NA,resentatives have been as distinguished as,80
NA,the great colonial statesman after whom it is,80
NA,"named. The longest serving, Sir Eric Harri-",80
NA,"son, was Sir Robert Menzies' deputy and a",80
NA,co-founder of the Liberal Party 60 years ago.,80
NA,I salute all my predecessors and thank them,80
NA,"for their service, which has set a high bar for",80
NA,my own.,80
NA,"I was an only child, and my parents split",80
NA,"when I was nine. My father, Bruce Turnbull,",80
NA,was a single parent for much of my child-,80
NA,hood. All divorces are difficult and painful.,80
NA,My parents' was no exception. My mother,80
NA,had moved overseas. My father and I moved,80
NA,into a smaller flat. Yet my father never spoke,80
NA,a critical word in my presence about my,80
NA,"mother, nor she about him. He went to the",81
NA,"greatest pains to ensure, very successfully,",81
NA,that my mother and I remained on the most,81
NA,"loving terms. I was very close to my parents,",81
NA,both of whom died long ago and far too,81
NA,young. I thank them for their great love.,81
NA,I will work here to defend and promote,81
NA,marriage and families. We must do more to,81
NA,help families stay together. When divorce,81
NA,"occurs, we must do all we can to help par-",81
NA,"ents, no matter how bitter their differences,",81
NA,to support each other's vital role in the life,81
NA,their children. I am proud to be part of a,81
NA,government that has already made great,81
NA,strides to make family law more about fami-,81
NA,lies and less about divorce. But we must al-,81
NA,ways remember that those of us with intact,81
NA,"families owe as much to providence, or good",81
NA,"fortune, as we do to commitment and in this,",81
NA,"as in so many other areas of social policy, we",81
NA,"are not called to judge or preach, only to help",81
NA,and to heal.,81
NA,Like most children who live in Wentworth,81
NA,my father chose to send me to an independ-,81
NA,ent school. I boarded at Sydney Grammar,81
NA,"from the age of eight as my father, a hotel",81
NA,"broker, travelled around New South Wales",81
NA,on business. Sometimes when I was at home,81
NA,on school holidays he would take me with,81
NA,"him, often to complete a stocktake before a",81
NA,pub was sold. I was counting beer glasses,81
NA,long before I was old enough to drink out of,81
NA,them. My father found paying the school,81
NA,"fees was often a struggle, but he chose to",81
NA,postpone other things like buying a flat of,81
NA,our own so that I could go to the school he,81
NA,chose for me.,81
NA,This came back to me vividly when the,81
NA,election campaign was in full swing and the,81
NA,Labor Party was declaring that so-called elite,81
NA,schools deserved little or no government,81
NA,funding. I knew exactly which parents that,81
NA,"policy would hurt the most: the battlers, the",81
NA,"renters, the Bruce Turnbulls of today, who",81
NA,choose to sacrifice personal comforts so they,81
NA,can give their children the education they,81
NA,have chosen for them.,81
NA,I met the love of my life in 1978. Lucy,81
NA,Hughes was 19 and I was 23. She was smart,81
NA,and happy. She shone with love and opti-,81
NA,"mism, as she does today. I immediately pro-",81
NA,"posed and, two years later, she relented and",81
NA,we were married. Lucy has been my partner,81
NA,"in life and in love, in law and in business. In",81
NA,"addition to all that, and bringing up our chil-",81
NA,"of dren, she was the first woman to be Deputy",81
NA,Lord Mayor and then Lord Mayor of Sydney.,81
NA,She oversaw the expansion of the city's,81
NA,"boundaries into Kings Cross and Glebe, and",81
NA,her disarming charm and keen vision are,81
NA,sorely missed.,81
NA,"Lucy and our daughter, Daisy, who is at",81
NA,"Sydney University, are here today. Our son,",81
NA,"Alex, also at University, is overseas watch-",81
NA,"ing us on the Internet. Lucy's mother, Jo-",81
NA,"anna, is with us today, as is her father, Tom",81
NA,"Hughes, and his wife, Chrissie. Tom was a",81
NA,member of this House for nine years and At-,81
NA,torney-General in the Gorton government. I,81
NA,could not have asked for a more loyal friend,81
NA,or a better role model.,81
NA,Apart from loading bananas in the city,81
NA,"markets, my first real job was as a journal-",81
NA,ist-a political correspondent at state parlia-,81
NA,ment. I suppose it was just downhill from,81
NA,that noble calling into 25 years of law and,81
NA,business. Lucy and I have found that much,81
NA,of our satisfaction in business has come from,81
NA,starting new enterprises: creating new jobs,81
NA,and new markets for Australian technology.,81
NA,Our life's experience has been that there is,81
NA,little reward without risk. We believe Austra-,81
NA,lia's economy and prosperity depend on a,81
NA,culture of initiative and enterprise which,81
NA,supports Australians doing what we do,81
NA,"best-having a go-and, when things do not",81
NA,"succeed, getting up and having another go.",81
NA,Big public companies and multinationals,82
NA,are no strangers to the political process.,82
NA,"However, the smaller, newer and more entre-",82
NA,preneurial businesses often feel disconnected,82
NA,or crowded out. The cost of regulatory com-,82
NA,pliance falls especially heavily on small and,82
NA,medium sized businesses. We need to ensure,82
NA,that no regulation and no compliance burden,82
NA,is imposed on business unless it is absolutely,82
NA,necessary and the policy objective cannot be,82
NA,achieved in any other way. I hope that my,82
NA,experience in the small and medium business,82
NA,sector will enable those men and women,82
NA,who are the very engine of our nation's,82
NA,"growth to become better understood, as our",82
NA,parliament makes laws that affect them.,82
NA,I believe passionately that politics is for,82
NA,people. It is not an elite sport played only,82
NA,members of parliament. All my life I have,82
NA,practised active citizenship. It is why I first,82
NA,joined the Liberal Party in 1973. It is why I,82
NA,ran for parliament. It is why I have written,82
NA,"and spoken, often controversially, on some",82
NA,of the big issues that await us in the coming,82
NA,decades. It is why I am a director of Clean,82
NA,"Up Australia, our largest grassroots environ-",82
NA,mental action group. It is why for nearly,82
NA,"eight years, as a private citizen, I was chairing",82
NA,man of the Australian Republican Move-,82
NA,ment.,82
NA,I am for the republic: Australia's head of,82
NA,state should be one of us. The republic de-,82
NA,bate brought together many Australians from,82
NA,both sides of politics. The constitutional,82
NA,"convention, which sat in the Old Parliament",82
NA,House and in which many in this room par-,82
NA,"ticipated, was a splendid moment of Austra-",82
NA,lian democracy-when a common love of,82
NA,country cracked the frosted lens of partisan-,82
NA,"ship, and every speech on every side was",82
NA,from a patriotic heart.,82
NA,"Within the lifetimes of most of us, and",82
NA,"certainly in the lifetimes of our children,",82
NA,world we know today will be transformed.,82
NA,Improved life expectancy and the sharp de-,82
NA,cline in fertility are resulting in the old and,82
NA,very old making up a larger percentage of the,82
NA,"world's population, a slowdown-if not a",82
NA,"decline-in the labour force and, in many",82
NA,"countries, a decline in the overall population",82
NA,itself. In the developed world only the,82
NA,United States has a total fertility or birth rate,82
NA,at replacement level of 2.1. Ours is 1.7. In,82
NA,Japan and most of Europe it is 1.3 or lower.,82
NA,This phenomenon has been described as,82
NA,an ‘ageing population'. That is a glib and,82
NA,slippery euphemism. Societies such as those,82
NA,"in Italy, Spain, Greece, Russia and many",82
NA,others in Europe with birth rates of 1.3 or,82
NA,"lower are not ageing, they are dying. A popu-",82
NA,"lation with a birth rate of 1.3 will, absent",82
NA,"by immigration, shrink by 75 per cent over 100",82
NA,"years. This would mean that if Italy, for ex-",82
NA,"ample, has the same population in a century",82
NA,"as it does today, less than a quarter of that",82
NA,future population will be the descendants of,82
NA,today's Italians.,82
NA,Can it be true that at the peak of our tech-,82
NA,nology and prosperity the western world is,82
NA,losing the confidence to reproduce itself?,82
NA,Are we witnessing the beginning of the dy-,82
NA,of the West? Certainly we are at a tipping,82
NA,point in our civilisation's story. Unless fertil-,82
NA,"ity rates dramatically improve then, in a cy-",82
NA,cle of loss and dislocation matched only by,82
NA,"the Black Death in the 14th century, societies",82
NA,with birth rates substantially below replace-,82
NA,ment level will either dwindle into an insig-,82
NA,nificant fraction of their current numbers or,82
NA,be swamped by larger and larger waves of,82
NA,immigration.,82
NA,Our welfare state was devised in days,82
NA,"when fertility was higher, life expectancy",82
NA,"was shorter, medical costs were lower and",82
NA,the percentage of the population over 65 was,82
NA,a fraction of what it is today. Within 40 years,82
NA,the the over 65s will double as a percentage of,82
NA,"Australia's population, from 12 to 25 per",82
NA,cent. In countries such as Japan with lower,83
NA,birth rates it will be closer to 40 per cent.,83
NA,China is not exempt; it may be the first,83
NA,try to get old before it gets rich.,83
NA,Demography is indeed destiny. America's,83
NA,global leadership is reinforced by its strong,83
NA,population. The Economist has estimated that,83
NA,by 2050 the US population will not only,83
NA,have overtaken that of Europe but that the,83
NA,median age of Europeans will be 53-17,83
NA,years older than Americans and 10 years,83
NA,older than Australians. These changes to our,83
NA,population and their consequence of very,83
NA,substantially increased demands on govern-,83
NA,ment for health and aged care will preoccupy,83
NA,this parliament and its counterparts in other,83
NA,nations for the rest of this century.,83
NA,Australia is well prepared to deal with,83
NA,"these challenges, as we have seen laid out in",83
NA,the Treasurer's groundbreaking Intergenera-,83
NA,tional Report of 2002. More than the leader-,83
NA,"ship of any other developed country, the",83
NA,Howard government has not only recognised,83
NA,these demographic changes and their impli-,83
NA,"cations but moved to meet them. There is,",83
NA,"however, no room for complacency. The",83
NA,demographic storm is coming. How hard it,83
NA,blows and how well our children weather it,83
NA,will depend in large measure on the deci-,83
NA,sions we take today and our maintaining the,83
NA,courageous and determined leadership of the,83
NA,last 8½ years. A strong Australia in a chang-,83
NA,ing world will be one committed to enter-,83
NA,"prise, self-reliance, economic growth and,",83
NA,"above all, high productivity. It will be an",83
NA,Australia that recognises that we have a,83
NA,"interest in strengthening, promoting and de-",83
NA,fending marriage and family life.,83
NA,Sound economic management has reduced,83
NA,government debt to the lowest in the OECD,83
NA,and created the conditions for long-term sus-,83
NA,tainable economic growth. Other countries,83
NA,combine soaring levels of government debt,83
NA,and unfunded pension and retirement,83
NA,"schemes. We, on the other hand, have a",83
NA,strong and growing superannuation and in-,83
NA,counvestment savings culture. The continued,83
NA,promotion of savings and self-reliance will,83
NA,be of vital concern for this parliament.,83
NA,As the Productivity Commission reminded,83
NA,"us only last week, our economy is driven by",83
NA,"three Ps: population, participation in the",83
NA,work force and productivity. With slow,83
NA,"growth or no growth in the labour force, the",83
NA,only factor which can drive our economy this,83
NA,century will be improving productivity.,83
NA,There will be growing claims on govern-,83
NA,ments in the years ahead; only higher pro-,83
NA,ductivity can generate the revenues to meet,83
NA,them.,83
NA,There is no conflict between good public,83
NA,health and education on the one hand and,83
NA,economic reform and productivity on the,83
NA,other. Nothing increases choice or widens the,83
NA,horizons of families more than a strong,83
NA,"economy. Indeed, without the tax revenues",83
NA,that only a strong economy can deliver and a,83
NA,government capable of keeping that econ-,83
NA,"omy strong, even the warmest words and",83
NA,kindest hearts will bring cold comfort to the,83
NA,aged and the sick.,83
NA,Our birth rate is higher than that of most,83
NA,"comparable countries, but it is in the national",83
NA,interest that it decline no further and ideally,83
NA,increase. The government's family policies,83
NA,have already helped more parents have the,83
NA,"families they want. But, just as the causes for",83
NA,this unprecedented decline in fertility are,83
NA,"debatable, so are the appropriate policy re-",83
NA,vital sponses unclear. Over time some will be,83
NA,"more effective than others. Pragmatism, ex-",83
NA,perience and commonsense will be better,83
NA,guides than ideology. There is nothing any of,83
NA,us are likely to do which is more important,83
NA,for the future of this nation than raise chil-,83
NA,dren. Motherhood and fatherhood have been,83
NA,"greatly devalued, and this has occurred to",83
NA,our grave cost. We must affirm that children,83
NA,are a social good and not merely a private,84
NA,optional pleasure. Australia's children are,84
NA,Australia's future. They are our future. We,84
NA,must work to enhance rather than restrict,84
NA,Australians' work and family choices and,84
NA,"recognise that it is desirable for women, if",84
NA,"they wish, to fulfil two goals: child-bearing",84
NA,and a career. Our society's survival depends,84
NA,on making it possible and easier for them to,84
NA,do both.,84
NA,More workplace flexibility with all it en-,84
NA,"tails is not an option but a necessity, and not",84
NA,just for parents. The worthwhile objective of,84
NA,longer participation by older Australians in,84
NA,the work force will also require more flexible,84
NA,workplaces. We have the technology. All that,84
NA,is required now is commitment and imagina-,84
NA,tion. We need to continue to expand the gov-,84
NA,ernment's skills based immigration program,84
NA,in addition to meeting our humanitarian ob-,84
NA,ligations. Our immigration program is essen-,84
NA,tially a recruiting exercise conducted in the,84
NA,national interest of Australia. It is a competipolling,84
NA,tive world and we want as many of the,84
NA,world's enterprising and energetic to join and,84
NA,strengthen our Australian family.,84
NA,While we wish all other nations tranquil-,84
NA,"lity and prosperity, the fact is that troubled",84
NA,times in other lands have brought many mi-,84
NA,grants to Australia. The social problems aris-,84
NA,ing from demographic change in other coun-,84
NA,tries are likely to bring many more highly,84
NA,qualified immigrants to this country.,84
NA,"More, perhaps, than any other people,",84
NA,Australians are particularly mobile and em-,84
NA,ployable around the world. Already one mil-,84
NA,lion of us are working and living overseas.,84
NA,High skills and easy familiarity with other,84
NA,cultures make Australians citizens of the,84
NA,world. But immigration is a two-way street.,84
NA,"It is a revolving door, in fact. If we are un-",84
NA,"competitive, if our economy falters and if",84
NA,our personal income tax rates remain rela-,84
NA,"tively high or become higher, we run the",84
NA,"very real risk that our best talent will leave,",84
NA,and in large numbers. In some recent years,84
NA,"New Zealand, for example, has suffered a net",84
NA,loss of nearly one per cent of its native born,84
NA,population.,84
NA,It is not just populations which are chang-,84
NA,"ing. So, apparently, is our weather. We must",84
NA,assume on the basis of current science that,84
NA,"our world is getting warmer and our country,",84
NA,"at least, drier. I am proud to be part of a gov-",84
NA,ernment which has led the way in the better,84
NA,management of our water resources. For the,84
NA,first time a federal government has shown it,84
NA,is prepared to take a leadership role to help,84
NA,meet the challenges of urban water supply,84
NA,and cleanliness.,84
NA,The Wentworth campaign was hard,84
NA,"fought, which is no bad thing. The party's",84
NA,"organisation was unstinting in its support, as",84
NA,"were ministers, senators and members.",84
NA,Nearly a thousand Liberals volunteered to,84
NA,work on our campaign and more than 600 on,84
NA,"day. Our magnificent Young Liberals,",84
NA,"some of them voting for the first time,",84
NA,worked side by side with veterans who had,84
NA,joined the party in Sir Robert Menzies' day.,84
NA,Nearly 400 are here today and I thank them,84
NA,in particular for this very moving show of,84
NA,support. I thank all of our Liberal Party fam-,84
NA,ily from the bottom of my heart. I particu-,84
NA,"larly thank our Prime Minister, John How-",84
NA,ard. He provided every assistance we re-,84
NA,"quested and much more. In Wentworth, as",84
NA,"across the nation, he clearly set out the",84
NA,choice presented to the people. His disci-,84
NA,"pline, leadership and teamwork delivered our",84
NA,"victory. Finally, I thank my best advocates,",84
NA,"Lucy, Daisy and Alex. Their love gave me",84
NA,"the strength to run, their charisma made up",84
NA,for many of my shortcomings and their ad-,84
NA,vocacy was as compelling as it was sincere.,84
Mr SNOWDON ,Lingiari) (4.27 p.m.)-,84
NA,For the first time in my whole life in this,84
NA,"parliament, as I rose to my feet I was ap-",84
NA,plauded. I want to thank the member for,85
NA,Wentworth for bringing the good burghers of,85
NA,Wentworth to this House to give me that ap-,85
NA,plause. I am pleased that the member for,85
NA,Wentworth has now initiated his contribu-,85
NA,tions in this chamber by making his first,85
NA,speech. I am sure that he will make many,85
NA,"more, but in a sense none will be as impor-",85
NA,tant as the one he has made today. I con-,85
NA,gratulate him on his arrival in this place. Of,85
NA,"course, we want to make sure that he is on",85
NA,the government side of the chamber for a,85
NA,very short space of time and that we see him,85
NA,relocated to the opposition benches after the,85
NA,next election. I am sure that there is a very,85
NA,high probability of that happening.,85
NA,Later in my contribution to this address-,85
NA,in-reply I want to address particular remarks,85
NA,to the contribution made by the new member,85
NA,for Goldstein in his first speech this morning.,85
NA,I will make those comments when I resume,85
NA,my contribution later this evening. Let me,85
NA,"say, though, how pleased I am to be again",85
NA,addressing this parliament as the member for,85
NA,"Lingiari. It is, in my view, certainly the most",85
NA,diverse and dispersed electorate in this coun-,85
NA,try. It includes not only all of the Northern,85
NA,Territory except Darwin and Palmerston but,85
NA,also the Christmas and Cocos islands. This is,85
NA,unquestionably a most diverse electorate. It,85
NA,is quite the opposite of the electorate of the,85
NA,member for Wentworth. I do not know the,85
NA,"area of Wentworth, but I suspect it is less",85
NA,than 100 square kilometres. The area of my,85
NA,"electorate, for the information of the good",85
NA,"burghers of Wentworth, is 1.34 million",85
NA,square kilometres.,85
NA,Whilst it is possible for the member for,85
NA,Wentworth to dawdle around his electorate in,85
NA,"a day, walking and-depending on his state",85
NA,"of mind-perhaps doing other things, in my",85
NA,own case it takes literally days to travel from,85
NA,one part of the electorate to another,85
NA,"vehicle. Of course, even by plane, to visit the",85
NA,Christmas and Cocos islands requires a,85
NA,"week. In a sense, that shows the contrast of",85
NA,the electorates that we represent in this par-,85
NA,liament.,85
NA,I am extremely pleased-and I know the,85
NA,government is disappointed-at my return to,85
NA,this place with a dramatically increased ma-,85
NA,jority. I am sure that must have been what,85
NA,the applause was all about-I cannot imag-,85
NA,"ine what else it could have been. I note,",85
NA,"however, that those who were so vigorous in",85
NA,their applause have left before I have fin-,85
NA,"ished my contribution, and I cannot for the",85
NA,life of me understand why this could have,85
NA,happened! It must be the invitation list for,85
NA,the soiree which is about to take place in the,85
NA,Great Hall at the invitation of the new mem-,85
NA,"ber for Wentworth. Oddly, I will not able to",85
NA,see the applause continued in that place be-,85
NA,cause I was not invited. I am not sure if any-,85
NA,one-apart from the very close friends and,85
NA,"colleagues, the thousand members of the",85
NA,Liberal Party in Wentworth and the 600 who,85
NA,worked on election day-has been invited. I,85
NA,ask my friends at the table: were you in-,85
NA,vited? Did you get an invitation to this little,85
NA,soiree?,85
NA,Mr Kelvin Thomson interjecting-,85
Mr SNOWDON,No-one did. I have to,85
NA,say-,85
The DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr,85
NA,Causley)-I think the member for Lingiari is,85
NA,straying from the point. I will draw him back,85
NA,to it.,85
Mr SNOWDON,"No, it is very impor-",85
NA,"tant to me, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is very",85
NA,relevant to how we spend our time in this,85
NA,place. I will just say that I regret the fact that,85
NA,we were not invited to continue our conver-,85
NA,sation with the member for Wentworth's,85
NA,"constituents. Mr Deputy Speaker, would you",85
NA,enlighten me as to whether or not to I have to,85
NA,if I use a terminate this discussion now?,85
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,I will ac-,85
NA,commodate the member for Lingiari. It being,85
NA,"almost 4.32 p.m., the debate is interrupted in",86
NA,accordance with the resolution agreed to on,86
NA,18 November 2004. The debate is adjourned,86
NA,and the resumption of the debate will be,86
NA,made an order of the day for a later hour this,86
NA,day.,86
NA,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,86
NA,Question proposed:,86
NA,That grievances be noted.,86
NA,Environment: Climate Change,86
Mr MURPHY ,Lowe) (4.32 p.m.)-I,86
NA,congratulate the member for Lingiari and,86
NA,join with him in congratulating the member,86
NA,for Wentworth on his first speech in this,86
NA,House. I am impressed that the member for,86
NA,Wentworth raised the issue of climate,86
NA,"change, but I think he should get a copy of",86
NA,what I am about to say to establish the facts.,86
NA,However much the Howard government may,86
NA,"congratulate itself, there is no doubt that",86
NA,"many of the government's policies, particu-",86
NA,"larly those concerning climate change, are",86
NA,doing no more than indolently and cynically,86
NA,setting aside some very serious concerns that,86
NA,will leave a cruel legacy for future genera-,86
NA,"tions. Tragically, the Howard government is",86
NA,presiding over an unsustainable growth of,86
NA,"fossil fuel consumption and, in so doing,",86
NA,guaranteeing that Australia will continue to,86
NA,suffer damaging climate change from the,86
NA,effects of greenhouse gas emissions. There is,86
NA,no longer any doubt that burning fossil fu-,86
NA,"els-that is, coal, oil and natural gas-and",86
NA,releasing the resultant carbon dioxide into,86
NA,the atmosphere is increasing the average,86
NA,temperature of our planet.,86
NA,The government pretends the science be-,86
NA,hind the warnings of climatologists is unsup-,86
NA,ported by facts and the vested interests that,86
NA,control the government's policies say policy,86
NA,changes to reduce carbon dioxide emissions,86
NA,would be too expensive. No matter what,86
NA,members of this government may want to,86
NA,"believe, the natural forces that we have",86
NA,unleashed through releasing massive quanti-,86
NA,ties of greenhouse gases will have an in-,86
NA,creasingly damaging impact upon the rural,86
NA,economy and the quality of our life in our,86
NA,cities. Very few credible scientists now dis-,86
NA,count the reality of global warming. The,86
NA,number of reputable scientists who accept,86
NA,the evidence for global warming far out-,86
NA,"weighs the few who remain unconvinced, yet",86
NA,the Howard government acts as if the case,86
NA,for global warming is unproven and action to,86
NA,reduce emissions of carbon dioxide can be,86
NA,put off indefinitely.,86
NA,"Scandalously, the Howard government",86
NA,stubbornly refuses to recognise the serious-,86
NA,ness of the threat posed by global warming.,86
NA,This only mirrors the arrogance of the Bush,86
NA,"administration in the United States, which",86
NA,has been accused by many eminent Ameri-,86
NA,"can scientists of ‘predetermined, inflexible",86
NA,positions' on the dangers of climate change.,86
NA,The Howard government's single proposal,86
NA,for dealing with carbon dioxide emissions-,86
NA,"namely, geosequestration-is unproven and",86
NA,expensive and has not even been demon-,86
NA,"strated at pilot plant scale. Moreover, it is",86
NA,only applicable to fixed sources such as,86
NA,"power stations, leaving the bulk of emissions",86
NA,it is to be vented to the atmosphere.,86
NA,Not only is the evidence for global warm-,86
NA,"ing beyond dispute, but levels of carbon di-",86
NA,oxide have reached a concentration where,86
NA,any further substantial increases could lead,86
NA,to drastic shifts in the world's climate and,86
NA,sea levels. I will state the evidence as it pres-,86
NA,"ently stands. First, since the early 1800s the",86
NA,concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide,86
NA,has risen from 280 parts per million to the,86
NA,"present level of 370 parts per million, an in-",86
NA,"crease of over 30 per cent. Second, the effect",86
NA,of the rising carbon dioxide level has been to,86
NA,increase the amount of solar radiation ab-,86
NA,sorbed by the earth compared to the amount,86
NA,"of heat radiation lost to space. Third, the im-",86
NA,balance between incoming solar energy and,86
NA,heat energy radiated from the earth is now,87
NA,between 0.5 and one watt per square metre of,87
NA,"the earth's surface, approximately equal to a",87
NA,lit torch bulb on every square metre of the,87
NA,"earth's surface, land and seas included.",87
NA,"Fourth, the effect of this imbalance is being",87
NA,felt as global climate change and the ob-,87
NA,served changes are in agreement with well-,87
NA,tested climate models.,87
NA,"Aside from endless droughts, the main",87
NA,concern is the rate at which the polar ice,87
NA,sheets will melt under the additional heat,87
NA,input caused by the imbalance between in-,87
NA,coming solar and outgoing heat radiation and,87
NA,the effect that this ice sheet melting will have,87
NA,upon global sea levels. The evidence that has,87
NA,been obtained from Antarctic ice cores gives,87
NA,us a grim warning of what may lie ahead if,87
NA,carbon dioxide levels continue to increase.,87
NA,Ice core data tells us that current average,87
NA,global temperatures have risen to be equal to,87
NA,the highest temperatures experienced since,87
NA,the end of the last ice age. An additional watt,87
NA,of imbalance between incoming solar energy,87
NA,and outgoing radiated heat energy will take,87
NA,temperatures to the levels of the warmest,87
NA,times that preceded the last ice age. Sea lev-,87
NA,els were then six metres higher than present-,87
NA,"day sea levels-a disastrous increase, were",87
NA,such a change to occur in our lifetimes.,87
NA,While the government refuses to reduce,87
NA,"carbon dioxide emissions, the rest of the",87
NA,"world, with the significant exception of the",87
NA,"United States, has moved to counter the un-",87
NA,precedented threat posed by global warming.,87
NA,Russia has formally ratified the Kyoto proto-,87
NA,"col, and the protocol will become legally",87
NA,binding on 16 February 2005. The 30 indus-,87
NA,trialised countries that have supported the,87
NA,protocol have committed to cutting their car-,87
NA,bon dioxide emissions to five per cent below,87
NA,1990 levels by 2005. This is as much as 25,87
NA,per cent below current levels.,87
NA,Only four industrialised countries-,87
NA,"Liechtenstein, Monaco plus Australia and the",87
NA,United States-remain outside Kyoto. That,87
NA,means that 61.6 per cent of the world's emis-,87
NA,sions are covered by the Kyoto protocol. De-,87
NA,spite an ineffective campaign of obstruction,87
NA,"by the Howard government, policies will be",87
NA,introduced by the protocol members to re-,87
NA,duce the consumption of fossil fuels. Austra-,87
NA,lia is excluded from Kyoto emissions trading,87
NA,and will suffer trade restrictions because of,87
NA,the government's opposition to the protocol.,87
NA,The effect on Australia's balance of trade,87
NA,"will be serious, with significant impacts on",87
NA,the coal exports that are presently our largest,87
NA,earner and which generated an income of,87
NA,$A13.5 billion in 2001-02. Nearly half of,87
NA,Australia's coal exports are burned in over-,87
NA,"seas power stations, and measures that will",87
NA,soon be introduced to reduce emissions from,87
NA,these power stations will have a significant,87
NA,impact on our coal export earnings. I have,87
NA,recently seen for myself an Australian de-,87
NA,signed and built large-scale solar collector,87
NA,that is specifically designed to reduce the,87
NA,amount of coal used in existing power sta-,87
NA,tions. This is located near Liddell power sta-,87
NA,"tion, where solar power is intended to re-",87
NA,place 50 megawatts of fossil fuel power at,87
NA,"Liddell, and I pay tribute to Dr David Mills,",87
NA,whom the member for Wills knows.,87
NA,This technology has attracted great inter-,87
NA,"est here and overseas and, despite a derisory",87
NA,level of support for renewable energy from,87
NA,"this government, solar energy will replace",87
NA,increasing quantities of coal-fired electricity,87
NA,generating capacity. Solar augmentation,87
NA,could presently displace half of the coal used,87
NA,"in Australian power stations and, with high-",87
NA,"temperature storage, these inexpensive Aus-",87
NA,tralian designed solar power collectors could,87
NA,replace virtually all coal fired generators in,87
NA,Australia. These solar collectors if sold over-,87
NA,seas could also displace much of the coal,87
NA,exported from Australia while at the same,87
NA,time producing a replacement income in the,88
NA,form of high technology sales to countries,88
NA,concerned to reduce carbon dioxide emis-,88
NA,sions.,88
NA,The government makes much of the costs,88
NA,that it claims would have to be borne if ef-,88
NA,fective measures to reduce carbon dioxide,88
NA,emissions were to be enforced in Australia.,88
NA,"Of course, the government neglects to ac-",88
NA,count for the enormous subsidies that en-,88
NA,"courage fossil fuel consumption. In 1999,",88
NA,"Professor Quiggin, Australian Research",88
NA,Council Senior Research Fellow at James,88
NA,"Cook University, demonstrated that, under",88
NA,"the GST, the net subsidy for road transport",88
NA,fuel is approximately $2.2 billion per annum.,88
NA,"In addition to this amount, other fuel subsicomment",88
NA,dies include the approximate $1.4 billion,88
NA,annum for the Diesel Fuel Rebate and the,88
NA,expenditure of $2.6 billion recently incurred,88
NA,to prevent the GST adding to fuel price rises,88
NA,for ordinary consumers. This amounts to,88
NA,approximately $4 billion per year in subsi-,88
NA,"dies for fossil fuel use, and yet the governobviously",88
NA,ment claims that measures to reduce fossil,88
NA,fuel consumption are too expensive to con-,88
NA,template. To this sum one should add an ad-,88
NA,ditional $500 million per annum handed to,88
NA,purchasers of the many gas-guzzling four-,88
NA,wheel drive vehicles. This money should be,88
NA,used to encourage Australians to buy more,88
NA,fuel-efficient vehicles.,88
NA,The former Minister for the Environment,88
NA,"and Heritage, Dr Kemp, warned that carbon",88
NA,dioxide emissions had to be reduced by 60,88
NA,per cent if a disaster were to be averted.,88
NA,"doubt this advice did not fit ‘predetermined,",88
NA,"inflexible' positions, so Dr Kemp was dis-",88
NA,patched. Yet cuts in emissions of this order,88
NA,from electricity generation and transport,88
NA,alone are possible. Solar thermal electricity,88
NA,generators can now reliably replace coal,88
NA,electricity at competitive prices and could,88
NA,cut total emissions by 40 to 50 per cent.,88
NA,fordable hybrid vehicles with double the fuel,88
NA,economy of conventional cars and electrifi-,88
NA,cation of the trunk railway routes together,88
NA,with the transfer of the majority of freight to,88
NA,railways could halve carbon dioxide releases,88
NA,"from the transport sector, which presently",88
NA,produces one-third of total emissions. These,88
NA,"measures are affordable, are being intro-",88
NA,duced in other parts of the world and are,88
NA,needed as a matter of urgency if a climatic,88
NA,disaster is to be forestalled. I ask: what sort,88
NA,of catastrophe does Australia have to face,88
NA,before the government will act?,88
NA,Australian Taxation Office: Inspector-,88
NA,General of Taxation,88
Mr RANDALL ,Canning) (4.41 p.m.)-I,88
NA,grieve for the Australian taxpayer. I wish to,88
NA,on the recent report by Mr David,88
NA,"per Vos, the inaugural Inspector-General of",88
NA,"Taxation, into the Australian Taxation Of-",88
NA,fice's administration of the general interest,88
NA,"charge or GIC. In doing so, I would firstly",88
NA,like to extend my personal thanks to Mr Vos,88
NA,for the extensive and detailed work he has,88
NA,done to provide the government,88
NA,with this report. Its conclusions have been,88
NA,reached as a result of detailed investigation,88
NA,and analysis of administrative matters. Mr,88
NA,Vos has also taken time to get out of his of-,88
NA,fice and meet with practitioners and taxpay-,88
NA,ers to get the feel of what the real effect of,88
NA,this tax penalty regime is on ordinary Austra-,88
NA,lians.,88
NA,It is a vivid contrast to the complete fail-,88
NA,ure of the tax office to meet its obligations,88
NA,"and do the same. Indeed, some of Mr Vos's",88
NA,No key findings are for the ATO to do what it,88
NA,promised to do in the much vaunted Taxpay-,88
NA,ers' Charter-a document proposed by the,88
NA,"ATO, written by the ATO and claimed by the",88
NA,ATO to be its standard for dealing with tax-,88
NA,"payers' affairs. Unfortunately, as Mr Vos",88
NA,"fire points out, the ATO has failed to examine",88
NA,taxpayers' individual circumstances and has,88
NA,Aftaken what it considers to be an administra-,88
NA,tively efficient global view of everyone on,89
NA,certain arrangements.,89
NA,"As we already know, the Commonwealth",89
NA,Ombudsman concluded in 2001 that the ATO,89
NA,breached the Taxpayers' Charter by its fail-,89
NA,ure to take the individual circumstances of,89
NA,taxpayers into account in mass marketed ar-,89
NA,rangements. We can see from the inspector-,89
NA,general's findings that nothing has changed.,89
NA,When the commissioner reverses his view on,89
NA,"an investment product, he just gets out a cal-",89
NA,"culator and the investor list, presses a mail-",89
NA,merge button and everybody involved is,89
NA,automatically a tax cheat.,89
NA,So it would be no surprise to members of,89
NA,this House that the commissioner considers,89
NA,with contempt the informed and independent,89
NA,opinion of the Inspector-General of Taxation,89
NA,to have as little relevance as the views of,89
NA,Ombudsman. Mr Vos is in distinguished,89
NA,company-most of the members of this,89
NA,House and the other place have been re-,89
NA,buffed and told at some stage by the ATO to,89
NA,"butt out. The professional bodies, the taxpay-",89
NA,"ers association, the Law Council, have all",89
NA,have had their representative views scorned.,89
NA,It seems the concerns of the Prime Minister,89
NA,himself have been summarily dismissed. And,89
NA,"now, the much anticipated circuit breaker in",89
NA,"the problem of tax administration, the Prime",89
NA,"Minister's personal solution, the Inspector-",89
NA,"General of Taxation, has been put in his",89
NA,place and stared down. The inspector-general,89
NA,has found in his report that the ATO is treat-,89
NA,ing taxpayers inconsistently and therefore,89
NA,unfairly in the way concessions are allowed.,89
NA,Let us make this point up front. The for-,89
NA,"mer Assistant Treasurer, Senator Helen",89
NA,"Coonan, was forced to investigate this re-",89
NA,view in November 2003 for only one rea-,89
NA,son-the universal condemnation and criti-,89
NA,cism of the ATO's handling of the EBA is-,89
NA,"sue. As the dispute lengthened, it became",89
NA,more obvious to MPs and the government,89
NA,that the commissioner's actions were incon-,89
NA,sistent and of serious concern. An inquiry,89
NA,"into the application of the GIC, in particular",89
NA,"as it related to EBA taxpayers, was the inde-",89
NA,pendent and competent view that the gov-,89
NA,ernment could rely on.,89
NA,In March 2004 the PM encouraged mem-,89
NA,bers of this House who had approached him,89
NA,with demands for intervention to wait for this,89
NA,"report, as it would provide the government",89
NA,with the clearest view and the best solution.,89
NA,"Well, the umpire has ruled, and taxpayers",89
NA,have accepted his view-the commissioner,89
NA,should allow all taxpayers in the arrange-,89
NA,ments under review to receive the same con-,89
NA,cessions as those in mass marketed arrange-,89
NA,"ments. To remind members of those terms,",89
NA,they were as follows: no penalties; no inter-,89
NA,the est; allowance of a deduction for the cash,89
NA,component; and a five-year period to pay the,89
NA,"settled debt, with the first two years interest",89
NA,free. But the commissioner has rejected the,89
NA,"inspector-general's findings in this regard,",89
NA,and his reasons for rejecting them are in-,89
NA,cluded in the report.,89
NA,However-and this is a very telling,89
NA,point-the report also includes the inspector-,89
NA,general's secondary comments on the com-,89
NA,"missioner's reasons, and guess what: he re-",89
NA,jects them. Not only does he reject them; he,89
NA,clearly states that some of the commis-,89
NA,sioner's contentions are just plain wrong.,89
NA,"Here are three examples: firstly, the commis-",89
NA,sioner claims that interest remission provi-,89
NA,sions do not provide him with an ‘unfettered,89
NA,discretion' to remit interest and that the,89
NA,power to remit can only be activated in ex-,89
NA,ceptional circumstances. The IGT says that is,89
NA,just plain wrong. The remission power con-,89
NA,tains no express requirement that is to be,89
NA,exercised only in special or exceptional cir-,89
NA,"cumstances. Furthermore, the IGT states:",89
NA,The approach by the Commissioner would seem,89
NA,to unnecessarily restrict the operation of the dis-,89
NA,cretionary power afforded by Parliament to remit,90
NA,the interest charge.,90
NA,"Secondly, the commissioner claims that a no",90
NA,"penalty, no interest outcome would ‘signifi-",90
NA,cantly impact on the future health and integ-,90
NA,rity of the tax system'. The IGT says that is,90
NA,wrong. The remissions for mass marketed,90
NA,"investors, of which there were significantly",90
NA,"more than those in the EBAs, have had no",90
NA,adverse consequences. The IGT also notes,90
NA,that the ATO itself regarded EBAs to be mass,90
NA,"marketed arrangements until April 2001,",90
NA,when it reduced interest for some of the mass,90
NA,"marketed taxpayers, and provides evidence",90
NA,that internally the ATO actually still regards,90
NA,EBAs as a form of mass marketed invest-,90
NA,ments.,90
NA,"Thirdly, the commissioner claims that",90
NA,EBA taxpayers are different to mass mar-,90
NA,keted taxpayers and therefore do not warrant,90
NA,the same settlement. The IGT rejects this,90
NA,claim and notes that he prefers the submis-,90
NA,sions made to him by other parties that the,90
NA,commissioner's views are incorrect. Not only,90
NA,"that, the inspector-general pointed out that",90
NA,mass marketed products for which the set-,90
NA,tlement was provided could only lay claim to,90
NA,five or six ATO rulings in their favour over a,90
NA,period of several years. EBA products were,90
NA,the subject of over 60 ATO rulings and ad-,90
NA,vance opinions in their favour. Those 60-plus,90
NA,"rulings and opinions, along with the chaos in",90
NA,"the rulings section at the ATO, mean that",90
NA,taxpayers and their advisers still have to take,90
NA,"the ‘she loves me, she loves me not' ap-",90
NA,proach to planning their tax and business,90
NA,affairs.,90
NA,Mr Vos is quite clear and firm in his find-,90
NA,"ings. Taxpayers in EBAs, retirement villages,",90
NA,equity linked bonds and securities lending,90
NA,arrangements deserve the same treatment as,90
NA,taxpayers in mass marketed arrangements.,90
NA,Now associated with that finding are other,90
NA,findings about the ATO's administration of,90
NA,"the GIC, many of which the commissioner",90
NA,has reluctantly agreed to take on board. Mr,90
NA,Vos's independence and clear views are ob-,90
NA,viously recognised by the commissioner,90
NA,when it suits him. But these issues will only,90
NA,affect taxpayers in the future. EBA taxpayers,90
NA,are being pushed to insolvency by the com-,90
NA,missioner because he refuses to accept any,90
NA,responsibility for the failures of his office.,90
NA,That is why this parliament must act. As a,90
NA,member of parliament I wish to place on the,90
NA,record that I am personally offended and,90
NA,dismayed by the commissioner's written,90
NA,"comments in a letter to the inspector-general,",90
NA,"dated 8 July 2004, and incorporated into the",90
NA,report as appendix 1. The commissioner,90
NA,claims that the health and integrity of our tax,90
NA,system is jeopardised when lobbying suc-,90
NA,cessfully achieves favourable settlements,90
NA,that he describes as being ‘not otherwise jus-,90
NA,tified'. He is wrong. The commissioner,90
NA,stands alone in his views that the settlement,90
NA,"is not justified. No member of this House, or",90
NA,"indeed of the other place, who is dedicated to",90
NA,"representing their constituents in this, the",90
NA,"highest court in the land, will ever counte-",90
NA,"nance the view of any bureaucrat, no matter",90
NA,"how senior, that constituents are not entitled",90
NA,to have their parliamentary representatives,90
NA,lobby on their behalf to bring reason and,90
NA,fairness to a situation where both are so,90
NA,clearly absent.,90
NA,"Accordingly, members who are very seri-",90
NA,ously concerned about this matter are pro-,90
NA,posing a private member's bill that will,90
NA,"achieve two outcomes: firstly, it will require",90
NA,the commissioner to act on the IGT's find-,90
NA,ings in this report and implement the mass,90
NA,marketed settlement provisions in full for all,90
NA,the affected taxpayers currently in dispute,90
NA,"with EBAs, retirement villages, equity linked",90
NA,bonds and securities lending arrangements.,90
NA,This will bring these disputes to an end im-,90
NA,mediately. The primary tax will be paid; the,90
NA,Federal Court and Administrative Appeals,90
NA,Tribunal calendars will be cleared; further,90
NA,futile expenses and suffocating pressures on,91
NA,businesses and families involved will disap-,91
NA,pear; and a clear view of the future will en-,91
NA,"able all parties, including the ATO, to move",91
NA,forward. ATO staff currently deployed in,91
NA,perpetuating this unholy mess can be reas-,91
NA,signed to more productive tasks.,91
NA,"Secondly, the bill will include overriding",91
NA,provisions to limit the commissioner's ability,91
NA,to retrospectively apply a changed view or,91
NA,amended policy or procedure to situations,91
NA,where the law or its administration by the,91
NA,ATO is unclear. Taxpayers will be able to,91
NA,lodge a disclosure statement with a return,91
NA,where they and their advisers are of the view,91
NA,that specific components of their tax affairs,91
NA,in the relevant income year are not clearly,91
NA,defined in the statutes or are not the subject,91
NA,of ATO practice statements. Such disclosure,91
NA,statements will be required to be accompa-,91
NA,nied by competent professional opinions that,91
NA,"support the taxpayer's interpretation, as are",91
NA,presently recognised by government and,91
NA,business alike. Where such disclosure state-,91
NA,"ments are lodged and, no more than two",91
NA,"years after lodgment, a subsequent ATO ex-",91
NA,amination concludes that tax deductions or,91
NA,"income exemptions are not allowable, the tax",91
NA,"in question will then be payable, subject to",91
NA,"the existing appeal provisions. However, it",91
NA,"will be exempted from penalties, the GIC",91
NA,and the part IVA anti-avoidance provisions.,91
NA,The bill will also incorporate measures to,91
NA,protect the revenue from taxpayers who at-,91
NA,tempt to abuse its effective safety net as a,91
NA,form of statutory tax deferral. The effect of,91
NA,such provisions will be to prevent the penal-,91
NA,ising of taxpayers when best advice is ob-,91
NA,"tained and followed, provided that the ATO",91
NA,is kept informed and is aware of the details,91
NA,of the arrangements. Suffice to say the train,91
NA,of global disputes that have dogged our tax,91
NA,system over the past few years would not,91
NA,have occurred had these measures been in,91
NA,place.,91
NA,These matters should not have to be dealt,91
NA,"with by the parliament, and they would not",91
NA,be if the ATO had done their job in a timely,91
NA,manner or agreed to accept the inspector-,91
NA,"general's independent findings. However, as",91
NA,representatives of the taxpayers of this nation,91
NA,we are obligated to stop this mistreatment of,91
NA,our constituents by the means available to us.,91
NA,Veterans: Health Services,91
Mr EDWARDS ,Cowan) (4.51 p.m.)-I,91
NA,want to raise a serious issue today relating to,91
NA,one of my constituents. It is an issue which,91
NA,also impacts on the broader veteran commu-,91
NA,"nity. In this instance, I have been contacted",91
NA,"by Mr Con Sappelli JP, who set out a very",91
NA,concerning experience he had recently fol-,91
NA,lowing a heart attack. Mr Sappelli suffered,91
NA,"this attack in September, at about 2.30 in the",91
NA,afternoon. I quote from a letter he wrote to,91
NA,me:,91
NA,I am a returned serviceman with private health,91
NA,insurance. As a result of a heart attack in the af-,91
NA,ternoon from 1830hrs that Tuesday I found my-,91
NA,self on a merry go round of hospitals until an,91
NA,eventual permanent bed was found for me at,91
NA,Mount Hospital at 1430 on Wednesday 8th.,91
NA,When picked up by an ambulance that Tuesday,91
NA,evening I was informed that Joondalup Health,91
NA,Campus (the nearest facility) was full and on ad-,91
NA,vice from the paramedics QEII was the recom-,91
NA,mended destination. Having received the neces-,91
NA,sary medical care to ensure my wellbeing at QEII,91
NA,I requested to be sent to the repatriation hospital,91
NA,as my heart condition is an accepted condition by,91
NA,DVA so doing my request to be taken to repat.,91
NA,"However, I was informed that there were no beds",91
NA,"available, then a request for St John of God",91
NA,"Subiaco, ditto. I was then informed that a bed",91
NA,would be found within Sir Charles Gairdner.,91
NA,Wrong again.,91
NA,A bed was eventually found at Murdoch at,91
NA,0100 on the morning of Wednesday 8th Septem-,91
NA,"ber, after further tests to ensure my well being I",91
NA,was eventually transferred to Mount Hospital at,91
NA,1430 that Wednesday. With the exception of the,91
NA,time at Murdoch I was on a stretcher until a bed,91
NA,became available at Mount some 20 hours after,92
NA,being picked up by the ambulance.,92
NA,The requirements by DVA are that should you,92
NA,wish to partake of the services other than those,92
NA,"approved by them without permission from them,",92
NA,the cost for those services becomes a liability to,92
NA,the patient and in my case my private fund. What,92
NA,would have occurred had I not been privately,92
NA,"insured, would I have remained on a trolley in a",92
NA,casualty ward waiting to either die or wait until a,92
NA,suitable bed vacancy became available in the ap-,92
NA,propriately approved facility in accordance with,92
NA,DVA protocol.,92
NA,The last thought in a persons mind when a cri-,92
NA,sis occurs requiring intensive care is to seek,92
NA,mission from a bureaucracy as to whether they,92
NA,will accept any cost incurred by the said crisis.,92
NA,"a consequence the entire doctors, hospital and",92
NA,ambulance accounts (a substantial amount) with,92
NA,the exception of the initial ambulance from home,92
NA,to QEII (paid by DVA) were paid by my health,92
NA,fund with some out of pocket cost paid by myself.,92
NA,One could say that ultimately that is why one has,92
NA,"private health insurance, the fact that my medical",92
NA,"condition is an accepted condition by DVA, by",92
NA,way of principal they should be responsible for all,92
NA,"accounts, irrespective of whether the medical care",92
NA,provided was by an approved establishment or,92
NA,not.,92
NA,Especially given that the majority of private,92
NA,"hospital has similar charges, Hollywood although",92
NA,"a repatriation hospital, it is foremost a private",92
NA,hospital.,92
NA,Where there are not sufficient hospital beds,92
NA,"available within the medical system, which is not",92
NA,"a situation or fault of my making, the system",92
NA,should be flexible enough to allow a person to,92
NA,"make a decision, which is in his or her best",92
NA,est without having to seek prior permission as to,92
NA,which DVA approved facility is most appropriate.,92
NA,I think Mr Sappelli raises a number of im-,92
NA,"portant issues in his letter. Firstly, I was un-",92
NA,der the impression that Hollywood Private,92
NA,Hospital was supposed to give priority to,92
NA,"veterans, and I am surprised that he was re-",92
NA,fused admission. Hollywood Private Hospital,92
NA,has a very good reputation amongst the vet-,92
NA,"eran community, and I can fully understand",92
NA,why a veteran would want to go to Holly-,92
NA,wood hospital.,92
NA,"Secondly, the issue that Mr Sappelli raises",92
NA,in relation to veterans needing private health,92
NA,cover is certainly one which is causing con-,92
NA,"cern to many veterans, given the demise of",92
NA,"the gold card. Indeed, what would have hap-",92
NA,pened had Mr Sappelli not had private health,92
NA,"cover? Traditionally, in this nation, veterans",92
NA,who have Department of Veterans' Affairs,92
NA,accepted war caused disabilities or illness,92
NA,have had those conditions treated at the ex-,92
NA,"pense of DVA. In recent years, however, our",92
NA,per- nation appears to be turning its back on the,92
NA,proper care of veterans. Many veterans are,92
NA,As now faced with the dilemma of whether or,92
NA,not they should take out private health cover,92
NA,to ensure they get treatment for conditions,92
NA,accepted as war caused. What a disgraceful,92
NA,situation this is!,92
NA,Are men and women who have served this,92
NA,nation and who have suffered medical condi-,92
NA,tions as a result of that service no longer en-,92
NA,titled to have those conditions treated,92
NA,through DVA? When did this change come,92
NA,about? Has it come about by way of gov-,92
NA,ernment policy change or by way of sheer,92
NA,neglect of our duty of care to our nation's,92
NA,veterans? I suspect it is the latter.,92
NA,I say that because many veterans will now,92
NA,tell you that accessing medical care with the,92
NA,use of a DVA card-gold or white-is be-,92
NA,"coming increasingly difficult, and this is a",92
NA,situation that the government must address.,92
NA,inter- Why should Australia's ageing veterans have,92
NA,"to carry the cost of their own medical care,",92
NA,and why should they be forced to accept sec-,92
NA,ond-rate treatment by this nation when they,92
NA,gave the nation first-class service in the,92
NA,prime of their youth?,92
NA,I also want to take this opportunity to,92
NA,"compliment Blue Ryan, the National Presi-",92
NA,"dent of the TPI Association, for his dedica-",92
NA,tion to the cause of his members and for his,92
NA,"personal commitment to Australia's sick,",93
NA,ageing and disabled veterans and T&PIs and,93
NA,their families. I know the issue I have raised,93
NA,here today is one of great concern to Blue,93
NA,Ryan and his members because it goes to the,93
NA,heart of their wellbeing. I say to Blue Ryan:,93
NA,"Blue, keep up the good work. I call on the",93
NA,veteran community to get behind the likes of,93
NA,Blue Ryan and Tim MCCombe and Graham,93
NA,Walker from the Vietnam Veterans Federa-,93
NA,tion and be prepared to unite and fight to,93
NA,restore the principle of proper medical care,93
NA,for our veterans.,93
NA,Next year we will have numerous celebra-,93
NA,tions to mark the 90th anniversary of the,93
NA,landing at Gallipoli and the 60th anniversary,93
NA,of the ending of World War II. I just want to,93
NA,pose this question: how can we possibly,93
NA,mark these significant hallmarks of our his-,93
NA,tory with any integrity or sincerity at a time,93
NA,when we are downgrading medical care for,93
NA,our ageing veteran community? Mr Sappelli,93
NA,said that this is a matter of principle. It is,93
NA,"indeed a matter of principle, and while I",93
NA,know that the current minister is only new in,93
NA,the job I call on her to redress this serious,93
NA,and disgraceful situation as a matter of priorCoast,93
NA,ity.,93
NA,"In conclusion, we in this nation have had a",93
NA,very strong commitment over a long period,93
NA,of time to the men and women of this nation,93
NA,who have gone overseas and served this na-,93
NA,tion in the armed forces and who in so do-,93
NA,ing-usually in the prime of their life-have,93
NA,ultimately paid a heavy penalty in later years,93
NA,as a result in terms of their health due to,93
NA,impact of war caused disabilities and war,93
NA,caused illnesses. It is not good enough for,93
NA,this nation to now turn its back on those ser-,93
NA,"vicemen and their families, particularly as",93
NA,many of those service men and women are,93
NA,now ageing and in greater need of care and,93
NA,medical support than at any other time of,93
NA,their life.,93
NA,Sunshine Coast Regional Organisation of,93
NA,Councils,93
Mr SLIPPER ,Fisher (5.01 p.m.)-I rise,93
NA,today to salute the work being carried out by,93
NA,the Sunshine Coast Regional Organisation of,93
NA,"Councils, generally known as SunROC. I",93
NA,have long been on the record as supporting,93
NA,"the amalgamation of the City of Caloundra,",93
NA,the Shire of Noosa and the Shire of Ma-,93
NA,roochy so that the Sunshine Coast would be,93
NA,"able to portray itself as a strong, united re-",93
NA,gion and be best able to advertise the won-,93
NA,derful opportunities we have in our area.,93
NA,"Also, if we were one local authority we",93
NA,would be able to deal with all levels of gov-,93
NA,ernment in a very effective way. Having said,93
NA,"that, at this point in time we do not have one",93
NA,"council on the Sunshine Coast, so SunROC,",93
NA,"although somewhat of a halfway house, is",93
NA,doing an excellent job in the interim.,93
NA,SunROC is a voluntary regional organisa-,93
NA,"tion of councils for the Sunshine Coast, with",93
NA,the three local authorities I mentioned a mo-,93
NA,ment ago as its members. SunROC places an,93
NA,emphasis on the development of infrastruc-,93
NA,ture to underpin the growth of the Sunshine,93
NA,"region economically, socially and en-",93
NA,"vironmentally. SunROC has a specific role,",93
NA,function and purpose. It is the pre-eminent,93
NA,government liaison organisation for the re-,93
NA,gional interests of the City of Caloundra and,93
NA,the shires of Maroochy and Noosa. Through,93
NA,sensible and proactive lobbying and council,93
NA,"cooperation, SunROC aims for the Sunshine",93
NA,Coast to have the best physical infrastructure,93
NA,the of any region in Australia. Achieving that,93
NA,excellent level of physical infrastructure will,93
NA,in turn create the highest standards of eco-,93
NA,"nomic, environmental and social infrastruc-",93
NA,ture for the region and the best quality of life,93
NA,for citizens of the Sunshine Coast.,93
NA,The chairmanship of SunROC is rotated,93
NA,between the three mayors. The current,93
NA,"chairman is Councillor Don Aldous, Mayor",93
NA,"of the City of Caloundra, and in May 2002",94
NA,SunROC appointed its first executive direc-,94
NA,"tor, Mr Graeme Pearce, to manage the or-",94
NA,ganisation.,94
NA,SunROC has recently released three,94
NA,groundbreaking studies which will outline,94
NA,key strategies to manage future growth,94
NA,throughout the Sunshine Coast region. The,94
NA,three commissioned studies include regional,94
NA,"economic development, the knowledge",94
NA,economy and land transportation-SunTran.,94
NA,The Sunshine Coast Regional Economic De-,94
NA,velopment Strategy is designed to provide a,94
NA,clear direction for the future by documenting,94
NA,coordinated action plans that promote and,94
NA,facilitate regional prosperity. The study idenstudy,94
NA,tifies priorities to encourage investment and,94
NA,employment growth while ensuring that the,94
NA,region's unique attributes are protected and,94
NA,capitalised upon for all sections of the Sun-,94
NA,"shine Coast community, especially small and",94
NA,home based businesses and professional and,94
NA,"other service providers, as well as all forms",94
NA,of entrepreneurial and export business activ-,94
NA,ity. The aim is the very achievable creation,94
NA,"of 30,000 sustainable jobs in the region over",94
NA,the next 25 years.,94
NA,The knowledge economy strategy re-,94
NA,sponds to a core element of the economic,94
NA,development strategy: knowledge industry,94
NA,employment growth. Future economic pros-,94
NA,"perity for Australia as a whole, and not least",94
NA,"the Sunshine Coast, will rely on this impor-",94
NA,tant sector. Most local industries around,94
NA,"tralia, but particularly the knowledge based",94
NA,"industries, are increasingly advised to coor-",94
NA,dinate within regional clusters to maximise,94
NA,opportunities and outcomes. If these local,94
NA,industries are to transform themselves into,94
NA,regional industry clusters then the following,94
NA,issues need to be addressed and provided for:,94
NA,"research support, skills development and",94
NA,supportive physical infrastructure. An impor-,94
NA,tant part of SunROC's studies has focussed,94
NA,on the practical aspects of SunROC provid-,94
NA,ing support to the public sector in the areas,94
NA,of research and skills development and also,94
NA,focussing on potentially assisting the re-,94
NA,search of tertiary institutions.,94
NA,Regional physical infrastructure is the fo-,94
NA,cus of the third of SunROC's groundbreak-,94
NA,"ing studies. The transportation, or SunTran,",94
NA,study is one of the first steps towards ad-,94
NA,dressing regional transport issues on the,94
NA,Sunshine Coast. SunTran is the first major,94
NA,transport study for the region. Its completion,94
NA,will provide transport strategies that are ab-,94
NA,solutely vital to the future of the Sunshine,94
NA,Coast. Some of the key issues and findings,94
NA,that were identified in stage 1 of the SunTran,94
NA,include that car travel is the dominant,94
NA,mode of transport on the Sunshine Coast-,94
NA,by 79 per cent; that the current share of,94
NA,scheduled public transport is only around,94
NA,"one per cent of travel, which falls signifi-",94
NA,cantly below the overall public transport,94
NA,mode share target for south-east Queensland,94
NA,of 6.5 per cent of all trips by 2011; that a,94
NA,significant change in public transport in-,94
NA,vestment strategy and policy measures by the,94
NA,Queensland state government would be re-,94
NA,quired to achieve a material impact on the,94
NA,amount of private vehicle use; and that en-,94
NA,hancing the cycle and pedestrian network,94
NA,would provide a platform towards decreasing,94
NA,the dominance of private motor vehicle use.,94
NA,But the key issue identified that underpins,94
NA,"all of the above is that, for the population of",94
NA,Aus- the Sunshine Coast region and its demo-,94
NA,"graphic, there is a low level of public trans-",94
NA,port provided by the Beattie state govern-,94
NA,ment. Stage 2 of SunROC's land transporta-,94
NA,tion study will review the variety of transport,94
NA,"options available to the region, and stage 3",94
NA,will cover a raft of recommendations of,94
NA,which I sincerely hope the Queensland state,94
NA,government will closely take note. Both are,94
NA,expected to be completed by mid-2005.,94
NA,I would also like to underline the fact that,95
NA,each of the three studies outlined above are,95
NA,part of the project known as Vision 2025-,95
NA,the Sunshine Coast Economic Development,95
NA,and Integrated Transport Strategy Project.,95
NA,The project has been supported by funding,95
NA,from the Australian government under our,95
NA,very successful Regional Partnerships pro-,95
NA,gram. The three studies also have the support,95
NA,of the three local councils of Caloundra City,95
NA,and the Maroochy and Noosa shires. I men-,95
NA,"tioned the chairman of SunROC, Don",95
NA,"Aldous, who is also Mayor of Caloundra",95
NA,City Council; also involved are Councillor,95
NA,"Bob Abbot, the mayor of Noosa, and Coun-",95
NA,"cillor Joe Natoli, the mayor of Maroochy.",95
NA,"The councils, together with SunROC, will",95
NA,work collaboratively with the Australian,95
NA,government on the outcomes of these stud-,95
NA,ies. It is also expected and hoped that the,95
NA,"Queensland state government, tertiary insti-",95
NA,tutions and the private sector will become,95
NA,closely involved with the strategic project to,95
NA,further develop investment and growth in the,95
NA,Sunshine Coast and region without compro-,95
NA,mising the unequalled and enviable lifestyle,95
NA,that residents currently enjoy.,95
NA,I therefore publicly call on the Queensland,95
NA,Beattie government to assist SunROC with,95
NA,the coordination and implementation of this,95
NA,"strategy, in line with other recently com-",95
NA,pleted strategic work in the regional area. It,95
NA,is essential that we get the strategic action,95
NA,plan for the future development of the Sun-,95
NA,shine Coast region absolutely right and that it,95
NA,is efficiently implemented. With record,95
NA,numbers of new residents moving to Queen-,95
NA,"sland's south-east region each month, it is",95
NA,"crucial that at this time, at this stage,",95
NA,"visage the physical, social and economic",95
NA,development of the region correctly and ap-,95
NA,propriately.,95
NA,"I understand that, to this end, it is pro-",95
NA,posed that an overseeing committee within,95
NA,SunROC be established that will take car-,95
NA,riage of the overseeing of the following,95
NA,tasks: to agree on the top 10 most important,95
NA,regional strategies to be implemented over,95
NA,the next three years and to review the pro-,95
NA,gress of these actions at each stage; to work,95
NA,with the Queensland Office of Urban Man-,95
NA,agement on the implementation of the South,95
NA,East Queensland Regional Plan; to ensure,95
NA,that adequate resources are allocated from all,95
NA,"levels of government to these projects; and,",95
NA,as is always necessary with such organisa-,95
NA,"tions with strategic plans, to coordinate ad-",95
NA,vocacy for the region and to assist member,95
NA,organisations with the government and,95
NA,"community liaison activities, primarily by",95
NA,building stronger partnerships with Queen-,95
NA,sland state and Australian government repre-,95
NA,sentatives to ensure the ongoing partnership,95
NA,among the three tiers of government. I there-,95
NA,fore commend the excellent work that these,95
NA,three studies by SunROC represent and con-,95
NA,tribute towards the future prosperity and sus-,95
NA,tainability of the Sunshine Coast and region.,95
NA,"As I said before, with so much population",95
NA,and economic growth in the region and with,95
NA,so much interest in the Sunshine Coast from,95
NA,"around Australia and around the world, the",95
NA,future that we imagine must be strategically,95
NA,"developed and appropriately, intelligently",95
NA,and sensitively implemented. Any failure in,95
NA,judgment may have serious consequences in,95
NA,the decades to come and for future genera-,95
NA,tions. All levels of government representing,95
NA,the Sunshine Coast have a responsibility to,95
NA,ensure the future sustainability of lifestyle,95
NA,and economic progress. I would like to,95
NA,commend the role carried out by Mr Tony,95
NA,"we enLong, a Sunshine Coast businessman, with",95
NA,respect to what SunROC is currently achiev-,95
NA,ing.,95
NA,"In conclusion, I am very pleased to say",95
NA,that the Australian government have taken,95
NA,our share of the responsibility seriously and,95
NA,have worked in partnership with SunROC,95
NA,and its member organisations. We will con-,96
NA,tinue to do so. All the relevant government,96
NA,members-I am one of them-from each,96
NA,sphere must ensure that we continue to get,96
NA,on board with these strategies so that we may,96
NA,together achieve an even better future for,96
NA,Sunshine Coast.,96
NA,Aviation: Sydney (Kingsford Smith),96
NA,Airport,96
Mr ANDREN ,Calare) (5.11 p.m.)-I rise,96
NA,today to grieve for the future of regional,96
NA,services in this country and specifically the,96
NA,treatment of our biggest regional,96
NA,"gional Express, in its efforts to secure fair,",96
NA,reasonable and competitive access to facili-,96
NA,ties at Sydney's monopoly-owned Kingsford,96
NA,Smith airport. I know my concerns are,96
NA,"shared by others in this place, especially my",96
NA,colleagues from regional and rural elector-,96
NA,ates.,96
NA,"In early November this year, the Regional",96
NA,Air Summit 2004 was held in Canberra. The,96
NA,summit was attended by interested parties,96
NA,"from business, government, the airlines and",96
NA,the airports. I was not able to attend the,96
NA,"summit, but I did make a submission for its",96
NA,consideration delivered by my senior staffer,96
NA,"as an observer, largely based on the inquiry",96
NA,by the House of Representatives Standing,96
NA,Committee on Transport and Regional Ser-,96
NA,"vices, of which I was a member, into re-",96
NA,gional air services in this country.,96
NA,"The committee's report, Regional aviation",96
NA,and island transport services: making ends,96
NA,"meet, was tabled in October-November last",96
NA,"year. At recommendation 22, the committee",96
NA,urged the Commonwealth government to,96
NA,retain its current measures to ensure regional,96
NA,airlines have access to Sydney airport and,96
NA,other capital city airports. I stated in my,96
NA,"submission that, on reflection of industry",96
NA,trends since the tabling of the Making ends,96
NA,"meet report, it might have been advisable for",96
NA,the committee to have qualified this recom-,96
NA,mendation to ensure fully competitive access,96
NA,to Sydney and other capital city airports.,96
NA,Smooth connections and adequate facili-,96
NA,ties are important for business travellers and,96
NA,tourists alike. My colleague the member for,96
NA,the Riverina emphasised the importance of ac-,96
NA,cess for regional carriers to the major air-,96
NA,"ports in her address to the summit, describ-",96
NA,ing Sydney airport as a gateway to her elec-,96
NA,"torate and rural Australia as a whole, which",96
NA,"air indeed it is. The summit, chaired by former",96
NA,Minister for Transport and Regional Devel-,96
NA,"airline, Reopment John Sharp, resolved:",96
NA,"Provision should be made in legislation for fair,",96
NA,reasonable and competitive access of airlines to,96
NA,"landing, airside terminal and landside facilities in",96
NA,all Australian Airports.,96
NA,"The summit also resolved that, in the event",96
NA,"of an access dispute, there should be a legis-",96
NA,lated independent mechanism for review and,96
NA,resolution.,96
NA,"Certainly, Regional Express, our largest",96
NA,"regional carrier, could benefit from such leg-",96
NA,"islation. Rex, as the airline is known, has",96
NA,"been served notice to vacate its gate, gate 39,",96
NA,by 30 November-that is tomorrow. To fur-,96
NA,"ther complicate this situation, the business",96
NA,lounge at gate 39 that Rex has used since it,96
NA,began operations has been leased to a com-,96
NA,petitor airline for 17 years. This is despite,96
NA,public comment by Sydney Airports Corpo-,96
NA,ration CEO Max Moore-Wilton to central,96
NA,west New South Wales's local ABC that Rex,96
NA,could keep its lounge if it wanted to. Rex has,96
NA,occupied gate 39 and its lounge since the,96
NA,collapse of Ansett on a nominal lease of $1,96
NA,per annum to maintain regional air services,96
NA,in what was then a difficult environment for,96
NA,"all airlines, let alone a new regional carrier.",96
NA,Rex has grown into a commercially viable,96
NA,"airline, turning an operating profit of just",96
NA,over $1 million last year. It carries half a mil-,96
NA,lion passengers a year on some 80 flights a,96
NA,"day and has almost 2,000 lounge members",96
NA,and corporate clients making use of its facili-,97
NA,ties for business travellers. Regional Express,97
NA,was more than willing and able to enter into,97
NA,a commercial lease arrangement to retain the,97
NA,facilities that have been an integral part of,97
NA,growth to date and are very much part of its,97
NA,business plan for the future.,97
NA,"As events transpired, Rex did not get the",97
NA,opportunity to put in a tender to retain those,97
NA,facilities. Despite its efforts to negotiate,97
NA,"equivalent facilities since February this year,",97
NA,Rex has only managed to achieve some cer-,97
NA,tainty about its gate and lounge facilities this,97
NA,"morning, after a lot of heartache, negotiation",97
NA,"and, indeed, stonewalling at times by the",97
NA,"Sydney Airports Corporation, which has of-",97
NA,fered Rex exclusive use of gate 47. Rex has,97
NA,also successfully come to an arrangement,97
NA,with Virgin Blue and the SACL to extend its,97
NA,use of the gate 39 business lounge for three,97
NA,months while a new lounge is being con-,97
NA,structed.,97
NA,"While all this is a welcome development,",97
NA,"coming late in the day, Rex has only been",97
NA,offered a three-year tenure on its new gate,97
NA,and lounge at this stage. The uncertainty sur-,97
NA,rounding access arrangements that Rex has,97
NA,endured since February is not something the,97
NA,airline wants to go through every few years.,97
NA,The downgrading of Rex's gate and facilities,97
NA,would have had a negative impact on the,97
NA,"airline's operations, with increased conges-",97
NA,"tion from a shared gate, the need to bus all its",97
NA,"passengers to aircraft, and increased staffing",97
NA,costs due to the need to operate on two levels,97
NA,of the terminal with a lounge 400 metres,97
NA,"away from the departure gate. Further, if Rex",97
NA,had not reached a satisfactory arrangement,97
NA,"today for continued use of the lounge, it",97
NA,would not have been able to meet its contrac-,97
NA,tual obligations to its lounge members and,97
NA,"corporate clients. According to the airline,",97
NA,this would have resulted in the withdrawal of,97
NA,the Canberra-Sydney service at the very,97
NA,least.,97
NA,These are real risks for all regional air-,97
NA,lines and underline the need for a close regu-,97
NA,latory watch on the domestic airline industry,97
NA,and the new airport ownership regime. The,97
NA,"its key regional player, with an operating profit",97
NA,of over $1 million and showing every sign of,97
NA,"healthy growth into the future, was at risk of",97
NA,"being severely marginalised-and, I would",97
NA,"suggest, is still at risk of long-term margin-",97
NA,alisation-by the apparent unwillingness of,97
NA,the owners of Sydney airport to negotiate a,97
NA,lease for it to retain its facilities on a long-,97
NA,term basis. With Australia's largest regional,97
NA,"airline under such pressure, I cannot empha-",97
NA,sise enough the importance of the Common-,97
NA,wealth government adopting the recommen-,97
NA,dations of the Regional Air Summit 2004 in,97
NA,regard to access to capital city airports. I also,97
NA,stress the recommendation of that parliamen-,97
NA,tary report adding that there must be fully,97
NA,"competitive access, not just access, to ensure",97
NA,we do not have the emergence of a dominant,97
NA,two in the domestic airline industry in this,97
NA,"country, with the rest pushed to the fringes",97
NA,with no capacity to grow or take on the lar-,97
NA,ger airlines at some point.,97
NA,The summit resolved that there must a,97
NA,legislative solution to the access issue and an,97
NA,"immediate review of what constitutes fair,",97
NA,reasonable and competitive access. Professor,97
NA,Warren Pengilley argued very forcibly that,97
NA,there is a case for legislation to guarantee,97
NA,fair and competitive access to not only Syd-,97
NA,ney airport but other capital city airports.,97
NA,One issue he raised was that section 46 of the,97
NA,"Trade Practices Act, dealing with misuse of",97
NA,"market power, does not apply to access situa-",97
NA,"tions, because the airlines and the airports",97
NA,"are not actually competitors. Further, guaran-",97
NA,teeing fair access in legislation could well be,97
NA,regarded not as anticompetitive but as having,97
NA,procompetitive benefits encouraging regional,97
NA,players and delivering considerable benefits,97
NA,to regional and rural areas.,97
NA,This was supported by a paper delivered,98
NA,"to the summit by National Economics, which",98
NA,found regional aviation to be vital for the,98
NA,social and economic wellbeing of regional,98
NA,"communities. Indeed, communities with",98
NA,regular air services enjoy economic growth,98
NA,almost double that of those communities,98
NA,without such services. These regional ser-,98
NA,vices would also be served by the establish-,98
NA,"ment of an aviation ombudsman, as recom-",98
NA,mended by the summit. The ombudsman,98
NA,would be charged to investigate and mediate,98
NA,in disputes between aviation industry play-,98
NA,ers. In a complex regulatory environment,98
NA,"which is becoming increasingly cutthroat, I",98
NA,can only agree with the summit that an om-,98
NA,budsman similar to the office created for the,98
NA,telecommunications industry is a common-,98
NA,sense and proactive measure for the aviation,98
NA,industry. The recommendations of the sum-,98
NA,mit provide what would be a working,98
NA,framework to improve the viability of re-,98
NA,gional services for rural and regional Austra-,98
NA,"lia, and I urge the Minister for Transport and",98
NA,Regional Services to support their adoption,98
NA,by the parliament under the guidance of the,98
NA,government.,98
NA,Indigenous Affairs: Palm Island,98
Mr LINDSAY ,Herbert) (5.20 p.m.)-,98
NA,The shocking events of last Friday on Palm,98
NA,Island in North Queensland underscore a,98
NA,"dysfunctional community in disarray, a",98
NA,community that has to be helped. In all of the,98
NA,words that have been said and written about,98
NA,"the riot on Palm Island, I have not been able",98
NA,to find any talk about the real solution that,98
NA,has to be faced. This is a community of 42,98
NA,different tribes that has lost its cultural,98
NA,tage and will continue to spiral downwards if,98
NA,Indigenous leaders and governments do not,98
NA,face this core problem. With 86 years of ex-,98
NA,"perience, just how long is it going to take all",98
NA,Australians to conclude that Palm Island is,98
NA,"not viable, and never will be, while it sits as",98
NA,"an out of sight, out of mind, welfare-",98
NA,dependent community? It will remain a,98
NA,"community where alcoholism, domestic vio-",98
NA,"lence, drugs, health problems, unemploy-",98
NA,"ment, housing, sense of self-worth and liter-",98
NA,acy standards may be the worst in the coun-,98
NA,try.,98
NA,The 42 tribes and their leaders on the is-,98
NA,land have had ample time to do something,98
NA,about the hopelessness that pervades the,98
NA,community. They have had more than,98
NA,"enough money, yet nothing changes, year",98
NA,"after year. Since 1998, when I came to un-",98
NA,"derstand Palm Island, I have been supporting",98
NA,an integrationist model-a model that has,98
NA,worked well on the mainland. There are,98
NA,"8,000 Indigenous Australians in my elector-",98
NA,"ate of Lindsay, the majority living in the cit-",98
NA,ies of Townsville and Thuringowa. Those on,98
NA,the mainland do not share the lack of self-,98
NA,"esteem, the domestic violence, the lack of",98
NA,"job opportunities, the lack of housing and the",98
NA,poor education that typify the Palm Island,98
NA,community.,98
NA,"Premier Beattie's five-point plan, an-",98
NA,nounced yesterday when he went to the is-,98
NA,"land, has to be seen for what is-a recipe for",98
NA,more of the same. The Indigenous people of,98
NA,"Palm Island do aspire to be better, and I be-",98
NA,lieve that the key to that is the current review,98
NA,of the Queensland government Aboriginal,98
NA,Land Act. I strongly support making changes,98
NA,to land tenure on Palm Island. It is the key to,98
NA,improving the self-esteem of islanders and to,98
NA,bringing about local integration. It will pro-,98
NA,vide an opportunity for economic participa-,98
NA,tion and home ownership; something island-,98
NA,ers cannot even dream about under the deed,98
NA,heriof grant in trust tenure. Presently islanders,98
NA,cannot own their own home or their own,98
NA,"land, so they do not have any equity and",98
NA,cannot get a business loan.,98
NA,"The Queensland government will say,",98
NA,"‘This is all too difficult,' and ask, ‘How",98
NA,would we ever handle freeholding the town-,98
NA,ship areas? How would we ever handle the,99
NA,tenure on the balance of the island?' But I,99
NA,remind the Queensland government of two,99
NA,"things: firstly, failure to act will see Palm",99
NA,"Island stay the way it is and, secondly, Abo-",99
NA,riginal people I talk to want this to happen.,99
NA,The most costly mistake that we could make,99
NA,now would be to continue to think that the,99
NA,provision of infrastructure and the introduc-,99
NA,tion of a coordinated program delivery strat-,99
NA,"egy on Palm Island will solve the social, po-",99
NA,"litical, cultural and economic issues impact-",99
NA,ing upon the residents there.,99
NA,I remind the House of the history of Palm,99
NA,Island. The settlement was established in,99
NA,1918 as a government reserve under the 1897,99
NA,Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the,99
NA,Sale of Opium Act. This enabled local police,99
NA,protectors throughout Queensland to remove,99
NA,Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people,99
NA,to reserves. Palm Island was established in,99
NA,the early days as an Aboriginal penal settle-,99
NA,ment. That is how representatives of some 42,99
NA,tribes came to be taken to the island and to,99
NA,form the core of the problem that we have,99
NA,today.,99
NA,Following last Friday's riots no-one mis-,99
NA,understands the need for the community to,99
NA,"undertake a whole lot of healing, and the",99
NA,government cannot do that for the commu-,99
NA,nity. We understand that the islanders need to,99
NA,deal with their historical issues and that govservices.,99
NA,ernments need to look differently at how we,99
NA,do business with the island community. For,99
NA,"the government's part, we can get our sys-",99
NA,tems operating better and our service sys-,99
NA,"tems sorted out, but the answer is not in",99
NA,plane loads of bureaucrats going to Palm,99
NA,Island trying to interfere with the rebuilding,99
NA,"of the community. Unfortunately, Palm Is-",99
NA,land does not have the cultural authority of,99
NA,traditional owners that is found in other,99
NA,communities. This is the result of its history.,99
NA,It is an artificial community. People have lost,99
NA,their way. Young people these days have no,99
NA,idea where they have come from or what,99
NA,their culture is.,99
NA,In the immediate term I am concerned,99
NA,about the influx of strangers who are now,99
NA,arriving daily on the island and what they,99
NA,will bring to the community. This is not a,99
NA,time for radicalism. Out of respect for Mr,99
NA,"Doomadgee's family, I ask that people re-",99
NA,main calm. I am encouraged that the Austra-,99
NA,lian government's new arrangements for the,99
NA,disbandment of ATSIC will see many prob-,99
NA,lems in Indigenous affairs sorted out. There,99
NA,has been a welcome response from Indige-,99
NA,"nous leaders, but governments can only do",99
NA,so much. In the end the community needs to,99
NA,do a lot more.,99
NA,Over the years there have been many re-,99
NA,ports on the conditions of Palm Island and,99
NA,what to do about them. They reaffirm time,99
NA,and time again that the way forward must,99
NA,recognise the contemporary issues facing,99
NA,"Aboriginal people, that they are linked to",99
NA,history and that any response needs to ad-,99
NA,dress that history. Residents of Palm Island,99
NA,have said on many occasions that the lack of,99
NA,an economic base and limited employment,99
NA,opportunities perpetuate the continued de-,99
NA,pendence on governments for funding of,99
NA,basic services. This results in residents who,99
NA,find themselves living below the poverty line,99
NA,in inadequate housing with minimal support,99
NA,Most residents resent this situation,99
NA,and see economic development as the only,99
NA,means of breaking the welfare cycle. This is,99
NA,why I believe that the integration model I,99
NA,have rearticulated today is the only way for-,99
NA,ward for islanders to be able to live a decent,99
NA,life free from the scourge of Third World,99
NA,conditions.,99
NA,I have been travelling to Palm Island for,99
NA,nine years. I despair when I go there and I,99
NA,see the way that the people live: garbage,99
NA,"strewn about the main town centre, homes",99
NA,"that are destroyed, four families living in one",99
NA,"home, alcoholism and domestic violence-",100
NA,and on it goes. We have to change it. We,100
NA,have a responsibility as community leaders,100
NA,to articulate the way to change. As much as,100
NA,many islanders will perhaps say that this is,100
NA,"pretty radical, it is the only way it is going to",100
NA,"change. Otherwise, we will be here in 100",100
NA,years time and it will still be the same.,100
NA,I certainly would like to see the integra-,100
NA,tion of Palm Island into mainstream Austra-,100
NA,lia as the way forward. I do not ever again,100
NA,want to see headlines such as the one we saw,100
NA,"in Saturday's Townsville Bulletin which said,",100
NA,"‘Palm Island Explodes. Police station, court-",100
NA,house torched'. I do not ever want to see,100
NA,headlines such as we have seen today on,100
NA,ABC News Online: ‘Angry scenes at Palm Is,100
NA,court hearing'. It was a disgraceful situation.,100
NA,The media tell me that even on the mainland,100
NA,in the court they were concerned for their,100
NA,safety. This is Australia. This is no place for,100
NA,the violence that has erupted in the north in,100
NA,the last few days. There is no place for future,100
NA,violence. I certainly hope that the Aboriginal,100
NA,leaders know and understand that.,100
NA,The coalition government believe Indige-,100
NA,"nous Australians, wherever they live, should",100
NA,have the same opportunities as other Austra-,100
NA,lians to make informed choices about their,100
NA,"lives, to realise their full potential in what-",100
NA,ever they choose to do and to take responsi-,100
NA,bility for managing their own affairs. In that,100
NA,"sense, we will spend thousands of millions of",100
NA,dollars in the coming financial year on In-,100
NA,digenous specific programs. While much has,100
NA,"been achieved, Australians all want better",100
NA,results. We can get better results. I encourage,100
NA,the Palm Island community to think deeply,100
NA,about a new land tenure model which will,100
NA,see an integration into mainstream Australia,100
NA,and stop the terrible dysfunctional commu-,100
NA,nity that currently exists 70 kilometres north-,100
NA,west of Townsville.,100

NA,"memory, because it is the day that the funeral",100
NA,was conducted for the Independent member,100
NA,for Dubbo. He was a good friend of mine. I,100
NA,am pleased to see the member for Parkes in,100
NA,"the chamber, because he, like me, will be",100
NA,celebrating the victory of the new member,100
NA,"for Dubbo, Dawn Fardell. I am delighted that",100
NA,she had a very good win in the Dubbo by-,100
NA,election last Saturday. On my way back from,100
NA,"Tony MCGrane's funeral on 20 September, I",100
NA,was phoned by various media people from,100
NA,Canberra. It had become public knowledge,100
NA,that I had been approached by an intermedi-,101
NA,ary for two political players with a view to,101
NA,requesting me to vacate the premises as the,101
NA,member for New England. That was the first,101
NA,day that particular issue became public. The,101
NA,next day-or it may have been the day af-,101
NA,ter-the Australian Labor Party referred it to,101
NA,the Australian Electoral Commission and on,101
NA,to the AFP for investigation as a breach of,101
NA,the Electoral Act under the bribery provi-,101
NA,sions.,101
NA,At no stage did I mention any names. In,101
NA,"fact, at that stage I refused to mention names,",101
NA,because I saw it as a piece of political stupidbeen,101
NA,"ity. That night, there were a number of abu-",101
NA,sive phone calls made to a number of people.,101
NA,"Some of them were from one Greg Maguire,",101
NA,who was subsequently-after my speech last,101
NA,Wednesday-recognised as the man who,101
NA,was the intermediary. It was obvious at that,101
NA,stage that Mr Maguire had recognised him-,101
NA,"self as the messenger, even though no-one",101
NA,"had been named. A few days later, the Dep-",101
NA,"uty Prime Minister, John Anderson, made a",101
NA,phone call to Mr Maguire. The message con-,101
NA,"veyed in that phone call was, ‘Get your mate",101
NA,to pull back'-remember that this was in the,101
NA,middle of an election campaign-‘this is,101
NA,"bigger than all of us.' Some would ask, quite",101
NA,"rightly, how I know that. I know it because",101
NA,Greg Maguire told me that the Deputy Prime,101
NA,Minister had rung him.,101
NA,These are the sorts of facts that need to,101
NA,come out in an inquiry. They could not come,101
NA,out in the AFP inquiry because that inquiry,101
NA,"was very narrow, in that it looked at a breach",101
NA,"of the Electoral Act, and the questioning was",101
NA,very narrow. It was based on one conversa-,101
NA,tion and the various witnesses to that conver-,101
NA,sation. I was not at all surprised when the,101
NA,AFP found that there was not a prima facie,101
NA,case to answer in terms of proceeding to a,101
NA,criminal charge. As I mentioned in my,101
NA,"speech last Wednesday night, up until that",101
NA,time John Anderson had spent a lot of time in,101
NA,"my electorate. After that, he was very rarely",101
NA,there; I think he came back on one occasion.,101
NA,He went off to places further north-mainly,101
NA,the electorate of Kennedy.,101
NA,The broader issues that I spoke about ear-,101
NA,lier are the preconditions for funding-the,101
NA,political benefit as opposed to the public,101
NA,good. I will not go through them this after-,101
NA,"noon, but they have been outlined on the",101
NA,7.30 Report and Lenore Taylor had a good,101
NA,article in the Financial Review last week.,101
NA,That was essentially about a whole range of,101
NA,Regional Partnerships programs that have,101
NA,abused in some sense-not in terms of,101
NA,the benefits or multiplier effect of some of,101
NA,those programs. I think the equine centre is a,101
NA,classic example. It is a great program and I,101
NA,"am glad it is funded, but there were political",101
NA,preconditions put on in a number of these,101
NA,cases. Another example is the University of,101
NA,New England cash for comment scandal that,101
NA,occurred some months ago in my electorate.,101
NA,There are other examples in other electorates,101
NA,across Australia.,101
NA,"I call on the parliament, particularly the",101
NA,"Senate, to conduct an inquiry into these mat-",101
NA,ters. There are some very broad matters relat-,101
NA,ing to not only the bribery issue but also the,101
NA,broader issue of political compromise in re-,101
NA,lation to the funding of particular Regional,101
NA,"Partnerships packages. At that inquiry, the",101
NA,people who were witnesses to the various,101
NA,events that I discussed last week are quite,101
NA,willing to present their evidence and to be,101
NA,"cross-examined. For the life of me, I cannot",101
NA,work out why Mr Anderson and Senator,101
NA,Sandy Macdonald are afraid of an inquiry. If,101
NA,I am the one who has wronged in this par-,101
NA,"ticular issue, as they keep claiming, why not",101
NA,barbecue me on the floor of some inquiry,101
NA,and pull me to pieces? Why are they afraid,101
NA,of having an inquiry into this incident? Why,101
NA,are they afraid of the truth? Why do they,101
NA,hide behind that very narrow interpretation,101
NA,of the AFP? They may well have known,101
NA,about that result before the AFP came out. I,102
NA,"do not know that. But I do know, as one who",102
NA,"was interviewed, that it was a very narrow",102
NA,inquiry into a section of the Electoral Act.,102
NA,Are they prepared to make their phone re-,102
NA,cords available? Is the Deputy Prime Minis-,102
NA,ter prepared to make his phone records from,102
NA,that period of time available? I am quite pre-,102
NA,pared to make available my records which,102
NA,will trace the phone calls I made. Is the Dep-,102
NA,uty Prime Minister willing to make those,102
NA,phone call records available?,102
NA,Another issue that has come to light in the,102
NA,last week is that of the Bundarra Grace,102
NA,Munro aged care facility. It goes to the heart,102
NA,of this issue and the right of the MP to carry,102
NA,out his job. I wrote to the aged care minister,102
NA,"some time ago, inviting her to open the",102
NA,Grace Munro aged care facility. She wrote,102
NA,back suggesting that she could not be there,102
NA,but that Senator Macdonald would be her,102
NA,representative. A draft program was put out,102
NA,"with a number of official parties, some of",102
NA,"whom were to speak, of which I was one. I",102
NA,have had quite a bit to do with this project. I,102
NA,received a letter on Friday from Robert Ful-,102
NA,cher-who in my view is a very good gen-,102
NA,"eral manager-of Uralla Shire Council, the",102
NA,hosts of this particular function. They de-,102
NA,serve great credit for the work they have put,102
NA,in. Robert Fulcher wrote:,102
NA,"Dear Tony,",102
NA,The Commonwealth government has advised that,102
NA,its representative-,102
NA,the name is not written here but Senator,102
NA,Macdonald is the representative-,102
NA,has advised that its representative at the official,102
NA,opening of the Grace Munro Centre does not wish,102
NA,for you to be part of the official party or the offi-,102
NA,"cial speeches. The mayor, Councillor Ron Filmer,",102
NA,has asked me to tell you that he regrets to advise,102
NA,you that the council will need to comply with the,102
NA,government's wishes.,102
NA,I think that goes to the heart of this very is-,102
NA,sue. I seek leave to table the document.,102
NA,Leave granted.,102
Mr WINDSOR,I also seek leave to ta-,102
NA,ble the cash for comment documents in rela-,102
NA,tion to the University of New England and,102
NA,the preconditions that were placed on the,102
NA,announcement of that funding and subse-,102
NA,quent political ramifications associated with,102
NA,the University of New England.,102
NA,Leave granted.,102
Mr WINDSOR,I will not have time to,102
NA,go through that particular part of the issue. In,102
NA,"conclusion, I would ask the parliament not to",102
NA,be afraid of inquiring into this issue. There,102
NA,are much broader ramifications of this than,102
NA,the issues that I raised last week. The issue of,102
NA,"truth was raised last week, and the truth has",102
NA,not yet been told. I think that one of the ma-,102
NA,"jor jobs of this parliament, and particularly",102
NA,"the Senate, is to spend time on ascertaining",102
NA,"the truth, and to allow the witnesses to those",102
NA,conversations-and others who have been,102
NA,privy to various funding arrangements and,102
NA,preconditions across Australia-the opportu-,102
NA,"nity to put their cases, to be cross-examined",102
NA,and to be torn apart if that is what is re-,102
NA,"quired. As I said earlier, why are Senator",102
NA,Macdonald and Deputy Prime Minister,102
NA,Anderson afraid of the truth of this issue?,102
NA,(Time expired),102
NA,Regional Services: Program Funding,102
Mr JOHN COBB ,Parkes-Parliament-,102
NA,ary Secretary to the Minister for Transport,102
NA,and Regional Services) (5.40 p.m.)-What,102
NA,we have today is a further attempt by the,102
NA,member for New England to discredit the,102
NA,process of commitments under Regional,102
NA,Partnerships during an election campaign. In,102
NA,"fact, it is an attempt to discredit the Regional",102
NA,Partnerships process.,102
NA,"The normal assessment process, which he",102
NA,could find out about quite easily if he wanted,102
NA,"to, revolves around two different criteria.",102
NA,When a commitment is made in a very nor-,102
NA,mal way during an election it is made on the,102
NA,basis that it is a project that will achieve,103
NA,those things which Regional Partnerships set,103
NA,out to do: to help that area either in a social,103
NA,way or in an economic way. The social out-,103
NA,comes we look for are things like medical,103
NA,"centres, which will have a prolonged, sus-",103
NA,tainable benefit for the region. In terms of,103
NA,"economic outlook, we are looking to create",103
NA,jobs. If it is an election promise then-as I,103
NA,am sure the member for New England is to-,103
NA,tally aware-it still has to go through due,103
NA,process and it still has to meet the criteria for,103
NA,government programs.,103
NA,The motivation we have here-and I will,103
NA,go into that a little later-of the member for,103
NA,New England is not about the Regional Part-,103
NA,nerships program; it is a totally political mo-,103
NA,"tivation. The normal practice, the procedure",103
NA,by which regional partnerships happen dur-,103
NA,"ing election campaigns, is to make that",103
NA,commitment that due diligence will be done,103
NA,following the election-before the project is,103
NA,funded and before it is signed off. Then it is,103
NA,"finally approved; it is a straightforward, open",103
NA,and totally accountable process for commu-,103
NA,"nities and regions. As I said, it is about delivgional",103
NA,"ering economic growth and sustainable,",103
NA,long-term community outcomes. This gov-,103
NA,ernment is very proud of the record of re-,103
NA,gional partnerships. There probably has,103
NA,never been a better program to help commu-,103
NA,nities which have problems of isolation or,103
NA,lack of funding.,103
NA,This is an attempt by the member for New,103
NA,England to get himself out of a hole. He,103
NA,mentioned just a while ago that during the,103
NA,election he made an attack on the person,103
NA,who is probably second to none in this par-,103
NA,"liament for his reputation for integrity, hon-",103
NA,esty and trustworthiness. So strong is his,103
NA,reputation that the media and even the oppo-,103
NA,sition know full well that the Acting Prime,103
NA,Minister is not subject to acts of corruption,103
NA,or acts of bribery and is probably the most,103
NA,"honest person in this House. He is, without",103
NA,"doubt, a paragon of propriety and integrity,",103
NA,and I have no doubt the member for New,103
NA,"England is well aware of that, but he made",103
NA,allegations off the cuff to the media during,103
NA,the election and then tried to laugh it off,103
NA,when he realised he had perhaps started,103
NA,something he could not stop. When the La-,103
NA,bor Party then demanded that the AFP look,103
NA,"into it, he thought, ‘How do I get out of this?'",103
NA,What he did then was to go on the attack. He,103
NA,picked the wrong person to attack. When he,103
NA,"really fell flat on his face was, first, when the",103
NA,person he alleged to be the carrier of this,103
NA,alleged corruption refuted it in the open in,103
NA,"Tamworth and then again when, lo and be-",103
NA,"hold, the AFP looked at the situation and said",103
NA,there was no case to answer.,103
NA,What was the member for New England,103
NA,to do at that point? He had made a fool of,103
NA,himself; he suddenly realised that the me-,103
NA,dia-everybody-knew he was attacking a,103
NA,man who nobody believed for one second,103
NA,was guilty of any of the things that the mem-,103
NA,ber for New England accused him of. What,103
NA,"did he do then? He decided, ‘I'll attack Re-",103
NA,Partnerships. I'll try to make out that,103
NA,there's a corrupt political basis by which,103
NA,these are done.' There is no political or cor-,103
NA,rupt basis involved here. It is a very straight-,103
NA,"forward, clear process by which these pro-",103
NA,grams are put forward and signed off. They,103
NA,"are done by an area consultative committee,",103
NA,a department and the proponent themselves.,103
NA,If you look at the way in which these pro-,103
NA,"jects are put around Australia, they go to op-",103
NA,"position seats, they go to independent seats",103
NA,"and, yes, they go to government seats.",103
NA,Probably the main reason why the majority,103
NA,of the projects go to government seats is that,103
NA,most regional seats are held by the coalition,103
NA,government. So I think mathematics proves,103
NA,that what should happen does happen.,103
NA,I think that what the member for New,103
NA,England has done in attacking one of the,103
NA,better programs the government has ever,104
NA,come up with-simply because he was try-,104
NA,"ing, under privilege of the House, to attack a",104
NA,man whose integrity has never been ques-,104
NA,tioned-is probably one of the lowest things,104
NA,I have ever seen in three years in this House.,104
NA,That is why he is in trouble: he did it and he,104
NA,knows it was wrong. I think the constituents,104
NA,of New England have a lot of questions to,104
NA,"ask a member who, instead of doing his job",104
NA,in representing them and trying to get pro-,104
NA,"jects for them, has stooped to attacking the",104
NA,"Acting Prime Minister, who, as I have said",104
NA,"and will repeat in any forum, has an integrity",104
NA,"that is respected by everyone in this House,",104
NA,with the possible exception of a couple of,104
NA,independents.,104
NA,"I have to say, too, that in this last",104
NA,member for Calare has questioned the pro-,104
NA,priety of the Regional Partnerships program.,104
NA,I find that strange. I find it strange that he,104
NA,"and, in some sense, the member for New",104
NA,England are aware of the program at all. The,104
NA,"Acting Prime Minister, the parliamentary",104
NA,secretary previously assisting the Minister,104
NA,"for Transport and Regional Services and me,",104
NA,"in the short time I have been in this role,",104
NA,have never seen one letter of support from,104
NA,either the member for New England or the,104
NA,member for Calare for any Regional Partner-,104
NA,ships program in their electorates. I think,104
NA,"they would be far better off to get around,",104
NA,"look after their electorates, support their",104
NA,ACC and support the proponents who are,104
NA,looking for projects to help their communi-,104
NA,"ties either socially or economically, rather",104
NA,than try to bring down somebody whose in-,104
NA,tegrity has never before been questioned in,104
NA,his 15 or 16 years in this House.,104
NA,I suggest that the member for New Eng-,104
NA,land and the member for Calare go back to,104
NA,their electorates and do their jobs. That is,104
NA,what the member for New England would do,104
NA,if he were going to be serious after pulling,104
NA,one of the lowest acts we are ever likely to,104
NA,see in this place-using parliamentary privi-,104
NA,lege and not waiting for the finding of the,104
NA,AFP when he could have quite easily done,104
NA,"so; but, no, he wanted to get out there and try",104
NA,and besmirch someone whose reputation he,104
NA,can only aspire to.,104
NA,I have to say that rural and regional Aus-,104
NA,tralia is very well served by a program which,104
NA,has stood the test of some 18 months. Like,104
NA,"its predecessor, the Regional Solutions Pro-",104
NA,"gram, it is delivering to country Australia. It",104
NA,is a great pity that one member in particular,104
NA,is putting a desire to see himself on the front,104
NA,pages of newspapers over the top of decency,104
NA,and over the top of a program which has al-,104
NA,ready helped his electorate some nine times,104
NA,in the last 18 months and helped Australia to,104
NA,week the the tune of over $100 million so far.,104
NA,"I will mention one other thing, which the",104
NA,member for Calare was talking about during,104
NA,this debate: regional aviation. This govern-,104
NA,ment has done an incredible amount to help,104
NA,"regional aviation, including capping landing",104
NA,"charges at Sydney airport, quarantining land-",104
NA,"ing slots, exempting small regional airlines",104
NA,like Rex from en route air traffic control,104
NA,charges and subsidising regional charges.,104
NA,Rex airlines itself acknowledges that without,104
NA,this government's assistance there would be,104
NA,no Rex. This government will look at the,104
NA,recommendations of the regional aviation,104
NA,"summit, but it is wrong to suggest, as the",104
NA,"member for Calare does, that all problems",104
NA,can be fixed by more and more regulation.,104

NA,a privilege it is to see you in this august,105
NA,tion.,105
The DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Hon. K.C.,105
NA,Beazley)-You may say that anytime you,105
NA,like.,105
Mr SNOWDON,Congratulations on,105
NA,your elevation. I am sure you will continue,105
NA,to use your experience and that you will do,105
NA,this job with a great deal of professionalism,105
NA,and aplomb.,105
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Thank you,105
NA,very much.,105
Mr SNOWDON,I am looking forward,105
NA,to the wise decisions which you will make.,105
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,"That is right,",105
NA,and I will sack you at the drop of the hat if,105
NA,you give me any trouble at all.,105
Mr SNOWDON,Prior to the debate be-,105
NA,"ing interrupted, I was privileged to be in the",105
NA,chamber at the end of the contribution from,105
NA,new member for Wentworth. I received a,105
NA,standing ovation as I stood up-or at least I,105
NA,thought I did. But then it dawned for me that,105
NA,it really was for the member for Wentworth,105
NA,and what he had to say and that the 400 in-,105
NA,vited guests who had come down from Syd-,105
NA,"ney to hear his speech were not, in fact, ap-",105
NA,plauding me-which was a great disap-,105
NA,pointment to me-but him. I am not disillu-,105
NA,"sioned, however, because I know they are",105
NA,still around and there is time for conversion.,105
NA,"I did point out to them, and I hope they go",105
NA,back to the electorate of Wentworth know-,105
NA,"ing, that there is a very valid expectation on",105
NA,my behalf and that of others on this side of,105
NA,the chamber that the member for Wentworth,105
NA,will occupy that seat he sits on on that side,105
NA,"of the chamber for only a short time, three",105
NA,"years, and then, unless the government de-",105
NA,termines it wants to have an election before,105
NA,"then, we will see the member for Wentworth",105
NA,experience the vagaries-if I might describe,105
NA,posiit in that way-of the opposition benches. I,105
NA,am sure he will have a long and successful,105
NA,"political career, but I hope that the electors of",105
NA,Wentworth will not be too disappointed,105
NA,when he is not in government after the next,105
NA,election.,105
NA,I want to raise some issues about the elec-,105
NA,tion result and in particular the result in my,105
NA,own electorate. I described my electorate in,105
NA,my previous short contribution. I compared it,105
NA,to the member for Wentworth's electorate. I,105
NA,do not know the area of the Wentworth elec-,105
NA,"torate, perhaps the clerks could tell me, but I",105
NA,suspect it is less than 100 square kilometres;,105
NA,perhaps it is a lot less than that. My own,105
NA,"electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you well",105
NA,"know, is diverse, disparate, dispersed and",106
NA,1.34 million square kilometres. It comprises,106
NA,Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands in,106
NA,"the Indian Ocean, with which you are famil-",106
NA,"iar, and all of the area of the Northern Terri-",106
NA,tory except Darwin and Palmerston. A major,106
NA,element of the electorate of Lingiari is that in,106
NA,excess of 40 per cent of its constituents are,106
NA,Indigenous Australians. It is a unique elec-,106
NA,"torate in that respect, if for no other reason;",106
NA,but its geography and demography make it,106
NA,unique in any event.,106
NA,I want to thank the people of Lingiari for,106
NA,endorsing me again as their representative in,106
NA,this chamber. I would point out that I am one,106
NA,of the few people on this side of the chamber,106
NA,who achieved a reasonably significant swing.,106
NA,I am now sitting on almost 58 per cent-57.7,106
NA,"per cent-which is, for me, a reasonable lux-",106
NA,ury compared with the margin I have been,106
NA,"used to. From my own perspective, it was a",106
NA,significant result. In the seven elections I,106
NA,"have now contested, this is the first time I",106
NA,have won the vote in Alice Springs. It is sig-,106
NA,"nificant that, of the 24 static booths in the",106
NA,"electorate, I achieved swings in 18. Across",106
NA,the 270 mobile polling places our average,106
NA,"vote was 79 per cent, almost 80 per cent, and",106
NA,"that itself was a swing to us. In any event, it",106
NA,showed the confidence not only of the people,106
NA,in the bush and remote communities but also,106
NA,of people in the towns who voted for us and,106
NA,"gave us their support. I am very grateful and,",106
NA,"indeed, thankful for it.",106
NA,I want to thank all of those people who,106
NA,contributed to the campaign-the campaign,106
NA,"workers, the volunteers, my family and all",106
NA,"the others, too many to name, who make an",106
NA,election possible in terms of a candidate's,106
NA,success or otherwise. It is absolutely true in,106
NA,my case that without the work of dedicated,106
NA,"volunteers, many of whom took in this last",106
NA,election more than a week off work to do the,106
NA,"mobile polling, I would not win. It is just",106
NA,physically impossible to get around and do,106
NA,all the things you need to do with the turnout,106
NA,to a poll. It is a taxing exercise in the elector-,106
NA,ate and I would never be successful were it,106
NA,"not for the commitment of those people, and",106
NA,I want to place on the record my thanks to,106
NA,them.,106
NA,But I also want to point out that the people,106
NA,of Lingiari had a very good reason not to,106
NA,vote for the government. Part of that was our,106
NA,positive plan and vision for Northern Austra-,106
NA,lia. It is clear that they wanted major im-,106
NA,provements in infrastructure. They wanted,106
NA,and still want the government to keep Telstra,106
NA,in majority public ownership and to force,106
NA,Telstra to focus on the telecommunications,106
NA,needs of remote towns and communities.,106
NA,Again I will juxtapose my electorate with,106
NA,the member for Wentworth's. The telecom-,106
NA,munications difficulties that confront people,106
NA,who live in remote Australia are probably,106
NA,incomprehensible to most of the electors of,106
NA,Wentworth. I think this is a problem the Lib-,106
NA,eral Party has. It is clear that The Nationals,106
NA,understand the implications of this proposed,106
NA,sale of Telstra and are concerned about it. It,106
NA,is a fact that individuals from cockies corner,106
NA,who are members of that party have been,106
NA,brave enough to stand up and say on a num-,106
NA,"ber of occasions to the party, ‘We don't want",106
NA,you to pursue the full sale of Telstra.' I will,106
NA,be pushing that issue strongly. Whilst the,106
NA,government can argue all it likes about what,106
NA,"it believes its mandate might be, I know the",106
NA,directions I have from the people of Lin-,106
NA,giari-and they are to oppose vehemently,106
NA,the further sale of Telstra.,106
NA,"Of course, there are other significant is-",106
NA,"sues, such as the shocking state of the Terri-",106
NA,tory's roads. I have raised that in this cham-,106
NA,"ber on many occasions, and I will not go",106
NA,through the details of it now. I will just note,106
NA,"that the previous speaker in this place, the",106
NA,"member for Parkes, was talking about the",106
NA,statements made about government pork-,106
NA,barrelling. Let me be very clear that the,107
NA,funding for roads through the last parliament,107
NA,was skewed monumentally towards govern-,107
NA,"ment electorates. My own electorate, which",107
NA,"arguably has the worst roads in Australia,",107
NA,was very underresourced in comparison to,107
NA,those other electorates-and I name particu-,107
NA,"larly the member for Gwydir's electorate,",107
NA,because under the Roads to Recovery pro-,107
NA,gram an electorate one-tenth the size of the,107
NA,seat of Lingiari received over twice the fund-,107
NA,ing for roads. There are in the seat of Lin-,107
NA,"giari 9,000 kilometres of roads on unincorpo-",107
NA,"rated land-dirt roads that link small, re-",107
NA,"mote, isolated communities, and at many",107
NA,"times during the year, particularly in the wet",107
NA,"season, many of these communities cannot",107
NA,use the roads. This compounds the cost of,107
NA,living in these places and places an addi-,107
NA,tional burden on the communities. This is not,107
NA,something the government has thought,107
NA,"through, and I maintain the view that this has",107
NA,been an exercise in pork-barrelling. The,107
NA,funding has been skewed. The government,107
NA,"has used the formula, but the funding has",107
NA,been skewed monumentally towards gov-,107
NA,ernment electorates-principally National,107
NA,Party electorates.,107
NA,Then there is the neglect of public health,107
NA,and bulk-billing. Mr Deputy Speaker,107
NA,"Beazley, you live in a very fine city. I imag-",107
NA,ine that you could drive from your home and,107
NA,within five or six kilometres come to a bulk-,107
NA,billing doctor. In my electorate of 1.4 million,107
NA,"square kilometres, there is only one private",107
NA,bulk-billing medical practice in the top end,107
NA,of the Territory. We pay the highest fees for,107
NA,consultations of anywhere in Australia. The,107
NA,average consultation fee is $52. The minister,107
NA,for health and the government come in here,107
NA,saying what they are doing for the bush. I,107
NA,can tell you what they are not doing: they are,107
NA,not delivering accessible health services-,107
NA,and parents are choosing not to take their,107
NA,children or themselves to the doctor because,107
NA,"they simply cannot afford it, because they do",107
NA,not have access to bulk-billing private medi-,107
NA,cal practices. That is another reason why the,107
NA,community was not going to vote for the,107
NA,government and was pleased to support me.,107
NA,"Then there is the question of schools, both",107
NA,"public and private, being resourced at a level",107
NA,which will give kids in the Northern Terri-,107
NA,tory the same learning opportunities as those,107
NA,enjoyed by other Australian children. I will,107
NA,address that issue in another debate in this,107
NA,place which is coming up in the next day or,107
NA,"so, because the absolute disadvantage suf-",107
NA,fered by Indigenous Territorians in terms of,107
NA,public education is largely a direct result of,107
NA,the neglect of governments. I want to make a,107
NA,point about the member for Goldstein's con-,107
NA,tribution earlier today. I know we are not,107
NA,allowed to interject during members' first,107
NA,"speeches, but his very simplistic analysis of",107
NA,the concerns of Indigenous Australia and the,107
NA,need for public policy in Indigenous Austra-,107
NA,lia needs some detailed comment. If I do not,107
NA,"have time today, at some later point I will",107
NA,address that in great detail. What it demon-,107
NA,strated was the sort of ignorance that is per-,107
NA,petrated by the conservatives in this country,107
NA,about the state of Indigenous affairs. His,107
NA,comment was-and it is worth while reading,107
NA,this bit:,107
NA,The chilling fact is that the very fabric of a proud,107
NA,"and fascinating culture, many thousands of years",107
NA,"in the making, has been brought to its knees in",107
NA,less than 30 years by well-intentioned but seri-,107
NA,ously misguided policy.,107
NA,"I do not know where this bloke comes from,",107
NA,but he is clearly ignorant of Australian his-,107
NA,tory and has no understanding of the history,107
NA,"of Australian public policy, of the concerns",107
NA,and aspirations of Indigenous Australians or,107
NA,of what they have been saying to successive,107
NA,governments over the last 30 years. If he had,107
NA,"any knowledge whatsoever, he would say",107
NA,that the reason these people are in such dire,107
NA,poverty is not only because of poor public,107
NA,policy but also because of the failure to ac-,108
NA,cept the legitimate demands made by Indige-,108
NA,nous Australians on the Australian commu-,108
NA,nity to have their citizenship rights recog-,108
NA,nised. One of the real problems is that those,108
NA,citizenship rights are not properly recog-,108
NA,"nised. In many parts of Australia, and cer-",108
NA,"tainly in my own electorate, where there is a",108
NA,"$850 million shortage of housing in the bush,",108
NA,"where people live 20 or 30 people to a home,",108
NA,and where there are no high schools or em-,108
NA,"ployment opportunities, people like the",108
NA,member for Goldstein choose to blame the,108
NA,"victims. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure you",108
NA,understand that that is a foolish way to go.,108
NA,I lastly want to address very quickly the,108
NA,question of the redistribution. We had a re-,108
NA,"distribution before the last election, and it",108
NA,was said that the seat of Lingiari and the seat,108
NA,of Solomon would need to be combined into,108
NA,one seat. As a result of an inquiry by the,108
NA,Joint Committee on Electoral Matters in this,108
NA,"place, it was agreed to make a recommenda-",108
NA,tion that they should look at the way in,108
NA,which the quota was applied to ensure that,108
NA,the Northern Territory would maintain two,108
NA,seats for the last election. I have had the,108
NA,liamentary Library look at the result of the,108
NA,election and what the determination might be,108
NA,for any future redistribution based on the,108
NA,projected population figures for June 2005.,108
NA,"Sadly, we have something which deeply con-",108
NA,cerns me and will come as no surprise be-,108
NA,"cause, on the population figures that are be-",108
NA,"ing estimated, we will again be facing the",108
NA,prospect of one seat for the whole of the,108
NA,Northern Territory. That will be a tragedy. I,108
NA,note that the member for Solomon is not in,108
NA,"the chamber, but let me make it very clear to",108
NA,"him that, on the basis of the last election, if",108
NA,you combined the votes of the seats of,108
NA,Solomon and Lingiari I would still be the,108
NA,member for the Northern Territory and the,108
NA,member for Solomon would not be gracing,108
NA,us with his presence.,108
NA,Mr Kelvin Thomson interjecting-,108
Mr SNOWDON,That is right. If we go,108
NA,"back to one seat, I anticipate he will not be",108
NA,"here. So I imagine the government members,",108
NA,"and not least the member for Solomon, will",108
NA,be considering ways in which they can se-,108
NA,cure the two seats. The only way I think they,108
NA,can do it is to guarantee by legislation that,108
NA,the Northern Territory has a minimum of two,108
NA,"seats. That is the only way. In my view, they",108
NA,"cannot validly argue, using the criteria which",108
NA,"are established under the electoral act, that",108
NA,we can fiddle with the statistics in a way,108
NA,"which could give us two seats, even though",108
NA,we have grave concerns about the accuracy,108
NA,of that data.,108
NA,I want to place on the record my deep,108
NA,concern that the possibility of us going back,108
NA,to one seat is really on the agenda. That is,108
NA,something that should challenge the minds of,108
NA,the people of the Northern Territory and in-,108
NA,deed the Northern Territory government-,108
NA,which I am sure it will. I can imagine the,108
NA,member for Solomon ferreting away to make,108
NA,sure that he can maintain the two seats. I,108
NA,"want the two seats, but I am not afraid of",108
NA,"Pargoing back to one seat because, if we go",108
NA,"back to one seat, there will be one member",108
NA,"here, and it will not be him.",108
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,108
Mr SNOWDON,I am pleased to see,108
NA,that I have the support of my colleagues. I,108
NA,am glad they are here. Normally they would,108
NA,not front. I stood up to give this speech and I,108
NA,was applauded. I have come in here and I,108
NA,have a crowd. The gallery is almost full. I,108
NA,have come in here and they are back to sup-,108
NA,port me again. That is a great privilege.,108
NA,(Time expired),108
The SPEAKER,Order! Before I call the,108
NA,"honourable member for Prospect, I remind",108
NA,honourable members that this is his first,108
NA,speech. I therefore ask that the usual courte-,108
NA,sies be extended to him.,108
Mr BOWEN ,Prospect) (6.08 p.m.)-,109
NA,From the high rises of Fairfield to the farms,109
NA,"of Kemps Creek, Prospect is a diverse and",109
NA,exciting community. It is the community that,109
NA,"I grew up in, and it has given me enormous",109
NA,opportunities. It is an honour to represent my,109
NA,community in this House as the third mem-,109
NA,ber for Prospect.,109
NA,In 1788 Captain Arthur Phillip and Watkin,109
NA,Tench stood on a hill west of the settlement,109
NA,at Sydney Cove. They agreed that the area,109
NA,that they could see from the hill was fertile,109
NA,"and had good prospects. Accordingly, the hill",109
NA,and the region that they surveyed came to be,109
NA,known as Prospect. Governor Phillip was,109
NA,"right about the area having good prospects,",109
NA,but I am sure he would not recognise the,109
NA,multicultural city that has developed in its,109
NA,fields. Families who have lived in Prospect,109
NA,for six generations have welcomed recent,109
NA,arrivals who have struggled over oceans to,109
NA,get here and make our area their home.,109
NA,It is appropriate tonight,109
NA,"to the second member for Prospect, the Hon.",109
NA,Janice Crosio. Janice was a larger than life,109
NA,figure in our electorate. She had a remark-,109
NA,able knack of reading the mood of her con-,109
NA,stituents and representing their views here in,109
NA,"Canberra with a loud, booming voice to",109
NA,make sure that they were heard. I am not,109
NA,"Janice Crosio, and I will not attempt to be. I",109
NA,am a different person with a different style.,109
NA,But if I can read the views of the electorate,109
NA,and represent their views here as well as she,109
NA,"did over so many years, I will be doing well",109
NA,as a member of this place.,109
NA,I thank the people of Prospect for their,109
NA,support on 9 October. I said all through the,109
NA,campaign that I did not take their support for,109
NA,granted and that I would be treating the seat,109
NA,like it was marginal. This was not spin and it,109
NA,"remains my approach. I do not, and never",109
NA,"will, take the support of the people of Pros-",109
NA,"pect for granted, and I will be working to",109
NA,retain and increase their support over the,109
NA,coming years.,109
NA,I thank the men and women of Labor-the,109
NA,"members of Fairfield, Greystanes, Smithfield",109
NA,and St Clair Colyton branches who worked,109
NA,"hard on election day, many of them all day. I",109
NA,am sure the House will not mind me ac-,109
NA,knowledging just a few people who worked,109
NA,above and beyond the call of duty in the,109
NA,"lead-up to the campaign: Rolando Atienza,",109
NA,"Rodolfo Dimitui, Ninos Khoshaba, Bill",109
NA,"Dumbrell, Gino Coeira, Tim MCPhail, Jim",109
NA,Hanna and Albert Mooshi. I also thank the,109
NA,senior vice-president of the New South,109
NA,"Wales branch of the ALP, Bernie Riordan,",109
NA,"the general secretary, Mark Arbib, and John",109
NA,"Azarias, Paul Binsted and Gabbie Trainor for",109
NA,their support. My gratitude also goes to some,109
NA,of my new colleagues who lent me advice,109
NA,and assistance. I thank the Leader of the Op-,109
NA,"position, the members for Barton, Perth,",109
NA,"Lilley, Hunter, Fowler and Chifley and also",109
NA,that I pay tribute Senator Conroy.,109
NA,My involvement in politics did not begin,109
NA,when the six-week campaign began. I joined,109
NA,the Labor Party 17 years ago and was elected,109
NA,"to Fairfield Council in 1995. Over that time,",109
NA,there were three people in particular who,109
NA,have taken every opportunity to support me,109
NA,and to urge me on to eventually become the,109
NA,member for Prospect. I did not need much,109
NA,"urging. However, I do very much appreciate",109
NA,"the support of Anwar Khoshaba, Claro Cruz",109
NA,and Carl Scully. Three more fiercely loyal,109
NA,individuals you could not hope to meet. An-,109
NA,war Khoshaba will not mind me saying that,109
NA,he often drives me to distraction with his,109
NA,"views on many issues, but I will always ap-",109
NA,preciate his passionate loyalty to me. The,109
NA,Hon. Carl Scully has also been a constant,109
NA,supporter and confidant over those years. I,109
NA,had the pleasure of being his chief of staff,109
NA,for the last four years. He knows the stresses,109
NA,and strains on somebody who hopes to repre-,109
NA,sent their area in parliament. He has been a,109
NA,"great friend and supporter, and I am glad he",110
NA,could join us in the gallery tonight.,110
NA,"In politics, as in life, personal friends",110
NA,provide emotional sustenance in the bad,110
NA,times and share the joy in the good times. I,110
NA,have been fortunate to have a group of,110
NA,friends who have been a wonderful support.,110
NA,It is an honour to call them friends. Some of,110
NA,"them are political, some very definitely are",110
NA,not. Tonight in my first contribution to this,110
NA,"House, I would like to place on record my",110
NA,"thanks to Chris Russell, Brent and Tessa",110
NA,"Thomas, Charlie Monti, Greg Lozelle,",110
NA,"Robert, Peter Presdee, Chris Minns, Anna",110
NA,Collins and Matt Brown.,110
NA,"In addition, there is one other friend I",110
NA,would like to mention. For many years I,110
NA,shared my hopes and aspirations with Ed,110
NA,"Husic. We compared notes, we shared disap-",110
NA,"pointments, we celebrated victories and we",110
NA,helped each other. We debated policies and,110
NA,we incubated ideas to improve the lot of,110
NA,Western Sydney. My one regret tonight is,110
NA,that he listens from the gallery and not from,110
NA,the chamber. He will one day join us in this,110
NA,"parliament, and Australia will be the better",110
NA,for his contribution.,110
NA,I of course want to make mention tonight,110
NA,of my parents. Ross and Christine Bowen,110
NA,taught me many things. They taught me not,110
NA,by lessons or homilies but simply by exam-,110
NA,"ple. They taught me to avoid pretension, to",110
NA,work hard and to do what I believe to be,110
NA,"right, regardless of the personal conse-",110
NA,"quences. They tell me they are proud of me,",110
NA,and tonight I tell the House that I am proud,110
NA,of them.,110
NA,The final person I want to mention tonight,110
NA,"is my wife, Rebecca. We met at a New South",110
NA,"Wales conference of the Labor Party, but our",110
NA,life has grown to encompass so much more,110
NA,than politics. She has been a wonderful sup-,110
NA,porter. We are now building a house together,110
NA,"in Smithfield, at the foot of Prospect Hill,",110
NA,and we are soon to bring a little girl into the,110
NA,world. Rebecca has supported my aspirations,110
NA,"can in every way possible, and I am looking for-",110
NA,ward to spending the rest of my life with her.,110
NA,"As a new Labor member of this House, I",110
NA,see my role as being a voice for the people,110
NA,who have no other voice in the national po-,110
NA,litical debate. Australia is one of a small,110
NA,number of states throughout the world that is,110
NA,constituted as a Commonwealth. The term,110
NA,‘Commonwealth' was chosen not only to,110
NA,represent that the government was based on,110
NA,the common consent of the people but also to,110
NA,represent those almost unique Australian,110
NA,attributes of fairness and tolerance.,110
NA,I welcome the debate on moral values in,110
NA,this House and across the country. I am,110
NA,happy to stand behind the moral values of,110
NA,"fairness and tolerance, and to argue for them",110
NA,vigorously. I say this about the morals de-,110
NA,bate: bring it on. It is not enough to talk,110
NA,about family values. Fixing things like the,110
NA,"family debt trap, and providing more incen-",110
NA,"tives for people to go from welfare to work,",110
NA,are important too. I am happy to argue that,110
NA,"we can be, and must be, an efficient and",110
NA,modern economy which still has fairness and,110
NA,tolerance as the basis of our Commonwealth.,110
NA,We can be a productive economy which has,110
NA,protections built in for people who have been,110
NA,unfairly dismissed. We can be a nation that,110
NA,trades successfully with different nations,110
NA,"across the world, but that does not mean we",110
NA,cannot stand up and be counted against,110
NA,abuses of human rights.,110
NA,"We need to create more wealth, and we",110
NA,need to share it fairly amongst the people,110
NA,who have contributed to its creation. I have,110
NA,long had a policy interest in wealth creation,110
NA,through Australia becoming a leading-edge,110
NA,country in the field of research and develop-,110
NA,ment. Between 1983 and 1994 our national,110
NA,levels of research and development trebled.,110
NA,"In the decade prior to that, research and de-",110
NA,"velopment had been declining, and our levels",111
NA,of R&D are only now returning to the levels,111
NA,that we had when the Keating government,111
NA,lost office. The increase in R&D during the,111
NA,Hawke and Keating years did not just hap-,111
NA,pen. This is one example of where govern-,111
NA,ment programs can have a remarkable im-,111
NA,pact. The 150 per cent research and devel-,111
NA,opment concession and the R&D syndication,111
NA,program had a real benefit and a beneficial,111
NA,impact on our levels of research; but more,111
NA,"than that, they had a real impact on our",111
NA,economy. We can strengthen our trading po-,111
NA,"sition, embracing high value added goods",111
NA,that cushion us against future downturns in,111
NA,our terms of trade.,111
NA,I am always amazed by the skills the Aus-,111
NA,tralian people possess. There is absolutely no,111
NA,reason why we cannot compete with any,111
NA,other country in the world when it comes to,111
NA,our technological skills. Australian research,111
NA,has traditionally been very strong in the,111
NA,fields of environmental science and biology.,111
NA,This stands us in good stead to capitalise on,111
NA,the growth in the emerging field of biotech-,111
NA,nology. I fear that an ideological culture that,111
NA,opposes government involvement in the,111
NA,economy may see us miss many more oppor-,111
NA,tunities in this field. We need to support our,111
NA,universities as they incubate talent and ideas.,111
NA,Recently I was concerned to read of an,111
NA,"idea floated by the Minister for Education,",111
NA,Science and Training to establish universities,111
NA,without research departments. A university is,111
NA,not there just to communicate knowledge; it,111
NA,is there to create knowledge. It is there to,111
NA,foster a culture of innovation and excellence,111
NA,in the national interest. And that is not just,111
NA,our traditional universities in the capital,111
NA,ies. Some of the best research universities in,111
NA,the world are not in the capital cities but in,111
NA,the regions. Good research at universities,111
NA,that can be considered amongst the best in,111
NA,the world is not some elite distraction from,111
NA,the main game of the economy; it is essential,111
NA,"for a modern, cutting-edge economy, which",111
NA,Australia can become.,111
NA,I represent an area of blueand white-,111
NA,"collar workers, farmers and small business",111
NA,people. This nation's industrial relations pol-,111
NA,"icy must strike a balance between a modern,",111
NA,highly productive economy and protection,111
NA,for people who are in an unequal bargaining,111
NA,position with their employer-people strug-,111
NA,gling to find a voice. What we have seen,111
NA,introduced into the industrial relations sys-,111
NA,tem over the last eight years has not always,111
NA,"meant more choice. I have seen, first-hand,",111
NA,levels of intimidation and an unequal bar-,111
NA,gaining system which does not promote a,111
NA,more productive and cooperative Australia. I,111
NA,support a decentralised bargaining system,111
NA,"that empowers the enterprise-it was, after",111
NA,"all, Labor which pioneered this approach-",111
NA,but it must be the enterprise that is empow-,111
NA,"ered, and not one half of the bargaining unit",111
NA,over the other.,111
NA,I mentioned earlier that I represent in this,111
NA,House many small business owners. In the,111
NA,"12 months leading up to the election, I door-",111
NA,"knocked nearly 10,000 houses throughout",111
NA,"my electorate. Of course, in that project I",111
NA,came across many small business people.,111
NA,Small business people are working families,111
NA,struggling just like any other working family.,111
NA,Not one small business owner raised with me,111
NA,the need to provide them with an exemption,111
NA,from the unfair dismissal laws. None of them,111
NA,"said to me, ‘Can I please have the power to",111
NA,"sack somebody unfairly?' However, many",111
NA,raised with me the need to reduce the oner-,111
NA,ous burden of the GST and other paperwork,111
NA,compliance costs. They also raised with me,111
NA,citthe need for support in their dealings with,111
NA,franchisers and landlords. Many small busi-,111
NA,ness owners find themselves in unequal bar-,111
NA,"gaining positions, just like other members of",111
NA,the work force. I include small business peo-,111
NA,ple in the category of people struggling to,111
NA,find a voice in the national debate. I will be,111
NA,paying particular attention to the interests,112
NA,and aspirations of small business people dur-,112
NA,ing my time in this House.,112
NA,Inequity is not just a matter of economics.,112
NA,"As mayor of Fairfield, and then as president",112
NA,of the Western Sydney Regional Organisa-,112
NA,"tion of Councils, I spent a lot of time dealing",112
NA,with the concept of ‘place'. A community,112
NA,can have its spirit lifted and its quality of,112
NA,improved by an effort to improve its urban,112
NA,environment. We often hear of our more af-,112
NA,"fluent areas being described as ‘leafy', but",112
NA,there is no reason why an area that could,112
NA,never be described as ‘affluent' should not be,112
NA,described as ‘leafy'. There is no reason why,112
NA,our public spaces and shopping centres can-,112
NA,"not be places for cultural enrichment, instead",112
NA,of unattractive and barren wastelands. Our,112
NA,experience in Cabramatta has shown that the,112
NA,urban environment is important. Law en-,112
NA,forcement experts have said that the work of,112
NA,Fairfield council in improving place man-,112
NA,agement and the urban amenity has been a,112
NA,vital factor in reducing crime in Cabramatta.,112
NA,"Of course, it was not this alone that reduced",112
NA,crime: a very significant police effort has,112
NA,been the main focus. But the Australian peo-,112
NA,ple have consistently identified law and or-,112
NA,"der as their major concern, and any steps",112
NA,which make a contribution to reducing crime,112
NA,must be welcomed.,112
NA,I do not regard this as exclusively a matter,112
NA,for local government. I believe that state and,112
NA,federal governments can do more when it,112
NA,comes to the urban environment. When I was,112
NA,"mayor, I saw first-hand how much can be",112
NA,achieved with a relatively small outlay of,112
NA,"money, but I also saw how hard it is, for a",112
NA,council struggling with so many commit-,112
NA,"ments, to find that money. This nation des-",112
NA,perately needs the re-establishment of a fed-,112
NA,eral department of urban affairs and a return,112
NA,"to federal involvement in urban affairs, along",112
NA,the lines of the previous government's suc-,112
NA,cessful Better Cities Program.,112
NA,As to being a voice for those without a,112
NA,"voice, I believe a particular obligation falls",112
NA,on me-along with my friend the honourable,112
NA,member for Fowler-as the representative of,112
NA,the most culturally diverse area in Australia.,112
NA,Members of various cultural groups who,112
NA,have settled in the seat of Prospect have,112
NA,taught me more than any textbook ever could,112
NA,life about the preciousness of human rights. To,112
NA,talk to someone who has had all three of his,112
NA,daughters executed gives you a very keen,112
NA,appreciation of the need to take a robust ap-,112
NA,proach to human rights. A breach of human,112
NA,rights anywhere is an attack on human rights,112
NA,everywhere. To paraphrase Elie Wiesel:,112
NA,when human rights are under attack we must,112
NA,"interfere. As an opposition backbencher, I do",112
NA,not have any illusions that I will be able to,112
NA,make a great material difference in this re-,112
NA,"gard. However, I do want to make this one",112
NA,pledge: I will never be silent. Quiet and dip-,112
NA,lomatic representations in the corridors of,112
NA,the House will sometimes be the most ap-,112
NA,propriate way of dealing with a matter. At,112
NA,"other times, perhaps, a louder approach will",112
NA,"be necessary. Either way, I will not be silent.",112
NA,Members of all religions or philosophies,112
NA,should be able to practise their beliefs in,112
NA,freedom. I include in this a group like Falun,112
NA,"Gong, which has as its creed truth, forbear-",112
NA,ance and tolerance. They do not deserve to,112
NA,be tortured for espousing such basic beliefs,112
NA,as these. I will not be silent on the unspeak-,112
NA,able suffering and heartache that is occurring,112
NA,in the Darfur region of Sudan. This suffering,112
NA,receives almost no attention in the Australian,112
NA,media but it is the biggest humanitarian crisis,112
NA,of the last 10 years. In an area as large as,112
NA,"France, 70,000 human beings have lost their",112
NA,"lives to a combination of hunger, disease and",112
NA,murder. If an event even 10 per cent as hor-,112
NA,rendous as this occurred in a Western country,112
NA,we would see massive coverage and massive,112
NA,action from the governments of the world.,112
NA,Recently in Prospect we have received our,113
NA,latest round of migration refugees from the,113
NA,Sudan. It gives me an enormous sense of,113
NA,pride as I walk around Fairfield to see small,113
NA,Sudanese children in the uniforms of Fair-,113
NA,field Primary School. These children have,113
NA,endured far more in their little lives than,113
NA,most of us will have to endure if we live to,113
NA,"old age. Yet, they are relatively lucky; hun-",113
NA,dreds of thousands of others are not. I will,113
NA,not be silent on human rights in places like,113
NA,Vietnam or Myanmar or anywhere else in the,113
NA,world. To have somebody imprisoned for a,113
NA,crime of ‘disrespecting democratic freedoms',113
NA,for expressing their democratic view is,113
NA,something I can never be silent about. I be-,113
NA,lieve Australia and individual members of,113
NA,this House need to keep open the lines of,113
NA,communication with the governments of all,113
NA,nations. But we must have human rights as,113
NA,our highest priority in these discussions. As a,113
NA,nation we must say: ‘Here we stand; we can,113
NA,do no other.',113
NA,When my time in this House comes to an,113
NA,end I hope it will be judged to have been a,113
NA,success. The definition of success that I will,113
NA,be applying when I come to judge my time in,113
NA,this House is one that was written a long,113
NA,"time ago by Ralph Waldo Emerson, who was",113
NA,at one stage Chaplain of the House of Repre-,113
NA,sentatives of another commonwealth-that,113
NA,of Massachusetts. These are words that I,113
NA,have found inspiring for a long time and I,113
NA,would like to share them with the House to-,113
NA,night:,113
NA,To laugh often and much; to win the respect of,113
NA,intelligent people and the affection of children; to,113
NA,earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure,113
NA,the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty;,113
NA,to find the best in others; to leave the world,113
NA,"better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch",113
NA,or a redeemed social condition; to know that even,113
NA,one life has breathed easier because you have,113
NA,lived. This is to have succeeded.,113
NA,This is the test that I will apply to myself,113
NA,when my time in this House comes to an,113
NA,end. I thank the House for its courtesy.,113
The SPEAKER,Order! Before I call the,113
NA,"honourable member for Hasluck, I remind",113
NA,honourable members that this is his first,113
NA,speech. I therefore ask that the usual courte-,113
NA,sies be extended to him.,113
Mr HENRY ,Hasluck) (6.26 p.m.)-The,113
NA,word ‘privilege' is often used too easily. But,113
NA,"as I sat down to write this first speech, and",113
NA,"now as I stand here to deliver it, I can think",113
NA,"of no better word. If it is, as I believe, a",113
NA,"privilege to be an Australian citizen, I am",113
NA,deeply conscious of what a privilege it is to,113
NA,be elected to our parliament. So it is with,113
NA,great pride and gratitude that I embark on my,113
NA,new role representing the community that,113
NA,my family and I have called home for 20,113
NA,"years, and which our electoral system now",113
NA,calls the seat of Hasluck. In my sense of,113
NA,gratitude my thoughts have turned to many,113
NA,of the people who have contributed to my,113
NA,"presence here today. First of all, may I pay",113
NA,tribute to the family and to all of the values,113
NA,associated with it in Australian life. In par-,113
NA,"ticular, I pay tribute to my family. My ever-",113
NA,lasting appreciation goes to my late parents,113
NA,for their support and for their many sacrifices,113
NA,in bringing into this world my two brothers,113
NA,and me. I wish they could all be here today,113
NA,as I know that they would be bursting with,113
NA,"pride. Sadly, my mother passed away less",113
NA,than one year ago.,113
NA,This memory provides some poignancy as,113
NA,I stand here today in Parliament House. Over,113
NA,"62 years ago, as a young, vibrant woman, my",113
NA,mother worked in Canberra as a typist in the,113
NA,"a bit Attorney-General's Department. My father,",113
NA,like very many young men and women of the,113
NA,"time, left school and enlisted to serve his",113
NA,"country. During that time of war, he experi-",113
NA,"enced being torpedoed off Cyprus, being",113
NA,wounded by a landmine in Borneo and he,113
NA,suffered his share of hardships in New,114
NA,"Guinea. My father was uncomplaining, in",114
NA,spite of his experiences. He got on with the,114
NA,job of securing a future for himself and his,114
NA,young family. He and my mother were typi-,114
NA,cal of their time. They were both committed,114
NA,to ensuring that their three sons had the best,114
NA,opportunities in education and life-perhaps,114
NA,that is something that I did not fully appreciand,114
NA,ate at the time. With commitment and persis-,114
NA,tence my father's ambition to be a solicitor,114
NA,was realised after he achieved the age of 50.,114
NA,"For me, his efforts have been a guiding light.",114
NA,His commitment and persistence-those,114
NA,qualities of never giving up-have also sus-,114
NA,tained me in the course of my life. I also rec-,114
NA,ognise the wonderful influence of my two,114
NA,"brothers, Robert and Keith, in shaping my",114
NA,"early life and, more recently, in shaping their",114
NA,respective families.,114
NA,I am also sincerely thankful for the sup-,114
NA,port of many people who gave freely of their,114
NA,"time, expertise, experience and kindness",114
NA,from preselection and along the path to elec-,114
NA,tion. There are too many people to thank,114
NA,them all in this speech but I must specifically,114
NA,"mention Helen Leslie, who gave so selflessly",114
NA,of her time and energy for several long,114
NA,months. My campaign committee were sec-,114
NA,"ond to none, led by Barry MACKinnon and",114
NA,"ably supported by Andrew Reynolds, Helen",114
NA,"Morton, Graeme Harris, Nick Braining, Sue",114
NA,"Wood, Heather Gilmour, Norm Haywood",114
NA,and Peter Stewart. I send a very special thank,114
NA,you to the many helpers-some 400-on,114
NA,election day and all those from the Hasluck,114
NA,division for their support.,114
NA,A real stalwart was Senator elect Judith,114
NA,"Adams, who worked tirelessly for many",114
NA,months on my behalf. Senator Alan,114
NA,"Eggleston, as patron senator for Hasluck,",114
NA,was also available to lend an ear and provide,114
NA,"practical support. Thank you, Alan. Thanks",114
NA,also to Senators Ellison and Campbell for,114
NA,their support and encouragement during the,114
NA,course of the campaign and a special thanks,114
NA,"to Senator Ross Lightfoot, who encouraged",114
NA,me to throw my hat in the ring and run for,114
NA,"preselection, for his ongoing support.",114
NA,"Most of all, however, my gratitude and my",114
NA,sense of living a truly privileged life is al-,114
NA,"ways due to my four wonderful daughters,",114
NA,"Nellandra, Hannah, Harriette and Hillary,",114
NA,"the love of my life, Mary, my wife. I am",114
NA,pleased to acknowledge them in the gallery,114
NA,today. The path to standing here as a member,114
NA,of parliament would have been very different,114
NA,"indeed without their generosity of spirit, un-",114
NA,failing support and invaluable sense of hu-,114
NA,mour.,114
NA,The seat of Hasluck lies to the east of,114
NA,"Perth, encompassing a unique mix of outer",114
NA,metropolitan suburbs. Hasluck first became a,114
NA,federal seat at the 2001 election and was,114
NA,named after the highly respected and influen-,114
NA,tial Liberals Sir Paul and Dame Alexandra,114
NA,Hasluck. Dame Alexandra was a noted histo-,114
NA,rian and Sir Paul succeeded in several ca-,114
NA,"reers, including as a journalist, diplomat,",114
NA,"academic and bureaucrat, before being",114
NA,elected as a federal member of parliament in,114
NA,1949. During his time in successive Menzies',114
NA,governments he held the portfolios of Terri-,114
NA,"tories, Defence and External Affairs. The",114
NA,Haslucks were known to people of all politi-,114
NA,cal persuasions as deeply intelligent and,114
NA,compassionate people.,114
NA,Sir Paul was appointed Governor-General,114
NA,in 1969 and served until 1974. His standing,114
NA,in public life and his reputation was as a,114
NA,"well-informed, thoughtful man of enormous",114
NA,integrity. He is fondly remembered by all,114
NA,who knew him in and out of parliament and,114
NA,on both sides of the House. These themes of,114
NA,contribution to the local and national com-,114
NA,munities in which I belong and of honour-,114
NA,able partisanship within the Liberal Party are,114
NA,aspirations for my own service in parliament.,114
NA,If my contribution can be even a fraction of,114
NA,that of the Haslucks I will be very proud in-,115
NA,deed.,115
NA,The part of the nation I am here to repre-,115
NA,sent is in many ways a true microcosm of,115
NA,Australia. It reaches from the hills suburbs of,115
NA,"Lesmurdie, Kalamunda and Gooseberry Hill",115
NA,north-west to the historic township of Mid-,115
NA,land and Guildford and south to the newer,115
NA,city of Gosnells. It encompasses rural and,115
NA,"semirural communities, industrial hubs of",115
NA,"yesterday and today, vital transport indus-",115
NA,"tries, tourism, hospitality, vineyards, or-",115
NA,chards and market gardens. People from over,115
NA,70 different countries and nationalities live in,115
NA,both charming older residential suburbs un-,115
NA,dergoing rejuvenation and a wide range of,115
NA,newer residential developments. It is a seat,115
NA,blessed with several important conservation,115
NA,"areas, including national parks and state for-",115
NA,"ests, many of Western Australia's most im-",115
NA,portant wetlands and both the major water-,115
NA,ways for Perth-the Canning and Perth's,115
NA,"signature river, the Swan, flow through Has-",115
NA,luck.,115
NA,Before the election campaign started I,115
NA,spent almost a year meeting and listening to,115
NA,as many members of the Hasluck community,115
NA,as I could. Devoting myself to this gave me a,115
NA,wonderful opportunity to learn what my,115
NA,community's hopes and concerns really,115
NA,were. People told me of their worries for,115
NA,"their businesses, for their children's educa-",115
NA,"tion, for their health care, for their safety",115
NA,for their environment. Of particular concern,115
NA,to me were the numbers of people who had,115
NA,found the public sector unresponsive in,115
NA,meeting or addressing their needs. While,115
NA,many of the issues raised were in a personal,115
NA,"context, there were many local community",115
NA,"examples where concerns for health, welfare",115
NA,and safety appeared to be ignored. I would,115
NA,like to refer to some of these.,115
NA,The Kalamunda District Community Hos-,115
NA,pital is an example. Over 95 per cent of the,115
NA,residents of the serviced area wish to retain,115
NA,maternity and obstetric services at this hospi-,115
NA,tal. It has an exemplary health and safety,115
NA,"record, and I am committed to supporting it",115
NA,and the community's efforts to retain the full,115
NA,range of services currently delivered. Other,115
NA,issues include safe school crossings for Wat-,115
NA,tle Grove and Helena primary schools and,115
NA,ablution blocks for Gosnells and High Wy-,115
NA,"combe primary schools, just to mention a",115
NA,few. In raising some of these concerns it is,115
NA,important that I also mention the wonderful,115
NA,job being done by so many volunteers on,115
NA,"P&C committees, in welfare organisations,",115
NA,in community care groups and in sporting,115
NA,organisations. These volunteers and these,115
NA,organisations make our communities what,115
NA,they are today.,115
NA,"Like Sir Paul Hasluck, I too have enjoyed",115
NA,a diverse career before this new role. I began,115
NA,my working life as a jackeroo and went on to,115
NA,gain unforgettable experiences working on,115
NA,"farming properties in New South Wales,",115
NA,Queensland and Western Australia and in the,115
NA,agricultural industry in general. I then was,115
NA,fortunate to have opportunities to work in the,115
NA,"construction industry, establishing my own",115
NA,building and concrete-drilling and sawing,115
NA,"company, which in turn led to me becoming",115
NA,involved in a company developing oilfield,115
NA,production technology in the USA.,115
NA,For the past 18 years I have been working,115
NA,and in the building and construction sector with,115
NA,the Master Plumbers and Mechanical Ser-,115
NA,"vices Association and the Master Painters,",115
NA,"Decorators and Signwriters Association, rep-",115
NA,resenting the needs of their respective mem-,115
NA,berships. This has involved me in the devel-,115
NA,"opment of the plumbing industry at state,",115
NA,national and global levels. I have gained,115
NA,"enormously from these experiences, which",115
NA,have included establishing an award-winning,115
NA,"industry based vocational training centre,",115
NA,creating public-private partnerships to pro-,115
NA,mote water and energy efficiency strategies,115
NA,for our communities and playing a key role,116
NA,in industry reform. I have enjoyed over 40,116
NA,years working in and with small business.,116
NA,"Far more than being a privilege, being a",116
NA,member of parliament is a responsibility-a,116
NA,responsibility to contribute to the future of,116
NA,"our nation, a responsibility not to be squan-",116
NA,dered. There are many challenges facing the,116
NA,Australian community at the beginning of,116
NA,the 21st century. I hope to contribute posi-,116
NA,tively to as many of these as I can. I wish to,116
NA,take this opportunity to raise those important,116
NA,issues particularly close to my heart: the,116
NA,challenge of how we manage our water re-,116
NA,sources for future generations and the chal-,116
NA,lenge of how we skill and train ourselves and,116
NA,our people for the future world of work.,116
NA,I will start with water. The world has only,116
NA,the same amount of water as it did at the be-,116
NA,"ginning of human civilisation, but now our",116
NA,global population is approaching six billion.,116
NA,It is a sobering fact indeed that only a tiny,116
NA,fraction of one per cent of all the water on,116
NA,earth is both suitable and available for hu-,116
NA,man consumption. Our expectations of water,116
NA,use have increased dramatically in recent,116
NA,generations. There are more of us than ever,116
NA,"before, and each of us uses more water than",116
NA,our predecessors would have dreamt of. This,116
NA,situation cannot continue and is only exacer-,116
NA,bated by changes in rainfall patterns and the,116
NA,dryland salinity now affecting much of the,116
NA,nation's land.,116
NA,It is now abundantly clear that we as a,116
NA,community must embark on an unprece-,116
NA,dented combined national effort addressing,116
NA,"how we manage, protect, use and share this",116
NA,most precious of the land's natural resources.,116
NA,"There will be no magic bullet, no easy solu-",116
NA,"tion, but efforts are starting, and many fresh",116
NA,and worthy new approaches are being pro-,116
NA,posed. It is well recognised that Australia is,116
NA,"the driest inhabited continent on earth, ensurmuch",116
NA,"ing that issues of water supply, management,",116
NA,use and reuse are a priority on the public,116
NA,policy agenda. It is therefore very pleasing to,116
NA,see that the Prime Minister of this country,116
NA,has identified water as a top personal priority,116
NA,for this term of government.,116
NA,There is no doubt that water and its provi-,116
NA,sion to our human population will be one of,116
NA,the greatest challenges facing not only Aus-,116
NA,tralia but the world in the 21st century. It has,116
NA,been reported that more than 2.6 billion peo-,116
NA,ple do not have adequate access to fresh wa-,116
NA,ter and sanitation and that thousands of peo-,116
NA,ple across the world die on a daily basis as a,116
NA,result of this deprivation and inadequacy.,116
NA,Human life is not possible without fresh wa-,116
NA,ter. We in Australia are somewhat more for-,116
NA,"tunate; although, following a series of",116
NA,droughts and an increasing urban population,116
NA,"and demand on our agricultural industries,",116
NA,we are facing a critical challenge to our wa-,116
NA,ter supply. It is very gratifying to see that the,116
NA,Australian government has already moved to,116
NA,"establish the National Water Commission,",116
NA,which will be charged with driving reform.,116
NA,We all must ensure that we stimulate our,116
NA,communities and industries to come up with,116
NA,innovations in addressing water use. The,116
NA,"Green Plumber program, developed by the",116
NA,"Master Plumbers Association, is one exam-",116
NA,ple of how industry and community can play,116
NA,a proactive role in this process. We need to,116
NA,look at new ideas and innovation-such as,116
NA,harvesting stormwater from our cities-and,116
NA,reconsider our approach to potable water and,116
NA,its distribution; the quality of water require-,116
NA,ments for industrial purposes; recycling and,116
NA,reusing grey water for domestic and indus-,116
NA,trial use; improvements to irrigation tech-,116
NA,niques and infrastructure; the active use of,116
NA,aquifers for water storage; and the construc-,116
NA,tion of new water transport facilities.,116
NA,"In Western Australia, these options excite",116
NA,community interest and support. There,116
NA,"are many ideas on the drawing board, such as",116
NA,in my home state the suggested pipeline from,117
NA,the Kimberleys to Perth and the planned de-,117
NA,"salination plant for Cockburn Sound, south",117
NA,of Perth. All of these options need to be,117
NA,evaluated-carefully and thoroughly. Rather,117
NA,"than being skewed by self-interest, all of",117
NA,these options need to be carefully and thor-,117
NA,"oughly evaluated, with one eye firmly fo-",117
NA,"cused on the needs of future generations,",117
NA,"families, business, industry and communi-",117
NA,ties.,117
NA,Like many with more expertise than I can,117
NA,"claim, I have serious concerns about the wis-",117
NA,dom of some of these projects. A desalina-,117
NA,"tion plant, for example, is extremely expen-",117
NA,"sive to build, has a high energy cost and",117
NA,therefore also has significant greenhouse gas,117
NA,consequences. It also raises the prospect of,117
NA,local environmental degradation through,117
NA,hypersalinity. A pipeline would appear to be,117
NA,"expensive, but would today's investment",117
NA,costs be seen that way in 50 or 100 years,117
NA,time? Where would we be today without,117
NA,C.Y. O'Connor's pipeline from Perth to Kal-,117
NA,"goorlie, this year celebrating 100 years? I am",117
NA,delighted to now be part of a federal gov-,117
NA,ernment team that has already been active on,117
NA,"this issue. However, I am disappointed that,",117
NA,given the challenges we face in Western Aus-,117
NA,"tralia with water supply and management,",117
NA,the WA government has chosen to go it,117
NA,alone.,117
NA,The issue of vocational training may seem,117
NA,"unrelated to that of water, but the underlying",117
NA,challenge is how our community chooses to,117
NA,respond. Apprenticeship training has an even,117
NA,longer history than academic institutions and,117
NA,continues to be an invaluable learning tradi-,117
NA,tion and employment pathway in our society.,117
NA,"In spite of this tradition, Australia",117
NA,serious national skills shortage. In my own,117
NA,"electorate of Hasluck, we particularly need",117
NA,"mechanics, welders, fitters and building",117
NA,trades men and women. Those of us who,117

NA,and apprenticeship training and the huge,117

NA,ment and indeed our nation were delighted to,117
NA,"hear the Prime Minister say, ‘I want to see an",117
NA,Australia where a trade apprenticeship is just,117
NA,as valued as a university degree.',117
NA,The record of the Howard government in,117
NA,the area of vocational and apprenticeship,117
NA,"training speaks for itself: 416,800 new ap-",117
NA,prentices and trainees in training at the end,117
NA,"of the March quarter 2004; 282,800 com-",117
NA,mencements in the 12 months ending March,117
NA,"2004, up from the previous year; 132,000",117
NA,completions in the 12 months to March,117
NA,"2004, up a massive 12 per cent from the pre-",117
NA,vious year. These statistics are a clear indica-,117
NA,tion that the policies of the Howard govern-,117
NA,ment are working.,117
NA,The election commitments made by the,117
NA,Prime Minister and the government will also,117
NA,make a significant contribution to further,117
NA,increasing the intake of new apprentices and,117
NA,trainees over the next three years. In particu-,117
NA,"lar, the establishment of 24 Australian tech-",117
NA,nical colleges will make a very positive con-,117
NA,tribution to attracting greater involvement by,117
NA,school leavers in trade training and a greater,117
NA,participation by industry in skilling Austra-,117
NA,lians. The need to create an effective alterna-,117
NA,tive to TAFE colleges in delivering industry,117
NA,specific skills has been demonstrated with,117
NA,the advent some years ago of industry spe-,117
NA,cific training centres. This is an area that I,117
NA,"have had some experience in, having been",117
NA,responsible for establishing and operating,117
NA,"MPA Skills in Western Australia, specialising",117
NA,in training for plumbing and painting appren-,117
NA,tices and skill enhancement programs for,117
NA,is facing a trades men and women.,117
NA,It is fair to say that one of the greatest,117
NA,challenges facing our vocational training,117
NA,system is that of the Commonwealth-state,117
NA,relationship and the bureaucracy associated,117
NA,"with it. At a time of national skills shortages,",118
NA,we simply cannot afford this. Programs such,118
NA,as User Choice which should be providing,118
NA,training options for apprentices and employ-,118
NA,"ers alike have been severely curtailed, adding",118
NA,to the confusion and bureaucratic maze em-,118
NA,ployers are expected to work their way,118
NA,through to make a considerable investment,118
NA,in training for the benefit of their business,118
NA,and also for the continued economic sustain-,118
NA,ability and benefit of Australia. The leader-,118
NA,ship role of the Prime Minister and his gov-,118
NA,ernment in introducing Australian technical,118
NA,colleges will go a long way to overcoming,118
NA,this unnecessary impasse in state and Com-,118
NA,monwealth funding arrangements for voca-,118
NA,tional training.,118
NA,"Mr Speaker, I do have a concern that not",118
NA,enough employers are investing in training,118
NA,apprentices. I believe that this is caused by a,118
NA,"lack of real incentive, poaching of appren-",118
NA,"tices, and the real cost of investing in train-",118
NA,ing for individual employers. Perhaps we,118
NA,"should consider that, for those employers",118
NA,"who invest in skilling Australia, such in-",118
NA,vestments be treated in the same way that we,118
NA,encourage companies to participate in re-,118
NA,search and development. If it is recognised,118
NA,that research and development is a driver of,118
NA,"economic growth, skilling Australians is es-",118
NA,sential for our continued economic growth. It,118
NA,therefore stands to reason that a tax incentive,118
NA,in the form of a tax concession has the poten-,118
NA,tial to be a more realistic and simple incen-,118
NA,tive to encourage employers to train appren-,118
NA,tices. Without a simple incentive for private,118
NA,"investment in education and training, it is",118
NA,probable that we will continue to face skill,118
NA,"shortages. Indeed, if we consider our ageing",118
NA,"work force across most industry sectors,",118
NA,there is an urgent need to attract greater in-,118
NA,vestment in training.,118
NA,As well as attracting new entrants to the,118
NA,"trades from the school sector, we need to",118
NA,consider reskilling those already in the work,118
NA,force who are underemployed or facing re-,118
NA,dundancy from their current employment. As,118
NA,"our work force ages, this strategy will only",118
NA,become more important and more urgent. As,118
NA,with all things that should be seen as invest-,118
NA,"ments, the sooner we begin, the easier and",118
NA,more effective our efforts will be. While an,118
NA,individual must accept some responsibility,118
NA,for ongoing skill development during their,118
NA,"working life, it is not an issue for them alone.",118
NA,The increasing rate of change in technical,118
NA,skills and knowledge and the continuous,118
NA,change in the business environment and,118
NA,workplace suggests the need for ongoing,118
NA,vocational training. Those businesses that,118
NA,adapt more readily to this could achieve a,118
NA,significant competitive advantage. The proc-,118
NA,ess of continuous learning and our attitude to,118
NA,lifelong learning needs to move beyond,118
NA,rhetoric to the point that it is built into our,118
NA,"workplaces, schools and communities.",118
NA,"In addition, much more needs to be done",118
NA,"to ensure the industry relevance, knowledge",118
NA,and skills of trainers and lecturers who play,118
NA,such an important role in influencing the,118
NA,next generation and subsequent generations,118
NA,of Australia's work force. This will require a,118
NA,structured process aimed at ensuring both a,118
NA,consistent industry interface during the,118
NA,course of a trainer's working life and con-,118
NA,tinuous industry specific skills development.,118
NA,In talking about vocational training we,118
NA,should also acknowledge the significant con-,118
NA,tribution that group training companies have,118
NA,made to the contemporary evolution and de-,118
NA,velopment of apprenticeship training and,118
NA,traineeships in this country.,118
NA,The final challenge I wish to raise here to-,118
NA,day is the question of how we can better,118
NA,support small business. This is the sector that,118
NA,most truly underpins our economic capacity,118
NA,"and, indeed, our Australian way of life. The",118
NA,small business sector is full of some of Aus-,118
NA,"tralia's most self-reliant, innovative and en-",118
NA,trepreneurial people. They create employ-,118
NA,ment and build both individual and economic,119
NA,capacity from the smallest of our country,119
NA,towns to the biggest of our cities.,119
NA,Recent figures indicate that Australia now,119
NA,boasts a significant increase in the self-,119
NA,"employed. This is a telling statistic, reflect-",119
NA,ing what individuals are actually looking for,119
NA,in their working lives. It has been predicted,119
NA,that over the next 30 years or so the majority,119
NA,"of the work force will be self-employed, yet",119
NA,we still allow excessive regulation and com-,119
NA,pliance requirements to stand in the way of,119
NA,these people and their aspirations. We oblige,119
NA,people to operate within a regulated labour,119
NA,market with restrictive award conditions that,119
NA,"are in nobody's long-term interests, and we",119
NA,leave them vulnerable to unfettered access,119
NA,and disruption by representatives of unions.,119
NA,In focusing on the tiny number of em-,119
NA,"ployers that may not do the right thing, we",119
NA,are systematically and consistently penalis-,119
NA,ing tens of thousands of employers who do.,119
NA,Add to this the fact that the complexity and,119
NA,"level of our taxation, including the cumula-",119
NA,tive effect of many individual taxes on busi-,119
NA,"nesses, act as a powerful disincentive to",119
NA,business growth and to employment. Count-,119
NA,less people are missing out on jobs that are,119
NA,simply not being created.,119
NA,"What we do about water, training and",119
NA,small business are just three of the important,119
NA,questions facing us as a nation. Each of these,119
NA,is close to my heart and important to my,119
NA,electorate. Each is something I hope to be,119
NA,able to make a positive contribution towards,119
NA,while I represent all the people of the elec-,119
NA,"torate of Hasluck, without fear or favour. It",119
NA,"because of them that I stand here today, inde-",119
NA,scribably proud to be the federal member for,119
NA,"the seat of Hasluck during this, the 41st Aus-",119
NA,tralian Parliament. I thank the House for its,119
NA,indulgence.,119
The SPEAKER,Order! Before I call the,119
NA,"honourable member for Braddon, I would",119
NA,like to acknowledge the presence of the,119
NA,President of the Senate. Before the member,119
NA,"for Braddon commences, I remind the House",119
NA,that this is his first speech and I ask the,119
NA,House to extend the usual courtesies.,119
Mr BAKER ,Braddon) (6.51 p.m.)- Mr,119
NA,"Speaker may I, at the outset, congratulate",119
NA,you on your election and Mr Deputy Speaker,119
NA,and Mr Second Deputy Speaker on their re-,119
NA,election. It is with a deep sense of pride that I,119
NA,rise in this chamber to address the House. I,119
NA,"know I share that feeling with everyone here,",119
NA,especially the recently elected new members,119
NA,on both sides. We have a sense of great privi-,119
NA,lege at being elected to represent our con-,119
NA,stituents.,119
NA,During the great constitutional debates of,119
NA,"the 1890s, our founding fathers discussed",119
NA,what to call the main elected chamber of the,119
NA,prospective federal government. A number of,119
NA,"names were considered, but the greatest sup-",119
NA,port went to adopting the name ‘House of,119
NA,Representatives'. This was a deliberate step.,119
NA,The new Australian parliament could have,119
NA,"chosen a neutral term, such as ‘house of as-",119
NA,sembly' or adopted the style of many Euro-,119
NA,pean parliaments and used ‘house of dele-,119
NA,gates'. Yet the founders had no doubt that the,119
NA,main responsibilities of the members of the,119
NA,new federal house of government were to,119
NA,"represent their constituents; their needs, their",119
NA,concerns and their aspirations.,119
NA,One of those founding fathers was the,119
NA,Tasmanian statesman Sir Edward Braddon.,119
NA,He was a distinguished colonial premier of,119
NA,Tasmania and represented Tasmania at sev-,119
NA,is eral federal conventions. In 1903 Sir Edward,119
NA,"Braddon-who, coincidentally, was at the",119
NA,time a neighbouring farmer of my paternal,119
NA,great-grandfather-was elected the first,119
NA,"member for Wilmot, but he died a year later,",119
NA,in 1904. Some public minded local landown-,119
NA,ers subsequently set aside some land on a,119
NA,"vantage point near Forth, a small town be-",119
NA,tween Devonport and Burnie. This land is,120
NA,called Braddon's Lookout and commands a,120
NA,magnificent view of much of the north-west,120
NA,coast and Bass Strait. The lookout is above,120
NA,"Lillico Beach, named after my maternal fore-",120
NA,"bears, who first settled this land in 1865. It",120
NA,important to remind ourselves of this be-,120
NA,cause we do not often remember those peo-,120
NA,ple who got together to write our Constitu-,120
NA,"tion, and it is right that we honour them.",120
NA,From 1903 the north-west federal seat was,120
NA,known as Darwin because Charles Darwin's,120
NA,famous ship the Beagle dropped anchor on,120
NA,the north-west coast to replenish supplies of,120
NA,fresh water during its voyage to the Southern,120
NA,Ocean. The first member for Darwin was the,120
NA,flamboyant King O'Malley. O'Malley was,120
NA,the minister for home affairs at the time,120
NA,when Canberra was chosen as the future site,120
NA,of the federal capital in 1913 and was in fact,120
NA,the longest living member of the first federal,120
NA,parliament when he died in 1953. Another,120
NA,"prominent member was Sir George Bell, who",120
NA,became Speaker of the House of Representa-,120
NA,tives and a significant parliamentarian. A,120
NA,"beautiful part of my electorate, Bell's Parade,",120
NA,near Latrobe-where I spent many happy,120
NA,hours as a child-is named in his memory.,120
NA,But perhaps the most famous of my,120
NA,predecessors in this seat is the Hon. Dame,120
NA,"Enid Muriel Lyons, widow of the distin-",120
NA,guished Tasmanian who became Prime Min-,120
NA,"ister, Joe Lyons. Dame Enid was member for",120
NA,"Darwin from 1943 to 1951, when she was",120
NA,forced to retire because of ill health. Dame,120
NA,Enid is well known as the first woman to,120
NA,"become a member of this House, represent-",120
NA,"ing first the United Australia Party and, when",120
NA,"it was founded, the Liberal Party. She was",120
NA,also the first woman to become minister of,120
NA,"the Crown, serving in the Menzies govern-",120
NA,ment from 1949 to 1951 as Vice-President of,120
NA,the Executive Council. Her late husband had,120
NA,"held that same portfolio, and I think this",120
NA,would be the only occasion when a husband,120
NA,and wife have shared such an achievement.,120
NA,Although her health forced Dame Enid to,120
NA,"leave the parliament in 1951, she continued a",120
NA,significant role in public life over the next 30,120
NA,"years, serving as a commissioner of the ABC",120
NA,is and fulfilling many public engagements. As a,120
NA,"child growing up in Devonport, I have fond",120
NA,memories of watching Dame Enid piloting,120
NA,"her grey Humber car through the streets, and",120
NA,of dodging it at times. She was known and,120
NA,loved by many.,120
NA,"In 1955, when Aubrey Luck was the Lib-",120
NA,"eral member, the parliament passed a resolu-",120
NA,tion changing the name of the seat from,120
NA,Darwin to Braddon. Aubrey held many pub-,120
NA,lic offices during and after his parliamentary,120
NA,"term, including a very important position as",120
NA,a very popular patron of the Devonport,120
NA,Football Club. I played for the club for a,120
NA,number of seasons and was fortunate to be,120
NA,"captain, play in two premierships and repre-",120
NA,sent Tasmania. I remember Mr Luck as a,120
NA,supportive presence and a friend of my par-,120
NA,ents.,120
NA,Two of my other distinguished Liberal,120
NA,"predecessors were Ray Groom, a former",120
NA,prominent footballer who held the seat of,120
NA,"Braddon from 1975 to 1984, served as a min-",120
NA,ister in the Fraser government and later held,120
NA,office as Premier of Tasmania; and Chris,120
NA,"Miles, who was the Braddon MP from 1984",120
NA,to 1998 and was Parliamentary Secretary to,120
NA,"Cabinet in the first Howard government. So,",120
NA,"as the new member for Braddon, I am very",120
NA,conscious of the legacy of previous federal,120
NA,Liberal parliamentarians who have so ably,120
NA,represented the electorate.,120
NA,"I believe I am fortunate, although some",120
NA,members of my family would say that is de-,120
NA,"batable, to have some political blood running",120
NA,through my veins. My great-uncle Elliott,120
NA,Lillico was member for Meander in the Tas-,120
NA,manian Legislative Council and then a Lib-,120
NA,eral senator for Tasmania for 15 years before,120
NA,retiring in 1974. My maternal great-,121
NA,"grandfather was Sir Alexander Lillico, a",121
NA,member of the Tasmanian Legislative Coun-,121
NA,cil for some 30 years-a record which still,121
NA,stands today. Sir Alexander entered parlia-,121
NA,"ment as an unassuming farmer who, it is re-",121
NA,"corded, ‘had neither the benefit of oratory",121
NA,nor of high education'. His main quality was,121
NA,"integrity, and I believe that is a special",121
NA,that is missing in many sectors today.,121
NA,In 1944 the Labor government wanted the,121
NA,states to transfer certain powers to the Com-,121
NA,monwealth. This was supported by each state,121
NA,parliament except the Tasmanian Legislative,121
NA,Council. The Tasmanian upper house was,121
NA,"split 10-8, with Sir Alexander Lillico leading",121
NA,the opposition. Dr Evatt was despatched by,121
NA,Prime Minister Curtin to Tasmania to secure,121
NA,support for that bill. This became known as,121
NA,the Evatt versus Lillico affair. Evatt failed,121
NA,persuade the Tasmanians to change their op-,121
NA,"position. Frustrated, he put the powers bill to",121
NA,a referendum. It was rejected by every state,121
NA,"except South Australia, where it passed by",121
NA,only a slim margin. This is a lesson well,121
NA,worth recording. The instinct of a small mi-,121
NA,nority to oppose something thought desirable,121
NA,by almost every other parliamentarian in,121
NA,Australia was proven to be in fact consistent,121
NA,with the overwhelming view of the elector-,121
NA,"ate. It is a very important reminder, I believe,",121
NA,that we must always keep in touch with our,121
NA,"electors. They are, after all, our employers. I",121
NA,swore the oath of allegiance as the member,121
NA,for Braddon somewhat daunted by the list of,121
NA,predecessors who have held this seat.,121
NA,I was born in Devonport and raised along,121
NA,with my three elder sisters on the family,121
NA,farm nearby. When attending school in De-,121
NA,vonport I was a restless young man who pre-,121
NA,ferred learning by doing rather than in the,121
NA,"classroom. Consequently, I left after grade",121
NA,"10 to train as a carpenter and joiner, and ob-",121
NA,tained a trade certificate at the Devonport,121
NA,"Technical College. After a period, and with",121
NA,"counsel from my previous teachers, I decided",121
NA,to further my studies at the Tasmanian State,121
NA,Institute of Technology and later at the Uni-,121
NA,versity of Tasmania. I completed a Bachelor,121
NA,of Education and subsequently was em-,121
NA,ployed as a secondary teacher in Tasmanian,121
NA,high schools.,121
NA,I then made a career choice to pursue fur-,121
NA,asset ther studies in commerce and law and move,121
NA,back to the business world in the area of,121
NA,business and financial management. This,121
NA,provided me with opportunities to travel,121
NA,"overseas, including to the USA and Canada,",121
NA,and the chance to observe other national fi-,121
NA,nancial systems in action. This experience,121
NA,"was invaluable, and I met many who were",121
NA,envious of the probity and efficiency of the,121
NA,Australian financial system.,121
NA,"In November 1998, whilst working in",121
NA,"to Launceston in northern Tasmania, something",121
NA,happened which dramatically changed the,121
NA,course of my life. While crossing a one-way,121
NA,"street, I looked the wrong way in a moment",121
NA,of distraction. The result was a traumatic,121
NA,injury and many months in acute care in,121
NA,"hospital, followed by well over three years of",121
NA,intensive physical rehabilitation. This placed,121
NA,"great stresses on my personal life, and I want",121
NA,to pay tribute to my family-especially to,121
NA,"my mother, Margaret Joy, and to my three",121
NA,"sisters, Helen, Diane and Peta, who were",121
NA,enormously supportive during this period. I,121
NA,"wish to acknowledge two of my sisters,",121
NA,"Helen and Diane, who are here in the gallery",121
NA,today. My mother always gave our family,121
NA,unreserved support. She was our guiding,121
NA,light-a beautiful person who had a special,121
NA,and unique relationship with each family,121
NA,"member. We were devastated when, after a",121
NA,"short illness, she died in the middle of this",121
NA,election campaign. I know she would have,121
NA,been proud to see one of her children stand-,121
NA,ing in this House.,121
NA,They say that every cloud has a silver lin-,122
NA,ing. On many occasions I could not see any-,122
NA,thing positive about what happened to me.,122
NA,"Yet, that saying is true. I met some wonder-",122
NA,ful medical and nursing staff at the,122
NA,"Launceston General Hospital, and I made",122
NA,some truly inspirational friends amongst my,122
NA,"fellow patients. Once I was back on my feet,",122
NA,I resolved to give something back to society.,122
NA,I became involved in the Road Trauma Sup-,122
NA,port Team in northern Tasmania and the Clif-,122
NA,"ford Craig Medical Research Trust, and I",122
NA,became a member of the Tasmanian Road,122
NA,Safety Consultative Committee. It is not,122
NA,widely known that for every road death in,122
NA,"Tasmania, 30 people are seriously injured in",122
NA,motor vehicle accidents; and it is even worse,122
NA,in some mainland states. These injuries in-,122
NA,"clude paraplegia, loss of limbs and serious",122
NA,"brain damage. A former Tasmanian Premier,",122
NA,"the Hon. Tony Rundle, rightly called this ‘the",122
NA,hidden disease'. I am strongly of the view,122
NA,that there should be compulsory driver edu-,122
NA,"cation in every Australian school, from grade",122
NA,9 to grade 12. If a school today decided not,122
NA,"to offer computer science, maths or English,",122
NA,parents and the community would be rightly,122
NA,astonished. Yet a number of schools either,122
NA,ignore driver education or have ceased to,122
NA,offer it. Irreparable damage can be done by a,122
NA,"young, inexperienced driver in charge of a",122
NA,"motor car, and governments at all levels have",122
NA,an obligation to prepare young Australians,122
NA,for the nation's roads.,122
NA,One legacy which the experience of being,122
NA,in that road accident has instilled in me is,122
NA,highest regard for our public hospital system,122
NA,and for the quality of the people who make it,122
NA,work. That is something I shall never forget.,122
NA,One of the tasks I took on was to become,122
NA,chairman of the Save Launceston General,122
NA,Hospital Committee. In this role I acted as an,122
NA,intermediary for the hospital's medical and,122
NA,other staff and the state bureaucracy. I was,122
NA,astounded to find-having come from a pri-,122
NA,vate industry background-that no fewer,122
NA,than 32 approvals were needed for an expen-,122
NA,"diture of $20,000 or more by the hospital. I",122
NA,"am not sure that the system has improved,",122
NA,and it is very important that state govern-,122
NA,ments around Australia tackle the burden of,122
NA,red tape and bureaucracy that is eating up so,122
NA,much of the health dollar.,122
NA,The electorate that I am privileged to rep-,122
NA,resent is in a beautiful part of the state. I was,122
NA,"marvelling last week, yet again, at how rich",122
NA,the agricultural land is in that part of Tasma-,122
NA,nia. And it will not be surprising for mem-,122
NA,bers to learn that 10 per cent of the popula-,122
NA,tion of Braddon are directly employed in,122
NA,agriculture. There is a wide variety of farm-,122
NA,"ing, including cropping and sheep farming,",122
NA,and it is the state's centre for dairy produc-,122
NA,tion. We are also privileged to have other,122
NA,niche markets. We have kelp harvesting and,122
NA,"poppy production, we are a world leader in",122
NA,"pyrethrum production, and we have a signifi-",122
NA,cant tulip estate at Table Cape-which has,122
NA,grown to be so successful that it has become,122
NA,a popular tourist attraction and actually ex-,122
NA,ports products to the Netherlands during the,122
NA,northern winter. We also have a fledgling,122
NA,"wine-growing industry in Braddon, which",122
NA,should not be too surprising given that our,122
NA,latitude is the same in the south as Tuscany,122
NA,in the north.,122
NA,"Out of the city of Devonport, the ‘gateway",122
NA,"to Tasmania', operate the three Spirit of",122
NA,Tasmania ferries-two to Melbourne and one,122
NA,to Sydney. It is important to remind the,122
NA,the House that a large measure of the commer-,122
NA,"cial success of these vessels, which have",122
NA,heralded a significant tourism boom in Tas-,122
NA,"mania and have contributed to lower airfares,",122
NA,came directly from the Howard govern-,122
NA,ment's decision in 1996 to establish the Bass,122
NA,Strait Passenger Vehicle Equalisation,122
NA,Scheme.,122
NA,Apart from the 10 per cent who are in-,123
NA,"volved in agriculture, 15 per cent of the",123
NA,adults in the Braddon electorate are em-,123
NA,ployed in some form of manufacturing in-,123
NA,"dustry, and a further 25 per cent are em-",123
NA,ployed in construction or trade orientated,123
NA,industries.,123
NA,I have deliberately set out these statistics,123
NA,to give the House an indication of the profile,123
NA,"of the seat of Braddon, which swung to the",123
NA,Liberal Party by a margin of almost 7½ per,123
NA,cent on 9 October this year. That was the,123
NA,strongest swing to the Liberal Party nation-,123
NA,wide to gain a seat-an outstanding result for,123
NA,the Liberal Party. That outcome is directly,123
NA,attributable to two things: the hard work of,123
NA,the Liberal Party grassroots members in all,123
NA,of the branches on the north-west coast and,123
NA,the consistent leadership of this country by,123
NA,our Prime Minister. I wish to acknowledge,123
NA,and thank the Tasmanian Liberal Senate,123
NA,"team: Senators Calvert, Abetz, Colbeck,",123
NA,Watson and Barnett. Richard Colbeck led the,123
NA,north-west coast ably. I thank you. I also,123
NA,thank the ministers who journeyed down to,123
NA,"our great electorate, and I make a special",123
NA,NA,123
NA,"director, and his family, who gave me tre-",123
NA,mendous support through the election.,123
NA,As someone working in financial man-,123
NA,"agement, I was in no doubt that the hard",123
NA,work undertaken by the Prime Minister and,123
NA,the Treasurer over the last eight years-to,123
NA,first stabilise and then grow our national,123
NA,economy to be a world leader-is the most,123
NA,important achievement. Without a strong,123
NA,"economy, no government can do good things",123
NA,for Australia and Australians. More than 70,123
NA,per cent of people in my electorate own or,123
NA,"are currently buying their homes, so they",123
NA,have a clear understanding of the vital im-,123
NA,portance of managing our $800 billion econ-,123
NA,"omy, of maintaining a budget surplus and of",123
NA,the proper management of interest rates.,123
NA,I was particularly pleased to see in the,123
NA,Governor-General's speech that His Excel-,123
NA,"lency mentioned the Future Fund, to take",123
NA,account of the ageing of the Australian popu-,123
NA,lation. Braddon has one of the older demo-,123
NA,"graphics in the country, with 14 per cent of",123
NA,"the electorate being aged over 65 years, so I",123
NA,will take a particular interest in the manage-,123
NA,ment of the health and welfare sector. One of,123
NA,the most important elements of aged care is,123
NA,allowing people to remain independent as,123
NA,"long as they are able, preferably in their own",123
NA,homes. People having to move because of,123
NA,frailty not only dislocates them but can also,123
NA,"separate them from family, friends and the",123
NA,network with which they are familiar. I am a,123
NA,strong believer in improved domiciliary care,123
NA,and the development of graded aged care,123
NA,"facilities, where a resident can move from an",123
NA,"independent-living unit, to hostel type ac-",123
NA,"commodation, to a nursing home-",123
NA,depending upon their personal circumstances,123
NA,and own needs. There are a number of excel-,123
NA,"lent facilities in Braddon, but the ageing pro-",123
NA,file of our nation means that the private sec-,123
NA,tor will have to work more with the federal,123
NA,and state governments to fulfil this need.,123
NA,I have been very supportive of the How-,123
NA,ard government's support for apprenticeships,123
NA,and for the technical education system na-,123
NA,tionally. Since 1996 the number of appren-,123
NA,tices in Braddon has increased threefold and,123
NA,the government has successfully moved to,123
NA,dispel the myth that vocational education is,123
NA,somehow ‘second best' to tertiary study. As,123
NA,someone with a rural upbringing who began,123
NA,his working career with a four-year appren-,123
NA,"ticeship, then decided to go on to university",123
NA,study and is in the process of completing his,123
NA,"third university degree, I believe that I am",123
NA,equipped to remind the House that each ca-,123
NA,reer path is as valuable as the other. I com-,123
NA,mend the Prime Minister for his announce-,123
NA,ment during the election campaign that 24,123
NA,new federal technical colleges would be es-,123
NA,tablished across Australia if the government,124
NA,were returned.,124
NA,The mining industry is also a strong con-,124
NA,tributor to the economy in my electorate. A,124
NA,variety of mining operations flourish in,124
NA,"Braddon, such as the Savage River mine.",124
NA,Magnetite ore is mined at Savage River and,124
NA,then pumped along an 85-kilometre pipeline,124
NA,"to Port Latta, where it is pelletised. Produc-",124
NA,tion in 2002-03 totalled some 5.3 million,124
NA,tonnes and provided employment for 420,124
NA,"people. At Railton, south of Devonport, the",124
NA,Cement Australia plant operates using local,124
NA,limestone. In 2002-03 more than 1.26 mil-,124
NA,"lion tonnes were produced, the vast majority",124
NA,shipped here to mainland Australia. The ce-,124
NA,ment operation at Railton provides employ-,124
NA,ment for over 170 people. There is a range of,124
NA,other mining operations including mineral,124
NA,sands operations at Naracoopa on King Is-,124
NA,land and magnesite mining at Arthur River,124
NA,and Main Creek. One of the as yet largely,124
NA,untapped resources is the dolomite resource,124
NA,at Circular Head. I am advised that the re-,124
NA,serve of dolomite in that area of Tasmania is,124
NA,the largest concentration in the Southern,124
NA,"Hemisphere, and there are a number of excit-",124
NA,ing possibilities there for future exploration.,124
NA,Braddon also boasts Australian Paper's,124
NA,"Wesley Vale and Burnie mills, where com-",124
NA,bined annual production is more than a quar-,124
NA,ter of a million tonnes. Together they employ,124
NA,over 500 people and have ongoing relation-,124
NA,ships with some 140 local contractors. Brad-,124
NA,don also boasts major ports at Burnie and,124
NA,Devonport and a significant port at Stanley.,124
NA,These services not only export manufactured,124
NA,and raw materials but also support a flourish-,124
NA,ing local fishing industry. Braddon is also,124
NA,where some of the finest cheeses in the,124
NA,world are produced and-this may surprise,124
NA,honourable members-is the location of a,124
NA,"growing market in quality chocolates, a",124
NA,benefit of our rich dairy assets. My electorate,124
NA,is also one of the biggest exporters of onions,124
NA,overseas and provides all of the potato needs,124
NA,to two well-known national takeaway restau-,124
NA,rant chains.,124
NA,Braddon also is a world leader in forestry,124
NA,and associated timber industries. It possesses,124
NA,"timbers such as the magnificent Huon pine,",124
NA,"blackwood, myrtle, celery-top pine and Tas-",124
NA,manian eucalypt. After the implementation,124
NA,"of the Howard government's election policy,",124
NA,over one million hectares of forests in Tas-,124
NA,mania will be protected forever. This,124
NA,amounts to some 42 per cent of Tasmania's,124
NA,landmass. This is a unique outcome un-,124
NA,equalled in the world today. It is my respon-,124
NA,sibility to dispel the myth that there are few,124
NA,"trees left in Tasmania. In fact, the opposite is",124
NA,true.,124
NA,"Braddon, therefore, is a diverse electorate.",124
NA,"It has two significant cities, a number of",124
NA,other substantial towns and no particular,124
NA,central point. This makes it a particular chal-,124
NA,"lenge for any federal representative, but I",124
NA,pledge now to represent every part of the,124
NA,electorate from King Island to the far north-,124
NA,"west coast, to Savage River and Waratah,",124
NA,"Smithton, Burnie, Ulverstone and Devon-",124
NA,"port. Tasmania is a small state and, perhaps",124
NA,"uniquely in Australia, most people know at",124
NA,least one state and/or federal parliamentar-,124
NA,ian. I fully understand that with that friendly,124
NA,familiarity comes a burden of trust and re-,124
NA,sponsibility that I will strive to fulfil.,124
NA,In common with many Australians and,124
NA,"other honourable members, my family has",124
NA,served our nation in time of war. My grand-,124
NA,father Arthur Horden Baker fought in France,124
NA,with the Australian Army in World War I and,124
NA,"paid the supreme sacrifice. My late father,",124
NA,"Petre Baker, served as a Squadron Leader in",124
NA,the Royal Australian Air Force during World,124
NA,"War II, attached to Bomber Command, and",124
NA,participated in a remarkable 60 flights over,124
NA,occupied Europe. He returned to farm on the,124
NA,north-west coast and rarely talked about this,124
NA,brave service. He was a man of immense,125
NA,character whom I was privileged to have as a,125
NA,father. My brother-in-law Rodney Layton,125
NA,served in Vietnam and my nephew Na-,125
NA,than Layton has continued the family tradi-,125
NA,"tion, serving in the Royal Australian Air",125
NA,Force in Iraq in this year. Honourable mem-,125
NA,bers can perhaps imagine how proud I am of,125
NA,"that. With this family background, I feel it",125
NA,so important that our nation has been led,125
NA,during these difficult times by a strong and,125
NA,resolute leader. We certainly have such a,125
NA,man in our Prime Minister.,125
NA,I look forward to contributing to the work,125
NA,of the fourth Howard government. I look,125
NA,forward to being a representative of all the,125
NA,people of Braddon-to listening to their con-,125
NA,cerns and representing them in the counsels,125
NA,of government. When my great-grandfather,125
NA,"died in 1966 at the age of 94, the Advocate",125
NA,newspaper said that ‘his main asset was his,125
NA,sincerity and he was guided by what he,125
NA,thought would be best for the state'. I do not,125
NA,know if a higher tribute is possible for any,125
NA,parliamentarian. With the support of my col-,125
NA,leagues I intend to dedicate myself to work-,125
NA,ing hard and consistently for the people of,125
NA,Braddon and the Parliament of Australia. I,125
NA,thank the House.,125
Mr DANBY ,Melbourne Ports) (7.13,125
NA,p.m.)-I will begin rather slowly to allow the,125
NA,"member for Braddon, who has just made his",125
NA,"first speech, to be congratulated. I take this",125
NA,"opportunity of congratulating you, Mr",125
NA,"Speaker, on your election to the position of",125
NA,Speaker. I welcome your commitment to,125
NA,fairness in your treatment of those on all,125
NA,sides of the House. I also congratulate the,125
NA,honourable members for Page and Scullin on,125
NA,their re-elections as Deputy Speaker and,125
NA,Second Deputy Speaker respectively. I be-,125
NA,lieve that the House will be well served by,125
NA,all three senior occupants of the chair. I,125
NA,congratulate all the new members who have,125
NA,just made their first speeches.,125
NA,It is a great honour for me to have been re-,125
NA,turned for a third term as the member for,125
NA,"Melbourne Ports, maintaining a Labor tradi-",125
NA,tion which dates back to 1906. The seat has,125
NA,changed beyond recognition since the days,125
NA,"of Ted Holloway and Frank Crean, when it",125
NA,was a safe Labor seat. We retained the seat,125
NA,with a negative swing below the national,125
NA,is average and well below the Victorian aver-,125
NA,age and for that I thank my constituents in,125
NA,Melbourne Ports very much for their support.,125
NA,I would like to thank all those who,125
NA,"worked on my campaign team, particularly",125
NA,"my campaign director, Steve Donnelly. I fear",125
NA,Labor's victory in Adelaide means that Steve,125
NA,"will be transferring his loyalties elsewhere,",125
NA,but I do appreciate the hard work he put into,125
NA,the campaign. I would also like to thank my,125
NA,"staff, Alex Kats, Tony Williams and Dr",125
NA,"Adam Carr, and my campaign committee",125
NA,"including Dr Henry Pinskier, Bunna Walsh,",125
NA,"Tonya Stephens, Alex Hicks, Sylvia Free-",125
NA,"man, Donna Walsh, Dror Poleg, Byron",125
NA,"Danby, George Droutsas, Natalie Lupton,",125
NA,and all the loyal Labor members and volun-,125
NA,teers across the electorate who did so much,125
NA,work to ensure our rather unusual result in,125
NA,Melbourne Ports. I would also like to thank,125
NA,my state parliamentary colleagues Tony Lup-,125
NA,ton and John Thwaites and my friends at the,125
NA,"AWU, MUA, SDA and HSU who gave me",125
NA,their assistance.,125
NA,The Liberal Party thought they had a seri-,125
NA,ous chance of winning Melbourne Ports at,125
NA,"this election, and they chose a candidate",125
NA,whom they thought might appeal to some of,125
NA,my core supporters. The Victorian Liberal,125
NA,"Party, the candidate and his family spent an",125
NA,estimated quarter of a million dollars trying,125
NA,to unseat me. They also resorted to some of,125
NA,the most unpleasant campaign tactics we,125
NA,have seen in Melbourne Ports in any of the,125
NA,"also elections I have participated in, including",125
NA,unauthorised and anonymous leaflets attack-,125
NA,"ing my record, particularly on issues relating",125
NA,"to the gay community, and letterboxed to the",126
NA,homes of Orthodox Jewish families. Another,126
NA,tactic was the use of green how-to-vote,126
NA,"cards, handed out by young women in green",126
NA,t-shirts and hats. This was a cheap trick de-,126
NA,signed to fool first-time voters into voting,126
NA,Liberal in the belief that they were voting,126
NA,"the Greens. Despite all these tactics, the",126
NA,ernment's candidate was not successful.,126
NA,"Nevertheless, we on this side of the House",126
NA,have to acknowledge that we lost the election,126
NA,and that the Howard Government has a man-,126
NA,date to govern for the next three years. From,126
NA,next July they will also have control of the,126
NA,Senate and thus will have the ability to legischampion,126
NA,late as they see fit. As we are already seeing,126
NA,"with the abortion issue, I fear this means that",126
NA,the government will feel increasing pressure,126
NA,to move further to the right on a range of,126
NA,issues that up till now they have moved cau-,126
NA,"tiously on. The government has a mandate,",126
NA,but history has shown that if they abuse it by,126
NA,putting through extremist measures they will,126
NA,pay a heavy price.,126
NA,Why did Labor lose this election? The ba-,126
NA,sic answer is that Australia has experienced,126
NA,"more than a decade of economic growth, low",126
NA,"inflation, low interest rates and falling un-",126
NA,"employment, and Australian voters are usu-",126
NA,ally reluctant to vote out a government when,126
NA,they are broadly happy with the state of the,126
NA,economy. The foundations of this economic,126
NA,success were laid by the Hawke and Keating,126
NA,"governments, and I think we on this side of",126
NA,the House have not done enough to remind,126
NA,people of that fact. The Prime Minister and,126
NA,the Treasurer have had the good fortune of,126
NA,reaping the benefits of many of the economic,126
NA,reforms that Labor enacted. The Treasurer,126
NA,"likes to boast of his record, but so far he",126
NA,not been tested by external factors. We will,126
NA,see what kind of navigator he really is when,126
NA,the ship of state really hits stormy economic,126
NA,waters.,126
NA,The second factor was the government's,126
NA,"campaign on interest rates, which undoubt-",126
NA,edly influenced many voters in mortgage belt,126
NA,"suburban seats. This campaign was bogus, as",126
NA,virtually every senior economist in Australia,126
NA,"pointed out. If interest rates are going to rise,",126
NA,"for and I fear they may, they are going to rise",126
NA,govregardless of who is in government. In case,126
NA,"members opposite have forgotten, this is how",126
NA,free market economies are supposed to work.,126
NA,In their advertising the government cam-,126
NA,paigned as though we were living in East,126
NA,"Germany, with prices and interest rates fixed",126
NA,by the state. You cannot on one hand be a,126
NA,of deregulation and market forces,126
NA,and on the other claim that you are able to,126
NA,dictate whether interest rates will go up or,126
NA,down. I thought that was the preserve of the,126
NA,"Reserve Bank. The fact remains, however,",126
NA,that Labor was unable to counter the gov-,126
NA,"ernment's scare campaign, which we should",126
NA,have seen coming and will have to be,126
NA,sharper in countering in the future. It is vital,126
NA,that Labor emphasises its strong economic,126
NA,"credentials, and I am confident that the",126
NA,shadow Treasurer will put forward an effec-,126
NA,tive analysis and criticism of the govern-,126
NA,ment's economic policies and develop poli-,126
NA,cies for the next election which will win the,126
NA,support of the Australian people.,126
NA,"The third factor of our defeat, in my view,",126
NA,was the late release of our key policies on,126
NA,"health, education and the environment, all",126
NA,areas in which the Australian people tradi-,126
NA,tionally look to Labor rather than the coali-,126
NA,tion for answers. I believe our policies in all,126
NA,three areas were imaginative and well inten-,126
NA,"tioned, and some were received well by the",126
NA,Australian people. But their late release,126
NA,has meant that we could not mount an effective,126
NA,campaign around them and we could not,126
NA,make a defence against the criticisms that,126
NA,were made in the media by the government,126
NA,and by affected lobby groups. In the area of,126
NA,"forest policy, as a prospective beneficiary of",126
NA,this policy as an inner city member-the,127
NA,Greens polled 14 per cent of the vote in Mel-,127
NA,bourne Ports and gave me 90 per cent of,127
NA,their preferences-I believe our policy of,127
NA,ending logging in Tasmania's old-growth,127
NA,forests was a price we paid for those prefer-,127
NA,ences with too high a coin. We would have,127
NA,"got their preferences anyhow, and the defeat",127
NA,of two fine Labor members in Tasmania-,127
NA,including the previous member for Braddon;,127
NA,we have just heard the new member make,127
NA,his first speech-the loss of a Senate place in,127
NA,Tasmania and probably our failures in Eden-,127
NA,"Monaro, MCMillan and Gippsland was a",127
NA,"price that was, in my view, too high. The",127
NA,issue of chasing Greens preferences at the,127
NA,expense of working-class voters is an issue,127
NA,which the Labor Party have to face very,127
NA,"squarely and, in my view, was an error of",127
NA,"judgement. Once again, the possibility of",127
NA,recouping the damage was lost because the,127
NA,policy was released late.,127
NA,Let me turn to some of the issues that I be-,127
NA,lieve will confront us during this parliamen-,127
NA,"tary term. Recently, on the front page of the",127
NA,"Australian, we saw a story on the report by",127
NA,the Australian Competition and Consumer,127
NA,"Commission into Australia's waterfront,",127
NA,"which shows rising costs for exporters, in-",127
NA,creasing congestion and delays at ports. The,127
NA,report shows that the rate of return for the,127
NA,two existing stevedoring companies-Patrick,127
NA,and P&O Ports-has risen from 10.5 per,127
NA,cent in 1998-99 to over 27 per cent in 2003-,127
NA,"04. The ACCC chairman, Graeme Samuel,",127
NA,was quoted as saying:,127
NA,Higher average revenues-,127
NA,"that is, increased profits for the government's",127
NA,favoured friends at Patrick and P&O-,127
NA,mean that users are facing higher charges for ste-,127
NA,vedoring services.,127
NA,The government likes to boast that its water-,127
NA,front reforms have greatly increased produc-,127
NA,"tivity in the stevedoring industry, but the",127
NA,ACCC report shows that Australia's ports,127
NA,urgently need new investment to increase,127
NA,capacity and reduce costs for exporters. In,127
NA,"other words, the cosy duopoly that Patrick",127
NA,and P&O enjoy in the stevedoring industry,127
NA,has allowed them to increase their rate of,127
NA,profit rather than investing some of their in-,127
NA,"come in increased capacity, which would",127
NA,benefit Australian exporters as well as pro-,127
NA,vide greater employment to waterfront com-,127
NA,munities such as those in Melbourne Ports.,127
NA,According to the article:,127
NA,... margins in the stevedoring industry had risen in,127
NA,each of the six years since the ACCC commenced,127
NA,monitoring.,127
NA,The article quotes Mr Samuel:,127
NA,If the industry is beginning to experience ca-,127
NA,pacity constraints then it is important from a,127
NA,competition perspective to see new investment ...,127
NA,"This would expand capacity, alleviate congestion",127
NA,and ensure maintenance of service levels.,127
NA,"In other words, the selfish profit-taking of",127
NA,the government's corporate mates is starving,127
NA,the industry of investment and pushing up,127
NA,costs for Australian exporters. Since these,127
NA,include our great agricultural exporting in-,127
NA,"dustries, I thought we might have heard",127
NA,something from The Nationals about this.,127
NA,Instead over the last few years we have heard,127
NA,from the Deputy Prime Minister and Minis-,127
NA,"ter for Transport and Regional Services, who",127
NA,has come in here and rabbited on about the,127
NA,government's reform of Australia's ports.,127
NA,"However, the trickle-down effect of his so-",127
NA,called microeconomic reform has not been,127
NA,"happening at all, as I and many other mem-",127
NA,"bers on this side have pointed out to him, as",127
NA,has the Australian shipping and export indus-,127
NA,try. We will continue to pursue this matter,127
NA,with the government.,127
NA,"In the last parliament, I had the honour of",127
NA,serving as Deputy Chairman of the Joint,127
NA,Standing Committee on Electoral Matters,127
NA,under the chairmanship of the honourable,127
NA,member for Kooyong. If I am again a mem-,127
NA,"ber of this committee, which I hope to be, it",128
NA,will be a busy year for us. We have already,128
NA,"seen Senator Abetz, the Special Minister for",128
NA,"State, indicate that he intends reintroducing",128
NA,the government's electoral legislation which,128
NA,was rejected by the Senate in the last parlia-,128
NA,"ment. His bill would, amongst other things,",128
NA,close the electoral roll on the day the election,128
NA,is announced rather than allowing voters a,128
NA,week's grace to update their addresses or to,128
NA,enrol for the first time. We know-this is not,128
NA,a matter of speculation-that this would,128
NA,have the effect of disenfranchising about,128
NA,"300,000 Australians.",128
NA,I spoke about this matter at length in the,128
NA,last session and no doubt I will do so again. I,128
NA,only want to say now that this is a blatant,128
NA,piece of electoral manipulation by this gov-,128
NA,ernment. It is designed to keep many young,128
NA,"people-there are 70,000 young people",128
NA,"amongst those 300,000-and transient and",128
NA,low-income people off the rolls. It is the,128
NA,"government's belief-a poll-driven belief, if",128
NA,"you ask me-that, integrated with its happi-",128
NA,ness at the increasing number of people who,128
NA,"are voting informally, and its failure to get",128
NA,the AEC to pursue those who do not partici-,128
NA,"pate at all, which number has also gone up",128
NA,"slightly over the last few years, it will get",128
NA,some electoral benefit out of this. In particu-,128
NA,"lar, the prospect of disenfranchising people at",128
NA,the next election is designed on the belief,128
NA,that they would vote Labor rather than Lib-,128
NA,"eral. In doing this, the government is ignor-",128
NA,ing the unanimous report of the Joint Stand-,128
NA,ing Committee on Electoral Matters that,128
NA,such a move is not necessary. The supposed,128
NA,concern about the integrity of the electoral,128
NA,system which Senator Abetz cites as the rea-,128
NA,son for this change is no more than a smoke-,128
NA,screen for the self-interest of the Liberal,128
NA,Party.,128
NA,"It is ironic that, while this government is",128
NA,busy looking for ways to restrict democratic,128
NA,"participation in Australia, democratic free-",128
NA,doms are expanding in other countries. This,128
NA,year more people around the world voted in,128
NA,free elections than at any other time in hu-,128
NA,man history. Amongst them were the long-,128
NA,"suffering people of Afghanistan, who in Oc-",128
NA,tober-to their great credit-at the same,128
NA,"time as the Australian elections, elected their",128
NA,"first-ever freely elected leader, President",128
NA,"Hamid Karzai, who polled 55.4 per cent of",128
NA,the vote. Despite Taliban and al-Qaeda,128
NA,"threats, more than 10 million Afghans",128
NA,voted-three million more than were ex-,128
NA,pected. The United Nations believed that,128
NA,Afgans would be too afraid to enrol. But the,128
NA,courage of the Afghan people in enrolling,128
NA,and participating in this election in such a,128
NA,large measure was a great tribute to them.,128
NA,This was a remarkable achievement in one of,128
NA,"the world's poorest countries, until recently",128
NA,ruled by one of the most oppressive regimes,128
NA,in modern history. It was striking that the,128
NA,turnout amongst women was nearly as high,128
NA,as amongst men.,128
NA,"This progress in Afghanistan, in which",128
NA,Australian forces played a modest but credit-,128
NA,"able role, is in sharp contrast to the situation",128
NA,in most of the Islamic world. Although we in,128
NA,Australia are very pleased to see Indonesia,128
NA,has made great strides towards democracy,128
NA,with its first direct presidential election this,128
NA,"year, most of the countries in the Middle",128
NA,East still remain dictatorships or absolute,128
NA,monarchies. Last year's parliamentary elec-,128
NA,"tions in Iran, for example, were in my view a",128
NA,complete farce. The striking out of many,128
NA,"democratic candidates-in fact, sitting mem-",128
NA,bers of parliament-by some faceless group,128
NA,of mullahs was a disgrace to Tehran's claim,128
NA,to democracy. Pakistan is ruled by the mili-,128
NA,tary behind the facade of a parliamentary,128
NA,"government and, unfortunately, the same has",128
NA,happened in what was formerly Soviet Cen-,128
NA,tral Asia.,128
NA,All of this makes the elections in Iraq,128
NA,scheduled for January 2005 extremely im-,128
NA,portant. Most of the bloodshed in Iraq at the,129
NA,moment is part of a campaign to prevent,129
NA,these elections taking place. This campaign,129
NA,is usually depicted as resistance against the,129
NA,"US and allied forces in Iraq. In fact, in my",129
NA,"view, it is mainly intended to intimidate the",129
NA,Iraqi people by a minority who have tradi-,129
NA,tionally been able to control that country.,129
NA,Those regimes behind this insurgency minor-,129
NA,"ity, particularly the regimes of Iran and",129
NA,"Syria, know that a successful election and",129
NA,inauguration of democratic Iraq would be a,129
NA,grave threat to their own hold on power.,129
NA,These are views that I know are shared by,129
NA,"the new Iraqi Ambassador to Australia, Am-",129
NA,"bassador Al Shildu, whom I had the honour",129
NA,to meet at a lunch hosted by the Governor-,129
NA,General following his credentialling. Support,129
NA,for the elections is a view shared by many,129
NA,Iraqi professionals who live in Australia and,129
NA,who work under the Iraqi Forum trying to,129
NA,encourage Australian support for democracy,129
NA,in Iraq.,129
NA,It is so important that these elections go,129
NA,"ahead on schedule, and that democratic",129
NA,countries give Iraq as much help as possible,129
NA,in conducting these elections and establish-,129
NA,ing a freely elected government. An inde-,129
NA,pendent authentic elected Iraq government,129
NA,will be the best way of getting foreign troops,129
NA,out of Iraq. The project of building a democ-,129
NA,ratic Iraq is important for not only the long-,129
NA,suffering people of Iraq but also for the ex-,129
NA,ample it will set to the whole region. If,129
NA,be done in Afghanistan in the face of enor-,129
NA,"mous difficulties, it can be done in Iraq. I",129
NA,"believe Ayatollah Sistani, the Shia leader of",129
NA,the 60 per cent of Iraqis who follow the Shia,129
NA,"form of religion, wants the elections to go",129
NA,ahead as scheduled. I believe they should go,129
NA,ahead as soon as possible to enable people to,129
NA,reflect the democratic will of that country.,129
NA,Nothing will do more to diminish the suicide,129
NA,bombings and the terrorism that are taking,129
NA,"place there, than a successful election.",129
NA,The government argued during the elec-,129
NA,tion campaign that Australia should stay in,129
NA,Iraq until the job is done and now it has a,129
NA,mandate for that policy. So it is fair to ask,129
NA,what the government is now doing in prac-,129
NA,tice to help the Iraqi people for their first free,129
NA,elections next year. We have great experience,129
NA,in electoral systems and we have assisted our,129
NA,friends and neighbours in East Timor and,129
NA,Cambodia to establish efficient and transpar-,129
NA,ent election systems; we should be doing the,129
NA,same to help Iraq in the run-up to the 2005,129
NA,elections.,129
NA,Elections are also scheduled for the presi-,129
NA,dency of the Palestinian Authority in Janu-,129
NA,ary. I make no secret of my belief that over,129
NA,the past four years the greatest obstacle to,129
NA,achieving a peace settlement in the Middle,129
NA,East was the obstructionism of the late,129
NA,"Yasser Arafat, whose rejection of the Barak-",129
NA,Clinton peace offer in 2000 triggered the,129
NA,current tragic train of events in that small but,129
NA,vital part of the world. His death creates new,129
NA,opportunities to get the peace process mov-,129
NA,ing again. Again it is elections that lead to,129
NA,this possibility-elections in the Palestinian,129
NA,Authority. Many people argue that it is ter-,129
NA,"rorism, impoverishment and Western policy",129
NA,that lead to the extreme politics in that part,129
NA,of the world. I think that when people have,129
NA,the opportunity for a free expression of,129
NA,views they overcome those kinds of extreme,129
NA,political attitudes that we have seen in that,129
NA,it can region for so long. We should welcome,129
NA,Prime Minister Sharon's plan to withdraw,129
NA,"from Gaza, and we should encourage the",129
NA,Palestinians to respond in the same spirit.,129
NA,Australia should do whatever we can to as-,129
NA,sist both parties to resume negotiations.,129
NA,During this parliament I will continue to,129
NA,work for the people of Melbourne Ports. I,129
NA,will continue to raise issues such as electoral,129
NA,"reform, national security, human rights in",129
NA,many parts of the world and the govern-,129
NA,ment's callous treatment of asylum seekers.,129
NA,The voters have decided that Labor should,130
NA,"spend another term in opposition, and we",130
NA,have to accept that verdict. That does not,130
NA,"mean, however, that we should not continue",130
NA,to expose injustices as we see them and,130
NA,speak out in this House on behalf of our con-,130
NA,stituents. Over the next three years we have,130
NA,to work harder to develop policies that will,130
NA,win the confidence of voters at the next elec-,130
NA,"tion. In the meantime, we will hold this gov-",130
NA,ernment to account.,130
NA,I conclude by taking up some of the words,130
NA,"of the new member for Prospect, which are",130
NA,very much like Prime Minister Blair's views,130
NA,in the United Kingdom: we have to look at,130
NA,the democratic prospect throughout the,130
NA,world as not just economic development but,130
NA,as a way of-particularly in that troubled,130
NA,area of the Middle East-solving problems,130
NA,as much as creating them. I really look for-,130
NA,ward to the elections in Iraq as a way of,130
NA,"ing those people in that part of the world,",130
NA,bringing greater human rights to it and un-,130
NA,dermining the very basis on which a minority,130
NA,of people in that part of the world would de-,130
NA,prive their own people as much as us of their,130
NA,freedoms via terrorism. We have a lot of,130
NA,"work to do in this parliament, and I hope the",130
NA,government's democratic rhetoric is as valid,130
NA,as it says it is both in its assistance to the,130
NA,"people of Iraq and in this country, where",130
NA,there are some moves that it seems to have,130
NA,initiated to limit democratic freedoms.,130
Mr SECKER ,Barker) (7.33 p.m.)-It is,130
NA,always a pleasure to follow the member for,130
NA,Melbourne Ports. He actually makes quite a,130
NA,"bit of sense, certainly on foreign affairs",130
NA,"ters, and I think this parliament would be",130
NA,much better if he had more influence on the,130
NA,Labor Party's policy when it came to foreign,130
NA,affairs. I certainly think what he said about,130
NA,"Iraq, Palestine and Israel made a lot of sense,",130
NA,and anyone who listened to it would have,130
NA,seen that it was a very reasoned argument.,130
NA,"So it is always a pleasure to follow him, even",130
NA,though I may not agree with him on what he,130
NA,"said on electoral matters, because I remem-",130
NA,"ber many years ago when the Labor Party,",130
NA,"under the guise of many different reasons,",130
NA,brought the age for voting down from 21 to,130
NA,"18, and I am sure that was simply a reverse",130
NA,of what the member for Melbourne Ports was,130
NA,saying about young people voting. All I say,130
NA,about that is that perhaps we need to look in,130
NA,mirrors to see what is fair to all concerned.,130
NA,"Before I proceed, I congratulate you, Mr",130
NA,"Deputy Speaker Quick, on your rise to this",130
NA,position. It is a pleasure to see someone like,130
NA,you in the chair. I know we will always get a,130
NA,fair deal from you. One thing I can say about,130
NA,this election and certainly the three years,130
NA,"before the election is that, time after time, I",130
NA,would go and see people and the big thing,130
NA,they remembered about the Labor Party was,130
NA,the high interest rates. People do have long,130
NA,"freememories in this country, and signing a big",130
NA,cardboard cheque to say ‘we will keep inter-,130
NA,est rates down' just did not wash. I know,130
NA,"many of my friends, and certainly acquaint-",130
NA,"ances, lost farms and businesses, and if they",130
NA,did manage to struggle through it often took,130
NA,"them two, three or four years to get over that",130
NA,"high interest rate cycle, and they do remem-",130
NA,ber. That was always one of the Labor,130
NA,"Party's weaknesses, and I do not think we",130
NA,should apologise as a party for actually say-,130
NA,ing that people should remember that interest,130
NA,rates have always been higher under the La-,130
NA,bor Party.,130
NA,I noticed in recent weeks a former Prime,130
NA,"Minister, Paul Keating, saying that the Labor",130
NA,matParty should embrace the goals that he had,130
NA,as Treasurer and Prime Minister to modern-,130
NA,ise the country. I have often said that they,130
NA,"did do some good things, but the big differ-",130
NA,ence between us and them is that in 1996,130
NA,they would not have made the changes that,130
NA,we made when we came into government.,130
NA,They would not have made the cuts that we,130
NA,made to spending so that we could get the,130
NA,budget deficit under control. It is a matter of,131
NA,interest in Australian history that in the 90,131
NA,years since Federation in 1901 we accumu-,131
NA,lated a total federal debt of $16 billion. In,131
NA,"those 90 years we had two world wars, the",131
NA,"Depression, the Korean War, the Vietnam",131
NA,"War, the building of a national capital and",131
NA,lots of infrastructure to build as a country-,131
NA,yet we only accumulated $16 billion in debt.,131
NA,"But that $16 billion was increased, on aver-",131
NA,"age, by the same amount each year for the",131
NA,next five years.,131
NA,From 1991 to 1996 federal government,131
NA,debt went from $16 billion net to $96 billion.,131
NA,"Of course, we have repaid more than $60",131
NA,billion of that Labor debt. I do not think,131
NA,one in their faintest dreams would have,131
NA,"thought that, if a Labor government were",131
NA,"elected in 1996, they would have taken that",131
NA,action. They did not have the form. They,131
NA,were prepared to continue to allow our na-,131
NA,tional debt to increase. One of the great,131
NA,benefits of reducing that debt by over $60,131
NA,"billion-in fact, we have reduced it by nearly",131
NA,$70 billion-is that as a nation we now have,131
NA,$5½ billion extra to spend every year forever,131
NA,"and ever. We can spend that on health, edu-",131
NA,cation and infrastructure. That money will be,131
NA,"there forever and ever, unless this country",131
NA,gets another Labor government which starts,131
NA,to run up debt.,131
NA,"The Howard government, with Peter",131
NA,"Costello as Treasurer, has continued to re-",131
NA,"duce debt, has continued to deliver surplus",131
NA,"budgets, has got interest rates down, has got",131
NA,unemployment down and has got the dragon,131
NA,of inflation under control. Obviously when a,131
NA,"government such as ours does all that, it is",131
NA,hard for any opposition party to make any,131
NA,inroads. But I will leave it to the Labor,131
NA,to recriminate about ordinary campaigning,131
NA,and policies which certainly did not work,131
NA,and did not connect with the Australian peo-,131
NA,ple.,131
NA,I want to take this opportunity tonight to,131
NA,share with the House some of the things that,131
NA,I believe led to the re-election of the gov-,131
NA,ernment and my re-election as the member,131
NA,for Barker. I was very pleased with the swing,131
NA,I received in South Australia in the seat of,131
NA,Barker. I know probably a fair bit of that is,131
NA,"due to our government's record, but I am",131
NA,"pleased to say that, for the second election in",131
NA,"a row, I received the biggest swing in South",131
NA,Australia. That is pleasing personally. We,131
NA,had a mixed result in South Australia. We,131
NA,"lost two and we won two, but I am very",131
NA,pleased with the result because I think we,131
NA,were under the gun. There is no doubt that,131
NA,anythe Rann Labor government in South Austra-,131
NA,"lia is reasonably popular, but there was still a",131
NA,half a per cent swing to the coalition in this,131
NA,election. I think the vote we received in,131
NA,South Australia was the second highest vote,131
NA,for the coalition anywhere in Australia. That,131
NA,we can return eight seats out of 11 in a state,131
NA,like South Australia is a pretty good result.,131
NA,We were very close to returning nine out of,131
NA,"11, and it would not take much more to actu-",131
NA,ally return 10 out of 11. That is not through,131
NA,any electoral gerrymandering; it is due to the,131
NA,"fact that, in South Australia, we are getting",131
NA,over 55 per cent of the two-party preferred,131
NA,vote. And we do have some very effective,131
NA,and good ministers that come from South,131
NA,Australia. We have the likes of the member,131
NA,"for Mayo, the Minister for Foreign Affairs,",131
NA,"and Senator Robert Hill, the Minister for",131
NA,Defence. Senator Amanda Vanstone is an-,131
NA,other minister.,131
Dr NELSON ,And there is the minister for,131
NA,finance.,131
Mr SECKER,"Of course, Nick Minchin.",131
NA,Party How could I forget Senator Nick Minchin?,131
NA,We have four members of cabinet-equal,131
NA,membership to New South Wales and Victo-,131
NA,ria. So we in South Australia are batting,131
NA,above our weight in the Liberal Party. It is,131
NA,very pleasing that we have some very good,132
NA,representation in South Australia.,132
NA,"Over the past three years, the Howard",132
NA,government has had many wins and has pro-,132
NA,vided much for the Australian people. Within,132
NA,"my electorate of Barker, the government's",132
NA,commitment to regional Australia has en-,132
NA,abled me as a member of the coalition to,132
NA,deliver beneficial outcomes on a range of,132
NA,issues which have assisted the constituents in,132
NA,Barker. Tonight I will inform the House of,132
NA,these achievements and happenings and also,132
NA,give the House some insight into my plans,132
NA,for Barker over the next term of government.,132
NA,"However, before I do that, I would like to",132
NA,extend my thanks to the hardworking Barker,132
NA,campaign team. Their dedication and assis-,132
NA,tance helped me to return to serve the people,132
NA,of Barker for a third term as a member of,132
NA,this House. This fantastic team has seen the,132
NA,electorate of Barker returned to the Liberal,132
NA,"Party-and returned in fine form, as I men-",132
NA,tioned earlier. We experienced a swing of 3.2,132
NA,per cent in the electorate of Barker. We won,132
NA,"103 of the 108 booths, and I think three of",132
NA,"the others were won by The Nationals. So,",132
NA,"overall, I think the coalition won all but two",132
NA,"booths, and in one of those booths there were",132
NA,"about 48 votes in it. For the first time, I am",132
NA,almost pleased to say that I actually came,132
NA,pretty close in the booth of Nangwarry. I do,132
NA,not think we had got much over about 34 per,132
NA,"cent since Federation, and Barker is a Fed-",132
NA,eration seat. In this election we had a two-,132
NA,party preferred vote of over 48 per cent. That,132
NA,"was an amazing result, but one has to look at",132
NA,why we got that result. Nangwarry is a for-,132
NA,"estry town, and there is no doubt that they",132
NA,did not like the Labor Party's forestry policy.,132
NA,The results that we received in the elec-,132
NA,torate of Barker were the culmination of,132
NA,months of hard work by my wonderful team,132
NA,both prior to and during the election. Their,132
NA,commitment was just fantastic and their loy-,132
NA,alty was unwavering. I consider myself most,132
NA,fortunate to have such a fantastic team. My,132
NA,"campaign manager, the Hon. David Ridgway",132
NA,"MLC, worked tirelessly on this campaign.",132
NA,Balancing his commitments as a member of,132
NA,the South Australia Legislative Council with,132
NA,his family commitments and his commit-,132
NA,ments to the Barker campaign was no easy,132
NA,task. He has been a mate of mine for many,132
NA,years. I have helped him and he helped me,132
NA,this time around. I am very grateful for the,132
NA,effort that he put in. He made himself avail-,132
NA,able at all times and he certainly did take a,132
NA,load off my shoulders.,132
NA,In our campaign committee we had mem-,132
NA,bers from all over the electorate. It is an elec-,132
NA,"torate of 64,000 square kilometres. Mr Dep-",132
NA,"uty Speaker Quick, it is nearly the size of",132
NA,"your state of Tasmania, so you can imagine",132
NA,trying to represent that area-the amount of,132
NA,"people involved, and trying to coordinate",132
NA,them. I had some fantastic people. There was,132
NA,"my FEC chair, Anne Bell, and her husband,",132
NA,Graham. We had people like Roger Saunders,132
NA,"from Mount Gambier, Stephanie Martin from",132
NA,"the Barossa, Draz Barick and Kent Andrew",132
NA,"from the Riverland, and Damien MCQueen",132
NA,from Murray Bridge. They were fantastic.,132
NA,There are distances of 500 kilometres be-,132
NA,"tween some of those people, so you can",132
NA,imagine the logistics of getting them to-,132
NA,gether.,132
NA,I would especially like to thank my lovely,132
NA,"wife, Sharon, who is the best thing that has",132
NA,ever happened to me. Her positive and vi-,132
NA,"brant attitude around the place, and her total",132
NA,"support and commitment, not only during the",132
NA,"campaign but also over the last few years,",132
NA,has been one of those wonderful things.,132
NA,"Members of this parliament, when they have",132
NA,"that sort of support, know how lucky they",132
NA,are. I have no doubt that Sharon won a few,132
NA,votes for me because she is a very vibrant,132
NA,and attractive person who naturally gets on,132
NA,well with people. She certainly has a lot of,132
NA,"strength, and her support was second to",133
NA,none.,133
NA,I would also like to thank my staff mem-,133
NA,"bers Philippa, Vanessa, Leeanne, Karen and",133
NA,Alecia-a couple of them part time-who,133
NA,worked tirelessly throughout the campaign.,133
NA,They were often there at almost daybreak,133
NA,and leaving at midnight. That is the sort of,133
NA,"support and loyalty I had from my staff, and",133
NA,I do not think anyone could wish for better.,133
NA,"Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would be",133
NA,"aware, election campaigns come at a great",133
NA,cost. I would like to take this opportunity to,133
NA,publicly thank those who lent their financial,133
NA,support to my campaign. Their generosity is,133
NA,greatly appreciated. Just as they have dem-,133
NA,onstrated their faith in me as their parliamen-,133
NA,"tary representative, I would like to express",133
NA,my faith in the businesses and individuals in,133
NA,the seat of Barker.,133
NA,"Lastly, and with incessant appreciation, I",133
NA,would like to thank the Liberal Party,133
NA,"branches of Barker. Their assistance, both",133
NA,"financially and on the ground, was the life-",133
NA,"blood of this campaign. As I said, Barker is a",133
NA,very large electorate-it has 108 polling,133
NA,booths-so we rely heavily on the loyalty,133
NA,and commitment of our volunteers and party,133
NA,members. I think something like 400 of our,133
NA,"members worked on the polls during the day,",133
NA,and they certainly assisted the Liberal cause,133
NA,"in Barker. They organised fundraisers, put up",133
NA,"corflutes, set up polling packs and even",133
NA,"campaigned beside me. Last, but by no",133
NA,"means least, they gave up their time on Sat-",133
NA,"urday, 9 October to man those polling",133
NA,booths. I know that all members of parlia-,133
NA,"ment rely on that support, but I am amazed at",133
NA,what support they give the Liberal Party. I,133
NA,am sure I speak for all members in saying,133
NA,that the Howard government has been re-,133
NA,turned to this House for a fourth term as a,133
NA,result of that dedicated support from our,133
NA,supporters.,133
NA,"I think we are a positive, forward-thinking",133
NA,party and that the Howard government was,133
NA,obviously a stable choice for the Australian,133
NA,people. It was a hard-fought election. It was,133
NA,well won by the coalition. I think our elec-,133
NA,tion policies reflected the needs of the Aus-,133
NA,tralian people. Strong policies and good rep-,133
NA,"resentation win elections, and we had both of",133
NA,these things. I think the election policies of,133
NA,this government really hit a chord with the,133
NA,voters in my electorate. I was very pleased to,133
NA,get $219 million committed for road freight,133
NA,under Auslink. Roads infrastructure is very,133
NA,important for an electorate like mine. On top,133
NA,"of that, the Roads to Recovery program has",133
NA,been very popular-and I am sure the Dep-,133
NA,uty Speaker would say the same thing. In,133
NA,South Australia it has probably been more,133
NA,popular than anywhere else in Australia be-,133
NA,cause we got the biggest increase in roads,133
NA,grants funding-118 per cent for every,133
NA,council in South Australia. That meant a,133
NA,huge amount for local roads as well as na-,133
NA,tional highways. I think we need to contrast,133
NA,that with the state government in South Aus-,133
NA,tralia. The Commonwealth gives something,133
NA,like $100 million to local government in,133
NA,South Australia. Even in Western Australia,133
NA,and Queensland the state governments give,133
NA,$63 million and $62 million respectively to,133
NA,local governments for local roads. What does,133
NA,the South Australian state government give?,133
NA,"A pathetic $800,000. They are by far the",133
NA,worst funders of roads infrastructure of any,133
NA,state in Australia. You can see many of the,133
NA,"roads crumbling before your eyes, because",133
NA,they are not spending money on roads where,133
NA,it needs to be spent.,133
NA,One of the most important responsibilities,133
NA,of any government is looking after the health,133
NA,and welfare of the Australian people. The,133
NA,coalition has delivered results for Australia-,133
NA,"and, more specifically, for my electorate of",133
NA,Barker-through the Medicare safety net,133
NA,introduced in March this year. That is pretty,133
NA,"important for an electorate like mine, which",134
NA,has a low bulk-billing rate because it does,134
NA,not have competition between doctors. One,134
NA,of our problems has been getting doctors out,134
NA,into rural areas. That is one thing I know we,134
NA,have improved quite substantially since we,134
NA,"have been in government. But, because we",134
NA,"do not have the competition, we do not have",134
NA,doctors giving the bulk-billing rates that,134
NA,"some of us would like. As a result of that, the",134
NA,Medicare safety net has been fantastic. I,134
NA,think it has been the most fantastic im-,134
NA,provement in the 20-year history of the,134
NA,"Medicare system. It is now a stronger, more",134
NA,robust system which protects the Australian,134
NA,people from high medical expenses beyond,134
NA,the door of their local GP.,134
NA,It certainly has been well received. Over,134
NA,"the last eight months over 3,000 of my con-",134
NA,stituents have benefited from the new sys-,134
NA,"tem. At last count there were 23,100 families",134
NA,in my electorate who have reached the safety,134
NA,net threshold. I know they had greater peace,134
NA,of mind now that they know most of their,134
NA,"medical costs, whatever they are for, will be",134
NA,covered. It gives a lot of peace of mind and,134
NA,security. I think it is very fair for an electorspeak,134
NA,ate like mine. One of the things that most,134
NA,grabbed the imagination in my electorate,134
NA,was the technical high schools-everyone,134
NA,wants one. I know there are only two in,134
NA,"South Australia, but we want a lot more as",134
NA,well. (Time expired),134
Ms ROXON ,Gellibrand) (7.53 p.m.)-It,134
NA,is very difficult not to respond to the last,134
NA,"statement of the previous speaker, the hon-",134
NA,"ourable member for Barker, because it is one",134
NA,of the great disappointments of the re-,134
NA,election of the Howard government that,134
NA,there may be some policies that people are,134
NA,"keen on, but if the government cannot de-",134
NA,liver them in the areas where they are,134
NA,"needed-my electorate, the electorate of",134
NA,Barker and others-these big-scale promises,134
NA,are not going to turn into anything much.,134
NA,This is instead of putting that money into a,134
NA,"system that exists, and services our commu-",134
NA,"nities, but is underfunded. I do not want to be",134
NA,"too distracted, because with this opportunity",134
NA,for the address-in-reply we obviously get to,134
NA,cover a range of issues.,134
NA,"I would like to focus on two things: firstly,",134
NA,some issues for my electorate of Gellibrand,134
NA,"and, secondly, some important issues that are",134
NA,going to feature in the ongoing debate of the,134
NA,next three years about the way our govern-,134
NA,"ment is structured and, in particular, my role",134
NA,as shadow Attorney-General. These are the,134
NA,sorts of things that will become increasingly,134
NA,important in holding the government to ac-,134
NA,count in a range of areas.,134
NA,I want to take this as my first opportunity,134
NA,to thank the people of Gellibrand for re-,134
NA,electing me for a third time. It is obviously a,134
NA,great honour for all of us to be elected. It,134
NA,shows great trust in us as representatives,134
NA,when communities re-elect us several times.,134
NA,It has been wonderful to listen to a number,134
NA,of first speeches today from new members,134
NA,on both sides of the House. They obviously,134
NA,feel the honour acutely when they rise to,134
NA,in this place for the first time. It is,134
NA,"something that never leaves us, and it never",134
NA,"should, because we have the responsibility of",134
NA,"representing over 100,000 people each-it is",134
NA,"about 120,000 in my electorate-who see us",134
NA,as their conduit to this national capital. The,134
NA,issues they are interested in and they care,134
NA,about which affect their lives can and must,134
NA,be raised here by us. It is an obligation and,134
NA,an honour that I take very seriously.,134
NA,It is with some regret in making this,134
NA,speech that I note how strongly the commu-,134
NA,nity in Gellibrand endorsed Labor's policies,134
NA,"at this election-in particular, I think, our",134
NA,direction on health and education was some-,134
NA,thing that many people in the community,134
NA,could see offered them a great alternative to,134
NA,the system they are currently under and the,134
NA,pressures they are currently feeling. That we,135
NA,were not elected as a whole across the coun-,135
NA,try is a great disappointment not just for us,135
NA,on this side of the House but also for those,135
NA,many people who voted for us and our policy,135
NA,"agenda, who will not see it implemented and",135
NA,"will not get the benefits of those policies, as",135
NA,would have happened in my electorate.,135
NA,"In particular, I am disappointed that we",135
NA,cannot deliver on some of the vital services,135
NA,"that are much needed in Gellibrand, where",135
NA,we committed to better funding of our,135
NA,schools. I have lots of government schools,135
NA,and low-fee Catholic schools in my elector-,135
NA,"ate, and one independent school with moder-",135
NA,ate fees. No school in my electorate would,135
NA,"have been worse off under our policy, and",135
NA,many of the schools-probably with the ex-,135
NA,ception of one-would have been far better,135
NA,off. Schools from Altona Meadows Primary,135
NA,School to the Maribyrnong Secondary Col-,135
NA,"lege, to the Footscray City College and Wil-",135
NA,liamstown High School are very good,135
NA,schools that really need some extra resources,135
NA,to be able to give the education of our kids in,135
NA,that area an extra edge.,135
NA,I am pleased that the Minister for Educa-,135
NA,"tion, Science and Training is here at the ta-",135
NA,ble-quite by chance-while I am delivering,135
NA,"my speech, because he would be acutely",135
NA,aware that regions like mine in Melbourne,135
NA,need extra assistance. They need to be able,135
NA,to accommodate students who come from all,135
NA,"different ethnic backgrounds, such as those",135
NA,from the very large refugee population who,135
NA,face challenges in English language when,135
NA,they start their schooling and many other,135
NA,challenges that make their lives a little more,135
NA,"difficult than others. For example, we have",135
NA,relatively low levels of home Internet usage.,135
NA,These are the sorts of things that affect a,135
NA,dent's day-to-day studying capacity but are,135
NA,not being dealt with by the government's,135
NA,funding policy for schools. The government,135
NA,is not putting extra resources into those,135
NA,schools that need it most. Those schools will,135
NA,"continue to do a good job by our kids, but",135
NA,they will do it with one hand tied behind,135
NA,their backs through lack of funding that,135
NA,would have been offered if Labor had been,135
NA,elected at the federal election.,135
NA,So that is a great disappointment. It is a,135
NA,"disappointment that, because of the re-",135
NA,"election of the Howard government, the extra",135
NA,$7 million of funding that would have gone,135
NA,to Victoria University will not. We will not,135
NA,have the better health and bulk-billing ser-,135
NA,"vices that were promised. In particular, La-",135
NA,bor was committed to ensuring that the west-,135
NA,ern region of Melbourne had a rebateable,135
NA,MRI machine for our public health services.,135
NA,It is extraordinary that a section of Mel-,135
NA,bourne that probably has a third of the popu-,135
NA,lation does not within its whole reach have,135
NA,an MRI machine that someone can go to and,135
NA,claim a Medicare rebate for. It means that the,135
NA,people with the most money can pay up front,135
NA,"to get those services, and those that cannot",135
NA,have to go on long waiting lists for other,135
NA,public facilities that are often difficult to get,135
NA,to. It is often frail and elderly patients who,135
NA,"need these services, who have to travel",135
NA,across town to get them and who often risk,135
NA,some other damage to their health.,135
NA,When an electorate like Gellibrand has,135
NA,voted for Labor at a ratio of about two to,135
NA,"one, it is obviously my strong obligation and",135
NA,"commitment, which I reaffirm here publicly",135
NA,"today, to continue to fight for those issues-",135
NA,whether or not it is from opposition. There is,135
NA,an important role for us to play in highlight-,135
NA,ing the inadequacies of the government's,135
NA,"policies, particularly for regions like mine,",135
NA,where we have an extra need for some inter-,135
NA,vention at the federal level and proper re-,135
NA,stusources in areas where there is serious disad-,135
NA,vantage.,135
NA,I know that many in the House are famil-,135
NA,"iar with the type of electorate I live in, but I",135
NA,want to put some statistics together. Thirty-,136
NA,six per cent of our population speaks a lan-,136
NA,guage other than English at home. We have a,136
NA,nearly 20 per cent-19.7 per cent-rate of,136
NA,youth unemployment and a 6.4 per cent gen-,136
NA,eral unemployment rate in western Mel-,136
NA,bourne. Everyone talks about how well the,136
NA,"economy is going, but I think it is important",136
NA,to acknowledge that not everyone is yet,136
NA,benefiting from the economy going well and,136
NA,that we do have an obligation to make sure,136
NA,that everyone gets a fair share of the benefits,136
NA,that are flowing through to the rest of the,136
NA,community.,136
NA,We have had a decline of about 10 per,136
NA,cent in bulk-billing rates in our electorate.,136
NA,Although compared to some other areas it is,136
NA,"still relatively high, that is a great difference.",136
NA,A large number of families have local doc-,136
NA,tors who are now no longer bulk-billing,136
NA,them. We are seeing a growing number of,136
NA,complaints on that issue. The re-election of,136
NA,the Howard government does not mean that,136
NA,these issues and needs can be ignored and,136
NA,"my job, obviously, is to make sure that they",136
NA,are not. We must ensure that the government,136
NA,"will govern for everyone, and that includes",136
NA,"the people in my electorate, many of whom",136
NA,are having a hard time.,136
NA,My job also reaches to holding the gov-,136
NA,"ernment to its election promises, and one of",136
NA,those promises was made in my electorate.,136
NA,That was a promise made during the election,136
NA,that the Howard government if re-elected,136
NA,would put $8 million into the Western Bull-,136
NA,dogs Football Club to help redevelop the,136
NA,famous Whitten Oval and to make sure that a,136
NA,range of community services could be deliv-,136
NA,ered through that redeveloped facility. The,136
NA,"people of the region, who are very passionate",136
NA,about their football and their football club-,136
NA,"as am I-were delighted that Mr Howard, in",136
NA,making his first trip out into the west of,136
NA,"Melbourne, decided to make this commit-",136
NA,ment to the club. But I must say that we are a,136
NA,little bit concerned that since the election,136
NA,there has been deafening silence on this,136
NA,commitment. The club has written to the,136
NA,"government, requesting confirmation and",136
NA,seeking advice as to any other processes that,136
NA,now need to be gone through and asking,136
NA,which department is administering the,136
NA,"money. I have written to the Prime Minister,",136
NA,trying to find out this information. We have,136
NA,had no response.,136
NA,I am very concerned that after all the fan-,136
NA,fare-and even people who were not in Vic-,136
NA,"toria would have seen the coverage, which",136
NA,"was saturation coverage on the night, of",136
NA,commitments being make to our football,136
NA,club-there has actually been no follow,136
NA,through yet. It has made a lot of people in,136
NA,our electorate nervous. I am hopeful that the,136
NA,government will quickly clarify its commit-,136
NA,"ment, acknowledge the advantage it clearly",136
NA,got in the election in many areas and make,136
NA,sure that it holds to its word.,136
NA,"Having sat through question time today, I",136
NA,was obviously also concerned that when Mr,136
NA,"Anderson, the Acting Prime Minister, was",136
NA,asked a range of questions about other re-,136
NA,gional projects he seemed to be suggesting,136
NA,that the election announcements that were,136
NA,made were only step 1 in the process and that,136
NA,the communities now should actually follow,136
NA,some other process as yet unknown to peo-,136
NA,ple. He seemed to be suggesting that the,136
NA,money that was promised under regional,136
NA,programs may not actually be there after all,136
NA,for these communities. I have no idea,136
NA,whether or not this commitment to the West-,136
NA,"ern Bulldogs Football Club, in my electorate,",136
NA,"is one of those projects. It is extraordinary,",136
NA,"really, that a commitment could be made",136
NA,without knowing that. But I am fearful that,136
NA,commitments to projects like mine in the,136
NA,electorate of Gellibrand are going to be bro-,136
NA,ken because the government has got the elec-,136
NA,toral advantage it was after and has no inten-,136
NA,tion of following through on them.,136
NA,I am here to tell the government that if,137
NA,they try to do that there will be a riot in,137
NA,western suburbs of Melbourne. It will be on,137
NA,the front page of every local paper. Every,137
NA,"local paper, all of the metropolitan papers",137
NA,and all of the TV stations that followed it,137
NA,will be chasing Mr Howard and Mr Ander-,137
NA,son-the Prime Minister and the Acting,137
NA,"Prime Minister-around, asking exactly",137
NA,what it was that they had committed to and if,137
NA,they were going to follow through now on,137
NA,the money or not. I am sure that the govern-,137
NA,ment intend to honour their commitment. I,137
NA,"hope that they do. Like the Bulldogs, we will",137
NA,all be looking very closely at every line in,137
NA,"the budget when we get to it next year, to",137
NA,ensure that the money is there for the pro-,137
NA,jects that they committed to.,137
NA,While I have been talking about pockets,137
NA,"of social disadvantage in Gellibrand, I also",137
NA,want to acknowledge that there are areas of,137
NA,new homeowners and people with very large,137
NA,"mortgages. In 2001, there were nearly 12,000",137
NA,mortgage holders in Gellibrand and there are,137
NA,growing numbers of young families. Obvi-,137
NA,"ously, with this change and with lots of hous-",137
NA,ing developments under way we are seeing,137
NA,that people with large debts have very real,137
NA,concerns. We must make sure that the gov-,137
NA,ernment is held accountable on its promise to,137
NA,keep interest rates low. But we also need to,137
NA,investigate more generally the issues sur-,137
NA,rounding affordability of home ownership.,137
NA,There are also other pressures that grow,137
NA,"when you have changing demographics, like",137
NA,the need for child care.,137
NA,There are a number of other local issues,137
NA,that are going to come up in the next year,137
NA,"that I will be following closely, particularly",137
NA,the situation of Tenix and the dockyards at,137
NA,Williamstown. They are still waiting for the,137
NA,government to decide what it is going to do,137
NA,about the future of shipbuilding in Australia.,137
NA,We still cannot get any guarantees that any,137
NA,tender process for shipbuilding will be fair,137
NA,"and open. In my view, that would give Wil-",137
NA,the liamstown the best chance of proving that it,137
NA,is the place to build Defence ships in Austra-,137
NA,"lia, being the only place where the Anzac",137
NA,frigates had been built over the past 10 years.,137
NA,The sale of the Maribyrnong Defence site is,137
NA,something about which there have been ne-,137
NA,gotiations between the Victorian government,137
NA,and the Commonwealth. We are still waiting,137
NA,for the Commonwealth to sign off on that.,137
NA,We also have growing pressures with our,137
NA,"environment-for example, on the rivers,",137
NA,particularly the Maribyrnong River and,137
NA,"Kororoit Creek and others, and also on our",137
NA,bay fronts in Williamstown and Altona. That,137
NA,will be something that I will be pursuing in,137
NA,this next term of opposition.,137
NA,In the time that is remaining I want to talk,137
NA,"about the issues in my portfolio, the shadow",137
NA,Attorney-General's portfolio. We have a spe-,137
NA,cial role in this area to ensure the integrity of,137
NA,our legal and civic institutions. It is always,137
NA,"important to do that, but the government has",137
NA,won control of the Senate and therefore both,137
NA,houses of parliament at this election and so,137
NA,some of the scrutiny that previously occurred,137
NA,in the parliament will actually have to occur,137
NA,outside the parliament. This will show that,137
NA,the strength of our other institutions is very,137
NA,important. Their robustness will be tested.,137
NA,We have had a lot of important inquiries,137
NA,"in the Senate in the past six to eight years,",137
NA,from inquiries into poverty and children in,137
NA,care to others like cash for visas and the,137
NA,‘children overboard' issue. They were impor-,137
NA,"tant opportunities for allegations to be tested,",137
NA,"for important social issues to be aired, for",137
NA,people to give their expertise to the parlia-,137
NA,ment and for us to make recommendations,137
NA,on those issues. I think it is very important,137
NA,that the Senate does not lose that role but in,137
NA,terms of the accountability that the Senate,137
NA,has been able to require from the executive,137
NA,government we may be looking to other arms,137
NA,of government to do that in a different way.,137
NA,I raise this because one of the things that,138
NA,we took to the last election was significant,138
NA,reform of the Freedom of Information Act.,138
NA,Those commitments are very important and,138
NA,"we remain interested in implementing them,",138
NA,but I think we need to go much further than,138
NA,that. We need to look at how else the system,138
NA,should be reformed so that government deci-,138
NA,"sions are transparent, so that the public are",138
NA,aware of all of the information at further,138
NA,"elections, or when involved in public debate,",138
NA,and they know the information that should be,138
NA,publicly available-because governments are,138
NA,actually elected to do work on behalf of the,138
NA,"public, not to operate as secret think tanks",138
NA,and not provide people with information and,138
NA,ideas that they may have gathered as a gov-,138
NA,ernment.,138
NA,I am a little bit fearful of a bill that has,138
NA,been introduced in the other place-because,138
NA,"of the timing of the new parliament, it has",138
NA,been introduced in the Senate first rather,138
NA,than in the House-which contains reforms,138
NA,to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I,138
NA,"raise this not to debate the detail of the bill,",138
NA,"which will be done at another time, but to",138
NA,"say that there are moves, as part of that",138
NA,"amendment, to downgrade the role of the",138
NA,Administrative Appeals Tribunal and particu-,138
NA,larly the role of the president. I think this,138
NA,of concern when you think about the types of,138
NA,matters that come before the Administrative,138
NA,Appeals Tribunal.,138
NA,This is where people who have a dispute,138
NA,with the government most often take their,138
NA,complaints. If you have a dispute with the,138
NA,"government over a social security issue, ap-",138
NA,peals from the Social Security Appeals Tri-,138
NA,bunal go to the Administrative Appeals Tri-,138
NA,bunal. It is the same for a dispute,138
NA,"erans' Affairs matter, a workers compensa-",138
NA,"tion issue in Comcare, a child support dis-",138
NA,pute or a freedom of information request that,138
NA,"is contested, and even for a number of issues",138
NA,"in the immigration and citizenship area. So,",138
NA,if members of the general public who are,138
NA,involved in decisions made by governments,138
NA,"have a problem, the place where they will",138
NA,most likely have to challenge the decision is,138
NA,the AAT.,138
NA,"I think it is worrying that, at the same time",138
NA,as we see the government gaining control of,138
NA,"the Senate, we also see them seeking to have",138
NA,more control of institutions like the AAT by,138
NA,downgrading the role of the president-,138
NA,removing tenure from the president so that,138
NA,they are potentially politically vulnerable if,138
NA,the decisions they make are not favourable to,138
NA,the government. This is something that we,138
NA,will need to monitor very closely. I hope that,138
NA,discussions with the government might lead,138
NA,"to some sensible developments in that area,",138
NA,which is why I do not want to go to the pro-,138
NA,"visions of the bill in detail, but I would like",138
NA,to flag that it is something that we regard,138
NA,very seriously as an accountability matter.,138
NA,We also think that we should have a dis-,138
NA,cussion about a better process for judicial,138
NA,appointments and complaints against the,138
NA,judiciary. People will remember the extraor-,138
NA,dinary attacks on some of our judiciary by,138
NA,this government in its last term. I think it,138
NA,highlighted the fact that we have no process,138
NA,for quickly dispensing with malicious or,138
NA,"is vexatious complaints. At the same time, it",138
NA,must be acknowledged that we also have no,138
NA,"process for dealing with serious complaints,",138
NA,and I think that is something that should be,138
NA,"explored. Again, these are things that I see as",138
NA,"strengthening the role of the judiciary, by",138
NA,making sure that each arm of government-,138
NA,"government with a small ‘g'; the legislature,",138
NA,the executive and the judiciary-can operate,138
NA,"to its full strength, free from the influence of",138
NA,over a Vet- the other arms of government.,138
NA,We also have some questions on issues,138
NA,that have been much debated in the last cou-,138
NA,ple of weeks about the appropriateness of,138
NA,government spending and decision making,138
NA,that relates to government funding. As alle-,139
NA,gations by the member for New England,139
NA,"have been explored, we have found that a",139
NA,whole range of other funding commitments,139
NA,are starting to unravel before us. The issue of,139
NA,propriety in procedural justice and the proc-,139
NA,esses that are used for allocating federal,139
NA,money are going to come under much closer,139
NA,scrutiny and indeed need to.,139
NA,I also want to talk about a range of issues,139
NA,to do with access to justice. I have put this,139
NA,"the record before, so I will just give a very",139
NA,short version because I would like to concen-,139
NA,trate on a couple of issues. The government,139
NA,have a very poor record on legal aid. They,139
NA,slashed enormous amounts of money from,139
NA,"the budget in 1996, and we are only getting",139
NA,"back to 1996 levels now, eight years later,",139
NA,but of course with some reductions because,139
NA,inflation was not taken into account.,139
NA,At the same time we have seen a boom in,139
NA,spending on legal services for the govern-,139
NA,ment. We need to much more closely con-,139
NA,sider how we track the money that the gov-,139
NA,ernment spends on legal services and,139
NA,whether we can divert some of that money,139
NA,"from government expenditure, and use tax-",139
NA,payer money to fund those ordinary mums,139
NA,and dads who need assistance in the courts-,139
NA,not to make sure that the department always,139
NA,has four opinions on the same issue and pays,139
NA,Sydney rates for them. There is no excuse for,139
NA,that. It is extraordinary to us that the gov-,139
NA,ernment does not know where a lot of its,139
NA,legal expenditure has gone. With modern,139
NA,"technology, tracking systems and accounting",139
NA,"processes, there is no excuse for that.",139
NA,"I wanted to flag some family law issues,",139
NA,but I think time will defeat me so I am just,139
NA,going to raise an issue about Aboriginal and,139
NA,Torres Strait Islander legal services. The,139
NA,government has started the first stage of ten-,139
NA,dering out these services in WA and Victoria.,139
NA,Although there have been some improve-,139
NA,ments to the extremely damaging tender,139
NA,document that was released earlier in the,139
NA,"year, there is still nothing in the tender",139
NA,document that allows the services to be paid,139
NA,for work in Aboriginal communities for the,139
NA,prevention of crime and for community edu-,139
NA,cation about legal issues; it is focused only,139
NA,"on legal work, case by case. This means that",139
NA,Aboriginal people will lose a range of ser-,139
NA,vices that they currently have under the,139
NA,on ATSILS program. I think it sets us back a,139
NA,long way if we deal with the problems only,139
NA,when they are already in court rather than in,139
NA,"a preventative way, which would be prefer-",139
NA,able. (Time expired),139
Mr CIOBO ,Moncrieff) (8.13 p.m.)-,139
NA,When I rose in this chamber for my first,139
NA,speech in the early evening of 13 February,139
NA,"nearly three years ago, I asked one question:",139
NA,what is our purpose? I indicated that I,139
NA,thought this question would underscore my,139
NA,actions and provide a compass for my jour-,139
NA,ney in this place. Having survived my first,139
NA,"term as the second member for Moncrieff, I",139
NA,am pleased to take the time to review the,139
NA,progress that has been made both in my elec-,139
NA,torate and also nationally under the steward-,139
NA,ship of the Howard government.,139
NA,There can be no doubt that standing for,139
NA,office for a second term is far less daunting,139
NA,than standing for the first time. The cam-,139
NA,"paign in Moncrieff in 2004 was an honest,",139
NA,"clean campaign, and I thank my opponents",139
NA,for their contribution in this regard. Although,139
NA,I fiercely disagree with most of them on the,139
NA,"path that they desire Australia to travel, I do",139
NA,applaud their commitment to being partici-,139
NA,pants in our robust democracy. I pay particu-,139
NA,lar tribute and give thanks to the electors of,139
NA,Moncrieff. I have a great appreciation for the,139
NA,"electors of Moncrieff, for they have certainly",139
NA,placed their faith and their confidence in me,139
NA,with regard to being not only a strong advo-,139
NA,cate but also a passionate advocate for our,139
NA,part of the world. It is indeed a privilege and,139
NA,"an honour to serve the people of Moncrieff,",140
NA,who live in Australia's fastest-growing city,140
NA,on the Gold Coast.,140
NA,As a consequence of boundary changes,140
NA,"prior to the last federal election, I saw some",140
NA,significant changes in my electorate. I lost,140
NA,"the suburbs of Parkwood, Arundel and Lab-",140
NA,"rador, most of Southport and parts of Nerang",140
NA,"to the member now to my immediate north,",140
NA,"the Hon. David Jull, the member for Fadden.",140
NA,"I did, however, pick up nearly 20,000 addi-",140
NA,tional constituents in the suburbs of Mermaid,140
NA,"Beach, Mermaid Waters, Miami, Nobbys and",140
NA,north Burleigh. I have been particularly,140
NA,"grateful to them, for they have embraced me",140
NA,and my advocacy on their behalf with regard,140
NA,to those parts of the central Gold Coast.,140
NA,"Overall, the Gold Coast is a city that faces",140
NA,unique challenges. I have certainly been able,140
NA,to glean a good indication of what a number,140
NA,of these challenges are as a consequence of,140
NA,my regular listening posts and the various,140
NA,works I have done in the community,140
NA,throughout my first term.,140
NA,I would like to take this chance to thank,140
NA,my campaign team who assisted me,140
NA,throughout the most recent campaign. I must,140
NA,"especially thank my incredibly loyal, dedi-",140
NA,cated and hardworking staff-Marianne,140
NA,"MCCabe, Tricia Walsh and Mark Powell-",140
NA,who I am sure for quite some time thought,140
NA,an eight-hour day only took you as far as,140
NA,lunchtime. I also have to thank Alastair,140
NA,"Mitchell, Jonathon Ellis, Sarah Allard, Peter",140
NA,Cantazariti and the Moncrieff campaign,140
NA,committee for their undying work on tasks,140
NA,which they completed in full because they,140
NA,knew the importance of ensuring all tasks for,140
NA,the campaign were done to put us on the best,140
NA,possible footing to ensure victory.,140
NA,I also must thank all of the volunteers.,140
NA,They contributed so much towards the cam-,140
NA,paign. Countless hours of work went into,140
NA,making sure the Liberal Party in Moncrieff,140
NA,was able to perform to the greatest possible,140
NA,extent. I thank my booth captains and all my,140
NA,prepoll volunteers who worked for the weeks,140
NA,"prior to polling day, especially my mother",140
NA,"and father, who put in an exorbitant amount",140
NA,of effort in this regard. I also have to thank,140
NA,the nearly 400 volunteers who turned out on,140
NA,polling day to assist not only my campaign,140
NA,but the Liberal Party's campaign. They did,140
NA,so because they have a resolute belief in the,140
NA,good governance of the Howard government,140
NA,and the path we as a government are taking,140
NA,this nation on.,140
NA,I also want to thank my financial support-,140
NA,ers. The reality is that modern day campaign-,140
NA,ing is notoriously expensive. While some,140
NA,people would obviously desire that politi-,140
NA,cians not have to incur any campaign dona-,140
NA,"tions at all, the reality is that campaigning is",140
NA,expensive and does require financial assis-,140
NA,tance and support. I cannot thank enough,140
NA,those people who were willing to contribute.,140
NA,"Whether it was $5 or more, each one of them",140
NA,made a significant contribution towards en-,140
NA,suring the Liberal Party performed not only,140
NA,in Moncrieff but also in a number of key,140
NA,marginal seats within Queensland.,140
NA,"Most of all, I cannot ever truly show my",140
NA,"appreciation and thanks to my wife, Astra,",140
NA,who truly does give meaning to my life and,140
NA,"educates me every single day. Her support,",140
NA,"her strength, her humour and her tenacity are",140
NA,"certainly inspiring to me, and I am forever",140
NA,grateful for her support and her inspiration.,140
NA,We saw a 3.8 per cent swing towards the,140
NA,"coalition in the seat of Moncrieff, which",140
NA,raises the question: why was that the case?,140
NA,"As I foreshadowed earlier, I believe it is fun-",140
NA,damentally because I and the Liberal Party,140
NA,"have listened, responded and, most impor-",140
NA,"tantly, delivered for the Gold Coast. As I out-",140
NA,"lined, through my community listening posts",140
NA,and my regular work in the community I,140
NA,have on a number of occasions heard people,140
NA,put forward the key issues that are out-,141
NA,standing in the community. Among them-,141
NA,"and perhaps first and foremost, as it was one",141
NA,I raised in my maiden speech-was the abso-,141
NA,lute need Griffith University on the Gold,141
NA,Coast had for additional university places. It,141
NA,"is fortuitous that the Minister for Education,",141
NA,"Science and Training, Dr Brendan Nelson, is",141
NA,in the chamber this evening. I thank him for,141
NA,"his tireless efforts and, importantly, his",141
NA,lar visits to the Gold Coast to hear the very,141
NA,sound arguments that were put forward by,141
NA,Griffith University for additional university,141
NA,places.,141
NA,Dr Nelson interjecting-,141
Mr CIOBO,I am pleased to hear that,141
NA,the education minister recognised how com-,141
NA,"pelling they truly were, and I was very",141
NA,"pleased that, in fact, the highest allocation of",141
NA,new university places across the nation was,141
NA,to the Griffith University Gold Coast cam-,141
NA,pus. There can be no doubt that in Australia's,141
NA,fastest-growing city there is an absolute need,141
NA,"for more university places, and whilst we",141
NA,certainly did make a very large dent in the,141
NA,shortfall that exists on a per capita basis,141
NA,there is still much work to be done. I reaffirm,141
NA,in this chamber tonight that I will continue to,141
NA,pursue the allocation of additional university,141
NA,places.,141
NA,"When I was initially elected, there was a",141
NA,"shortfall of approximately 3,000 university",141
NA,places that Griffith University required just,141
NA,to bring the Gold Coast up to the Australian,141
NA,average. When compared to other cities such,141
NA,"as Wollongong, that deficit rose to approxi-",141
NA,"mately 5,000 university places. I have been",141
NA,very pleased to be part of a government that,141
NA,has listened and responded to that cry and,141
NA,demand for new university places. Those,141
NA,"1,500 additional places will certainly go a",141
NA,"long way but, as I indicated, there is still",141
NA,"some significant work to do in that area, and",141
NA,I intend to continue working on that.,141
NA,I also highlight that my electors raised,141
NA,with me that they sought a new medical,141
NA,school for the Gold Coast. The Gold Coast,141
NA,for far too long was seen as the inferior,141
NA,cousin to Brisbane. Brisbane had a medical,141
NA,school and the Gold Coast had been attempt-,141
NA,ing to gain a medical school since the 1970s.,141
NA,I must particularly thank the former Minister,141
NA,"for Health and Ageing, Senator the Hon. Kay",141
NA,"reguPatterson, who together with Dr Brendan",141
NA,Nelson approved a new medical school for,141
NA,"the Gold Coast. Coincidentally, today the",141
NA,Australian Medical Council announced that,141
NA,both the Griffith University medical school,141
NA,and Bond University's medical school have,141
NA,received AMC approval. That is a great shot,141
NA,"in the arm for our region, and I am particu-",141
NA,larly excited to see two quite different mod-,141
NA,els of a medical school going forward and,141
NA,coming onto the marketplace in the near fu-,141
NA,ture.,141
NA,I am very excited to watch Griffith Uni-,141
NA,versity's medical school being constructed. It,141
NA,is a mere 500 metres up the road from my,141
NA,"electorate office, and I was pleased to see",141
NA,within the last several weeks the Griffith,141
NA,University medical school logo going up on,141
NA,the exterior of the building. It is a tremen-,141
NA,"dous shot in the arm for our city, and it",141
NA,means we have a long-term solution to the,141
NA,growing demand that exists within our city,141
NA,"for access to doctors. Importantly, it also",141
NA,satisfies the very strong demand among,141
NA,young people on the Gold Coast to undertake,141
NA,medical studies at a local campus.,141
NA,For the residents of Nerang and Highland,141
NA,"Park, access to Medicare services was an",141
NA,important priority as well. I sought a new,141
NA,"Medicare office for them and, although I was",141
NA,"unsuccessful, I was very pleased to announce",141
NA,in my last term the allocation of three new,141
NA,Medicare Easyclaim booths. The sites for,141
NA,"these have now been selected, and I am",141
NA,pleased that the tens of thousands of resi-,141
NA,dents west of the M1 motorway will now,141
NA,have a great deal of access to Medicare,142
NA,through these booths.,142
NA,Another key component which I spoke on,142
NA,at length in my maiden speech was the fact,142
NA,that the tourism industry is vitally important,142
NA,to the Gold Coast. The Howard government,142
NA,certainly has the runs on the board when it,142
NA,comes to the tourism industry. I was very,142
NA,pleased that the former Minister for Small,142
NA,"Business and Tourism, the Hon. Joe Hockey,",142
NA,was able to steer the tourism white paper,142
NA,through both this chamber and the other,142
NA,place. That white paper will see over $600,142
NA,million going into the tourism industry over,142
NA,the next four years. The proof that the tour-,142
NA,ism industry is already reaping significant,142
NA,benefits from this white paper can clearly be,142
NA,seen in the number of inbound tourists to,142
NA,Australia. I was pleased to see numbers re-,142
NA,leased by Tourism Australia which indicated,142
NA,that there had been more inbound interna-,142
NA,tional tourists coming to Australia in the,142
NA,12 months than for the year 2000 with the,142
NA,Sydney Olympics. This indicates a very,142
NA,strong resurgence and interest in visiting,142
NA,"Australia among international tourists, which",142
NA,generates significant export income.,142
NA,I was also pleased in my last term to see,142
NA,the Cooperative Research Centre for Sus-,142
NA,tainable Tourism-which is headquartered at,142
NA,Griffith University on the Gold Coast-,142
NA,receive nearly $30 million of funding from,142
NA,this government. It received this money be-,142
NA,cause it has been producing a number of very,142
NA,significant and commercially attractive ap-,142
NA,plications that the tourism industry has been,142
NA,embracing. We have seen significant runs on,142
NA,the board from this CRC which place it,142
NA,among the best CRCs currently operating in,142
NA,Australia. In the last 12 months I was also,142
NA,pleased that the new international centre of,142
NA,excellence for tourism was placed on the,142
NA,Gold Coast. These institutions not only en-,142
NA,sure growing recognition of the important,142
NA,role that the Gold Coast plays as the engine,142
NA,room for tourism in Australia but also create,142
NA,a link for those in the tourism industry to,142
NA,"additional applications, support and research,",142
NA,all of which help them to run their businesses,142
NA,better. At a time when our country is looking,142
NA,for additional opportunities to increase pro-,142
NA,"ductivity, it is important to recognise that",142
NA,productivity can also occur through effi-,142
NA,ciency gains realised in service industries,142
NA,like the tourism industry. I am very pleased,142
NA,that both the ICE and the CRC for Sustain-,142
NA,able Tourism play very important roles in,142
NA,this regard.,142
NA,During the campaign it was encouraging,142
NA,to have the Prime Minister visit. The Prime,142
NA,"Minister and I, whilst walking along the",142
NA,"beach towards Surfers Paradise one day, had",142
NA,the chance to talk about a number of key,142
NA,issues and challenges facing the city of the,142
NA,Gold Coast. Among them was the growing,142
NA,shortage of those who have been vocation-,142
NA,"past ally educated, and the announcement during",142
NA,the campaign of the new technical training,142
NA,colleges was a great shot in the arm. I was,142
NA,very pleased that the 24 sites selected in-,142
NA,cluded the Gold Coast. I believe that the,142
NA,Gold Coast benefits from having a strong,142
NA,"team of four Liberal members, and I have no",142
NA,doubt that the allocation of one of these new,142
NA,sites is a direct consequence of the Gold,142
NA,Coast having these four strong advocates.,142
NA,Last week I had the opportunity to partici-,142
NA,pate in the first roundtable in our region to,142
NA,discuss options for the new technical training,142
NA,college that will be placed on the Gold,142
NA,"Coast, and I was very excited by the discus-",142
NA,sion of and the enthusiasm for this new facil-,142
NA,ity. It means that across the board young,142
NA,people on the Gold Coast will have the op-,142
NA,portunity to participate not only in tertiary,142
NA,"education but in vocational education, which",142
NA,is equally as important. They will have ac-,142
NA,"cess to education in the correct skills for, for",142
NA,"example, the construction industry, the tour-",142
NA,ism industry and the marine industry-,142
NA,another nascent industry which presents,143
NA,great potential for the future. I would like,143
NA,see young people embrace the opportunity to,143
NA,undertake studies in the marine industry-,143
NA,whether it be in marine upholstery or fibre-,143
NA,glass-at the new technical training colleges,143
NA,that will be placed on the Gold Coast.,143
NA,I was also pleased that an extension of the,143
NA,film tax offset to the television industry was,143
NA,put forward as part of the federal govern-,143
NA,ment's policy. The film and TV industry on,143
NA,the Gold Coast is rapidly growing. Several,143
NA,hundred people are now directly employed,143
NA,not only in what are called ‘runaway produc-,143
NA,tions' from the United States but also in film,143
NA,and television productions indigenous to,143
NA,"Australia, with scripts that are written, pro-",143
NA,"duced, directed and post-produced in Austra-",143
NA,lia. The new film tax offset and its extension,143
NA,to the television industry will augment the,143
NA,number of incentives that already exist in,143
NA,this industry. I am very confident that this,143
NA,industry has its best days ahead of it and,143
NA,there will be opportunities for new graduates,143
NA,of vocational and tertiary education to under-,143
NA,take roles within this growing industry.,143
NA,My electorate has the highest number of,143
NA,small businesses per capita in this nation. We,143
NA,have seen a rededication by the Howard gov-,143
NA,ernment and certainly by me to ensuring that,143
NA,conditions within this country benefit small,143
NA,"businesses, which truly are the engine room",143
NA,of our nation. If we did not have entrepre-,143
NA,neurs willing to take risks in seeking reward,143
NA,then we as a nation would not be able to,143
NA,meet many of the challenges that face us. We,143
NA,have heard a number of those challenges,143
NA,"enunciated today, not least of which is our",143
NA,ageing population. I believe fundamentally,143
NA,that the reforms that we are making in the,143
NA,small business sector-I note in particular,143
NA,"the unfair dismissal laws which, under the",143
NA,"new composition of the Senate, will finally",143
NA,have a chance to be passed-will remove,143
NA,many of the shackles that the Labor Party,143
NA,"left on the small business sector, enabling it",143
NA,to to be more productive and profitable and to,143
NA,employ more people into the future.,143
NA,I have listed each of these points because I,143
NA,believe that they not only relate to the needs,143
NA,and aspirations of middle Australia but also,143
NA,highlight and demonstrate the way in which,143
NA,the Howard government has delivered very,143
NA,strongly for the people of the Gold Coast.,143
NA,"With a population of nearly 500,000, the",143
NA,Gold Coast does continue to face a number,143
NA,of significant challenges. The various points,143
NA,I have raised are some of the challenges but,143
NA,"are also, importantly, some of the solutions",143
NA,that this government has highlighted. How-,143
NA,"ever, these are not final solutions. There still",143
NA,"needs to be more work done, and I will con-",143
NA,tinue to undertake that work. Principal,143
NA,among that work is to address the growing,143
NA,need for additional funding into traffic and,143
NA,transport infrastructure.,143
NA,I cannot go further on this point without,143
NA,recognising the $12 billion investment that,143
NA,the Howard government is making under the,143
NA,AusLink proposal and also expressing my,143
NA,extreme concern and disappointment in the,143
NA,Queensland state Labor government. The,143
NA,Queensland state Labor government this year,143
NA,ran a budget surplus of $2.3 billion. Despite,143
NA,this budget surplus and despite nearly $1,143
NA,billion in road funding that was put toward,143
NA,"the M1 project, or the Pacific Motorway, that",143
NA,"runs over the Tweed border, I was disap-",143
NA,"pointed to see the state Premier, Peter",143
NA,"Beattie, announce recently that they would",143
NA,not proceed with additional widening of the,143
NA,M1 between Nerang and the Tweed border,143
NA,unless the federal government was willing to,143
NA,put even more money into the project. I,143
NA,really question the bona fides of the Queen-,143
NA,sland state government when they run a $2.3,143
NA,"billion budget surplus and, most importantly,",143
NA,have a $500 million windfall gain as a con-,143
NA,sequence of the introduction of the goods,143
NA,and services tax by this government and yet,143
NA,still cry poor when it comes to important,144
NA,transport infrastructure such as the M1 pro-,144
NA,ject. I implore the state Labor members on,144
NA,the Gold Coast to please speak with the Pre-,144
NA,mier and ensure that this very necessary and,144
NA,important road project is completed.,144
NA,I again thank my campaign team for their,144
NA,efforts in the last election. I also thank those,144
NA,opponents who stood because of their belief,144
NA,in having a robust democracy. I am very,144
NA,grateful to the constituents of Moncrieff;,144
NA,with their good grace I would like to con-,144
NA,tinue serving them throughout the entirety of,144
NA,this next term.,144
Ms LIVERMORE ,Capricornia) (8.33,144
NA,p.m.)-I would like to take this opportunity,144
NA,to thank the people of Capricornia for seeing,144
NA,fit to re-elect me as their federal member. I,144
NA,sincerely appreciate the confidence that my,144
NA,constituents have shown in me by allowing,144
NA,me to continue to serve them. I would also,144
NA,like to take this opportunity to guarantee that,144
NA,the confidence the voters of Capricornia,144
NA,have placed in me will not be taken for,144
NA,granted. I will continue to work hard for,144
NA,them and to bring their issues into this,144
NA,chamber.,144
NA,Tonight's speech feels a little bit like a de,144
NA,"facto first speech because, as of 9 October,",144
NA,my electorate of Capricornia changed dra-,144
NA,matically from that to which I was first,144
NA,"elected in 1998. When I was first elected,",144
NA,Capricornia extended from the beautiful,144
NA,Capricorn coast to the outback town of Win-,144
NA,"ton, the home of Waltzing Matilda, and be-",144
NA,yond. The redistribution has almost halved,144
NA,the geographic size of my electorate and has,144
NA,removed much of the outback which I was so,144
NA,proud to serve. Today's Capricornia now,144
NA,extends west only to the town of Clermont,144
NA,"and takes in areas to the south-west, includ-",144
NA,"ing Mount Morgan, Duaringa, Woorabinda",144
NA,and Banana shires. The redistribution of my,144
NA,electorate leaves me with mixed feelings:,144
NA,sadness at the loss of so many beautiful,144
NA,places and wonderful people in towns like,144
NA,"Winton, Longreach, Aramac, Barcaldine,",144
NA,"Jericho and Alpha, and renewed motivation",144
NA,as I get to discover and make connections,144
NA,with the newly acquired areas.,144
NA,Over the past six years it has been a,144
NA,pleasure to make my regular trips to Lon-,144
NA,greach and the other communities of the cen-,144
NA,tral west that are no longer part of my elec-,144
NA,"torate and talk to the residents, face to face,",144
NA,about their issues and their lives. Throughout,144
NA,"this time, these people have been struggling",144
NA,through the worst drought they have ever,144
NA,"seen, yet they remain determined and com-",144
NA,mitted to life in the bush. I am going to miss,144
NA,"these areas on a personal level as well, as",144
NA,they hold a special place in my heart. It was,144
NA,in Barcaldine where I was married to my,144
NA,"partner, Craig, and it often feels like a second",144
NA,home to us. These areas also hold great his-,144
NA,torical and cultural value for Australia-,144
NA,whether they be the birthplace of Qantas or,144
NA,the Australian Labor Party or the site of the,144
NA,penning of Waltzing Matilda. It can easily be,144
NA,seen how much I love these places and why I,144
NA,"am saddened to be losing them. In particular,",144
NA,I am saddened by the loss of my Longreach,144
NA,electorate office and my staff member in that,144
NA,"office, Kelly Wood. In order to better repre-",144
NA,"sent the people of the far central west, I",144
NA,opened the first federal member's office in,144
NA,Longreach. I know this was greatly appreci-,144
NA,"ated by everyone in the central west, and I",144
NA,trust that The Nationals' new member for the,144
NA,area will maintain the office I opened and,144
NA,continue to provide that level of service to,144
NA,the people around Longreach and the central,144
NA,west.,144
NA,"Of course, there is another, more positive,",144
NA,side to the redistribution. I am happy to have,144
NA,picked up some new areas that are all inter-,144
NA,"esting, dynamic places filled with people",144
NA,with initiative and a commitment to building,144
NA,on the strengths of our region. I would like to,144
NA,take this opportunity to welcome the new,145
NA,"areas to Capricornia: the shires of Duaringa,",145

NA,"Mount Morgan is a grand old town, with a",145

NA,heyday it was the richest goldmine in Austra-,145

NA,for people from all over Australia who want,145
NA,to catch a glimpse of the past and enjoy the,145
NA,friendly small-town hospitality for which,145
NA,Mount Morgan is renowned. Banana Shire,145
NA,also moves to Capricornia from the elector-,145

NA,more. Banana Shire contains some of the,145
NA,largest commodity production areas in Cen-,145
NA,"tral Queensland, contributing some $123",145

NA,Woorabinda is an Indigenous community,145
NA,"of around 1,600 people located about 170",145
NA,kilometres south-west of Rockhampton. The,145
NA,people of Woorabinda have strong family,145
NA,and community ties to Rockhampton. I have,145
NA,helped many of its residents on an individual,145
NA,Each basis in the past; I now look forward to,145
NA,working with the community as a whole to,145
NA,achieve its collective goals. Capricornia has,145
NA,"an interesting past and a bright future, which",145
NA,"makes it a great place to live, work and",145
NA,watch your family grow. When I talk to local,145
NA,"leaders, businesspeople and those involved",145
NA,of in the organisations that are the lifeblood of,145
NA,"our Central Queensland communities, I hear",145
NA,that there is no shortage of challenges that,145
NA,we have to overcome but also that there are,145
NA,plenty of opportunities to work towards.,145
NA,What we really need in Central Queen-,145
NA,"sland, and what I have been calling for ever",145
NA,"since I got to this place, is a genuine partner-",145
NA,ship between our region and the federal gov-,145
NA,ernment. We need a federal government that,145
NA,is truly committed to understanding and,145
NA,working with our region to achieve our full,145
NA,"potential. Among other things, that means",145
NA,"providing important infrastructure, like the",145
NA,roads to Shoalwater Bay. It means assisting,145
NA,Central Queensland University to build on its,145
NA,capacity to provide top-class educational,145
NA,opportunities to our local students. It also,145
NA,means improving access to essential ser-,145
NA,"vices, such as health services. Instead, this",145
NA,government has continually implemented,145
NA,policies that work against Central Queen-,145
NA,"sland and, indeed, against rural and regional",145
NA,Australia more generally.,145
NA,One example of this is the government's,145
NA,policy on the pricing for rescue and fire-,145
NA,fighting services at airports. Under the new,145
NA,pricing structure released by Airservices,145
NA,"Australia earlier this year, airlines wanting to",145
NA,"run services to Rockhampton Airport, which",145
NA,is already the second most expensive airport,145
NA,"to land at in Australia, will cop a doubling of",145
NA,landing fees over the next five years. The fee,146
NA,to land an aircraft at Rockhampton Airport,146
NA,"will increase to almost $20 per landed tonne,",146
NA,while the same aircraft landing in Sydney or,146
NA,Melbourne will cost less than $2 per landed,146
NA,"tonne. Apparently, the Minister for Transport",146
NA,and Regional Services and Leader of The,146
NA,Nationals thinks it is good policy for the,146
NA,"people of Central Queensland, every time",146
NA,they catch a flight from Rockhampton Air-,146
NA,"port, to subsidise travellers from Sydney and",146
NA,Melbourne.,146
NA,The government might think that the elec-,146
NA,tion result is a resounding endorsement of,146
NA,"their policies, but I can assure them that there",146
NA,are many areas in which the Howard gov-,146
NA,ernment continues to fail to respond to the,146
NA,needs and aspirations of the people of rural,146
NA,and regional areas like Central Queensland.,146
NA,"For example, the people of Capricornia cer-",146
NA,tainly did not vote for the Howard govern-,146
NA,"ment agenda on Telstra. Interestingly, the",146
NA,coalition candidates in Capricornia did not,146
NA,seem to like the Howard government's,146
NA,agenda on Telstra either. They certainly did,146
NA,not spend any time talking about it in the,146
NA,"campaign. Instead, they spent the campaign",146
NA,pretending that it was not in fact government,146
NA,policy to sell the remaining publicly-owned,146
NA,share of Telstra. And for good reason-quite,146
NA,"simply, the people of Central Queensland do",146
NA,not want Telstra privatised and they have,146
NA,voted that way in the last three elections.,146
NA,"They understand, even if this government",146
NA,"does not, that a privatised Telstra will mean a",146
NA,reduction in services and jobs in our part of,146
NA,the country.,146
NA,"I was advised that on Friday, 12 Novem-",146
NA,ber the small community of Mount,146
NA,"Chalmers, some 40 kilometres from Rock-",146
NA,"hampton, lost its telephone service. When",146
NA,"advised of this problem, Telstra's response",146
NA,"was that they were aware of the problem, as",146
NA,more than 100 telephone services in the area,146
NA,"were out of commission. However, as no-one",146
NA,in the area had a ‘diagnosed life threatening,146
NA,illness' everything was okay because ser-,146
NA,vices were expected to be resumed by 6.00,146
NA,p.m. on Wednesday the 17th. So Telstra be-,146
NA,lieves the residents of this small community,146
NA,can do without telephone services for five,146
NA,days. You have to ask yourself what the re-,146
NA,sponse would be if people living on the,146
NA,North Shore of Sydney were told the same,146
NA,thing by Telstra. You might well say that if,146
NA,there is a real emergency the residents can,146
NA,use their mobile phones. But there is no mo-,146
NA,bile phone service at Mount Chalmers. Ap-,146
NA,"parently, this is what the Howard govern-",146
NA,ment considers ‘up to scratch' when it comes,146
NA,to regional phone services.,146
NA,I would have thought that The Nationals,146
NA,members in the Howard government would,146
NA,"understand that this is taipan country, that",146
NA,"farm accidents do occur, that children do fall",146
NA,"out of trees and into dams, that illness can",146
NA,strike at any moment and that the most im-,146
NA,portant item in a rural home at the time of an,146
NA,emergency is a working telephone. We are,146
NA,taught at school how Flynn and the pedal,146
NA,radio made it much safer for people to live in,146
NA,rural Australia because his pedal radio pro-,146
NA,vided instant communication in the event of,146
NA,"an emergency. Well, here we are in 2004",146
NA,with the Howard government hell-bent on,146
NA,the full privatisation of Telstra without ensur-,146
NA,ing that services in regional and rural Austra-,146
NA,lia are at an acceptable level. You would,146
NA,have to say that the people of Mount,146
NA,Chalmers would have been safer 75 years,146
NA,ago with a pedal radio than with the non-,146
NA,existent Telstra service of last week. I appeal,146
NA,to our Nationals colleagues in this place to,146
NA,do what your constituents in rural Australia,146
NA,are asking of you. Stop the sale of Telstra.,146
NA,Stop withdrawing services from rural and,146
NA,regional areas and start standing up for the,146
NA,regions you purport to represent in this place.,146
NA,To even suggest that Telstra services in,146
NA,regional and rural Australia are up to city,146
NA,standards is an arrogant disregard for the,147
NA,"truth. The Nationals must listen, as I have",147
NA,"done, to the people in my electorate and they",147
NA,must stop the further sale of Telstra. As I was,147
NA,"talking about the Flying Doctor, it is appro-",147
NA,priate that I mention the chronic shortage of,147
NA,doctors in rural and regional Australia. I am,147
NA,sure that those members of The Nationals,147
NA,who are listening to their electorate will,147
NA,know that what I am saying is not just rheto-,147
NA,ric. They know that every small town and,147
NA,regional centre is crying out for more medi-,147
NA,cal staff. I have a constant stream of people,147
NA,coming into my office who feel that their,147
NA,lives are at risk because they are on waiting,147
NA,lists due to the shortage of medical profes-,147
NA,sionals in our regional and rural centres.,147
NA,"Just last Sunday night, a constituent of",147
NA,mine fell and badly hurt her leg. As is the,147
NA,"way with so many country people, she did",147
NA,not ring for an ambulance because she did,147
NA,not want to occupy them when they might be,147
NA,needed for something more serious. So she,147
NA,made her own way to the local base hospital.,147
NA,She arrived at 11.00 p.m. and left at 3.00,147
NA,a.m. the following day. Her four-hour ex-,147
NA,perience at the accident and emergency ward,147
NA,has had a profound effect on her. With only,147
NA,"one doctor on duty, this woman tells me that",147
NA,"two people died, a baby was born in the car",147
NA,park-which I can attest to because it was on,147
NA,the front page of the local paper-and a,147
NA,number of other patients were treated for a,147
NA,variety of other injuries. This is clearly not,147
NA,an unusual night in a regional or rural hospi-,147
NA,tal.,147
NA,For too long the Howard government has,147
NA,simply ignored the medical needs of our ru-,147
NA,ral people. I guess they hope that foreign,147
NA,doctors will plug the gaps and the people of,147
NA,regional and rural Australia will just accept,147
NA,second-class health system or one that sees,147
NA,them flying off to Brisbane for everything,147
NA,they need. Those gaps are now gaping holes,147
NA,"and, whereas there was a time once when",147
NA,only young people left the country to find,147
NA,"work in our cities, we are now seeing older",147
NA,Australians leaving regional and rural centres,147
NA,to live in our capital cities because they un-,147
NA,derstand that the health services provided in,147
NA,our cities are far superior to what is available,147
NA,to them in the bush. In many cases these,147
NA,people leave behind homes and families and,147
NA,communities where they have spent most of,147
NA,their lives and move to capital cities where,147
NA,they have no social contact and become an,147
NA,increasing burden on the already over-,147
NA,stretched public system. I fear this trend will,147
NA,continue and even increase as the Howard,147
NA,government continues to ignore the health,147
NA,requirements of our ageing citizens living in,147
NA,our regional areas.,147
NA,It surprises me that we do not hear more,147
NA,from The Nationals opposite about this. They,147
NA,claim to represent that 36 per cent of the,147
NA,"population which lives in rural Australia, so",147
NA,they must know the statistics-that the 36,147
NA,per cent of Australians who live in rural Aus-,147
NA,tralia die younger and at a higher rate in,147
NA,every age bracket than Australians in our,147
NA,cities. This situation is not helped by the,147
NA,shortage of medical services in rural Austra-,147
NA,lia. The truth is that this government has al-,147
NA,lowed rural medical services to run down to,147
NA,such an extent that they have now reached a,147
NA,critical level. I understand that the issues are,147
NA,"complex, but surely the government is capa-",147
NA,ble of taking one step at a time.,147
NA,My challenge to the government is to take,147
NA,just that first step by way of ensuring that the,147
NA,doctors who work and live in rural Australia,147
NA,are appropriately recognised. At the moment,147
NA,"rural and remote practice is not recognised,",147
NA,and I am saying that it should be badged as a,147
NA,specialist area. I believe this one simple step,147
NA,a would get more doctors into rural practice.,147
NA,"At the moment it is difficult, and, indeed,",147
NA,"some think risky, for young doctors to get the",147
NA,skills they need to feel confident about work-,147
NA,ing in the bush. Existing programs are frag-,147
NA,mented and obviously not working. Rural,148
NA,"doctors need to feel valued, not only by their",148
NA,community but also by their colleagues in,148
NA,the medical profession and by the wider,148
NA,community. I think it is time that the gov-,148
NA,ernment seriously considers having those,148
NA,doctors working in the bush recognised as,148
NA,rural and remote practice specialists.,148
NA,"On the topic of health services, I would",148
NA,like to mention a commitment that was made,148
NA,by the Labor Party to the people of Central,148
NA,Queensland during the election campaign,148
NA,and urge the government to follow suit now,148
NA,that they are the ones responsible for the,148
NA,health of my constituents. I am referring to,148
NA,Labor's pledge to fund a Medicare eligible,148
NA,MRI machine at the Rockhampton Base,148
NA,Hospital. This announcement was widely,148
NA,welcomed and the service is still much,148
NA,needed by the Central Queensland commu-,148
NA,nity. The government is in receipt of two,148
NA,applications from my region-one from,148
NA,Queensland Health seeking to install a Medi-,148
NA,care eligible machine at the Rockhampton,148
NA,Base Hospital and one from a private opera-,148
NA,"tor, Central Queensland Medical Imaging.",148
NA,Labor's policy is that MRI services should,148
NA,"be available through our public hospitals,",148
NA,"and that, of course, remains my preference.",148
NA,"However, the bottom line is that we need this",148
NA,"service in Central Queensland, so the private",148
NA,applicant has my support for the submission,148
NA,it made to the government if that is the only,148
NA,way we are going to see an improvement in,148
NA,people's access to this important health ser-,148
NA,vice in my region. The submissions have,148
NA,been with the government for some months,148
NA,"now, so the government should get on and",148
NA,make its decision about the placement of the,148
NA,20 additional MRI services that the minister,148
NA,announced back in June. Rockhampton has,148
NA,been identified by both the Commonwealth,148
NA,and the Queensland governments as a high,148
NA,"priority regional centre, so the need for the",148
NA,service has already been clearly established.,148
NA,I am calling on the government to just get on,148
NA,"with it and make its decision, and I believe",148
NA,that they should announce Rockhampton as,148
NA,one of the recipients of those Medicare eligi-,148
NA,ble MRI machines.,148
NA,"In closing, we have heard quite a lot of",148
NA,comment in the last couple of weeks stem-,148
NA,ming from the allegations that were made by,148
NA,the member for New England about just who,148
NA,this government seem to think they are work-,148
NA,ing for in this country. I would like to let the,148
NA,government know that I am here working for,148
NA,the people of Capricornia and I expect as a,148
NA,Labor member that the government will take,148
NA,the needs of my constituents just as seriously,148
NA,as those of members sitting on the other side,148
NA,of the chamber.,148
Dr SOUTHCOTT ,Boothby) (8.49,148
NA,"p.m.)-May I congratulate you, Mr Deputy",148
NA,"Speaker Jenkins, on your re-election to your",148
NA,"position and also, through you, the Speaker",148
NA,on his election. I have served with the,148
NA,Speaker on the House of Representatives,148
NA,Standing Committee on Economics since,148
NA,1996 and he does have a reputation for being,148
NA,fair and decent and for trying to achieve con-,148
NA,sensus where possible. I would also like to,148
NA,take the opportunity to pay tribute to several,148
NA,members of the 40th parliament who were,148
NA,not re-elected at the 2004 election: Ross,148
NA,"Cameron, Larry Anthony and Trish Worth.",148
NA,Ross was the member for Parramatta. He,148
NA,was the Parliamentary Secretary to the,148
NA,Treasurer at the time of the last election. I,148
NA,think I met Ross in 1996 when we first came,148
NA,in. He was a terrific orator. He made a big,148
NA,"contribution in parliament, not least through",148
NA,his convening of the National Student Lead-,148
NA,"ership Forum on Faith and Values, which",148
NA,was a bipartisan affair at which both the,148
NA,Prime Minister and the Leader of the Oppo-,148
NA,"sition used to speak, as well as a number of",148
NA,"members of parliament, the Governor-",148
NA,General and so on.,148
NA,Larry Anthony was also a member of the,149
NA,class of 1996. He did a great job in his ministhe,149
NA,terial portfolio. I thank him for finding some,149
NA,funding for a literary festival which we held,149
NA,in Boothby in November. He was a very tal-,149
NA,ented minister and did a great job of repre-,149
NA,senting the electorate of Richmond in this,149
NA,"place. One of my neighbours, the member",149
NA,"for Adelaide, Trish Worth, held what is a",149
NA,very difficult seat for the Liberal Party in,149
NA,four elections. At three out of four of those,149
NA,elections she had to wait 10 days until find-,149
NA,"ing out whether she had been elected, but",149
NA,Trish also did a great job as Parliamentary,149
NA,Secretary to the Minister for Health and Age-,149
NA,ing and Parliamentary Secretary to the Min-,149
NA,"ister for Education, Training and Youth Af-",149
NA,fairs.,149
NA,Both Ross and Larry have politics in the,149
NA,"blood, as you do, Mr Deputy Speaker Jen-",149
NA,"kins, and I sincerely hope that their talents",149
NA,"will not be lost to politics. Similarly, with",149
NA,"Trish, I hope that she will be able to do",149
NA,something in the areas which she is so pas-,149
NA,"sionate about: breast cancer, mental health",149
NA,and so on.,149
NA,I am particularly proud to have been,149
NA,"re-elected, for the fourth time now, to repre-",149
NA,sent the electorate of Boothby. Members who,149
NA,have previously held the seat of Boothby,149
NA,"include Sir John MCLeay, who was the long-",149
NA,est serving Speaker of the House of Repre-,149
NA,"sentatives; John MCLeay, who was a minister",149
NA,in the Fraser government; and former Pre-,149
NA,"mier Steele Hall. Interestingly, I found a",149
NA,book in a bookstore about another one of my,149
NA,"predecessors, Archibald Grenfell Price, who",149
NA,held the seat from 1941 to 1943. The last,149
NA,time we lost the seat of Boothby to the Labor,149
NA,Party was in 1943; it was a disastrous elec-,149
NA,tion for us. Archibald Grenfell Price had a,149
NA,big involvement with St Mark's College at,149
NA,the University of Adelaide and so on.,149
NA,Boothby was redistributed dramatically in,149
NA,early 1990s so that the seat is quite dif-,149
NA,ferent from what it was historically. Much of,149
NA,the western part of Boothby was the seat of,149
NA,"Hawker, which was held for a long time by",149
NA,Ralph Jacobi. Along the coast much of it was,149
NA,"Kingston, which was held variously by",149
NA,"Gordon Bilney, Grant Chapman before him,",149
NA,and Richie Gun for the Labor Party during,149
NA,the 1970s. Having campaigned with Grant,149
NA,"Chapman, it is encouraging to see that some",149
NA,of the people still recognised him and re-,149
NA,membered him from his time as the member,149
NA,for Kingston. It has been a real honour to be,149
NA,re-elected. Boothby is the seat where I went,149
NA,to school and where I worked prior to be-,149
NA,coming a member of parliament. It is a great,149
NA,"area, the southern suburbs of Adelaide, and it",149
NA,is a real pleasure to represent it.,149
NA,"In reflecting on the election result, one of",149
NA,the key things was the collapse in the De-,149
NA,mocrat vote. The Democrats made a serious,149
NA,charge in Boothby in 2001. Their vote in,149
NA,"Boothby was always about 13 per cent, but",149
NA,in 2001 they actually received almost 20 per,149
NA,cent. In 2004 that fell to two per cent and,149
NA,most of that went to the Labor Party. In re-,149
NA,"flecting on the result, a group of people who",149
NA,previously voted for the Democrats have,149
NA,"now, by and large, gone across to the Labor",149
NA,"Party. As the member for Boothby, I have",149
NA,noted that. They are voters who were con-,149
NA,cerned with things other than the manage-,149
NA,"ment of the economy, and I am aware of the",149
NA,issues they are interested in.,149
NA,"Looking at the result nationally, I am par-",149
NA,"ticularly proud to be part of the team, led by",149
NA,"the Prime Minister John Howard, which has",149
NA,been able to win such strong support not,149
NA,only in the outer suburban areas of Australia,149
NA,but also in rural and regional areas. If we,149
NA,"reflect on this, this pattern was actually evi-",149
NA,dent at the time of the 1999 republican refer-,149
NA,endum; you could almost see a correlation,149
NA,between the yes vote and the distance from,149
NA,the GPO. Now we have seen this reflected in,150
NA,the 2004 election whereby a seat like Ade-,150
NA,"laide, an inner city seat, fell to Labor. But, of",150
NA,"course, Labor has lost seats like Kingston",150
NA,"and Wakefield in my own state, Bonner in",150
NA,"Queensland, Hasluck and Stirling in Western",150
NA,Australia and so on.,150
NA,I am also particularly proud that the Lib-,150
NA,eral Party is now the choice of skilled,150
NA,"tradespeople, apprentices and blue-collar",150
NA,"workers. Looking at the 2004 election, we",150
NA,can reflect on the difference between the,150
NA,sorts of people that the Liberal Party elects to,150
NA,parliament and those that the Labor Party,150
NA,elects to parliament. The Liberal Party crop,150
NA,"of 2004 includes an ophthalmologist, a test",150
NA,"pilot for the Air Force, a policeman who",150
NA,worked in counter-terrorism and a policeman,150
NA,who worked in the Star Force in my own,150
NA,state. These people represent the range of,150
NA,occupations right across Australia.,150
NA,"Looking at the Labor Party's personnel,",150
NA,we can see that they are by and large people,150
NA,who have worked as either political staffers,150
NA,or trade union officials. Some people think,150
NA,this is a new phenomenon; I do not believe it,150
NA,"is. If you look back to the 1949 election, you",150
NA,will see that pretty much the same sort of,150
NA,people were being elected to represent the,150
NA,"Labor Party. In the 1949 election, the great",150
NA,crop for the Liberal Party were by and large,150
NA,"ex-servicemen, many of whom were officers,",150
NA,who really did a much better job of repre-,150
NA,senting the community. Where the change,150
NA,has occurred has been observed by Barry,150
NA,"Cohen. In 1949, going back to when the Lib-",150
NA,"eral Party was first formed, the Labor Party",150
NA,still elected blue-collar workers to the na-,150
NA,tional parliament. Right now very few people,150
NA,in the Labor parliamentary caucus have ever,150
NA,been blue-collar workers; they are mostly,150
NA,"apparatchiks, careerists and so on. Until the",150
NA,Labor Party addresses this problem with,150
NA,"their parliamentary personnel, it will con-",150
NA,tinue to struggle to find relevance with the,150
NA,wider community.,150
NA,The central question of the 2004 election,150
NA,was: who do you trust to manage Australia's,150
NA,$800 billion economy? I think now at quiz,150
NA,nights or wherever people always know what,150
NA,the exact size of our GDP is. But the impor-,150
NA,tant thing is that almost everyone agrees that,150
NA,"the economy is running well: inflation is low,",150
NA,unemployment is low and GDP growth is,150
NA,strong. But this has not occurred by accident;,150
NA,it only comes with discipline and by focusing,150
NA,relentlessly on every single question. The,150
NA,question of forestry versus timber workers,150
NA,really highlighted to me the fact that the La-,150
NA,bor Party is not equipped to manage the,150
NA,strong and diverse national economy we,150
NA,have in Australia. Unemployment is at 5.3,150
NA,per cent; it is the lowest it has been since,150
NA,"1977. There is, of course, more to do. We",150
NA,had two recessions-one in the early eighties,150
NA,and another in the early nineties-and a lot,150
NA,of blue-collar workers lost their jobs. We,150
NA,now have the Minister for Workforce Par-,150
NA,"ticipation, who will be trying to get more",150
NA,people from these backgrounds back into,150
NA,work.,150
NA,ADJOURNMENT,150
The SPEAKER,Order! It being 9.00,150
NA,"p.m., I propose the question:",150
NA,That the House do now adjourn.,150
NA,Aviation: Second Sydney Airport,150
Mr MURPHY ,Lowe) (9.00 p.m.)-,150
NA,Tonight I again raise the issue of aircraft,150
NA,"noise and Sydney airport. Mr Speaker, you",150
NA,will doubtlessly recall that in the last two,150
NA,parliaments I raised this issue on countless,150
NA,occasions in speeches and questions on be-,150
NA,half of the constituents I represent in my,150
NA,electorate of Lowe. As I found out during the,150
NA,"recent election campaign, the Liberal Party",150
NA,in my electorate still believe it is acceptable,150
NA,"to break promises, betray the people of the",150
NA,inner west and pretend this issue has gone,150
NA,away. Not a chance. I will continue to fight,151
NA,for my constituents who are unfairly affected,151
NA,by aircraft noise from Sydney airport.,151
NA,"As I have noted on many occasions, the",151
NA,ministerial direction that brought the Sydney,151
NA,airport long-term operating plan into being,151
NA,back in 1997 stipulates an aircraft movement,151
NA,target to the north of Sydney airport of 17,151
NA,per cent. It is an appalling indictment on the,151
NA,Howard government that since the introduc-,151
NA,tion of the LTOP not once in seven years has,151
NA,Airservices Australia achieved the target of,151
NA,17 per cent of all aircraft movements prom-,151
NA,ised to the people living to the north of the,151
NA,"airport. On the contrary, residents of the",151
NA,ner west living to the north of Sydney airport,151
NA,have suffered percentages of aircraft traffic,151
NA,movement far in excess of the 17 per cent,151
NA,"target. Indeed, the minister's briefing notes",151
NA,"on Sydney airport, which provide official",151
NA,data on air traffic movements for Sydney,151
NA,"airport, show that aircraft movements to the",151
NA,north of Sydney airport have averaged,151
NA,around 27 per cent of all air traffic move-,151
NA,ments in a single review period. This means,151
NA,there are nearly 60 per cent more movements,151
NA,to the north of Sydney airport than the resi-,151
NA,dents legitimately expect from the published,151
NA,"LTOP targets. In fact, in certain review peri-",151
NA,ods air traffic movements to the north have,151
NA,risen as high as 33 per cent-or nearly 100,151
NA,per cent higher than the target. This situation,151
NA,is intolerable.,151
NA,"Cynically, the Minister for Transport and",151
NA,Regional Services has repeatedly responded,151
NA,to my questions by saying that the LTOP has,151
NA,been ‘substantially implemented'. That is an,151
NA,insult to my constituents. Aircraft noise for,151
NA,my electorate in Sydney's inner west remains,151
NA,one of the major environmental issues con-,151
NA,fronting Sydney. It is a chronic environ-,151
NA,mental problem aggravated by the greedy,151
NA,sale of Sydney airport by the government,151
NA,before the aircraft noise problems had been,151
NA,solved. Following the sale of Sydney airport,151
NA,to the Southern Cross consortium for an ab-,151
NA,"surd $5.6 billion on 28 June 2002, my elec-",151
NA,"torate can expect an ever increasing, massive",151
NA,"increase of aircraft noise and, with it, air traf-",151
NA,"fic. More disturbingly, the higher volumes of",151
NA,traffic mean more pressure to revert to paral-,151
NA,lel runway operations.,151
NA,All this is noted in an environment where,151
NA,the government systematically misled the,151
NA,public with the false expectation that the,151
NA,statutory provisions of the Airports Act,151
NA,"1996-in particular, sections 18 through 22",151
NA,"inclusive, as they then were-would ensure",151
NA,that Sydney West airport would be con-,151
NA,in- structed and made operational as part of the,151
NA,strategic solution to Sydney airport's aircraft,151
NA,"noise problem. Instead, the Prime Minister",151
NA,abandoned Badgerys Creek and gave the,151
NA,winning bid to Southern Cross consortium,151
NA,and Macquarie Bank-not to mention the,151
NA,"PM's former chief of staff, Mr Max Moore-",151
NA,"Wilton, who I note is now both the chief ex-",151
NA,ecutive officer and the general manager of,151
NA,Sydney Airport Corporation Ltd. In this foul,151
NA,"sequence of events, the worst case nightmare",151
NA,has unfolded for the people I represent. Syd-,151
NA,"ney airport was sold alone, devoid of any",151
NA,legal requirement on the winning privatised,151
NA,entity to build Sydney West airport. As a re-,151
NA,"sult, the government has condemned the",151
NA,residents of Sydney to a single airport servic-,151
NA,ing a population nearing five million.,151
NA,"Finally, I note that, following the making",151
NA,of the master plan for Sydney airport which,151
NA,projects huge increases in air traffic move-,151
NA,"ments, the SACL exhibited the draft major",151
NA,development plan for Sydney airport's car,151
NA,parking and commercial facilities of the in-,151
NA,"ternal terminal precinct in July 2004 and,",151
NA,"within a short space of time, the Sydney air-",151
NA,port environment strategy. With that draft,151
NA,development plan came a non-renewal of,151
NA,pricing surveillance for parking facilities at,151
NA,Sydney airport. At each and every opportu-,151
NA,nity the coalition government has adopted an,151
NA,"anarchic, laissez-faire approach: a system of",152
NA,no government is good government. The,152
NA,coalition has given the owners of Sydney,152
NA,airport carte blanche to make as much money,152
NA,as they like with all but no government inter-,152
NA,ference. It is truly repugnant-truly a total,152
NA,abnegation of environmental and governance,152
NA,responsibility. Tonight I again put the gov-,152
NA,ernment on notice that I will continue to re-,152
NA,lentlessly pursue it in this House and through,152
NA,the Sydney Airport Community Forum. That,152
NA,is the least my constituents in Lowe deserve.,152
NA,(Time expired),152
NA,Roads: Roe Highway,152
Dr JENSEN ,Tangney) (9.05 p.m.)-I re-,152
NA,fer to comments made by the member for,152
NA,Fremantle as published in the Melville City,152
NA,"Herald on Saturday, 27 November. I particu-",152
NA,larly refer to the comments made by the,152
NA,member that Melville City Council's deci-,152
NA,"sion to spend $300,000 on an advertising",152
NA,campaign to criticise the state Labor gov-,152
NA,ernment for not fulfilling its end of the bar-,152
NA,gain in regard to building stage 8 of the Roe,152
NA,Highway and therefore linking the highway,152
NA,"to the port of Fremantle, Western Australia's",152
NA,"main commercial port, is a waste of taxpay-",152
NA,ers' money. I also refer to the member's,152
NA,comments that she has received only one,152
NA,email on the topic of the Roe Highway ex-,152
NA,tension and the Fremantle Eastern Bypass,152
NA,"and, unsurprisingly, it was in support of state",152
NA,Labor's position. If the member wishes to,152
NA,criticise anyone for wasting taxpayers',152
NA,"money, she should point her finger at her",152
NA,state colleagues: Premier Gallop and the,152
NA,"minister for transport, Alannah MACTiernan.",152
NA,I remind the member for Fremantle of an,152
NA,election promise from her state Labor col-,152
NA,leagues to build the Roe Highway to stage 8.,152
NA,This would extend the Kwinana Freeway in,152
NA,Leeming to the end of the proposed Freman-,152
NA,tle Eastern Bypass in Beaconsfield. It would,152
NA,provide a safe and efficient regional road,152
NA,link between the western suburbs of Perth,152
NA,"and destinations to the east. Primarily, it",152
NA,would ensure there was a designated heavy,152
NA,haulage route for the container loaded road,152
NA,trains travelling to Fremantle Port. Such,152
NA,commercial traffic would enjoy greater pro-,152
NA,ductivity as there would be no lights along,152
NA,"the proposed highway, unlike the 27 sets of",152
NA,lights road trains are forced to negotiate,152
NA,while passing along their current route of,152
NA,Leach Highway. Leach Highway passes,152
NA,"through the middle of many residences,",152
NA,"schools, the largest netball centre in the",152
NA,"southern suburbs, a public golf course and",152
NA,many other community amenities whose pa-,152
NA,trons all have to suffer the constant flow of,152
NA,heavy haulage commercial traffic.,152
NA,I have received insurmountable support,152
NA,from constituents and community groups,152
NA,"who are concerned for their children, for",152
NA,their elderly and for their community if the,152
NA,volume of traffic is allowed to continue and,152
NA,Labor fails to deliver on its original promise,152
NA,"to the electorate. However, the promises of",152
NA,the state Labor government will not be ful-,152
NA,"filled. They will not be fulfilled, because",152
NA,state Labor cabinet is rezoning the land on,152
NA,which stage 8 was to be built-land that has,152
NA,been set aside for more than 30 years to be,152
NA,used for this very purpose. The state gov-,152
NA,ernment squandered the good faith of this,152
NA,government and the good faith of taxpayers,152
NA,in my electorate. I remind the member for,152
NA,Fremantle that $15 million and a projected,152
NA,$26.32 million were allocated on the promise,152
NA,that state Labor would drop plans to rezone,152
NA,land designated for stage 8. The federal gov-,152
NA,ernment was very clear that the missing,152
NA,link-the linking of the highway to Freman-,152
NA,tle Port-must be completed.,152
NA,The member for Fremantle commented,152
NA,that Perth has the second highest kilometres,152
NA,"of road per person in the world, with the in-",152
NA,"evitable consequences, according to her, for",152
NA,air pollution and noise. I inform the member,152
NA,for Fremantle that Perth is not a thriving,153
NA,tropolis with a high population density. Fur-,153
NA,"thermore, I inform the member that it is not",153
NA,the amount of roads but the type of roads and,153
NA,their ability to carry traffic that should be,153
NA,analysed. Perhaps the member for Fremantle,153
NA,could explain to the House why she believes,153
NA,the Melville City Council-the local council,153
NA,that administers many of the suburbs where,153
NA,parents find that their children cannot cross,153
NA,road due to the continuous passing of con-,153
NA,tainer loaded road trains-is wasting taxpay-,153
NA,"ers' money. At the same time, perhaps the",153
NA,member for Fremantle could explain what,153
NA,her state Labor colleagues have wasted some,153
NA,of that $76 million of taxpayers' money on.,153
NA,It certainly was not used to build stage 8 of,153
NA,the Roe Highway or the Fremantle eastern,153
NA,bypass.,153
NA,Infrastructure,153
Mr RIPOLL ,Oxley) (9.09 p.m.)-This,153
NA,evening I would like to talk briefly about the,153
NA,nation's infrastructure needs. It seems that,153
NA,wherever you turn these days people are talk-,153
NA,ing about infrastructure. Whether at school,153
NA,"gatherings, at barbecues, over the back fence",153
NA,"or even in the many columns in newspapers,",153
NA,we are all talking about it. In my part of the,153
NA,world it has certainly become the real barbe-,153
NA,cue stopper.,153
NA,"Roads, rail, ports, energy, hospitals,",153
NA,communications and schools all make up the,153
NA,vast network of infrastructure that we all take,153
NA,for granted. But we are becoming increas-,153
NA,ingly aware of their existence. This can eas-,153
NA,ily be explained by people's understanding,153
NA,that the things they use on a daily basis are,153
NA,no longer meeting their needs and increas-,153
NA,ingly are becoming unreliable-individual,153
NA,expectations that when you drive to work,153
NA,"you will arrive on time, that when you turn",153
NA,on the tap you will actually get some fresh,153
NA,drinking water or that when you turn on a,153
NA,switch you will get some light. This acute,153
NA,me- awareness of the things we have taken for,153
NA,granted is the result of a decline in invest-,153
NA,ment in and maintenance of the most essen-,153
NA,tial parts of our society. It is a visible and,153
NA,actual cost to our lives and the liveability of,153
NA,our cities.,153
NA,"There are dozens of reports, many of them",153
NA,"recent ones, that inform us of the growing",153
NA,"population, particularly in south-east Queen-",153
NA,"a sland-or, I should say, the exploding popu-",153
NA,lation in that part of the world. It is expected,153
NA,that there will be over one million people,153
NA,moving to Queensland's south-east corner,153
NA,over the next 20 years and there will be a,153
NA,"need for some 500,000 new homes to ac-",153
NA,commodate them. The thought of how to,153
NA,provide for this number of families on our,153
NA,already congested road and rail networks is,153
NA,frightening-let alone thinking about how,153
NA,we will provide enough water and energy to,153
NA,maintain the lifestyles that drive these people,153
NA,to that part of the world in the first place.,153
NA,"Yet, with all the expert reports, the edu-",153
NA,"cated opinion, the street talk and the obvious",153
NA,"need for investment in infrastructure, it",153
NA,seems to me that there is a less than urgent,153
NA,response from the federal government. It,153
NA,seems that the Commonwealth government,153
NA,is more content to play politics than to pro-,153
NA,vide any real public policy solutions. A great,153
NA,teleexample of the government's drive in this,153
NA,"direction is the national land transport plan,",153
NA,"or AusLink, as it is commonly referred to as.",153
NA,This policy has been much talked about. We,153
NA,have even heard the Deputy Prime Minister,153
NA,compare it to the great Snowy Mountains,153
NA,Scheme-the great nation-building enter-,153
NA,prise of the 1950s.,153
NA,Prior to and during the recent federal elec-,153
NA,"tion campaign, the government used every",153
NA,opportunity to sell the benefits of AusLink to,153
NA,the community. It boasted incessantly about,153
NA,how the government was making huge in-,153
NA,vestments in the nation's land transport net-,153
NA,works. It would go from electorate to elec-,154
NA,torate and it would promise money to much,154
NA,"needed local community projects. And, in",154
NA,"some instances, the same bucket of money",154
NA,was promised to more than one project-but,154
NA,that topic is for another time.,154
NA,One of the fundamental principles of,154
NA,AusLink was the establishment of bilateral,154
NA,agreements between the states and the fed-,154
NA,eral government. While agreements between,154
NA,state and federal governments are essential-,154
NA,including on funding agreements-this,154
NA,should not be interpreted as a green light for,154
NA,the federal government to dump its responsi-,154
NA,bilities onto the states. AusLink was essen-,154
NA,tially understood to mean that funding would,154
NA,be a shared responsibility between both lev-,154
NA,"els of government, with the federal govern-",154
NA,ment playing an active role. That was pre-,154
NA,"election 2004. But, after the election, many",154
NA,of us are now learning that bilateral agree-,154
NA,ments mean something completely different,154
NA,in the context of AusLink.,154
NA,"In the case of AusLink, it means that the",154
NA,federal government wants to bully the states,154
NA,into reform in other policy areas. So we have,154
NA,the government's level of commitment to,154
NA,AusLink and national infrastructure-its,154
NA,greatest plan since the 1950s Snowy Moun-,154
NA,tains Scheme-being conditional on other,154
NA,policy areas. AusLink funding in Queensland,154
NA,is now becoming conditional upon industrial,154
NA,relations reform. This is an unacceptable,154
NA,principle in the delivery of the nation's key,154
NA,infrastructure needs. Many people who,154
NA,thought they were going to get the money for,154
NA,infrastructure projects in their local commu-,154
NA,nities are suddenly finding that these prom-,154
NA,"ises were conditional, that there were strings",154
NA,attached to the funding of AusLink-,154
NA,something they did not know pre election. It,154
NA,"seems we all forgot to read the fine print,",154
NA,ever existed in the first place.,154
NA,A cooperative approach is what is needed,154
NA,to build and maintain the infrastructure that,154
NA,we have become reliant upon and which we,154
NA,"all demand as a key economic driver of jobs,",154
NA,of innovation and of growth. What we do not,154
NA,"want is the divisive policy, based on ideo-",154
NA,"logical nonsense, that we are currently get-",154
NA,ting from the federal government. Infrastruc-,154
NA,ture development should not descend into an,154
NA,us and them debate or a debate about paro-,154
NA,chialism between states and the federal gov-,154
NA,"ernment. If it is to be taken seriously, the",154
NA,Howard government needs to rethink its ap-,154
NA,proach to the nation's most important infra-,154
NA,"structure needs, in particular the AusLink",154
NA,funding conditions.,154
NA,"Mathwin, Mr John, OAM",154
Dr SOUTHCOTT ,Boothby) (9.14,154
NA,p.m.)-I rise to celebrate the life of Mr John,154
NA,"Mathwin, OAM. John was born in 1919 and",154
NA,"grew up in Liverpool. He died in June 2004,",154
NA,just two days short of his 85th birthday. He,154
NA,"was a master painter by trade, and he served",154
NA,with the Royal Engineers 15th (Scottish),154
NA,"Division. He served in the Battle of Britain,",154
NA,was part of the landings at Normandy and,154
NA,was one of the first to cross the Rhine and,154
NA,enter Germany. In 1951 he came to Australia,154
NA,"with his first wife, Gladys, who, sadly, died",154
NA,at the age of 42 when John was the Mayor of,154
NA,Brighton. He joined the Liberal Party in,154
NA,"1953, and he was the Liberal candidate for",154
NA,Bonython in 1955. Although he did not live,154
NA,"to see it, I know how pleased he would have",154
NA,been that much of the old seat of Bonython is,154
NA,now represented by the Liberal Party for the,154
NA,first time ever. He served as a councillor with,154
NA,the Brighton City Council from 1960 to,154
NA,"1971. Later, after 35 years, he returned to the",154
NA,same council as a councillor from 1994 to,154
NA,"1997, and from 1997 to 2003 he was a coun-",154
NA,if it cillor and deputy mayor of the merged coun-,154
NA,"cil, which was named Holdfast Bay.",154
NA,There was no voluntary group in Brighton,155
NA,that John Mathwin was not involved in. He,155
NA,was involved in the South Australian Good,155
NA,"Neighbour Council, Brighton Lacrosse Club,",155
NA,"Somerton Surf Life Saving Club, Glenelg",155
NA,"Rotary Club, Seacliff Youth Centre and",155
NA,Brighton Probus Club. He was involved in,155
NA,Brighton Meals on Wheels from 1962 to,155
NA,2000. For much of that time he was a driver,155
NA,and the president of that organisation. He,155
NA,was involved with the City of Holdfast Bay,155
NA,Concert Band. He was involved with the,155
NA,"Brighton Senior Citizens Club, and he helped",155
NA,"to build their hall, which is now leased from",155
NA,the local council for a peppercorn rent.,155
NA,John was elected as the state member for,155
NA,Glenelg from 1970 to 1985. That seat was,155
NA,"abolished in 1985. He ran for, and was de-",155
NA,"feated in, the seat of Bright in 1985.",155
NA,I would like to share several memories I,155
NA,have of John. I grew up in the seat he repre-,155
NA,"sented in the state parliament, so one of my",155
NA,earliest memories of politics was of John,155
NA,Mathwin's posters on large gum trees along,155
NA,Brighton Road. Now we put them on Stobie,155
NA,"poles, not on gum trees, because people do",155
NA,not like them being on trees. Even back then,155
NA,"it was a problem and, if any ‘greenies' com-",155
NA,"plained, John would say that he was giving",155
NA,them their ‘three-year iron injections'. In,155
NA,1995 I was fortunate to have John Mathwin,155
NA,show me around as a candidate. He took me,155
NA,around to local functions to meet with all the,155
NA,community groups. I am sure that all mem-,155
NA,bers know how useful it is to have someone,155
NA,like that. He also got me roped in to become,155
NA,a driver with Meals on Wheels and a patron,155
NA,of the City of Holdfast Bay Concert Band.,155
NA,"The Liberal Party branch members, who",155
NA,"had been his members for so long, he trained",155
NA,"well. If ever I had a function, one of the",155
NA,"members, Mabs Pearce, would paint a paint-",155
NA,ing and donate it. When she received my,155
NA,material she would go and doorknock her,155
NA,street. It was the practice of an older genera-,155
NA,tion of Liberal voters that I never had to ask,155
NA,for anything; they did all these things off,155
NA,their own bat.,155
NA,To give an example of how long he was,155
NA,"involved in the community, I remember be-",155
NA,ing struck by a plaque at the Seacliff Youth,155
NA,Centre which showed that it had been opened,155
NA,"by John Mathwin, as mayor of Brighton, in",155
NA,1965. It would have been 35 years later that I,155
NA,"was there, when he was deputy mayor of the",155
NA,"successor organisation, the City of Holdfast",155
NA,Bay. I was very proud to be present at the,155
NA,opening of John Mathwin Park in November,155
NA,"2001, the day after the election, and to pre-",155
NA,sent him with a Centenary of Federation,155
NA,Medal in July 2003. He always had a good,155
NA,"word of advice, and he called everyone ‘lad'.",155
NA,"When he retired from council in 2003, he",155
NA,"was interviewed by the local paper, and he",155
NA,said that he hoped to return to Normandy in,155
NA,June 2004 for the 60th anniversary of the,155
NA,"landings. Sadly, he was too ill to travel. I",155
NA,"convey my condolences to his five children,",155
NA,"John, Stephen, Jeanette, Peter and Kaye, and",155
NA,"their families, and to John's friend Cecily,",155
NA,who provided him with so much support. He,155
NA,"helped me enormously, and I will miss him.",155
NA,Indigenous Affairs: Native Title,155
Mr MCMULLAN ,Fraser) (9.19 p.m.)-I,155
NA,rise to challenge the Howard government,155
NA,"and, in particular, the Minister for Immigra-",155
NA,tion and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs,155
NA,to seize an important opportunity to establish,155
NA,the government's bona fides in Indigenous,155
NA,affairs and in native title in particular. Alter-,155
NA,"natively, the government will reinforce the",155
NA,view that it is trying to unwind previous,155
NA,hard-won gains and return to the paternalistic,155
NA,attitudes of the 1960s.,155
NA,The Howard government justifies its cuts,155
NA,to Indigenous programs on the grounds that,155
NA,it is eager to support Indigenous Australians,155
NA,to help themselves. I do not disagree with all,155
NA,the measures it appears the government is,156
NA,"going to propose, if we can believe what is in",156
NA,the leaked incoming government brief-for,156
NA,"example, the ‘no school, no pool' policy has",156
NA,brought some positive achievements in some,156
NA,"communities-however, the evidence to date",156
NA,indicates more enthusiasm for the stick than,156
NA,the carrot.,156
NA,I want to outline tonight an opportunity,156
NA,for the Howard government to put its money,156
NA,where its mouth is. I refer to the question of,156
NA,adequate funding for prescribed bodies cor-,156
NA,"porate, PBCs, under the Native Title Act. A",156
NA,PBC holds and manages native title under,156
NA,the Native Title Act. The Native Title Act of,156
NA,this parliament sets out the functions for,156
NA,"PBCs, which include managing the interests",156
NA,of native title holders but also negotiating,156
NA,"agreements with third parties, such as min-",156
NA,"ers, pastoralists and other developers, who",156
NA,wish to undertake economic activity on the,156
NA,land in question. Both of those parties re-,156
NA,"quire well-funded, competent PBCs, and",156
NA,they are both being let down by the govern-,156
NA,ment.,156
NA,PBCs also have costs imposed on them by,156
NA,"the Commonwealth, by the proper require-",156
NA,ment to meet compliance obligations under,156
NA,the Aboriginal Councils and Associations,156
NA,"Act, but that is expensive, and they get no",156
NA,funding to assist them to do it. Funding for,156
NA,PBCs is not a new problem-it has been an,156
NA,ongoing issue-but it seems to be becoming,156
NA,more acute because of the important statu-,156
NA,"tory roles played by PBCs, the growing",156
NA,number of native title determinations and the,156
NA,"lack of funding for PBCs, especially post-",156
NA,registration of native title.,156
NA,Lack of funding raises important issues ir-,156
NA,respective of whether the PBC covers native,156
NA,title holders in remote areas or Indigenous,156
NA,people who hold native title in townships,156
NA,The issue of resourcing of PBCs was referred,156
NA,to recently in the case of Nangkiriny v.,156
NA,"ern Australia. In that case, Justice North",156
NA,identified an issue that caused him ‘some,156
NA,"concern', as he called it. It related to the",156
NA,Karajarri Traditional Lands Association Abo-,156
NA,"riginal Corporation, the PBC for the pur-",156
NA,poses of section 56 of the Native Title Act on,156
NA,behalf of the Karajarri people in that matter.,156
NA,He said:,156
NA,"It would be an absurd outcome if, after the ex-",156
NA,penditure of such large sums to reach a determi-,156
NA,"nation of native title, the proper utilisation of the",156
NA,land was hampered because of lack of a relatively,156
NA,small expenditure for the administration of the,156
NA,PBC.,156
NA,The judge considered not making the orders,156
NA,in that matter because of the lack of funding,156
NA,"of the PBC, although he subsequently did.",156
NA,"As I said, this issue is not confined to re-",156
NA,mote areas. There is the case of the Lhere,156
NA,Artepe Aboriginal Corporation which was,156
NA,established as the result of a determination of,156
NA,native title for the Arrernte People in Alice,156
NA,Springs. A Northern Territory government,156
NA,submission to the Joint Committee on Native,156
NA,Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait,156
NA,Islander Land Fund outlined the extensive,156
NA,demands being placed on the LAAC to nego-,156
NA,tiate with a large variety of stakeholders like,156
NA,"the Northern Territory government, the Alice",156
NA,Springs Town Council and individual devel-,156
NA,opers. This means that they require resources,156
NA,so that they can conduct that negotiation. At,156
NA,the moment we are missing out on the oppor-,156
NA,tunity. Native titleholders are losing out on,156
NA,"the opportunity to achieve broader social,",156
NA,economic and cultural development for their,156
NA,"community, despite having a determination",156
NA,that their native title continues to exist.,156
NA,"People who want to use the land, the third",156
NA,party interests who want to conduct what is,156
NA,called future acts under the Native Title,156
NA,"Act-developers, miners, sometimes pastor-",156
NA,alists and property developers in Alice,156
NA,West- Springs-cannot get the agreements con-,156
NA,ducted to get that economic activity under,156
NA,way on the land because the body responsi-,157
NA,ble does not have the resources. As one of,157
NA,"them said, ‘I might be a chairman but we",157
NA,cannot afford to buy a chair'. It is literally,157
NA,true in that case.,157
NA,The Commonwealth has tried to pass the,157
NA,buck to the states but these are bodies cre-,157
NA,ated by the Commonwealth to perform func-,157
NA,tions specified by the Commonwealth and,157
NA,are required to comply with regulation speci-,157
NA,fied by the Commonwealth. The bodies are,157
NA,the responsibility of the Commonwealth and,157
NA,not the states and they are being denied the,157
NA,opportunity of funding. There is a report,157
NA,this matter which was commissioned by,157
NA,"ATSIC, paid for by the taxpayers and pro-",157
NA,"vided to the government in October 2002,",157
NA,but the Parliamentary Library cannot obtain,157
NA,a copy for me-even from the consultants,157
NA,who wrote the report. That report needs to be,157
NA,released now. (Time expired),157
NA,Flinders Electorate: Hastings and,157
NA,Somerville Area Development,157
Mr HUNT ,Flinders-Parliamentary Sec-,157
NA,retary to the Minister for the Environment,157
NA,and Heritage) (9.24 p.m.)-I present to the,157
NA,House this evening a plan for development,157
NA,of the Hastings and Somerville areas within,157
NA,my electorate of Flinders. Hastings has,157
NA,evolved as an old fishing town. It has be-,157
NA,come a steel town-a town which is still be-,157
NA,"ginning to change and transform, with",157
NA,younger families coming in. The nature of,157
NA,the town is changing. Somerville is a young,157
NA,family town. Young people have come in,157
NA,from throughout the Melbourne district. It,157
NA,has changed from being an agricultural town.,157
NA,There are four parts to the development of,157
NA,Hastings and Somerville and the surrounding,157
NA,areas of Tyabb and Baxter which need to be,157
NA,considered. The first part is the question of,157
NA,"pride. Hastings produced John Coleman, the",157
NA,greatest full forward in Australian history. A,157
NA,group of people from the Western Port,157
NA,"Chamber of Commerce, led by Peter",157
NA,"MCCulloch, have put together a plan for the",157
NA,creation of a John Coleman statue. It is about,157
NA,"building pride, understanding and a sense of",157
NA,history in the town of Hastings. I commend,157
NA,those who are involved and urge all those,157
NA,who are able to contribute to the funding of,157
NA,"the project, costing over $100,000, to do so.",157
NA,The second part of the development is for,157
NA,marine education for Hastings and Somer-,157
NA,ville through the rubric of cooperation be-,157
NA,tween the Dolphin Research Institute in,157
NA,Hastings and the Australian Maritime Col-,157
NA,into lege. The Australian Maritime College will,157
NA,be setting up a national centre for marine and,157
NA,coastal conservation as part of the proposals,157
NA,at Point Nepean. The opportunity exists and,157
NA,the pledge has been made for cooperation,157
NA,between the Dolphin Research Institute in,157
NA,Hastings and the Australian Maritime Col-,157
NA,lege. I believe that practical marine educa-,157
NA,tion for maritime skills can exist and be de-,157
NA,veloped in Hastings in cooperation at the,157
NA,secondary and tertiary levels. It is a great,157
NA,opportunity for the young people of Hast-,157
NA,ings-Hastings has no significant tertiary,157
NA,opportunities either at the TAFE or the de-,157
NA,gree level-and a step forward in their fu-,157
NA,"ture, which is tied to the particular elements",157
NA,of Hastings interface and history of dealing,157
NA,with the sea.,157
NA,The third element which is critical to the,157
NA,development of the region is the creation and,157
NA,"fulfilment of the long-held commitment,",157
NA,"made in 2002 by the state government, for a",157
NA,Somerville secondary college. The Com-,157
NA,monwealth has already allocated $2 million.,157
NA,That money is there; it is clear; it is on the,157
NA,"table; it is banked. It is ready to be used, yet",157
NA,there has been no significant progress. The,157
NA,school has been delayed; the children have,157
NA,been denied. Families which have expected,157
NA,their children to begin in 2005 have been,157
NA,told that their children will not be able to do,157
NA,so and that they should make alternative ar-,157
NA,rangements. Only in 2006 will families be,158
NA,afforded the privilege of allowing their chil-,158
NA,dren to attend a Somerville secondary col-,158
NA,lege in their own town.,158
NA,Even now that process is being delayed by,158
NA,an extraordinary backflip: the original de-,158
NA,"sign-an internationally leading, first-class",158
NA,design-is not good enough. Instead of hav-,158
NA,ing a modern 21st century design for a,158
NA,"school, the state government are looking at a",158
NA,1960s cinder block combination built up,158
NA,against residences; multi-stories rather than,158
NA,the interesting and innovative pod arrange-,158
NA,ment. It is a backflip; a disappointment. It,158
NA,not only delays the opportunity for education,158
NA,for children within Somerville but also de-,158
NA,nies succeeding generations a national stan-,158
NA,dard school. There is a very simple message:,158
NA,"stick with the plan, stick with the original",158
NA,proposal. Do not be dissuaded. I urge the,158
NA,"state to do that. The Minister for Education,",158
NA,"Science and Training, Dr Brendan Nelson,",158
NA,has said there is funding available at the fed-,158
NA,"eral level. If it is a funding question, I urge",158
NA,the state government to come back for addi-,158
NA,tional funding.,158
NA,The final proposal is for a Somerville po-,158
NA,lice station. My commitment remains clear,158
NA,and absolute: to continue to fight for a,158
NA,Somerville police station and in the interim,158
NA,to encourage local residents and the local,158
NA,community to support the idea of a mobile,158
NA,police van for Somerville. It is a great town,158
NA,but it is in need of additional security. This is,158
NA,both a long-term plan for the security of,158
NA,Somerville and a short-term interim measure,158
NA,"to help the police, who do a great job, and to",158
NA,ensure that they have the resources. Hastings,158
NA,and Somerville are fantastic areas. We have a,158
NA,"clear plan, pride, education and security. I",158
NA,commend this plan to the House. (Time ex-,158

NA,Mr Brendan O'Connor to move:,158
NA,That this House:,158
NA,(1) acknowledges 1 December 2004 as World AIDS,158
NA,Day;,158
NA,(2) acknowledges that the primary objective of,158
NA,World AIDS Day 2004 is to further enable,158
NA,women and girls to take a primary role in chang-,158
NA,"ing the underlying cultural, social and economic",158
NA,barriers which make women more vulnerable to,158
NA,infection;,158
NA,(3) acknowledges that women have a central role in,158
NA,educating their families and their wider commu-,158
NA,"nities about HIV/AIDS prevention, and in sup-",158
NA,porting those with the disease; and,158
NA,"(4) recognises that women and girls are biologically,",158
NA,economically and socially vulnerable to HIV in-,158
NA,"fection and AIDS, and that violence or economic",158
NA,dependence disproportionately increases their,158
NA,chances of contracting the virus.,158
NA,Mr Randall to move:,158
NA,That this House:,158
NA,(1) acknowledges the profound impact autism has on,158
NA,Australian families and the challenges they face,158
NA,"in finding sufficient educational, develop-",158
NA,mental and respite services to help children,158
NA,and their carers with this life long disability;,158
NA,(2) notes that the funding of programs by the States,159
NA,to provide vital support to children with autism,159
NA,is vastly inadequate and causing unnecessary,159
NA,hardship and concern for their families; and,159
NA,(3) accepts that while the States have primary,159
NA,responsibility for the provision of disability,159
NA,"support services, the Federal Government",159
NA,should play an active leadership role in what,159
NA,"is a nationwide issue that affects 1 in 1,000",159
NA,children born in Australia.,159
NA,Mr Johnson to move:,159
NA,That this House:,159

NA,free trade agreements in strengthening bilat-,159
NA,eral relations between countries and produc-,159
NA,ing international trade benefits;,159
NA,(2) recognises the enormous opportunities for,159
NA,Australia in furthering trade arrangements,159

NA,(3) supports the Government's Australia-China,159
NA,Free Trade Agreement Joint Feasibility Study,159
NA,currently underway into the viability of a free,159
NA,trade agreement between Australia and China.,159
NA,Mr Lindsay to move:,159
NA,That this House:,159
NA,(1) recognises that:,159
NA,(a) passive welfare payments to Aboriginal,159
NA,"communities, asking nothing in return",159
NA,"from the recipient, have denied them the",159
NA,pride they deserve and the opportunity to,159
NA,shape their own destiny;,159
NA,"(b) education is the key to change, and that",159
NA,childhood intervention to improve edu-,159
NA,cation will boost employment opportuni-,159
NA,ties and head off longer-term problems;,159
NA,and,159
NA,(c) the leadership capacity of individuals in,159
NA,"local communities must be fostered, and",159
NA,that we should support those Aboriginal,159
NA,leaders who want to stand up and ‘tell it,159
NA,"like it is', rather than dealing with",159
NA,elected or appointed intermediaries who,159
NA,will not be accountable;,159
NA,(2) condemns the violence and unlawful destruc-,159
NA,tion of property in Aboriginal communities this,159
NA,"year, which puts the lives of police and others at",159
NA,risk; and,159
NA,(3) calls on Aboriginal communities to show the,159
NA,leadership they need to move forward into a,159
NA,more successful future.,159
NA,Mr Sercombe to move:,159
NA,That this House:,159

NA,elections in Ukraine has not achieved,159
NA,democratic norms;,159
NA,(d) the most blatant and widespread abuses,159
NA,of the election process in Ukraine are re-,159
NA,ported to have involved the manipulation,159

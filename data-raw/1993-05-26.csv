Mr SPEAKER,Order! The following,12
NA,message from the Senate has been received:,12
NA,The Senate acquaints the House of Representa-,12
NA,tives that it concurs in the resolution transmitted,12
NA,the Senate by message no. 29 of the House of,12
NA,Represeritatives relating to the appointment of a,12
NA,Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital,12
NA,"and External Territories, subject to the following",12
NA,modification:,12
NA,"Paragraph (2), omit the paragraph, substitute the",12
NA,following paragraph:,12
NA,//(2) That the committee consist of 11 members:,12
NA,the Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Com-,12
NA,"mittees, 2 members of the House of Repre-",12
NA,sentatives to be nominated by the Govern-,12
NA,"ment Whip or Whips, 2 members of the",12
NA,House of Representatives to be nominated,12
NA,by the Opposition Whip or Whips or by any,12
NA,"independent Member, the Deputy President",12
NA,"and Chairman of Committees, 2 Senators to",12
NA,be nominated by the Leader of the Govern-,12
NA,"ment in the Senate, 2 Senators to be nomi-",12
NA,nated by the Leader of the Opposition in the,12
NA,Senate and 1 Senator to be nominated by,12
NA,any minority groups or independent Sena-,12
NA,tors.//.,12
NA,The Senate requests the concurrence of the,12
NA,House of Representatives in the Senate's modifica-,12
NA,tion of the resolution transmitted to the Senate by,12
NA,the House.,12
NA,"In relation to this matter, joint committees of",12
NA,this kind are not formed until both Houses,12
NA,have agreed to resolutions of appointment in,12
NA,identical terms. As the next scheduled item of,12
NA,"business indicates, the resolution of appoint-",12
NA,ment of this proposed committee has been,12
NA,"modified by the Senate, and I understand that",12
NA,in considering this modification the House,12
NA,will be requested to make an alternative,12
NA,modification.,12
NA,The appointment of the committee is not,12
NA,"yet resolved. Indeed, it is the very question of",12
NA,the composition of its membership which is,12
NA,the subject of negotiation between the Houses.,12
NA,I feel that no action should occur which could,12
NA,be taken to anticipate the final decision of,12
NA,"either House in this matter. Therefore, it is",12
NA,not appropriate that I report to the House at,12
NA,this stage details of the messages concerning,12
NA,membership of that proposed committee.,12
NA,"However, one of the messages also informed",12
NA,Committee the House of Senate appointments to the Joint,12
NA,Appointment,12
NA,Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and,12
NA,the Joint Standing Committee on Migration,12
NA,Regulations. Resolutions relating to these,12
NA,committees have been agreed to by the,12
NA,Houses in identical form and the details,12
NA,to relating to these committees will be incorpo-,12
NA,rated in the Votes and Proceedings.,12
NA,Ordered that the message be taken into,12
NA,consideration forthwith.,12
Mr BEAZLEY ,Swan-Leader of the,12
NA,House) (10.08 a.m.)-I move: I,12
NA,(1) That the modification of the Senate be dis-,12
NA,agreed to and the following modification be made,12
NA,in place thereof:,12
NA,"Paragraph (2), omit the paragraph, substitute the",13
NA,following paragraph:,13
NA,"""(2) That the committee consist of 12 members:",13
NA,the Deputy Speaker and the Chairman of,13
NA,"Committees, 3 Members of the House of",13
NA,Representatives to be nominated by the,13
NA,"Government Whip or Whips, 2 Members of",13
NA,the House of Representatives' to be nomi-,13
NA,nated by the Opposition Whip or Whips or,13
NA,"by any independent Member, the Deputy",13
NA,"President and Chairman of Committees, 2",13
NA,Senators to be nominated by the Leader of,13
NA,"the Government in the Senate, 2 Senators to",13
NA,be nominated by the Leader of the Opposi-,13
NA,tion in the Senate and 1 Senator to be,13
NA,nominated by any minority group or groups,13
NA,or independent Senator or independent,13
NA,"Senators.""; and",13
NA,(2) That a message be sent to the Senate request-,13
NA,ing the reconsideration by the Senate of the,13
NA,resolution in respect of the modification,13
NA,by the House in place of the Senate modifica-,13
NA,tion.,13
NA,Basically what this does is increase the,13
NA,number of members from 11 to 12. The initial,13
NA,modification which occurred in the Senate,13
NA,was effectively to add an opposition senator.,13
NA,"We were of a mind to accept that, and we did",13
NA,"so in the Senate. However, an anticipated",13
NA,change was not assented to by the Senate:,13
NA,that there be an extra government member,13
NA,from the House. So there is a view on this,13
NA,side of the chamber that the basis on which,13
NA,those arrangements were entered into was not,13
NA,fully conformed with by the Senate. Hence,13
NA,the amendment that we put forward here.,13
NA,It is a general practice on joint committees,13
NA,that a relative balance is maintained that,13
NA,reflects the numbers in the House of Repre-,13
NA,"sentatives, in particular, in these arrange-",13
NA,"ments. Therefore, I have moved to effectively",13
NA,add a government House of Representatives,13
NA,member to the committee. I have no particular,13
NA,reason to believe that if we were to pass this,13
NA,motion the Senate would reject it.,13
Mr TIM FISCHER ,Farrer-Leader of the,13
NA,National Party of Australia) (10.09 a.m.)-Let,13
NA,me say that part of my role as shadow,13
NA,Minister for Trade impinges indirectly on part,13
NA,of the work of the Joint Standing Committee,13
NA,on the National Capital and External Territor-,13
NA,ies. Let me further say that following discus-,13
NA,sion with the Manager of Opposition Business,13
NA,( Mr Howard) the coalition accepts the general,13
NA,convention associated with committee number,13
NA,structure. I gather that the real reason this has,13
NA,all come about is that the Government did not,13
NA,realise that after 1 July the new Deputy,13
NA,President of the Senate and Chairman of,13
NA,Committees will be a member of the coali-,13
NA,"tion, and that is what has caused the altered",13
NA,circumstances.,13
Mr HOWARD ,Is that because we did better,13
NA,in the Senate election?,13
Mr TIM FISCHER,Let me trail that,13
NA,before the House for a brief moment. The,13
NA,coalition did very well in the Senate election.,13
NA,Labor lost Senate positions. The National,13
NA,party did very well in HinkIer and Kennedy,13
NA,"and, I might add, it is a great pleasure not to",13
NA,have the previous member for HinkIer sitting,13
NA,"made in this House, for which the honourable",13
NA,"member for HinkIer ( Mr Neville), a member",13
NA,"of the National Party, can take a lot of credit.",13
NA,But let me come back to the motion. I simply,13
NA,"say to the House, and I also say this to the",13
NA,press gallery and to a lot of political pundits,13
NA,around here-,13
NA,Government members-There's no-one,13
NA,there.,13
Mr TIM FISCHER,AAP can always be,13
NA,relied on to be there and doing a good job-,13
NA,that it is about time that people around Can-,13
NA,berra and around this nation realised that it,13
NA,will be a different Senate from 1 July. After,13
NA,"all, Senator Peter Walsh will have departed.",13
NA,It is about time people realised that it will be,13
NA,"a whole new ball game, and that whilst the",13
NA,election took place on 13 March and changes,13
NA,took place immediately as from the next,13
NA,"sitting of the lower house, the changes in the",13
NA,Senate-most members of the public do not,13
NA,realise this because they do not focus enough,13
NA,on the importance of the Senate-in fact will,13
NA,not take place until 1 July.,13
NA,It is at that time that the composition of the,13
NA,"Senate will change, when we come back for",13
NA,the Budget session. A very interesting legisla-,13
NA,tive circumstance will arise as legislation is,13
NA,dealt with in both Houses of Parliament. We,13
NA,recognise with joy the gains we have made in,13
NA,"the Senate, and we will use those responsibly.",13
NA,"Equally, we are responsible in our approach",13
NA,to this Parliament and will not oppose the,13
NA,motion before the chair.,13
Mr BEAZLEY ,Swan-Minister for,14
NA,"Employment, Education and Training) (10.12",14
NA,a.m.)-in reply-While I am deeply grateful,14
NA,that the Opposition has chosen to preserve the,14
NA,"normal practice in regard to this, and I do not",14
NA,"in any way, shape or form detract from that",14
NA,"gratitude, I think some history needs correc-",14
NA,tion. The fact of the matter is that we find,14
NA,ourselves-,14
Mr HOWARD ,That is passing strange,14
NA,coming from your side.,14
Mr BEAZLEY,We are very good at,14
NA,"history on our side of the House, as the",14
NA,honourable member for Bennelong has had,14
NA,occasion to acknowledge from time to time.,14
NA,He has said quite friendly and kindly things,14
NA,about the Australian Labor Party's devotion,14
NA,"to a sense of history, and how he feels that",14
NA,that is needed in the Liberal Party as well. I,14
NA,think honourable members opposite should,14
NA,press Australia Post very hard for a fiftieth,14
NA,anniversary celebration stamp for the Liberal,14
NA,"Party, and that they should get about doing",14
NA,that as soon as possible. But I digress.,14
NA,"Basically, the problem alluded to was a",14
NA,suggestion that by virtue of a change of,14
NA,numbers in the Senate there will no longer be,14
NA,two government officers presiding. As I,14
NA,understand the arrangements which occurred,14
NA,"in the Senate previously, the minority parties",14
NA,in the Senate-which still have the numbers,14
NA,"in terms of cross-bench control, irrespective",14
NA,of the outcome of the last Senate election-,14
NA,previously decided that they did not like the,14
NA,"Liberal Party nominee for Deputy President,",14
NA,Senator Noel Crichton-Browne. I understand,14
NA,that either the decision has been made not to,14
NA,"put him forward again on this occasion or, if",14
NA,"he is to be put forward again, it is now",14
NA,considered by the minority parties that he is,14
NA,potable and therefore they will be prepared to,14
NA,vote for him.,14
NA,"Whatever the situation is in that regard,",14
NA,is a matter for those parties but the Opposi-,14
NA,tion ought not kid itself that in some way or,14
NA,another it has obtained a Senate majority. It,14
NA,emphatically has not done that. It has agreed,14
NA,to put forward an acceptable candidate for one,14
NA,"of those positions. Be that as it may, there",14
NA,still upon us a requirement to ensure that,14
NA,there is an appropriate balance of opposition,14
NA,and government members on this joint com-,14
NA,"mittee, and I am glad that the Opposition, as",14
NA,"I said at the outset, is standing by past prac-",14
NA,tice in this regard.,14
NA,Question resolved in the afftnnative.,14
NA,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,14

NA,SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT,14
NA,(LISTED SECURITIES) BILL 1993 [S],14
NA,First Reading,14
NA,"Bill received from the Senate, and read a",14
NA,first time.,14
NA,"Mr Tim Fischer-On a point of order, Mr",14
NA,Speaker: the House is placed in a unique,14
NA,situation this morning on two counts. We are,14
NA,about to consider the Social Security Amend-,14
NA,"ment (Listed Securities) Bill, on which you",14
NA,"may be about to make a statement, Mr Speak-",14
NA,er. The honourable member for Berowra will,14
NA,it then lead for the coalition on the following,14
NA,separately listed Social Security Amendment,14
NA,Bill and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amend-,14
NA,ment Bill.,14
NA,The first of those three Bills is a private,14
NA,member's Bill which was introduced by the,14
NA,is honourable member for Berowra here and by,14
NA,"his opposite number in the Senate, where it",14
NA,"was carried. But subsequently, as I understand",14
NA,"the position, the Senate inserted additional",15
NA,clauses in the second and third Bills to be,15
NA,"dealt with here this morning. Certainly, the",15
NA,coalition supports absolutely the first Bill and,15
NA,its contents as they flow through to the other,15
NA,"legislation, as will be detailed by the honour-",15
NA,able member for Berowra.,15
NA,"Mr Speaker, facing the House are two",15
NA,problems on which I seek your clarification.,15
NA,"Firstly, how can we debate this Bill in the",15
NA,knowledge of how matters will be treated in,15
NA,"the other two Bills? Secondly, and more",15
NA,"particularly, what happens if you take a view",15
NA,that the Senate's amendments do not fall,15
NA,within the Standing Orders on the proceedings,15
NA,of the Parliament relating to the drafting of,15
NA,"amendments, leave to introduce a Bill and",15
NA,"like matters? Therefore, I simply seek your",15
NA,guidance and clarification for the House on,15
NA,"this unique circumstance, whilst reiterating",15
NA,our very strong support for the contents of the,15
NA,listed securitieS Bill to end notional capital,15
NA,gains tax.,15
Mr SPEAKER,In respect of the point of,15
NA,order raised by the Leader of the National,15
NA,"Party of Australia, debate on the Bill which",15
NA,the Clerk has just read a first time is to be,15
NA,made an order of the day for the next sitting.,15
NA,A motion to that effect will be moved by the,15
NA,honourable member for Berowra. So the Bill,15
NA,will be considered at a time subsequent to the,15
NA,consideration of the·following two Bills. The,15
NA,Leader of the National Party is absolutely,15
NA,correct: I will make a statement in connection,15
NA,"with the Social Security Amendment Bill, so",15
NA,further consideration of the matter can rest,15
NA,until after that time.,15
Mr RUDDOCK ,Berowra) (10.17 a.m.)-I,15
NA,move:,15
NA,That the second reading be made an order,15
NA,day for the next sitting.,15
NA,I want to emphasise the importance of this,15
NA,legislation being debated at an early oppor-,15
NA,tunity. I note that we have only one more,15
NA,sitting day. This motion is to the effect that,15
NA,the legislation be debated at the next sitting.,15
NA,I assume that arrangements can be made for,15
NA,it to be debated tomorrow.,15
NA,This is a pressing matter. The Department,15
NA,of Social Security is gearing up to administer,15
NA,"this new test, which commences in Septem-",15
NA,ber. If we are to put an early end to that,15
NA,"expensive process, it needs to be done at a",15
NA,time which enables the department to gear,15
NA,up-to gear down might be more appropri-,15
NA,ate-and to stop the process. Otherwise we,15
NA,are only putting the Australian taxpayers to a,15
NA,good deal of expense in computer equipment,15
NA,and subjecting pensioners to intrusive ques-,15
NA,tions about their securities.,15
NA,"If we are to dela): the debate of this matter,",15
NA,the opportunity to put this matter right in a,15
NA,timely fashion is lost to us. As I have moved,15
NA,that the second reading be an order of the day,15
NA,"for the next sitting, honourable members",15
NA,should clearly understand that the next sitting,15
NA,ought to be tomorrow and that tomorrow is a,15
NA,convenient opportunity to bring this legisla-,15
NA,tion forward and to carry it through all stages,15
NA,"to ensure that, well before September, this",15
NA,process that is now afoot is aborted.,15
Mr SINCLAIR ,New England) (10.19,15
NA,a.m.)-I suggest to the House that on many,15
NA,occasions when we have legislation of a,15
NA,similar character we have cognate debates.,15
NA,While I understand the motion is that this,15
NA,matter be made an order of the day for the,15
NA,"next sitting, in this instance there is a time",15
NA,constraint. The payments to which this legis-,15
NA,lation relates commence from September. The,15
NA,two Bills about to be put before the House are,15
NA,"similar in context, if not in substance. I put to",15
NA,the Leader of the House ( Mr Beazley) that for,15
NA,all that the Government might have views on,15
NA,"the matter, would it not be more convenient",15
NA,for the three matters to be dealt with by way,15
NA,of a cognate debate? Each of the issues would,15
NA,"then be put separately to the Parliament, as is",15
NA,of the the normal practice of this place.,15
NA,That would mean that instead of taking up,15
NA,"time tomorrow, or on some other occasion,",15
NA,we would be able to deal with these matters,15
NA,now. It would seem to be the most expedi-,15
NA,"tious way for the convenience of the House,",15
NA,as well as for dealing with a matter that is of,15
NA,"some significance, and of considerable con-",15
NA,cern to members on both sides of the House.,15
NA,Question resolved in the afftrmative.,15
NA,SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT,16
NA,BILL 1993,16
NA,Consideration of Senate Message,16
NA,Bill returned from the Senate with an,16
NA,amendment.,16
Mr SPEAKER,I wish to advise the,16
NA,House that the Senate amendment to this Bill,16
NA,raises an issue to do with the interpretation of,16
NA,the Constitution. Paragraph 3 of section 53 of,16
NA,the Constitution provides that the Senate may,16
NA,not amend any proposed law so as to increase,16
NA,any proposed charge or burden on the people.,16
NA,The Senate amendment to this Bill would,16
NA,overturn changes already made in the princi-,16
NA,"pal Act, and due to be effective from 20",16
NA,September. The substance of those changes is,16
NA,"that, from 20 September, an increase in the",16
NA,value of shares or other listed securities held,16
NA,by a person will be included in the calculation,16
NA,of the person's income for the purposes of,16
NA,benefits.,16
NA,"If the Senate amendment is agreed to, from",16
NA,20 September a beneficiary would not have a,16
NA,"change in the value of shares, et cetera,",16
NA,included in his or her income calculations.,16
NA,Looked at from the point of view of section,16
NA,"53, the matter is unclear. The burden on the",16
NA,"people after 20 September would, in this",16
NA,"aspect, be no greater than it would be before",16
NA,that date. After 20 September the impact is,16
NA,"uncertain. Still, it is probable that some",16
NA,persons would become eligible for a benefit,16
NA,"or for an increased benefit, but a person will",16
NA,not necessarily be better off being on a,16
NA,"dividend basis, as at present, rather than on a",16
NA,"share value basis. Further, notional losses that",16
NA,would otherwise be allowed will not be,16
NA,"available if the amendment is made, thus",16
NA,affecting entitlements.,16
NA,Similar issues arise in respect of the Senate,16
NA,amendment to the Veterans' Affairs Legisla-,16
NA,tion Amendment Bill. It is for this House to,16
NA,decide whether it wishes to take any action on,16
NA,"these matters. In my view, it needs to be",16
NA,recognised that it is very difficult to be,16
NA,confident about the eventual financial impact,16
NA,of the proposals. It also has to be recognised,16
NA,"that the burden on the people may, in this",16
NA,"aspect, be no greater after 20 September than",16
NA,it will be before then. I present a copy of a,16

NA,SENATE AMENDMENT TO THE SOCIAL,16
NA,SECURITY AMENDMENT BILL 1993,16
NA,The Senate's amendment to the Social Security,16
NA,Amendment Bill 1993 raises the issue of the,16
NA,requirement of the third paragraph of s. 53 of the,16
NA,Constitution which provides that the Senate may,16
NA,not amend any proposed law so as to increase any,16
NA,proposed charge or burden on the people.,16
NA,By its inclusion of a new Part lA in the Social,16
NA,Security Amendment Bill 1993 the Senate has,16
NA,proposed a change in the provisions of the Principal,16
NA,Act in so far as the treatment of shares and other,16
NA,listed securities is concerned.,16
NA,The background is that by Social Security Legisla-,16
NA,tion Amendment Act (No.3) 1992 the Parliament,16
NA,inserted changes in the Principal Act to come into,16
NA,effect from 20 September 1993. 1 The particular,16
NA,"changes in question were to the effect that, from 20",16
NA,"September, changes in the value of shares and other",16
NA,listed securities were to be treated in the same way,16
NA,as changes in the value of certain other types of,16
NA,investments. One of the effects would be that from,16
NA,that date an increase in the value of shares would,16
NA,need to be included in the calculation of a person's,16
NA,income and this will mean that in many cases a,16
NA,"person's notional income will be increased, and so",16
NA,their entitlement to a benefit reduced (it also has to,16
NA,be recognised that the reverse could happen and a,16
NA,decline in the value of a person's shares could lead,16
NA,to a notional reduction in income and thus an,16
NA,entitlement to a greater benefit). The purpose of the,16
NA,Senate amendment is to ensure that the changes,16
NA,already made in the Principal Act and due to be,16
NA,effective from 20 September do not proceed.,16
NA,A private Senators' Bill introduced by Senator,16
NA,Patterson2 and subsequently passed by the Senate,16
NA,contained very similar provisions except that it had,16
NA,an additional provision to the effect that although,16
NA,the details of the law would be changed no benefits,16
NA,could be paid or payable until the Parliament,16
NA,passed a law to appropriate the necessary money.3,16
NA,This important qualification has not been included,16
NA,in the Senate amendment to the Social Security,16
NA,Amendment Bill.,16
NA,The issue for consideration is a difficult one,16
NA,because:,16
NA,the amendment does not deal immediately with,16
NA,or alter the particular proposals put before the,16
NA,Parliament in the Social Security Amendment,16
NA,"Bill 1993, rather it changes, in the way de-",16
NA,"scribed, provisions already inserted in the Princi-",16
NA,pal Act but provisions which have not yet come,16
NA,into effect;,16
NA,as is often the case in these matters it is impos-,17
NA,sible to be precise about the financial impact of,17
NA,the change (although it is noted that when the,17
NA,provisions which are now in prospect of being,17
NA,reversed were introduced it was estimated that,17
NA,significant savings would be made4 -but this has,17
NA,been a matter of dispute in so far as it has arisen,17
NA,in connection with the Social Security (Listed,17
NA,Securities) BillS;,17
NA,the change resulting from the Senate amendment,17
NA,"could have an effect either way, depending on",17
NA,whether shares held by beneficiaries increase or,17
NA,decrease in value-ie. only some might receive,17
NA,an increased benefit;,17
NA,the effect in practice is that a particular benefi1993,17
NA,ciary in receipt of a pension before 20 September,17
NA,"this year will, if the Senate amendment is agreed",17
NA,"to, not have an increase in the value of shares",17
NA,included in income calculations after 20 Septem-,17
NA,"ber. On the other hand, if it were not for the",17
NA,"amendment, such a person would have this fact",17
NA,taken into account from 20 September and in,17
NA,some cases a lower benefit would be payable. In,17
NA,other words the effect of the amendment will be,17
NA,"that the ""burden on the people"" will be no",17
NA,greater than it would otherwise be in the period,17
NA,up to 20 September but it will probably be,17
NA,greater than it would otherwise have been in the,17
NA,period after 20 September.,17
NA,A similar amendment has been made by the Senate,17
NA,in respect of the Veteran's Affairs Legislation,17
NA,Amendment Bill. The points made in relation to the,17
NA,Social Security Amendment Bill are also relevant,17
NA,in that case.,17
NA,In the paper prepared in this office and tabled on,17
NA,"9 November 1992, the view was expressed that in",17
NA,"considering such matters (ie., whether any particu-",17
NA,lar proposal by the Senate should be made by way,17
NA,of an amendment or a request) the only satisfactory,17
NA,approach waS for each case to be looked at on its,17
NA,merits; the detail of a proposed amendment needed,17
NA,to be looked at in the context of the bill in question,17
NA,and with reference to any existing principal,17
NA,"tion. It proposed that, rather than applying a strict",17
NA,"test of logic, regard had to be had to the intended",17
NA,and expected practical outcome of the proposed,17
NA,amendments.,17
NA,"In these particular cases, the outcome is by no",17
NA,"means clear. It is certainly possible, and indeed",17
NA,"probable, that, should the amendments be agreed to,",17
NA,because the effect of the 1992 amendments will be,17
NA,"negated, the burden on the people will be greater",17
NA,than it would otherwise be in the period after 20,17
NA,September this year. As noted above however the,17
NA,burden will not be changed by these amendments,17
NA,from the burden applying before that date. In,17
NA,"addition, the effect of the amendment:",17
NA,would be to continue the present regime under,17
NA,which dividends from shares are included in,17
NA,income calculations (the 1992 changes would,17
NA,"have ""income"" calculated on the basis of changed",17
NA,"values, regardless of dividends);",17
NA,could be to allow a fall in the value of a person's,17
NA,shares to be offset llgainst other investment,17
NA,income for the purposes of any entitlement.,17
NA,Whilst this is certainly a matter which should be,17
NA,"drawn to the attention of Members, the issues are",17
NA,such that it is difficult to predict with any confi-,17
NA,dence what the impact will be in so far as the,17
NA,"""burden on the people"" is concerned.",17

Mr SCIACCA ,Bowman-Parliamentary,17

NA,"ty)- Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, may",17
NA,I make some remarks in respect of your,17
NA,statement. Thank you for letting the House,17
NA,know about this matter. The Government will,17
NA,shortly move that the amendment be con-,17
NA,"sidered forthwith. As you have indicated, the",17
NA,"matter is far from clear, but the Government",17
NA,will not object on the grounds that the amend-,17
NA,legisla- ment should have been made as a request.,17
Mr RUDDOCK ,Berowra)-I note the,17
NA,"words you have offered, Mr Speaker. I thank",17
NA,"you for them, and for drawing this matter to",17
NA,our attention. I emphasise the correctness of,17
NA,your conclusion that it would be very difficult,17
NA,to be confident that this amendment would,17
NA,involve additional costs to the revenue. It is,17
NA,one of the major issues of contention between,17
NA,"the Government and the Opposition, as to",17
NA,what the impact of this proposal might be.,17
NA,"The Government has, from time to time,",17
NA,offered some views as to estimated savings,17
NA,that might be made as a result of this· meas-,18
NA,"ure. Therefore, I imagine it would argue that",18
NA,.there will be a cost to revenue if these propo-,18
NA,sals are to be reinstated.,18
NA,The shortcoming-which will be a major,18
NA,matter in the debate that follows-is the basis,18
NA,upon which the Government's calculations are,18
NA,made. It made assumptions that there will be,18
NA,absolutely no changes in the behaviour of,18
NA,people who presently own shares and their,18
NA,ability to assume that the savings that they,18
NA,estimate are likely. It is certainly beyond,18
NA,doubt that pensioners who are shareholders,18
NA,will change their behaviour as a result of any,18
NA,legislative changes left in place after this,18
NA,debate. The impact of those changes will,18
NA,mean that the estimated savings will not be,18
NA,"present. Therefore, Mr Speaker, your com-",18
NA,"ments and observations are quite correct, and",18
NA,I thank you for the support you have given,18
NA,me. It is very difficult to be confident that,18
NA,there are savings to the revenue involved in,18

Mr SCIACCA ,Bowman-Parliamentary,18
NA,Secretary to the Minister for Social Security),18
NA,(10.27 a.m.)-I move:,18
NA,That the amendment be disagreed to.,18
NA,"The current legislation, which was passed in",18
NA,"1992, contains a definition of an investment",18
NA,product and provides for all investment,18
NA,products to have capital gain or loss and,18
NA,income distributions counted when working,18
NA,out a rate of return to be used for that invest-,18
NA,ment under the income test. A listed security,18
NA,is currently included within the definition of,18
NA,"'investment product', thus allowing capital",18
NA,gain or capital loss on a listed security to be,18
NA,counted under the income test. The Senate,18
NA,amendment will remove the word 'listed,18
NA,security' from the definition of an investment,18
NA,product. This will mean that a listed security,18
NA,can only be assessed for income test purposes,18
NA,"under the general definition of 'income',",18
NA,which is not specific enough to allow inclu-,18
NA,sion of capital gain or capital loss.,18
NA,The subject of this amendment has been,18
NA,added on by the Opposition to an election,18
NA,"Bill, where a number of measures are being",18
NA,taken by this Government to ensure that,18
NA,people such as self-funded retirees who are,18
NA,income poor and asset rich might be able to,18
NA,access some parts of social security. There are,18
NA,a number of other measures which are benefi-,18
NA,cial to our elderly and senior citizen popula-,18
NA,tion in this country.,18
NA,"In 1992, the Opposition accepted these",18
NA,"invest- measures, which were passed in December",18
NA,"1992-only some four months ago-yet, for",18
NA,"some reason, straight after the election it put",18
NA,in an amendment which agrees with what the,18
NA,"Australian Democrats have been saying, that",19
NA,shares should not be treated for the purposes,19
NA,of income in terms of the income test rules of,19
NA,the Department of Social Security.,19
NA,I find it very difficult to understand how the,19
NA,Opposition can possibly take this stance,19
NA,"when, even over the last couple of days, it has",19
NA,"been saying to the Government, 'You need to",19
NA,cut your spending'. The Opposition went to,19
NA,the election on Fightback. It talked about $1,19
NA,billion worth of cuts to the social security,19
NA,budget. Yet it is now saying that it will not,19
NA,let us bring in an Act-similar provisions are,19
NA,already in existence-which will allow us to,19
NA,treat invested shares in the same way as other,19
NA,managed investments have been treated since,19
NA,1988. The Opposition will not allow us to,19
NA,have a situation where we have projected,19
NA,savings of approximately $80 million-$60,19
NA,million in the Department of Social Security,19
NA,budget and approximately $20 million in the,19
NA,veterans affairs budget.,19
NA,The Opposition cannot have it both ways.,19
NA,It cannot say on one hand that it was prepared,19
NA,to cut $1 billion off the social security budget,19
NA,and that it wants the Government to cut,19
NA,"spending, and on the other hand not allow us",19
NA,to equitably target what we consider to be,19
NA,situations where some people who do not,19
NA,need to access the social security system are,19
NA,using shares as a means of circumventing the,19
NA,income test.,19
NA,The Opposition cannot have it both ways.,19
NA,It cannot whinge today when in December,19
NA,1992 it passed the legislation in the Senate.,19
NA,Even Senator Patterson-who still has some-,19
NA,thing to do with social security in the Opposi-,19
NA,tion-agreed with the relevant points of the,19
NA,argument for bringing in these measures.,19
NA,I look forward to hearing what the honour-,19
NA,able member for Berowra ( Mr Ruddock) has,19
NA,to say with respect to the so-called exodus of,19
NA,people who are going to leave the share,19
NA,market and invest their moneys in such things,19
NA,"as antiques, collectibles, real estate and",19
NA,antique clocks. We are simply bringing these,19
NA,share treatments into line with other managed,19
NA,investments. As a result of our treating man-,19
NA,"aged investments in a certain way since 1988,",19
NA,the pensioner population has not stopped,19
NA,"investing in such things as equity trusts,",19
NA,property trusts and other sorts of managed,19
NA,"investments. In fact, quite the opposite has",19
NA,happened: there has been an increase in those,19
NA,sorts of investments.,19
NA,Today the honourable member for Berowra,19
NA,has already signalled that the Opposition does,19
NA,not believe that the projected savings will be,19
NA,achieved by these measures. The fact is that,19
NA,the Opposition would not have a clue as to,19
NA,what savings will be achieved. The Govern-,19
NA,"ment, however, is aware of the extent of the",19
NA,savings because we already have the informa-,19
NA,tion on record. Whether the honourable,19
NA,"member for Berowra knows it or not, people",19
NA,do give us details of their assets. We have,19
NA,"been able to ascertain, as best we can, what",19
NA,we believe the savings will be. Since these,19
NA,measures were introduced there has already,19
NA,been an increase in the number of pensioners,19
NA,"who will be affected, and that increase will",19
NA,probably bring in further savings.,19
NA,The Department of Social Security con-,19
NA,siders that the estimated savings are fairly,19
NA,robust. A lot of this information has already,19
NA,been supplied to the Opposition. Pensioners,19
NA,do not appear to be divesting themselves of,19
NA,"shares, despite the widespread publicity this",19
NA,matter has received. A fear campaign has,19
NA,"been generated by some financial planners,",19
NA,ably assisted by members of the Opposition,19
NA,who are obviously trying to score some cheap,19
NA,"political points. They have lost the election,",19
NA,they are devoid of ideas and absolutely,19
NA,"devoid of any policy, but they will come back",19
NA,and change their minds on something for,19
NA,"which they have already voted. What is more,",19
NA,they will actually add it on as an amendment,19
NA,to a Bill that is going to be of benefit to our,19
NA,pensioner community.,19
NA,I find it ridiculous and unconscionable that,19
NA,those opposite will play politics with a situa-,19
NA,tion where we need to ensure that we bring in,19
NA,some of these good measures-which they,19
NA,themselves supported-by a certain time.,19
NA,"They will stop that. If anything, the opposite",19
NA,is occurring to what I am sure Opposition,19
NA,members have been saying publicly and what,19
NA,"they will say here today. Historically, when",19
NA,similar rules were introduced to managed,19
NA,investments pensioners contirtued to invest in,19
NA,that area. It is not in the interests of pension-,19
NA,"ers to gift away their assets, to leave the stock",20
NA,"market, or to run around and put those invest-",20
NA,ments where they will not be getting the same,20
NA,rate of return. They would be worse off if,20
NA,they did that. Regardless of what the Opposi-,20
NA,"tion thinks, pensioners are pretty smart.",20
NA,We have to try to target what moneys we,20
NA,have available to those who need it. We have,20
NA,to ensure that that scarce dollar is made,20
NA,available to those who need it. We cannot,20
NA,have a situation where we have some pension-,20
NA,"ers advised-quite properly, I guess, under the",20
NA,existing rules-by financial planners that they,20
NA,"can divest themselves of income, or circum-",20
NA,vent the social security and the DVA income,20
NA,"test, by arranging to place their moneys in",20
NA,certain shares where they can get capital gain,20
NA,which is not counted for the purposes of,20
NA,social security.,20
NA,The fact is that the number of people who,20
NA,will be affected by this situation will be able,20
NA,to make investment decisions on the basis of,20
NA,"the intrinsic value of the investment, not on",20
NA,"the basis of whether, by investing in a certain",20
NA,"investment product, they will be able to",20
NA,circumvent the income test of the Social,20
NA,"Security Department or indeed be able to say,",20
NA,"'Well, we can access entitlement if we do it",20
NA,this way'. The social security system is there,20
NA,"for those people who need it, not for those",20
NA,who can access their investment to be able to,20
NA,look after themselves first.,20
NA,It does not matter what the Opposition says.,20
NA,It knows that we cannot have it both ways.,20
NA,"We cannot say, on the one hand, open it up",20
NA,"to everybody, let every loophole still remain,",20
NA,and on the other hand say that we have got to,20
NA,cut social security expenditure. I know it is,20
NA,"popular out there with the 107,000 pensioners",20
NA,who may well be affected. I know it is very,20
NA,popular for the honourable member for Be-,20
NA,"rowra and all his henchmen, the people in the",20
NA,Opposition who are running around scaring,20
NA,"everybody, to say, 'You are going to be",20
NA,absolutely wiped out on this'. Of course it is,20
NA,politically popular. The Opposition has got no,20
NA,policies; it has got no ideas. It has got to do,20
NA,something. I guess that is what it has got to,20
NA,do.,20
NA,The fact is that at the end of the day the,20
NA,people who will be affected by these meas-,20
NA,ures will simply have to make investments. It,20
NA,is their personal choice as to whether they,20
NA,keep their money in shares. If they want to,20
NA,"keep their money in shares, that is fine. They",20
NA,"can go to their financial planner and, I would",20
NA,"say that in many instances, they would get to",20
NA,keep their shares. The average portfolio of,20
NA,"shares of pensioners, I understand, is not",20
NA,"much more than $10,000. Yet there are",20
NA,pensioners with shareholdings of over,20
NA,"$100,000 who are drawing the full pension.",20
NA,I know that we do have isolated circum-,20
NA,stances where some pensioners have large,20
NA,shareholdings but they have been able to,20
NA,structure their situation in such a way that,20
NA,they are able to circumvent the income test.,20
NA,I do not think that the honourable member for,20
NA,Berowra can really sit there and look me,20
NA,"straight in the eye and say that that is fair,",20
NA,because he knows that it is not fair. He knows,20
NA,that if the Opposition were in government the,20
NA,first thing it would do is to look at these,20
NA,loopholes which we have been doing now for,20
NA,some time. Already we are trying to target,20
NA,those scarce dollars as best we possibly can.,20
NA,The bottom line of this whole argument is,20
NA,that the social security system is there as a,20
NA,safety net; it is not there to be played politics,20
NA,with. The Opposition is saying to us that we,20
NA,cannot realise those savings that we want to,20
NA,arrange to save. As a result of those savings,20
NA,we have been able to do a lot of other things.,20
NA,We have been able to extend Commonwealth,20
NA,fringe benefits and we are still arranging,20
NA,discussions with the States to see whether we,20
NA,cannot come to a deal with them to get them,20
NA,to extend their fringe benefits as well.,20
NA,I will conclude my remarks at the moment,20
NA,and see what our colleagues on the other side,20
NA,have got to say. I want to say that the Gov-,20
NA,ernment definitely will not accept this amend-,20
NA,ment. The Australian Democrats at least have,20
NA,been consistent on this-I have got to give,20
NA,them that-but the Opposition has changed its,20
NA,mind and I think one needs to wonder why.,20
NA,It is grasping for anything at the moment. It,20
NA,tells the Government to stop spending and,20
NA,"then it says, 'But you cannot have all these",20
NA,savings because as far as we are concerned it,20
NA,is unfair'. We will wait and see what the,20
NA,Opposition has to say. The Government,21
NA,definitely does not accept the amendment.,21
Mr RUDDOCK ,Berowra) (10.39 a.m.)-,21
NA,The Opposition of course presses this amend-,21
NA,ment. I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary,21
NA,to the Minister for Social Security ( Mr,21
NA,Sciacca) that in relation to this it does so,21
NA,good conscience. I do not know how the,21
NA,"Parliamentary Secretary, given what he and",21
NA,his colleagues did with the most vulnerable,21
NA,people during this last election in terms of,21
NA,exciting their interest in a whole range of,21
NA,policies proposals-which the Government,21
NA,walked away from after the election-can,21
NA,come in here and accuse us of playing politics,21
NA,in relation to these matters.,21
NA,The grossest politics that have ever been,21
NA,played with the most vulnerable people in,21
NA,Australia were those played by the Labor,21
NA,"Party when it promised, in good faith one",21
NA,"thought, that it would remove all pensioners",21
NA,"from the taxation system, but immediately",21
NA,walked away from that promise after the,21
NA,election; it promised pensioners a dental,21
NA,"health system, which we now know it is",21
NA,walking away from as hard as it can go; it,21
NA,promised the charities that work amongst the,21
NA,"most vulnerable people that, for every dollar",21
NA,they raised to look after the needy and the,21
NA,"destitute in our community, it would subsidise",21
NA,them dollar for dollar. But what did the,21
NA,Government do after the election? It walked,21
NA,away from that promise as fast as it could and,21
NA,"said, 'Oh, no. We don't have to give you as",21
NA,much if we only subsidise the expenditure,21
NA,that you actually make on the needy. Any,21
NA,money you raise for your running costs won't,21
NA,be covered'. Those opposite are the ones who,21
NA,are trying to suggest that in handling this,21
NA,matter in this way we are playing politics. I,21
NA,have never heard so much humbug in my life.,21
NA,.We are dealing here with a Bill with a,21
NA,number of proposals about which the Govern-,21
NA,"ment is now saying, 'They were promises,",21
NA,"and you, the Opposition, should feel honour",21
NA,bound to implement those promises that we,21
NA,"made, when all the others are promises that",21
NA,we feel we can walk away from'. What,21
NA,humbug!,21
NA,Let me make it very clear to the Parliamen-,21
NA,"tary Secretary, as the Speaker made clear in",21
NA,"his own statement, that these particular provi-",21
NA,sions will not in any way produce savings for,21
NA,this Government. The Government will be as,21
NA,successful in recouping savings in this area as,21
NA,it was with its sales tax imposed on luxury,21
NA,motor vehicles. When the Government legis-,21
NA,"in lated and introduced those provisions, it found",21
NA,that people changed their behaviour. It then,21
NA,had to walk away from those provisions and,21
NA,to repeal them. That is what is going to,21
NA,happen in this very area; the cost of imple-,21
NA,menting these proposals over three years is,21
NA,$3.5 million.,21
NA,Computer. people are gearing up special,21
NA,programs-and I think this probably under-,21
NA,states it-in order that they can trace people's,21
NA,"shareholdings. On top of that, they are gear-",21
NA,ing up to analyse the yields on shares to be,21
NA,able to make certain assumptions about,21
NA,whether or not there have been capital in-,21
NA,creases in the value of the shares that are held,21
NA,by pensioners.,21
NA,"The Parliamentary Secretary is saying that,",21
NA,in relation to these capital increases that occur,21
NA,"in the value of shares, the impact of the",21
NA,proposals will be to reduce the income-that,21
NA,"is, the pension-that is paid to pensioners",21
NA,who own shares. The pensioners will not have,21
NA,"sold their shares, but the Government is",21
NA,deeming that the pensioners will have made,21
NA,"a profit on the value of those shares, and it",21
NA,will reduce the pension as income. On the,21
NA,"Government's own estimates, it is taking",21
NA,"60,000 people-something of the order of 400",21
NA,people in each of our electorates-and reduc-,21
NA,"ing their income by, on average, $1,000 a",21
NA,year. The Government is saying to those,21
NA,"people, 'We know you are going to have a",21
NA,thousand dollars less. You are living on a,21
NA,very meagre income but you can sell your,21
NA,shares in order to survive. Shares are market-,21
NA,able. Sell your shares in order to survive. You,21
NA,can live off that capital increment in lieu of,21
NA,the reduced pension'.,21
NA,Yet in another breath the Government wants,21
NA,us to believe that we can do some calcula-,21
NA,tions-the Parliamentary Secretary has kindly,21
NA,given me these calculations-in which people,21
NA,can estimate program savings. The assumption,21
NA,the Government has made is· that with every,21
NA,pensioner who owns shares it can estimate,21
NA,capital gains and assume that there will,22
NA,always be capital gains in place. It does not,22
NA,"ever look at the prospect, I suppose,",22
NA,"will be a share collapse, as we saw in recent",22
NA,"years, that nobody will change their behav-",22
NA,"iour, or whether the impact of these proposals",22
NA,will yield those savings that it estimates are,22
NA,there to be made.,22
NA,Yet in the other breath the Parliamentary,22
NA,Secretary told us that people will sell their,22
NA,shares in order to supplement their income.,22
NA,He knows in his own mind that people will,22
NA,"change their behaviour. In fact, he is telling",22
NA,"us that, in order to survive, pensioners will",22
NA,sell their shares. He cannot make the assump-,22
NA,tions that he made in relation to the savings,22
NA,that will be made once they sell their shares.,22
NA,The whole point is that the Government,22
NA,made no assumptions about changes in behav-,22
NA,iour when it produced these estimated sav-,22
NA,ings. The Parliamentary Secretary finds some,22
NA,solace in the fact that because additional,22
NA,people have become eligible for pensions-in,22
NA,many cases they would be only part-pen-,22
NA,sions-there has been an increase in the,22
NA,number of people who own shares. From his,22
NA,"brief, he told us that 60 per cent of those",22
NA,people were new pensioners-something of,22
NA,"the order of 16,000 new pensioners who had",22
NA,shareholdings had come into the system-and,22
NA,"a smaller figure, 40 per cent or about 10,000",22
NA,"existing pensioners presumably, had acquired",22
NA,shares.,22
NA,The Parliamentary Secretary says that no-,22
NA,one is deterred from owning shares because,22
NA,of the proposal that the Government intro-,22
NA,duced last September. During the election,22
NA,campaign in March I did not hear a peep out,22
NA,of pensioners or other individuals because,22
NA,they were essentially unaware of these propo-,22
NA,sals. I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary,22
NA,that since the election there has been a good,22
NA,deal of publicity associated with these propo-,22
NA,sals. That is what is hurting the Government,22
NA,so much. That is why some government,22
NA,members are not in the chamber to take part,22
NA,in this debate. I will produce the letters that,22
NA,they are writing to their constituents in which,22
NA,"they say, 'We will have another look at this'.",22
NA,That is what members on the other side are,22
NA,saying as they try to placate the concerned,22
NA,pensioners who are worried about the impact,22
NA,of this measure upon their very meagre,22
NA,that there survival income.,22
NA,The fact is that we support very strongly,22
NA,the amendment to the Bill. We believe the,22
NA,Government ought to accept it. We do not,22
NA,believe it will cost the Government in the,22
NA,long term anything at all to accede to this,22
NA,request.,22
NA,I want to make it very clear that it is not,22
NA,our intent to deny the benefits that were,22
NA,provided for in the original Bill to people,22
NA,who receive newstart and the other benefi-,22
NA,ciary arrangements in place for those who are,22
NA,unemployed; nor do we want to inhibit the,22
NA,assets changes that the Government promised,22
NA,during the election. Our view is that the,22
NA,Government should implement its policy by,22
NA,supporting this Bill with our amendment. It,22
NA,can be done. The Government can support,22
NA,"this Bill with our amendment, and its promis-",22
NA,es will be implemented. That is clear and,22
NA,unassailable. It is for· the Government to,22
NA,decide whether it sees its promises as promis-,22
NA,es worthy of implementation because it can,22
NA,"pass the Bill as amended. If this Bill fails, the",22
NA,failure occurs because of the rigidity of the,22
NA,Government in relation to this matter.,22
NA,We think our arguments are very persua-,22
NA,sive. We think the Government will see the,22
NA,error of its ways and our arguments will cause,22
NA,it to accept this amendment in the context of,22
NA,this debate. (Time expired),22
Mr SCIACCA ,Bowman-Parliamentary,22
NA,Secretary to the Minister for Social Security),22
NA,(10.49 a.m.)-I want to make a few com-,22
NA,ments on what was said by the honourable,22
NA,member for Berowra ( Mr Ruddock). He ended,22
NA,up doing what he normally does: he got,22
NA,"involved in theatrics, thumping the table and",22
NA,that sort of thing. He talked about the humbug,22
NA,of this Government in respect of broken,22
NA,promises. He knows full well that the reality,22
NA,is that the so-called broken promises are not,22
NA,broken promises at all. The only matter in,22
NA,respect of which there has been any change,22
NA,is the matter of the treatment of taxation. The,22
NA,Government has decided to have some further,22
NA,discussions to see whether we can use the,22
NA,money better.,22
NA,In terms of the dental health scheme and,23
NA,"other promises that we have made, the cash-",23
NA,ing out of the home child-care allowance and,23
NA,"that sort of thing, we have not broken promis-",23
NA,"es at all. In some cases, for good reasons, we",23
NA,have had to postpone implementation of those,23
NA,"promises, but we have not got rid of them at",23
NA,all. .,23
NA,The honourable member for Berowra says,23
NA,that these savings will not be obtained. The,23
NA,fact is that in the past the Department of,23
NA,Social Security has been able to make certain,23
NA,"assumptions, because the department does",23
NA,have a lot of information on record in terms,23
NA,of pensioner assets and income. In most cases,23
NA,those assumptions have been fairly well,23
NA,correct. We brought in similar treatment of,23
NA,managed investments in 1988. We made,23
NA,"certain assumptions and those assumptions, as",23
NA,"I understand it, were basically correct. There",23
NA,is absolutely no reason to suggest that the,23
NA,assumptions in this case will not be correct.,23
NA,In accordance with the figures and calcula-,23
NA,tions that have been given to the honourable,23
NA,member and to the Opposition we .have,23
NA,estimated that in the Department of Social,23
NA,Security alone there will be savings to the,23
NA,"tune of $57.47 million. If anything, it is the",23
NA,Government's contention that people have not,23
NA,"been frightened, because they have continued",23
NA,"to invest in shares, although the Government's",23
NA,intention was announced in the Budget last,23
NA,year and they have had plenty of time to look,23
NA,at the matter.,23
NA,Certainly financial planners have had plenty,23
NA,of time to look at it. They are the ones who,23
NA,have been criticising it because they see that,23
NA,some avenues of their business will be affect-,23
NA,ed. They will have to look for other loop-,23
NA,holes. A lot of people have looked at this and,23
NA,decided that it is not as bad as the Opposition,23
NA,makes out. We have made assumptions about,23
NA,the investment behaviour of certain people-,23
NA,Mr Ruddock-Have you? Where is it?,23
Mr SCIACCA,We have made certain,23
NA,assumptions on the basis of what people did,23
NA,when we brought in changes to the treatment,23
NA,of other managed investments in 1988. People,23
NA,did not completely leave managed invest-,23
NA,"ments. In fact, they looked at the intrinsic",23
NA,"value of that investment and realised that,",23
NA,although in some way it would affect their,23
NA,"pension entitlement, at the end of the day they",23
NA,would be better off. Contrary to what the,23
NA,"honourable member for Berowra says, the fact",23
NA,"is that, if people sell their shares and if their",23
NA,"investment behaviour is changed, they arrange",23
NA,to make other investments which will give,23
NA,them an income that will make their lives,23
NA,better. At the end of the day shares are,23
NA,different to property investments and all that,23
NA,sort of thing.,23
NA,The Opposition' makes all these sorts of,23
NA,assumptions. It talks about our making as-,23
NA,sumptions. We have made assumptions on the,23
NA,"figures, on the basis of what is on the record,",23
NA,what has happened in the past with other,23
NA,types of managed investments. According to,23
NA,"the Opposition, those assumptions are incor-",23
NA,"rect. Its assumptions as to what might happen,",23
NA,"as to what might be the case, are plucked out",23
NA,"of the air. At best they are very, very hypo-",23
NA,thetical. Our assumptions are based on avail-,23
NA,"able, detailed information. We reject the",23
NA,argUments put forward by the honourable,23
NA,member for Berowra. There is absolutely no,23
NA,way the Opposition can make the assumptions,23
NA,it is making. We consider that this measure,23
NA,has to be introduced if we are to properly,23
NA,target the welfare dollar.,23
Mr TUCKEY ,O'Cornior) (10.54 a.m.)-I,23
NA,love to hear the Parliamentary Secretary to the,23
NA,Minister for Social Security ( Mr Sciacca) talk,23
NA,about assumptions. There have been some,23
NA,wonderful assumptions made. The honourable,23
NA,member for Berowra ( Mr Ruddock) drew our,23
NA,attention to the assumptions as to how much,23
NA,revenue would be achieved by increasing the,23
NA,"sales tax on luxury cars. In fact, the figure",23
NA,was negative. That assumption was no doubt,23
NA,based on exactly the same sort of information,23
NA,to which the Parliamentary Secretary refers.,23
NA,"Those assumptions, of course, are like the",23
NA,assumptions the Government made that it had,23
NA,the right sort of contract for pay TV; now that,23
NA,assumption is seen to be wrong.,23
NA,Then there was the assumption that the,23
NA,Government had the right to collect tariff on,23
NA,fully built-up motor cars. It assumed it had,23
NA,written that into the legislation. It now discov-,23
NA,"ers that it has not and it has a little problem,",23
NA,"I am told, worth about $1.5 billion. That",23
NA,makes the figures mentioned in this debate,24
NA,pale into insignificance.,24
NA,In recent times the Minister for Employ-,24
NA,"ment, Education and Training ( Mr Beazley)",24
NA,made an assumption that his department knew,24
NA,how to send money down to the universities.,24
NA,He said that there had been a little technical,24
NA,fault and that $900 million had been sent,24
NA,illegally. The assumptions made by this,24
NA,Government are becoming very worrying,24
NA,because they have an administrative vacuum.,24
NA,We know all about the Government's,24
NA,ability to talk; we would like to know when,24
NA,it is going to start running the country. That,24
NA,is the first thing. The Parliamentary Secretary,24
NA,to the Minister for Social Security talks about,24
NA,"assumptions but, if he has received the best",24
NA,"advice, I hope it has done him more good",24
NA,than it has done the Minister for Transport,24
NA,and Communications (Senator Collins).,24
NA,The simple facts are that we are talking,24
NA,about a change which will stop a travesty of,24
NA,justice. The Parliamentary Secretary said,24
NA,something about fairness. I thought that was,24
NA,the principle that applied to all the decisions,24
NA,"we made here, and this is not fair. It is not",24
NA,fair because it sets out to tax-I underline the,24
NA,"word 'tax'-unrealised gains. That, to me, is",24
NA,"a wealth tax. If it has feathers, swims like a",24
NA,"duck and walks like a duck, it is a duck. The",24
NA,Government is introducing the first wealth tax,24
NA,ever to be implemented in Australia because,24
NA,it is taxing people on something they have not,24
NA,got.,24
NA,Mr Sciacca-It doesn't affect their entitle-,24
NA,ments to social security.,24
Mr TUCKEY ,So there is a difference.,24
NA,"The Government says to a person, 'Last week",24
NA,you earned or were paid $100 by government.,24
NA,We have now made a decision that because,24
NA,the value of some BHP shares you hold'-,24
NA,which he probably paid more for than they,24
NA,"are presently valued at-'has increased, we",24
NA,are going to reduce that $100 to $80'. As I,24
NA,"said, if it walks like a duck and quacks like",24
NA,"a duck, it is a duck.",24
NA,The Government is applying a tax to those,24
NA,pensioners by reducing a government entitle-,24
NA,ment. The Government makes some reference,24
NA,to the fact that these people are avoiding,24
NA,some sort of capital gain. Of course they are,24
NA,not avoiding it. Clearly the department can,24
NA,"add that value to their asset value and, as",24
NA,"such, under the assets test the Government",24
NA,"can adjust entitlements, but it wants both. The",24
NA,Government wants to be able to adjust their,24
NA,entitlement under the assets test and get them,24
NA,a bit more regularly.,24
NA,The Government is attacking a specific,24
NA,group of people-those who have chosen to,24
NA,structure their retirement income on the basis,24
NA,of a shareholding. I remind government,24
NA,members that many of these people bought in,24
NA,"at a higher price than currently exists, but the",24
NA,Government is using that low base for the,24
NA,purpose of assessing any increase in the value,24
NA,of these assets. The Government is telling,24
NA,these people to sell off their income base little,24
NA,by little until they approach starvation. That,24
NA,is silly. The honourable member for Berowra,24
NA,is quite right: as they sell off this asset to,24
NA,"compensate for the reduction in their income,",24
NA,the point will eventually. be reached where,24
NA,these people are lOOper cent on the pension.,24
NA,Compulsory superannuation has been,24
NA,"introduced by the Labor Government, at quite",24
NA,"a cost to the productive sector, on the grorinds",24
NA,that it wants to increase Australia's savings.,24
NA,The Government is directing that money to,24
NA,superannuation companies. Why? Because,24
NA,these companies will invest in shares. At the,24
NA,very same time the Government is telling,24
NA,people in another segment of the community,24
NA,that they had better get out of shares.,24
NA,The honourable member for Berowra is,24
NA,quite right. It is all right for the Government,24
NA,to say that it announced this in the Budget. It,24
NA,is unfortunate that every pensioner in Austral-,24
NA,"ia does not read the Budget; in fact, many do",24
NA,not even read newspapers. They will first,24
NA,discover this when they are hit between the,24
NA,eyes with a letter from the social security,24
NA,"department saying, 'Because your share-",24
NA,holding has increas.ed in value according to,24
NA,"our calculations and assumptions, your pen-",24
NA,sion entitlement is decreased by X dollars per,24
NA,fortnight'. That is when they will learn about,24
NA,it and they will find it very difficult to do,24
NA,something about it.,24
NA,If I can come back to the Parliamentary,24
NA,Secretary's assumptions for a minute: he,24
NA,made quite a bit about managed investment.,25
NA,Let me tell him a bit about some of those,25
NA,"managed investments. Firstly, as the honour-",25
NA,"able member for Berowra points out, they are",25
NA,"often contracted arrangements; and, secondly,",25
NA,because of the disaster of the recession we,25
NA,"had to have, many people find they cannot",25
NA,"escape them. Some are unsaleable and others,",25
NA,"of course, have values at which people cannot",25
NA,afford to part with them. I do not think nearly,25
NA,as many of them-,25
NA,Mr Cleeland interjecting-,25
Mr TUCKEY,We are not discussing,25
NA,managed investments today. That has already,25
NA,been dealt with. We are discussing the cir-,25
NA,cumstances of people holding shares. I think,25
NA,the only certainty in all of this is that,25
NA,will vacate that area of investment. If they,25
NA,"do it in a hurry, there will be an effect on",25
NA,"share markets of Australia; and that, of",25
NA,"course, is not interesting.",25
NA,Mr Sciacca-Wrong.,25
Mr TUCKEY,The Parliamentary Secre-,25
NA,"tary says, 'Wrong'. As I said, he comes from",25
NA,a background of about five mess-ups. He,25
NA,comes from the background of the pay TV,25
NA,fiasco. Why should we trust his judgment on,25
NA,anything? I am telling the Parliamentary,25
NA,"Secretary that, once people get the message",25
NA,that they are to be taxed on their unrealised,25
NA,"gains, they will immediately find",25
NA,ments where that does not apply. That will,25
NA,remove a substantial level of investment for,25
NA,"the share market, which I thought the Govern-",25
NA,ment wanted to encourage.,25
NA,These sorts of situations have to be con-,25
NA,"sidered. First, is it true that it will generate",25
NA,the level of revenue for the Government? Our,25
NA,"belief is that it will not. Of course, we can",25
NA,produce precedents where these sorts of,25
NA,decisions have been taken in the past. People,25
NA,have a choice.,25
NA,Mr Sciacca-In social security?,25
Mr TUCKEY ,It does not matter whether,25
NA,it is in social security or somewhere else. It,25
NA,is a case of people making a decision. Years,25
NA,ago when our Government increased the tax,25
NA,on alcohol and put a figure in the Budget we,25
NA,got a terrible shock. People jacked up and for,25
NA,a period of time the reve-ue of that increased,25
NA,percentage was actually less. People do make,25
NA,these sorts of decisions.,25
NA,Mr Gibson-It did recover.,25
Mr TUCKEY,"Oh, the honourable mem-",25
NA,ber for Moreton reckons it will recover over,25
NA,the next 20 years. It might. We are talking,25
NA,about an area where there is no obligation.,25
NA,The Parliamentary Secretary was at pains to,25
NA,tell us that they can sell out. The simple fact,25
NA,"is they will, at which time the Government",25
NA,will not have the necessary revenue.,25
NA,"In the meantime, we are generating substan-",25
NA,"tial hardship for people, particularly those",25
NA,who made their share investments in more,25
NA,"prosperous times, before the recession we had",25
NA,"people to have, and who are sticking with those",25
NA,"all shares, as many have stuck with their man-",25
NA,"the aged investments, hoping to simply recover",25
NA,their original investment. The Government is,25
NA,"saying, 'If you want to be in that position and",25
NA,your shares have to increase possibly 100 per,25
NA,cent in value before you recover your original,25
NA,"investment, we will tax you through reduced",25
NA,pensions for every cent of gain'. That is what,25
NA,the Government is on about. I think it is,25
NA,outrageous. I think at the very least it should,25
NA,have taken the position of valuing those,25
NA,"shares at what they cost, not what they are",25
NA,presently worth. But even then I would,25
NA,perceive it as introducing the thin end of the,25
NA,other invest- wedge for a wealth tax.,25
NA,The Government had the academics out on,25
NA,"the hustings for a little while, using a",25
NA,"Hawkeism, saying that it was an obscenity",25
NA,that we did not have death duties and wealth,25
NA,taxes. I bet the Parliamentary Secretary will,25
NA,not deny to this Parliament that there has,25
NA,been a little bit of backchat in the corridors,25
NA,relating to that as a prospective means of,25
NA,increasing its revenue. But the Government,25
NA,"has done it already through this measure, and",25
NA,there is every reason why the Opposition,25
NA,should oppose it on those grounds.,25
NA,The Government is attacking investment in,25
NA,shares. The Government is being specific,25
NA,about it and is reducing it. We read about the,25
NA,mums and dads trying to get into the,25
NA,Woolworths float at this time. We should be,25
NA,encouraging the community in that regard.,25
NA,(llme expired),25
Mr CLEELAND ,MCEwen) (11.04 a.m.)-,26
NA,I listened with interest to the discussion of,26
NA,honourable member for O'Connor ( Mr,26
NA,Tuckey) about ducks. He said that if it flies,26
NA,"like a duck, if it quacks like a duck, if it has",26
NA,"feathers like a duck, it is a duck. That might",26
NA,"make the honourable member in fact a goose,",26
NA,"because the main duck flies like a duck,",26
NA,quacks like a duck and has feathers like a,26
NA,"duck, but it is a goose. I think the honourable",26
NA,gentleman is rather confused not just about,26
NA,ducks but about geese. If this is the quality of,26
NA,debate we get in this place from the Opposi-,26
NA,"tion, it is a great worry.",26
NA,These are the fiscal dragons of Australia;,26
NA,"these are the people who, only a short time",26
NA,"ago, were going to cut $10 billion from the",26
NA,Commonwealth's expenditure base. They,26
NA,were out there saying to the Australian peo-,26
NA,"ple, 'Don't run away from it now-$10",26
NA,"billion'. Those opposite said, 'We can do it.",26
NA,We can do this and deliver to you because we,26
NA,have $10 billion worth of tax cuts'. These,26
NA,were the big conservative promises by the,26
NA,fiscal dragons who were going to make this,26
NA,magnificent cut to Commonwealth expendi-,26
NA,ture. Those opposite were going to cut $1,26
NA,billion from the social security base-,26
Mr TUCKEY ,What about the pensioners?,26
NA,Mr Ruddock-Tell us what you are going,26
NA,to tax the pensioners of MCEwen.,26
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN , Mr,26
NA,Hollis)-Order! The honourable member for,26
NA,"Berowra knows that he should not interject,",26
NA,and so does the honourable member for,26
NA,O'Connor.,26
Mr CLEELAND,It is all cant and hypoc-,26
NA,risy so it does not matter that much in terms,26
NA,of this debate. Those opposite come here,26
NA,without clean hands; they come to this debate,26
NA,with very dirty hands indeed. The Opposition,26
NA,was going to cut $1 billion from the social,26
NA,seturity budget. But did it tell the Australian,26
NA,"people, or indeed has it told this House,",26
NA,where the $1 billion cut would have come,26
NA,from? If we start at page 1 of Fightback and,26
NA,"go right through to the end, nowhere will we",26
NA,find any statement about $1 billion worth of,26
NA,savings from social security. There is no,26
NA,detailed explanation-none whatsoever. So,26
NA,the Opposition ran to the election promising,26
NA,a $10 billion tax cut and a $1 billion cut to,26
NA,the social security. These are the big fiscal dra-,26
NA,gons.,26
NA,In this House today we are debating a very,26
NA,rational approach to reducing the demand on,26
NA,"the public purse in social security, but those",26
NA,opposite oppose it. It is typical of honourable,26
NA,"members opposite-typical of their hypocrisy,",26
NA,typical of their cant and typical of the fact,26
NA,that the Australian people cannot trust any-,26
NA,thing those opposite say or do. The Australian,26
NA,people understand that.,26
NA,We are talking about a form of investment,26
NA,which is no different in terms of capital,26
NA,growth to a managed investment as defined in,26
NA,"the Act. For example, pensioners can invest",26
NA,in what is defined in the Act as a managed,26
NA,investment where the capital growth is,26
NA,brought into account for income as termed,26
NA,under the Act. Equity trusts come within the,26
NA,managed investment phraseology and termi-,26
NA,nology of the Act. I have not heard anyone on,26
NA,the other side of the House say that it is,26
NA,wrong to do that.,26
NA,The honourable gentleman from Berowra,26
NA,has not said that it is wrong to bring managed,26
NA,investment capital growth into income defini-,26
NA,tional terms for the purposes of assessing the,26
NA,benefit to be paid under the Act. So there is,26
NA,"no difference. Very simply, we are talking",26
NA,about the fact that shares are a security which,26
NA,is transferable at will. Many people use shares,26
NA,as a means of making income by buying and,26
NA,selling. It is very simple. Those opposite,26
NA,"know that and we know that, and I take it that",26
NA,those opposite do not disagree that people do,26
NA,that in the share market. People go into the,26
NA,"market, buy low, sell high and make a profit.",26
NA,"Mr Ruddock-If the pensioner did it, the",26
NA,income test would apply.,26
Mr CLEELAND,They declare that for,26
NA,income tax purposes. That is what people use,26
NA,the market for. Some people invest on the,26
NA,market to gain a dividend growth-an income,26
NA,growth-or they invest in a different quality,26
NA,"of share and gain income. Of course, the",26
NA,dividends from shares are already brought to,26
NA,account as income through the income test,26
NA,under the Act. So the Opposition is saying it,26
NA,"is okay to bring in dividend accounts, but",26
NA,when people are using the share market to,26
NA,"buy and sell, using the capital growth to form",27
NA,"income, that is somehow different-there",27
NA,a different quality to that kind of investment.,27
NA,Mr Truss-Wrong.,27
Mr CLEELAND,Honourable members billion,27
NA,"opposite are great, are they not? They are",27
NA,"saying that somehow that is different, but",27
NA,have listened to the speakers from the other,27
NA,side and they have not quantified or 'qualified,27
NA,"why it is different. For example, the honourWe",27
NA,able member for Berowra said earlier that,27
NA,proposal will not produce any savings. I think,27
NA,"he spoke for about 20 minutes, but the whole",27
NA,theme of his speech was that this will not,27
NA,produce any savings. He did not quantify,27
NA,what he m-t by that; nor did he produce,27
NA,one iota of evidence to this House to indicate,27
NA,that the figures produced by the department,27
NA,are wrong. He simply got up in the House,27
NA,"and said that it will not produce any savings,",27
NA,and he then spent 20 minutes not defining,27
NA,what he meant by 'savings'.,27
NA,"A lot of other speakers, in the usual",27
NA,"vatiw, hypocritical way-jumping on the",27
NA,political bandwagon-will stand up here and,27
NA,"say, 'Look how we are looking after",27
NA,pensioners'. The newspapers will be full of,27
NA,stories of opposition members saying they tion members.,27
NA,care about and love pensioners while at the,27
NA,same time claiming to be the fiscal,27
NA,the Australian political scene. So they will go,27
NA,"out there and say to pensioners, 'We oppose",27
NA,"this dreadful measure. But, mind you, we",27
NA,think the Government will cut $1 billion off,27
NA,"you somewhere down the line'. However,",27
NA,those opposition members will oppose it for,27
NA,"political purposes right now, knowing they",27
NA,will cop it out in the electorate. But their,27
NA,logic is just as crazy; they supported the,27
NA,legislation last year.,27
NA,Mr Ruddock-We haven't broken promisyet,27
NA,es like you.,27
Mr CLEELAND,They supported the sy.,27
NA,legislation last year.,27
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,Order! The and,27
NA,honourable member for Berowra,27
NA,interject.,27
Mr CLEELAND,They supported the -This,27
NA,legislation last year before the election.,27
NA,had an election in which the Australian,27
NA,"people said, 'You belong on that side of the",27
NA,"is House' -and they put those 0ppQsite there,",27
NA,quite properly in my view. They come back,27
NA,into this Parliament after supporting the,27
NA,"legislation and having been told, 'Your $10",27
NA,cuts are unacceptable'. When the,27
NA,"Government comes back in, opposition sena-",27
NA,"I tors get up in the Senate, change their minds",27
NA,"after the election and say, 'We really do care",27
NA,"about giving benefits to people, not cutting.",27
NA,really care about this after all'. They then,27
NA,"the come back in, bring it down to this House-",27
NA,Mr Sciacca-Their new found heart.,27
Mr CLEELAND,Their new found heart.,27
NA,Over here one can just about hear it beating-,27
NA,pumping and palpitating while they care for,27
NA,pensioners. They come back in here and now,27
NA,they oppose it. What must people out there,27
NA,really think of you lot. How can any of you,27
NA,sit there and feel comfortable about what you,27
NA,are doing? How can you really do that? How,27
NA,can you really believe and support what you,27
NA,conserare saying in this chamber today?,27
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,Order! I,27
NA,am loathe to interrupt the honourable member,27
NA,but he really should address his remarks,27
NA,through the Chair and not directly to opposi-,27
NA,"Mr Ruddock-If you do it to me, I will",27
NA,giants of object on the spot.,27
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,The honour-,27
NA,"able member for Berowra will remain silent,",27
NA,not interject and not protoke.,27
Mr CLEELAND,I will not take up the,27
NA,"time of the committee for too long because,",27
NA,"quite frankly, we are listening to a political",27
NA,debate. It is a debate through which opposi-,27
NA,tion members will gain a bit of politics out,27
NA,there among pensioners to try to frighten them,27
NA,again. Opposition members should be,27
NA,"ashamed for running such a debate because,",27
NA,"once again, they have exposed their hypocri-",27
NA,I hope the debate is finished quickly so,27
NA,that we can get this Bill back to the Senate,27
NA,impose the legislation as people fully,27
NA,should not expect it to be imposed.,27
Mr CONNOLLY ,Bradfield) (11.14 a.m.),27
NA,debate on the Social Security Amend-,27
NA,We ment Bill is another example of a government,27
NA,which has made an art form of the politics of,27
NA,"compassion on the one hand and, since the",28
NA,"election, the politics of deception on the",28
NA,other. When this legislation was first intro-,28
NA,duced into the chamber in November last,28
NA,"year, it was no less than a Trojan horse; it",28
NA,was a political piece of paper. It was a docu-,28
NA,ment brought in here deliberat-ly to try to,28
NA,embarrass the Opposition. It was couched in,28
NA,"terms which said to the Opposition, 'If you",28
NA,"oppose the nasties in this Bill, we will be able",28
NA,"to go to the 900,000 or so pensioner benefi-",28
NA,"ciaries in this legislation and say, ""It is the",28
NA,Opposition which is stopping you getting your,28
NA,"pension increases'"" -a blatant, clear-cut,",28
NA,political act.,28
NA,This morning the Parliamentary Secretary,28
NA,to the Minister for Social Security ( Mr,28
NA,Sciacca) came in here and suggested to the,28
NA,"Opposition, 'But you supported the Bill'.",28
NA,honourable gentleman has chosen to forget,28
NA,that of course we supported the proposals,28
NA,increase benefits to welfare recipients. Most,28
NA,of them are there because of the policies,28
NA,"this Labor Government. Of course we supand,",28
NA,ported those people getting improvements,28
NA,"their standard of living, small though they",28
NA,may be. But we also took the opportunityfixed,28
NA,"and many opposition speakers did so, includsecurities.",28
NA,ing myself when I led the debate-to make,28
NA,the point that the proposals on the inclusion,28
NA,of unrealisable capital gains had some serious,28
NA,problems.,28
NA,For us to do anything less than that,28
NA,be to deny our resp&.sibility to the Australian,28
NA,"people, especially to those 107,000 pension-",28
NA,"ers-a new figure on the 80,000 referred to in",28
NA,November last year-who are facing the,28
NA,reality of a fundamental change in the strucrushing,28
NA,ture of their income. I made it clear on that,28
NA,occasion that the Opposition believed that this,28
NA,aspect of the Bill should be reviewed. We,28
NA,gave a commitment then that in the event of,28
NA,our winning the election there would most country.,28
NA,certainly be a review. As the honourable,28
NA,member for Berowra ( Mr Ruddock) has,28
NA,clearly identified in his private member's,28
NA,"since then, if we were in government we",28
NA,would simply remove these proposals from investor,28
NA,the legislation.,28
NA,I also called on the Government on that,28
NA,occasion to carry out a thorough review of,28
NA,assets test because the fundamental problem,28
NA,in all of this is the assets test itself and the,28
NA,way in which that test is being applied by this,28
NA,Government.,28
NA,Mr Ruddock-It is just shifting the boun-,28
NA,daries.,28
Mr CONNOLLY,That is correct. One of,28
NA,the documents given to the shadow Minister,28
NA,noted the following: 72 per cent of pensioners,28
NA,"most commonly invested in bank investments,",28
NA,"11 per cent in bonds and debentures, and",28
NA,seven per cent in managed investments; less,28
NA,than six per cent of pensioners own real,28
NA,"estate, apart from their own home; and only",28
NA,approximately one per cent of pensioners,28
NA,receive income from real estate. Most pen-,28
NA,sioners who hold real estate are likely to do,28
NA,"so for lifestyle reasons-for example, holiday",28
NA,The homes-rather than investment purposes. The,28
NA,reason the Government wanted to make this,28
NA,"to reform is that, consequent to the changes in",28
NA,"1988, it noted an increase in the number of",28
NA,of people making investments through shares,28
NA,"therefore, a decreased number of people",28
NA,in making investments through fixed interest,28
NA,"securities; in other words, a transfer from",28
NA,interest securities to market linked,28
NA,"Clearly, that demonstrates that the market",28
NA,"out there-that is, the shareholder component",28
NA,of pensioners and people who had additional,28
NA,investments-was perfectly capable of making,28
NA,would judgments in its best interests.,28
NA,Mr Ruddock-Rational decisions.,28
Mr CONNOLLY,That is correct. The,28
NA,Government simply spends its time madly,28
NA,around trying to put plugs in empty,28
NA,bottles. It finds one bottle which has a prob-,28
NA,lem so it looks for another sized cork to fit,28
NA,into it. The problem is really the structure of,28
NA,the assets test as it currently applies in this,28
NA,I made some observations on 5 November,28
NA,last year which I think need to be repeated in,28
NA,Bill this context. I gave some examples of what,28
NA,effect these proposals will have on actual,28
NA,pensioners. It is also worth noting the,28
NA,figures which were quoted then by the Gov-,28
NA,ernment. It said six per cent would be affect-,28
NA,the ed. One of the estimates given to me by the,28
NA,"department was that 84,000 pensioners would",29
NA,be affected; now we know the figure is,29
NA,"107,000. Of that number, 20,000 would have",29
NA,a pension reduction of less than $10 a week;,29
NA,"1,500 would have a reduction of $100 a",29
NA,"week; and 150, with shareholdings of $60,000",29
NA,"or more, would be liable to have their part-",29
NA,pensions cancelled unless they fundamentally,29
NA,changed the structure of their holdings. A,29
NA,press report suggested that the average pen-,29
NA,sioner would lose up to $700 per year in,29
NA,"pension. Of course, that was disputed by the",29
NA,"Government, but as the numbers have now",29
NA,gone up I think the Parliamentary Secretary,29
NA,"should once again state, for the benefit of the",29
NA,"chamber, precisely what the anticipated",29
NA,statistics are.,29
NA,"One of the examples I gave, which goes to",29
NA,"the crux of this whole problem, concerned a",29
NA,pensioner with a mixed portfolio of say,29
NA,"$20,000-we were told that the average at",29
NA,"that time was $15,000 and I would like the",29
NA,Parliamentary Secretary to tell us what the,29
NA,average is now; it may have gone up-,29
NA,returning a fully franked dividend of say,29
NA,"$1,000 and an unrealised capital gain of",29
NA,"$2,000. At present the dividend of $1,000 is",29
NA,"counted under the income test, reducing the",29
NA,pension by $500 at the rate of SOc in the,29
NA,dollar. That is the current arrangement. We all,29
NA,understand that.,29
NA,But under the legislation as proposed,29
NA,"time and as it will be implemented, that same",29
NA,"pensioner's unrealised capital gain of $2,000",29
NA,"will cost a further loss of $1,000 on that",29
NA,"pension. The net overall effect, counting",29
NA,"dividend and capital gain, is therefore a net",29
NA,"loss of $1,500. That is clearly, by any stretch",29
NA,"of the imagination,. a fundamental change in",29
NA,the potential for disposable income of a,29
NA,person on that income level.,29
NA,"Alternatively, to protect the pension, the",29
NA,pensioner could realise the capital gain-as,29
NA,the Government obviously wishes-and pay,29
NA,capital gains tax plus the SOc in the dollar,29
NA,"withdrawal rate on the pension, resulting in an",29
NA,effective marginal rate of tax of approximate-,29
NA,ly 66c in the dollar. I ask my colleagues: is,29
NA,anybody in the work force in this country,29
NA,asked to pay 66c in the dollar income tax?,29
NA,The answer is clearly no. But if a pensioner,29
NA,has some shareholdings and some small,29
NA,"dividend income it is hard luck, because that",29
NA,pensioner will be up for 66c in the dollar.,29
NA,I have not given all the bad news yet. In,29
NA,"addition to that, there are brokerage charges",29
NA,of approximately one per cent to two per cent.,29
NA,"In November last year, I asked the Govern-",29
NA,ment to make the necessary amendments to,29
NA,the Act-they were not there; I looked very,29
NA,closely at that-to exclude at least those,29
NA,additional costs from the considerations.,29
NA,Mr Sciacca-We did.,29
Mr CONNOLLY,It may have been done,29
NA,"in the Senate, but it was certainly not in the",29
NA,Bill when it came before the House of Repre-,29
NA,"sentatives. If that is now deductible, I am",29
NA,pleased. It is at least some demonstration of,29
NA,commonsense in an otherwise pretty hopeless,29
NA,situation.,29
NA,The overall outcome is that the only way to,29
NA,avoid the assessment of unrealised capital,29
NA,gain would be. to invest in property to circum-,29
NA,vent the income test. We have been told in,29
NA,the statistics I quoted earlier that very few,29
NA,people-six per cent-do that. The other,29
NA,point which has been raised by people in the,29
NA,industry and which I think is worth noting is,29
NA,that a pensioner could buy shares offshore and,29
NA,"therefore circumvent these proposals. Again,",29
NA,this is an issue which I think the Parliamen-,29
NA,at that tary Secretary should refer to.,29
NA,I want to put to bed once and for all this,29
NA,furphy coming from government members,29
NA,about our allowing the passage of this Bill,29
NA,"last year for very sound, ethical, equity and",29
NA,"political reasons because, as I said, we were",29
NA,not going to be caught in the Trojan horse,29
NA,trap that the Government had set for us. We,29
NA,raised these fundamental problems then and,29
NA,we have gone even further. We have devel-,29
NA,oped a private member's Bill to reinforce the,29
NA,fact that those problems are still very much in,29
NA,place. Here we are for the second time simply,29
NA,asking the GoveIll11lent to face up to the fact,29
NA,that there are problems here. The formula,29
NA,which is being applied must be reviewed.,29
NA,(TIme expired),29
Mr GIBSON ,Moreton) (11.24 a.m.)-,29
NA,Probably the only thing about the contribution,29
NA,to this debate by the honourable member for,29
NA,Bradfield ( Mr Connolly) that I agreed with,30
NA,was his comment that this debate was domi-,30
NA,nated by a blatant act of political expediency.,30
NA,One has to make the point that the most,30
NA,blatant act of political expediency is occurring,30
NA,on the part of the Opposition.,30
NA,Let us get down to brass tacks as to. why,30
NA,the Opposition has reversed the position that,30
NA,it took a couple of months ago. The pension-,30
NA,ers of this country saw through the Opposition,30
NA,and deserted it in droves at the last election.,30
NA,The pensioners of this country knew exactly,30
NA,what the Opposition would do to them if it,30
NA,ever got into power. They saw what the,30
NA,Opposition had in its platform and they knew,30
NA,that they would suffer dramatic falls in their,30
NA,living standards and income if they allowed,30
NA,the Opposition to gain power. Those opposite,30
NA,lost the pensioner vote across this country.,30
NA,Now we have this desperate scrambling by,30
NA,the Opposition to try to curry favour with,30
NA,some pensioner groups because it realises that,30
NA,it is in desperate straits as far as its political,30
NA,support amongst older Australians is con-,30
NA,cerned. That is why we now have this back-,30
NA,flip by the Opposition and why this beat-up,30
NA,debate is occurring once more in this chamber,30
NA,about this issue.,30
NA,This debate has been absolutely dominated,30
NA,"by furphies and by conspiracy theories, and",30
NA,each opposition spokesman has trotted out a,30
NA,whole series of allegations about what is,30
NA,going to happen. It is said that·history repeats,30
NA,"itself, and in this chamber we have history",30
NA,once more repeating itself in this debate about,30
NA,social security measures. Every time this,30
NA,Government has introduced new measures to,30
NA,better target social security provisions in this,30
NA,"country, the Opposition has been beating its",30
NA,chest and filling the whole community with,30
NA,fear and hysteria about how awful and dread-,30
NA,ful this measure will be and how thousands of,30
NA,people will suffer.,30
NA,We remember the way in which the Opposi-,30
NA,tion totally abused the pensioner community,30
NA,in this country over the assets test; the way in,30
NA,which the Opposition led the community by,30
NA,the nose and filled people with fear about the,30
NA,impact of that test. Members of the Opposi-,30
NA,tion now know that none of those fears were,30
NA,"realised, but the way they acted in that debate",30
NA,was a total disgrace. A lot of people were,30
NA,scared about what was going to happen and,30
NA,what impact the assets test would have.,30
NA,A couple of years ago we had a similar,30
NA,instance with the Opposition taking great,30
NA,pains to scare people over the deeming,30
NA,provisions that were brought in to impact on,30
NA,social security payments. Again we had the,30
NA,Opposition beating up a scare campaign and,30
NA,telling pensioners that all sorts of dreadful,30
NA,things were going to happen with the deeming,30
NA,"provisions. Once more, none of those fearful",30
NA,things occurred. The deeming provisions were,30
NA,introduced and pensioners found that they,30
NA,made more money through those provisions,30
NA,than they had previously. They found that,30
NA,their savings were starting to earn a reason-,30
NA,able income from bank interest rather than the,30
NA,paltry amounts that the banks had been,30
NA,paying in the past.,30
NA,Let us have a look at the way in which the,30
NA,Opposition goes on in these debates. In its,30
NA,Fightback package the Opposition put forward,30
NA,to the people of this country that it wanted to,30
NA,slash some $10 billion from social welfare,30
NA,payments; yet each time the Government,30
NA,looks at better targeting social security pay-,30
NA,ments and making reasonable cost savings it,30
NA,is attacked and vilified by the Opposition. The,30
NA,Government is not looking to save money but,30
NA,is trying to spread the benefits of social,30
NA,security to more people. Money is not put,30
NA,back into Consolidated Revenue. Even though,30
NA,"this measure was introduced, in the last",30
NA,Budget the amount of money paid in social,30
NA,welfare was increased.,30
NA,The Opposition wanted to slash $10 billion,30
NA,from social welfare payments. That is an,30
NA,absolute disgrace and exposes the hypocrisy,30
NA,of every member of the Opposition taking,30
NA,part in this debate. The honourable member,30
NA,for O'Connor ( Mr Tuckey) came up with this,30
NA,idea of a wealth tax. Talk about drawing a,30
NA,longbow-,30
NA,Mr Sciacca-And ducks.,30
Mr GIBSON,"Yes, maybe he was going",30
NA,to use the longbow to shoot down the ducks.,30
NA,It is absolute poppycock to consider that this,30
NA,is some sort of conspiracy to introduce a,30
NA,"wealth tax, and the honourable member for",30
NA,O'Connor knows that. We had other furphies,30
NA,introduced by the honourable member for,31
NA,"Berowra ( Mr Ruddock). On the one hand, he",31
NA,talked about all these pensioners who will be,31
NA,"badly affected, how much money they will",31
NA,"lose and how unfair it is. On the other hand,",31
NA,he says that the Government will not make,31
NA,the savings anyway. If as a result of this,31
NA,measure we are to affect the pensions of all,31
NA,"these people, how is it that we are not making",31
NA,the savings? That conflict has not been,31
NA,explained. I would be interested to find out,31
NA,how those two conflicting positions can be,31
NA,reconciled. The savings-modest as they,31
NA,"are-will be realised, as they have been with",31
NA,every other targeted measure. The Opposition,31
NA,knows that.,31
NA,Let us not forget why we are making those,31
NA,savings and the purpose that the savings are,31
NA,being put to. It was announced in the Budget,31
NA,that the Government was to extend fringe,31
NA,"benefits to part-pensioners, and that measure",31
NA,has been introduced. In looking at the ques-,31
NA,tion of the fairness and the operation of assets,31
NA,that some pensioners have in the form of,31
NA,shares and bringing them into line with other,31
NA,treatments that we have now for other forms,31
NA,"of investment that pensioners have, the sav-",31
NA,ings that we are introducing for a small,31
NA,number of pensioners in this area will now be,31
NA,utilised to benefit a whole host of additional,31
NA,people who will now be eligible for fringe,31
NA,benefits through the part-pension system.,31
NA,So the savings that we make from this,31
NA,small segment of the pensioner community,31
NA,are then being used to benefit a whole host of,31
NA,additional people in our social welfare net. I,31
NA,think that is a very important point that needs,31
NA,to be realised. The savings that we make here,31
NA,are not just going back into Consolidated,31
NA,Revenue; they are being utilised by the,31
NA,Government to extend additional benefits to,31
NA,other people.,31
NA,I assure the Opposition that the many,31
NA,"thousands of part-pensioners, who are now",31
NA,receiving the services through the health-care,31
NA,card and the other fringe benefits provided by,31
NA,"the Commonwealth, are very much apprecia-",31
NA,tive of that fact. What we have got here is an,31
NA,Opposition measure designed to take that,31
NA,away. The Opposition has not explained what,31
NA,it would do. If we lose this income how do,31
NA,we then pay for some of those other benefits?,31
NA,Does the Opposition intend to talk to all the,31
NA,part-pensioners in the electorate of Moreton,31
NA,and elsewhere around this country and ex-,31
NA,"plain, 'Sorry, we had to take the health care",31
NA,card off you. We had to take all these other,31
NA,benefits off you because three per cent of,31
NA,pensioners who earned some extra income,31
NA,through shares were not prepared to pay their,31
NA,way in relation to having that income recog-,31
NA,nised.',31
NA,Mr Sciacca-Because they wanted to play,31
NA,politics.,31
Mr GIBSON,"That is right, because the",31
NA,Opposition wanted to play politics in this,31
NA,issue. It wanted to change and take a new,31
NA,position on this after the election when it,31
NA,realised that the pensioner community in this,31
NA,country had abandoned the Opposition in the,31
NA,election campaign.,31
NA,We have also had the other furphy intro-,31
NA,"duced in this debate, 'Oh, here we have one",31
NA,more broken promise by the Government'.,31
NA,Let us not forget when this measure was,31
NA,introduced by the Government. It was an-,31
NA,nounced in the Budget and was introduced in,31
NA,legislation in this House in November or,31
NA,December last year. So the people of Austral-,31
NA,"ia, when they went to the polls on 13 March,",31
NA,knew exactly what they were voting for. This,31
NA,was part of the policy platform of the Govem-,31
NA,ment. They knew what they wanted and we,31
NA,got increased support from the aged com-,31
NA,munity around this country. That is the,31
NA,reality.,31
NA,This was part of our platform when we,31
NA,"went to the election, and the people of Aus-",31
NA,tralia supported it because they recognised,31
NA,that it was a fundamental part of our social,31
NA,justice objective to better target our social,31
NA,security payments and to make sure that it,31
NA,was a fair and equitable system. They knew,31
NA,that we were the ones that would introduce,31
NA,.that. They also knew that what the Opposition,31
NA,would do would have a massive impact on,31
NA,their income and their living standards by,31
NA,slashing so much money off social welfare-,31
NA,some $10 billion. So let us not talk about,31
NA,broken promises. We went to the people of,31
NA,this country telling them clearly what we were,31
NA,going to do and they reelected us with an,32
NA,increased majority. So do not tell us that this,32
NA,is some fonn of broken promise. The second,32
NA,thing is that the savings -e are making here,32
NA,are implementing another promise that we,32
NA,made and that is to introduce the fringe,32
NA,benefits to all part-pensioners. (1ime expired),32
Mr TRUSS ,Wide Bay) (11.34 a.m.)-The,32
NA,"Government likes to use words like 'fairness',",32
NA,'justice' and 'equity' to justify its policy,32
NA,"development. Indeed, we have heard those",32
NA,sorts of words used by the Parliamentary,32
NA,Secretary to the Minister for Social Security,32
NA,( Mr Sciacca) and by government members in,32
NA,defence of this quite unjustifiable action,32
NA,part in including unrealised capital gain on,32
NA,shares in the income test for social security,32
NA,purposes.,32
NA,This proposal is not fair. It treats shares,32
NA,a different way from almost all other assets.,32
NA,It treats shares differently from the family,32
NA,"home, antique clocks, the boat in the back-",32
NA,"yard, art works, racehorses, a stamp collection",32
NA,and property. It is therefore not fair.,32
NA,It is picking out one fonn of asset and,32
NA,treating it differently from other assets.,32
NA,"Indeed, the proposal is not even treating all",32
NA,shares in the same way. Listed shares are to,32
NA,be included in this income test but not unlist-,32
NA,"ed shares, so there is no equity and no justice.",32
NA,The Government frequently refers to align-,32
NA,ing the treatment of shares with managed,32
NA,"investment and equity trusts, but there is a",32
NA,vast difference between the way in which,32
NA,managed investments and equity trusts operate,32
NA,"compared with shares. Indeed, the honourable",32
NA,member for MCEwen ( Mr Cleeland) referred,32
NA,to the most fundamental of those differences,32
NA,"in his own defence of this action: that is, the",32
NA,ability for people to buy and sell shares at,32
NA,will. The freedom to move in and out of,32
NA,managed investment and equity trusts does,32
NA,"not exist in that way, so there is a vast differher",32
NA,ence in those particular styles of investment.,32
NA,They do not have the flexibility that exists,32
NA,with shares.,32
NA,"In a letter to me only last month, the Parliain",32
NA,mentary Secretary said that 'unrealised capital,32
NA,gain on shares reduces the real need of the,32
NA,person for social security assistance'. That is,32
NA,"absolute nonsense. Unrealised gain, unrealised",32
NA,"income, is of absolutely no value in protecting",32
NA,a person from the need for social security,32
NA,assistance. It does not buy bread; it does not,32
NA,pay rent; it does not meet the daily expenses.,32
NA,Income is worth while only when it is real-,32
NA,ised. When it is realised it is included-and,32
NA,rightly so-in the income test when the shares,32
NA,are sold. When there has been an increase in,32
NA,"the value of the shares, the assets test increas-",32
NA,es. That is perfectly fair. It is quite reasonable,32
NA,to include capital gain in asset tests; it is,32
NA,totally unreasonable to include unreallsed gain,32
NA,"in the income tests. Unearned, non-existent",32
NA,income is being treated as though it were,32
NA,on its actually there and able to be used to buy,32
NA,"bread, food and clothing when, in reality, it",32
NA,is not there.,32
NA,The Government is introducing this measure,32
NA,in in a totally unfair way. It is assuming that all,32
NA,shares have an opening value. That value has,32
NA,been assessed as at September 1992. The,32
NA,Government knows that share values were at,32
NA,"a historically low level at that time, so pen-",32
NA,sioners are going to be accused of having a,32
NA,capital gain on shares when in fact the value,32
NA,of those shares may well be lower than the,32
NA,purchase price. The Government is assuming,32
NA,"that pensioners have had a gain, that the",32
NA,"shares have earned money, when in fact they",32
NA,are worth less than was paid for thel!'.,32
NA,Let me relate to honourable members an,32
NA,example of a constituent of mine who inherit-,32
NA,ed some Coles Myer shares. Those shares are,32
NA,"of great personal value to her, largely in the",32
NA,same way that some people regard their stamp,32
NA,collections as having a great deal of sentimen-,32
NA,tal value. She acquired these shares from her,32
NA,"grandfather, whose company was one of those",32
NA,swallowed up in the development of the Coles,32
NA,Myer empire. She has no intention or wish,32
NA,ever to sell the shares. She wants to pass,32
NA,them through the family as a recognition of,32
NA,grandfather'S business. She will no longer,32
NA,be able to keep those shares and retain her,32
NA,"pension, because the gain on those inherited",32
NA,shares is going to be assessed and will result,32
NA,a loss of income for her from her pension.,32
NA,That is the kind of measure that this Govern-,32
NA,ment considers fair. It is all right to collect,32
NA,"clocks, stamps, boats, et cetera, as that sort of",32
NA,capital gain will not be taken into account.,32
NA,But people who happen to inherit shares will,33
NA,lose their pension.,33
NA,People can own multi-million dollar houses,33
NA,on the North Shore of Sydney gaining enor-,33
NA,"mously in capital value each year, and it will",33
NA,"not affect their pension, but people who dare",33
NA,have a modest share portfolio are going to,33
NA,have their pension reduced. The Government,33
NA,also likes to boast about the value of its,33
NA,"deeming provisions, which it claims have",33
NA,helped to increase pensioners' income-,33
NA,Mr Sciacca-They have.,33
Mr TRUSS,I notice that the Parliamen-,33
NA,tary Secretary is· nodding. He is therefore,33
NA,"putting his head in the noose, because he is",33
NA,now introducing a measure which will force,33
NA,pensioners to reduce their income. To satisfy,33
NA,"the Government, they will have to sell their",33
NA,"shares, which are earning perhaps six, eight,",33
NA,"or 10 per cent, and put the money somewhere",33
NA,where it will earn four per cent. That is the,33
NA,kind of measure the Government is proposing,33
NA,to put in place.,33
NA,Is the Parliamentary Secretary suggesting,33
NA,that pensioners are just going to sit there,33
NA,allow their income to be reduced when there,33
NA,are measures that they can undertake to lower,33
NA,their income artificially and therefore qualify,33
NA,for a higher pension? The sort of measure the,33
NA,Government is proposing to introduce demon-,33
NA,strates total inconsistency. Of course if pen-,33
NA,"sioners go out and sell their shares, they will",33
NA,have to pay capital gains tax on them as well,33
NA,if those shares were purchased after Septem-,33
NA,ber of 1985.,33
NA,The Government claims that a pensioner,33
NA,"rort has been going on, and that pensioners",33
NA,have been using capital gains on shares to,33
NA,avoid the income test. The Government thinks,33
NA,that as a result of stopping this rort $60,33
NA,million will be saved-although the figure has,33
NA,now been raised to $80 million. I am amused,33
NA,by the Parliamentary Secretary again claiming,33
NA,he has all these detailed mathematical calcula-,33
NA,tions so he can guarantee that he can deliver,33
NA,these savings to the Government. If they are,33
NA,"so detailed, why does he keep changing the",33
NA,numbers? When this Bill was introduced back,33
NA,"in November 60,000 people were going to be",33
NA,affected. The Minister for Social Security ( Mr,33
NA,"Baldwin) issued a press release on 6 May,",33
NA,"putting the number of 84,000. The Minister",33
NA,"now has it at 107,000. It is about time they",33
NA,made up their mind if those numbers are,33
NA,supposed to have been so accurately calculat-,33
NA,ed.,33
NA,The Government has not taken into account,33
NA,in its numbers the reaction of pensioners to,33
NA,these new measures. Clearly pensioners will,33
NA,alter their patterns of investment. They will,33
NA,change their arrangements so that the alleged,33
NA,"savings will, in reality, not exist. Another fact",33
NA,that has to be taken into account is that if the,33
NA,"value of pensioners' shares drop, they may",33
NA,become eligible for a pension that they are,33
NA,"not currently able to receive. Indeed, had this",33
NA,measure been introduced about three years,33
NA,"ago and not today, it would have cost the",33
NA,Government money every year rather than,33
NA,achieved any savings. Clearly there will be,33
NA,"occasions in the future, too, when this meas-",33
NA,ure will end up being a liability for the,33
NA,Government. That will occur in those years,33
NA,"when share values drop, and as a result the",33
NA,Government's own income will have dropped.,33
NA,This measure is clearly a very poor example,33
NA,and of risk management. The Government will,33
NA,have increased liabilities in times when the,33
NA,value of pensioners' shares drops and when,33
NA,they will therefore start to apply for higher,33
NA,pensions. That will occur at times when the,33
NA,Government can ill afford it.,33
NA,The honourable member for Moreton ( Mr,33
NA,"Gibson), .in his defence of this system, ac-",33
NA,knowledged that savings would be minimal.,33
NA,"The Speaker, in his comments on this meas-",33
NA,"ure, indicated that it was impossible to ascer-",33
NA,tain whether there would actually be any,33
NA,savings at all or whether there would be,33
NA,"liabilities for the Government. So, clearly,",33
NA,independent observers and the Government's,33
NA,own speakers have acknowledged that the,33
NA,"savings are likely to be negligible, if they",33
NA,exist at all.,33
NA,The Government's measures are being,33
NA,"introduced with only one thought in mind,",33
NA,and that is to spitefully treat those pensioners,33
NA,who have put aside during their working days,33
NA,for their own retirement. I thought we should,33
NA,be encouraging people to provide for their,33
NA,own retirement. This Government gives lip,33
NA,service to that principle with its compulsory,33
NA,"superannuation arrangements. But, in reality,",34
NA,when pensioners actually take such measures,34
NA,on their own account and buy shares so they,34
NA,will have something to live on in their retire-,34
NA,"ment, this Government is introducing meas-",34
NA,ures which will penalise those people. It is,34
NA,"encouraging welfare dependency, a reliance",34
NA,"on the Government and taxpayers, rather than",34
NA,rewarding those who make the extra effort to,34
NA,care for themselves. (TIme expired),34
Mr SCIACCA ,Bowman-Parliamentary,34
NA,Secretary to the Minister for Social Security),34
NA,(11.44 a.m.)-The honourable member for,34
NA,Wide Bay (Me Truss) clearly does not under-,34
NA,"stand what is going on here, with respect.",34
NA,These measures were announced in the Budg-,34
NA,et of 1992. He is putting up the proposition,34
NA,that somehow the Government knew that the,34
NA,stock market was going to go up and that we,34
NA,particularly sought September 1993 as the,34
NA,implementation date for these measures,34
NA,because all of a sudden there has been an,34
NA,increase in the stock market. I remind him,34
NA,that this decision was made in the Budget,34
NA,"process of August 1992, and the date in terms",34
NA,of the treatment of the value of the shares in,34
NA,this measure was fixed at September 1993. If,34
NA,he is trying to suggest that the Government,34
NA,somehow knew that there would be an in-,34
NA,"crease in the stock market during that period,",34
NA,I wish I had known that myself.,34
NA,The fact is that no-one knows how the,34
NA,stock market is going to go. At the moment,34
NA,it is in a profit situation but the stock market,34
NA,"is such that people, if they want to, can divest",34
NA,"themselves of some of their shares, but not all",34
NA,of them. They would have to do that if they,34
NA,"had property, collectables or antiques. They",34
NA,would have to sell the whole of the invest-,34
NA,ment. With shares they only need a portion of,34
NA,their investment and they can readily sell,34
NA,shares on the stock market from day to day.,34
NA,So it is not comparing oranges with oranges,34
NA,"to say that a collectable, a property or an",34
NA,antique clock is the same as shares. It is a,34
NA,nonsense to suggest that.,34
NA,As the honourable for MCEwen ( Mr,34
NA,"Cleeland) said before, the Opposition is",34
NA,simply making politics out of this issue. If,34
NA,those opposite go out into the electorate at,34
NA,"large, there will be 400 people spread across",34
NA,the electorate who would say that we are,34
NA,being tough. I will comment further about that,34
NA,"later, but people have had a very long time to",34
NA,decide what they will do. This legislation is,34
NA,not a Trojan horse. The Government went to,34
NA,the public in March and the public knew what,34
NA,the proposal was. An investor who is astute,34
NA,enough to want to buy shares and have large,34
NA,shareholdings does not do it off his or her,34
NA,own back; that investor would go to financial,34
NA,planners and investment advisers. If it is,34
NA,being suggested that investment advisers did,34
NA,"not know of these provisions, then they are",34
NA,not much good and I suggest that people,34
NA,should not be going to them.,34
Mr CAMERON ,Stirling) (11.46 a.m.)-,34
NA,"Exactly a week ago today, with my colleagues",34
NA,the honourable member for Cowan ( Mr,34
NA,Evans) and the honourable member for Moore,34
NA,"(Me Filing), I met with a very large group of",34
NA,pensioners in Western Australia. A large,34
NA,section of that group. were self-funded retirees,34
NA,and if there was ever a disincentive for,34
NA,younger Australians to take out provision for,34
NA,their retirement it would be this Government's,34
NA,"handling of the self-funded retirees, many of",34
NA,whom are affected by what we are talking,34
NA,about here today. .,34
NA,At present pensioners receive dividends,34
NA,from the shares they own and these dividends,34
NA,are regarded as income earned by the pension-,34
NA,er. Any growth in the value of shares was,34
NA,previously regarded as an increase in one's,34
NA,"assets. However, the changes made by the",34
NA,Government last year regard growth in the,34
NA,value of shares as increased income for the,34
NA,purposes of working out one's pension entitle-,34
NA,ments.,34
NA,When this was first brought to my attention,34
NA,I thought I was being had. I could not believe,34
NA,"it. I said, 'No, I think you have misunderstood",34
NA,"what they are on about'. Unfortunately, I was",34
NA,"wrong. This legislation, in essence, distin-",34
NA,guishes pensioners from all other groups with,34
NA,"regard to the holding of shares. If, for exam-",34
NA,"ple, the Prime Minister (Me Keating) held",34
NA,"shares in a piggery company, he would be",34
NA,taxed on any dividends he received from that,34
NA,"company. However, if the value of the shares",34
NA,rose he would not be penalised in any other,34
NA,"way until he sold them, when he would of",35
NA,course be liable for capital gains tax.,35
NA,"The situation therefore arises where, for",35
NA,"every $1 increase in the value of shares,",35
NA,pensioners will lose 57.5c of their existing,35
NA,age pension. This is despite the fact that the,35
NA,shares have not been sold and the pensioners,35
NA,have not actually received any increase in,35
NA,their income. If honourable members think for,35
NA,one moment that people will hold on to these,35
NA,"shares, they can think again. It was stated to",35
NA,me quite categorically at the meeting last,35
NA,"week that they would be selling their shares,",35
NA,because they are embattled enough as it is,35
NA,trying to get by under the treatment that has,35
NA,"been meted out to them, and this was just",35
NA,another brick in the wall.,35
NA,"Essentially, this legislation ignores",35
NA,flow for pensioners which is so important to,35
NA,consider. Many pensioners will be left out of,35
NA,pocket because the shares they own will have,35
NA,increased in value. While they would not have,35
NA,"received any extra income, they will lose part",35
NA,"of their pension because, of course, it is",35
NA,assumed that their income has increased.,35
NA,There are a lot of assumptions going on.,35
NA,This has a vicious cycle effect in that,35
NA,pensioners who have their pensions reduced,35
NA,will eventually be forced to sell their shares-,35
NA,as they surely will-and this will subsequent-,35
NA,ly mean that they will be forced to pay capital,35
NA,gains tax. Eventually the pensioners will,35
NA,spend the funds they have accumulated from,35
NA,selling their shares and be forced to go back,35
NA,"on the full pension, resulting in any expected",35
NA,savings by the Government being wiped out.,35
NA,There will be no windfall; you can bet on,35
NA,that.,35
NA,I was reading the May edition of Personal,35
NA,"Investment magazine, not only to gloat over",35
NA,the story about the former member for Stirling,35
NA,losing his seat but also to read its analysis of,35
NA,the Government's idea to treat unrealised,35
NA,capital gains as income. The story mentions,35
NA,Bleakleys The Investment Planners and that,35
NA,firm's suggestion to pensioners to 'sell their,35
NA,shares and take gains prior to 23 September,35
NA,1993'.,35
NA,"While this is the best option for pensioners,",35
NA,"for many it is not the desired option, as we",35
NA,have heard in some convincing argument from,35
NA,"this side of the chamber. Unfortunately, it is",35
NA,the only option for pensioners and it is unfor-,35
NA,tunate that they are left with little choice but,35
NA,to sell their shares. I would like to mention a,35
NA,"pensioner in my electorate, a gentleman",35
NA,named Bill. He has owned shares for some 30,35
NA,years. Based on the price of shares a few,35
NA,weeks ago and the price of those same shares,35
NA,"in September last year, Bill has worked out",35
NA,that his pension will be cut by approximately,35
NA,$140 a week. While the actual value of the,35
NA,"shares rose, Bill's income would not have",35
NA,"increased at all, but he will still be penal-",35
NA,ised-and a significant penalty that will be.,35
NA,He has very few choices other than to give,35
NA,"the shares to his children, sell them or accept",35
NA,"a lower pension-and, at $140 per week less",35
NA,"than what he normally earns, I cannot imagine",35
NA,the cash that that would be a viable option.,35
NA,I also put questions on notice to both the,35
NA,Treasurer ( Mr Dawkins) and the Minister for,35
NA,"Social Security ( Mr Baldwin), neither of",35
NA,whom has yet answered these questions-but,35
NA,I have already been warned that Ministers do,35
NA,take a great deal of time to answer their,35
NA,"questions, which does make it difficult for",35
NA,"one to assist constituents. Nevertheless, I put",35
NA,the case to both Ministers of a pensioner and,35
NA,a PAYE taxpayer who both own the same,35
NA,shares. The question in essence asked what,35
NA,effect fluctuations in shares would have on,35
NA,both if they bought those shares in 1990 for,35
NA,"$5, the shares fell in value to $3 on 23 Sep-",35
NA,tember 1992 and rose to $4 one year later.,35
NA,The answer I expected-and that I imagine is,35
NA,"correct-is that, while a taxpayer would not",35
NA,"be penalised, the pensioner would lose part of",35
NA,his pension due to the increase in value over,35
NA,"the past year even though, firstly, he has not",35
NA,"sold his shares and, secondly, if he did sell",35
NA,"his shares, he would have made a loss.",35
NA,"In this situation, the pensioner is hit with a",35
NA,double whammy. If he or she receives any,35
NA,"dividend, it is treated as income. I cannot say",35
NA,for sure but I also assume-seeing that there,35
NA,are a lot of assumptions going on-that the,35
NA,dividend imputation credits would also artifi-,35
NA,cially increase that income and therefore,35
NA,further reduce the pension the person is,35
NA,entitled to. If the value of the shares rises,35
NA,"over the year, the pensioner loses part of his",35
NA,"or her pension and, finally, if the pensioner",36
NA,"sells the shares for a profit, he or she pays",36
NA,capital gains tax.,36
NA,This is harsher than if a PAYE taxpayer,36
NA,owned shares. The PAYE taxpayer does not,36
NA,get penalised for any unrealised capital gains,36
NA,and nor should he; neither should a pensioner.,36
NA,"I assume that, if these amendments are not",36
NA,"accepted, many pensioners will sell their",36
NA,shares and invest in real estate or other items,36
NA,which do not penalise them if their value,36
NA,"increases. Unfortunately, this may have a",36
NA,detrimental effect on investment by individu-,36
NA,als at a time when we certainly do not need,36
NA,such disincentives for investment.,36
NA,I will conclude by reiterating that this is,36
NA,unfair legislation which deserves to be re-,36
NA,"pealed. It lacks compassion, it defies logic, it Melham, D.",36
NA,is unnecessary and it will achieve absolutely,36
NA,zilch in the long term. I would encourage all,36
NA,"members, including those opposite, to support",36
NA,these amendments to ensure the pensioners in,36
NA,our electorates are not treated unfairly. I,36
NA,challenge any honourable members opposite,36
NA,who oppose these amendments to write to the,36
NA,pensioners in their electorates telling them,36
NA,why they should be penalised if the shares,36
NA,they own rise in price-even if they do not,36
NA,sell their shares. It is a challenge that I am,36
NA,"quite sure that none will accept, including-",36
NA,and probably especially-the honourable,36
NA,"member for MCEwen ( Mr Cleeland), who",36
NA,"perhaps has lost his calling, because he is",36
NA,quite an amusing speaker and does a great,36
NA,"duck impression, albeit it unintentionally. In",36
NA,"view of all that, I would urge Government",36

NA,Question so resolved in the afflnnative.,37
NA,Resolution reported.,37
NA,Adoption of Report,37
NA,Motion (by Mr Sciacca) proposed:,37
NA,That the report be adopted.,37
Mr BRADFORD ,MCPherson) (12.12,37
NA,p.m.)-I wish to oppose the adoption of this,37
NA,report. The Social Security Amendment Bill,37
NA,is an absolute disgrace. I do not know what,37
NA,it would take to convince the Government,37
NA,that what it is doing to pensioners as a result,37
NA,of this legislation is disgraceful. The Parlia-,37
NA,mentary Secretary to the Minister for Social,38
NA,Security ( Mr Sciacca) has sat there through,38
NA,"speaker after speaker and listened, I think,",38
NA,"reason, yet he has failed to accept our argu-",38
NA,ments. I do not know why. He has not ex-,38
NA,plained in any cogent form why we should,38
NA,proceed with this legislation.,38
NA,The honourable member for Moreton ( Mr,38
NA,"Gibson), when he was speaking in this debate,",38
NA,talked about better targeting of welfare. That,38
NA,has really hit the bullseye here. This is aimed,38
NA,directly at the heart of pensioners. Those,38
NA,"86,000 or so pensioners of this country who",38
NA,have share portfolios are very concerned. We,38
NA,have been accused this morning of s<;>mething,38
NA,"of a beat-up in expressing our concern, but I",38
NA,want to assure the House that this is not a,38
NA,beat-up. We are speaking here because pen-,38
NA,sioners all over Australia have made their,38
NA,concerns known to us. They are very con-,38
NA,"cerned. The speakers in this debate, which the",38
NA,Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for,38
NA,"Social Security gagged a moment ago, I",38
NA,believe have been totally genuine in express-,38
NA,ing the concerns of pensioners everywhere.,38
NA,The Parliamentary Secretary's arguments in,38
NA,favour of the proposition that unrealised,38
NA,capital gains on pensioners' share portfolios,38
NA,be taxed have been pathetic. The arguments,38
NA,that he has put forward are gross distortions.,38
NA,I thought this Government was big on anti-,38
NA,discrimination and big on fairness and equity.,38
NA,I want the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me,38
NA,what is fair about taxing unrealised capital,38
NA,"gains. In any sense, what is fair about taxing",38
NA,"unrealised capital·gains? Why, if the Govern-",38
NA,"ment is to tax unrealised capital gains, does",38
NA,it discriminate against pensioners? Why has,38
NA,it chosen only to tax unrealised capital gains,38
NA,on pensioners' shares? What is fair about,38
NA,that? That is discrimination. Our concern,38
NA,about this legislation is that it is blatantly,38
NA,unfair. Speaker after speaker has illustrated,38
NA,the effect of the Government's proposal. If,38
NA,"that has not sunk in yet, I do not know what",38
NA,it will take for it to sink in. I have put the,38
NA,question on a number of occasions when this,38
NA,matter has been discussed here: how does the,38
NA,pensioner who loses his pension as a result of,38
NA,this mechanism live?,38
NA,Mr Sciacca-Sell some of their shares.,38
Mr BRADFORD,"Yes, he sells some of",38
NA,his shares; that is the very point that we are,38
NA,to making. I thank the honourable member for,38
NA,helping me to make it. The point is that the,38
NA,intention of the Government in this matter is,38
NA,"to ensure that 86,000 pensioners in this",38
NA,country who have share portfolios will sell,38
NA,them or sell part of them.,38
NA,At least we have come to the point in this,38
NA,debate where the Government is prepared to,38
NA,be honest about that. All morning members of,38
NA,the Government have been getting up and,38
NA,distorting the truth. The Government's inten-,38
NA,tion is for pensioners not to have the privilege,38
NA,of owning shares-a privilege which is,38
NA,enjoyed by every other Australian. That is the,38
NA,Government's intention and that will be the,38
NA,effect of the amendment. The reason that will,38
NA,"be the effect of it, let me assure the House, is",38
NA,the same reason we are putting forward-,38
NA,Motion (by Mr Beazley) put:,38

Mr SCIACCA ,Bowman-Parliamentary,39
NA,Secretary to the Minister for Social Security),39
NA,(12.28 p.m.)-On behalf of the committee,39
NA,appointed to draw up reasons for the House,39
NA,"disagreeing to the amendment of the Senate,",39
NA,"I present the reasons, which are being circu-",39
NA,lated to honourable members.,39
NA,The reasons read as follows-,39
NA,Senate amendment No. 1 is not acceptable,39
NA,because:,39
NA,1. It excludes shares and other listed securities,39
NA,from the definition of investment product in,39
NA,the Social Security Act and thereby prevents,39
NA,the equitable assessment of the ongoing gains,39
NA,made on shares and other investments listed on,39
NA,the Stock Exchange compared with indirect,39
NA,investments in shares through equity trusts.,39
NA,2. The amendment will reduce the equity of the,39
NA,social security income test. The assessment of,39
NA,ongoing capital gains on shares ensures that,39
NA,equity of the social security system is en-,39
NA,hanced. Pensioners with the same means and,39
NA,the same financial resources available to them,39
NA,should have the same amount of income,39
NA,assessed for social security purposes. People,39
NA,who invest in shares should not be treated,39
NA,more beneficially than those who invest in,39
NA,"equity trusts or other managed investments,",39
NA,and they should not be treated more beneficial-,39
NA,ly than those pensioners who invest in income,39
NA,generating investments such as bank accounts.,39
NA,3. The amendment would result in the expendi-,39
NA,ture of approximately $60 million within the,39
NA,Social Security portfolio in a full year and a,39
NA,further $20 million for a full year within the,39
NA,Department of Veterans' Affairs portfolio on,39
NA,a group of clients with substantial financial,39
NA,resources.,39
NA,PAIRS 4. There is no reason why shares should be,39
NA,excluded and given privileged treatment. It is,39
NA,a principle of the social security income test,39
NA,that ongoing gains are treated as income for,39
NA,all investments that can be readily realised and,39
NA,utilised by pensioners for their support. Only,39
NA,those investments which are not readily reali-,39
NA,"sable, such as real estate and shares held in",39
NA,private companies are currently exempt. Listed,39
NA,shares can be sold in small or large bundles at,39
NA,any time allowing gains on listed shares to be,39
NA,readily utilised by a pensioner.,39
NA,Motion (by Mr Sciacca) proposed:,39
NA,That the Committee's reasons be adopted.,39
NA,Mr DEPU TY SPEAKER-The question,40
NA,is that the motion be agreed to.,40
NA,"Mr Ruddock - Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise",40
NA,a point of order. I have not had a chance to,40
NA,read them yet. I think that honourable mem-,40

NA,because the matters contained in it are exactly,41
NA,"the same as those which we just debated,",41
NA,"namely, the change in the treatment of shares,",41
NA,which was made law as and from December,41
NA,1992. For all the reasons that we have already,41
NA,discussed and to save the time of the cham-,41
NA,"ber, I wi11leave my remarks at that.",41
Mr TIM FISCHER ,Farrer-Leader of the,41
NA,National Party of Australia) (12.42 p.m.)-I,41
NA,rise to speak briefly to the Veterans' Affairs,41
NA,Legislation Amendment Bill and the Senate,41
NA,"amendment thereto. Interestingly enough, the",41
NA,Bill contains the original provisions contained,41
NA,"when the House debated it last, including",41
NA,extension of benefits to the peacekeeping,41
NA,forces in Cambodia and Yugoslavia and,41
NA,"adjustments to, the assets test and the like. It",41
NA,now has attached to it an excellent proposi-,41
NA,tion which effectively moves to end the,41
NA,Government's introduction of notional capital,41
NA,gains tax on pensioners.,41
NA,Much has been said about capital gains tax,41
NA,during the debate on the related Social Securi-,41
NA,ty Amendment Bill. Let me make two addi-,41
NA,"tional points only. Firstly, the Government's",41
NA,approach is a tip of the iceberg approach. It,41
NA,is a stab at the whole concept of notional,41
NA,capital gains tax once proposed by the British,41
NA,Labour Party and variously proposed by the,41
NA,Australian Labor Party in one form or an-,41
NA,other. That tip of the iceberg approach will,41
NA,"flow on, if the Government gets away with it,",41
NA,to other areas of statute to the disadvantage of,41
NA,good tax law in Australia and what is a fair,41
NA,go in terms of business not actually gaining,41
NA,the gain but still being subjected to a fonn of,41
NA,notional capital gains tax. I believe that,41
NA,concept is absolutely repugnant.,41
NA,"Secondly, to think that pensioners, including",41
NA,"veteran service pensioners, will somehow go",41
NA,20 scot-free if they hold shares is incorrect. I say,41
NA,to the Minister for Social Security ( Mr,41
NA,Baldwin) and to the Parliamentary Secretary,41
NA,to the Minister for Social Security ( Mr,41
NA,Sciacca): the Government already has on the,41
NA,statute books its basic assets test legislation.,41
NA,It already has on the statute books the income,41
NA,"test provisions, so that pensioners with a",41
NA,portfolio-and good luck to them if they find,41
NA,shares paying a sufficient dividend to trigger,41
NA,the income threshold-will be clobbered in,41
NA,terms of the service pension. It already has on,41
NA,the statute books the capital gains tax provi-,42
NA,"sions, which means that if pensioners actually",42
NA,"trade in shares, their service or age pension",42
NA,will be adjusted.,42
NA,I want to say to the House in very clear-cut,42
NA,terms that the pensioner is already catered,42
NA,Those pensioners holding shares-and they,42
NA,are entitled to hold shares-who have fought,42
NA,for their country are now service pensioners.,42
NA,They might hold some shares in a range of,42
NA,stocks. We are about protecting their right to,42
NA,hold those shares and not be subjected to,42
NA,"notional capital gains tax, that is, a notional",42
NA,adjustment leading to the circumstance where,42
NA,their pension would be reduced-and that is,42
NA,what notional capital gains tax is. It is for,42
NA,these reasons that I support the Senate's,42
NA,amendment to the Bill now being considered,42
NA,by the Committee of the Whole.,42
Mr RUDDOCK ,Berowra) (12.45 p.m.)-I,42
NA,want to take a couple of moments to add to,42
NA,some of the points raised on the Senate,42
NA,amendment to the Veterans' Affairs Legisla-,42
NA,tion Amendment Bill. It is important to,42
NA,recognise that gains on shares can sometimes,42
NA,be illusory and based on short-tenn and,42
NA,extraneous matters rather than underlying,42
NA,value. One of the problems we have with this,42
NA,Government's proposal is that it singles out,42
NA,those service pensioners who seek to preserve,42
NA,"their capital in the fonn of shares, as distinct",42
NA,"from other forms of investment, such as real",42
NA,"estate and other properties. In fact, it moves",42
NA,"the test which at the moment excludes shares,",42
NA,to one that now enables-,42

Mr KEATING ,Blaxland-Prime Minister),42

NA,"Resources and Tourism, Mr Lee, will be",42
NA,absent from Question Time today.,42
NA,"Opposition members-Ha, hal",42

Dr HEWSON ,The start of an impeccable,42

Mr KEATING,It is terrific that you are,42

NA,STANDING ORDER 145,42
Mr SPEAKER,During my very first,42
NA,question period as Speaker on 5 May 1993,42
NA,the matter of standing order 145 in respect of,42
NA,the relevance of an answer to a question,42
NA,without notice was raised. It had been raised,42
NA,frequently during the previous Parliament. On,42
NA,10 May I was asked questions by both the,42
NA,honourable members for Moncrieff and Curtin,42
NA,on the same issue and indicated that I would,42
NA,be considering the matter and making a,42
NA,statement to the House.,42
NA,Standing order 145 is the only standing,42
NA,order which deals specifically with an answer,42
NA,to a question without notice. It provides,42
NA,simply:,42
NA,An answer shall be relevant to the question.,42
NA,As indicated in House of Representatives,42
NA,"Practice, the Standing Orders and practice of",42
NA,the House have been criticised in that restric-,42
NA,tions similar to those applying to the fonn,42
NA,and content of questions do not apply to,42
NA,answers. Although it has been argued that the,42
NA,provision in standing order 144 which pro-,42
NA,vides that questions cannot be debated should,42
NA,be read as meaning a prohibition of debate in,42
NA,"answering, as well as in putting, a question,",42
NA,it has not been so interpreted by the Chair.,42
NA,House of Representatives Practice goes on,43
NA,to say that the latitude pennitted to Ministers,43
NA,has often been quite considerable in the,43
NA,House of Representatives. Speakers have,43
NA,"ruled consistently that, provided an answer is",43
NA,relevant and is not couched in unparliamen-,43
NA,"tary language, Ministers may answer ques-",43
NA,tions without notice in virtually any way they,43
NA,choose. The interpretation of 'relevant' has at,43
NA,times been very wide. In practice the word,43
NA,has been frequently accepted by the Chair as,43
NA,"meaning relevant in some way, or relevant in",43
NA,"part, rather than directly or completely rel-",43
NA,evant.,43
NA,House of Representatives Practice records,43
NA,that there have been occasions when Ministers,43
NA,have been asked to resume their seats as their,43
NA,answers have not been relevant. The Chair,43
NA,has also held that a Minister 'should not,43
NA,engage in irrelevancies' such as contrasting,43
NA,the Government and the Opposition. Past,43
NA,Speakers have directed a Minister so doing,43
NA,"not to proceed, although on many other",43
NA,occasions such comments have been permit-,43
NA,ted.,43
NA,"In view of the foregoing, I propose to allow",43
NA,references to subjects over which Ministers do,43
NA,not exercise direct control but which may,43
NA,impact upon their area of responsibility: for,43
NA,"example, comments on the foreign policy of",43
NA,"another nation, comments on the international",43
NA,"economic situation, and references to opposi-",43
NA,tion attitude where appropriate. The House,43
NA,itself could take some initiative in this matter.,43
NA,The Standing Committee on Procedure in,43
NA,both 1986 and 1992 made recommendations,43
NA,in respect of standing order 145. In 1992 the,43
NA,report recommended that the standing order,43
NA,should be amended to read:,43
NA,The answer to a question without notice:,43
NA,(a) shall be concise and confined to the subject,43
NA,matter of the question; and,43
NA,(b) shall not debate the subject to which the,43
NA,question refers.,43
NA,An answer to a question on notice shall be relevant,43
NA,"to the question"".",43
NA,Passage of this recommendation would con-,43
NA,fine answers to questions more than the,43
NA,practice I have enunciated and which I have,43
NA,indicated current Standing Orders effectively,43
NA,oblige me to pursue. In the absence of any,43
NA,"action, the Chair is left in the position that it",43
NA,has to be guided to a large extent by the,43
NA,practice that has developed in the House.,43
NA,"However, I have to say that I will be",43
NA,looking to Ministers to be more relevant than,43
NA,they have been on some occasions in the past.,43
NA,I would hope that the experience of the last,43
NA,"two sitting weeks, when an average of about",43
NA,"14 questions was asked each day, will con-",43
NA,"tinue. In this regard, I intend to adopt the",43
NA,"practice of earlier Speakers who, on a number",43
NA,"of occasions, invited Ministers to wind up",43
NA,"lengthy answers. By the same token, I would",43
NA,suggest that points of order and interjections,43
NA,do not encourage Ministers to wind up their,43
NA,"answers; on the contrary, they tend to prolong",43
NA,the answers.,43
NA,I have been aware of changing community,43
NA,"perceptions in relation to Question Time,",43
NA,particularly since it has been televised live.,43
NA,As citizens of Australia expect that Question,43
NA,Time will provide an insight into the current,43
NA,"issues facing the nation, I hope to facilitate",43
NA,that process and I seek the cooperation of all,43
NA,honourable members in attempting so to do.,43
NA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,43
NA,Income Tax Cuts,43
Mr DOWNER,I direct my question to the,43
NA,Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the,43
NA,"Government's Budget problems, which are",43
NA,"well known, and ask: will the Treasurer give",43
NA,a categorical assurance that the Government,43
NA,is still committed to providing the One Nation,43
NA,income tax cuts?,43
Mr DAWKINS,The Government has no,43
NA,intention of rescinding the provisions which,43
NA,were put in the tax scales last year. That was,43
NA,said at the time; I repeat it now.,43
NA,Budget Deficit,43
Mr SWAN,My question is directed to the,43
NA,Treasurer. Has the Treasurer's attention been,43
NA,drawn to media reports of calls for rapid and,43
NA,radical action to move the Budget towards,43
NA,surplus? Can the Treasurer infonn the House,43
NA,of practical differences between a rapid and,43
NA,radical approach and a medium-tenn ap-,43
NA,proach?,43
Mr DAWKINS,I have seen some discus-,43
NA,sion in the media about these apparently,43
NA,various calls for a rapid and radical series of,44
NA,actions to move the Budget towards surplus.,44
NA,I have also seen other reports embracing the,44
NA,Government's view that in repairing the,44
NA,Budget we should approach it on the basis of,44
NA,a medium-term strategy.,44
NA,I notice that most of the claims about the,44
NA,need for a rapid and radical approach have,44
NA,come either from the Opposition itself or from,44
NA,various of its diminishing cheer squad outside,44
NA,"this place-most particularly, the renowned",44
NA,Des Moore of the Institute of Public Affairs.,44
NA,"In fact, Des Moore seems to be about the",44
NA,only outside commentator who is proposing,44
NA,this rapid and radical approach. A number of,44
NA,"other professional economists, other commen-",44
NA,"tators, have actually said that it would be",44
NA,counterproductive for us to follow the pre-,44
NA,scriptions as proposed by Mr Moore and,44
NA,apparently sometimes embraced by the Oppo-,44
NA,sition. The reason is that to take this radical,44
NA,and rapid action would be counterproductive,44
NA,to the requirements of economic policy at the,44
NA,moment.,44
NA,The Government took a very deliberate,44
NA,"decision last year, both in the One Nation",44
NA,"context and in the Budget, to provide a fiscal",44
NA,stimulus in order to promote economic recov-,44
NA,ery in this country. That process is still,44
NA,place. It was always the Government's inten-,44
NA,"tion, as was spelled out on both of those",44
NA,"occasions, that following the economic stimu-",44
NA,lus provided by those measures it would be,44
NA,moving the deficit down to a point where it,44
NA,reached about one per cent of GDP by the,44
NA,1996-97 financial year.,44
NA,I have already said that the prospective,44
NA,deficit for next year could be as high as $18,44
NA,billion if no action were taken. I have also,44
NA,said that the deficit for next year should be,44
NA,around the level of that in prospect for this,44
NA,year. So what that means is that the Govern-,44
NA,ment is firmly fixed on that medium-term,44
NA,strategy-a strategy which has been embraced,44
NA,by people such as the Chief Economist for,44
NA,"Legal and General, Mr Jolly from Syntec and",44
NA,even Mr Truglia from Moodys.,44
NA,The process of going towards that medium-,44
NA,term objective will commence in this Budget,44
NA,round as the Government examines both,44
NA,expenditure reductions and the revenue side,44
NA,of the Budget in order to make a credible start,44
NA,on the achievement of that objective. It is,44
NA,important to understand that Opposition,44
NA,members do not have a clue about any of,44
NA,these issues. They are confused amongst,44
NA,"themselves and, indeed, even individual",44
NA,spokespersons for the Opposition are saying,44
NA,entirely contradictory things.,44
NA,I think the message from all this was,44
NA,perhaps best spelt out when the Leader of the,44
NA,"Opposition was asked whether, in making his",44
NA,"criticisms of the Government, he had some",44
NA,higher responsibility towards the national,44
NA,"interest. Of course, he denied that he did. He",44
NA,"said, 'We tried that and it failed'. So the",44
NA,Opposition is now firmly into the business of,44
NA,"irresponsible opposition, internally inconsis-",44
NA,tent opposition. It is clear from what the,44
NA,person asking this question has said in just,44
NA,the last few days. He said that we should cut,44
NA,expenditure on the one hand and increase,44
NA,expenditure on the other hand. Whilst propos-,44
NA,"ing those two measures, he is suggesting that",44
NA,the Opposition has its own candidates for,44
NA,increased expenditure. When asked how to,44
NA,reconcile this mess-,44
NA,"Mr Tim Fischer-On a point of order, Mr",44
NA,Speaker: you gave a lengthy ruling to the,44
NA,taking House at the commencement of Question,44
NA,Time which addresses the very dimension,44
NA,which the Treasurer is now proceeding to. My,44
NA,point of order that you invite him to sit down,44
NA,"is based on two counts: firstly, his lengthy",44
NA,reference to the Opposition's attitude and the,44
NA,"attitude of the Leader of the Opposition; and,",44
NA,"secondly, the length of his answer.",44
Mr SPEAKER,There is no point of order,44
NA,for the reason that the Treasurer was asked to,44
NA,respond to public comment regarding the,44
NA,"deficit. In my view, having listened very",44
NA,"carefully to what the Treasurer has said, he is",44
NA,illustrating that answer.,44
Mr DAWKINS,At the same time as the,44
NA,honourable member for Mayo was saying that,44
NA,the Government must proceed with all its,44
NA,"election undertakings, he said that we should",44
NA,be cutting expenditure. He invited attention,44
NA,towards the expenditure reductions which the,44
NA,Opposition had proposed in the election,44
NA,context. I ask the honourable member for,44
NA,Mayo: how many of these expenditure reduc-,44
NA,tions is he still committed to? Ish est i 11,45
NA,committed to a $50 million cut in the ABC,45
NA,budget? Is he still committed to a $160,45
NA,"million cut in the CES, as various members",45
NA,of the Opposition are wandering around,45
NA,shedding crocodile tears about unemploy-,45
NA,ment? Is he also proposing a cut of $1.5,45
NA,billion in Medicare or is the Opposition still,45
NA,to learn the lesson of the last election about,45
NA,the great attachment that the Australian,45
NA,people have to Medicare? Is he still keen on,45
NA,cutting $400 million from the Common-,45
NA,wealth-State housing agreement? Is he still,45
NA,interested in cutting $719 million from the,45
NA,"States, Territories and local government?",45
NA,still interested in cutting $115 million from,45
NA,sole parents? And is he still interested in,45
NA,cutting $152 million in order to force unem-,45
NA,ployed people to sell down all of their liquid,45
NA,assets before they are entitled to unemploy-,45
NA,ment benefits?,45
NA,Members of the Opposition have exposed,45
NA,their own position on this issue. They are into,45
NA,the business of totally irresponsible opposi-,45
NA,tion-to hell with the national interest and to,45
NA,hell with any concept of what is right for the,45
NA,Australian economy. They are still to compre-,45
NA,hend-,45
Mr HOWARD ," Mr Speaker, I raise a point",45
NA,of order. You gave a few moments ago what,45
NA,I am sure you wanted to be seen as an even-,45
NA,handed declaration from the Chair.,45
NA,Mr Keating interjecting-,45
Mr HOWARD ,Why don't you stop inter-,45
NA,"rupting, you mug!",45
Mr SPEAKER,The honourable member,45
NA,for Bennelong might not respond to interjec-,45
NA,tions and get to the point of order.,45
Mr HOWARD ,And he might not interject.,45
NA,You might reprimand the Prime Minister for,45
NA,"a change. Mr Speaker, you gave what I know",45
NA,you wanted to be seen as an even-handed,45
NA,"interpretation of the situation, given the",45
NA,constraints of the Standing Orders. I have to,45
NA,"draw your attention to the fact, by way of a",45
NA,"point of order, that the Treasurer has gone on",45
NA,at inordinate length. He has answered the,45
NA,substance of the question. He has padded out,45
NA,that answer with a deliberate attack on the,45
NA,"Opposition, and it seems to us in clear defi-",45
NA,ance of the injunction in your ruling that,45
NA,Ministers should shorten their answers.,45
Mr SPEAKER,I was listening very,45
NA,"intently, and the way the Treasurer was going",45
NA,I feel sure he was intending to wind up.,45
Mr DAWKINS,lam indeed. I might just,45
NA,say that it is not surprising that these revela-,45
NA,tions of mine would make the honourable,45
NA,member for Bennelong blush. At least he,45
NA,"would understand the internal inconsistency,",45
NA,"the mess that the Opposition is now in, and",45
NA,the total irresponsibility of its position. I am,45
NA,"quite sure that, if asked, he would not em-",45
NA,Is he brace such an approach.,45
NA,Budget Deficit,45
Dr HEWSON,"My question, directed to",45
NA,"the Treasurer, is a question in the national",45
NA,interest in terms of his previous answer. Is it,45
NA,"a fact that, using his own estimates, the Gov-",45
NA,ernment will need about $8 to $10 billion per,45
NA,year-I will repeat that: $8 to $10 billion per,45
NA,year-in extra revenue before its proposed tax,45
NA,cuts to fulfil its commitment to reduce the,45
NA,deficit to one per cent of GOP by 1996-977,45
NA,Is it also a fact that the tax cuts he has prom-,45
NA,ised will reduce government revenue by $16,45
NA,billion by 1996-977,45
Mr DAWKINS,"Once again, we have the",45
NA,"Opposition doing what only it can do, and",45
NA,that is to speculate about what might be the,45
NA,consequences of certain policy initiatives. The,45
NA,Leader of the Opposition has yet to get over,45
NA,the fact that he is over there and we are over,45
NA,here and he has not got the opportunity to,45
NA,"propose measures of his own, but I might",45
NA,invite the Leader of the Opposition to answer,45
NA,the question of how it is that his shadow,45
NA,Treasurer can go around promising increases,45
NA,in family allowance-,45
Mr HOWARD ," Mr Speaker, I raise a point",45
NA,of order. The Leader of the Opposition asked,45
NA,a very specific question. He sought two,45
NA,precise pieces of information. He sought a,45
NA,statement from the Treasurer as to whether,45
NA,the Government would need $8 to $10 billion,45
NA,a year in extra revenue to fulfil a commitment,45
NA,to reduce the deficit to one per cent of GOP.,45
NA,He also asked: was it a fact that the One,45
NA,Nation tax cuts will cut revenue by $16,45
NA,billion? They were very precise questions.,45
NA,The Treasurer's answer now is totally irrel-,46
NA,evant to those very precise questions. I invite,46
NA,"you, under standing order 145, to tell the",46
NA,Treasurer to sit down unless be becomes,46
NA,relevant.,46
Mr BEAZLEY ," Mr Speaker, I take a point of",46
NA,order. There is a time-honoured process by,46
NA,which we raise points of order in this place.,46
NA,That process obliges a member raising a point,46
NA,"of order, so it does not by itself become a",46
NA,"disorderly process, to state precisely the point 1996-97.",46
NA,"of order that he wishes raised, the point which",46
NA,"he is challenging, and not to debate it. All",46
NA,points that have been raised so far by the,46
NA,Opposition today have included debating,46
NA,elements in the way in which those points,46
NA,have been raised. You are quite capable of,46
NA,interpreting this without their help.,46
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The honourable,46
NA,member for Bennelong raised an interesting,46
NA,point in respect of the preamble that might,46
NA,accompany a Minister's answer. I am sure the,46
NA,Minister is getting to the specifics of the,46
NA,"answer, and I would invite the Minister to do",46
NA,so.,46
Mr DAWKINS,"Of course I am, Mr",46
NA,Speaker. It is entirely relevant to expose the,46
NA,bona fides of those people who ask these,46
NA,kinds of questions. As I indicated a moment,46
NA,"ago, I was in the process of doing so. The",46
NA,shadow Treasurer is running around proposing,46
NA,increases in expenditure which the Opposition,46
NA,proposed would be covered by revenue,46
NA,"coming from the GST. But, apparently, the",46
NA,GST has now been abandoned. The Opposi-,46
NA,tion is bereft of policy-totally bereft of,46
NA,policy-and yet it continues to recycle bits of,46
NA,it-,46
NA,"Mr Aldred- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of",46
NA,"order. On the matter of relevance, you gave",46
NA,a very specific direction to the Minister with,46
NA,which he is not complying. I ask you to have,46
NA,him comply with your direction.,46
Mr SPEAKER,There is no point of,46
NA,order. The Treasurer is answering the ques-,46
NA,tion.,46
Mr DAWKINS,At the time the Govern-,46
NA,"ment announced the changes to the tax scales,",46
NA,it indicated the prospective cost to the rev-,46
NA,enue. The Government has made subsequent,46
NA,"announcements, which were also costed in the",46
NA,context of the recent election campaign. The,46
NA,Opposition will have to wait until such time,46
NA,as the Government produces details of its,46
NA,"proposals in the Budget, not just for this",46
NA,forthcoming financial year but also for the,46
NA,way in which it intends to meet the very,46
NA,solemn undertaking it made in the election,46
NA,context to reduce the size of the government,46
NA,deficit to one per cent of the GDP by the year,46
NA,How the Government will do that will,46
NA,the become peifectly clear in the Budget context.,46
NA,Until the Budget is produced the Opposition,46
NA,"will have to continue on its merry way,",46
NA,speculating however it likes but recognising,46
NA,that as every day goes past fewer and fewer,46
NA,people will take any notice of it whatsoever.,46
NA,Shipbuilding,46
Mr STEPHEN SMITH,My question is,46
NA,"directed to the Minister for Industry, Technol-",46
NA,ogy and Regional Development. What action,46
NA,has the Minister taken to encourage the,46
NA,development of the Australian shipbuilding,46
NA,industry? Can the Minister also inform the,46
NA,House about the impact of this action on the,46
NA,industry in Western Australia?,46
Mr GRIFFITHS,I thank the honourable,46
NA,member for Perth for his question. Shipbuild-,46
NA,ing is an extremely important industry in,46
NA,"Western Australia, as it is in the rest of the",46
NA,country. This particular industry is without,46
NA,doubt one of Australia's manufacturing,46
NA,success stories. The industry has changed,46
NA,since the 1970s when it was characterised by,46
NA,"industrial unrest, high levels of government",46
NA,support and the production of large steel,46
NA,vessels for a declining international market.,46
NA,"Today the industry is a major export earner,",46
NA,specialising in products for niche markets.,46
NA,Some producers are already recognised as,46
NA,world leaders due to their innovative approach,46
NA,to design and production technology. The next,46
NA,two years promise to be years of strong,46
NA,export growth coupled with increased employ-,46
NA,ment for the industry. The value of vessels,46
NA,expected to be completed by shipbuilders this,46
NA,"year is nearly $300 million, which is about",46
NA,double the industry outcome of the previous,46
NA,year.,46
NA,"By way of contrast, the Opposition would",47
NA,have had that perfonnance under considerable,47
NA,threat by removing any semblance of govern-,47
NA,ment assistance for the industry. The Govern-,47
NA,"ment, however, believes that Australia's",47
NA,shipbuilders deserve at least the same level of,47
NA,backing from government as other Australian,47
NA,manufacturers get while they tackle the,47
NA,challenges before them. The industry's ability,47
NA,to successfully respond is best illustrated by,47
NA,the reputation for quality and perfonnance,47
NA,"enjoyed by companies such as Oceanfast,",47
NA,"Austral and Wavemaster in Perth, Incat in",47
NA,"Tasmania, and NQEA and Lloyds in Queens-",47
NA,land.,47
NA,I am pleased to be able to advise the House,47
NA,that the Government will legislate to extend,47
NA,the bounty in line with general manufacturing,47
NA,tariffs from 1 July 1993. To honour the,47
NA,commitment made by the Prime Minister in,47
NA,"the course of the election campaign, we will",47
NA,introduce the legislation into the Parliament,47
NA,tomorrow. The cost of this assistance-I,47
NA,regard it more as an investment-will be,47
NA,$43.8 million over four years. In order to,47
NA,pursue further some of the associated issues,47
NA,"in the industry, next week I will be visiting",47
NA,shipyards in Western Australia-with the,47
NA,honourable member for Perth-and Queens-,47
NA,land to see for myself the leading edge of this,47
NA,new industry.,47
NA,Government Finances,47
Dr HEWSON,My question is directed to,47
NA,"the Treasurer, and again it is in the national",47
NA,interest. I ask the Treasurer: given the inde-,47
NA,pendent findings of the Auditor-General that,47
NA,the Government has financial obligations of,47
NA,at least $127 billion against liquid assets of,47
NA,"just $57 billion, how can he justify trying to",47
NA,fund the Government's debts by bludging on,47
NA,the future of our children?,47
Mr DAWKINS,Of course this discloses,47
NA,the absolute irresponsibility of the Leader of,47
NA,"the Opposition, because he knows just how",47
NA,wrong and conceptually inaccurate this report,47
NA,"is. He knows that, and yet he is proposing to",47
NA,continue to highlight these entirely inaccurate,47
NA,propositions. On 13 April my department was,47
NA,"asked to comment on this report and, amongst",47
NA,"other things, the department indicated the",47
NA,following to the authors of the report:,47
NA,I particularly draw your attention to the statement,47
NA,in the first paragraph of the draft report which,47
NA,carries a clear implication that the Commonwealth,47
NA,may not be able to meet its obligations in the,47
NA,"future. This is unwarranted, unprofessional and",47
NA,irresponsible.,47
NA,Whilst to some extent the authors toned down,47
NA,"the paragraph in question, they left the clear",47
NA,impression that the Commonwealth might,47
NA,have some difficulties in meeting its future,47
NA,obligations. This is untrue. The Leader of the,47
NA,"Opposition knows it is untrue, and the",47
NA,"authors-if they were properly qualified, if",47
NA,they were capable of dealing with the is-,47
NA,sues-would have known so as well.,47
NA,The responsibility for drawing together a,47
NA,government response to this report rests with,47
NA,"the Minister for Finance, and I am sure that",47
NA,if the Leader of the Opposition were to ask,47
NA,him further questions about this he would be,47
NA,only too happy to respond. I would make this,47
NA,observation: the burden of this report is all,47
NA,about the need to disclose the Common-,47
NA,wealth's financial obligations-the need for,47
NA,"disclosure. What, on this central topic, is the",47
NA,conclusion and recommendation of this,47
NA,report? This report says at recommendation,47
NA,15:,47
NA,The ANAO recommends that the Commonwealth,47
NA,continues to develop plans for the introduction of,47
NA,whole of government reporting on an accrual basis,47
NA,with a view to implementing whole of government,47
NA,reporting by the end of the 1994-95 financial year.,47
NA,That is precisely what the Government is,47
NA,"doing. Indeed, the Minister for Finance, in a",47
NA,"statement he made last year, announced that",47
NA,we were moving in that direction. It is one,47
NA,thing for the Auditor-General and his,47
NA,"authors-in this case, Warren, Lynne, Mal-",47
NA,colm and Susi-to draw attention to issues of,47
NA,"importance to the public, but it should be",47
NA,noted that the infonnation in this report is,47
NA,public infonnation. It is drawn from public,47
NA,information largely available within the,47
NA,Budget. If the Auditor-General believes that,47
NA,that infonnation should be presented in a,47
NA,"different way, he is entitled to say so. All that",47
NA,the authors are saying on this occasi()n is that,47
NA,the Government should proceed with its,47
NA,already announced plans about the presenta-,47
NA,tion of this infonnation. In the words of the,47
NA,"Treasury, it is neither warranted, professional",47
NA,nor responsible for the Auditor-General or,48
NA,those in his office to raise speculation that,48
NA,Commonwealth is unable to meet its emerging,48
NA,financial obligations. This morning one of the,48
NA,authors was asked:,48
NA,Does this mean that the Commonwealth is techni-,48
NA,cally insolvent?,48
NA,And she said:,48
NA,"No, certainly not.",48
NA,She went on to say:,48
NA,We also have not taken into account in the report,48
NA,"the Commonwealth's power to tax, which of course",48
NA,should always ensure that the Commonwealth,48
NA,remains solvent.,48
NA,It is hardly an irrelevant point that the,48
NA,Commonwealth in every Budget makes the,48
NA,decision about the extent to which it will,48
NA,"borrow, the extent to which it will pay back,",48
NA,and the extent to which it will balance its,48
NA,recurrent and future obligations. It is hardly,48
NA,"a small point that the Commonwealth, unlike",48
NA,"a private business, does have the power to tax",48
NA,and does have the power to arrange the,48
NA,finances of the Commonwealth as suits the,48
NA,economic circumstances of the time. So there,48
NA,are some conceptual inaccuracies in this,48
NA,"report, and I am quite sure the Minister for",48
NA,Finance will be pointing out those problems,48
NA,and inaccuracies in the response that the,48
NA,Commonwealth will make to this report.,48
NA,Government Programs,48
Mr CLEELAND,I direct my question to something,48
NA,the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister,48
NA,seen reports that the Opposition intends,48
NA,oppose government reforms and legislative,48
NA,changes as an act of vengeance for losing the,48
NA,so-called unlosable 13 March election? Can,48
NA,the Prime Minister say what effects such a,48
NA,policy would have on the delivery of governreally,48
NA,ment programs and whether it would impede,48
NA,the democratic right of the Government,48
NA,fulfil its mandate?,48
NA,"Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I take a",48
NA,point of order in respect of the question from,48
NA,the honourable member for MCEwen. The,48
NA,second part of his question falls well outside,48
NA,the responsibility of the Prime Minister as,48
NA,relates to the Opposition in pure and simple,48
NA,form and as such should be ruled out,48
NA,order.,48
Mr SPEAKER,"No, there is no point of",48
NA,the order. The question was clearly in order in,48
NA,that it asked for the Prime Minister to talk,48
NA,about the Government.,48
Mr KEATING,I must say I was very,48
NA,surprised to hear the Leader of the Opposition,48
NA,saying that the Opposition would be 'very,48
NA,revengeful'. He said the Government would,48
NA,be-and he repeated it-revengeful.,48
NA,Opposition members-The Government?,48
Mr KEATING,"No, the Opposition would",48
NA,be 'very revengeful'. That is what he said.,48
NA,Revenge is a politically very violent word and,48
NA,one that I would have thought the Leader of,48
NA,the Opposition would. have done well to have,48
NA,stayed away from. Why does he wish to be,48
NA,revengeful? The answer is because he was,48
NA,"rejected by the Australian people, because he",48
NA,lost the election his party said was unlosable.,48
NA,So now he will sit back and sulk and sabotage,48
NA,"public policy to be, as he put it, revengeful.",48
NA,"In a recent interview he said, 'Our job now",48
NA,is to oppose'. So this is the Opposition we,48
NA,"have, an Opposition which says its lot in life",48
NA,is to oppose and be revengeful. That is no,48
NA,exaggeration-it is a direct quote: your job is,48
NA,"to oppose and be revengeful. And why, if not",48
NA,simply to straighten up the public for reject-,48
NA,ing him? He said in the book which is written,48
NA,by Ms Wallace:,48
NA,If we can't win by doing what's right there is,48
NA,fundamentally wrong with Australia.,48
NA,"The country is wrong, not him. He has been",48
NA,to put back in his place. What is his motive,48
NA,now? Revenge; to be revengeful; to oppose.,48
NA,His new contribution to Australian political,48
NA,leadership is to be revengeful and to oppose.,48
NA,This is the person who told us he was not,48
NA,a political figure; he was a consultant,48
NA,who was hired to give Australia good public,48
NA,to policy and he would not worry about the,48
NA,political impacts of these things. But one,48
NA,democratic judgment by the electorate and he,48
NA,sulks back to the recesses of the darkness of,48
NA,"the liberal mind, to be what? To be revenge-",48
NA,ful and to oppose. We are seeing this in the,48
NA,it irresponsibility which the Treasurer referred,48
NA,to in what has already been the rejection of a,48
NA,of number of measures for which the Govern-,48
NA,ment had a clear and specific mandate in the,48
NA,election. Let me just infonn the House that,49
NA,"the income test free area for jobsearch,",49
NA,newstart and sickness allowance-,49
NA,Mr Ruddock-Taking pensioners out of,49
NA,the tax system.,49
Mr SPEAKER,Order!,49
NA,"Mr Ruddock-Well, he did, Mr Speaker.",49
Mr KEATING,You are heading for your,49
NA,second 20 years in opposition. The introducWhole,49
NA,tion of an earned income-free area of $30,49
NA,"fortnight for single people, and an increase in Minister-",49
NA,the earned income-free area for partner recipi-,49
NA,"ents of $20 a fortnight, meaning 89,000 permitted-",49
NA,clients each fortnight would be better off with,49
NA,an average increase in fortnightly payments,49
NA,"around $20, was rejected by the Opposition",49
NA,in the Senate.,49
NA,There were changes in the same Bill to,49
NA,waiting period. The ordinary waiting,49
NA,will be waived for claimants of jobsearch,49
NA,"allowance, newstart allowance and sickness",49
NA,allowance where the claimant has been on,49
NA,income support within the previous 13 weeks.,49
NA,Fifty-four thousand six hundred clients will,49
NA,assisted by these changes. The starting date,49
NA,20 September 1993. That was rejected by the,49
NA,Opposition in the Senate. With the easing,49
NA,"the assets test withdrawal rate, the assets test",49
NA,for pensioners will be eased so that the,49
NA,pension will be reduced by $19.50 rather,49
NA,$26 per year for every $250 of assets above,49
NA,"the threshold. Mr Speaker, 48,800 pensioners",49
NA,and non-pensioner retirees will benefit from,49
NA,"this change. Again, this was rejected by the",49
NA,Opposition in the Senate. Total winners from,49
NA,"the legislation will be 192,400 people. This",49
NA,after the Leader of the OppOSition said in a,49
NA,"press statement last week, 'The fact is that the",49
NA,Keating Government does not give a damn,49
NA,about how many Australians are affected by,49
NA,broken promises'. He opposes things which,49
NA,the Government clearly said were part of its,49
NA,policy speech for which it sought and got,49
NA,mandate at the election.,49
NA,The same Bill also extends benefits under,49
NA,veterans affairs' legislation to members of,49
NA,Australian Defence Force serving with the,49
NA,United Nations peacekeeping forces-,49
NA,"Mr Tim Fischer-I raise a point of order,",49
NA,Mr Speaker. We cannot have Rafferty's rules,49
NA,and lies before this House.,49
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The Leader of the,49
NA,National Party will withdraw that remark.,49
NA,Mr Tim Fischer-I withdraw the word,49
NA,'lies'. We cannot have total misleading of the,49
NA,truth. The Senate's amendment to the Veter-,49
NA,ans Affairs' Legislation Amendment Bill is,49
NA,under consideration by the Committee of the,49
NA,"today, and as such cannot be the",49
NA,per subject of detailed debate by the Prime,49
Mr SPEAKER,Anticipated debate is not,49
NA,Mr Tim Fischer-It is already part heard.,49
NA,of The debate commenced before lunch.,49
Mr SPEAKER,You have made your,49
NA,point of order. You will resume your seat.,49
NA,the The· Prime Minister would be aware of that,49
NA,period and will continue his answer.,49
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,49
Mr KEATING,If those opposite had,49
NA,"supported it, it would not be back here. The",49
NA,Opposition rejected it over there. It attached,49
NA,be to it an amendment to turn over a 1992,49
NA,is Budget measure relating to shares and the,49
NA,"income test; in other words, those opposite",49
NA,"of are into revenge, obfuscation and just being",49
NA,"villains. They are irresponsible, stupid people.",49
NA,That is what they are about being. The same,49
NA,than Bill also includes an amendment to extend,49
NA,operational service in Cambodia to areas in,49
NA,Laos and Thailand that are no more than 50,49
NA,kilometres from the border of Cambodia and,49
NA,amendments as a result of the changes desig-,49
NA,nating Somalia and the area comprising the,49
NA,is fonner Yugoslavia as operational areas.,49
NA,"Those measures, along with the changes to",49
NA,"the income test area for the jobsearch,",49
NA,"newstart and sickness allowance, changes to",49
NA,"the waiting period, and easing of the assets",49
NA,"test withdrawal rate, have all been knocked",49
NA,a back by the coalition in the Senate to append,49
NA,a paltry amendment about a Budget measure,49
NA,"of a year ago, while the Leader of the Oppo-",49
NA,sition has the gall to put out a statement,49
NA,the saying that he does not give a damn about,49
NA,how many Australians are affected by broken,49
NA,promises. The Leader of the Opposition has,49
NA,made it clear what his contribution to the,50
NA,"political debate is going to be. He said, 'Our",50
NA,job is to oppose and be revengeful'. Maybe,50
NA,there are some more serious minds in the,50
NA,Opposition that might think about terminating,50
NA,his mandate to lead anybody.,50
NA,Members' and Senators: Ethics,50
Mr MACK,I direct my question to the,50
NA,Prime Minister. I refer to the working group,50
NA,convened in the 36th Parliament by the,50
NA,Speaker and the President· of the Senate to,50
NA,draw up ethical guidelines for members and,50
NA,senators. Is it the intention of the Prime,50
NA,Minister to continue this initiative? Is he March 1990.,50
NA,aware of the recent recommendations on,50
NA,ethics by a committee of the .Queensland,50
NA,Parliament and the decision of the Goss,50
NA,Government to establish in legislation mandathe,50
NA,tory ethical codes for both parliamentarians,50
NA,and public serVants? Will the Prime Minister,50
NA,ensure that the ethics working group of this,50
NA,Parliament is reconvened and that its scope,50
NA,extended to include the conduct of public,50
NA,servants?,50
Mr KEATING,"On the latter point, I am",50
NA,not certain whether any issue that has arisen,50
NA,of recent times reflects upon the conduct of,50
NA,public servants in terms of ethics. Be that as,50
NA,"it may, I am quite happy to see the Parliament",50
NA,continue to look at the question of ethics in,50
NA,this cycle. Perhaps we could start by having,50
NA,members of the Opposition in the Senate,50
NA,with the rest of the Parliament in tabling their,50
NA,"interests, so that at least people know where",50
NA,they stand as a point of reference for,50
NA,operation of such a regime. There are many,50
NA,issues involved and I know that the commitWomen's,50
NA,tee has been working on this for some time.,50
NA,No doubt at some appropriate time it will,50
NA,present its report to the Parliament.,50
NA,Parental Leave,50
Ms CRAWFORD,My question is directed,50
NA,to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Can,50
NA,the Minister advise the House as to the,50
NA,Government's intentions in relation to providthe,50
NA,ing Australian workers with an entitlement,50
NA,unpaid parental leave.,50
Mr BRERETON,"The honourable member there,",50
NA,will be pleased to know that the Government,50
NA,will introduce legislation guaranteeing the,50
NA,"right to unpaid parental leave, as announced",50
NA,during the election campaign. I notice that,50
NA,there have been reports in the press recently,50
NA,that the Government had backed away from,50
NA,that pledge. Whilst the matter does involve,50
NA,some serious and complex legal issues I am,50
NA,able to inform the House that these complexi-,50
NA,ties have now been overcome in consultation,50
NA,with the acting Solicitor-General. I can now,50
NA,advise the House that such legislation can be,50
NA,based on the external affairs powers of the,50
NA,Australian Constitution. This will give effect,50
NA,to Australia's obligation as a party to ILO,50
NA,convention 156 ratified by Australia on 30,50
NA,Parental leave allows a parent to leave the,50
NA,work force after the birth of a child to care,50
NA,for the child without having to resign from,50
NA,parent's job. The ILO convention requires,50
NA,government to take measures so that the needs,50
NA,of workers who have family responsibilities,50
NA,are properly taken into account in their terms,50
NA,is and conditions of employment. The conven-,50
NA,"tion also requires, I am able to inform the",50
NA,"House, governments to take measures to",50
NA,enable those workers to re-enter the labour,50
NA,force after an absence caused by their family,50
NA,responsibilities. The legislation guaranteeing,50
NA,parental leave will therefore be a very import-,50
NA,ant part of the Government's comprehensive,50
NA,strategy for implementing its ILO obligations.,50
NA,"In developing the legislation, there will be",50
NA,join detailed discussions with the States and,50
NA,"Territories, employer and union bodies, and",50
NA,other interested groups. Yesterday I was able,50
NA,the to give an assurance of the Government's,50
NA,commitment to legislate in this area to the,50
NA,Electoral Lobby. I will now be,50
NA,refining the details with the Minister Assisting,50
NA,"the Prime Minister for the Status of Women,",50
NA,as well as discussing arrangements for further,50
NA,consultation with women about industrial,50
NA,relations change.,50
NA,Investment,50
NA,Mr -DOWNER-My question is directed to,50
NA,Treasurer. I remind the Treasurer of the,50
NA,to Prime Minister's statements in the election,50
NA,"campaign: 'investment is picking up', 'sitting",50
NA,"$130 billion of registered investment',",50
NA,'all about to move like a big avalanche'. I,50
NA,also refer the Treasurer to today's disastrous,50
NA,private capital expenditure figures showing a,51
NA,10 per cent real fall in equipment expenditure,51
NA,in just one quarter. Is this the big avalanche,51
NA,"which the Prime Minister had in mind, or is",51
NA,this just another one of Labor's avalanche of,51
NA,broken promises that the Prime Minister has,51
NA,become the superstar of!,51
NA,Mr DAWKlNS'-Once again the honour-,51
NA,able member for Mayo reveals the paucity of,51
NA,his understanding of some of the weighty,51
NA,issues which he is supposed to be able to deal,51
NA,"with. Of course, I have seen the investment",51
NA,figures as revealed by the ABS today. It is,51
NA,true that they do reveal a fall from a very,51
NA,high rise a quarter ago.,51
NA,One of the most elementary things which,51
NA,any aspiring shadow Treasurer should under-,51
NA,stand is the danger in making assessments on,51
NA,the basis of one month's or even one quarter's,51
NA,"figures. Also, any aspiring shadow Treasurer",51
NA,should realise and not discount that there is,51
NA,an element of responsibility involved in not,51
NA,immediately assuming that the country is,51
NA,confronting massive gloom on the basis of,51
NA,one quarter's investment figures.,51
NA,The Government is looking forward to an,51
NA,improvement in investment perfonnance in,51
NA,"Australia and, indeed, it will be an essential",51
NA,part of the recovery as it strengthens. When,51
NA,that happens will depend on decisions of the,51
NA,"private sector, bearing in mind that there is",51
NA,very strong productivity growth being record-,51
NA,"ed in the Australian economy at the moment,",51
NA,which in a way serves to postpone in some,51
NA,businesses the need for additional capital,51
NA,investment.,51
NA,But that is an entirely different point to,51
NA,point that the Prime Minister was making,51
NA,"about investment projects down the track, as",51
NA,revealed by applications for the development,51
NA,allowance. That was about applications for the,51
NA,allowance which had to be in by the end of,51
NA,December last year. It was not about invest-,51
NA,ment in the last quarter or even in the next,51
NA,quarter; it was about investment which was,51
NA,going to take place over the next several,51
NA,years in order to qualify for the investment,51
NA,allowance.,51
NA,I will be publishing the latest report of the,51
NA,Development Allowance Authority which will,51
NA,"spell out, in more detail than the Prime",51
NA,"Minister was able to before the election, the",51
NA,scheduling of that investment. What it will,51
NA,reveal is just how solid those investment,51
NA,proposals are as proposed by the corporations,51
NA,in Australia which have applied for the,51
NA,development allowance.,51
NA,I would have thought that this is not an,51
NA,"occasion for the Opposition, and particularly",51
NA,"the shadow Treasurer, simply to be latching",51
NA,onto any negative statistic and producing this,51
NA,as evidence of poor perfonnance in the,51
NA,Australian economy. Rather one would have,51
NA,thought that the Opposition would have been,51
NA,pleased to play its part in indicating what,51
NA,great promise there is in Australia and what,51
NA,great promise has been identified by a large,51
NA,number of corporations in Australia which are,51
NA,prepared to commit billions of dollars towards,51
NA,the development of this great country.,51
NA,.Youth Initiatives,51
Mr ADAMS,My question is addressed to,51
NA,"the Minister for Employment, Education and",51
NA,Training. We are coming up to the anniversa-,51
NA,ry of the youth summit. Can the Minister,51
NA,infonn the House of progress in the imple-,51
NA,mentation of youth summit initiatives?,51
Mr BEAZLEY,"Yes, I can do that for the",51
NA,honourable member. Under the package we,51
NA,expected that by the end of this year some,51
NA,"96,300 places in a mixture of programs will",51
NA,be provided for young people and we are well,51
NA,on track in achieving that target. There are,51
NA,some notable features of it that are worth the,51
NA,"consideration of the House,· particularly in the",51
NA,area of apprentices and trainees. There has,51
NA,the been a rise of some 16 per cent in apprentice-,51
NA,ships in the period July 1992 to March 1993,51
NA,above the equivalent period the year before.,51
NA,In the case of traineeships for the same period,51
NA,there has been a lift of some 94 per cent over,51
NA,"the previous period. So almost 17,500 unem-",51
NA,ployed apprentices and apprentices at risk of,51
NA,losing their jobs have been helped through,51
NA,special assistance measures.,51
NA,"Another program, the landcare and environ-",51
NA,"ment action program, was slated for some",51
NA,"6,000 places by the end of 1993. It has",51
NA,proved so popular that we expect that be-,51
NA,"tween 10,000 and 11,000 young people will",51
NA,benefit in the course of this year. In the youth,51
NA,career and infonnation advice program we,52
NA,"have had some 60,000 young people take",52
NA,advantage of opportunities for career advice.,52
NA,"Some 3,000 students and over 1,600 trainees",52
NA,have now signed up in some 100 pilot pro-,52
NA,grams associated with the new vocational,52
NA,certificate program.,52
NA,Since the youth summit in July 1992 the,52
NA,number of 15to 19-year-olds unemployed,52
NA,and looking for full-time work has fallen by,52
NA,"some 16,300, a reduction of 12.2 per cent,",52
NA,and the proportion of teenagers who are full-,52
NA,time unemployed has fallen from 10.1 per,52
NA,"cent to nine per cent. There are now 41,000",52
NA,fewer unemployed teenagers than when Labor,52
NA,"came to office, and the proportion of teenag-",52
NA,ers unemployed has fallen from 12.3 per cent,52
NA,"to nine per cent. Of course, one cannot say",52
NA,from of any of these statistics that the job,52
NA,"been completed, but they are a pretty fair",52
NA,indication that the objectives set by the Prime,52
NA,Minister in the youth summit that he organ-,52
NA,"ised have, to a very substantial degree, been",52
NA,met.,52
NA,Trans-Tasman Shipping,52
Mr SHARP,My question is directed to,52
NA,the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime,52
NA,Minister that' he has identified micro-,52
NA,economic refonn as one of his Government's,52
NA,highest priorities. I also remind him that the,52
NA,Australian Business Council has identified the,52
NA,scrapping of the expensive and illegal trade,52
NA,union restrictions on Trans-Tasman shipping,52
NA,as one of the highest priorities for micro-,52
NA,economic reform. What did the Prime,52
NA,Minister do about fixing this during his trip,52
NA,to New Zealand last week? Does the illegal,52
NA,union agreement still stand?,52
Mr KEATING,One has to have a lot of,52
NA,front to come from the Opposition and talk,52
NA,"about the maritime industries of this country,",52
NA,"because every bad habit, every bit of sclerosis",52
NA,that was in the waterfront and in the oper-,52
NA,ations of the shipping services around this,52
NA,"country, was there over the 30-odd years that",52
NA,the coalition was in office. It was quite happy,52
NA,to let the P&Os of this world run the place,52
NA,with a spare pool of labour that belonged to,52
NA,no-one in particular but cost everyone in,52
NA,"general, and it was quite happy for this to be",52
NA,a dead hand upon Australia. But all of a,52
NA,sudden when this Government arrived it was,52
NA,"all our job to fix. Of course, largely fix it we",52
NA,"have, with a turnaround time now for contain-",52
NA,ers in Sydney comparable to ports such as,52
NA,"Rotterdam, a 50 per cent decline in the",52
NA,number of people in the waterfront in the last,52
NA,"12 months, and now DECO levels on crew",52
NA,manning on Australian ships that have fallen,52
NA,from around 30 crew per vessel to 21 and,52
NA,heading for 19. The problem of uncompetitive,52
NA,shipping services has been repaired· at source,52
NA,by dealing with the structure of the manning,52
NA,"of Australian line vessels, and the result is",52
NA,that they are eminently more competitive.,52
NA,Need I say that as a result of these develop-,52
NA,ments we are also seeing other services. There,52
NA,are ones now not just from Melbourne and,52
NA,Sydney to New Zealand but one from Bris-,52
NA,"has bane to New Zealand and, as a consequence,",52
NA,we are seeing a more competitive structure,52
NA,come into place.,52
NA,Mr Sharp-What about the Trans-Tasman,52
NA,accord?,52
Mr KEATING,The honourable member,52
NA,"for Hume asks about, as he puts it, the Trans-",52
NA,Tasman accord. The Government has no bar,52
NA,on anyone using a ship anywhere in the,52
NA,country. If a shipper wants to use a service,52
NA,"other than the current services, then he will.",52
NA,"But he probably will not, and will not need",52
NA,"to, while ever we are seeing a substantial shift",52
NA,in the competitiveness of the Australian,52
NA,maritime fleet.,52
NA,"Mr Sharp-Come on, come on. That's not",52
NA,the answer.,52
Mr KEATING,That is the answer. That,52
NA,is the answer that matters.,52
NA,Mr Sharp-You didn't do anything about,52
NA,it.,52
Mr KEATING,The Opposition did,52
NA,nothing about the whole industry for 30 years.,52
NA,Members of the Opposition have some front;,52
NA,they really have. They sat there with this,52
NA,"clogged up waterfront, with a pool of labour",52
NA,"which was not even company hired, which",52
NA,had loyalties to no-one in particular and was,52
NA,a general cost to the whole waterfront. They,52
NA,saw the stevedoring companies and the unions,52
NA,"playoff the shippers like a break, and what",52
NA,did they do about all those years when the,52
NA,honourable member for Bennelong was,53
NA,"Treasurer or, dare I say it, when the Leader",53
NA,of the Opposition was his adviser? Did we,53
NA,"ever see any changes from them? No, it took",53
NA,"a bit of ticker, a little bit of intellect-in",53
NA,"short, a bit of courage-to do something",53
NA,about it. The coalition did not do anything,53
NA,"about it, and it was never able to. That is",53
NA,I am quite sure the conservative party in New,53
NA,Zealand holds this Opposition in the general,53
NA,contempt we hold it in.,53
NA,Energy Efficiency,53
Mr TANNER,I direct my question to the,53
NA,Minister for Primary Industries and Energy.,53
NA,What action is being taken· by the Govern-,53
NA,ment to improve energy efficiency in Austral-,53
NA,ia?,53
Mr CREAN , I thank the honourable,53
NA,member for his question. The House may be,53
NA,interested to know that Australians spend,53
NA,"annually $35 billion on energy in this country,",53
NA,and the Government has an energy manage-,53
NA,ment program that aims to target some $1.5,53
NA,billion per annum in savings through more,53
NA,efficient management practices. In relation to,53
NA,the way in which we have worked with,53
NA,"industry to drive this program, we have",53
NA,undertaken on a cost sharing basis the intro-,53
NA,duction of industry audits that have the,53
NA,potential to yield up to thirtyfold benefits,53
NA,industry from the government subsidy.,53
NA,"So far as the community is concerned, we",53
NA,have the Energy.guide that gives indications,53
NA,to consumers as to how they might be more,53
NA,efficient in the management of the way in,53
NA,"which they use energy and, more importantly,",53
NA,"a recently announced program, the local",53
NA,"energy efficiency program, that is funding",53
NA,community responses. I know the honourable,53
NA,member for Melbourne has expressed some,53
NA,keen interest in this program. I am pleased,53
NA,about that and I urge other honourable mem-,53
NA,bers in the House to take advantage of it as,53
NA,well.,53
NA,So far as the States are concerned-this is,53
NA,where some of the programs have not taken,53
NA,off as quickly as we would have liked-:-we,53
NA,"are seeking to develop, with the States,",53
NA,ratings schemes and codes in relation to,53
NA,"houses, house building, appliances and com-",53
NA,"mercial buildings. As for renewables, the",53
NA,alternative to the traditional forms of energy,53
NA,"production, the House should also be pleased",53
NA,to know that we have developed a series of,53
NA,programs to promote and demonstrate renew-,53
NA,able energy technology where it is cost,53
NA,effective. I am taking a particular interest in,53
NA,"why this area, not only for the efficiency it can",53
NA,yield but also for the industry opportunities,53
NA,and exports that it can develop.,53
NA,I will have the. opportunity tomorrow to,53
NA,announce as part of that program some,53
NA,"$800,000 in funding to successful projects",53
NA,under this scheme. At the ministerial entrance,53
NA,to the House between 10 and 12 tomorrow-I,53
NA,would again invite all honourable members to,53
NA,"participate-we will have the Energymobile,",53
NA,a travelling machine which is about to head,53
NA,off on a four-month tour to raise awareness,53
NA,regarding alternative energy production and,53
NA,"practices. Incidentally, that machine is run-",53
NA,"ning on diesohol, and again it is a program",53
NA,this Government has solidly supported.,53
NA,National Flag,53
Mr TIM FISCHER,My question is,53
NA,directed to the Prime Minister. I ask whether,53
NA,"it is true, as press reports have indicated, that",53
NA,when the Prime Minister was offered an Aus-,53
NA,tralian flag at the Sydney Town Hall last year,53
NA,"to by RSL President, Brigadier Alf Garland, he",53
NA,said:,53
NA,"No good giving it to me, give it back to one of",53
NA,your Pommy mates.,53
NA,What is the Prime Minister's current position,53
NA,on our Australian flag with his stampede for,53
NA,a republic?,53
Mr KEATING,Last year when I was in,53
NA,the Sydney Town Hall with the United States,53
NA,"Secretary of Defense, Mr Cheney, walking to",53
NA,"a reception in his honour, the President of the",53
NA,RSL jumped from the crowd in the aisle to,53
NA,force on me a flag to make a very lousy,53
NA,political point at the expense of the reception,53
NA,of the Secretary of Defense of the United,53
NA,States. Apparently the Leader of the National,53
NA,Party supports that kind of behaviour.,53
NA,Mr Ruddock-Of course I would proudly,53
NA,carry the nation's flag.,53
Mr KEATING,"Yes, but you do not shove",53
NA,it under the US Defense Secretary's nose,53
NA,when he is bounding around to a reception,54
NA,held in his honour in the Sydney Town Hall.,54
NA,Apparently the Leader of the National Party,54
NA,supports that sort of behaviour. That is why,54
NA,the President of the RSL has become the Alf,54
NA,Garnett of the RSL and why he is held gener-,54
NA,"ally, I think, in very low esteem by the RSL",54
NA,community.,54
NA,When Mr Garland came to see me not long,54
NA,after I became Prime Minister and we had the,54
NA,celebrations of the various comniemorative,54
NA,"events during 1992, after 50 years-the fall",54
NA,"of Singapore, the battle of Kokoda, et cete-",54
NA,ra-one of his requests to me was to pay for,54
NA,him to visit the United Kingdom to go to,54
NA,some ceremony that he said was important to,54
NA,him. The fact is that Mr Garland comes from,54
NA,that area of the RSL where people think the,54
NA,only place you can really hold your head up,54
NA,high is walking down Whitehall-and I have,54
NA,made that very clear to him every time I have,54
NA,seen him.,54
NA,Housing Products: Exports,54
Mr LES SCOTT ,Can the Minister for,54
NA,"Housing, Local Government and Community",54
NA,Services inform the House of the prospects,54
NA,for the export of housing products and ser-,54
NA,vices to the Asian markets? What action is the,54
NA,Government taking to develop the export,54
NA,prospects for this industry?,54
Mr HOWE,The issue of potential for,54
NA,exports in relation to the housing industry is,54
NA,a very important one for this Parliament.,54
NA,Progress on the Government's housing export,54
NA,strategy is proceeding strongly on a number,54
NA,"of fronts, including support for Australia's",54
NA,early involvement in a $1 billion World Bank,54
NA,"housing project in China, which could have",54
NA,very important spin-offs for Australian,54
NA,try.,54
NA,The Government is also considering the,54
NA,proposed establishment of an industry-govern- Paper.,54
NA,"ment joint venture facility in Jakarta, Indo-",54
NA,"nesia, to market Australian building product",54
NA,systems technology and training. The fast,54
NA,growing economies of Asia provide signifi-,54
NA,cant market opportunity for housing and,54
NA,related industries to take advantage of,54
NA,disposable incomes and a greater demand,54
NA,which is occurring for quality housing.,54
NA,Our housing industry is very efficient. It is,54
NA,highly skilled but its strong domestic perform-,54
NA,ance simply has not been reflected interna-,54
NA,tionally. The housing industry in Australia,54
NA,represents of the order of five per cent of,54
NA,GDP and yet a very small proportion of its,54
NA,product is exported overseas. If one took,54
NA,"comparable European countries, the percent-",54
NA,age of their domestic activity which results in,54
NA,export is of the order of 40 per cent-not a,54
NA,very minor percentage as is true in Australia.,54
NA,We want to work in partnership with industry,54
NA,to change that situation.,54
NA,Some Australian firms are already directly,54
NA,involved in a range of overseas projects. For,54
NA,"example, apartment complexes in Thailand",54
NA,"and Malaysia, a plasterboard factory in Indo-",54
NA,nesia and even the export of bricks and pavers,54
NA,"to Japan. In addition, Vietnam wants to",54
NA,develop a national building code based on the,54
NA,"building code of Australia, while the Bangkok",54
NA,metropolitan administration is interested in,54
NA,Australian assessments in the development of,54
NA,their building regulations.,54
NA,"To realise these opportunities, clearly a",54
NA,national strategic approach is required which,54
NA,"will draw on the expertise of industry, help",54
NA,companies to grasp early market opportuni-,54
NA,"ties, coordinate export activities, better assess",54
NA,"the market environments, and promote an",54
NA,understanding of the essentials of success in,54
NA,"exporting. I am hoping to an,nounce the",54
NA,details of Australia's export strategy in rela-,54
NA,tion to housing in August. It is important that,54
NA,"we take this very significant, quite efficient",54
NA,Australian industry and turn it into an export,54
NA,industry as part of a broader approach to the,54
NA,"region, where Australia's experience in",54
NA,housing and urban development can translate,54
NA,indusinto very significant export dollars.,54
Mr KEATING ," Mr Speaker, I ask that",54
NA,further questions be placed on the l{otice,54
NA,PRIVILEGE,54
Mr TUCKEY ,"O'Connor)- Mr Speaker, I",54
NA,wish to raise a matter of privilege. Today the,54
NA,Treasurer ( Mr Dawkins) read from a letter,54
NA,"higher which was sent to the Auditor-General,",54
NA,"presumably with the Treasurer's authority, in",54
NA,regard to a report on government debt pre-,54
NA,pared by the Auditor-General for this Parliafor,55
NA,ment. The Treasurer further claimed that as,55
NA,result of this letter certain changes by way,55
NA,moderation of this report to parliament,55
NA,"achieved. The Auditor-General reports, by",55
NA,"legislation, directly to this Parliament, for the",55
NA,clear and proper reason: to prevent the exec-,55
NA,utive government interfering in any way with,55
NA,"such reports. It is my view that any attempt,",55
NA,"particularly by the executive government,",55
NA,interfere with such reporting must represent,55
NA,a breach of parliamentary privilege.,55
NA,"Mr Speaker, I therefore request that you",55
NA,investigate and assess this already admitted,55
NA,action in regard to the existence of a prima may proceed.,55
NA,facie case for· presentation to the Committee,55
NA,on Privileges .which should further decide,55
NA,whether a breach has been made by the,55
NA,Minister or members of his department.,55
Mr SPEAKER,I will consider the matter,55
NA,that the honourable member for O'Connor has,55
NA,raised and will report back to the Parliament.,55
NA,"I call the Treasurer, on the same matter,",55
NA,indulgence.,55
Mr DAWKINS ,Fremantle-Treasurer)-,55
NA,"Mr Speaker, I am quite happy for you to",55
NA,consider this piece of nonsense and dismiss,55
NA,as I am sure you will.,55
Mr SPEAKER,It is not for the Treasurer,55
NA,to determine it. I will determine it.,55
Mr DAWKINS,I am talking about what,55
NA,the honourable member for O'Connor said.,55
NA,"Mr Thckey- Mr Speaker, on a point",55
NA,order-,55
Mr SPEAKER,The honourable member point.,55
NA,for O'Connor will resume his seat until the,55
NA,Treasurer has concluded.,55
Mr DAWKINS,I do so on this basis:,55
NA,"when the Auditor-General produces reports,",55
NA,quite frequently he sends draft copies of those,55
NA,reports to relevant departments asking for,55
NA,"their comments. Mr Speaker, you would well",55
NA,know that from your experience on the approvidual,55
NA,priate parliamentary committee which reviews,55
NA,these matters. That is crystal clear in this,55
NA,report-if the honourable member for O'Conabout,55
NA,nor had bothered to read it-because it,55
NA,includes the comments 'received back by,55
NA,Auditor-General'. So it would have been,55
NA,"shocking if my department, having been asked",55
NA,"its comments by the Auditor-General, did",55
NA,a not give them. All it did was comply with the,55
NA,of request by the Auditor-General to provide,55
NA,were comments on the draft report.,55
NA,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,55
Mr RUDDOCK ,"Berowra)- Mr Speaker,",55
NA,I wish to make a personal explanation in,55
NA,relation to the observations by the Prime,55
NA,to Minister ( Mr Keating) at Question Time.,55
Mr SPEAKER,Does the honourable,55
NA,member claim to have been misrepresented?,55
Mr RUDDOCK,"Yes, most grievously.",55
Mr SPEAKER,The honourable member,55
Mr RUDDOCK,The Prime Minister,55
NA,seriously misrepresented me and misled the,55
NA,House when he suggested that we had op-,55
NA,posed-,55
Mr SPEAKER,If the honourable member,55
NA,wishes to proceed with the second part of,55
NA,"by those comments, there are forms of the House",55
NA,to which the honourable member rightly,55
NA,knows he can refer.,55
Mr RUDDOCK," Mr Speaker, I will make",55
NA,"it, it very clear. When it was suggested that we",55
NA,had opposed-,55
Mr KEATING ,You are debating the point.,55
Mr RUDDOCK,It is not debating.,55
Mr SPEAKER,The honourable member,55
NA,will get to his personal explanation and say,55
NA,of where he has been misrepresented.,55
Mr RUDDOCK,"--..,It will be a very brief",55
NA,The point is that in this House and in,55
NA,the Senate we have at no time voted against,55
NA,"the proposals. In fact, today at Question",55
NA,Time-,55
Mr BEAZLEY ," Mr Speaker, on a point of",55
NA,order. My point of order is this: the Standing,55
NA,Orders relating to personal explanations are,55
NA,quite specific. They relate to where an indi-,55
NA,in this chamber has been misrepre-,55
NA,sented in this chamber or outside it. It is a,55
NA,simply stated matter. He is debating a point,55
NA,how he felt the Opposition somehow,55
NA,had been misrepresented. It is not an appro-,55
NA,the priate tool to use for this purpose.,55
Mr SPEAKER,The honourable member,55
NA,for Berowra has been invited to show where,55
NA,he has personally been misrepresented. I,56
NA,invite him to do so again or resume his seat.,56
Mr RUDDOCK,I carry responsibility for,56
NA,these matters.,56
Mr SPEAKER,No. Where he has been,56
NA,personally misrepresented.,56
Mr RUDDOCK,It is suggested in relation,56
NA,to these matters that I am opposed to these,56
NA,benefits being available to the unemployed.,56
NA,"The fact is that at no time have I, nor have",56
NA,"any of my colleagues, voted against these",56
NA,proposals.,56
Mr SPEAKER,The honourable member,56

NA,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,63
NA,Rio Earth Summit,63
Mrs KELLY ,Canberra-Minister for the,63
NA,"Environment, Sport and Territories)-by",63
NA,leave-My purpose in making this statement,63
NA,is to provide the House with infonnation on,63
NA,the Government's responses to the outcomes,63
NA,"of the Earth Summit, or the United Nations",63
NA,Conference on Environment and Develop-,63
NA,"ment, which was held in June 1992. The",63
NA,centrepiece documents of the summit-the,63
NA,UN conventions on climate change and,63
NA,"biological diversity, a statement of forest",63
NA,"principles and the action plan, agenda 21-are",63
NA,only the first steps in a process which we all,63
NA,acknowledge will occupy the global com-,63
NA,munity well into the next century. Neverthe-,63
NA,"less, they are crucial and historic steps. They",63
NA,involve commitment to the environment and,63
NA,to the needs and welfare of people. They,63
NA,involve challenges and opportunities for all,63
NA,countries. These international developments,63
NA,are paving the way to a sustainable future.,63
NA,Just as important for Australians is the com-,63
NA,mitment of this Government to our national,63
NA,environment.,63
NA,The Prime Minister ( Mr Keating) recently,63
NA,made two important statements on the envi-,63
NA,ronment-on 21 December 1992 and 9 March,63
NA,1993-which refocused oUr vision and our,63
NA,energies on the fundamental problems in the,63
NA,"Australian environment, and on the results we",63
NA,can obtain through cooperation. He said:,63
NA,Nothing better illustrates the interdependence of,63
NA,Australians and their communities than the environ-,63
NA,ment.,63
NA,Nothing more emphatically makes the point that all,63
NA,our State borders and provincial differences still,63
NA,leave one fact unassailable-that this is one,63
NA,continent and one nation.,63
NA,"And for good or bad, what we do in one part of it",63
NA,very often affects another.,63
NA,What one Australian does to the environment,63
NA,affects another Australian.,63
NA,He added:,63
NA,"The environment is central, it is part of the main",63
NA,"game, the main issue in which all Australians are",63
NA,being involved.,63
NA,"There is no doubt that this main game, in",63
NA,"which we are a player, is a global one. The",63
NA,outcomes of the Rio Earth Summit are the,63
NA,starting point from which all countries must,63
NA,now pursue an ecologically sustainable future.,63
NA,Let me start by outlining the action we have,63
NA,already taken in Australia to give effect to the,63
NA,two conventions and to agenda 21. Along,63
NA,"with 153 other countries, we signed the",63
NA,climate change convention in Rio. Although,63
NA,"called a framework convention, indicating that",63
NA,"there is much left to negotiate and agree, the",63
NA,climate change convention represents the end,63
NA,of a phase of global consensus building and,63
NA,education on the rationale and need for action,63
NA,on greenhouse gas emissions.,63
NA,The convention will enter into force and,63
NA,become legally binding on parties 90 days,63
NA,after· it has been ratified by 50 countries.,63
NA,Australia ratified the convention in December,63
NA,1992 and is one of 19 countries so far to have,63
NA,done so. Our expectation is that the conven-,63
NA,tion will achieve the necessary 50 ratifications,63
NA,in 1994.,63
NA,Australia played an active and significant,63
NA,role in the development of and negotiations,63
NA,"on the convention. I, in collaboration with the",63
NA,Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth,63
NA,Evans) and the Minister for Primary Industries,63
NA,"and Energy ( Mr Crean), have responsibility",63
NA,for further developing Australia's approach to,63
NA,"the convention, bearing in mind the particular",63
NA,Australian interests arising from our fossil,63
NA,fuel dependency and unique natural environ-,63
NA,ment. We will continue to participate actively,63
NA,in the further development of the convention,63
NA,and in the bodies set up to guide its imple-,63
NA,"mentation. In doing so, we shall draw upon",63
NA,emerging scientific infonnation on climate,63
NA,change and its impacts.,63
NA,The Government has decided upon a broad,63
NA,set of objectives for this phase of negotiations,63
NA,on the development of the convention. These,63
NA,are based on well-known policies that have,63
NA,provided consistent guidance in fonnulating,63
NA,Australia's national. and international respones,63
NA,on climate change.,63
NA,The Government believes development of,63
NA,the convention should proceed in a manner,63
NA,that acknowledges the important principles,63
NA,"already embedded in the convention, such as",63
NA,the need for a comprehensive approach to,63
NA,"limiting all greenhouse gas emissions, as well",63
NA,as enhancing and protecting greenhouse gas,63
NA,sinks; the need for equitable burden sharing,64
NA,amongst countries that takes into account the,64
NA,special circumstances of individual countries;,64
NA,the importance of increasing our -owledge,64
NA,about the science and potential impacts of,64
NA,climate change; a strong commitment to,64
NA,public education; and the importance of,64
NA,global action.,64
NA,The first conference of parties is expected,64
NA,to beheld early in 1995. In this phase of,64
NA,"negotiations, leading up to the first conference",64
NA,"of parties, Australia sees as the immediate",64
NA,priority the need to identify and gain agree-,64
NA,ment to mechanisms to implement the com-,64
NA,mitments currently contained in the conven-,64
NA,tion. Some of the implementation details still,64
NA,to be decided include issues of significant,64
NA,importance to Australia.,64
NA,These include agreement·on guidelines for,64
NA,countries to jointly implement emissions,64
NA,"commitments, and agreement on an inventory",64
NA,methodology that allows all greenhouse gas,64
NA,emissions and sink activities to be measured.,64
NA,"Within Australia, the Commonwealth",64
NA,"Government, working with the States and",64
NA,"local government, has already put in place the",64
NA,mechanisms neceSsary to give effect to our,64
NA,convention obligations. These include the,64
NA,national greenhouse response strategy; the,64
NA,framework for action provided by the,64
NA,intergovernmental agreement oh the environ-,64
NA,"ment, which was concluded in 1992; a pro-",64
NA,gram of scientific research; and the develop-,64
NA,ment of a national inventory of greenhouse,64
NA,gases.,64
NA,The first phase of the national greenhouse,64
NA,response strategy was endorsed by heads of,64
NA,government in December. That first phase,64
NA,concentrates on 'no regrets' measures-in,64
NA,"other words, those measures that have net",64
NA,"benefits, or at least no net cost, in addition",64
NA,"addressing the greenhouse effect, and that are",64
NA,therefore worth doing .in their own right.,64
NA,These include: improving the efficiency of,64
NA,energy production and use; diversifying our,64
NA,sources of energy; developing sustainable and,64
NA,greenhouse effective agricultural practices;,64
NA,improving our national transport system;,64
NA,better urban planning; natural environment,64
NA,conservation; research into climate change;,64
NA,and community information and education.,64
NA,The national greenhouse response strategy,64
NA,is based on the Australian interim planning,64
NA,target on greenhouse gas emissions which we,64
NA,"adopted in 1990, and which the Prime",64
NA,Minister reaffirmed in his environtnent state-,64
NA,ment in December 1992. Our target aims to,64
NA,"stabilise emissions of greenhoU$e gases, based",64
NA,"on 1988 levels, by the year 2000 and to",64
NA,reduce these emissions by 20 per cent by the,64
NA,year 2005.,64
NA,. The Government also holds to its decision,64
NA,"that, while recognising the need to restrict",64
NA,"greenhouse gas emissions, Australia will not",64
NA,proceed with the adoption of response meas-,64
NA,ures which would have net adverse economic,64
NA,impacts nationally or· on Australia's trade,64
NA,"competitive-ess, in the absence of similar",64
NA,action by major greenhouse gas producing,64
NA,countries. In that context I note the announce-,64
NA,ment by US President Clinton on 21 April,64
NA,that the US would be adopting a policy to,64
NA,stabilise greenhouse gas emissions. This,64
NA,"means that all OECD countries, with the",64
NA,"exception of Turkey, have now adopted",64
NA,national greenhouse gas emission targets.,64
NA,The US also pledged to provide to the next,64
NA,convention negotiating session in August a,64
NA,report on domestic actions planned to give,64
NA,effect to its commitments under the conven-,64
NA,tion. Let me also say that I welcome the,64
NA,stated intention of the US to pursue a vigo-,64
NA,rous and progressive environment policy both,64
NA,domestically and internationally.,64
NA,We have already transmitted to the climate,64
NA,change convention negotiators Australia's,64
NA,interim report on the measures we have taken,64
NA,consistent with the convention. For this,64
NA,purpose the national greenhouse response,64
NA,strategy formed Australia's interim report. I,64
NA,am pleased to report that last Saturday the,64
NA,to environment Ministers of all Australian,64
NA,"governments, State and Commonwealth",64
NA,"together, endorsed a work program to imple-",64
NA,ment a range of measures contained in the,64
NA,national greenhouse response strategy. I,64
NA,understand that similar work plans are being,64
NA,developed and implemented by a range of,64
NA,agencies and bodies responsible for making,64
NA,the first phase of the strategy a success.,64
NA,"Of course, implementing our national",64
NA,greenhouse response strategy is not the only,64
NA,means of addressing our convention obliga-,65
NA,tions. Initiatives such as the one billion trees,65
NA,"program, the national soil conservation pro-",65
NA,"gram, the national electricity grid, the build-",65
NA,"ing better cities program, our ecologically",65
NA,sustainable development strategy and the,65
NA,national forest policy statement all contribute,65
NA,to achieving our greenhouse goals.,65
NA,The challenges and opportunities presented,65
NA,by greenhouse-induced climate change are,65
NA,"real and highly significant for Australia, as",65
NA,they are for the entire global community. I do,65
NA,not underestimate the adjustment issues we,65
NA,are facing. The very public debate that has,65
NA,occurred over the last few years is evidence,65
NA,of the valid concerns and different viewpoints,65
NA,about the amount and speed of adjustment,65
NA,needed. The Government's policies explicitly,65
NA,recognise these adjustment issues. And I,65
NA,believe that with genuine cooperation and,65
NA,"goodwill on all sides, and with acknowledg-",65
NA,"ment of others' interests, the challenges can",65
NA,indeed be met.,65
NA,There are also significant opportunities. Our,65
NA,comprehensive and strategic approach to both,65
NA,our international and domestic obligations,65
NA,gives rise to opportunities for industry and for,65
NA,the nation. Renewable forms of energy are an,65
NA,area of real opportunity for investment and,65
NA,employment that Australia is well placed to,65
NA,exploit. Australia is already at the forefront,65
NA,the development of solar technologies and,65
NA,renewable transport fuels.,65
NA,There is a similar story to tell for the,65
NA,biodiversity convention. The biodiversity,65
NA,convention recognises the global imperative,65
NA,in the conservation and sustainable use of,65
NA,"species, genetic resources and ecosystems for",65
NA,the benefit of present and future generations.,65
NA,It too was signed in Rio by over 150 count-,65
NA,"ries. Again, Australia played a leading role in",65
NA,the development of the convention and is,65
NA,continuing to play a key role in its implemen-,65
NA,"tation both internationally and, more specifi-",65
NA,"cally, in the Asia-Pacific region. Australia",65
NA,considers it vital to maintain the impetus for,65
NA,the convention's early entry into force and,65
NA,implementation and I am encouraging other,65
NA,countries to take action in this regard.,65
NA,I was greatly encouraged when President,65
NA,Clinton announced the US intention to sign,65
NA,the convention and that the US would be,65
NA,taking a prominent role in global actions to,65
NA,conserve biodiversity. The Australian Govern-,65
NA,ment welcomes the US initiative which will,65
NA,provide added momentum to the global effort.,65
NA,I see this as another example of US commit- .,65
NA,"ment, vision and leadership on these vital",65
NA,issues.,65
NA,The convention needs 30 ratifications for it,65
NA,to come into effect. We believe that the,65
NA,necessary number 'will be reached during,65
NA,1994. Our own ratification of the convention,65
NA,was foreshadowed in the Prime Minister's,65
NA,environment statement in December. M 0 s t,65
NA,States have now responded favourably to the,65
NA,Commonwealth's proposal to ratify the con-,65
NA,vention. We will be in a position to. ratify,65
NA,following final consideration of the conven-,65
NA,tion at the meeting of the Council of Austral-,65
NA,ian Governments in June.,65
NA,The Government is firmly committed to the,65
NA,development of a national strategy on biologi-,65
NA,cal diversity with a view to developing a,65
NA,"biodiversity program. A Commonwealth, State",65
NA,and Territory task force is currently in the,65
NA,process of finalising a draft. The process has,65
NA,involved extensive consultation with a wide,65
NA,range of interest groups and the public-from,65
NA,Government at all levels to business and,65
NA,"in industry, the scientific community and the",65
NA,conservation movement.,65
NA,I view the strategy as a key element for,65
NA,implementing the Government's environment,65
NA,policy. It will be available for consideration,65
NA,by governments. within the next few months,65
NA,and will hopefully be adopted by the end of,65
NA,this year. The strategy will provide an effec-,65
NA,"tive framework, involving all sectors of the",65
NA,"community, for achieving biological conserva-",65
NA,tion goals. It proposes a mix of short-and,65
NA,"long-term actions on conservation, sustainable",65
NA,"use, the management of threats, improving",65
NA,knowledge and community involvement. The,65
NA,strategy and the subsequent program will be,65
NA,two of the major measures for implementing,65
NA,our obligations under the convention. They,65
NA,will strengthen and add to the wide range of,65
NA,current Commonwealth programs in the area,65
NA,of nature conservation and biological protec-,65
NA,tion.,65
NA,Australia is in a unique position. We are the,66
NA,only developed country which is also,66
NA,"megadiverse. Many of our primary industries,",66
NA,"essential to our export earnings, are dependent",66
NA,either directly or indirectly on our biological,66
NA,diversity and that of other countries. It is,66
NA,"therefore in Australia's interests, environmentment",66
NA,"al and economic, to take strong and decisive",66
NA,actions to conserve biological diversity and to,66
NA,maximise the benefits to be gained. Aust-,66
NA,ralia's leadership in this field creates oppor-,66
NA,tunities. Not only are we maximising the,66
NA,benefits to be gained from a well-managed,66
NA,"and conserved natural heritage, but the com-",66
NA,mercial opportunities are also highly signifi-,66
NA,"cant. Australia possesses significant expertise,",66
NA,"in both the private and public sectors, in",66
NA,"biological research, assessment and manage-",66
NA,"ment, as well as in associated and enabling",66
NA,"techniques and technologies, such as remote",66
NA,sensing. The potential benefits of using our,66
NA,"own genetic resources in areas of science,",66
NA,medicine and agriculture are enormous.,66
NA,I tum now to the Earth Summit's action,66
NA,plan for sustainable development in the 21st,66
NA,century-agenda 21. Agenda 21 is a truly,66
NA,massive document-40 chapters covering,66
NA,"matters as diverse as poverty, population,",66
NA,"technology transfer, consumption patterns,",66
NA,"forests, freshwater, pollution avoidance,",66
NA,"transboundary air pollution, and radioactive",66
NA,"waste. It is a blueprint or set of guidelines,",66
NA,"not just for individual countries but, import-",66
NA,"antly, for the entire United Nations system as",66
NA,well as for individuals and organisations of,66
NA,every size and type. Australia contributed,66
NA,significantly to its preparation and negotia-,66
NA,tions. The adoption of agenda 21 at the Rio,66
NA,summit marks an important step in global,66
NA,cooperation on environment and development,66
NA,matters. While agenda 21 does not impose,66
NA,"binding legal commitments on governments,",66
NA,we will be doing our best to ensure that it is,66
NA,"adopted in Australia, provided of course that",66
NA,individual activities proposed accord with our,66
NA,domestic economic interests and international,66
NA,priorities for sustainable development.,66
NA,Essentially the process for implementing,66
NA,agenda 21 will be one of analysing the recom-,66
NA,"mendations, assessing their relevance and",66
NA,applicability to Australia and ensuring that the,66
NA,high priority recommendations are being acted,66
NA,upon through existing programs and institu-,66
NA,tions. The recommendations of agenda 21,66
NA,cover a wide range of issues and responsibili-,66
NA,"ties for implementation, cutting across virtual-",66
NA,ly every Commonwealth and State govern-,66
NA,agency as well as local government and,66
NA,the non-government sector. It will be neces-,66
NA,sary to ensure that all of these parties have,66
NA,input to the process. My department has the,66
NA,responsibility for the overall coordination of,66
NA,"the domestic follow-up of agenda 21, al-",66
NA,though other agencies will have a more direct,66
NA,implementation task. It is not envisaged that,66
NA,a major new process will be required on the,66
NA,part of Australia to implement agenda 21.,66
NA,There are already a number of processes and,66
NA,mechanisms which will make a major contri-,66
NA,bution to its implementation.,66
NA,Chief among them will be the consultative,66
NA,arrangements established under the 1992,66
NA,intergovernmental agreement on the environ-,66
NA,ment and the processes under the Govern-,66
NA,ment's ecologically sustainable development,66
NA,"policy, which brought together government,",66
NA,"industry, unions and broad based community",66
NA,representatives to report on the policies and,66
NA,structures necessary to achieve ESD· in Aus-,66
NA,tralia. The preparation of national sustainable,66
NA,development strategies or plans is a key,66
NA,recommendation of agenda 21 and I believe,66
NA,Australia's own ESD strategy is already being,66
NA,seen as something of a model. During my,66
NA,"visit to Washington, for example, I found",66
NA,keen interest in our experience amongst the,66
NA,members of the Administration I spoke with.,66
NA,A key feature of this Government's ap-,66
NA,proach to the development of policies on,66
NA,international environment and sustainable,66
NA,development issues has been community,66
NA,consultation. Following the Earth Summit and,66
NA,the conclusion of the two conventions we,66
NA,recognised that past practices and methods,66
NA,would need to be upgraded and given new,66
NA,life. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and I,66
NA,have decided to formalise and enhance a,66
NA,process to receive the views of the non-,66
NA,government community on these very import-,66
NA,ant international environment issues. An,66
NA,international environment non-government,66
NA,organisations consultative forum has now,66
NA,been established and will meet for the first,67
NA,time on Friday this week. Its 17 members,67
NA,"comprise senior representatives of business,",67
NA,"environment, aid and community groups. I am",67
NA,pleased to announce that the forum will be,67
NA,chaired by our friend and colleague the,67
NA,"honourable member for Werriwa ( Mr Kerin),",67
NA,who brings to the position a unique blend of,67
NA,personal experience and commitment. His task,67
NA,will be a challenging one and one which,67
NA,Senator Evans and I very much value and,67
NA,appreciate.,67
NA,Our efforts to give effect to the internation-,67
NA,al obligations arising from the two conven-,67
NA,tions and the imperatives of agenda 21 are,67
NA,closely linked to the many other domestic,67
NA,environment initiatives and policies of this,67
NA,"Government, in particular, the initiatives",67
NA,announced through both the Prime Minister's,67
NA,December 1992 environment statement and,67
NA,the March 1993 election statement on the,67
NA,environment. Both statements recognise the,67
NA,"important, indeed essential, part the environ-",67
NA,ment has to play in Australia's growth.,67
NA,The initiatives revolve around the key role,67
NA,"of ecologically sustainable development,",67
NA,recognising as they do the need to conserve,67
NA,and preserve our stock and use the income,67
NA,"wisely for future generations, rather than",67
NA,depleting our assets for short-term gain.,67
NA,Examples such as the acquisition of the,67
NA,"Calperum pastoral lease, feral animal and",67
NA,"weed control, the cleaner production demon-",67
NA,"stration program, a national halon bank and",67
NA,national state of the environment reporting,67
NA,show that this Government will not be slow,67
NA,in taking the necessary environmental deci-,67
NA,sions where they are central to the issue of,67
NA,Australia's development as a nation. Each,67
NA,initiative also helps to build our domestic,67
NA,response to the conventions and to agenda 21.,67
NA,One of the key outcomes of the summit was,67
NA,its recognition of the need to build interna-,67
NA,tional partnerships for sustainable develop-,67
NA,"ment, partnerships between developed and",67
NA,developing countries and between the devel-,67
NA,"oping countries themselves. Of course, well",67
NA,before UNCED Australia was focusing atten-,67
NA,tion on our immediate region. The summit,67
NA,and the processes leading up to it gave a,67
NA,considerable boost to the environmental,67
NA,dimension of that relationship.,67
NA,Australia has been actively expanding its,67
NA,"environmental cooperation with Asia, espe-",67
NA,cially with the members of ASEAN. I have,67
NA,signed bilateral arrangements with Indonesia,67
NA,and Singapore and there have been exchanges,67
NA,of ministerial visits. Discussions are under,67
NA,way with senior officials of ASEAN member,67
NA,countries to establish cooperative arrange-,67
NA,ments that address regional environmental,67
NA,issues. Negotiations have begun with China,67
NA,on a memorandum of understanding.,67
NA,The Commonwealth Environment Protection,67
NA,Agency has participated in a number of,67
NA,environmental exhibitions in countries in the,67
NA,"region. It has run, in close conjunction with",67
NA,"the environmental industries, environmental",67
NA,"workshops and seminars with Korea, Taiwan",67
NA,and Singapore and is planning to run similar,67
NA,activities in Indonesia in the near future.,67
NA,These types of activities on issues such as,67
NA,"pollution avoidance, environmental technolo-",67
NA,"gies, standards setting and environmental",67
NA,"impact assessment will continue to increase,",67
NA,particularly in the South-East Asian region.,67
NA,Australia also contributes to climate change,67
NA,and related studies being undertaken or,67
NA,planned in the Asia region. One current study,67
NA,is the Asian Development Bank regional,67
NA,study on global environment issues. It is an,67
NA,eight-country project financed by the govern-,67
NA,"ments of Australia, Japan and Norway. Aus-",67
NA,"tralia has provided $500,000, approximately",67
NA,one-third of the total funding.,67
NA,Closely allied to the issue of conservation,67
NA,of biological diversity is the urgent need to,67
NA,reduce the rate of global deforestation. The,67
NA,UNCED statement of forest principles pro-,67
NA,vides direction for addressing this issue in the,67
NA,broadest social and economic context. We are,67
NA,committed to continuing our work in interna-,67
NA,tional fora in order to find ways in which to,67
NA,reduce the rate of deforestation and to facili-,67
NA,tate the conservation and ecological sustain-,67
NA,able use of forests.,67
NA,"Another project, originally known as the",67
NA,regional program for the development of,67
NA,least-cost greenhouse emissions reduction,67
NA,"plans in Asia, is planned to begin this year",67
NA,through the global environment facility and,67
NA,the UN development program. Australia will,68
NA,be contributing about one-third of the total,68
NA,budget of $9 million. Australia is also con-,68
NA,sidering co-financing the global environment,68
NA,facility project on east Asian seas.,68
NA,Under the development assistance program,68
NA,Australia has committed expenditure totalling,68
NA,nearly $200 million over four years for,68
NA,environmental activities in ASEAN member,68
NA,countries. 1\\'0 major regional projects which,68
NA,Australia is supporting are an $8.4 million,68
NA,marine science project and a $5.3 million,68
NA,energy project. We expect that our regional,68
NA,involvement through the ASEAN-Australia,68
NA,economic cooperation program will include a,68
NA,substantial environmental component in its,68
NA,next phase which starts in 1994.,68
NA,There is also a wide range of bilateral,68
NA,environmental projects with countries of the,68
NA,"region. For example, in Indonesia alone",68
NA,Australia is funding seven projects totalling,68
NA,$122.7 million. In the Pacific region the focus,68
NA,has been on support for the South Pacific,68
NA,"regional environment program, or SPREP, and",68
NA,on individual high priority projects in the,68
NA,developing island countries. Australia is a,68
NA,major supporter of SPREP. In 1992-93 a total,68
NA,of $1.8 million was provided by Australia.,68
NA,Australia has played an important role in,68
NA,the South Pacific on biodiversity issues. We,68
NA,assisted Pacific island countries to develop a,68
NA,regional position on biological diversity and,68
NA,to be represented at negotiating sessions on,68
NA,the convention. Many of the Pacific island,68
NA,countries have signed the convention and,68
NA,Australia is providing advice on ratification.,68
NA,We have also played an active role in,68
NA,developing the South Pacific biodiversity,68
NA,"project, a $10 million global environment",68
NA,facility project which Australia will be co-,68
NA,financing. The project aims to conserve,68
NA,biodiversity in the region through the estab-,68
NA,"lishment of multiple use conservation areas,",68
NA,drawing heavily on the skills and knowledge,68
NA,of traditional owners and users of biodiversity,68
NA,in the region.,68
NA,Australia also supported the participation,68
NA,the Pacific island countries in negotiating on,68
NA,the climate change convention. An Australian,68
NA,funded feasibility study on climate monitoring,68
NA,and impacts in the south-west Pacific arose,68
NA,from concerns about the impact of the green-,68
NA,house effect raised at the 1988 meeting of the,68
NA,"South Pacific Forum. This study, which was",68
NA,undertaken by the World Meteorological,68
NA,"Organisation, is described in the report The",68
NA,changing climate in paradise published by the,68
NA,Australian Bureau of Meteorology. I recom-,68
NA,mend it to people.,68
NA,In listing what Australia is doing in our,68
NA,region to give effect to the Earth Summit,68
NA,"outcomes, I am not suggesting that we are the",68
NA,only players in the process. But Australia's,68
NA,efforts over the past few years are indicative,68
NA,of the types of changes and new programs,68
NA,already in the pipeline. Recent announce-,68
NA,"ments by other donors, such as Japan and the",68
NA,"US, have clearly indicated that they too see",68
NA,their bilateral and regional assistance pro-,68
NA,grams being increasingly supportive and,68
NA,complementary to global efforts in sustainable,68
NA,development and as adjuncts to convention,68
NA,funding.,68
NA,"I will now describe briefly, for the benefit",68
NA,"of honourable members, the key actions",68
NA,which have been taken by the United Nations,68
NA,at the global level to give effect to the out-,68
NA,comes of the Earth Summit. The key player,68
NA,in starting the follow-up to UNCED was the,68
NA,"UN General Assembly. At its 1992 session,",68
NA,the General Assembly examined the UNCED,68
NA,outcomes and established certain directions,68
NA,and priorities. The General Assembly wel-,68
NA,comed the finalisation of the conventions and,68
NA,urged countries which had not signed them in,68
NA,Rio to do so soon. The General Assembly,68
NA,also urged ratification and a prompt start to,68
NA,both the climate change and biological di-,68
NA,versity conventions.,68
NA,The General Assembly then looked at,68
NA,agenda 21 as the principle action document,68
NA,from UNCED and identified a number of,68
NA,issues or recommendations requiring immedi-,68
NA,ate action. It took action to establish a com-,68
NA,mission for sustainable development as a,68
NA,senior body within the UN system. The,68
NA,establishment of the commission was a centre-,68
NA,of piece of agenda 21. The commission has been,68
NA,formally established and will now meet,68
NA,annually in June. The main role of the com-,68
NA,mission will be to monitor the implementation,68
NA,of agenda 21. Countries are expected to,68
NA,provide reports on their own efforts and the,69
NA,"operational agencies of the UN system,such",69
NA,"as the UN development program, the Food",69
NA,and Agriculture Organisation and the UN,69
NA,"environment program, as well as organisations",69
NA,"such as the World Bank, will be reporting to",69
NA,the commission on their own efforts to give,69
NA,effect to the recommendations of agenda 21.,69
NA,The commission will ultimately report to,69
NA,the General Assembly and to the UN Secre-,69
NA,tary-General on that process. It will be ex-,69
NA,pected to make recommendations on overcom-,69
NA,ing problems or gaps in implementation and,69
NA,will actually review agenda 21 in 1997.,69
NA,Australia was elected to the 53-member,69
NA,commission for a two-year tenn. At its first,69
NA,"meeting in June this year, the commission",69
NA,will be establishing a work program to thor-,69
NA,oughly review the implementation of agenda,69
NA,21 over the next four years. A system of,69
NA,national reporting will be a fundamental,69
NA,element of that work program. Countries will,69
NA,be asked to provide detailed reports to the,69
NA,commission on their domestic efforts to,69
NA,achieve sustainable development and the,69
NA,commission will be monitoring and reporting,69
NA,on national progress.,69
NA,The other key elements in the General,69
NA,Assembly'S decisions on UNCED related to,69
NA,the immediate establishment of three import-,69
NA,ant international processes which could not,69
NA,wait until the commission was established and,69
NA,"operating. Those processes were: firstly, the",69
NA,establishment of a special intergovernmental,69
NA,negotiating committee to develop an interna-,69
NA,tional convention on desertification. The,69
NA,primary focus of the negotiations is,69
NA,international consensus on the measures,69
NA,needed to deal with the problems of land,69
NA,degradation in those countries experiencing,69
NA,"drought and/or desertification, particularly",69
NA,Africa.,69
NA,"Secondly, the General Assembly also",69
NA,established a special conference to deal with,69
NA,problems of management of high seas fisher-,69
NA,"ies, notably the problems of managing the",69
NA,exploitation of highly migratory species and,69
NA,species which straddle the 200-mile exclusive,69
NA,economic zones of coastal states. A third,69
NA,process was also a conference on the particU-,69
NA,lar problems of small island states. UNCED,69
NA,recognised that small island states face very,69
NA,special problems in their efforts to achieve,69
NA,sustainable development.,69
NA,The preparations for that conference have,69
NA,already commeIlcl(d in earnest and involve,69
NA,most of the island countries of the South,69
NA,"Pacific, the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean.",69
NA,"Australia's Ambassador for the Environment,",69
NA,"Penny Wensley, is chairing the committee",69
NA,which will prepare for the final conference in,69
NA,Barbados in 1994. The Commission for,69
NA,Sustainable Development will no doubt,69
NA,identify other key issues and processes. There,69
NA,"is, for example, already some talk of further",69
NA,action being required on the issue of forest,69
NA,management and conservation as a follow-up,69
NA,to the statement of forest principles and also,69
NA,on the issue of fresh water.,69
NA,"Apart from the UN, there are a few other",69
NA,"key players worthy of mention, in particular",69
NA,"the global environment facility. The GEF, as",69
NA,"it is called, is a joint project of the World",69
NA,"Bank, UNEP and UNDP and was established",69
NA,in 1990 with around $US1.5 billion of donor,69
NA,funds specifically to help developing countries,69
NA,undertake projects to deal with global envi-,69
NA,ronmental issues. The GEF is already per-,69
NA,forming an interim role for the conventions by,69
NA,funding activities such as the country,69
NA,biodiversity studies and the greenhouse gas,69
NA,inventories as well as providing funds for,69
NA,large-scale conservation and energy efficiency,69
NA,or conversion programs in developing count-,69
NA,ries. The GEF will be refonned and replen-,69
NA,ished this year so that it is capable of taking,69
NA,on the extra roles allocated to it once the,69
NA,to achieve conventions come into force.,69
NA,Australia committed $30 million to the pilot,69
NA,"phase of the GEF, which ends this year, and",69
NA,is an active participant in the replenishment,69
NA,in negotiations. That replenishment is likely to,69
NA,expand even further the scope for technology,69
NA,transfer and funding assistance for developing,69
NA,countries in our own region. Current papers,69
NA,"on the replenishment suggest that a doubling,",69
NA,"or even more, of the pilot phase funding level",69
NA,to around $5 billion may be achievable.,69
NA,I have now outlined the actions being,69
NA,"undertaken at the national, regional and global",69
NA,levels to give effect to the outcomes of the,69
NA,Earth Summit. I will now conclude with a,69
NA,few words about our priorities for the future.,70
NA,"Clearly, the actions I have described must",70
NA,inevitably be regarded as work in progress.,70
NA,Nothing is finished. Our first priority must,70
NA,to see that the conventions come into force,70
NA,and are operating effectively as soon as,70
NA,"possible, that our national strategies are",70
NA,"progressing effectively and are implemented,",70
NA,and that the framework provided by agenda,70
NA,"21, the ESD strategy and the initiatives of the",70
NA,Prime Minister's environment statements are,70
NA,given full effect.,70
NA,Our regional program will be strengthened,70
NA,and we will be working within the Commis-,70
NA,"sion for Sustainable Development, the UN",70
NA,environment program and the global environ-,70
NA,ment facility to ensure a rapid and effective,70
NA,uptake of the summit's priority recommenda-,70
NA,"tions. Regionally, we will continue to build",70
NA,partnerships with the countries of our immedi-,70
NA,ate region and with countries such as the US,70
NA,and Germany where strategic alliances can,70
NA,advance our international objectives.,70
NA,"During this, my second, term as environ-",70
NA,"ment Minister, I will be pursuing a number of",70
NA,key priorities both domestically and interna-,70
NA,tionally. Issues of the state of our urban,70
NA,"environment, touching as they do the lives of",70
NA,"most Australians, must be a key area for",70
NA,"action. Lead in petrol, energy production and",70
NA,"use, pollution avoidance, urban transport and",70
NA,environmental health are some of tile matters,70
NA,I am committed to addressing. I will also be,70
NA,actively pursuing the Government's policies,70
NA,"in the area of nature conservation, including",70
NA,"our protected areas policy, and ensuring that",70
NA,there is a national reserves system and rapid,70
NA,implementation of the Commonwealth's,70
NA,endangered species legislation in conjunction,70
NA,with the continuation of the endangered,70
NA,species program.,70
NA,"New issues arise continually. As a nation,",70
NA,we must be prepared to meet the challenges,70
NA,posed and to create the opportunities for,70
NA,environmental and economic gain. The sea,70
NA,change that we are seeing in the international,70
NA,community has its roots in the realisation,70
NA,environment IUld economic policies can and,70
NA,must be mutually supporting. Areas such as,70
NA,"trade, employment and fiscal policy, and even",70
NA,subjects as basic as the measurement of our,70
NA,"GOP, are increasingly concerned with envi-",70
NA,ronmental impacts and environmental better-,70
NA,ment. Environmental policy can assist in,70
NA,be removing barriers to greater economic effi-,70
NA,ciency and can be a driving force behind,70
NA,many micrQ-economic reforms. International,70
NA,competitiveness and high environmental,70
NA,standards are not incompatible. They are two,70
NA,sides of the same coin.,70
NA,In a world which cooperates in the area of,70
NA,"environmental goal setting and management,",70
NA,"free trade and s""UStainable development can be",70
NA,mutually supportive. That means development,70
NA,and jobs-jobs in environmentally sustainable,70
NA,industries from all sectors and new jobs in,70
NA,industries providing the technology and,70
NA,services to clean up the environment. These,70
NA,new industries are export oriented from the,70
NA,outset and are supported by the increasing,70
NA,level of international cooperation on the,70
NA,environment and by Australia's pro-active and,70
NA,progressive role in international forums.,70
NA,This integration of environmental .and,70
NA,economic policy is the wave of the future. I,70
NA,"will be giving increased attention to, and",70
NA,"upgrading my portfolio's capabilities in, the",70
NA,"field of environmental economics, resource",70
NA,accounting and state of the environment,70
NA,reporting so that we are better placed as a,70
NA,nation to reap both the environmental and,70
NA,economic benefits of sound policies-the,70
NA,fundamental goal of ecologically sustainable,70
NA,development. I present a copy of my,70
NA,ministerial statement.,70
NA,Motion (by Mr Beddall) proposed:,70
NA,That the House take note of the paper.,70
NA,Motion (by Mr Beddall)-by leave-,70
NA,agreed to:,70

NA,able member for Hindmarsh speaking for a period,70
NA,not exceeding 32 minutes.,70
Mrs GALLUS ,Hindmarsh) (3.45 p.m.)-,70
NA,Last year the United Nations convened a,70
NA,world conference in Rio de Janeiro called the,70
NA,United Nations Conference on the Environ-,70
NA,"that ment and Development, better known as the",70
NA,Earth Summit. At the conclusion of this,70
NA,"conference, most of the nations of the world",70
NA,"signed the Rio declaration, which is a com-",70
NA,mitment to a set of principles requiring,70
NA,development to be sensitive to the environ-,71
NA,ment. The Earth Summit also endorsed agen-,71
NA,"da 21, a wide-ranging program of national",71
NA,and international actions to be taken by its,71
NA,principals into the 21st century. During the,71
NA,"summit, Australia signed the conventions on",71
NA,climate change and biological diversity. In her,71
NA,"speech today, the Minister for the Environ-",71
NA,"ment, Sport and Territories ( Mrs Kelly)",71
NA,addressed the responses the Government has,71
NA,taken to give effect to these two conventions,71
NA,and to agenda 21.,71
NA,"Firstly, I will deal with climate change.",71
NA,"climate change convention, which 153 count-",71
NA,"ries signed, is an agreement to act together",71
NA,with all other nations to reduce the production,71
NA,of greenhouse gases. The coalition strongly,71
NA,supports the signing of this convention and its,71
NA,aims. We support government action to,71
NA,"inform the community, industry, State and",71
NA,local governments of the implications of,71
NA,"increasing amounts of carbon dioxide, me-",71
NA,thane and CFCs in the atmosphere.,71
NA,"As part of the coalition's election policy,",71
NA,we stressed the importance of reducing green-,71
NA,"house emissions from government, industry",71
NA,and the home;·the need for better use of our,71
NA,"natural resources; in substituting, where",71
NA,"appropriate, renewable for non-renewable",71
NA,"resources, including the greater use of solar",71
NA,power and natural light; improving the effi-,71
NA,ciency to conversion from primary industry,71
NA,"sources such as coal, oil and gas to end use",71
NA,"energy such as electricity, petrol and diesel",71
NA,"fuel; and, finally, and very importantly,",71
NA,improving the layout of our cities in ways,71
NA,that reduce energy use in transport and other,71
NA,services.,71
NA,In her speech the Minister said that the,71
NA,Labor Government has already put in place,71
NA,the mechanisms necessary to give effect to the,71
NA,national greenhouse response strategy. In this,71
NA,regard the Government's actions do not,71
NA,always match its rhetoric. In October 1990 as,71
NA,an interim response to the threat of global,71
NA,warming the Government announced an,71
NA,energy efficiency package which could be,71
NA,implemented immediately to save on energy,71
NA,"use in Australia. However, in a report tabled",71
NA,"in Parliament on 18 May this year, the Aus-",71
NA,tralian National Audit Office concluded that,71
NA,in regard to the 1990 announcement insuffi-,71
NA,cient implementary action had been taken. In,71
NA,"particular, the Government's own operations",71
NA,had failed to set an example. I would like to,71
NA,quote from the report of the Australian Na-,71
NA,tional Audit Office:,71
NA,The department's own research has shown that the,71
NA,Government was seen to be asking for action by,71
NA,other energy consumers but was not active in,71
NA,improving its own energy use.,71
NA,The report said that the Federal Government,71
NA,can hardly expect prompt responses from the,71
NA,The community to increase energy efficiency in,71
NA,curbing greenhouse gas emissions when it was,71
NA,dragging its own feet. The report said that,71
NA,after two years the department given the,71
NA,responsibility for responding to the green-,71
NA,house agenda-,71
Mrs KELLY ,Which department?,71
Mrs GALLUS,The Department of Pri-,71
NA,mary Industries and Energy-was one year,71
NA,behind what was achievable. The report went,71
NA,on to say that manufacturing industry had,71
NA,"been neglected, although there was scope to",71
NA,greatly expand understanding of energy use in,71
NA,"the home, in transport and in commercial",71
NA,"buildings, and also there was a lack of coordi-",71
NA,nation on energy ratings and standards for,71
NA,appliances and buildings. I think an important,71
NA,point to make is that it is very nice to have,71
NA,all these strategies but when we give depart-,71
NA,ments the job of implementing the strategies,71
NA,"something has to be done, and it has to be",71
NA,done reasonably quickly.,71
NA,The Minister is inclined to make statements,71
NA,about Australia's lead on environmental issues,71
NA,including greenhouse. The. truth is that per,71
NA,person Australia sends more greenhouse gases,71
NA,into the atmosphere than any other Western,71
NA,"country. At 11 tonnes per person, Australia",71
NA,emits more greenhouse gases per person per,71
NA,annum than the United States at 10 tonnes,71
NA,and three times as much as Japan with three,71
NA,tonnes. I think most Australians would be,71
NA,somewhat stunned to note that.,71
NA,"However, in making this observation I wish",71
NA,to note that Australia has many energy-inten-,71
NA,sive industries which add to our greenhouse,71
NA,"gases. For instance, the Japanese use our",71
NA,"aluminium, but we smelt· it here and the",71
NA,greenhouse gas emissions are added to our,71
NA,total rather than that of the Japanese who are,72
NA,the end users. Acknowledging the dependence,72
NA,"of Australia on energy intensive industries, we",72
NA,still cannot take the state of our greenhouse,72
NA,"emissions lightly, and I would ask the",72
NA,Minister to address this problem as a matter,72
NA,of urgency.,72
NA,It gives me no pleasure to point out that,72
NA,Australia's exhaust emission standards are,72
NA,more like those of a Third World country.,72
NA,Our cars are allowed to spew twice as many,72
NA,"hydrocarbons into the air as US cars, and",72
NA,three times as many as Japanese cars. I would,72
NA,ask the Minister to perhaps follow up on this,72
NA,with our car companies to see what they are,72
NA,"best able to do, and I myself have already",72
NA,initiated conversations with Mitsubishi on this,72
NA,very issue.,72
NA,At present there appears to be a great deal,72
NA,of attention in the climate change section of,72
NA,the Minister's department focused upon,72
NA,international aspects of greenhouse-and the,72
NA,Minister. referred to that in her speech. As,72
NA,"desirable as this may be, I ask the Minister",72
NA,whether this is a wise use of our limited,72
NA,resources when to date so little has been done,72
NA,in Australia to explore the extent of the,72
NA,problem and to address the possible impact on,72
NA,"our shores and coastal towns. In future, in the",72
NA,"matter of greenhouse, I would like to see a",72
NA,statement by the Minister identifying potential,72
NA,areas of risks on possible sea level rise.,72
NA,In international negotiations on the environcommitment,72
NA,ment can the Minister ensure that Australia's,72
NA,competitive position is given due regard? The,72
NA,Minister's desire to make an international,72
NA,"impact is understandable. However, if the end",72
NA,result is that Australia lowers her competitive,72
NA,position in regard to other nations while they,72
NA,pursue their own economic agenda at the,72
NA,"expense of environmental issues, then Austral-",72
NA,ia will be the loser.,72
NA,Poor economies are in no position to ad-,72
NA,dress the large number of environmental,72
NA,issues that they have to face. Australia has a,72
NA,large number of such issues: desertification;,72
NA,the degradation of the Murray-Darling Basin;,72
NA,soil erosion; and dry land salinity being only,72
NA,a few. We need a strong economy and a good,72
NA,trading position to address these problems.,72
NA,The coalition welcomes the Minister's com-,72
NA,mitment to addressing the problems of green-,72
NA,house and looks forward to the detail about,72
NA,implementation of the greenhouse strategy.,72
NA,I turn now to the biodiversity convention in,72
NA,which the Minister noted that Australia played,72
NA,a leading role in the development of the,72
NA,convention and is continuing to play a key,72
NA,role in its implementation both internationally,72
NA,"and, more specifically, in the Asia-Pacific",72
NA,region. The Minister points out that the,72
NA,convention needs only 30 ratifications for it,72
NA,to come into effect and says she is greatly,72
NA,encouraged that President Clinton has an-,72
NA,nounced the intention of the United States to,72
NA,sign the convention. I endorse the Minister's,72
NA,comment-the coalition is also extremely,72
NA,pleased to see President Clinton's interest in,72
NA,this convention and his agreement to sign it.,72
NA,"However, I ask the Minister: why has",72
NA,Australia delayed so long in signing the,72
NA,convention? We have ratified the climate,72
NA,change convention but have yet to ratify the,72
NA,biodiversity convention. Why has it taken so,72
NA,"long? What is the hold-up? The Minister, in",72
NA,"her speech, said that she was going to New",72
NA,York in June when there is a possibility that,72
NA,"she will ratify the convention. If not, we",72
NA,would suggest to the Minister that this would,72
NA,be a good time for her to. present the paper-,72
NA,work required for ratification of the conven-,72
NA,tion.,72
NA,The coalition welcomes the Government's,72
NA,to maintaining biodiversity but,72
NA,we would like more details. The goals of the,72
NA,maintenance of biodiversity are fully support-,72
NA,ed. We would like to see more of the specif-,72
NA,"ics. In particular, the coalition believes that",72
NA,not enough has been done on feral animal,72
NA,control. The extension of national parks and,72
NA,world heritage areas are all very well but of,72
NA,little use if these parks and world heritage,72
NA,"areas are ravaged by feral foxes, rabbits,",72
NA,"goats, pigs, cats and brumbies. We would also",72
NA,welcome a statement from the Minister on,72
NA,sustainable agriculture.,72
NA,The coalition hopes that opportunities are,72
NA,provided to business and industry groups to,72
NA,participate extensively in the finalisation of,72
NA,the biodiversity strategy. Affected parties such,72
NA,"as pastoralists, mining and exploration bodies,",72
NA,"as well as conservation groups, must be given",72
NA,the opportunity to contribute effectively to,73
NA,such strategy. I shall return to community,73
NA,consultation later in agenda 21.,73
NA,I turn now to the Minister's statements on,73
NA,agenda 21. The Minister is confident that the,73
NA,Government can meet the obligations that,73
NA,agenda 21 places on Australia through the,73
NA,arrangements established under the 1992,73
NA,intergovernmental agreement on the environ-,73
NA,ment. By abolishing the cabinet committee on,73
NA,"sustainable development, the Prime Minister",73
NA,( Mr Keating) has cast some doubt on the,73
NA,genuineness of his commitment to the ESD,73
NA,process. The Minister indicated that she,73
NA,believed Australia's only ESD strategy is,73
NA,already see- as something of a model in,73
NA,implementing the recommendations of agenda,73
NA,21.,73
NA,I believe what has been praised is not so,73
NA,much the strategy itself but the consultative,73
NA,process that went into it. We would hope that,73
NA,"this consultation process continues, although",73
NA,we note with concern that earlier in the,73
NA,Minister's speech she referred to receiving,73
NA,comments from parties outside the Govern-,73
NA,ment. I think the actual words were 'to,73
NA,receive'. We believe there is a need to do,73
NA,more than receive comments but to actively,73
NA,involve parties outside government in the,73
NA,development of strategies that deal with the,73
NA,environment.,73
NA,The Minister mentions using the IGAE and,73
NA,ESD policy as mechanisms to implement,73
NA,agenda 21. We would like further details from,73
NA,the Minister on how this will actually take,73
NA,place. We naturally are more interested in the,73
NA,"details than the broad assertions. For instance,",73
NA,we would like to hear more about the oppor-,73
NA,tunities Rio provides for environmentally,73
NA,"friendly industries, green jobs and utilisation",73
NA,of Australian expertise overseas. I would,73
NA,welcome a statement by the Minister on what,73
NA,"we are doing about these key issues, also the",73
NA,"major issue of the urban environment, and",73
NA,perhaps what progress the Minister has made,73
NA,in her department in looking at green account-,73
NA,ing and how we can put into the national,73
NA,accounts system the environmental values that,73
NA,are so important for the future of this country.,73
NA,The Minister's statement is welcome inas-,73
NA,much as it sets out the Government's response,73
NA,to the Earth Summit. We give notice that we,73
NA,will be closely monitoring the Government's,73
NA,activities to ensure that the rhetoric is,73
NA,matched by action.,73

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER, Mr Speaker has,73

NA,The deplorable financial mismanagement of the,73

NA,places-,73
Mr COSTELLO ,Higgins) (3.58 p.m.)-,73
NA,The Government's economic policy is in a,73
NA,shambles. Whether you look at the current,73
NA,"account, the foreign debt, the Budget deficit",73
NA,"or the Government's financial obligations, it",73
NA,is clear that this is a government driven by,73
NA,debt. It is a debt driven government. The,73
NA,tragedy of Australia is that the legacy of 10,73
NA,years of Keating mismanagement is that,73
NA,Australia is haunted by debt. There is a,73
NA,"spectre that is haunting the Australian people,",73
NA,and it is the debt that has been run up under,73
NA,10 years of mismanagement by the Keating,73
NA,Government.,73
NA,The latest blow came yesterday when report,73
NA,No. 34 of the Auditor-General entitled The,73
NA,national Bankcard: who will pay the piper?,73
NA,was tabled in the Senate. It has been tabled,73
NA,today in the House. The Auditor-General has,73
NA,"savaged this Government, its reporting mecha-",73
NA,"nism, its accountability and the way in which",73
NA,the Government reports to the Parliament and,73
NA,to the taxpayers. The Auditor-General has,73
NA,found that the Government has entered obli-,73
NA,gations of around $125 billion and has set,73
NA,aside only about $57 billion of liquid assets,73
NA,to meet them. The report says that the figure,74
NA,is known to be understated. The question is,74
NA,by how much. How much has this Govern-,74
NA,ment run up on the Bankcard? How much,74
NA,will future generations of Australians have to,74
NA,pay for the Government's mismanagement?,74
NA,"Who will pay the piper, as the Auditor-Gener-",74
NA,al says?,74
NA,We find that the Government has no plan,74
NA,"to stabilise debt, let alone pay it back, and no",74
NA,plan which can service the debts that have,74
NA,been run up in the last 10 years of Keating,74
NA,mismanagement. This Government has a,74
NA,"policy in relation to debt which says, 'Let the",74
NA,children pay; run the debts up today and put,74
NA,the debts onto the children tomorrow'. It is a,74
NA,let the children pay policy of running up debt,74
NA,on Bankcard and asking future generations of,74
NA,Australians to bail out this profligate Govern-,74
NA,ment.,74
NA,We saw an absolutely shameful perform-,74
NA,ance in Question Time today when the Treas-,74
NA,urer ( Mr Dawkins) came in here and launched,74
NA,a savage attack on the Auditor-General. It was,74
NA,a disgraceful attack. Let me make it clear: the,74
NA,Auditor-General of the Commonwealth is,74
NA,appointed by the Government; he is given,74
NA,statutory protection; but the Auditor-General,74
NA,reports to the Parliament. The Auditor-Gener-,74
NA,al is one of those independent statutory,74
NA,officers reporting to the Parliament. The,74
NA,office of the Auditor-General was designed to,74
NA,"be free of government influence, to provide",74
NA,"a check on government waste, and to provide",74
NA,a check on government mismanagement.,74
NA,"In relation to the Auditor-General, this",74
NA,Government has made exactly the same,74
NA,response that it makes to the Parliament. It,74
NA,resents checks - on its authority; it resents,74
NA,independent statutory officers; it resents those,74
NA,independent mechanisms that force it to be,74
NA,accountable. This Government treats the,74
NA,Parliament with contempt; and today we saw,74
NA,evidence that this Government treats the,74
NA,Auditor-General with contempt. I say to this,74
NA,"Government that the Opposition, which",74
NA,"believes the Parliament is here for a purpose,",74
NA,believes that the Auditor-General is here for,74
NA,a purpose. The Auditor-General is here to,74
NA,keep the Government honest and we will not,74
NA,brook any attack on his independence. The,74
NA,Auditor-General is here to keep a check on,74
NA,runaway government.,74
NA,What does the Treasurer say about it? The,74
NA,Treasurer comes into this place and accuses,74
NA,the Auditor-General of making unwarranted,74
NA,"remarks, of being neither professional nor",74
NA,responsible. I want to tell the people of,74
NA,Australia who it is that is being unprofession-,74
NA,"al. It is the Treasurer, who comes into a place",74
NA,where he enjoys parliamentary privilege and,74
NA,who starts attacking public servants because,74
NA,they tell the truth.,74
NA,It is reminiscent of the dying days of the,74
NA,Kirner Government in Victoria-another,74
NA,"government in financial difficulty, and another",74
NA,"government which, in its dying days,",74
NA,launched attacks on the Auditor-General. We,74
NA,will see more of these attacks-attacks on the,74
NA,"Parliament, attacks on the Opposition, attacks",74
NA,"on the Auditor-General, attacks on the",74
NA,messengers-because the Government does,74
NA,not like the truth.,74
NA,Let us be clear about why this attack was,74
NA,made in the Parliament today. This attack was,74
NA,made in the Parliament today because this,74
NA,Government is trying to intimidate the Audi-,74
NA,tor-General out of telling the truth. That is,74
NA,why the attack was made. The Government,74
NA,does not want the Auditor-General to disclose,74
NA,"to the people of Australia, to the taxpayers of",74
NA,"Australia, why the Government has got into",74
NA,this particular financial situation. It is nothing,74
NA,more than straight intimidation.,74
NA,The people of Australia need the Auditor-,74
NA,General. They need the Auditor-General to be,74
NA,fearless because they need somebody who is,74
NA,prepared to tell the truth about the debt and,74
NA,economic mismanagement of this Govern-,74
NA,ment. The Opposition will not stand by and,74
NA,let the Government attack the Auditor-Gener-,74
NA,al. We will not stand by and let it try to shoot,74
NA,the messengers. We will not stand by and let,74
NA,it cover up all the profligacy and all of the,74
NA,debt because we will stand up and speak the,74
NA,"truth and tell the people of Australia, 'This",74
NA,Government has let you down'.,74
NA,This Government is building up debt on a,74
NA,bankcard which will have to be paid back by,74
NA,future generations. It is a form of robbing the,74
NA,future. The Government has not only robbed,74
NA,"the current generation, but also is now rob-",74
NA,bing the future. It is building up unfunded,75
NA,liabilities-liabilities of today-but not,75
NA,aside money to pay for them. There is only,75
NA,one way that they can be honoured; there is,75
NA,only one way that those unfunded liabilities,75
NA,can be brought to fruition in the futurethat,75
NA,"is, by taxing the future generations of Australgovernment",75
NA,ia. Future generations of Australians are being,75
NA,robbed today by the profligacy of this Gov-,75
NA,ernment.,75
NA,The Government's reaction is not only in,75
NA,relation to the most recent Auditor-General's,75
NA,"report. There is a foreign debt problem which,",75
NA,"under the Keating treasurership, started off at",75
NA,$23 billion and after 10 years has gone to,75
NA,"$168 billion, soaking up about three times our",75
NA,export earnings. There was the current ac-,75
NA,count figure in March of $2.1 billion. If the,75
NA,IMF is beginning to knock on doors in Cana-,75
NA,"da, we hear an eerie silence in Australia.",75
NA,Watch out for those knocks because this,75
NA,Government has taken debt out of hitherto,75
NA,acceptable levels.,75
NA,Then there is the Budget deficit. When the,75
NA,Minister for Finance ( Mr Willis) came to that,75
NA,portfolio he inherited a surplus of $8 billion.,75
NA,Over the three years of the last Parliament he,75
NA,"turned that around to a $16 billion deficit,",75
NA,largest in Australian history. Even if he brings,75
NA,"in all the projections, between 1991 and 1997",75
NA,he will run up a deficit of about $80 billion.,75
NA,"In the last financial year, this Government",75
NA,"was overspending on revenue-that is, spend:-",75
NA,ing more than it raised-by about $45 million,75
NA,a day. Over that six-year period the Govern-,75
NA,ment will rack up a deficit of about $80,75
NA,"billion, comparable only to the Whitlam",75
NA,"period. They will be saying, 'Willis is greater",75
NA,than Whitlam' in the financial history of the,75
NA,years to come.,75
NA,There are no redeeming features whatso-,75
NA,ever. At least Whitlam went broke keeping,75
NA,"his promise, but this Government is going to",75
NA,go broke breaking its promises. We have seen,75
NA,the already littered history of broken promis-,75
NA,es. Remember the promise about the free,75
NA,dental scheme? Remember the promise about,75
NA,"the home-care child allowance, now on the",75
NA,never-never? Remember the matching funds,75
NA,for the charities? Remember what the Labor,75
NA,"Party said in the election, that it was going to",75
NA,setting take pensioners out of the tax system?,75
NA,The breaking of that promise is going to,75
NA,leave a bitter winter of betrayal for Australian,75
NA,pensioners. It is going to be a bitter winter of,75
NA,betrayal for all those people who look to,75
NA,to keep its promises. We know,75
NA,what the Government is up to. The Govern-,75
NA,ment is trying to soften up the Australian,75
NA,public for new taxes. It cannot honour its,75
NA,"promises, it cannot get its deficits under",75
NA,"control, and it is trying to soften up Austral-",75
NA,ians for new taxes. It asks whether it should,75
NA,"bring in an energy tax, an extended goods tax,",75
NA,"a wealth tax that the ACTU wants, or death",75
NA,"duties, which the Labor Party loves.",75
NA,We say the answer is none of the above,75
NA,because when the Australian public voted in,75
NA,that election they did not vote for any new,75
NA,taxes. They did not want the Government to,75
NA,increase taxes to pay for tax cuts. The Aus-,75
NA,tralian people voted against taxes in the,75
NA,election. So the Government should read,75
NA,those votes: no new taxes. It should read them,75
NA,"well, because the Australian public are not",75
NA,going to be benign on this Government when,75
NA,it goes into higher taxes. Let us make it,75
NA,absolutely clear that there is only one reason,75
NA,the for higher taxes: if the Government will not,75
NA,"cut its own spending, it will have to cut the",75
NA,taxpayers' spending. It is going to cut the,75
NA,taxpayers' spending by taking taxes out of,75
NA,taxpayers' pockets so that they cannot spend.,75
NA,This Government will not control its own,75
NA,"spending, and so it intends to cut the spending",75
NA,of the Australian taxpayers.,75
NA,Let me come to the Auditor-General's,75
NA,report-the Auditor-General who gave this,75
NA,report the title The national Bankcard: who,75
NA,will pay the piper? This was a first attempt to,75
NA,report on the financial obligations of the,75
NA,"Government, and it was scathing. In fact, the",75
NA,Auditor-General said he did not even have,75
NA,enough information to state clearly and,75
NA,precisely how large the obligations were. The,75
NA,Auditor-General said:,75
NA,The ANAO considers that the information,75
NA,currently provided is deficient to such an extent,75
NA,that the Parliament and the taxpayer is not in a,75
NA,position to assess the Government's management.,75
NA,He went on to say:,75
NA,And what of concerns that future generations,76
NA,Australians will be made to pay for the excesses,76
NA,todays generation? Again the Parliament and the,76
NA,Australian taxpayers are not provided with informa-,76
NA,tion necessary to determine the extent of,76
NA,intergenerational transfers resulting from current,76
NA,policy decisions.,76
NA,Then the Auditor-General went on to talk,76
NA,about accountability and the infonnation that,76
NA,has to be given to this Parliament to get that,76
NA,kind of accountability. He went on to say that,76
NA,the infonnation-which the Government does,76
NA,not have-would be essential for good man-,76
NA,agement of a company. If the Government,76
NA,were running a company it would have to do,76
NA,better than this. This Government has a Bill,76
NA,before the Parliament to ensure that com-,76
NA,panies engage in continuous financial disclos-,76
NA,"ure. But, even on an annual budgetary basis,",76
NA,the Government cannot disclose liabilities in,76
NA,superannuation. What hypocrites I How can,76
NA,the Government possibly lecture Australian,76
NA,business on the need for continuous financial,76
NA,disclosure when it is not even disclosing on,76
NA,an annual basis the infonnation that its audi-,76
NA,tor requires to make an assessment.,76
NA,Let me give a hypothetical example. When,76
NA,the Westpac Bank was getting into trouble,76
NA,and Sir Eric Neal was reporting as the chair-,76
NA,"man, how would the Australian financial",76
NA,community have reacted if he had stood up,76
NA,"and said, 'Well, our auditor is unprofessional.",76
NA,It is all the fault of our auditor. '? If a com-,76
NA,pany director behaved like that he would,76
NA,probably find himself in a court of law. Yet,76
NA,that is exactly what this Government is doing.,76
NA,"It is standing up and saying, 'We can't give",76
NA,you the infonnation that would even be,76
NA,required in the management of a good com-,76
NA,"pany, but let's tell you all about our auditor.",76
NA,He's unprofessional. Don't take any notice of,76
NA,him. He's belled the cat. He's disclosed the,76
NA,financial situation. We don't like people like,76
NA,that. We stand up in parliament and we attack,76
NA,people like that. We don't want the Parlia-,76
NA,ment and the taxpayer to know that kind of,76
NA,infonnation'.,76
NA,Let us also make this clear: the Auditor-,76
NA,General did not say that Australia was insol-,76
NA,vent; he said it would be insolvent if it were,76
NA,not for the power to tax. We know that the,76
NA,Government can solve its solvency problems,76
NA,of by expropriating the property of taxpayers.,76
NA,of We know that. The Government has this,76
NA,unique ability when it gets into financial,76
NA,situations to take money from others to rectify,76
NA,the problem.,76
NA,"The bottom line of that is, as we see in the",76
NA,"Budget deficit, that all roads lead to tax. But",76
NA,the worst feature of those roads that are,76
NA,leading to tax is that they are not just the,76
NA,"taxes of today's citizens, they are not just",76
NA,"today's taxes, because, as the Auditor-General",76
NA,"makes entirely clear, this Government is",76
NA,engaged in an intergenerational transfer. It has,76
NA,not set aside the money today for the liabili-,76
NA,ties of today. It will have to get those taxes,76
NA,from future generations of Australians. Future,76
NA,generations of Australians under the 'Let the,76
NA,children pay policy' will be given a legacy of,76
NA,debt and obligation. As if it were not bad,76
NA,enough to run debts on this generation of,76
NA,"voters, this Government has decided to finan-",76
NA,cially abuse the next one as well.,76
NA,"We say to the Government, 'Come clean",76
NA,with the Australian people. Provide that,76
NA,information. Come clean on your obligations.,76
NA,Thoroughly audit your liabilities. Announce,76
NA,a debt strategy. Attend to the burgeoning,76
NA,"outlays. And, above all, keep your hands off",76
NA,future generations of Australians because they,76
NA,know that the current ones have suffered,76
NA,badly enough'.,76
Mr WILLIS ,Gellibrand-Minister for,76
NA,Finance) (4.12 p.m.)-We just heard a quarter,76
NA,of an hour of diatribe. I did not hear a sen-,76
NA,sible remark in the whole quarter of an hour.,76
NA,Let us get this in some sort of perspective.,76
NA,The honourable member for Higgins ( Mr,76
NA,Costello) talks about the Government's,76
NA,financially abusing the children because there,76
NA,is some government debt-running up debt in,76
NA,our period of office and putting it on the,76
NA,"Bankcard. As the report makes clear, the level",76
NA,of government debt at 30 June 1992 was 11.8,76
NA,"per cent of GOP, which compares favourably",76
NA,with the average of the last 10 years of 13.2,76
NA,per cent-it has come down.,76
NA,"We had four years of budget surpluses, the",76
NA,only surpluses that have ever been produced,76
NA,by a government in the history of this country,76
NA,since we have had the modem budgeting,76
NA,"system. Through the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and",76
NA,1980s when the Opposition was in govern-,77
NA,ment it could never produce one budget,77
NA,"surplus. We produced four budget surpluses,",77
NA,with a collective $18 billion of surplus in,77
NA,time. The honourable member for Higgins,77
NA,should not stand here lecturing us about,77
NA,financial propriety. We are the ones who,77
NA,produced the budget surpluses. We are the,77
NA,ones who actually reduced the debt compared,77
NA,with the average of the last 10 years. Let us,77
NA,get that in some perspective.,77
NA,Let us also look at the way that other,77
NA,governments have their debt structures and,77
NA,how we sit in relation to them. The OECD,77
NA,Economic Outlook for December .1992 pub-,77
NA,lished gen-ral government net debt for 18,77
NA,OECD countries. It lists them in groups of,77
NA,"high debt countries, medium debt countries",77
NA,and low debt countries. The high debt count-,77
NA,"ries are Belgium, Italy, Ireland and Greece,",77
NA,with a range of government debt to GOP of,77
NA,124 per cent to 82 per cent. The medium debt,77
NA,"countries are Netherlands, Canada, Austria,",77
NA,"United States, Spain and the United Kingdom,",77
NA,with a range of government debt to GOP of,77
NA,60 per cent to 36 per cent. The low debt,77
NA,"countries are Denmark at 29 per cent, France",77
NA,"at 29 per cent, Germany at 23 per cent and",77
NA,Australia at 15.8 per cent. There are four,77
NA,"countries below us: Finland, Japan, Sweden",77
NA,and Norway. The average government debt as,77
NA,a proportion of GOP of all the countries is,77
NA,43.6 per cent. Australia's debt is 15.8-about,77
NA,a third of the average of all the OECD count-,77
NA,ries.,77
NA,Those opposite should not give us this,77
NA,absolute garbage about our being financially,77
NA,irresponsible. This Government has a relative-,77
NA,ly low level of debt compared with that of,77
NA,most other OECD Western developed count-,77
NA,"ries and, financially, it has behaved very",77
NA,responsibly in its period in office. Of course,77
NA,there has been an increase in the deficit in,77
NA,reCent times and that has meant an increase in,77
NA,debt. But that has been the experience of,77
NA,every Westerri country in the last few years.,77
NA,There has been an international economic,77
NA,recession which has meant that all govern-,77
NA,ments have suffered losses of tax revenue and,77
NA,"increases in government expenditure, particu-",77
NA,"larly on unemployment benefits. Therefore,",77
NA,most countries have run up bigger budget,77
NA,deficits and a couple have reduced surpluses.,77
NA,The budgetary situations in all of those,77
NA,that countries have deteriorated in recent times.,77
NA,There is nothing unique about Australia's,77
NA,experience in that regard. It is what happens,77
NA,when the economic cycle turns down.,77
NA,We have added to that a little by our efforts,77
NA,"to stimulate the economy, and various other",77
NA,countries have done exactly the same thing.,77
NA,Even the United Kingdom Conservative,77
NA,Government had a massive change in its,77
NA,budget outcome from a budget surplus to a,77
NA,deficit of about six per cent of GOP. That is,77
NA,well above ours as a proportion of GOP. That,77
NA,Government has done that largely because of,77
NA,the automatic blow-out of the budget due to,77
NA,recession and also due to the action it has,77
NA,taken to try to stimulate the economy. This is,77
NA,happening in just about all of the Western,77
NA,countries. So this absurd notion that Australia,77
NA,is somehow uniquely suffering some increase,77
NA,in its deficit and that the Government is,77
NA,therefore culpable in the extreme and is,77
NA,laying a terrible burden on future generations,77
NA,is just total garbage.,77
NA,"Obviously, it is not a matter of no concern",77
NA,that there has been an increase in the deficit.,77
NA,We recognise the importance of getting the,77
NA,deficit down. We have made the declaration,77
NA,that we will reduce it to one per cent of GDP,77
NA,over the medium term-by 1996-97. That,77
NA,point has been made amply in recent times;,77
NA,I do not need to go into it any further.,77
NA,I return to the Auditor-General's report.,77
NA,"Essentially, it says that the Government needs",77
NA,to make some changes to government ac-,77
NA,counting procedures so as to provide a full,77
NA,view of the Government's true financial,77
NA,position. We accept that it is desirable to do,77
NA,that. In fact; we have already adopted the,77
NA,major reforms needed to bring that about-,77
NA,"that is, a move to a system of accrual ac-",77
NA,counting. It is already happening. It happens,77
NA,in most of the GBBs and government authori-,77
NA,ties. I said last year that we were going to,77
NA,introduce it as from 1994-95 in reports of all,77
NA,government departments. Once we move to an,77
NA,accrual system all the departments will give,77
NA,a full assessment of assets and liabilities-I,77
NA,stress the assets as well as the liabilities;,77
NA,assets are remarkably lacking in this analy-,78
NA,"sis-and then we will have full accounting,",78
NA,"department by department, of their overall",78
NA,balances.,78
NA,"Putting all that together, along with the",78
NA,GBBs and authorities-most of which have,78
NA,already moved to accrual accounting-we can,78
NA,get whole of government reporting. Research,78
NA,is already going on to see what is involved in,78
NA,bringing all of that together to get whole of,78
NA,government accounting happening in a proper,78
NA,way. If that research comes up with the right,78
NA,"result, we may well be able to move, as the",78
NA,"Auditor-General would like, to a whole of",78
NA,government reporting process by 1995. That,78
NA,will be fine; we have no problems with that,78
NA,"whatever. In fact, virtually all the information",78
NA,that the Auditor-General says is lacking at the,78
NA,present time will come to light through the,78
NA,move to accrual accounting. We have no,78
NA,problem with that point. That is not to say,78
NA,that all of the recommendations are accept-,78
NA,"able; they are not, and I will come to a couple",78
NA,of those.,78
NA,While it has been in office the Government,78
NA,has made various improvements to its finan-,78
NA,cial management so as to provide more,78
NA,information to the public. Before we came to,78
NA,office there were no forward estimates of,78
NA,"outlays showing what expenditures would be,",78
NA,"department by department, for the Budget",78
NA,year plus three more years; that did not exist.,78
NA,We publish those outlays in the Budget,78
NA,papers each year so that the people of Aus-,78
NA,tralia are aware of where all of those outlays,78
NA,for program expenditures are going.,78
NA,The Government has that knowledge. The,78
NA,"Government, I might say, has knowledge",78
NA,"beyond that. As appropriate, we look at",78
NA,expenditures in a longer time frame. Where,78
NA,we think that there may be something going,78
NA,to happen if we pursue a certain course which,78
NA,might have consequences in the out years that,78
NA,"would be of concern, then we might do some",78
NA,analysis of that for our own internal purposes.,78
NA,It is not a matter of the Government not,78
NA,knowing beypnd the four-year period. We do,78
NA,know where it matters but it is just not rel-,78
NA,evant or necessary to do it for every program.,78
NA,The assessment of superannuation liability,78
NA,is also something that has been produced,78
NA,consistently since we have been in office. It,78
NA,"was first produced in 1982, before we came",78
NA,"into office, but we have updated it regularly",78
NA,since. So the amount of unfunded superannua-,78
NA,tion liability is something which comes to,78
NA,light every few years. We have a three-year,78
NA,"cycle, which has become a five-year cycle at",78
NA,the moment because of the· big changes that,78
NA,were made to government superannuation in,78
NA,1990. The introduction of the public sector,78
NA,superannuation scheme and the changes to,78
NA,invalidity requirements meant that there was,78
NA,a considerable cut in the costs of public sector,78
NA,superannuation and until that new scheme,78
NA,settles down it is appropriate to delay the,78
NA,recalculation of the unfunded liability. But,78
NA,that will take place next year and then be on,78
NA,a three-year cycle. So we will continually,78
NA,have the actuary doing that update and pro-,78
NA,viding that information. It is not a matter of,78
NA,hiding information. We have produced it,78
NA,several times since we have been in office,78
NA,and we will continue to do so.,78
NA,As a consequence of the changes that we,78
NA,have already made the Government publishes,78
NA,most of the information contained in the,78
NA,Auditor-General's report. Where do honour-,78
NA,able members think he got these figures from?,78
NA,He got them from government reports of one,78
NA,sort or another. In a couple of cases he had to,78
NA,make some estimates-and he did that with,78
NA,"the assistance of my department, I might",78
NA,say-but mostly it was publicly available,78
NA,information. What he has done here is to,78
NA,draw it all together. In the case of the unfund-,78
NA,ed liability he updated it with advice from my,78
NA,department.,78
NA,So we do not see that where there are,78
NA,deficiencies in the availability of information,78
NA,there is a problem; because most of that will,78
NA,become available anyway with the decisions,78
NA,"already taken. Departments have been told,",78
NA,"for instance, that next year they must account",78
NA,for employee entitlements. After that they will,78
NA,be on full accrual accounting and so the,78
NA,information will all be available.,78
NA,This report does have a number of deficien-,78
NA,cies. While seeking to assess total financial,78
NA,"obligations, it does not take full account of",78
NA,the Government's assets or indeed some,78
NA,revenues that are legally to flow to the Gov-,78
NA,ernment. The report refers only to available,79
NA,"liquid assets of $57 billion. It says, 'Here",79
NA,all these obligations' -some of them involve,79
NA,expenditures going out 30 or 40 years- 'but,79
NA,you have got only $57 billion in the bank,79
NA,pay for it'. These are expenditures which,79
NA,be 40 years away. It is stupid to compare cash,79
NA,assets with liabilities going out in 30 or,79
NA,"years time. Of course, what we need is full",79
NA,accounting. That will involve government,79
NA,assets being brought into the picture-and,79
NA,that will be possible with accrual account-,79
NA,"ing-and also bringing in revenue, which is",79
NA,not done in this report. That is revenue,79
NA,is legally obliged to be paid to the Governknow,79
NA,ment.,79
NA,"I have mentioned international comparisons,",79
NA,which are patently lacking in the Auditorprogram,79
NA,General's report. The report also implies that,79
NA,Budget deficits that go beyond the expendiyears.,79
NA,ture on infrastructure are inappropriate be-,79
NA,cause they impose a burden on future genera-,79
NA,tions. It seems to say that the whole General,79
NA,countercyclical approach of fiscal policy,79
NA,"wrong. That seems to be a terribly narrow obligation,",79
NA,accounting based approach to the role of,79
NA,government in terms of budgetary policy.,79
NA,Budgetary policy is not just about each year,79
NA,"producing a balanced book, but also about",79
NA,making sure that the economy runs as well as,79
NA,it possibly can. That means that at times there,79
NA,"will be Budget deficits and at times, hopefulback",79
NA,"ly, Budget surpluses according to the economsuperannuation",79
NA,ic cycle. It does not mean a rigid adherence,79
NA,to Budget outcomes which are balanced or,79
NA,near to.,79
NA,The report claims that funding decisions,79
NA,taken by the Government lack the benefit,79
NA,the information that would normally be,79
NA,available in any well-run company which,79
NA,manages the level and impact of its obliga-,79
NA,"tions on future cash flows, costs and invest-",79
NA,ment decisions. I think that is not a true,79
NA,statement. It is patently untrue in my view.,79
NA,The Government takes decisions in the full,79
NA,knowledge of the likely costs of funding,79
NA,various programs over a four-year period.,79
Mr CADMAN ,You've never got a Budget,79
NA,right yet.,79
Mr WILLIS,Does the honourable membenefits,79
NA,ber want us to make the estimates over a,79
NA,"longer period, like five to 20 years, as the",79
NA,are Auditor-General suggests? Does he think there,79
NA,would not be even bigger errors involved,79
NA,there? Of course we can only make estimates.,79
NA,to We cannot make entirely accurate forecasts;,79
NA,can we can make the best estimates available.,79
NA,That is what we do in relation to those For-,79
NA,"40 ward Estimates. Obviously, they have errors",79
NA,"and the longer one goes out, the more likely",79
NA,there are to be errors in them.,79
NA,We also have a lot of other information that,79
NA,"is available to us, and I suspect much more",79
NA,which than is available to many businesses. We,79
NA,all about our debts; they are published,79
NA,in the Budget each year. We know all about,79
NA,our guarantees; they are published in the,79
NA,Budget each year. We know all about our,79
NA,outlays to the extent that we need to,79
NA,"know, and we do calculations beyond the out",79
NA,"In relation to superannuation, the Auditor-",79
NA,"suggests a number of things. Firstly,",79
NA,is he says that there is a $40 billion unfunded,79
NA,but there is no reference to the fact,79
NA,that the Government changed the scheme in,79
NA,1990 and in doing so reduced unfunded,79
NA,liabilities when it did so by $5 billion and,79
NA,new entrants costs by one-third. There was no,79
NA,mention of that and that is a deficiency in the,79
NA,report. There is no recognition of the .claw-,79
NA,saving resulting from tax payable on,79
NA,"paid, and there are reduced",79
NA,pension payouts because people are on super-,79
NA,"annuation and not on pensions. In fact, on our",79
NA,best estimate that clawback cuts the cost by,79
NA,$19 billion of that $40 billion. Almost half,79
NA,of the costs are saved by the clawback which,79
NA,gets no mention whatever in this report.,79
NA,It is also the case that the Government is,79
NA,not a private or a public company and there-,79
NA,fore it will not go broke. The security prob-,79
NA,lem relating to the need for funded superan-,79
NA,nuation in companies so that people can be,79
NA,sure that they have their retirement· benefits,79
NA,when they retire is not an issue for a govern-,79
NA,ment which will be in place for the long term.,79
NA,People can have unfUJided liability knowing,79
NA,that they will - able to get their retirement,79
NA,when they are due. This report has a,79
NA,"lot of shortcomings, but the basic recommen-",79
NA,dations are generally acceptable. (TIme ex-,80
NA,pired),80
Mr NEHL ,Cowper) (4.27 p.m.)-I have,80
NA,listened with absolute amazement-and I will,80
NA,give the words of the Minister for Finance,80
NA,( Mr Willis) straight back to him-to this,80
NA,garbage. He started off fulminating against the,80
NA,"Auditor-General and us by saying, 'Do not",80
NA,give us this garbage'. He wants to provide,80
NA,"some perspective about government debt, but",80
NA,I have a message for the Minister: we are not,80
NA,talking about debt. The Auditor-General's,80
NA,"report is not about debt or deficit, yet for the",80
NA,last 15 minutes the Minister has carried on,80
NA,talking about debt and deficit. We are not,80
NA,here about that. We are here about obliga-,80
NA,"tions, arrangements and commitments. That is",80
NA,what the Auditor-General's report is about. It,80
NA,is not about government debt as a proportion,80
NA,of GOP.,80
NA,The Minister suggested fairly early on that,80
NA,the whole thing was an absurd notion. The,80
NA,way the Minister has approached this matter,80
NA,"is ,absurd. The reality is that today during",80
NA,Question Time the Treasurer ( Mr Dawkins),80
NA,delivered a most disgraceful attack on the,80
NA,Auditor-General of this country. Having been,80
NA,associated with and a member of the Joint,80
NA,Committee of Public Accounts for the last,80
NA,"three parliaments, I know what a good job the",80
NA,Auditor-General does and how much the,80
NA,people of Australia and the Parliament of,80
NA,Australia depend on the Auditor-General.,80
NA,Every member of this House should react,80
NA,adversely to the attack of the Treasurer on the,80
NA,Auditor-General today. It was totally inappro-,80
NA,priate.,80
NA,"The Minister for Finance, in winding up his",80
NA,"contribution, said that there were no interna-",80
NA,tional comparisons in the report. Why does he,80
NA,want international comparisons? Does he want,80
NA,to be able to say that we are not as badly off,80
NA,as Somalia or somewhere else? What does he,80
NA,want them for? What value are they? We are,80
NA,concerned about the level of obligation and,80
NA,commitment of this Government to the people,80
NA,"of Australia. Quite frankly, the Government's",80
NA,"obligations are about $16,000 for every",80
NA,taxpayer. The Australian National Audit,80
NA,Office has identified-I repeat the figures-,80
NA,that outstanding Federal Government obliga-,80
NA,"tions are in excess of $125 billion, and we",80
NA,know that this figure is understated. Nobody,80
NA,knows what the real figure is.,80
NA,We are getting accrual accounting in a year,80
NA,or two. Some government departments are,80
NA,"bringing in accrual accounting, and it is about",80
NA,time. I applaud the Minister for doing that; it,80
NA,is the right way to go. We should have been,80
NA,doing it a long time ago. We can be critical,80
NA,of past g()vernments that they did not bring in,80
NA,accrual accounting.,80
NA,We are now dealing with a government that,80
NA,has been in power for 10 years. We are,80
NA,dealing with this Government that is guilty of,80
NA,financial mismanagement. The Minister,80
NA,"demonstrated that this afternoon when ,he",80
NA,talked about debt and deficit. The matter of,80
NA,public importance is not about debt and,80
NA,"deficit; it is about obligations, arrangements",80
NA,and commitments. It is quite obvious that any,80
NA,board of direCtors running a company the way,80
NA,the present and past Cabinet have run this,80
NA,country would not just be sacked; they would,80
NA,be gaoled.,80
NA,"This afternoon the Treasurer, in his dis-",80
NA,"graceful attack, said just how wrong and",80
NA,conceptually inaccurate that report is and' he,80
NA,referred to the people producing it as irre-,80
NA,sponSible. His throwaway line was 'if they,80
NA,were properly qualified'. I think that is a,80
NA,disgraceful attack on public servants who,80
NA,serve our society so well.,80
NA,"On the need to disclose, he said, 'Oh well,",80
NA,"we are moving in that direction', but he said",80
NA,that it was neither professional nor responsible,80
NA,of the auditor to raise the possibility that the,80
NA,Government could not meet its obligations.,80
NA,The Treasurer finished by saying that the,80
NA,Commonwealth has the power to tax. Yes;we,80
NA,know that the Commonwealth does have the,80
NA,power to tax. I want to put on the record that,80
NA,the Auditor-General in that report made that,80
NA,particular point. He said:,80
NA,The Commonwealth's· power to tax should en-,80
NA,sure-,80
NA,it 'should' ensure actually; that is interest-,80
NA,ing-,80
NA,that the Commonwealth remains solvent at all,80
NA,times.,80
NA,Let us hope so. But the auditor then went on,81
NA,to raise three possibilities for the Government,81
NA,to remain solvent. It can do it by increasing,81
NA,receipts by options such as increasing taxation,81
NA,levels or privatising government assets. Is it,81
NA,going to increase the taxation levels? Is it,81
NA,going to privatise again and again? The next,81
NA,one was:,81
NA,. the Federal Government being forced to reduce,81
NA,"expenditure in other areas of government, such as",81
NA,"infrastructure, thereby lowering the future standards",81
NA,"of living of Australians,",81
NA,"I do not debate that. I accept that, because",81
NA,"blind Freddy knows that it is true, right and",81
NA,correct. We know-and we knew before the,81
NA,last election-that this country is broke. All,81
NA,we have now is infonnation of future disaster.,81
Mr LLOYD ,And they lied to Australia.,81
Mr NEHL,They certainly lied to Austral-,81
NA,ia. There is no doubt about that. Obligation,81
NA,levels are increasing. This report does not,81
NA,attempt to examine the Commonwealth's,81
NA,"obligations over a period of time, but certain-",81
NA,ly the obligations will result in an escalation,81
NA,"of servicing costs, and that can have wider",81
NA,"economic implications, particularly with",81
NA,increased dependence on foreign debt by both,81
NA,private and public sectors.,81
NA,For the Auditor-General to make those,81
NA,"points, quite contrary to what the Treasurer",81
NA,"said, I believe was professional and respon-",81
NA,sible. It certainly sounds professional and,81
NA,responsible to me. But we have an increasing,81
NA,"dependence on foreign debt, and we all know",81
NA,of our foreign debt. It is now $168 billion net.,81
NA,"It is interesting that, although the figures are",81
NA,different-they are very much higher-they,81
NA,put us in mind of Whitlam. There is a little,81
NA,sniff of Whitlam in the air with all of this. In,81
NA,"fact, I can say to honourable members in this",81
NA,chamber that the Government might be,81
NA,"asking, 'Khemlani, where are you? We need",81
NA,you'. That is what the Government needs. The,81
NA,Prime Minister (Me Keating) needs Khemlani,81
NA,because our country is going to go even,81
NA,further down the drain.,81
NA,This matter of public importance on the,81
NA,Auditor-General's report is all about financial,81
NA,mismanagement. Again the Minister at the,81
NA,table does not speak to the issue or about the,81
NA,contents of the report. He concentrates on,81
NA,debt and deficits when we are talking about,81
NA,obligations.,81
NA,Mr Braithwaite-And sell more bananas.,81
Mr NEHL,I always respond to an inter-,81
NA,jection about selling marvellous bananas from,81
NA,"my electorate, but we are concerned that",81
NA,future generations will be made to pay for the,81
NA,eX(fesses of today's generation. I believe that,81
NA,to be true. The cost of servicing central,81
NA,government borro-ings is estimated to in-,81
NA,crease by 60 per cent over the next four,81
NA,years. That estimate is at the current interest,81
NA,rates. Can honourable members imagine what,81
NA,"that will do when we get, as we probably",81
NA,"will, an increase in interest rates?",81
NA,Superannuation outlays have virtually,81
NA,doubled over the past 10 years. What about,81
NA,the next 10 years? I am particularly interested,81
NA,in this because unfunded superannuation and,81
NA,government obligations are rising as a per-,81
NA,"centage of GDP. Of course, we have not even",81
NA,mentioned the Government's liabilities for,81
NA,"long service leave, annual leave or 171h per",81
NA,cent annual leave loading.,81
NA,I ask whether superannuation is a govern-,81
NA,ment priority. I am particularly interested in,81
NA,this point because I recently had a visit from,81
NA,an Australian Taxation Office official who,81
NA,asked me to help him advise small businesses,81
NA,in my electorate which are going broke to pay,81
NA,their superannuation levy. If they do not pay,81
NA,it by 30 June they will lose tax deductibility,81
NA,in this financial year. Then they have until 14,81
NA,"August, and if they are one day late they not",81
NA,only lose tax deductibility altogether but also,81
NA,have interest imposed on them straight away.,81
NA,"As well as that, I think there is a fee of $50",81
NA,per employer and $30 per employee. I believe,81
NA,it is fair enough that the Taxation Office,81
NA,should help people to realise that D-day is,81
NA,"coming: deduction day, doomsday-",81
NA,Mr Truss-Disaster day.,81
Mr NEHL,Disaster day indeed. I am busy,81
NA,in my electorate helping to infonn employers,81
NA,and employees about the need to meet their,81
NA,obligations in relation to superannuation.,81
NA,What is the Minister doing? Where is the,81
NA,"Government's obligation, where is its commit-",81
NA,ment and where are its accruals to meet the,81
NA,superannuation that will have to be paid out,82
NA,before too long?,82
NA,I conclude by saying that it is unlikely that,82
NA,even the smallest Australian business would,82
NA,base decisions on the limited information-,82
NA,the limited knowledge and the limited facts-,82
NA,upon which this Government is running this,82
NA,country. I commend what the Auditor-General,82
NA,and his officers have done; they have high-,82
NA,lighted something that needed to be highlight-,82
NA,ed. We need more open government and more,82
NA,"information, and I think' it is about time that",82
NA,this present Government faced up to its,82
NA,responsibilities. It should no longer continue,82
NA,"to distort the issue, as the Minister did today",82
NA,in talking about debt and the deficit when we,82
NA,are talking about obligations and commit-,82
NA,ments.,82
Mr ELLIOTT ,parramatta) (4.37 p.m.)-In,82
NA,speaking to the matter of public importance,82
NA,"today, I think it is important at the outset to",82
NA,give some recognition to the positive steps,82
NA,that have been taken. I do not believe the,82
NA,Auditor-General's report No. 34 adequately,82
NA,reflects the reforms that have been undertaken,82
NA,by the Government in terms of disclosure of,82
NA,the accrual accounting arrangements and so,82
NA,on to which the Minister for Finance ( Mr,82
NA,"Willis) has referred, the general provisioning",82
NA,by the Government in relation to superannua-,82
NA,"tion, and the changes that have been undertak-",82
NA,en constantly in that area. We can go a step,82
NA,further and say that the Auditor-General's,82
NA,report is framed in the most narrow account-,82
NA,ing terms. It does not take account of the,82
NA,broader economic issues one would have,82
NA,thought that a report which is trying to deal,82
NA,with these issues and which carries the emo-,82
NA,tive title that it does would have sought to,82
NA,reflect.,82
NA,In speaking to the matter of public import-,82
NA,"ance today, as in all these economic discus-",82
NA,"sions, opposition members continue to. decry",82
NA,the economic recovery and continue to pour,82
NA,scorn on what positive economic news there,82
NA,"may be. Indeed, the coverage of the Auditor-",82
NA,General's report in today's newspapers simi-,82
NA,larly misrepresents many of the constructive,82
NA,points and overstates some of the criticisms,82
NA,that are contained in the report. As far as I,82
NA,"can see, that is really the problem in this",82
NA,debate: not enough regard has been given to,82
NA,the positive steps which have been taken. It,82
NA,seems to me that the Auditor's report reflects,82
NA,an historical perspective more than a current,82
NA,perspective of the initiatives and reforms that,82
NA,the Government has undertaken.,82
NA,I turn first to the area of accrual accounting.,82
NA,The Auditor-General's report makes some,82
NA,"worthwhile recommendations in this area, but",82
NA,it fails to give credit to the Government's,82
NA,recent initiatives. It fails to recognise that the,82
NA,Minister for Finance has taken major steps in,82
NA,"this area. For example, some 35 government",82
NA,departments have volunteered to take part in,82
NA,a pilot program to produce financial state-,82
NA,ments on an accrual basis in 1992-93. The,82
NA,remaining departments will be doing the same,82
NA,in their 1993-94 statements.,82
NA,There are several reasons why the Govern-,82
NA,ment has moved to accrual accounting ar-,82
NA,rangements: to identify the cost of govern-,82
NA,ment programs; provide cost control and,82
NA,efficiency methods; improve asset manage-,82
NA,ment; assist in determining. pricing policies,82
NA,for user charging; monitor increased produc-,82
NA,tivity; enhance accountability; and so on. We,82
NA,did not have to wait for the Auditor-General,82
NA,to produce this report before addressing these,82
NA,matters. These steps have been put in place,82
NA,by the Minister for Finance and the Govern-,82
NA,ment for a significant time. This report does,82
NA,not give adequate weight to those sorts of,82
NA,issues.,82
NA,The honourable member for Cowper ( Mr,82
NA,"Nehl) spoke about the level of deficit, obliga-",82
NA,tions issues and so on. The Auditor-General's,82
NA,report is notable for not clearly defining the,82
NA,"cyclical issues relating to the economy, the",82
NA,deficit and the obligations that might flow,82
NA,from that and the more significant structural,82
NA,issues.,82
NA,"Looking at the deficit, what really matters",82
NA,is the capacity of the Government to manage,82
NA,the economy over time. The Auditor-,82
NA,General's report suggests that a long-term,82
NA,view should be taken about the management,82
NA,of the economy in the same way that a private,82
NA,company would develop its arrangements.,82
NA,Analysing what the Government has done,82
NA,"through the 1980s and early 1990s, that is the",82
NA,sort of management the Government has,82
NA,regarded as important. The Government did,83
NA,plan Budget surpluses throughout the growth,83
NA,period of the late 1980s and has recognised,83
NA,that present cyclical conditions mean that we,83
NA,have to move into deficit to regain stimulus,83
NA,and growth in the economy.,83
NA,The honourable member for Cowper sug-,83
NA,"gested an alternative strategy which, he says,",83
NA,is implied in the report. The alternative to,83
NA,having stimulus when the economy is re-,83
NA,cessed is to prolong that recession to make it,83
NA,more difficult to get the necessary growth·in,83
NA,"the economy, which creates hardship for the",83
NA,people the honourable member spoke about.,83
NA,"The Government, quite rightly in my view,",83
NA,has said that it will get the Budget balanced,83
NA,over time rather than adopt the knee-jerk,83
NA,"reaction that some appear to advocate; that is,",83
NA,"it can all be achieved in one Budget. Clearly,",83
NA,a threeto four-year strategy needs to be,83
NA,developed to get the Budget balanced. It,83
NA,cannot be achieved overnight. The net effect,83
NA,of trying to achieve that overnight would be,83
NA,to create more economic mayhem.,83
NA,What would be the result of that mayhem?,83
NA,All that would happen is that revenue would,83
NA,fall and more government expenditure would,83
NA,be needed to meet those liabilities. That is,83
NA,big problem with this report. The clear impli-,83
NA,"cation of a recession, such as the one we have",83
NA,"now, is that revenues fall because less tax is",83
NA,"paid, more unemployment benefits are paid",83
NA,and so on. That is precisely why the Govern-,83
NA,ment has acted in the way it has to create the,83
NA,necessary economic stimulus.,83
NA,The other aspect of why this report is so,83
NA,narrow can best be illustrated by the way in,83
NA,which a household budget is dealt with.,83
NA,Working on the sorts of presumptions con-,83
NA,"tained in the Auditor-General's report, it",83
NA,suggests that a household can fully meet,83
NA,"every one of its obligations at a given point,",83
NA,even though the house mortgage is planned to,83
NA,be paid over 15 to 20 years. Not one house-,83
NA,hold in the country would plan its decision,83
NA,"making on that basis and, quite frankly, nor",83
NA,would we expect it to. Yet it appears from the,83
NA,report that major public infrastructure should,83
NA,be accounted for and the Government should,83
NA,be meeting its superannuation commitment.,83
NA,That assumes that the complete liability for,83
NA,"superannuation will fall due tomorrow, which",83
NA,is most unlikely and is quite narrow in con-,83
NA,text anyway. It also assumes that the Govern-,83
NA,ment is not moving towards meeting its,83
NA,ongoing superannuation commitments. Both,83
NA,of those assumptions are wrong.,83
NA,The Government has taken positive steps,83
NA,over time to ensure that its superannuation,83
NA,commitments are more directly accounted for.,83
NA,"Earlier, the Minister for Finance referred to",83
NA,the reporting process that is in train for that,83
NA,to occur. It has occurred in the past and will,83
NA,occur in the future. Those things are there and,83
NA,are being done.,83
NA,To. suggest that one can take that in the,83
NA,fashion the auditor refers to again reflects an,83
NA,inappropriate application of what the audit,83
NA,report really should be designed to achieve.,83
NA,Certainly what we do need to achieve is,83
NA,greater emphasis on disclosure and accounta-,83
NA,"bility through those processes, but I do not",83
NA,think we need to conduct economic and fiscal,83
NA,policy with the narrowness suggested in this,83
NA,report.,83
NA,"Certainly, I think it relevant, as the Minister",83
NA,"for Finance said in his speech, to provide",83
NA,some comparative reflection of Australia's,83
NA,the position as against those of our international,83
NA,competitors on these sorts of issues. It is only,83
NA,through that process that we can really get to,83
NA,put aside some of the nonsense that is being,83
NA,"talked about, to put back into perspective",83
NA,"where our Budget position is, to understand",83
NA,"why we had those surpluses in the 19808,",83
NA,why we have had the deficits in more recent,83
NA,"times, and why we can manage our way",83
NA,through that process and get economic recov-,83
NA,ery going.,83
NA,The Opposition's approach to all these,83
NA,issues has been interesting. In the last three,83
NA,"years of the Parliament, what sorts of things",83
NA,did the Opposition say would occur? It said,83
NA,there would be a double-dip recession. It was,83
NA,wrong on that one. It said we would have a,83
NA,run on the dollar. It has been wrong on that,83
NA,one. It said interest rates would be going up,83
NA,"repeatedly through all that process, yet we",83
NA,have interest rates at the lowest level in 25,83
NA,years. So it was wrong on that one.,83
NA,The Opposition has gone on to make other,83
NA,sorts of similarly erroneous claims as to what,83
NA,the Government was going to do to the,84
NA,economy. It has referred constantly to the fact,84
NA,that the growth in the economy w- not going,84
NA,"to be sustained. Clearly, the Government is",84
NA,detennined to make sure that growth is,84
NA,sustained. One of the mechanisms to make,84
NA,sure that growth is sustained is to have re-,84
NA,sponsible Budget processes over a period of,84
NA,"years, with a medium-tenn strategy that",84
NA,demonstrates how we overcome the economic,84
NA,difficulties we have in Australia but at the,84
NA,"same time recognises that Australia's position,",84
NA,as compared with that of countries that we,84
NA,"deal with, is certainly responsible and sound.",84
NA,"Indeed, the auditor's report effectively demon-",84
NA,strates the soundness of our economy and,84
NA,makes the pointnot as strongly as it should,84
NA,be made-that the revenue side also has to be,84
NA,taken into account in these sorts of issues. It,84
NA,"has not been, as far as the actual report",84
NA,documentation is concerned.,84
NA,For those reasons this MPI represents a,84
NA,further attempt by the Opposition to talk,84
NA,"down economic recovery in Australia, at the",84
NA,very time when we need the Opposition to be,84
NA,prepared to come in here and support sustain-,84
NA,"able economic recovery, built on low infla-",84
NA,"tion, low interest rates and with the clear",84
NA,objective of ensuring our competitive position,84
NA,is enhanced versus those of our competitors.,84

NA,Minister explaining to the House why he deliberatetest,84
NA,ly misled the House in claiming that the coalition,84

NA,Amendment Bill 1993 which provides:,84
NA,(1) an additional free area of $30 per fortnight for Bill.,84

NA,(3) rationalises certain waiting period provisions,84
NA,for the unemployed;,84
NA,when the fact is that the Opposition has not voted,84
NA,against the Bill in the Senate but has only voted in,84
NA,favour of adding to the Bill its amendment to,84
NA,repeal sections of the Social Security Act which,84
NA,treat unrealised capital gains as income for the,84
NA,"purposes of the income test for pensioners, and,",84
NA,"further, the Bill as amended was supported by the",84
NA,coalition. Similarly in the House of Representatives,84
NA,the coalition supported the Bill at its second,84
NA,reading and today in the House voted to maintain,84
NA,the Senate amendment.,84
NA,The purpose of this motion is to give the,84
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Keating) the opportunity,84
NA,to come into this House and explain why he,84
NA,so misled it today.,84
Mr BEAZLEY ,Why are you so stunned?,84
Mr RUDDOCK,Why am I stunned that,84
NA,the Prime Minister misled the House? I am,84
NA,stunned that any Prime Minister would be so,84
NA,cavalier as to mislead the House-and know-,84
NA,ingly mislead the House-when it is a hang-,84
NA,ing offence in this place. According to,84
NA,"Minister Collins in the Senate this week, it is",84
NA,clearly a matter that would lead to the Prime,84
NA,"Minister's resignation, unless he is able, in",84
NA,"some way, to ameliorate the severity of the",84
NA,matter by apologising to the House and indi-,84
NA,cating how he came to make a mistake in,84
NA,relation to this.,84
NA,"Clearly, the Prime Minister made no",84
NA,mistake. I remind the House that he has been,84
NA,a member of this place longer than most of,84
NA,us. He knows better than any of us the con-,84
NA,"ventions, the proprieties and the arrangements",84
NA,for carrying a Bill through the Parliament. He,84
NA,knows better than anybody else that simply to,84
NA,amend a Bill does not lead to its rejection. To,84
NA,simply amend a Bill does not-,84
Mr BEAZLEY ,We will test it.,84
Mr RUDDOCK,The Government may,84
NA,"it in another place at another time, but",84
NA,"that is a separate issue. At this stage, the",84
NA,"coalition has not rejected, not knocked back,",84
NA,the Social Security Legislation Amendment,84
Mr BEAZLEY ,We don't know yet.,84
Mr RUDDOCK,The Prime Minister,84
NA,seems to know. If the Prime Minister had,84
NA,"said, 'We don't know but maybe, when the",84
NA,"matter is called on for a vote, we will oppose",85
NA,"it', that would have been a very different",85
NA,"proposition from his saying categorically, as",85
NA,"he did, that we rejected and knocked back the",85
NA,Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill.,85
NA,When Prime Minister Hawke was caught in,85
NA,exactly the same situation he was a big,85
NA,enough man to come into the House and,85
NA,admit that he had misled us.,85
NA,Mr Tim Fischer-Bob Hawke did.,85
Mr RUDDOCK,"Yes, former Prime",85
NA,"Minister Hawke, in relation to a matter raised",85
NA,"by one of my colleagues, was a big enough",85
NA,man to come in and admit where he was,85
NA,wrong. Perhaps the present Prime Minister,85
NA,"was badly briefed, but I noticed in an answer",85
NA,to a question in the Senate this week that the,85
NA,Government admitted to employing 310,85
NA,"additional staff who are in a position to assist,",85
NA,counsel and advise Ministers and to monitor,85
NA,what happens. One would think that with all,85
NA,those staffers the Prime Minister could get,85
NA,accurate advice about what happened in the,85
NA,Senate.,85
NA,The only vote in the Senate was a vote on,85
NA,an amendment to the Bill-a vote called by,85
NA,the Government and a vote which it lost. The,85
NA,only votes we have had called here today,85
NA,"were those moved by government members,",85
NA,such as the Leader of the House ( Mr,85
NA,"Beazley), gagging honourable members on",85
NA,this side of the House. The only ones moved,85
NA,by this side of the House related to whether,85
NA,or not the amendment from the Senate should,85
NA,be maintained.,85
NA,"Clearly, the Prime Minister was badly",85
NA,briefed. If he informed us that he was misled,85
NA,"by his advisers, I am sure we would be big",85
NA,enough to accept that. The Prime Minister,85
NA,"could come in and say, 'I have been here for",85
NA,20 years or more' -something he disparages,85
NA,"in others, although he even got that wrong",85
NA,"because I spent eight years in government, not",85
NA,opposition-'but I didn't understand the,85
NA,procedures and I made a mistake'. We will,85
NA,give him that opportunity in relation to this,85
NA,particular motion.,85
NA,I remind honourable members that I had,85
NA,something to say on this very issue before we,85
NA,voted on it. It may have been a little convo-,85
NA,luted because I was delivering my comments,85
NA,"without the aid of notes, but the intention was",85
NA,clear and unambiguous. I said:,85
NA,I want to make it very clear that it is not our intent,85
NA,to deny the benefits that were provided for in the,85
NA,original Bill to people who receive newstart and the,85
NA,other beneficiary arrangements in place for those,85
NA,who are unemployed. ''-,85
NA,There is no ambiguity about that. I said:,85
NA,I want to make it very clear that it is not our,85
NA,intent-,85
NA,Mr Sciacca interjecting-,85
Mr RUDDOCK,The Parliamentary,85
NA,Secretary to the Minister for Social Security,85
NA,was here when I said it. Perhaps he was the,85
NA,one who so briefed the Prime Minister on this,85
NA,matter that he misled the House. Perhaps he,85
NA,is the culprit. Perhaps the Prime Minister can,85
NA,make him the sacrificial lamb. The Parliamen-,85
NA,tary Secretary should apologise· to the Prime,85
NA,Minister for so grievously failing in the brief,85
NA,that he obviously prepared for him. The fact,85
NA,is that I made our position very clear. I,85
NA,continued:,85
NA,. . . nor do we want to inhibit the assets changes,85
NA,that the Government promised during the election.,85
NA,Our view is that the Government should implement,85
NA,its policy by supporting this Bill with our amend-,85
NA,ment.,85
NA,That is the fact of the matter. There was no,85
NA,rejection by the Opposition of the proposals.,85
NA,They were not knocked back by the Opposi-,85
NA,"tion, as the Prime Minister has asserted. I am",85
NA,astounded that a Prime Minister would put,85
NA,himself in a position where he comes into the,85
NA,"Parliament, so clearly misleads it and so",85
NA,clearly imputes to the Opposition an intention,85
NA,which cannot be imputed from anything we,85
NA,"have said, anything we have done, or any",85
NA,vote in which we have participated.,85
NA,If the Prime Minister wants to come in and,85
NA,use words like 'vengeful' and 'vengeance',85
NA,and impute some conduct to the Leader of the,85
NA,Opposition (Dr Hewson) which is totally,85
NA,"unreasonable and, on the evidence, totally",85
NA,"wrong in every sense, he should not do it in",85
NA,relation to an issue of this sort where he is,85
NA,using the vulnerability of the unemployed as,85
NA,a pawn in the political games that he wants to,85
NA,play. That is exactly what the Prime Minister,85
NA,was seeking to do: he wanted to use the,85
NA,unemployed and the pensioner community in,86
NA,Australia as pawns in his. political game.,86
NA,"The Prime Minister was really saying, 'If",86
NA,given the chance the Government would,86
NA,"blackmail you, the Opposition, on this parup",86
NA,ticular matter. We don't know what your,86
NA,intention is. We don't know how you are,86
NA,"going to handle it. But, if you are to press",86
NA,this matter to a point where ultimately,86
NA,"legislation is at risk, we would blackmail you.",86
NA,We would say that the only way this legislathat,86
NA,tion can go through amended is if it had,86
NA,support. We won't give you that,86
NA,"Therefore, the other provisions in the Bill will",86
NA,"fail, and that is on your head'.",86
NA,The Government cannot say that because,86
NA,we have not at any stage voted against the,86
NA,legislation. All we have done is positively,86
NA,vote for our amendments. The Prime Minister,86
NA,clearly misled the House. If he is a man big,86
NA,"enough to admit a mistake, he will be in here",86
NA,"now to apologise, and he would not leave it",86
NA,to others such as the Leader of the House or,86
NA,the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister,86
NA,Social Security to wear the blame.,86
Mr HOWARD ,Bennelong-Manager of,86
NA,Opposition Business) (4.57 p.m.)-I second,86
NA,the motion. The simple principle involved,86
NA,here boils down to whether the man holding,86
NA,the supreme office in this country tells the,86
NA,truth to this Parliament or not. Not even by,86
NA,using his not inconsiderable verbal skills can,86
NA,the Leader of the House ( Mr Beazley) explain,86
NA,away the fact that the Prime Minister ( Mr,86
NA,"Keating), who set out on an orchestrated",86
NA,"attempt to discredit the Opposition, got",86
NA,facts hopelessly and completely wrong. As the,86
NA,honourable member for Berowra ( Mr,86
NA,"Ruddock) said, if the Prime Minister really",86
NA,were the national leader that he aspires to,86
NA,"if he really felt a comfortable, secure Prime",86
NA,"Minister, a man not subject to the vulneraam",86
NA,"bilities of politics, he would be big enough to",86
NA,"come into this Parliament and say, 'Look,",86
NA,"am sorry, I got it wrong'.",86
NA,"His predecessor, Mr Hawke, did that on two",86
NA,occasions. The Leader of the National Party,86
NA,of Australia ( Mr Tim Fischer) will remember,86
NA,"one celebrated occasion, and I remember",86
NA,another occasion when the fonner Prime,86
NA,Minister made a stupid imitation of place,86
NA,somebody's accent. He later realised that he,86
NA,"had made a mistake, he came into the Parlia-",86
NA,"ment, and he was a big enough man to get up",86
NA,"and say, 'I am sorry, I got it wrong'. He went",86
NA,in everybody's estimation as a result of,86
NA,that admission. Far be it for me to say that,86
NA,the present Prime Minister could ever go up,86
NA,"in my estimation, but if he were to come in",86
NA,"this here this afternoon and say, 'Look, I am",86
NA,"sorry, I got it wrong; I withdraw, I apologise' ,",86
NA,would be the end of the matter and we,86
NA,our could both go out to Yarralumla and have a,86
NA,support. glass of champagne.,86
NA,But we should not hold our breath because,86
NA,he is not going to do that. To use his own,86
NA,"words, he is a spiteful, vengeful man-and",86
NA,"spiteful, vengeful people never apologise. The",86
NA,Prime Minister lives by the doctrine that says,86
NA,"you never resign, you never apologise, you",86
NA,"never say you are sorry, no matter what the",86
NA,circumstances are. That might be all right in,86
NA,"Sussex Street, but it is wearing a bit thin with",86
NA,the Australian public. I think the Australian,86
NA,for public is fed up with somebody who is not,86
NA,big enough to say he is sorry.,86
NA,"The honourable member for Berowra, on",86
NA,"behalf of the Opposition, has been sponsoring",86
NA,an attempt to restore a measure of justice to,86
NA,the pensioners of this country. He made it,86
NA,perfectly clear that he has not been trying to,86
NA,"tear down, frustrate or prevent the implemen-",86
NA,tation of increased benefits to those people.,86
NA,The Prime Minister cannot by any stretch of,86
NA,the imagination accuse the Opposition of,86
NA,opposing any of these measures. The Prime,86
NA,"his Minister misled the House, and he did it",86
NA,deliberately. He did not do it in the heat of,86
NA,the moment; he had a calculated attack,86
NA,"prepared, all written out in front of him. It is",86
NA,"be, inexcusable. He ought to come in here and",86
NA,"display the guts required of him and say, 'I",86
NA,sorry and I withdraw what I said'.,86
Mr BEAZLEY ,Swan-Leader of the,86
NA,I House) (5.01 p.m.)-The Opposition has been,86
NA,hoist with its own petard absolutely magnifi-,86
NA,"cently, and it is writhing in embarrassment at",86
NA,what it confronts with this particular matter.,86
NA,Far be it for the Opposition's spokesman on,86
NA,"social security, the honourable member for",86
NA,"Berowra ( Mr Ruddock), to wander into this",86
NA,and say that the Government trades on,86
NA,the vulnerability of the unemployed and the,87
NA,"pensioners, because that is exactly what the",87
NA,smart alecs in the Opposition in the Senate,87
NA,intended to trade on in this regard. What,87
NA,"have done, of course, is to compromise",87
NA,honour of the Opposition very,87
NA,compromise it on the point of a Budget,87
NA,measure put in by the Government in 1992 to,87
NA,oppose that-,87
NA,Mr Ruddock-Deal with the issues.,87
Mr BEAZLEY,Compromise it by holding,87
NA,to ransom the' position of the groups named,87
NA,in the motion put forward by the Opposition.,87
NA,Let us not forget that all the propositions,87
NA,forward by the Government in these areas,87
NA,"were, one way or another, opposed either in",87
NA,spirit or in detail by the formulations put,87
NA,forward by the Opposition in its election it,87
NA,campaign.,87
NA,Mr Thckey-Rubbish!,87
Mr BEAZLEY ," A load of rubbish, is it,",87
NA,for the honourable member for O'Connor?,87
NA,What does he think the implications are for,87
NA,people who are seeking unemployment benthe,87
NA,efits when the proposition here is,87
NA,"for those to be brought on more quickly,",87
NA,when those opposite are .looking for $900,87
NA,million worth of savings off it? Those opposthis,87
NA,ite went into the last election campaign,87
NA,looking for $900 million worth of savings out,87
NA,of the unemployed. These propositions will,87
NA,involve increased outlays in relation to people,87
NA,who are associated with the unemployed.,87
NA,do not try to hide behind some sort of fa-,87
NA,cade-,87
NA,Mr Ruddock-Not one vote against the Opposition,87
NA,proposal.,87
Mr BEAZLEY,They should not think in,87
NA,that they can clothe themselves in some sort,87
NA,of rectitude in terms of their views on unemthe,87
NA,ployed people associated with this particular,87
NA,motion. The whole spirit of this legislation is,87
NA,opposed by the Opposition.,87
NA,Mr Ruddock-Not one vote.,87
Mr BEAZLEY,The fact that the Opposi-,87
NA,tion has chosen to block it in the Senate,87
NA,simply hides its intention for the legislation.,87
NA,The Opposition was correctly flushed out by,87
NA,the Prime Minister ( Mr Keating)-,87
NA,Mr Ronaldson-He is a liar.,87
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,The honourable,87
NA,they member for Berowra will stop interjecting.,87
NA,the The honourable member for Ballarat will,87
NA,thoroughlywithdraw that comment.,87
NA,Mr Ronaldson-I withdraw it.,87
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,The honourable,87
NA,member for Berowra was heard in relative,87
NA,silence and I would appreciate it if he would,87
NA,let the Leader of the House be heard.,87
Mr BEAZLEY,The Opposition has been,87
NA,put caught out and it· knows it. It will have,87
NA,"another test, of course. Having blocked it",87
NA,"once, the test will be whether the Opposition",87
NA,will block it again. If the Opposition blocks,87
NA,"again, then it will find all the consequences",87
NA,that the Prime Minister referred to from a,87
NA,second blockage flowing through to the,87
NA,people who the Opposition says it is not,87
NA,wishing to render vulnerable. We will know,87
NA,all about that very shortly. There will be an,87
NA,opportunity to find out the veracity of what,87
NA,Opposition says when the next piece of,87
NA,effectively legislation is discussed.,87
NA,There are important things to hand as far as,87
NA,House is concerned relating to the presen-,87
NA,tation to the Governor-General of the Ad-,87
NA,dress-in-Reply in about half an hour or so. I,87
NA,do not wish to disturb that. I notice that the,87
NA,second Opposition speaker did not use his full,87
NA,So time; neither will I.,87
NA,The fact of the matter is that the Prime,87
NA,Minister has nothing to apologise for. The,87
NA,has something to apologise for. It,87
NA,will·have an opportunity to render its apology,87
NA,"the most effective way possible, to eschew",87
NA,"its initial blockage of this legislation, when",87
NA,matter goes back to the Senate some time,87
NA,in the next day or so. I move:,87
NA,That the question be now put.,87

NA,AMENDMENT BILL 1993,90
NA,Consideration of Senate Message,90
NA,Consideration resumed.,90
Mr BRADFORD ,MCPherson) (8.04,90
NA,p.m.)-I am delighted to have the opportunity,90
NA,to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation,90
NA,"Amendment Bill, and in particular on the",90
NA,amendment made to the Bill in the Senate. I,90
NA,take every opportunity to speak on veterans,90
NA,affairs in this Parliament; I have a direct inter-,90
NA,"est in the matter and, in some respects, one",91
NA,could almost construe a financial interest.,91
NA,"However, I believe that I have a responsibility",91
NA,to veterans to speak at every opportunity.,91
NA,As the Leader of the National Party of,91
NA,"Australia ( Mr Tim Fischer) said earlier, this",91
NA,Bill has been supported by the Opposition and,91
NA,to a very great extent it still has our support.,91
NA,We support the changes that the Government,91
NA,proposed to the assets test. We strongly,91
NA,support the changes to the definitions cover-,91
NA,"ing service in Cambodia, in the former Yugo-",91
NA,"slavia, and the peacekeeping service in Soma-",91
NA,"lia, effectively granting additional benefits",91
NA,Australian servicemen who served and con-,91
NA,tinue to serve with distinction in the areas,91
NA,which have now been determined to be,91
NA,operational areas. With the elections going on,91
NA,"in Cambodia at the present time, I observe in",91
NA,passing that the United Nations contingent in,91
NA,"that country is commanded by an Australian,",91
NA,Lt Gen. Sanderson. The troops under his,91
NA,"command have performed with distinction,",91
NA,and pf course a substantial number of those,91
NA,troops are Australians.,91
NA,"However, the Opposition remains implac-",91
NA,ably opposed to the Government's proposal to,91
NA,treat unrealised capital gains on veteran,91
NA,pensioners' shareholdings as income. We,91
NA,debated this matter at length this morning in,91
NA,the context of the Social Security Amendment,91
NA,Bill. The Government is treating the proposal,91
NA,in the context of this legislation exactly as,91
NA,treated it in the context of the other legisla-,91
NA,"tion this morning. In effect, we are being",91
NA,blackmailed-I do not use the word lightly-,91
NA,into ultimately supporting something to which,91
NA,we are strongly opposed.,91
NA,I do not think that I will change the mind,91
NA,of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister,91
NA,for Social Security ( Mr Sciacca) on this point,91
NA,"tonight, because we argued about it all morn-",91
NA,ing. It seems that the Government has made,91
NA,up its mind to proceed to tax unrealised,91
NA,capital gains on pensioners' shareholdings.,91
NA,"We were informed this morning that 60,000",91
NA,social security pensioners are affected by that,91
NA,"legislation. In the context of this Bill, 24,000",91
NA,veterans are affected by the proposal-and,91
NA,that concerns me greatly.,91
NA,Although the matter was argued at length,91
NA,"this morning, I do want to reiterate that we",91
NA,are opposed to the measure because it is,91
NA,unfair and it is totally unreasonable for the,91
NA,Government to have proceeded in that direc-,91
NA,tion. Veterans are very special people. Many,91
NA,"of them are now aged and, by and large, it is",91
NA,the aged veterans-veterans in receipt of a,91
NA,pension-who will be affected by this particu-,91
NA,"lar proposal. As I said, there are 24,000 of",91
NA,"them, and almost all will be adversely affect-",91
NA,ed.,91
NA,I do not expect that the Parliamentary,91
NA,to Secretary will be able to answer the question,91
NA,any more clearly tonight than he did this,91
NA,"morning, but I put it again: does the Govern-",91
NA,ment realise that the practical implication of,91
NA,this proposal is that people will be asked to,91
NA,live on less money than they have now?,91
NA,"There is no way around that unless, as the",91
NA,"Parliamentary Secretary admitted, they sell",91
NA,their shares or part of their shareholding. That,91
NA,is the despicable aspect of this part of the,91
NA,legislation: that we should say to certain,91
NA,"people-aged people; in this case the 24,000",91
NA,veteran pensioners-that they can no longer,91
NA,hold shares; that they no longer have the right,91
NA,that every other Australian has to own shares,91
NA,in a public company.,91
NA,I also posed the question of how far the,91
NA,Government is prepared to go in seeking,91
NA,"equity, as the Government calls it. When, for",91
NA,"instance, will it start to value their homes",91
NA,"it each year, or their cars? When does it move",91
NA,on to shares in private companies? The,91
NA,Parliamentary Secretary has already told us,91
NA,that they are not so marketable. Surely homes,91
NA,"are marketable, in a sense, although they are",91
NA,not traded on the stock exchange. The princi-,91
NA,ple of this proposal is so appallingly wrong,91
NA,that I cannot understand how the Government,91
NA,can argue for it.,91
NA,I am proud to be a member of an Opposi-,91
NA,tion which has clearly spelt out its position.,91
NA,In the Senate the Opposition successfully,91
NA,indicated our complete opposition to this,91
NA,particular proposal as it affects social security,91
NA,"pensioners and, in this case, 24,000 veterans.",91
NA,"As a veteran, I am concerned that the Govern-",91
NA,ment has failed us in the past. I would like to,91
NA,think that we could be bipartisan in our,91
NA,"treatment of veterans, but it is difficult to",92
NA,bipartisan when we see the treatment that this,92
NA,special group of people receives at the hands,92
NA,of this Government.,92
NA,In Question Time today the Prime Minister,92
NA,( Mr Keating) gave us an example of his,92
NA,attitude to this particular group of people. He,92
NA,underlined the deception that is inherent in,92
NA,"this legislation, and the Opposition attempted",92
NA,to take him to task for that before we went to,92
NA,dinner. He denigrates the flag at every oppor-,92
NA,"tunity, and for very obvious reasons the flag",92
NA,is precious-not in the sense that he is-to,92
NA,almost every veteran. Yet the Prime Minister,92
NA,continues his denigration.,92
NA,Today in this Parliament he compounded a,92
NA,previous error by publicly insulting Brigadier,92
NA,Garland who is the head of the premier,92
NA,veterans organisation. What the Prime,92
NA,Minister said does not bear repeating. If the,92
NA,Prime Minister denigrates the heads of veter-,92
NA,ans organisations and the symbols that veter-,92
NA,"ans served and died under, what can they",92
NA,expect of this Government?,92
NA,The Government's knee-jerk reaction to the,92
NA,Bushell case caused considerable anxiety in,92
NA,the veterans community. That piece of legisla-,92
NA,tion now appears to have been consigned to,92
NA,the scrap heap where it belonged in the first,92
NA,place. It set out to diminish benefits to veterplaying,92
NA,"ans, but there was little consultation with the",92
NA,veterans community. That is a constant source,92
NA,of anxiety. The Government was caught red-,92
NA,handed in attempting to reduce benefits to this,92
NA,very special group of people.,92
NA,The Government's next test will be its,92
NA,response to the Auditor-General's report No.,92
NA,8 on the Department of Veterans' Affairs.,92
NA,Veterans again genuinely fear that some of,92
NA,their benefits may be reduced or removed. I,92
NA,share their fear of the Government's response,92
NA,to that report. We will wait and see.,92
NA,"As I said at the start of my limited remarks,",92
NA,this legislation extends the benefits of having,92
NA,served on active service to servicemen who,92
NA,"served in Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia",92
NA,"and Somalia. However, many World War II",92
NA,"veterans are now aged, and some are suffering",92
NA,more each day. This sort of legislation,92
NA,"amounts to harassment, and they should not",92
NA,be harassed by this Government. Some of,92
NA,"be those veterans have shareholdings, and once",92
NA,again they will be concerned and worried at,92
NA,a time in their lives when they do not deserve,92
NA,to have that imposed upon them. This legisla-,92
NA,tion is petty and it should never have been,92
NA,proceeded with.,92
NA,I hope veterans and pensioners will bring,92
NA,enough pressure to bear-it has been brought,92
NA,to bear on backbench members of the Govern-,92
NA,ment-to have this particular aspect of this,92
NA,legislation and the former legislation thrown,92
NA,out. It is totally flawed not only in concept,92
NA,but also in execution. Nobody seems to,92
NA,understand how it is worked out. We will,92
NA,remain completely opposed to this legislation.,92
NA,(TIme expired),92
Mr SCIACCA ,Bowman-Parliamentary,92
NA,Secretary to the Minister for Social Security),92
NA,(8.14 p.m.)-Let me say to the honourable,92
NA,member for MCPherson ( Mr Bradford) that I,92
NA,have absolutely no problems with his sincerity,92
NA,when he says that these measures are unfair.,92
NA,"However, he is dead wrong; these measures",92
NA,are fair. I have already explained my reasons,92
NA,for saying that. This is the first opportunity I,92
NA,"have had tonight to say that, if anyone in this",92
NA,"House is denigrating anybody, it is not the",92
NA,"Prime Minister ( Mr Keating), it is those",92
NA,"opposite. In the Senate the Opposition, by",92
NA,theatrics and by including an amend-,92
NA,"ment to what is essentially a good news Bill,",92
NA,is in effect risking entitlements to UN peace-,92
NA,keeping forces that we have serving in Yugo-,92
NA,"slavia, Somalia and Cambodia-even 50 miles",92
NA,into Laos and Thailand.,92
NA,Those benefits will be at risk if the Opposi-,92
NA,tion'continues to oppose this Bill. Honourable,92
NA,members opposite play semantics. They muck,92
NA,"around with theatrics, as the honourable",92
NA,member for Berowra ( Mr Ruddock) did today.,92
NA,He made a big deal so that he could go and,92
NA,do a doorstop interview outside and make it,92
NA,look as if the Prime Minister had somehow,92
NA,misled this House. The fact is that the Oppo-,92
NA,sition was just playing semantics-it was,92
NA,"playing with words. The reality is that, if the",92
NA,Opposition continues to oppose both these,92
NA,"Bills in their present form, then it is endan-",92
NA,gering the benefits outlined by the Prime,92
NA,Minister today which will affect some,92
NA,"200,000 people.",92
NA,Mr Bradford-That is blackmail.,93
Mr SCIACCA,The honourable member,93
NA,for MCPherson says that it is blackmail. If,93
NA,"there is any blackmail, it is on the part of the",93
NA,Opposition. The fact is that the treatment of,93
NA,shares was something that was passed in,93
NA,December 1992 with the full acquiescence of,93
NA,the Opposition. The Opposition voted for it,93
NA,"then, and now it wants to go against it. The",93
NA,ball is clearly in the Opposition's court.,93
NA,If at the end of the day the Opposition,93
NA,"persists with this, we will make sure that",93
NA,"every one of those 200,000 people who will",93
NA,not get these benefits will be told whose fault,93
NA,it was-and it was not ours. I hope thatthe,93
NA,Opposition has some sense and decides to,93
NA,support the legislation. At the end of .the day,93
NA,the treatment of shares would still be the,93
NA,"same because that was passed last year, but",93
NA,the Opposition would be depriving veterans-,93
NA,the people the Opposition says it wants to,93
NA,"help, and I accept the sincerity of the honour- lenkins, H. A.",93
NA,able member for MCPherson-of benefits.,93
NA,I know that some of these measures are,93
NA,perceived by people in the electorate as being,93
NA,"harsh. However, there is no bottomless pit.",93
NA,"We are in government, not the Opposition.",93
NA,"Those ,opposite were rejected quite categori-",93
NA,cally on 13 March. We are in government;,93
NA,they are in opposition. We have to make the,93
NA,decisions. Sometimes those decisions are not,93
NA,going to make us popular with a certain,93
NA,"section of the population, but someone has to",93
NA,make those decisions-and we are making,93
NA,them.,93
NA,We are targeting the welfare dollar in the,93
NA,best possible way. We are answerable to the,93
NA,total Australian public; we are answerable to,93
NA,the taxpayer. We have an obligation to ensure,93
NA,"that, irrespective of the theatrics that have",93
NA,"been going on here all day today, that money",93
NA,is spent correctly.. The Government will be,93
NA,pressing ahead with the Bill the way it is. I,93

NA,"Knott, M. P. J.",95
Mr SCIACCA ,Bowman-Parliamentary,95
NA,Secretary'to the Minister for Social Security),95
NA,(8.51 p.m.)-On behalf of the committee,95
NA,appointed to draw up reasons for the House,95
NA,"O'Connor, G. M.",95
NA,"disagreeing to the amendment of the Senate,",95
NA,I present the reasons which are being circulat-,95
NA,ed to honourable members.,95
NA,The reasons read as follows-,95
NA,(1) It excludes shares and other listed securities,95
NA,from the definition of investment product in,95
NA,the Veterans' Entitlements Act and thereby,95
NA,prevents the equitable assessment of the,95
NA,ongoing gains made on shares and other,95
NA,investments listed on the Stock Exchange,95
NA,compared with indirect investments in shares,95
NA,through equity trusts.,95
NA,(2) The amendment will reduce the equity of the,95
NA,service pension income test. The assessment,95
NA,of ongoing capital gains on shares ensures that,95
NA,equity of the service pension income test is,95
NA,enhanced. Pensioners with the same means and,95
NA,the same financial resources available to them,95
NA,should' have the same amount of income,95
NA,assessed for service pension purposes. People,95
NA,who invest in shares should not be treated,95
NA,more beneficially than those who invest in,95
NA,"equity trusts or other managed investments,",95
NA,and they should not be treated more beneficial-,95
NA,ly than those pensioners who invest in income,95
NA,generating investments such as bank accounts.,95
NA,(3) The amendment would result in the expendi-,95
NA,ture of approximately $20 million in a full,95
NA,year on a group of clients who generally have,95
NA,substantial financial resources.,95
NA,(4) There is no reason why shares should be,95
NA,excluded and given privileged treatment. It is,95
NA,a principle of the income test that ongoing,95
NA,gains are treated as income for all investments,96
NA,that can be readily realised and utilised by,96
NA,pensioners for their support. Only those invest-,96
NA,"mentswhich are not readily realisable, such as",96
NA,real estate and shares held in private com-,96
NA,panies should be exempt. Listed shares can be,96
NA,sold in small or large bundles at any time,96
NA,allowing gains on listed shares to be readily,96
NA,utilised by a pensioner.,96
NA,Motion (by Mr Sciacca) proposed:,96
NA,That the Committee's reasons be adopted.,96
Mrs SULLIVAN ,Moncrieft) (8.51 p.m.)-,96
NA,As these reasons have just been put into my,96
NA,"hands, Mr Speaker, may we have the oppor-",96
NA,"tunity to look at them, as we did earlier",96
NA,"today, and decide whether we will adopt",96

NA,a matter of privilege. Just five minutes ago I,96
NA,witnessed what I believe to be disgusting,96
NA,behaviour by the honourable member for,96
NA,O'Connor ( Mr Tuckey). I was locked out of,96
NA,the division prior to the last one and I wit-,96
NA,nessed the honourable member for O'Connor,96
NA,burst through the door and push an attendant,96
NA,aside when that attendant expressly asked him,96
NA,"to remain outside the chamber. Of course, the",96
NA,rest of us obeyed her decision and remained,96
NA,outside.,96
NA,"Mr Thckey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of",96
NA,order. The honourable member has risen on,96
NA,a point of privilege and I think he should,96
NA,state his case of privilege which applies only,96
NA,"to members of this House. If not, he should",96
NA,"wait and move the appropriate motion, which",96
NA,is not a motion relating to privilege. I believe,96
NA,this is the ground on which he claimed your,96
NA,"attention, Mr Speaker. If he wants to move a",96
NA,"formal motion, let him do so and we will deal",96
NA,"with it, but let us not have these sorts of",96
NA,situations.,96
Mr JOHNS,I raise this matter of privilege,96
NA,because it offends my rights as a member that,96

NA,Second Reading,97
Mr LINDSAY ,Herbert-Parliamentary,97
NA,"Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tech-",97
NA,nology and Regional Development) (8.59,97
NA,p.m.)-I move:,97
NA,That the Bill be now read a second time.,97
NA,The purpose of the Customs Tariff Amend-,97
NA,ment Bill 1993 is to amend the Customs,97
NA,Tariff Act 1987 to put beyond doubt the,97
NA,construction of item 41A of schedule 4 to the,97
NA,Act. Item 41A is a key element of the legisla-,97
NA,tive mechanism for implementing the,97
NA,Government's passenger motor vehicle manu-,97
NA,facturing plan. From its commencement,97
NA,paragraph (a) of item 41A and the customs,97
NA,by-laws made in respect· of that item have,97
NA,always been intended by the Government to,97
NA,benefit only the five 'plan producers' by,97
NA,allowing them duty free importation of certain,97
NA,passenger motor vehicles where they have,97
NA,earned export credits under the export facilita-,97
NA,tion scheme in accordance with the plan and,97
NA,hold the appropriate determinations under that,97
NA,scheme.,97
NA,In extending the scheme with effect from,97
NA,"January 1991, item 41A was amended by the",97
NA,addition of a paragraph (d) to allow non-plan,97
NA,producers such as component manufacturers,97
NA,to benefit directly from export credits they,97
NA,had earned under the export facilitation,97
NA,scheme. Previously non-plan producers could,97
NA,only benefit through the sale of their credits,97
NA,to plan producers.,97
NA,It has recently been contended that these,98
NA,provisions and the customs administrative by-,98
NA,law could have allowed the dutyfree impor-,98
NA,tation of such passenger motor vehicles by,98
NA,importers not holding such determinations,98
NA,under the scheme. The Government's automo-,98
NA,tive policy sets out a schedule for the gradual,98
NA,reduction of tariff levels through to the year,98
NA,"2000. The intent of this policy, announced as",98
NA,"part of the 1991 industry statement, is abso-",98
NA,lutely clear. The policy reflects the,98
NA,Government's commitment to reducing assist-,98
NA,"ance to the automotive industry, but at a rate",98
NA,that is manageable and sustainable by that,98
NA,industry.,98
NA,The plan has provided Australia's motor,98
NA,vehicle and component manufacturers with a,98
NA,clear direction in meeting the challenges of,98
NA,motor vehicle and component manufacture in,98
NA,"the 1990s. Under the plan, motor vehicle and",98
NA,component exports have reached record,98
NA,"levels, exceeding $1.2 billion per annum.",98
NA,Confidence in the industry's future is reflected,98
NA,in recent decisions to upgrade and extend,98
NA,manufacturing facilities.,98
NA,The possibility of uncertainty in the,98
NA,legislative mechanism could seriously under-,98
NA,mine the benefits achieved to date. The,98
NA,industry has every right to expect that the,98
NA,plan will be maintained as previously an-,98
NA,nounced by the Government. The Government,98
NA,is therefore acting to preserve the integrity,98
NA,its automotive industry policy by expressly,98
NA,stating that for an importer to benefit under,98
NA,paragraph 41A(a) of the Act they must be the,98
NA,owner of a determination under the export,98
NA,facilitation scheme.,98
NA,Financial Impact Statement,98
NA,The' amendments will remove a potential,98
NA,liability of the Commonwealth to refund duty,98
NA,paid in respect of motor vehicle importations,98
NA,since 1 January 1991. But for the amendments,98
NA,the extent of that liability could be in the,98
NA,vicinity of $500 million. I commend the Bill,98
NA,to the House and present the explanatory,98
NA,memorandum to the Bill.,98

NA,and read a first time.,98
NA,Second Reading,98
Mr SCIACCA ,Bowman-Parliamentary,98
NA,Secretary to the Minister for Social Security),98
NA,(9.04 p.m.)-I move:,98
NA,That the Bill be now read a second time.,98
NA,This Bill contains a wide range of omnibus,98
NA,amendments to the various programs adminis-,98
NA,tered under the Social Security Act 1991.,98
NA,These amendments will refine the Govern-,98
NA,ment's .carefully balanced income support,98
NA,policies to make sure that members of our,98
NA,community in need receive the social assist-,98
NA,ance vital to them in difficult economic times.,98
NA,"Child disability allowance, or CDA, is paid",98
NA,in recognition of people Who care for disabled,98
NA,children at home. Several reforms in this Bill,98
NA,will improve the effectiveness of this import-,98
NA,"ant payment. First, it will become possible for",98
NA,plan's CDA to be shared between two people who,98
NA,share the care and control of a disabled child,98
NA,but one or both of whom do not receive,98
NA,family payment for the child. People who,98
NA,receive family payment as well as CDA for,98
NA,a child can already have both payments split,98
NA,of in this way and this amendment makes sure,98
NA,that the same treatment is given all round.,98
NA,The payment of CDA during a child's,98
NA,temporary absence from home' has proved,98
NA,difficult for administration of the payment. It,98
NA,is to be made clear for all new claimants of,98
NA,CDA that payment is to be made only while,98
NA,the child is being cared for in the family,98
NA,home and during specified respite or hospi-,98
NA,"talisation periods. Also, all current recipients",98
NA,of CDA will now continue to qualify for,98
NA,CDA while the child is in short-term hospital,98
NA,"care. Lastly, a limit of 12 months is to be",98
NA,placed on the backdating of CDA to the date,98
NA,"of another, similar claim. Earlier cases of",98
NA,backdating for five to 10 years had highlight-,98
NA,ed problems with collecting information about,98
NA,a child's disability or care requirements for,98
NA,such a long time in the past.,98
NA,This Bill allows parents who are granted,99
NA,prescribed education scheme payments for,99
NA,"their children to be paid, in certain circum-",99
NA,"stances, arrears of family payment back to the",99
NA,effective date of grant of the education pay-,99
NA,ment instead of just to the date on which the,99
NA,education payment was first made as provided,99
NA,now. This is a significant improvement for,99
NA,families in this situation.,99
NA,One of our important responsibilities to the,99
NA,taxpayer is to get maximum value for every,99
NA,"dollar of social security expenditure, and the",99
NA,debt recovery provisions in the Social Securi-,99
NA,ty Act help us achieve this. A range of,99
NA,amendments builds on these provisions. The,99
NA,Act will now specify how to calculate the,99
NA,amount of a debt that arises in some cases,99
NA,when a jobsearch or newstart allowance,99
NA,recipient's circumstances change during a,99
NA,public holiday period such as Christmas or,99
NA,Easter for which he or she is prepaid. If the,99
NA,client fails to return the usual fortnightly,99
NA,"income statement, there is currently no basis",99
NA,on which to calculate the debt. The debt will,99
NA,now clearly equal the amount of the prepay-,99
NA,ment in these circumstances.,99
NA,It is also being clarified that the debt,99
NA,arises when family payment clients underesti-,99
NA,mate their taxable income by more than 25,99
NA,"per cent, or fail to comply with the notifica-",99
NA,"tion provisions, is the difference between",99
NA,what has already been paid and the amount,99
NA,"due on re-calculation. Furthermore, an over-",99
NA,payment of family payment following a,99
NA,reassessment of taxable income will become,99
NA,a clearly recoverable debt.,99
NA,A redundant provision enabling the Depart-,99
NA,ment of Social Security to waive or write off,99
NA,Department of Veterans' Affairs debts is,99
NA,being removed. The Department of Social,99
NA,Security will still recover these Department of,99
NA,Veterans' Affairs debts when possible by,99
NA,deductions from current social security pay-,99
NA,"ments, but the department does not generally",99
NA,"handle other agencies' debts. Also, overpay-",99
NA,ments under the child support scheme when,99
NA,there is no continuing entitlement to child,99
NA,support will become recoverable by deduc-,99
NA,tions from social security payments.,99
NA,"Each year the department sends over 2,500",99
NA,cases of potential offences under the Social,99
NA,Security Act to the Director of Public Pros-,99
NA,ecutions. The penalty that applies to offences,99
NA,under part 8.1 of the Act is imprisonment for,99
NA,"two years, having been increased from 12",99
NA,"months in 1991. As a result, cases that had",99
NA,been dealt with summarily-by a magistrate-,99
NA,are often now handled as indictable offences,99
NA,by judge and jury. It has been decided to,99
NA,revert to the 12-month penalty so that the,99
NA,more appropriate means of dealing with,99
NA,offences may be consistently,99
NA,",",99
NA,employed.,99
NA,.,99
NA,Unemployed people have access to a wide,99
NA,range of labour market programs. The interac-,99
NA,tion of these programs with the social security,99
NA,system is being refined in this Bill by making,99
NA,sure that people who are paid for participating,99
NA,in the landcare and environment action pro-,99
NA,gram administered by the Department of,99
NA,"Employment, Education and Training or the",99
NA,ACT Government's jobskills program cannot,99
NA,simultaneously receive payment under the,99
NA,social security system. When they have,99
NA,"finished their training, these people can",99
NA,immediately return to the social security,99
NA,payment they were receiving before.,99
NA,People who are serving a newly arrived,99
NA,that resident's waiting period before being paid,99
NA,"jobsearch, newstart or sickness allowance will",99
NA,now be able to serve that waiting period con-,99
NA,currently with the ordinary waiting period that,99
NA,applies to most new grants of these allowan-,99
NA,ces. This will reduce the overall waiting,99
NA,period by around seven days.,99
NA,The New South Wales Medically Acquired,99
NA,mv Trust was established by the New South,99
NA,Wales Government to provide a package of,99
NA,financial assistance for people infected with,99
NA,medically acquired mv in New South Wales.,99
NA,"Through this Bill, the social security system",99
NA,will not be treating payments from the trust,99
NA,as income under the ordinary income test.,99
NA,This is in line with the Government's inten-,99
NA,tion for payments made by the similar Mark,99
NA,Fitzpatrick Trust that was established by the,99
NA,Commonwealth and covered by identical,99
NA,legislation last year.,99
NA,The rate of pension or benefit paid to,99
NA,someone whose partner is in gaol or psychiat-,99
NA,ric confinement following a criminal charge,99
NA,is to be clarified in this Bill in two respects.,99
NA,"First, to recognise the financial realities of",99
NA,"living apart from a partner who is confined,",100
NA,a person in this situation will now be paid,100
NA,higher rate that applies to a person without a,100
NA,partner instead of the rate nonnally paid to a,100
NA,"member of a couple. Secondly, it is being",100
NA,made clear that an additional amount is not to,100
NA,be added to a person's rate of benefit for a,100
NA,partner who is in gaol or psychiatric confine-,100
NA,ment and therefore being maintained by the,100
NA,State rather than by the beneficiary.,100
NA,"Last year, an amendment was made to the",100
NA,review of decisions provisions to channel,100
NA,applications for review by the Social Security,100
NA,Appeals Tribunal through the internal depart-,100
NA,mental review mechanism. This Bill makes a,100
NA,minor enhancement to that initiative to make,100
NA,"sure that,· if a person incorrectly applies for time.",100
NA,review to the SSAT instead of to the depart-,100
NA,"ment, he or she is taken to have applied to the",100
NA,department for internal review on the same,100
NA,date. This preserves the person's rights to be,100
NA,paid arrears should the review eventually,100
NA,decide in his or her favour as if the correct,100
NA,application had been made in the first place.,100
NA,The dual payment of mobility allowance,100
NA,under t4e Social Security Act and training,100
NA,allowance paid by the Department of Employ-,100
NA,"ment, Education and Training is being pre-",100
NA,vented by this Bill. This dual payment exclu-,100
NA,sion has applied so far only to people under-,100
NA,taking training as part of a Commonwealth,100
NA,rehabilitation service rehabilitation program,100
NA,but is now to apply to all cases of common,100
NA,entitlement to these two allowances. To,100
NA,further protect the integrity of Commonwealth,100
NA,"payments, it is being made clear that, where",100
NA,a person receives a payment by the Depart-,100
NA,"ment of Employment, Education and Training",100
NA,under the new enterprise incentive scheme or,100
NA,"the Aboriginal employment incentive scheme,",100
NA,the person's age or widow B pension will be,100
NA,"reduced. If the person receives age pension,",100
NA,his or her partner's pension might also be,100
NA,affected. This is consistent with the approach,100
NA,taken with other social security pensions and,100
NA,benefits.,100
NA,This Bill also makes some purely technical,100
NA,refinements not involving new policy in areas,100
NA,"such as investment income, family payment,",100
NA,the employment entry payment for sole parent,100
NA,pensioners and the impairment assessment,100
NA,tables for disability support pension. There are,100
NA,the also some minor technical amendments to the,100
NA,Act to ensure its integrity in terms of correct,100
NA,"references and tenninology, notes to the text",100
NA,and similar matters. I commend this Bill to,100

NA,Second Reading,100
Mr GEAR ,Canning-Assistant Treasurer),100
NA,(9.13 p.m.)-I move:,100
NA,That the Bill be now read a second time.,100
NA,"The main purpose of this Bill, the second of",100
NA,"two associated Bills, is to amend the Nuclear",100
NA,Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 to,100
NA,set the amount of the charge payable under,100
NA,the previous Bill and to specify when the,100
NA,charge is to be paid. This Bill provides that,100
NA,the annual charge payable for ASO safeguards,100
NA,activities by each uranium producer is,100
NA,"$500,000, or a lesser amount if the regula-",100
NA,tions so provide.,100
NA,I will say in my remarks on the next Bill,100
NA,that the uranium companies would pay no,100
NA,"more than is reasonable, having regard to the",100
NA,nature and costs of the relevant activities,100
NA,undertaken by ASO. This will be achieved by,100
NA,ensuring that the regulations annually specify,100
NA,"an amount, less than the upper limit in the",100
NA,"Bill, which represents the reasonable costs of",100
NA,the relevant activities undertaken by the ASO,100
NA,in that year.,100
NA,It is the Government's clear intention that,100
NA,the uranium companies will be fully consulted,100
NA,each year on the planned program of ASO,100
NA,"activities and costs and the charge proposed,",100
NA,before the final charge is set in the regula-,100
NA,"tions. In other words, company officials will",100
NA,sit down each year with the Director of,100
NA,Safeguards and other relevant officials and,100
NA,seek to agree on the level of ASO activity in,101
NA,relation to the companies' operations.,101
NA,"Naturally, the Government must retain the",101
NA,ultimate responsibility to determine the annual,101
NA,charge to ensure that the safeguards and,101
NA,physical protection programs fully meet all,101
NA,"requirements and obligations, so that the",101
NA,uranium mining companies may keep operat-,101
NA,"ing. However, the views of the companies",101
NA,"will be fully considered each year, and the",101
NA,Government will itself continue to pay for,101
NA,ASO activities which benefit the Government,101
NA,and the Australian community generally.,101
NA,The ASO's program of activities for 1993-,101
NA,"94 is of course not determined at this stage,",101
NA,so the charge for 1993-94 cannot yet be,101
NA,"specified. We have, however, arrived at an",101
NA,indicative charge based on ASO's 1992-93,101
NA,"program. On this basis, we estimate an annual",101
NA,"charge of about $340,000 for each of the",101
NA,uranium companies. The maximum charge,101
NA,"specified in the Bill-of $500,000 for each",101
NA,uranium producer-has been set to ensure that,101
NA,the legislation will not require freque-t,101
NA,"amendment. I emphasise, however, that 1t",101
NA,does not represent in any sense the charge,101
NA,that will in fact be payable by the companies,101
NA,unless and until their reasonable shares of,101
NA,ASO costs should approach this amount.,101
NA,"Finally, the intended sanction - the. event",101
NA,of failure to pay the charge prov1ded m the,101
NA,Bill is revocation of the permit to possess,101
NA,relevant nuclear material. Revocation is,101
NA,possible if permit conditions are not complied,101
NA,"with, and all relevant permits will require",101

NA,(9.17 p.m.)-I move:,101
NA,That the Bill be now read a second time.,101
NA,The .purpose of this Bill and the associat-d,101
NA,Bill is to impose a charge on commerc1al,101
NA,uranium producers in Australia to recover,101
NA,some of the costs of the Australian Safeguards,101
NA,Office ASO in undertaking nuclear safe-,101
NA,guar- and physical protection activities. The,101
NA,Government's decision to consider cost recov-,101
NA,ery for these activities was included in the,101
NA,1992-93 Budget papers.,101
NA,This cost recovery proposal rests on two,101
NA,"fundamental principles.· First, those who",101
NA,derive benefit from an activity should pay for,101
NA,"it, so long as the amount recovered is reason-",101
NA,able having regard to the nature and costs of,101
NA,"the activity. Second, those who pay should",101
NA,have a genuine opportunity to examine and be,101
NA,"consulted on the necessity, quality and cost of",101
NA,the activities they are paying for. This is,101
NA,"required not only on e9u-ty .gro-ds, -u.t also",101
NA,"because it imposes a d1sc1plme, m add1tion to",101
NA,"that of normal parliamentary scrutiny, on the",101
NA,provider of the activities-in this case the,101
NA,ASO-to deliver them as effectively and,101
NA,efficiently as possible.,101
NA,The ASO cost recovery arrangements to,101
NA,which the Bills would give effect will be fully,101
NA,"consistent with these principles. In particular,",101
NA,the the Government accepts that a substantial,101
NA,proportion of the activities of the ASO pro-,101
NA,vides benefits to Government and to the,101
NA,the Australian community generally. The costs of,101
NA,ASO activities not specifically directed at or,101
NA,relevant to industry will continue to be met,101
NA,"by the Government, which will remain the",101
NA,largest contributor to ASO resources.,101
NA,Other countries charge their industries for,101
NA,"nuclear safeguards and related activities,",101
NA,"including the United States, Canada and",101
NA,"Sweden. Moreover, cost recovery for under-",101
NA,"taking regulatory and other activities, based",101
NA,on the same general principles I have o-t­,101
NA,"lined, applies quite widely across Austrahan",101
NA,industry. In the prim- ind-tries and -n-r-y,101
NA,"portfolio, it currently apphes to a-t1V1t1es",101
NA,undertaken by the Australian Quarantme and,101
NA,Inspection Service and the Australian Fisher-,101
NA,"ies Management Authority, as well as to",102
NA,many of the projects of the Australian Bureau,102
NA,"of Agricultural and Resource Economics, the",102
NA,Australian Geological Survey Organisation,102
NA,and the Bureau of Resource Sciences. Activi-,102
NA,ties of the National Residue Survey and the,102
NA,registration of agricultural and veterinary,102
NA,chemicals are also subject to cost recovery,102
NA,arrangements.,102
NA,Before commenting on this particular Bill,102
NA,I will say a little about the ASO and its,102
NA,activities. Established by the Nuclear Non-,102
NA,"Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987, the",102
NA,Director of Safeguards and the ASO manage,102
NA,domestic and international nuclear safeguards,102
NA,and physical protection programs in accord-,102
NA,ance with our stringent nuclear safeguards,102
NA,policies and requirements.,102
NA,ASO has a key role in ensuring that urani-,102
NA,um produced in and exported from Australia,102
NA,is used only for peaceful purposes and is not,102
NA,"diverted into non-peaceful programs. In short,",102
NA,a significant proportion of ASO's program,102
NA,"exists, and the associated costs are incurred,",102
NA,because of the need to safeguard our uranium,102
NA,industry. These are the costs the Government,102
NA,has decided to recover. I shall return to,102
NA,point when commenting on the associated,102
NA,Bill.,102
NA,This first Bill provides in its substantive,102
NA,clause-clause 3-for a charge to be imposed,102
NA,on the companies which produce and export,102
NA,uranium in commercial quantities. Both Bills,102
NA,commence on 1 November 1993. III recogni-,102
NA,tion that it is reasonable for a producer to,102
NA,have generated a cash flow before being liable adjourned.,102
NA,"for the charge, we have provided that no",102
NA,charge is payable until some uranium has,102
NA,been exported from the relevant processing,102
NA,facility.,102
NA,The uranium industry has been going,102
NA,through a difficult period in recent years.,102
NA,"Prices have been low and, at the Ranger plant",102
NA,"in the Northern Territory, production has",102
NA,fallen and some workers have been retrench-,102
NA,"ed. Happily, prices have increased quite",102
NA,significantly in the last few months. Although,102
NA,the industry is by no means fully recovered at,102
NA,"this stage, I am pleased to note recent com-",102
NA,ments by senior officials of Ranger's parent,102
NA,"company, Energy Resources of Australia, that",102
NA,"the market has strengthened recently, utilities",102
NA,are showing an interest in talking about future,102
NA,"demand, and ERA has a number of new",102
NA,contracts under negotiation.,102
NA,I also note that Western Mining Corporation,102
NA,intends to increase uranium production from,102
NA,its Olympic Dam mine at Roxby Downs in,102
NA,South Australia as part of a mine production,102
NA,expansion program in the near future. Our,102
NA,decision to charge the companies for nuclear,102
NA,safeguards has not been made without regard,102
NA,to industry conditions. We estimate that the,102
NA,"two current uranium producers, both of which",102
NA,have remained profitable despite the industry,102
NA,"problems, will each pay only about $340,000",102
NA,"annually at the present level of ASO activity,",102
NA,representing about 20c per kilogram of urani-,102
NA,um produced. This is less than one half of,102
NA,one per cent of the present value of uranium,102
NA,production.,102
NA,"All in all, the Government believes these",102
NA,cost recovery measures-fully justifiable in,102
NA,terms of the principles I have outlined-are,102
NA,not unreasonable as regards the impact on the,102
NA,"uranium industry. Furthennore, the arrange-",102
NA,ments for detennining the .annual charge,102
NA,"this payable by the companies, which I shall",102
NA,describe shortly in discussing the associated,102
NA,"Bill, will give them a genuine opportunity to",102
NA,influence through consultation the actual,102
NA,amount they would pay each y-. I commend,102
NA,the Bill to honourable members and present,102
NA,the explanatory memorandum for it and the,102
NA,associated Bill.,102

NA,Reports,102
Mr HOLLIS ,Throsby)-On behalf of the,102
NA,Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public,102
NA,"Works, I present the first, second and third",103
NA,reports of the committee for 1993 relating to,103
NA,a housing development at Palmerston in the,103
NA,"Northern Territory, a housing development at",103
NA,"Flinders View near Ipswich, Queensland and",103
NA,"HMAS Waterhen facilities modernisation,",103
NA,"Waverton, New South Wales.",103
NA,Ordered that the reports be printed.,103
Mr HOLLIS,by leave-The first report,103
NA,which I have tabled deals with the constructhe,103
NA,tion of 210 dwellings at Palmerston in Darincrease,103
NA,win-70 of which will be for service persondemand,103
NA,nel and their families and the balance of,103
NA,houses will be offered for sale to private,103
NA,purchasers. The project will be undertaken in,103
NA,three stages at a net cost of $14.2 million.,103
NA,The committee has recommended that the,103
NA,project proceed as planned. The committee,103
NA,concluded that there is a need for the Defence,103
NA,Housing Authority to provide appropriate,103
NA,housing to cater for the increased Army,103
NA,presence in the north. The. site at Palmerston,103
NA,is ideally located for Army personnel working,103
NA,at Waler Barracks. The proposed construction,103
NA,"of facilities, comprising Waler Barracks, for the public.",103
NA,"the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, was the subject of",103
NA,an inquiry and report by the committee during,103
NA,1992. This proposal is therefore directly,103
NA,related to that development.,103
NA,"PaImerston, which was established in 1980,",103
NA,is located 22 kilometres east of Darwin and,103
NA,"currently has a population of 8,000 residents.",103
NA,The houses will be located in the suburb,103
NA,Driver and will be built on 114 lots. The,103
NA,proposed development has been designed to,103
NA,comply with local planning guidelines. ConAmberley,103
NA,siderable regard has therefore been given,103
NA,road patterns and the provision of open ·space,103
NA,which are reflected in the civic design,103
NA,cept and the landscape master plan.,103
NA,The houses themselves will comprise 91 facilities.,103
NA,"detached dwellings, 58 attached courtyard",103
NA,dwellings and 61 medium density dwellings.,103
NA,Features of the designs include: elevated,103
NA,floors; orientation to capture maximum,103
NA,ventilation and louvre windows for cross-flow,103
NA,ventilation; cyclone proof construction; metal,103
NA,wall and roof cladding; solar hot water; and,103
NA,ceiling fans and airconditioning of the living,103
NA,room and main sleeping area.,103
NA,House sizes and the numbers of bedrooms,103
NA,in each will be provided to meet service,103
NA,requirements. The designs will provide for a,103
NA,range of floor areas ranging from 115 square,103
NA,metres to 145 square metres. As I mentioned,103
NA,"earlier, the Defence Housing Authority pro-",103
NA,poses to provide 70 dwellings for service,103
NA,families with the balance of 140 being offered,103
NA,for sale to private purchasers.,103
NA,At the public hearing the authority advised,103
NA,committee that it may be desirable to,103
NA,this holding to 50 per cent should,103
NA,from the private sector be low. The,103
NA,140 committee was assured by the authority that,103
NA,it does not intend to establish an estate solely,103
NA,"for service personnel, but wishes to integrate",103
NA,service families into the general community.,103
NA,The second report which I have just tabled,103
NA,involves the development of a 53.8-hectare,103
NA,site at Flinders View near Ipswich to improve,103
NA,the standard of housing for defence personnel,103
NA,at the nearby RAAF base Amberley. The,103
NA,Defence Housing Authority proposes to,103
NA,construct 180 dwellings and the balance of,103
NA,370 dwelling sites will be offered for sale to,103
NA,Service and private sector housing will,103
NA,therefore be integrated within the proposed,103
NA,development. The estimated cost of the,103
NA,proposal is $31 million of which $18 million,103
NA,will be received from the sale of building lots.,103
NA,The committee has concluded that there is,103
NA,a need to provide suitable dwellings for those,103
NA,of service personnel from RAAF base Amberley,103
NA,occupying substandard houses and temporary,103
NA,rental accommodation in the Leichhardt and,103
NA,areas. The site at Flinders View is,103
NA,to well located for a housing development for,103
NA,service families due to its proximity to RAAF,103
NA,conbase Amberley and existing and proposed,103
NA,"local schools, shopping and recreational",103
NA,An urban planning concept was developed,103
NA,for the proposal. This aims to achieve a,103
NA,mixed density neighbourhood based on,103
NA,"integrated allotment, housing and road plan-",103
NA,ning design principles. Local housing pre-,103
NA,cincts have been designed to have the focus,103
NA,of a small village reserve or landscape fea-,103
NA,ture. Whilst the committee is generally satis-,103
NA,fied with the planning and design of the,103
NA,"proposed development, its report makes a",104
NA,number of recommendations in relation to the,104
NA,provision of specific features in the houses.,104
NA,"First, the committee has recommended that",104
NA,the Defence Housing Authority provide all,104
NA,dwellings with solar hot-water systems.,104
NA,recommendation is consistent with the stand,104
NA,taken by the committee on previous occaadvantages,104
NA,sions. Solar hot-water systems are a com-,104
NA,munity norm and the authority should demonshore,104
NA,strate its commitment to energy conservation.,104
NA,"Secondly, the committee has recommended",104
NA,that smoke detectors and earth leakage circuit,104
NA,breakers should also be installed in the,104
NA,"es. Again, the committee believes the proviwill",104
NA,sion of these features is consistent with,104
NA,community expectations.,104
NA,The report also makes a wide-ranging,104
NA,recommendation which involves the authority,104
NA,reviewing its design criteria to ensure,104
NA,service housing is as energy efficient,104
NA,"possible. However, the committee continues",104
NA,to be impressed by the progress made by,104
NA,Defence Housing Authority in improving the,104
NA,standard of housing provided to defence,104
NA,personnel.,104
NA,The third report which I have just tabledture,104
NA,"we have been a very busy committee already,",104
NA,"as you will see, Mr Deputy Speakerproposed",104
NA,concerns the proposed facilities modernisation,104
NA,"at HMAS Waterhen at Waverton, a harbourmaritime",104
NA,side electorate of North Sydney.,104
NA,Waterhen is the Navy's national mine warfare,104
NA,base. The committee has recommended that,104
NA,"the facilities modernisation, estimated to cost",104
NA,"$73 million at December 1992 prices, should",104
NA,proceed as planned.,104
NA,Mr MCGauran-What did Ted say?,104
Mr HOLLIS,"Ted might speak after me,",104
NA,so we will wait until after he speaks. In,104
NA,arriving at this recommendation the committives,104
NA,tee gave careful attention to a number of,104
NA,matters such as the need for a modernised,104
NA,"mine warfare base, the best location for it and",104
NA,the existing facilities at HMAS Waterhen.,104
NA,There is no doubt that the Navy needs,104
NA,proved facilities from which to operate its,104
NA,new mine warfare vessels which are planned,104
NA,for introduction in December 1997. The II.,104
NA,existing facilities at HMAS Waterhen would,104
NA,be inadequate to support the new minehunter,104
NA,coastal ships.,104
NA,Defence examined a number of possible,104
NA,alternative locations and the committee has,104
NA,concluded that the location of new purpose,104
NA,This built facilities in Sydney and at HMAS,104
NA,"Waterhen offers cost, support and operational",104
NA,over other options examined.,104
NA,The number of personnel to be employed in,104
NA,facilities and attached vessels is expect-,104
NA,ed to be 766. The proposed capacity of the,104
NA,shore element is to accommodate 377 person-,104
NA,nel· at peak levels of operation during a,104
NA,housworking week. The balance of 389 personnel,104
NA,be employed in attached vessels which,104
NA,will deploy and return to the base on a con-,104
NA,tinuing basis throughout the year.,104
NA,The main elements of the proposed work,104
NA,include a new operations and administrative,104
NA,"that building, a supply and clearance diving",104
NA,"as building, a technical workshops building,",104
NA,"waterfront and external works, a car park",104
NA,the building and relocation works. The com-,104
NA,mittee's report concludes that the scope of the,104
NA,proposed development can be justified on the,104
NA,basis of the functions of HMAS Waterhen and,104
NA,the number of vessels and support infrastruc-,104
NA,it will be required to support. Further-,104
NA,"more, the report concludes that, generally, the",104
NA,design and siting of facilities and,104
NA,other structures would not detract from the,104
NA,character of other facilities and,104
NA,HMAS structures in the area.,104
NA,"The report does recommend, however, that",104
NA,the final design of the proposed car park will,104
NA,need to reflect its environmentally sensitive,104
NA,location and that defence· should ensure that,104
NA,personnel to be employed on the redevelop-,104
NA,ment base use public transport to the maxi-,104
NA,mum extent possible. The latter recommenda-,104
NA,tion takes account of the views of representa-,104
NA,of local residents who appeared before,104
NA,the committee at the public hearing. I com-,104
NA,mend the reports to the House.,104
Mr MACK ,North Sydney)-by leave-I,104
NA,would like to support the recommendations of,104
NA,imthe Joint Committee on Public Works in,104
NA,relation to HMAS Waterhen because this base,104
NA,has had nothing done on it since World War,104
NA,It was in fact in danger of being listed by,104
NA,the National Trust. Unlike most honourable,104
NA,"members, I have spent a political career",105
NA,opposing government expenditure in my,105
NA,"electorate on things like roads, schools and",105
NA,technical colleges-which I know is unusual.,105
NA,The reason I have done that is the effects of,105
NA,those sorts of facilities on the very high,105
NA,density community of North Sydney.,105
NA,"In the case of HMAS Waterhen; however,",105
NA,I would like to compliment the Navy on the,105
NA,way it has gone about this project in elaborate,105
NA,consultations with local residents and the,105
NA,local council. The only quibble I would have,105
NA,with the project is the extent of car parking,105
NA,"on the base, on two basic grounds: first, the",105
NA,cost to the taxpayers because a couple of,105
NA,million dollars is proposed to be spent on car,105
NA,"parking for this base; and, secondly, the wider",105
NA,problem of subsidising and creating,105
NA,"overdependence on car usage, particularly in",105
NA,urban areas.,105
NA,This particular base does have a history of,105
NA,some trouble with access by motor vehicle to,105
NA,and from the site. I think the Government has,105
NA,to really look at all of its projects to try,105
NA,"reduce the overdependence on car usage,",105
NA,"particularly in urban areas, because we just",105
NA,simply cannot afford the costs in urban,105
NA,"sprawl, pollution, hospital costs and fuel",105
NA,imports. It makes a mockery of the,105
NA,Government's statement earlier today about,105
NA,reducing greenhouse emissions when one puts,105
NA,200 cars on a base such as this which is right,105
NA,in the heart of Australia's largest urban area.,105
NA,DELEGATION REPORTS,105
NA,Parliamentary Delegation to the,105
NA,European Institutions and the,105
NA,Netherlands,105
NA,NA,105
NA,leave-I present the report entitled The,105
NA,European Institutions and the Netherlands. I,105
NA,was honoured to lead the Australian parlia-,105
NA,mentary delegation to the European parlia-,105
NA,mentary institutions and the Netherlands in,105
NA,September and October of last year. I was,105
NA,fortunate to have with me such a fine group,105
NA,of parliamentary colleagues and to have the,105
NA,support and cooperation that they gave as,105
NA,representatives of this Parliament. I am proud,105
NA,"of the contribution that they made, the exper-",105
NA,tise that they brought and the competence and,105
NA,skills that they evinced through the discus-,105
NA,sions that we had. I think the overall impact,105
NA,of that delegation and its contribution was to,105
NA,strengthen Australia's relationships with the,105
NA,European parliamentary institutions and the,105
NA,Netherlands.,105
NA,The members of the delegation were: my,105
NA,"special colleague, in terms of cooperation,",105
NA,"support and assistance, the honourable mem-",105
NA,"ber for Bendigo ( Mr Reid), the honourable",105
NA,NA,105
NA,"able member for Gippsland ( Mr MCGauran),",105
NA,the honourable member for Fraser ( Mr,105
NA,Langmore) and Senator John Herron. We,105
NA,"were ably assisted, in terms of secretarial",105
NA,"backup, patience, understanding, attention in",105
NA,"a meticulous way to detail, by none other than",105
NA,the Deputy Sergeant-at-Arms of this chamber.,105
NA,In this respect we were exceedingly fortunate.,105
NA,Ms Dalma Dixon is not only a woman of,105
NA,remarkable patience but also a woman of,105
NA,"remarkable competence and attention to detail,",105
NA,which at some times we thought may not,105
NA,to have been justified but the delegation was the,105
NA,better for it. We were very happy to have her,105
NA,"with us and we say collectively, 'Thank you",105
NA,"very much, Deputy Sergeant-at-Arms, for the",105
NA,service you gave to our delegation and to the,105
NA,Australian Parliament'.,105
NA,"On behalf of the delegation, I express our",105
NA,appreciation to the following staff of .the,105
NA,Australian missions abroad who assisted us,105
NA,during the visit: the Australian Ambassador to,105
NA,"Belgium and the European Communities,",105
NA,"Ambassador Ted Pocock; the First Secretary,",105
NA,Hugh Borrowman; the Australian Ambassador,105
NA,"to The Hague, Mr Warwick Weemaes; Mr",105
NA,"John Monfries, counsellor; Ms Cate Steains,",105
NA,"Second Secretary; and Mr Leo Cruise, coun-",105
NA,"sellor, Australian Mission to the OECD. In",105
NA,"their respective areas of responsibility, all",105
NA,were of great help to the delegation. They all,105
NA,helped to ensure that we were able to repre-,105
NA,sent Australia at as good a level as possible.,105
NA,I also express our appreciation to the,105
NA,following two ladies: Ms Jan Furman and Ms,105
NA,Cheryl Harris from the gifts section of the,105
NA,Department of the Prime Minister and Cabi-,105
NA,net. I was a little puzzled at some of the,105
NA,recommendations that they made on appropri-,105
NA,ate gifts that we should make to the various,105
NA,parliaments and people whom we had to see,106
NA,"abroad. I understood, after I reached those",106
NA,"places and we made those presentations, that",106
NA,they had a level of knowledge and wisdom,106
NA,that we very much needed. Their choices,106
NA,were excellent and their contribution also,106
NA,needs to be recognised by this Parliament.,106
NA,I said at the outset that we had a fine group,106
NA,of parliamentarians. I think I would be fortu-,106
NA,nate amongst leaders of delegations to have,106
NA,had colleagues of the calibre that I had and to,106
NA,have had the level of cooperation that I had.,106
NA,"There was unanimity, a free-flowing expres-",106
NA,sion of views but most important of all a,106
NA,strong allegiance to Australia in putting the,106
NA,best view forward for Australia.,106
NA,Supporting my colleagues-a number of,106
NA,them were mentioned in the report-were,106
NA,"their respective spouses, partners and some",106
NA,members of families. I think they helped to,106
NA,add to the composition of the delegation and,106
NA,to the effect that we brought to our represen-,106
NA,tation to the European parliamentary institu-,106
NA,tions.,106
NA,Several issues were raised in the course of,106
NA,"discussions, among them the Maastricht",106
NA,Treaty. We were fortunate enough to be in,106
NA,Europe when the French referendum on the,106
NA,treaty was held on 20 September. The yes,106
NA,case was carried by the barest of margins-,106
NA,51.05 per cent-and it was clear that the,106
NA,issues involved related more to the domestic,106
NA,politics of France than to the merits of the,106
NA,treaty and what it meant to Europe as a,106
NA,whole. It was extremely interesting to see the,106
NA,interplay between the European nations: the,106
NA,"tensions; the difficulties of regionalism, or",106
NA,lack of regionalism in some cases; the princi-,106
NA,ple of subsidiarity; the feeling in some areas,106
NA,that they were not being properly represented,106
NA,by their nations in the debate about a single,106
NA,Europe.,106
NA,There was the issue of Yugoslavia. On page,106
NA,"37 of the report, it is stated in conclusion that",106
NA,the delegation was not fully persuaded that,106
NA,there was no possibility of an escalation of,106
NA,the Yugoslav conflict. Remembering that the,106
NA,report was put together soon after our return,106
NA,"in October last year, it is tragic that we have",106
NA,subsequently witnessed the bloodshed and,106
NA,mayhem of which we were afraid when we,106
NA,discussed these issues with our European,106
NA,colleagues.,106
NA,"As far as agricultural issues are concerned,",106
NA,those who had discussions with us came away,106
NA,with a better understanding of Australia's,106
NA,viewpoint and of the impact of foreign poli-,106
NA,"cies on our farmers, our livelihoods and",106
NA,agricultural economy than they had prior to,106
NA,the discussions. Whilst we could understand,106
NA,"their views to some extent, it was important",106
NA,for them to understand that we could provide,106
NA,foodstuffs to Europe much more efficiently,106
NA,and at much lower prices than they could with,106
NA,their heavy subsidisation policy. It was also,106
NA,important for them to understand what effects,106
NA,"the American enhanced agricultural program,",106
NA,"EAP, and the subsidisation of exports had on",106
NA,other producers.,106
NA,The desire to unify Europe into a single,106
NA,market with monetary union and associated,106
NA,"common security policies is strong but, as we",106
NA,"said at the time, the original timetable is",106
NA,ambitious. Looking back-the deputy leader,106
NA,"of the delegation, the honourable member for",106
NA,Bendigo will follow up this point-the con-,106
NA,clusions we drew at that time were accurate:,106
NA,the process is taking considerably longer than,106
NA,was anticipated.,106
NA,I think ours was a unique delegation in,106
NA,terms of the level of cooperation and consen-,106
NA,"sus achieved, but a recurring theme in our",106
NA,discussions was that the Europeans wanted,106
NA,some continuity between delegations. I am not,106
NA,putting in a plug to be the leader of the next,106
NA,"delegation-although it would be wonderful,",106
NA,it would be great-,106
Mr GEAR ,Totally modest.,106
NA,NA,106
NA,"to be so immodest, but that was the recurring",106
NA,theme. The Europeans found it difficult to,106
NA,"accept that, after establishing a rapport, an",106
NA,understanding and a feeling for issues with,106
NA,"one delegation, the next year there would be",106
NA,"a fresh cast of players .. If even one member,",106
NA,"the leader, or deputy leader were to remain",106
NA,"the same between delegations, there would be",106
NA,a sense of continuity. We have made recom-,106
NA,mendations on how that could be achieved.,106
NA,The final· matter is our address to the,106
NA,inaugural Enlarged Parliamentary Assembly,106
NA,of the Council of Europe on 2 October 1992.,107
NA,We were the first delegation to speak by right,107
NA,"to the assembly, and to address it as Austral-",107
NA,ians. I think that our contribution had an,107
NA,impact. We participated quite actively in the,107
NA,"committee stage of the council, we had an",107
NA,"impact upon the decisions that were reached,",107
NA,and we were also able to alter or fend off,107
NA,certain decisions.,107
NA,"Overall, it was a very successful delegation.",107
NA,I am proud to have had the honour to have,107
NA,"led it. I thank each of my colleagues, Ms",107
NA,". Dalma Dixon, our Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms,",107
NA,and all the others who helped us for their,107
NA,cooperation and support. I wish them well. I,107
NA,hope that we get the chance to speak with,107
NA,future delegations so that they will have a,107
NA,better understanding of what is involved. I,107
NA,conclude by expressing my special thanks to,107
NA,NA,107
NA,Relations Office who did a tremendous,107
NA,amount of preparatory work behind the scenes,107
NA,which made our task much easier.,107
Mr REID ,Bendigo)-by leave-I support,107
NA,the remarks of the leader of the parliamentary,107
NA,delegation to the European institutions and the,107
NA,"Netherlands, the honourable member for",107
NA,NA,107
NA,fine leader and welded together an excellent,107
NA,delegation which worked very closely to-,107
NA,gether in regard to the issues that were raised,107
NA,during that visit. We had some very good,107
NA,colleagues who brought a wealth of know-,107
NA,ledge and information about the Australian,107
NA,scene and the Australian economy and who,107
NA,participated ably in the whole process.,107
NA,It was certainly an exciting time to be there.,107
NA,The fortieth anniversary of the European,107
NA,"Parliament occurred whilst we were there, as",107
NA,did the French referendum on the Maastricht,107
NA,Treaty. We were able to gain a closer know-,107
NA,ledge of the current conflicts in the former,107
NA,Yugoslavian states. We have always main-,107
NA,tained strong links with the Netherlands and,107
NA,I am sure that the delegation's visit there,107
NA,strengthened those links. They will be further,107
NA,strengthened when we receive a visit from the,107
NA,Netherlands parliamentarians later this year.,107
NA,"Participating in debate, particularly on",107
NA,"agricultural matters, with my colleague the",107
NA,honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr,107
NA,MCGauran) in the Council of Europe in,107
NA,response to the OECD report was one of the,107
NA,highlights of the visit for me because it gave,107
NA,"the honourable member for Gippsland, me",107
NA,and the whole delegation the opportunity to,107
NA,participate in an issue which was very import-,107
NA,"ant to the Australian economy, the issue of",107
NA,subsidised food coming out of the European,107
NA,Community and the competition that Australia,107
NA,faced as a result.,107
NA,I think we made an impression in this area.,107
NA,When one participates in a debate like that,107
NA,and one can get the French delegates very,107
NA,"angry and excited, one has had some success.",107
NA,The honourable member for Gippsland and I,107
NA,put a few burrs under the French delegates',107
NA,saddles. They became quite agitated.,107
NA,Another important aspect of the delegation,107
NA,was our visit to the Australian war graves in,107
NA,Flanders and Ypres. We also attended a very,107
NA,impressive ceremony at Menin Gate. No-one,107
NA,left that ceremony without a lump in his,107
NA,throat. It was one of the most touching cere-,107
NA,monies that I have ever experienced in my,107
NA,life. I am sure that all of the delegation left,107
NA,with a greater respect for and understanding,107
NA,of the conflict that our own Australian service,107
NA,people were engaged in during that time.,107
NA,"I join the honourable member for Shortland,",107
NA,"the leader of the delegation, in thanking a",107
NA,number of people. I thank the Australian,107
NA,"missions and their support staff, who did an",107
NA,excellent job in supporting us and providing,107
NA,us with first-hand knowledge of what was,107
NA,occurring in each of the countries that we,107
NA,visited. I pay tribute to all of the people who,107
NA,have been mentioned by the leader of the,107
NA,delegation.,107
NA,I also want to express my thanks to the,107
NA,"Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms, Dalma Dixon, for",107
NA,her excellent guidance and assistance during,107
NA,that visit. We were under quite an amount of,107
NA,pressure from time to time because of tight,107
NA,"timetabling, none of which we regret now of",107
NA,"course, but it was pretty hectic at the time.",107
NA,"However, Delma was able to pull all of the",107
NA,movements together. I thank her for her,107
NA,"cooperation and assistance. All in all, the",107
NA,Australian delegation perfornied very credit-,107
NA,ably. I was pleased to be associated with a,107
NA,"fine leader, the honourable member for",108
NA,"Shortland, on that delegation.",108
Mr MCGAURAN ,Gippsland)-by leave-,108
NA,I rise to endorse the remarks of my colleagues,108
NA,the honourable member for Shortland ( Mr,108
NA,Peter Morris) and the honourable member for,108
NA,Bendigo ( Mr Reid). It was an unusually,108
NA,harmonious and united team. It was a remark-,108
NA,able experience and a tremendous privilege to,108
NA,be able to represent Australia in the visit to,108
NA,the European institutions and the Netherlands.,108
NA,I also wish to be associated with the thanks,108
NA,"expressed by the leader of the delegation, the",108
NA,"honourable member for Shortland, particularly",108
NA,to Ms Dalma Dixon for her work as our,108
NA,secretary. The honourable member for,108
NA,Shortland's leadership had a great deal to do,108
NA,with the very strong and enthusiastic mood,108
NA,that permeated the team from beginning to,108
NA,end.,108
NA,It was one of those delegations where we,108
NA,never tired and never wanted to miss any sort,108
NA,of meeting or discussion for fear of missing,108
NA,something substantial. It was termed a visit to,108
NA,"the European institutions, and it certainly was",108
NA,"that. In fact, we came away from Europe",108
NA,marvelling at the different number of institu-,108
NA,tions involved in the decision making which,108
NA,affects Europe as a whole. There was the,108
NA,"European Parliament, the Council of Europe,",108
NA,the European Commission Council of,108
NA,"Ministers, the European Commission, NATO,",108
NA,"the North Atlantic Assembly, the OECD, the",108
NA,"Strasbourg Conference on Democracy and, of",108
NA,"course, the different national parliaments that",108
NA,we visited.,108
NA,It was generally agreed by the delegation,108
NA,that this institutional structure is not one,108
NA,"can continue indefinitely in Europe, and there",108
NA,will have to be some sort of-dare I say-,108
NA,rationalisation; not that it is for me to preach,108
NA,to the Europeans as to what sort of institution-,108
NA,al structure they would wish to endorse into,108
NA,the future. But there is no doubt that even,108
NA,amongst themselves there are frank admis-,108
NA,sions that there is tremendous overlap and,108
NA,duplication.,108
NA,The honourable member for Shortland,108
NA,raised our discussions regarding the deteriora-,108
NA,tion-remembering this was last October-in,108
NA,the former Yugoslav republic. It was obvious,108
NA,that the suffering and the bloodshed to that,108
NA,date would be accentuated into the future.,108
NA,Wherever we raised it-and with whomever-,108
NA,"the reply was the same, 'There is nothing we",108
NA,can do. We are powerless to act or to,108
NA,"intervene'. The truth is that very few, if any,",108
NA,countries in Europe are going to shed the life,108
NA,of one young soldier for the Balkans. There,108
NA,was a complete paralyses then-as there is,108
NA,now-in how to respond to the butchery and,108
NA,"disast-i' that is now engulfing Bosnia, Serbia,",108
NA,"Croatia and, of course, does threaten",108
NA,Macedonia and one or two of the other former,108
NA,republics of the federal republic of Yugosla-,108
NA,via.,108
NA,It is a disaster. It was frustrating for the,108
NA,people involved. Do not think for a moment,108
NA,that the Europeans were not horrified at their,108
NA,inability to act-they were. They know that,108
NA,night after night the whole world is watching,108
NA,the slaughter unfold. It is on their doorstep.,108
NA,They have had a European community-at,108
NA,"least in name-for three or four decades, and",108
NA,"now, faced with this enormous problem, they",108
NA,are unable to even remotely solve it.,108
NA,The honourable member for Bendigo raised,108
NA,our discussions with various parliamentarians,108
NA,in the European Commission regarding,108
NA,agricultural subsidies. I think it is true to say,108
NA,"that we gave as good as what we got, if not",108
NA,"more, and we very forcefully put the point of",108
NA,view that European consumers were the losers,108
NA,in the high protection regime that encircles,108
NA,Europe. We made that point time and again-,108
NA,even to the extent where we were unofficially,108
NA,told that we may have been overplaying our,108
NA,that hand. I think that is largely explained by,108
NA,certain parliamentarians from well-known,108
NA,countries who were tired of debate and argu-,108
NA,ment with us.,108
NA,It was a tremendous privilege and a fasci-,108
NA,nating and enormously rewarding visit for the,108
NA,"delegation personally and, as a whole, I",108
NA,believe for the Parliament of Australia.,108
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Hollis)-I,108
NA,was pleased that the delegation was so harmo-,108
NA,nious. The European air must be different,108
NA,from the African air.,108
NA,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,109
NA,AMENDMENT BILL 1993,109
NA,First Reading,109
NA,"Bill received from the Senate, and 'read a",109
NA,first time.,109
NA,Second Reading,109
Dr THEOPHANOUS ,Cal well-,109
NA,Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for,109
NA,Health) (9.55 p.m.)-I move:,109
NA,That the Bill be now read a second time.,109
NA,This Bill amends the Health Insurance Com-,109
NA,mission Act 1973 to allow the Health Insur-,109
NA,"ance Commission to plan, establish and",109
NA,administer the child-care cash rebate scheme,109
NA,for expenses incurred for work-related child,109
NA,care as announced by the Prime Minister ( Mr,109
NA,Keating) on 9 February 1993.,109
NA,Under current Health Insurance Commission,109
NA,"legislation, the Health Insurance Commission",109
NA,is restricted to undertake preparatory work in,109
NA,relation to health insurance or other health,109
NA,related matters only. This amendment to the,109
NA,Health Insurance Commission Act 1973,109
NA,provides for additional functions for the,109
NA,Health Insurance Commission in respect of re-,109
NA,bates for child-care costs.,109
NA,"Under the new arrangements, the Health",109
NA,Insurance Commission can plan and establish,109
NA,a scheme which will allow the payment of,109
NA,rebates for child-care costs to parents who are,109
NA,"working, studying, training or seeking work.",109
NA,Such an amendment to the Act is required to,109
NA,enable the Health Insurance Commission to,109
NA,devote resources to develop and establish,109
NA,"systems and procedures to register carers,",109
NA,register eligible families and make payments,109
NA,under the scheme from 1 July 1994. The new,109
NA,arrangements will also enable the Health,109
NA,Insurance Commission to administer a child-,109
NA,care cash rebate as specified by an Act. Such,109
NA,a scheme will be specified in amendments to,109
NA,"the Child Care Act 1972, which is scheduled",109
NA,for amendment in Autumn 1994.,109
NA,The child-care cash rebate is part of the,109
NA,Labor Government's comprehensive child-care,109
NA,policy which recognises that most parents,109
NA,need quality child care at some stage of their,109
NA,working lives and that they need help with,109
NA,the cost of child care. The child-care cash,109
NA,rebate recognises that the cost of child care is,109
NA,a legitimate expense for parents in earning an,109
NA,income. The rebates will significantly improve,109
NA,the affordability of child care for working,109
NA,parents.,109
NA,"From 1 July 1994, parents using child care",109
NA,"while in employment, training, studying or",109
NA,looking for work will be able to claim a,109
NA,rebate for part of their child-care expenses.,109
NA,"An estimated 230,000 families, with 358,000",109
NA,"children, will benefit from the scheme. After",109
NA,"the first $16 of weekly child-care expenses,",109
NA,eligible families will be able to claim 30 per,109
NA,cent of their child-care costs up to a ceiling,109
NA,of $110 per week for one child in care and,109
NA,.$220 per week for two or more children. The,109
NA,maximum child-care cash rebate will be,109
NA,"$28.20 per week, or $1,466 per year, for one",109
NA,"child and $61.20 per week, or $3,182 per",109
NA,"year, for two or more children.",109
NA,The child-care cash rebate will be paid for,109
NA,any work related child-care expense for,109
NA,children aged up to 12 years. Child-care,109
NA,expenses incurred in formal child care-for,109
NA,"example, long day care centres, family day",109
NA,care and outside school hours care-and in,109
NA,"informal care arrangements-for example,",109
NA,with relatives and nannies-will be eligible,109
NA,for the rebate. Child-care expenses incurred in,109
NA,informal care have been included in recogni-,109
NA,tion of the fact that almost two-thirds of,109
NA,"working families use informal care, either by",109
NA,choice or because formal care is not available.,109
NA,Families will be able to claim the rebate by,109
NA,mail or in person at one of 240 Medicare,109
NA,offices around Australia. I commend this,109
NA,Bill to the House. I present the explanatory,109
NA,memorandum to this Bill.,109
NA,Leave granted for debate to continue forth-,109
NA,with.,109
Mrs SULLIVAN ,Moncrieff) (10.00,109
NA,p.m.)-I rise to state the position of the,109
NA,Opposition on the Health Insurance Commis-,109
NA,sion Amendment Bill. I think at the outset it,109
NA,should be made clear that this is nota debate,109
NA,about the Government's child-care policy; this,109
NA,is a debate about how the Government is to,109
NA,implement its child-care policy. The second,109
NA,reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary,109
NA,to the Minister for Health (Dr Theophanous),109
NA,"made that clear. In the Senate, when this",109
NA,"matter was being debated, the Minister for",110
NA,Family Services (Senator Crowley) said very,110
NA,clearly that this is not the child-care policy.,110
NA,She said:,110
NA,Nothing can be done in the area of implementing,110
NA,of cash rebates until the Child Care Act is amended,110
NA,later on.,110
NA,She went on to say that we shall not see that,110
NA,Bill until some time in the Budget session. So,110
NA,we are not tonight debating child-care policy.,110
NA,I say that because the Minister in the Senate,110
NA,to a large extent misrepresented the concerns,110
NA,that the Opposition had about this Bill. I,110
NA,would not like to see that repeated in here,110
NA,"tonight. So, armed with the foreknowledge of",110
NA,the sort of misrepresentation of the.,110
NA,"Opposition's position that took place,in the",110
NA,"Senate, I lay that out very clearly here.",110
NA,This Bill gives powers to the Health Insur-,110
NA,ance Commission to do something it does not,110
NA,"have power to do at the moment. At present,",110
NA,its legislation restricts it to undertaking,110
NA,preparatory work in relation to health insur-,110
NA,ance or other health related matters. This Bill,110
NA,will enable it to undertake preparatory work,110
NA,in relation to the Government's child-care,110
NA,"policy, not the implementation of the policy.",110
NA,"However, the Bill does rather more than",110
NA,just allow the Health Insurance Commission,110
NA,to undertake some preparatory work. During,110
NA,the debate in the Senate the coalition and the,110
NA,Australian Democrats expressed considerable,110
NA,alarm. The Bill breaks new ground in the use,110
NA,"of tax file numbers, to which the coalition has",110
NA,said it will not agree. We are agreeing to this,110
NA,Bill because we do not raise an objection to,110
NA,the Health Insurance Commission having the,110
NA,power to look at how something might be,110
NA,implemented. What we are objecting to is that,110
NA,the Health Insurance Commission has clearly,110
NA,no discretion in how this matter is to be,110
NA,implemented. I will refer in due course to,110
NA,some statements that were made during the,110
NA,"election campaign, in Senate estimates com-",110
NA,"mittees on this matter just very recently, and",110
NA,"in the debate on this Bill in the Senate, to",110
NA,illustrate those concerns.,110
NA,We will not raise any opposition to the,110
NA,"passage of the Bill, as I have said. We agree",110
NA,that the charter of the Health Insurance,110
NA,Commission should be broadened sufficiently,110
NA,so that it can examine implementation of the,110
NA,child-care rebate system. Our concern is that,110
NA,the Health Insurance Commission will clearly,110
NA,have no discretion in a vital part of the,110
NA,mechanism. It does not have the power to,110
NA,fully report on methods of implementation; it,110
NA,has been told the system has to be implement-,110
NA,ed in only one way. That instruction on,110
NA,implementation is a direct breaking of an,110
NA,election campaign undertaking by the Govern-,110
NA,ment on the subject of privacy. I will come to,110
NA,that in a minute. In the second reading speech,110
NA,"we have just heard, the Parliamentary Secre-",110
NA,tary said:,110
NA,The child-care cash rebate recognises that the cost,110
NA,of child care is a legitimate expense for parents in,110
NA,earning an income. The rebates will significantly,110
NA,improve the affordability of child care for working,110
NA,parents.,110
NA,Three cheers for the ultimate triumph of,110
NA,sanity and reason. I do not know for how,110
NA,many decades women have been saying that,110
NA,child care should be recognised as a legiti-,110
NA,mate expense of working where they are,110
NA,dependent children and they are their depend-,110
NA,ent children. For years the tax commissioner,110
NA,has been saying that this would require,110
NA,certain amendments to the legislation.,110
NA,For the last 10 years this Government has,110
NA,been under pressure on that subject. It has,110
NA,long since been an undertaking o( the Liberal,110
NA,"Party and the National Party, in a series of",110
NA,"election campaigns, that, if elected to govern-",110
NA,"ment, we would move to recognise the very",110
NA,basic principle that a parent who has the,110
NA,"prime responsibility for the care of children,",110
NA,and who needs to take on child care in order,110
NA,"to earn an income, has incurred that expense",110
NA,of child care as a necessary part of earning,110
NA,that income. Overwhelmingly this relates to,110
NA,women.,110
NA,For a very long time in this Parliament we,110
NA,have been told by the Labor Party that that,110
NA,was not the way to achieve the objective of,110
NA,fairness for women in relation to child care.,110
NA,We were told that the way to do it was to,110
NA,"subsidise the cost of child care. Finally,",110
NA,"obviously, the pressure has become too much",110
NA,for the Government and now there is a recog-,110
NA,"nition that, as the Parliamentary Secretary said",110
NA,in his second reading speech '. . . the cost of,110
NA,child care is a legitimate expense for parents,111
NA,in earning an income' and that:,111
NA,The rebates will significantly improve the,111
NA,affordability of child care for working parents.,111
NA,The coalition welcomes the fact that the,111
NA,Labor Party has finally got aboard on this,111
NA,issue.,111
NA,I will very briefly make one point that has,111
NA,not been widely raised in the debate but is a,111
NA,matter that the Government must address. The,111
NA,Parliamentary Secretary said:,111
NA,Families will be able to claim the rebate by mail,111
NA,or in person at one of 240 Medicare offices around,111
NA,Australia.,111
NA,"If this is the way that this matter goes ahead,",111
NA,a matter of very basic equity has to be con-,111
NA,sidered. The figure of 240 MediCare offices,111
NA,"around Australia sounds like a lot of offices,",111
NA,but it is not when one is talking about a,111
NA,"population like that of A,Ustralia.",111
NA,Until very recently my electorate included,111
NA,"rural areas, including the very significant rural",111
NA,"area of Beaudesert, and it still includes a very",111
NA,"long strip of the Gold Coast, which is a strip",111
NA,of provincial city population some 40 kilo-,111
NA,metres long. A very high proportion of my,111
NA,constituents are pensioners. Many people are,111
NA,in the position of having only one Medicare,111
NA,office to go to. Many of my elderly constitu-,111
NA,ents do not own motor vehicles and do not,111
NA,drive cars and it is a hardship for them to,111
NA,travel to this one office. Many times I have,111
NA,made representations for extra .Medicare,111
NA,offices and they have been rejected. I know,111
NA,that many honourable members have been in,111
NA,that position. There has been a view around-,111
NA,Mrs Crosio-Don't the doctors bulk-bill?,111
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Hollis)-,111
NA,Please continue to discuss the Bill and we,111
NA,will save the debates until later.,111
NA,Mrs SULLIVANI do not believe that,111
NA,that is a legitimate comment. If the non-,111
NA,provision of Medicare offices in areas of need,111
NA,is used as a stick to hold over doctors for,111
NA,"bulk-billing, then maybe we have yet another",111
NA,reason for there being so few Medicare,111
NA,offices. I must admit it is not one that I had,111
NA,thought of before. Innocent little me!,111
NA,I thought it was because the Health insur-,111
NA,ance Commission some years ago took on a,111
NA,huge computer with a capacity far outside its,111
NA,"needs, obviously with the ID card as part of",111
NA,"its planning, and it had to find a way to fill",111
NA,that capacity. A number of people who,111
NA,previously could make medical rebates were,111
NA,suddenly told that they could no longer.,111
NA,People had to do it by mail and the computer,111
NA,"could print out the cheques, but there is",111
NA,apparently another reason.,111
NA,I return to the Opposition's initial concern,111
NA,about the issue. A few minutes ago I referred,111
NA,to the breaking of an election undertaking and,111
NA,I would like to outline to the House precisely,111
NA,what that was. During the election campaign,111
NA,a concern was raised through newspaper,111
NA,reports that the Government was going to,111
NA,require child carers to provide tax file number,111
NA,"information to Medicare, administered by the",111
NA,Health Insurance Commission as a method of,111
NA,implementation. This raised concern.,111
NA,The Australian Privacy Foundation con-,111
NA,tacted the office of the honourable member,111
NA,"for Jagajaga ( Mr Staples), then Minister for",111
NA,"Aged, Family and Health Services, about it.",111
NA,An assurance was given by Minister Staples's,111
NA,private staff that a tax file number would not,111
NA,have to be provided to the Health Insurance,111
NA,"Commission. In other words, during the",111
NA,campaign a concern was raised in relation to,111
NA,the tax file number because a newspaper got,111
NA,a whiff of the Government's intentions re-,111
NA,garding this issue. When the concern was,111
NA,taken up and pursued by the privacy founda-,111
NA,"tion, Minister Staples's office hit it on the",111
NA,head. The spokesman from Minister Staples's,111
NA,"office did not tell the truth, because this Bill",111
NA,will enable the Government to implement,111
NA,exactly that policy.,111
NA,There was much waffling on the subject by,111
NA,the Government in the Senate. The Opposition,111
NA,was accused· of saying that the Government's,111
NA,policy was that child-care users would have,111
NA,to provide tax file numbers. I have read and,111
NA,reread that Senate debate. At no time did the,111
NA,Opposition say that. The Opposition just took,111
NA,the case as the Government put it and showed,111
NA,the dangers of that procedure. The public-,111
NA,people who care about the extended use of,111
NA,"the tax file number, which would be improp-",111
NA,er-were lied to during the election campaign.,111
NA,There is no doubt about that.,111
NA,The people who were making the inquiry,112
NA,did so very carefully and specifically. What,112
NA,was said was recorded. The person who was,112
NA,saying that this was not going to happen was,112
NA,told that it was being written down. The,112
NA,words that Minister Staples's staffer had,112
NA,as written down by the representative of the,112
NA,"privacy foundation, were read back to him",112
NA,over the telephone and it was confirmed that,112
NA,"those words were the Government's policy,",112
NA,including the denial that a tax file number,112
NA,would have to be given by child-care provid-,112
NA,ers as part of the implementation. What was,112
NA,"denied, absolutely and specifically, during",112
NA,election campaign is exactly what this Bill is,112
NA,about. At no time since has the Government,112
NA,responded to that. To the Government's,112
NA,"credit, it has not dumped the staff member,",112
NA,because the staff member was doing what he,112
NA,was told to do.,112
NA,The tax file number is unnecessary; never-,112
NA,"theless, the Government is determined to go",112
NA,ahead with it. The Government's policy could,112
NA,be implemented in a range of ways. As I have,112
NA,"said, tonight's debate is not about the policy;",112
NA,it is about the implementation. The Govern-,112
NA,ment could give these rebates in an utterly,112
NA,"non-offensive way-in fact, several non-",112
NA,offensive ways-but it has indicated its,112
NA,determination to pursue the tax file number,112
NA,course.,112
NA,During Senate estimates committee hearings,112
NA,a hapless public servant tried to obfuscate,112
NA,indicate that maybe it was not all set in stone,112
NA,"yet, but a few minutes later the Minister",112
NA,dumped that public servant and said that the,112
NA,decision had been taken and that this was the,112
NA,way it was to proceed.,112
NA,Estimates committee evidence also revealed,112
NA,that the commission had looked at a range of,112
NA,ways that the Government's policy could be,112
NA,implemented still using the Medicare office,112
NA,"device, but that the Government had instruct-",112
NA,ed the commission not to proceed with the,112
NA,"alternatives, that the tax file number device",112
NA,was the one that had to be proceeded with.,112
NA,"We have to ask why, in all the debate about",112
NA,the Australia card and its ultimate dumping,112
NA,and in all the subsequent debate about up-,112
NA,grading tax file numbers for the tax lurk,112
NA,purpose that the Australia card was supposed,112
NA,"to meet, the Government went to some pains",112
NA,"to say, 'The tax file number will not be used",112
NA,as a de facto ID card'. At least front bench,112
NA,government members did.,112
NA,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister,112
NA,"used, for Social Security has a couple of words",112
NA,"bubbling up, I can just tell. Maybe he did not",112
NA,think that. I want to make this very clear,112
NA,"point: the then Treasurer, the present Prime",112
NA,"Minister ( Mr Keating), very specifically",112
NA,undertook that use of the tax file number,112
NA,would not be extended in a way that would,112
NA,"intrude into non-relevant areas. There were,",112
NA,"the I admit, some government backbenchers who",112
NA,"put forward a different point of view, includ-",112
NA,ing the present Minister for Family Services.,112
NA,She put the view that if a tax file number,112
NA,were put in place it could be a de facto ID,112
NA,card. ',112
NA,Very significantly I believe-as does the,112
NA,Opposition-that there is a danger. If the,112
NA,Government is fair dinkum about not extend-,112
NA,"ing use of the, tax file number in a way that",112
NA,"is bound to cause harm and intrusion, it has",112
NA,"a range of alternatives. It could, of course, do",112
NA,"what the Opposition said it was going to do,",112
NA,and I would like to refresh the memory of,112
NA,government members on the Opposition's,112
NA,policy on this matter. Our child-care policy,112
NA,statement reveals that we would have admin-,112
NA,istered our child-care rebate scheme as fol-,112
NA,lows:,112
NA,and Individuals who provide child care on which a,112
NA,rebate is to be claimed will be required to register,112
NA,with the Tax Office. Each registered carer will then,112
NA,be provided with a Registered Carer's Number,112
NA,which must be quoted on all rebate claim forms.,112
NA,Parents will have the option of claiming the rebate,112
NA,"either fortnightly, in which case payment will be",112
NA,made in cash and available through Medicare,112
NA,"offices, or annually in which case the rebate will",112
NA,be calculated as part of the parents' tax return.,112
NA,The administration of this scheme by the,112
NA,Government and by the Opposition would not,112
NA,"be very different, with one critical exception.",112
NA,"The Government will require the carer, the",112
NA,"provider of child care, to give to the Health",112
NA,Insurance Commission a tax file number. The,112
NA,"Opposition was going to say to the carer,",112
NA,'Here is a registered carer's number'. That,112
NA,number would be given again by the Tax,112
NA,"Office, but there would be no revealing of",113
NA,that tax file number which can link into so,113
NA,many other things. It would be a special,113
NA,number issued by the Tax Office which would,113
NA,then be passed on to the person claiming,113
NA,child care to quote when obtaining a rebate.,113
NA,It is a very simple alternative system.,113
NA,Another alternative which was raised by,113
NA,Senator Harradine in debate and which was,113
NA,"not, I believe, properly answered-and I hope",113
NA,it might be better answered when we debate,113
NA,the actual system in the Budget session-was,113
NA,the possibility of looking at the plain tax,113
NA,rebate system. That is a possibility. The,113
NA,objection that the Minister raised was that a,113
NA,number of people-and she made it sound,113
NA,like a huge number of peoplewho would,113
NA,be benefiting from this provision are not,113
NA,"taxpayers. A number of them are not, that is",113
NA,true. A number of them are students or people,113
NA,who are undertaking further training before,113
NA,re-entering the work force or something like,113
NA,"that. However, when pressed on the issue, the",113
NA,Minister could give no break-down of the,113
NA,figures at all.,113
NA,I think that it should be possible to give,113
NA,some close notional figure. If one knew what,113
NA,the break-down was between tax paying,113
NA,people who are going to be looking for this,113
NA,child-care rebate versus non-tax paying,113
NA,"people, and then a break-down of the non-tax",113
NA,paying categories-at least a notional one-,113
NA,then it would be possible to construct some-,113
NA,"thing that would fit the situation. But, after",113
NA,"saying, 'No, we could not possibly do that",113
NA,"because so many of them do not pay tax', the",113
NA,Minister then could not give any clue at all,113
NA,"about how many that was. To me, it was just",113
NA,a way of dismissing the argument without,113
NA,"looking at the merits. Frankly, I am sorry to",113
NA,say that because I have a personal regard for,113
NA,the Minister. But in my opinion she ended up,113
NA,looking very foolish on that particular subject.,113
NA,"For the first time, service providers as",113
NA,against benefit recipients will have to provide,113
NA,a tax file number. That is breaking new and,113
NA,quite dangerous ground. There was a sugges-,113
NA,"tion some time ago, which the Government",113
NA,hastily dropped-and we might come to it in,113
NA,debate on the next health Bill-that pharma-,113
NA,cists should be linked into the Health Insur-,113
NA,ance Commission system. This was to be,113
NA,done for the sake of checking on the eligibili-,113
NA,ty for benefit of particular types of beneficiar-,113
NA,ies who presented with prescriptions. There,113
NA,was such an outcry about it that the Govern-,113
NA,ment had to drop the proposal that a service,113
NA,provider be linked into the system by com-,113
NA,puter.,113
NA,But now we come to what appears to be a,113
NA,very much more acceptable area of debate:,113
NA,that of child care. I am sorry to say that again,113
NA,the Minister doubled back and contradicted,113
NA,herself several times in the course of the,113
NA,debate. She got really very confused indeed,113
NA,about whether what was in this Bill was a,113
NA,proposal. After it was made very clear at an,113
NA,estimates committee hearing that the Govern-,113
NA,"ment had decided this was the way to go, she",113
NA,then tried to get out from under by saying,113
NA,that this was 'quite innocent legislation'. She,113
NA,then said:,113
NA,Nothing can be done in the area of implementing,113
NA,the cash rebates until the Child Care Act is amend-,113
NA,ed later on.,113
NA,I have already referred to that. She said that,113
NA,it was 'just a proposal' which the Health,113
NA,Insurance Commission was looking at. Saying,113
NA,'just a proposal' is like saying 'This is just an,113
NA,"idea and here you are, Health Insurance",113
NA,"Commission, kick this one around a bit; if",113
NA,you can think of a better proposal than this,113
NA,"""just a proposal"", then please make it'.",113
NA,The coalition made a proposal which was,113
NA,"ignored. But, more importantly, the Health",113
NA,"Insurance Commission has made, or embarked",113
NA,"upon making, proposals-that comes out in",113
NA,Senate estimates reports-but it was told to,113
NA,stop and get on with the tax file number. So,113
NA,when the Minister was saying that this was,113
NA,"'just a proposal', she was being too coy and",113
NA,too ingenuous by half. It is far more than just,113
NA,a proposal. The Government has taken a,113
NA,decision which the coalition urges it to move,113
NA,away from.,113
NA,"Of course, being so ingenuous and saying,",113
NA,'You don't have to worry about this. You can,113
NA,"happily support it, and when the proposal",113
NA,"comes along then you can debate it', means",113
NA,that we will have a re-run of what the Prime,113
NA,"Minister said, quite falsely, in Question Time",113
NA,about opposition policy in relation to social,113
NA,security and veterans affairs. We agree in,114
NA,"principle with the child-care policy, but we",114
NA,object to the detail.,114
NA,When this legislation proceeds and the,114
NA,Government goes ahead with the tax file,114
NA,"number proposal, we will vote against it in",114
NA,the Senate and the Australian Democrats will,114
NA,vote against it in the Senate. They have put,114
NA,the Minister on notice that they will not agree,114
NA,to the extension of the tax file number in this,114
NA,"way. They were talking about care providers,",114
NA,not recipients as the Minister tried to say in,114
NA,her reply during the second reading debate.,114
NA,It is very clear that both the coalition and,114
NA,the Democrats-and the Minister wanted to,114
NA,talk about something else-will not support,114
NA,"this legislation. If that happens, it will not",114
NA,through the Senate. Then of course the,114
NA,"Minister will say, 'But they voted for this Bill",114
NA,"back in May. They let all this go ahead, and",114
NA,here· they are trying to stop the child care.,114
NA,They are against child care; they are against,114
NA,women; they are against all these other,114
NA,things'. And that would not be true. But we,114
NA,have seen it enough times in this Parliament,114
NA,to know that that method of deceitful,114
NA,misrepresentation of debate is the standard,114
NA,way in which the Government handles its,114
NA,problems.,114
NA,I tell the Government now that throughout,114
NA,the recess the coalition will be making crystal,114
NA,clear what this Government is doing and how,114
NA,it has changed direction in relation to tax file,114
NA,numbers. We will be reminding the public,114
NA,why that system of identity cards was,114
NA,dropped. We will be reminding them of the,114
NA,outrage that built in this community at the,114
NA,linking together of certain types of very,114
NA,sensitive information. We will be reminding,114
NA,them that there was a fear when the tax file,114
NA,number was upgraded that this might be the,114
NA,ID card in another form. We will be remind-,114
NA,ing them in words of one syllable that the,114
NA,"present PrirneMinister, when Treasurer, intro-",114
NA,"ducedthe tax file number and said, 'This will",114
NA,not happen'. We will also be making crystal,114
NA,clear that we support rebates for child care,114
NA,and have been doing so for years. If we had,114
NA,"been in government, it would have been",114
NA,implemented by now. It is the Labor Party's,114
NA,views that have stopped those rebates being,114
NA,implemented before now.,114
NA,"In conclusion, as I said at the beginning of",114
NA,"my speech, this is not a debate about child-",114
NA,care rebates. That debate will come in the,114
NA,"form of amendments to the Child Care Act,",114
NA,as the Minister said. We are amending the,114
NA,Health Insurance Commission Act here,114
NA,tonight. We will then consider all of these,114
NA,"things fully, look at who is affected and",114
NA,consider the alternatives should the Govern-,114
NA,ment decide to go ahead with the implementa-,114
NA,tion of the tax file number. I urge the Govern-,114
NA,ment to make a decision; that it gives the,114
NA,Health Insurance Commission genuine free-,114
NA,dom to look at proposals for implementing its,114
NA,child-care policy and that it puts those propo-,114
NA,"get sals forward, as this Bill gives the Health",114
NA,Insurance Commission the power to do. The,114
NA,only thing that will not empower the Health,114
NA,Insurance Commission to do that will be if,114
NA,"the Government, through private directive-",114
NA,not through legislation-tells the Health,114
NA,Insurance Commission that it may not look at,114
NA,the alternatives but must instead stick with,114
NA,this so far unexplained but entirely obnoxious,114
NA,proposal of implementation of the tax file,114
NA,number for a purpose which we had been,114
NA,assured in this Parliament would never be put.,114
Ms HENZELL ,Capricornia) (10.27,114
NA,p.m.)-I find myself feeling the need to,114
NA,remind my colleague the honourable member,114
NA,for Moncrieff ( Mrs Sullivan) that I hope that,114
NA,"the Opposition will not be, as the Prime",114
NA,Minister ( Mr Keating) said in Question Time,114
NA,"today, revengeful and vengeful, that it will",114
NA,not go out in the recess and nitpick and have,114
NA,an absolute beat-up on the issue raised by the,114
NA,Health Insurance Commission Amendment,114
NA,Bill. It is quite clear from the second reading,114
NA,speech on the Bill that it is an enabling piece,114
NA,of legislation and that all bets will be up and,114
NA,available for people to fully debate the child-,114
NA,"care legislation. With this Bill, we will have",114
NA,to make sure that we have accountability. Of,114
NA,"course, whatever is finally decided, and the",114
NA,"recommendations that come back, it will be",114
NA,public money and we have to make sure that,114
NA,we are efficient and accountable as a govern-,114
NA,ment. I am sure the Opposition would want,114
NA,that.,114
NA,I return to the Bill. I think there are con-,115
NA,siderable areas of agreement between the,115
NA,Government and the Opposition on this,115
NA,matter. This enabling legislation will allow,115
NA,the Health Insurance Commission to provide,115
NA,the Parliament during the recess with some,115
NA,plans to establish and administer this scheme.,115
NA,We all agree that it is necessary to provide,115
NA,working parents with the ability to get some,115
NA,assistance-which is very essential-to enable,115
NA,them to look after their families and be,115
NA,productive in our economy. We are not trying,115
NA,to do anything by stealth. This very useful,115
NA,initiative that I believe really caught' the,115
NA,imagination of the electorate is to enable,115
NA,families to use the Medicare system to pro-,115
NA,vide this kind of facility for parents.,115
NA,The legislation that will come in in the,115
NA,Budget sitting will provide all the answers,115
NA,"and the reassurance, not only to the Opposi-",115
NA,"tion but also to the community, about how",115
NA,effective this scheme will be. The Govern-,115
NA,ment has been criticised for delaying the,115
NA,implementation of election promises. How-,115
NA,"ever, as both sides of the House would know,",115
NA,such new initiatives are administratively,115
NA,complex and must be set in place with due,115
NA,"process, hence this enabling legislation.",115
NA,We are asking the Health Insurance Com-,115
NA,"mission to allocate resources, establish sys-",115
NA,"tems and procedures, register carers, register",115
NA,"eligible families, and make payments to",115
NA,"families. Effectively, this legislation allows",115
NA,the Health Insurance Commission to plan and,115
NA,administer the scheme. I agree that there are,115
NA,250 Medicare offices across the country and,115
NA,the cost of implementing this scheme is $2.25,115
NA,million. Program and running costs will be,115
NA,outlined when the amendments to the Child,115
NA,Care Act are introduced in 1994.,115
NA,One of the very positive aspects of these,115
NA,proposals is the efficient use of existing,115
NA,government services to provide a further,115
NA,family support initiative rather than develop,115
NA,a new bureaucracy. The honourable member,115
NA,for Moncrieff is splitting straws at the idea,115
NA,the Taxation Office putting forward a new tax,115
NA,"number, some other way of identifying the",115
NA,child-care providers. It would seem to be,115
NA,"nitpicking to me. Of course, we will have to",115
NA,find some way of making sure that the trans-,115
NA,actions are codified but that will be presented,115
NA,as a range of proposals. I am sure there will,115
NA,be much debate in both Houses when the,115
NA,proposals are introduced.,115
NA,The Medicare office and what it symbolises,115
NA,"has become part of our national culture, and",115
NA,I firmly believe the threat to the viability of,115
NA,the Medicare system was one of the many,115
NA,aspects of coalition policy that led to the,115
NA,electorate rejecting the coalition at the recent,115
NA,"election. At the same time, the very positive",115
NA,proposals and track record of the Government,115
NA,on child-care options was one of the big,115
NA,winners for the Labor Party in the recent,115
NA,election campaign.,115
NA,These initiatives will further improve the,115
NA,position of Medicare in the national psyche as,115
NA,an outreach service by government to the,115
NA,community. Hopefully-and here is my,115
NA,further point of agreement with the honour-,115
NA,able member for Moncrieff-in cities such as,115
NA,"Rockhampton and other regional centres, in",115
NA,"Capricornia and elsewhere, there may well be",115
NA,the need for an extension of service delivery,115
NA,points which will enable easy access for both,115
NA,Medicare refunds and child-care rebates. It is,115
NA,certainly an issue of concern in regional areas.,115
NA,"Accessibility, both physical and temporal,",115
NA,is an important aspect of the proposed,115
NA,scheme. Families will be able to claim the,115
NA,rebate by mail or in person each week as they,115
NA,incur the cost for work-related child care. In,115
NA,"comparison, tax rebates, which the honourable",115
NA,"member for Moncrieff suggested, tend to",115
NA,favour higher income earners and there is,115
NA,often a long waiting period. Taxation deduc-,115
NA,"tions also disadvantage low income earners,",115
NA,"part-time workers and students, all of whom",115
NA,are much more effectively covered by these,115
NA,"proposals. At the end of every week, at the",115
NA,"point where the costs are being incurred,",115
NA,working parents will be able to recoup a,115
NA,portion of those costs.,115
NA,As the Parliamentary Secretary to the,115
NA,Minister for Health (Dr Theophanous) indicat-,115
NA,"of ed, once the first $16 a week has been put",115
NA,"forward, parents will be able to receive up to",115
NA,$28 a week for one child or $61.20 per week,115
NA,for two or more children. At the end of the,115
NA,week when hard-pressed families will be,115
NA,"trying to balance their budgets, that will be",115
NA,very helpful. The cash rebate will not be,116
NA,income tested and will be available to parents,116
NA,"working fullor part-time, studying or train-",116
NA,"ing, or looking for work. These are truly very",116
NA,effective initiatives and were very positive,116
NA,parts of the proposal put forward in the,116
NA,campaign. As the Minister for Family Ser-,116
NA,vices (Senator Crowley) noted in her second,116
NA,reading speech in the Senate:,116
NA,The child care cash rebate recognises that the cost,116
NA,of child care is a legitimate,116
NA,earning an income. The rebates will significantly,116
NA,improve the affordability of child care for working,116
NA,parents.,116
NA,"As the Parliamentary Secretary indicated,",116
NA,"some 358,000 children will benefit directly",116
NA,from this Labor Government initiative at a,116
NA,cost in the full year to government of $149,116
NA,million. Those families now receiving assist-,116
NA,ance through maximum fee relief will not be,116
NA,eligible for the cash rebate system.,116
NA,The child-care cash rebate scheme will be,116
NA,available for costs incurred where parents use,116
NA,both fonnal accredited child-care programs,116
NA,and infonnal arrangements such as family,116
NA,"members, neighbours and nannies. As we",116
NA,"know, two-thirds of parents use these types of",116
NA,"infonnal systems, whether this is through",116
NA,personal choice or lack of availability of,116
NA,"accredited child-care placements which, of",116
NA,"course, the Government is committed to",116
NA,improve.,116
NA,The power of choice is very important at a,116
NA,"number of levels. Firstly, it allows parents to",116
NA,seek the best quality child care for their,116
NA,children. At the second level it provides real,116
NA,encouragement for women to seek employ-,116
NA,"ment, to retrain, to study or to move from",116
NA,part-time to full-time employment. There is,116
NA,no doubt that the cost of child care in the past,116
NA,has been a real disincentive for women to re-,116
NA,enter the paid employment sector.,116
NA,As the report of the House of Representa-,116
NA,tives Standing Committee on Legal and,116
NA,Constitutional Affairs Half way to equal,116
NA,"noted, nearly 50 per cent of married women",116
NA,in the paid work force have children under the,116
NA,age of five. Seventy per cent have children,116
NA,between the ages of five and nine and all,116
NA,these children are requiring either full day,116
NA,"care, after school care or care in relation to",116
NA,shift work. I think it is important to recall,116
NA,what the report had to say about this very,116
NA,important social justice issue for working,116
NA,parents and particularly women workers. It,116
NA,stated:,116
NA,The paramount issue identified by the vast majority,116
NA,of submissions which dealt with women and,116
NA,employment was that of child care. The submis-,116
NA,"sions almost universally argued that good quality,",116
NA,affordable child care was the basic necessity for,116
NA,women to have a realistic choice as to their life,116
NA,expense for parents in options.,116
NA,I will refer to one other section of the report,116
NA,which stated:,116
NA,The fact that inadequate child care impacts so,116
NA,greatly on women rather than men in terms of,116
NA,workforce opportunities is a stark reminder of how,116
NA,society and largely parents see mothers as the,116
NA,"prime carers of children. Given this, there is a",116
NA,temptation to portray child care as a 'women's,116
NA,issue'. The evidence to the Committee strongly,116
NA,rejects this proposition and argues that child care,116
NA,is an economic and productivity issue as well as a,116
NA,basic test of the community's commitment to,116
NA,equity.,116
NA,There is no doubt that this debate has been,116
NA,going on for a long time and many political,116
NA,"representatives, many women's groups, have",116
NA,been advocating this position for a consider-,116
NA,able time. It certainly has been responded to,116
NA,by the Government in the New National,116
NA,"Agenda for Women, which made the point:",116
NA,"Child care is an issue for families, for employers,",116
NA,for unions and for all levels of government. We,116
NA,need to work together to build a strong child care,116
NA,program and to make things work both at home and,116
NA,work.,116
NA,"However, .it is important to see that over the",116
NA,last 10 years of Labor governments a great,116
NA,deal has been achieved. I disagree with the,116
NA,honourable member for Moncrieff in her,116
NA,interpretation of those events. Let us look at,116
NA,the facts. Commonwealth funded child-care,116
NA,"places have increased from 46,000 to 193,000",116
NA,"from 1983 to 1990, and the Government has",116
NA,"announced a commitment to ensure 250,000",116
NA,places by 1995-96. The Government has,116
NA,increased spending on child care from $65,116
NA,million in 1983 to $440 million in 1992. In,116
NA,1984 the Government made child-care fee,116
NA,relief available to low and middle income,116
NA,"families, and in 1991 fee relief was extended",116
NA,to eligible families using private and employ-,116
NA,er sponsored child-care services. Over,117
NA,"130,000 families were assisted in 1991.",117
NA,Th- Government's track record on the,117
NA,expansion of child care has been very credit-,117
NA,able. The commitment we are providing for,117
NA,"the future, as outlined in the new national",117
NA,"agenda for women, gives this Government a",117
NA,great challenge. I believe that we will meet,117
NA,"that challenge. We will work with the State,",117
NA,"Territory and local governments, community",117
NA,groups and employers to increase child-care,117
NA,"places, with a commitment of 250 child-care",117
NA,places by 1996.,117
NA,The Government is also committed to,117
NA,improving the accreditation of child care so,117
NA,that we ptovide quality child care. It is very,117
NA,important not only that child care be afford-,117
NA,"able but also that working parents know that,",117
NA,when their children are being cared for away,117
NA,"from direct parental supervision, the quality",117
NA,of that care is excellent. The program outlined,117
NA,during the campaign was a real winner for,117
NA,this Government. I have absolute confidence,117
NA,that both sides can look forward to the new,117
NA,legislation with confidence.,117
NA,"In summary, this enabling legislation is one",117
NA,more step in a proud record of achievement,117
NA,by Labor governments in this country to,117
NA,address the issues of quality and affordable,117
NA,'child care. It is very important that we main-,117
NA,tain the important issues. The quality of the,117
NA,"child care that we provide, the access and the",117
NA,social justice that is involved in providing,117
NA,are absolutely important to the future develop-,117
NA,ment of our children and our country's future.,117
NA,It is very easy for me to commend this Bill to,117
NA,the House.,117
Ms DEAHM ,Macquarie) (10.41 p.m.)-I,117
NA,will be brief and I will not repeat any of the,117
NA,comments that have already been made. I,117
NA,fully endorse the words of the honourable,117
NA,member for Capricomia (Ms Henzell). In,117
NA,supporting the Health Insurance Commission,117
NA,"Amendment Bill, I wish to point out its wider",117
NA,implications and also its historical signifi-,117
NA,cance.,117
NA,When I first entered the work force at the,117
NA,age of I5-that was. in 1955; if honourable,117
NA,"members have their calculators at hand, they",117
NA,can work out how old I am-it was accepted,117
NA,that girls worked until they got married. They,117
NA,left work when they got married to become,117
NA,"full-time homemakers, child-bearers and child",117
NA,carers. The only women who worked were,117
NA,highly professional women-they were in the,117
NA,"minority, as they still are in many places-or",117
NA,extremely poor women who had to work in,117
NA,order to keep the family. This was certainly,117
NA,looked down on at that time. I certainly did,117
NA,not live in a very well-off area. The question,117
NA,of child care did not really arise at that time.,117
NA,"Further on in my life, like a lot of older",117
NA,"women, I undertook a tertiary degree. I did",117
NA,this by external study. I met a lot of women,117
NA,who had gone through those stages of,117
NA,"homemaking, child-bearing and now, in their",117
NA,"middle age, wished to join the work force. By",117
NA,that time it was accepted that it was all right,117
NA,"for women to work in their own careers, not",117
NA,just for economic reasons. This has been one,117
NA,of the biggest breakthroughs for women and,117
NA,for families as a whole. It is accepted that,117
NA,women do have careers and can have a life of,117
NA,their own in the work force and not just be,117
NA,dependent.,117
NA,I met a lot of very interesting women at,117
NA,university who were studying by that particu-,117
NA,lar method because they could not leave their,117
NA,children. Many went through difficult times,117
NA,with their marriages and their families be-,117
NA,cause they wanted a career of their own and,117
NA,they wanted to study. I saw marriages break,117
NA,up and I saw others consolidate. Child care,117
NA,this was a very integral part of this. It is now,117
NA,"generally accepted, as I have said, that women",117
NA,can have careers of their own. Child care is,117
NA,being more and more accepted in the work-,117
NA,place and in the community.,117
NA,It is significant that several new members,117
NA,of this House have advocated the provision of,117
NA,child care in this place. Mr Speaker is looking,117
NA,at the facilities that can be provided. Women,117
NA,were discouraged from entering parliament,117
NA,"until they reached a matur- age, like me,",117
NA,because of that problem. The honourable,117
NA,member for Lowe ( Mrs Easson) is a good,117
NA,example of a woman who has taken on this,117
NA,role while she has two young children. In the,117
NA,New South Wales Parliament at the moment,117
NA,a new member of the Ministry has borne a,117
NA,child during her time as a member of parlia-,117
NA,ment. When asked how she was going to,117
NA,"handle a ministerial position, she said that",118
NA,one-year-old child was cared for in the Parlia- work force.,118
NA,"ment House child-care centre. Obviously,",118
NA,New South Wales has done something about,118
NA,this.,118
NA,The more facilities that we have provided,118
NA,"in the workplace and in the community, the",118
NA,more scope women will have for furthering,118
NA,"their careers. However, in saying that, we are",118
NA,not discouraging women who wish to stay at,118
NA,home· to look after their children. Another,118
NA,election promise which will be honoured is to,118
NA,provide extra assistance for women who,118
NA,choose to stay at home to look after their,118
NA,"children. In my electorate, which is not quite",118
NA,the same size as that of the honourable mem-,118
NA,ber for Capricornia-although we do have,118
NA,quite a lot of isolated places-there are,118
NA,insufficient child-care places. With this,118
NA,provision I think we will see the development,118
NA,of more of those places. It is certainly some-,118
NA,thing I will be working for over the next three,118
NA,"years and, hopefully, beyond.",118
NA,The honourable member for Capricornia,118
NA,also alluded to the fact that child care is now,118
NA,"accepted as an economic issue, and I com-",118
NA,mend the Prime Minister ( Mr Keating) for,118
NA,announcing these child-care measures as part,118
NA,of his economic statement. Child care is no,118
NA,longer just a welfare issue or a women's,118
NA,"issue-indeed, it is not just a women's issue.",118
NA,I have already found in my short term as a,118
NA,member of Parliament that there are men who,118
NA,are child carers and who find themselves in,118
NA,an extremely difficult position when they,118
NA,become sole parents. So those child-care,118
NA,places and child-care rebates will also be of,118
NA,great advantage to men.,118
NA,I will not say any more than that. I wanted,118
NA,the House to realise that this is an historic,118
NA,"Bill. It will be more fully debated, as has",118
NA,"been said, under the child-care legislation in",118
NA,"the next sessiof,l. It must not pass without",118
NA,acknowledging that we have come a long,118
NA,"way, even though it has been slow. The",118
NA,"development of opportunities for women, of",118
NA,"which child care has been a great part, has",118
NA,"been slow, but the opportunities are increas-",118
NA,"ing. There are more women in this place now,",118
NA,and there will be more in the future. Child,118
NA,care is an integral part of enabling those,118
NA,her people to become productive members of the,118
Dr THEOPHANOUS ,Calwell-Parlia-,118
NA,mentary Secretary to the Minister for Hous-,118
NA,"ing, Local Government and Community",118
NA,Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the,118
NA,Minister for Health) (10.47 p.m.)-in reply-I,118
NA,commend the speeches of the honourable,118
NA,member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) and the,118
NA,honourable member for Macquarie (Ms,118
NA,Deahm) on the Health Insurance Commission,118
NA,Amendment Bill. I concur with the comment,118
NA,of the honourable member for Macquarie that,118
NA,"this is an historic piece of legislation, espe-",118
NA,cially in the area of women's rights. Although,118
NA,the honourable member for Moncrieff ( Mrs,118
NA,Sullivan) tried to represent it as only a small,118
NA,"step, in fact, it is one of the most important",118
NA,and significant steps because it commits the,118
NA,Government to a timetable to implement the,118
NA,changes and to develop the full system to,118
NA,bring before this Parliament.,118
NA,One could not imagine anything more,118
NA,"democratic than that. Firstly, the commitment",118
NA,"was made in the election. Secondly, the",118
NA,Government brought in the enabling legisla-,118
NA,tion to study ways and means of bringing in,118
NA,the whole process and to allow the planning,118
NA,towards implementation to take place. Third-,118
NA,"ly, the legislation allows for a situation where",118
NA,there is discussion in the public arena. .,118
NA,The honourable member for Moncrieff,118
NA,chose not to compliment the Government for,118
NA,the speedy implementation of an election,118
NA,promise. We have heard a lot of nonsense,118
NA,from the Opposition and some of the media,118
NA,about the Government not meeting election,118
NA,"promises, but here is an historic piece of",118
NA,legislation that will meet a very important,118
NA,"election promise, especially with respect to",118
NA,the rights of women. The honourable member,118
NA,"for Moncrieff hardly emphasised that. Instead,",118
NA,our she ranged widely in her discussion. She even,118
NA,referred to the comments earlier today of the,118
NA,"Prime Minister ( Mr Keating) when she said,",118
NA,"'Look, if we block this legislation because of",118
NA,the so-called concern which is raised about,118
NA,the tax file number' -and I will return to th-t,118
NA,in a minute-' and if we block this legislation,118
NA,"with the Democrats, the child-care rebates",118
NA,will not come through for all the people who,118
NA,"are to benefit, but don't blame us because,",119
NA,"after all, it is your fault'.",119
NA,The honourable member for Moncrieff used,119
NA,the example of what was done in the Senate,119
NA,this day with respect to the social security,119
NA,veterans legislation. She tried to say that that,119
NA,was a very good example. It was a good,119
NA,example of the Opposition trying to block the,119
NA,"social justice agenda of this··Government,",119
NA,which has brought in very important measures,119
NA,to aid social security and veterans beneficiar- sions.,119
NA,ies. What happened? The Opposition brought,119
NA,in something that was the reverse of some-,119
NA,thing that had already been passed by this,119
NA,Parliament and tried to add it to the Bill.,119
NA,"Mrs Sullivan- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise",119
NA,a point of order. I have listened very carefully,119
NA,to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister,119
NA,"for Health, who I assume will take his seat",119
NA,now that I have the call. I will not take,119
NA,"exception to the earlier stages of his remarks,",119
NA,but I draw your attention to the standing order,119
NA,"which says that, a question having been",119
NA,"disposed of, it cannot be raised again. I did",119
NA,not canvass the ins and outs of the amend-,119
NA,ments. I did not mention the content of the,119
NA,Bill that I referred to or the amendment. The,119
NA,Parliamentary Secretary is now making,119
NA,statements about the Government's program,119
NA,of social justice and so on. He is starting to,119
NA,go into detail on a matter that has been,119
NA,"dispatched by this House, and that is out of",119
NA,order. We cannot re-canvass a debate which,119
NA,has taken place today and which has been,119
NA,finalised.,119
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Newell)-,119
NA,"There is no point of order. However, I remind",119
NA,the Parliamentary Secretary to confine his,119
NA,remarks to what has been said in the debate,119
NA,so far.,119
Dr THEOPHANOUS,The honourable,119
NA,member for Moncrieff raised this issue in her,119
NA,comments.,119
NA,Mrs Sullivan-Not in the way you are.,119
Dr THEOPHANOUS,She raised the,119
NA,"issue, but she does not think I am entitled to",119
NA,reply to her. That is the whole point of a,119
NA,reply to a speech in the second reading,119
NA,debate. I think I have made my point on that,119
NA,matter.,119
NA,"I will now turn to the other matter, which",119
NA,concerns the possibility that some excuse may,119
NA,"be found by the Opposition and, as the hon-",119
NA,"ourable member for Moncrieff hopes, the",119
NA,"and Democrats, to block this very important and",119
NA,historic legislation. What was the excuse that,119
NA,the honourable member for Moncrieff raised?,119
NA,She raised a concern about the tax file num-,119
NA,ber and the question of whether this legisla-,119
NA,tion is in breach of various privacy provi-,119
NA,Notwithstanding the various guarantees by,119
NA,the Minister for Family Services (Senator,119
NA,Crowley) that the Privacy Commissioner has,119
NA,been and will be involved in the development,119
NA,"and consideration of the system, what do we",119
NA,have? We have the honourable member for,119
NA,Moncrieff telling us that the Government is,119
NA,finnly committed to one particular interpreta-,119
NA,tion of the involvement of the tax file num-,119
NA,ber-her interpretation and the Liberal Party's,119
NA,"interpretation-and that, therefore, the legisla-",119
NA,tion may be blocked because of this. She said,119
NA,this without even accepting the offer of the,119
NA,Minister that this matter be discussed with the,119
NA,Privacy Commissioner and that all privacy,119
NA,concerns be addressed in this process.,119
NA,What did the honourable member for,119
NA,Moncrieff then do? She came up with some,119
NA,half-baked idea that there is some very simple,119
NA,way out of this which the Govenunent could,119
NA,have adopted to overcome any question of the,119
NA,tax file number. But she has not thought,119
NA,through the ramifications of the proposal that,119
NA,she put forward. She simply put it forward as,119
NA,though it were some gospel to which we,119
NA,would readily agree.,119
NA,If the honourable member for Moncrieff or,119
NA,the Opposition has a serious proposal to put,119
NA,"forward, let them put it forward in detail and",119
NA,"I am sure that the Government will look at it,",119
NA,as will the Privacy Commissioner. The reality,119
NA,is that the Opposition is again flagging the,119
NA,fact that it will try to undermine the,119
NA,Government's social justice policies as it did,119
NA,today in respect of the social security and,119
NA,veterans legislation. It will try to find any,119
NA,excuse in order to block important social,119
NA,justice measures.,119
NA,We will not be deflected by these sorts of,119
NA,comments. If the Opposition has concerns,119
NA,about the tax file number and the Privacy,120
NA,"Commissioner is prepared to take them up,",120
NA,"we will consider them, look at them in great",120
NA,detail and come to an accommodation of,120
NA,those concerns. But let us not use these sorts,120
NA,of concerns as some kind of red herring or an,120
NA,excuse to block an important piece of legisla-,120
NA,tion benefiting millions of Australians.,120

Mrs SULLIVAN ,Moncrieff) (10.56,120
NA,p.m.)-I rise reluctantly because I do not,120
NA,want to draw out the proceedings of the,120
NA,House until an unearthly hour tonight. But I,120
NA,want to set right the record on some of the,120
NA,matters raised by the Parliamentary Secretary,120
NA,to the Minister for Health (Dr Theophanous),120
NA,in his reply on the second reading and specifi-,120
NA,cally some of the things he claimed that I said,120
NA,and some of the things that he claimed the,120
NA,Minister for Family Services (Senator,120
NA,Crowley) said.,120
NA,The Minister said that I said that this was,120
NA,only a small step. I do not recall saying,120
NA,anything of the sort. I said it was of only,120
NA,limited significance in the child-care debate,120
NA,because the Child Care Act will be amended,120
NA,in due course when we will have a full debate,120
NA,"on that, and I will enjoy joining in and saying",120
NA,how good it is. I said a little bit in relation,120
NA,that earlier when I said it was about time the,120
NA,Government moved along this track; but there,120
NA,is no debate about that at the moment. I said,120
NA,it is not a significant part of the debate.,120
NA,The Minister was absolutely wrong when he,120
NA,went on to say that it is very significant,120
NA,because it will provide for discussion in the,120
NA,public arena of the proposal and some sort of,120
NA,public input to the proposal's implementation.,120
NA,There has been no policy announcement or,120
NA,intention of the Government to involve the,120
NA,public in this at all. The Health Insurance,120
NA,Commission Amendment Bill simply gives,120
NA,the Health Insurance Commission $2 112,120
NA,"million, which is the money it needs to go",120
NA,into the details of the proposal and put it,120
NA,forward so that when the Child Care Act is,120
NA,amended an administrative structure will be,120
NA,in place. But there is no proposal for public,120
NA,consultation or discussion on that.,120
NA,"I reiterate, contrary to what the Parliamen-",120
NA,"tary Secretary said in his speech, that this is",120
NA,both the keeping of a promise and the break-,120
NA,ing of a promise. It is the keeping of a prom-,120
NA,ise in relation to child care-moving towards,120
NA,that-and it is the breaking of a promise in,120
NA,regard to the use of the tax file number. That,120
NA,was quite specific during the election cam-,120
NA,paign:,120
NA,The Minister then went on to say that the,120
NA,Opposition would find some excuse to oppose,120
NA,this historic measure. We do not oppose the,120
NA,child-care rebate at all; it was our policy too,120
NA,during the election campaign. Our method of,120
NA,"implementation was different, but I have said",120
NA,we will oppose the extension of the tax file,120
NA,number and we have said that in the Senate.,120
NA,It is very clear that the Parliamentary Secre-,120
NA,tary had not looked at the Hansard of the,120
NA,Senate debate because he invented statements,120
NA,by the Minister in the Senate debate and so,120
NA,on that simply are not there. I said at one,120
NA,"stage of the debate, 'What page of the Hans-",120
NA,ard is that?'. He was making it up as he went,120
NA,along. I reiterate it because I will not have,120
NA,myself or the Opposition misrepresented on,120
NA,this.,120
NA,I said the Opposition has said it will oppose,120
NA,the extension of the tax file number. I also,120
NA,relayed to the House something the Parlia-,120
NA,to mentary Secretary should have known-that,120
NA,"Senator Lees, speaking for the Australian",120
NA,"Democrats in this debate, also said, in words",120
NA,"of one syllable, that the Democrats will not",120
NA,support the extension of the use of the tax file,120
NA,number in this way.,120
NA,Senator Lees spoke very strongly for the,120
NA,"proposal of child-care rebates, as did Senator",120
NA,"Newman, and as would I if that was what the",120
NA,"debate was about tonight, but it is not. So",120
NA,there is no contest on child-care rebates. The,120
NA,contest is on the Government attempting to,120
NA,use an issue which has total support as a,120
NA,device to do something that clearly the com-,120
NA,munity a long time ago said it did not want,120
NA,and that the Prime Minister ( Mr Keating) five,121
NA,years ago said in this place would not happen.,121
NA,Keeping the Government honest is what the,121
NA,"Opposition was on about. I am sorry, but the",121
NA,Parliamentary Secretary's representation was,121
NA,exactly what I said would happen-dishonest,121
NA,representation of the Opposition's point of,121
NA,view on child care. It had nothing to do with,121
NA,child care.,121
NA,As far as the Opposition putting forward its,121
NA,"alternatives is concerned, it has. It put forward",121
NA,an alternative method of implementation,121
NA,during the election campaign and also in the,121
NA,Senate. What we are objecting to is the words,121
NA,"of the Minister, Senator Crowley, in the",121
NA,Senate-it is all in the Hansard from page,121
NA,688 onwards for those who want to read it-,121
NA,that this is a simple little Bill that really,121
NA,"not do anything. At one stage, Senator",121
NA,Crowley said that we really ought to be,121
NA,talking about this Bill when we come back,121
NA,with the amendments to the Child Care Act.,121
NA,"Of course, what she is trying to do is channel",121
NA,the opposition to the extension of the tax file,121
NA,number into phoney opposition to child care.,121
NA,I take advantage of my right to speak on the,121
NA,third reading to set right something that was,121
NA,misrepresented in the second reading debate.,121
Dr THEOPHANOUS ,Calwell-Parlia-,121
NA,mentary Secretary to the Minister for Health),121

NA,attempt by the honourable member for,121

NA,The honourable member for Moncrieff tried,121
NA,to go back on some of the comments she,121
NA,"made earlier, and I ask people to read the",121

Mr OKEEFE ,Burke-Parliamentary,121
NA,Secretary to the Minister for Transport and,121
NA,Communications)-by leave-I thank the,121
NA,Opposition for its indulgence in granting me,121
NA,leave. This is a statement which I intended to,121
NA,make at the time the legislation was passed,121
NA,"earlier this evening, but I got caught up in the",121
NA,"proceedings-a trap for young players, I",121
NA,suppose you could say.,121
NA,What I was intending to do on behalf of the,121
NA,does Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait,121
NA,Islander Affairs ( Mr Tickner) was point out,121
NA,that the Government has reluctantly accepted,121
NA,the amendments to the legislation which were,121
NA,moved by the Opposition and the Australian,121
NA,Democrats in the Senate. The reason for this,121
NA,"is that, in view of the scheduled timetable for",121
NA,"the ATSIC elections, the Government has no",121
NA,practical option but to accept the amendments,121
NA,to allow other necessary changes to the,121
NA,ATSIC Act to proceed in time for the ATSIC,121
NA,elections later this year.,121
NA,The Minister has asked me also to convey,121
NA,his apologies to the House for his inability to,121
NA,be here tonight as he is undertaking a visit to,121
NA,Torres Strait in the company of the shadow,121
NA,Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait,121
NA,Islander Affairs.,121
NA,The Minister has asked me to place on,121
NA,record his profound and deep regret that the,121
NA,Opposition and Australian Democrats have,121
NA,combined together to propose amendments,121
NA,which will deny Aboriginal and Torres Strait,121
NA,Islander people the right to have a totally,121
NA,elected ATSIC board and the right to elect the,121
NA,chairperson of ATSIC. It was a source of,121
NA,"great pride to the Government that, had these",121
NA,"proposals gone forth without amendment,",121
NA,indigenous people in this country would have,121
NA,been able to achieve the social justice,121
NA,milestone of having their affairs conducted by,121
NA,"a totally elected body, in this, the United",121
NA,Nations International Year of the World's,121
NA,Indigenous People.,121
NA,The changes proposed by the Government,122
NA,to ATSIC were directly in line with the,122
NA,recommendations of the Royal Commission,122
NA,into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. I would,122
NA,particularly direct the attention of the House,122
NA,to the royal commission's overview and,122
NA,"recommendations, including the following key",122
NA,points. Paragraph 1.7.22 states:,122
NA,The perception of many Aboriginal people . . . is,122
NA,"that too often policies are propounded, programs",122
NA,put forward . . . in a form which has been largely,122
NA,determined in the bureaucracies ... not by Abo-,122
NA,riginal people. The agenda is being fixed by non-,122
NA,Aboriginal people.,122
NA,Paragraph 1.7.23 states:,122
NA,"In the ultimate, self-determination is basically about",122
NA,people having the right to make decisions concern-,122
NA,"ing their own lives, their own communities, the",122
NA,right to retain their culture and to develop it.,122
NA,Paragraph 1.7.34 states:,122
NA,. . . the whole thrust of this report is directed,122
NA,towards the empowerment of Aboriginal society on,122
NA,"the basis of their deeply held desire, their demon-",122
NA,"strated capacity, their demonstrated right to exer-",122
NA,"cise, according to circumstances, maximum control",122
NA,over their own lives and that of their own commu-,122
NA,nities; that such an empowerment requires that the,122
NA,broader society . . . approaches the relationships,122
NA,with the Aboriginal society on the basis of the,122
NA,principle of self-determination.,122
NA,It should be noted for the record that the,122
NA,totality of the Government's proposals were,122
NA,not in response to proposals put forward by,122
NA,"the Opposition, but were directly in line with",122
NA,"the ideas put forward by indigenous people,",122
NA,"through the section 26 review process, carried",122
NA,out as an essential step in the refonn of the,122
NA,ATSIC Act. The ATSIC' commissioners,122
NA,"debated all the issues and, after careful con-",122
NA,"sideration, recommended a fully elected",122
NA,ATSIC. The Government supported their,122
NA,"position and, regrettably, the Opposition has",122
NA,undermined it.,122
NA,The Government is disappointed that the,122
NA,idea of a totally elected commission and,122
NA,chairperson has been so decisively rebuffed,122
NA,by the Opposition. The Minister has asked me,122
NA,"to record the fact that, while he retains his",122
NA,personal respect for the shadow Minister and,122
NA,"the Leader of the Australian Democrats,",122
NA,"Senator Kernot, and looks forward to continu-",122
NA,ing to strive for cross-party cooperation with,122
NA,"them, he does reject the arguments put for-",122
NA,ward by the Democrats and the Opposition in,122
NA,support of their proposals.,122
NA,The views expressed by the Opposition and,122
NA,the Democrats are in defiance of the central,122
NA,theme underpinning the recommendations of,122
NA,the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths,122
NA,"in Custody, namely, empowerment and self-",122
NA,determination. The Minister has already begun,122
NA,to receive letters of outrage in opposition to,122
NA,the attitude being taken in relation to this,122
NA,matter. To give an idea of the vehemence of,122
NA,"this criticism, he has asked me to refer to the",122
NA,letter forwarded to all members and senators,122
NA,by the Sydney Regional Council of ATSIC,122
NA,"which highlighted that, while the Opposition",122
NA,and the Democrats have been very ready to,122
NA,support the non-election and consequent,122
NA,appointment of two ATSIC commissioners,122
NA,"and the chairperson, 'this provision is con-",122
NA,spicuously absent from our non-Aboriginal,122
NA,"elected rcounterpart in Canberra, the Parlia-",122
NA,"ment of Australia, and reflects the paternalism",122
NA,which our non-Aboriginal minders continue,122
NA,to perpetrate upon our people' .,122
NA,"The Minister, in preparing these remarks for",122
NA,"me to deliver, has deliberately chosen not to",122
NA,use inflammatory and critical language of any,122
NA,kind in expressing his own opposition to the,122
NA,"Opposition's amendments, but believes their",122
NA,advocacy is an extremely sad day for the,122
NA,"Commonwealth Parliament, and believes that",122
NA,history will judge the Democrats and coalition,122
NA,harshly for the stand they have taken on this,122
NA,amendment.,122
NA,It should be noted that the ATSIC legisla-,122
NA,"tion confers very little, if any, substantive",122
NA,powers on the chairperson. The ATSIC genie,122
NA,remains well and truly out of the parliamen-,122
NA,"tary bottle, and nothing constructive whatso-",122
NA,ever is gained for the Parliament in forcing,122
NA,the Minister to continue to appoint commis-,122
NA,sioners and the chairperson. The Minister is,122
NA,"convinced, however, that ATSIC will continue",122
NA,to develop and prosper with cross-party,122
NA,cooperation as a genuine vehicle for self-,122
NA,detennination for indigenous people in this,122
NA,"country and that, within the not too distant",122
NA,"future, both the Opposition and the Democrats",122
NA,will be convinced of the desirability of sup-,122
NA,porting the changes that the Minister proposed,122
NA,in the original draft Bill.,122
NA,Given the text of the remarks that the,123
NA,"Minister wanted recorded, it is obvious that",123
NA,he has a considered and deeply-felt position.,123
NA,I appreciate the Opposition granting me leave,123
NA,to read these remarks into the Hansard.,123

NA,The purpose of the National Health Ame-d­,123

NA,of guidelines by the Privacy· Commissioner,123

NA,scriptions. Over $6 billion annually is spent,123
NA,on these services by the Government. Effi-,123
NA,cient and accurate processing of this huge,123
NA,quantity of information requires the use of,123
NA,large computerised databases.,123
NA,Legislation provides for the privacy. -f all,123
NA,information gathered as part of the administra-,123
NA,tion of these very large and complex pro-,123
NA,grams. Section 135A of the National Health,123
NA,Act 1953 and section 130 of the Health,123
NA,Insurance Act 1973 require officers to observe,123
NA,secrecy in respect of all information obtained,123
NA,in the course of their duties. The Privacy Act,123
NA,"1988 also applies to the collection, storage,",123
NA,use and disclosure of personal information,123
NA,which is obtained in the administration of the,123
NA,Medicare benefits program and the pharma-,123
NA,"ceutical benefits program. In addition, the",123
NA,agencies responsible for administering these,123
NA,programs have agreed to be bound by. the,123
NA,Privacy Commissioner's data matching gmde-,123
NA,lines.,123
NA,Section 135AA of the National Health Act,123
NA,1953 complements this general framework by,123
NA,expressly providing that the Privacy Commis-,123
NA,"sioner shall develop, in consultation with",123
NA,"affected organisations, privacy guidelines",123
NA,relating to information obtained under the,123
NA,programs. This section was enacted in 1991,123
NA,following an amendment moved by the,123
NA,Opposition in the Senate which was accepted,123
NA,by the Government.,123
NA,The Privacy Commissioner's subsequent,123
NA,"consultations on the guidelines, and advice",123
NA,from the Office of General Counsel in the,123
NA,Attorney-General's Department which was,123
NA,"provided to the then Department of Health,",123
NA,"Housing and Community Services, revealed",123
NA,a number of problems relating to the wording,123
NA,"of that section. For example, on one reading",123
NA,"of the current provision, personal identifica-",123
NA,tion information held in the eligibility emol-,123
NA,"ment databases-that is, name, address,",123
NA,Medicare card number and pharmaceutical,123
NA,entitlements number-would need to be,123
NA,deleted and reconstructed each five years,123
NA,thereby necessitating the issue of new eligi-,123
NA,bility cards at considerable public expense for,123
NA,no net benefit. Similar problems may relate to,123
NA,"databases containing the names, addresses and",123
NA,qualifications of all approv- providers of,123
NA,services and goods. A further difficulty rel-tes,123
NA,to uncertainty as to whether the sechon,123
NA,applies only to information received after the,123
NA,commencement date of the Health Legislation,123
NA,(pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Act,123
NA,"1991; that is, 27 June 1991.",123
NA,The various difficulties were identified by,123
NA,the Privacy Commissioner in his rep-rt to,123
NA,Parliament of 28 May 1992. The Pnvacy,123
NA,Commissioner has deferred issuing privacy,123
NA,guidelines under the existing section pending,123
NA,the proposed legislative amendments con-,123
NA,tained in this Bill. The provisions in this,123
NA,Bill have been developed in consultation with,123
NA,the Privacy Commissioner. Officials have also,123
NA,discussed these issues with members of the,123
NA,Opposition and the Australian Democrats.,123
NA,The purpose of this Bill is to clarify section,123
NA,135AA to overcome the problems identified,123
NA,during the consideration of the draft guide-,123
NA,lines. It repeals the existing section -d,123
NA,"substitutes a new section 135AA with, subject",123
NA,"to the differences identified below, the same",124
NA,general structure. The Privacy Commissioner,124
NA,will still be required to issue privacy guide-,124
NA,lines for the management of information,124
NA,stored in computer databases and to conduct,124
NA,consultations with affected organisations. The,124
NA,guidelines will also have to be tabled in the,124
NA,Parliament as a disallowable instrument.,124
NA,To avoid the need to delete and reconstruct,124
NA,eligibility enrolment databases every five,124
NA,"years, the new section 135AA makes it clear",124
NA,that the guidelines to be formulated by the,124
NA,Privacy Commissioner do not extend to,124
NA,information contained in databases maintained,124
NA,for the purpose of identifying persons eligible,124
NA,to receive benefits. For similar reasons infor-,124
NA,mation simply identifying the practitioners,124
NA,and pharmacists who provide goods and,124
NA,services or issue referrals in connection with,124
NA,claims are also excluded.,124
NA,The Bill restricts the scope of the proposed,124
NA,guidelines to databases as it is not practicable,124
NA,to cover information held on paper files-that,124
NA,"is, otherwise the guidelines would require the",124
NA,removal of patient names from general files,124
NA,containing ministerial correspondence. How-,124
NA,"ever, the Bill does require the guidelines",124
NA,issued by the Privacy Commissioner to speci-,124
NA,fy the circumstances in which creating paper,124
NA,copies of information in computer databases,124
NA,is prohibited.,124
NA,"Notwithstanding those exemptions, the",124
NA,disclosure of such information will continue,124
NA,to be regulated by the general secrecy provi-,124
NA,"sions under the National Health Act 1953, the",124
NA,Health Insurance Act 1973 and the Privacy,124
NA,Act 1988. The new section 135AA also,124
NA,specifies that the guidelines will cover infor-,124
NA,mation held by an agency whether or not it,124
NA,was obtained after the commencement of the,124
NA,new section.,124
NA,The new section also specifies the content,124
NA,"of the guidelines. In particular, it requires",124
NA,guidelines to cover the ways in which infor-,124
NA,mation may be stored; the circumstances,124
NA,under which the making of paper copies of,124
NA,the information in the databases is prohibited;,124
NA,the uses to which agencies may put the,124
NA,"information, for example, to process claims,",124
NA,to investigate fraud; and the circumstances in,124
NA,which agencies may disclose information. It,124
NA,also requires that information obtained from,124
NA,claims for medical benefits must be stored in,124
NA,a separate database from information obtained,124
NA,"from claims for pharmaceutical benefits, and",124
NA,prohibits linkage of such information except,124
NA,in the way specified in the guidelines. It also,124
NA,requires the guidelines to make special provi-,124
NA,sions in relation to the storage and retrieval of,124
NA,information that is more than five years old.,124
NA,Any complaint about breach of the guide-,124
NA,lines will be regarded as a complaint under,124
NA,"the Privacy Act 1988, enabling the Privacy",124
NA,Commissioner to exercise the powers avail-,124
NA,"able under that Act. As a transitional measure,",124
NA,consultations on guidelines already conducted,124
NA,by the Privacy Commissioner in 1991-92 will,124
NA,remain effective under the new section to,124
NA,avoid unnecessary duplication of effort.The,124
NA,Bill also provides for a number of consequen-,124
NA,tial amendments to the National Health Act,124
NA,1953 and to the Privacy Act 1988.,124
NA,I commend this Bill to the House and I,124
NA,present the explanatory memorandum to this,124
NA,Bill.,124
NA,Leave granted for debate to continue forth-,124
NA,with.,124
Mrs SULLIVAN ,Moncrieff) (11.18,124
NA,p.m.)-I will be very brief. The National,124
NA,Health Amendment Bill has interesting ori-,124
NA,gins. It is an interesting example of the fact,124
NA,"that at times parliament can, through its",124
NA,"activities, actually affect what happens in this",124
NA,"country. In 1989 Senator Patterson, a Liberal",124
NA,"senator from Victoria, happened to ask some",124
NA,questions in an estimates committee hearing,124
NA,relating to the retention of certain information,124
NA,by the Health Insurance Commission. She,124
NA,found that there was no policy in relation to,124
NA,the privacy or security of records. I just,124
NA,reiterate a couple of the figures that the,124
NA,Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for,124
NA,the Health (Dr Theophanous) just gave to this,124
NA,House in the second reading speech. He said:,124
NA,Under these two programs the Government receives,124
NA,annually claims for approximately 157 million,124
NA,medical services and 94 million pharmaceutical,124
NA,prescriptions. Over $6 billion annually is spent on,124
NA,these services by the Government.,124
NA,He went on to say:,124
NA,Efficient and accurate processing of this huge,125
NA,quantity of information requires the use of,125
NA,computerised databases.,125
NA,The number of services involved gives an,125
NA,indication of the huge amount of personal,125
NA,information that is held in the Health Insur-,125
NA,"ance Commission database, and that is an",125
NA,"annual occurrence. It has been established,",125
NA,certainly through estimates committees with,125
NA,"Health Insurance Commission witnesses, that",125
NA,where there are patterns of types of medical,125
NA,"services-for example, pathology tests-",125
NA,combined with the types of medication pre-,125
NA,"scribed, one can actually identify an",125
NA,"individual's medical condition, whatever it",125
NA,may be. The condition does not need to be,125
NA,specified; it can be put together from the,125
NA,"information. As a result, the .information",125
NA,becomes very personal and is clearly very,125
NA,extensive. We would all have some amount,125
NA,of personal information on that database-,125
NA,information which is not protected by any,125
NA,particular privacy provisions.,125
NA,Since 1989 Senator Patterson has pursued,125
NA,this matter in the Senate and through esti-,125
NA,mates committees with a view to pushing the,125
NA,Government into doing something about,125
NA,protecting the privacy of information on the,125
NA,database. In June 1991 the Government's,125
NA,amendments to the Nationat' Health Act,125
NA,sought to establish a computer link between,125
NA,pharmacists and the Health Insurance Com-,125
NA,mission for the purpose of checking an,125
NA,individual's eligibility for benefits under the,125
NA,pharmaceutical benefits scheme. It was a huge,125
NA,step at the time-pharmacists being forced to,125
NA,link with the Health Insurance Commission by,125
NA,computer so that certain personal matters,125
NA,could be pursued-when there were other,125
NA,"ways of doing it. As a result, matters other",125
NA,than individual benefits could be checked,125
NA,through the system.,125
NA,The amendments required the issuing of,125
NA,guidelines by the Privacy Commissioner for,125
NA,the management of data generated by the,125
NA,Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits pro-,125
NA,gram. The guidelines were designed to ad-,125
NA,dress the issue of privacy which had been,125
NA,raised earlier. A report to the Parliament in,125
NA,December 1991 by the Auditor-General and,125
NA,the Department of Finance found that the,125
NA,expected savings from the computer checking,125
NA,system were significantly overstated. As a,125
NA,"large consequence, the Government decided not to",125
NA,"proceed with the system. However, the re-",125
NA,quirement from the Privacy Commissioner to,125
NA,issue guidelines on Medicare and pharmaceu-,125
NA,tical benefits programs remained.,125
NA,"By way of an aside, we ought to keep that",125
NA,example in front of us. I repeat that the report,125
NA,by the Auditor-General and the Department of,125
NA,Finance found that the expected savings from,125
NA,the computer checking system were signifi-,125
NA,cantly overstated. A proposal which made,125
NA,significant advances in the area of linking,125
NA,"personal information, computer databaSes and",125
NA,service providers with the Health Insurance,125
NA,Commission was a very major administrative,125
NA,step with many implications. Whatever one,125
NA,"thinks about it, and however the Government",125
NA,"felt about it at the time, it had been suggested",125
NA,that there were significant savings to be made,125
NA,and that was the justification for implement-,125
NA,ing the system.,125
NA,The Department of Health did not admit,125
NA,that it was wrong. It took the Auditor-General,125
NA,and the Department of Finance to identify that,125
NA,the department was wrong about the savings,125
NA,to be made. If the report had not been written,125
NA,"and the inquiry not undertaken, and if the",125
NA,"Parliament had agreed to the proposal, then I",125
NA,presume that we would have had this forced,125
NA,linking when the savings simply were not,125
NA,there. We should bear in mind that these,125
NA,claims are made from time to time and that a,125
NA,government acting on them will be taken in,125
NA,"a significant direction-a direction, with all",125
NA,"its implications, in which it might not want to",125
NA,go-having been persuaded by costings based,125
NA,on incorrect information. Very often we are,125
NA,told just that; very often there is a dispute in,125
NA,this place about cost savings and so on. We,125
NA,should always take care when taking such a,125
NA,big step if we are told to do it for money,125
NA,reasons.,125
NA,As the Parliamentary Secretary said on,125
NA,behalf of the Minister for Health (Senator,125
NA,"Richardson), a procedure was adopted under",125
NA,"which certain guidelines were issued, and",125
NA,certain difficulties were encountered with it.,125
NA,The Bill attempts to address those difficulties.,125
NA,"As I understand it, the Privacy Commissioner",125
NA,has foreseen no serious problems with the,125
NA,"Bill, but he has identified two areas that he",126
NA,will be monitoring. The first is in relation,126
NA,"the guidelines, which he recommends should",126
NA,not apply to paper files for the present. He,126
NA,will report to the Parliament if he sees any,126
NA,future difficulty with that provision. The,126
NA,second matter relates to the definition of the,126
NA,"word 'database', and he will also keep an eye",126
NA,on that.,126
NA,"In conclusion, in the past the Government",126
NA,has held personal health information indefi-,126
NA,nitely in a readily identifiable form. Prior,126
NA,the development of the guidelines by the,126
NA,"Privacy Commissioner, the Government' had",126
NA,"no policy on the retention, retrieval and",126
NA,destruction of personalised health information.,126
NA,It is pressure from the coalition which has,126
NA,forced it to address this issue and to take,126
NA,"necessary step through this Bill, which we",126
NA,support.,126
Mr HAVILAND ,Macarthur) (11.25,126
NA,p.m.}-I have pleasure in supporting the,126
NA,National Health Amendment Bill 1993. This,126
NA,Bill seeks to clarify doub- concerning the,126
NA,interpretation of the existing provisions which,126
NA,were identified by the Privacy Commissioner,126
NA,in May 1992. Medicare is the fairest and most,126
NA,equitable health insurance system Australia,126
NA,has ever had. It compares favourably with,126
NA,other health systems throughout the world and,126
NA,is a significant achievement of this Labor,126
NA,Government. The Australian people's confi-,126
NA,dence in Medicare and their concern for its,126
NA,retention were amongst the principal reasons,126
NA,for the Government's success at the recent,126
NA,Federal election.,126
NA,"Similarly, the pharmaceutical benefits",126
NA,scheme has played a significant role in pro-,126
NA,viding Australians with prescribed drugs at,126
NA,"reasonable cost, particularly in relation to",126
NA,pensioners and lower income earners. Like,126
NA,"Medicare, the pharmaceutical benefits scheme",126
NA,is an important component in the provision of,126
NA,a health care scheme based on the principles,126
NA,"of access, equity and social justice. However,",126
NA,both the Medicare benefits scheme and the,126
NA,pharmaceutical benefits scheme by necessity,126
NA,account for a significant amount of Common-,126
NA,wealth budgetary outlays. In the 1991-92,126
NA,"financial year, Medicare benefit payments",126
NA,totalled over $4.5 billion and pharmaceutical,126
NA,to benefits totalled nearly $1.2 billion.,126
NA,Many of those opposite have very different,126
NA,philosophical views to the Government on,126
NA,questions such as Medicare and the,126
NA,Government's role in funding our health,126
NA,system. The Labor Party believes that govern-,126
NA,"ments have a legitimate and, indeed, essential",126
NA,role in providing access to essential services,126
NA,such as health care through Commonwealth,126
NA,"expenditure. However, one principle on which",126
NA,to there should be agreement on both sides of,126
NA,the House is that when there is an improved,126
NA,government program which is provided at,126
NA,"significant cost to taxpayers, such as Medicare",126
NA,"or the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, it is",126
NA,essential that the money is spent in the most,126
NA,the equitable and cost-effective manner possible,126
NA,and that abuse of Commonwealth money is,126
NA,kept to an absolute minimum.,126
NA,The need for privacy legislation is well,126
NA,documented. The intention of the Privacy Act,126
NA,and similar legislation is to protect private,126
NA,individuals against public disclosure of infor-,126
NA,mation relating to them which is of a personal,126
NA,or sensitive nature but which is held on file,126
NA,"by a government agency. Indeed, individual",126
NA,Australians have a right to expect that person-,126
NA,al information in the hands of such authorities,126
NA,"should be subject to confidentiality. However,",126
NA,there is a need to ensure that legitimate,126
NA,privacy principles are balanced against the,126
NA,"public interest, particularly in relation to the",126
NA,possible misuse of public money. This is the,126
NA,essential aim of this amendment-to clarify,126
NA,privacy provisions to ensure that legitimate,126
NA,privacy concerns of individuals are protected,126
NA,"while enabling government agencies, in this",126
NA,"case the Health Insurance Commission, to",126
NA,adequately safeguard against fraud and misuse,126
NA,of taxpayers' money.,126
NA,Measures which rightly protect the individ-,126
NA,ual privacy of innocent citizens must not be,126
NA,allowed to become a vehicle whereby corpo-,126
NA,rate criminals can defraud the Common-,126
NA,"wealth. In my first speech, on 6 May, I",126
NA,referred briefly to the issue of medical fraud,126
NA,"and overservicing by medical practitioners, an",126
NA,area in which I have a background of experi-,126
NA,"ence. In 1982, the then Labor Opposition",126
NA,drew attention to reports that a Department of,126
NA,Health estimate supported by the Australian,127
NA,Medical Association showed the level of,127
NA,abuse of Commonwealth medical benefits,127
NA,through fraud or excessive servicing to be,127
NA,around $100 million a year. This represented,127
NA,approximately seven per cent of total,127
NA,"Commonwealth medical benefit payments,",127
NA,this of course being prior to the introduction,127
NA,of Medicare.,127
NA,This led to a Public Accounts Committee,127
NA,inquiry into medical fraud and overservicing,127
NA,which produced an interim report in Decem-,127
NA,ber 1982. The report was extremely critical of,127
NA,the then Department of Health's administra-,127
NA,tion of the relevant program and made a,127
NA,number of recommendations. This led to a,127
NA,hurried shake-up of senior administration in,127
NA,"the department, the allocation of additional",127
NA,"resources, and the creation of a new surveil-",127
NA,lance and investigation division. This all,127
NA,commenced in the dying days of the Fraser,127
NA,Government and was completed by the in-,127
NA,coming Labor Government.,127
NA,A number of highly trained and skilled staff,127
NA,were employed to utilise a highly sophisticat-,127
NA,"ed computer system. However, the best efforts",127
NA,of these staff were undermined by elements,127
NA,"of the medical establishment, both inside and",127
NA,outside the bureaucracy. This situation intensiinvestigation,127
NA,fied as an increasing number of cases of,127
NA,abuse were being identified by analysis of,127
NA,computer data.,127
NA,The threat of increasing exposure of cases,127
NA,of fraud and overservicing caused resentment,127
NA,and hostility amongst sections of the medical,127
NA,"profession, although it was never suggested",127
NA,by anyone that anything other than a minority,127
NA,of medical practitioners was involved in cases,127
NA,of abuse. The controversy surrounding this,127
NA,issue coincided with the Medicare doctors,127
NA,dispute in New South Wales in 1984 and,127
NA,1985. In 1985 the Government decided to,127
NA,abolish the Department of Health surveillance,127
NA,and investigation program and transferred,127
NA,responsibility for control of medifraud and,127
NA,excessive servicing to the Health Insurance,127
NA,Commission.,127
NA,This was an understandable decision by the,127
NA,Government in light of the department's,127
NA,ultimate failure to come to grips with the,127
NA,problem and to reduce the level of abuse,127
NA,which was still estimated at the time to be,127
NA,around about seven per cent of Medicare,127
NA,"benefits. However, it must be said that the",127
NA,consultant's report which recommended the,127
NA,transfer of the function to the commission was,127
NA,"poorly researched, factually incorrect and",127
NA,extremely unfair in its criticism of some,127
NA,"aspects of the program, and gave a totally",127
NA,misleading impression of the reasons for the,127
NA,"failure of the program. Nevertheless, the",127
NA,transfer of responsibility to the commission,127
NA,was seen as a fresh start by the Government,127
NA,and by the medical profession.,127
NA,The Auditor-General's report No. 17 of,127
NA,"1992-93, which was tabled in December last",127
NA,"year, deals with the Insurance Commission's",127
NA,perfonnance in dealing with medifraud and,127
NA,excessive servicing since 1985. Some of the,127
NA,findings and recommendations of this report,127
NA,give cause for concern. Among its key find-,127
NA,ings the report says:,127
NA,"The perfonnance of the Commission, with the",127
NA,"exception of the last 12 months, shows little",127
NA,improvement over that of the then Department of,127
NA,Health in the early 1980s.,127
NA,The report also says that the commission's,127
NA,legislative powers to combat fraud and exces-,127
NA,sive servicing are deficient in regard to the,127
NA,and prosecution of unethical,127
NA,"medical providers, and that the Medical",127
NA,"Services Committee of Inquiry, the bodies",127
NA,"that deal with cases of excessive servicing,",127
NA,were not operating successfully and should be,127
NA,replaced by tribunals.,127
NA,These are just two of a number of examples,127
NA,which were covered by recommendations of,127
NA,"the Public Accounts Committee in 1982, but",127
NA,"which, as the Auditor-General's report points",127
NA,"out, have not been implemented. Another key",127
NA,finding of the Auditor-General's report is of,127
NA,particular relevance to the Bill before us,127
NA,tonight. The Auditor-General found:,127
NA,The ability to release infonnation for investigation,127
NA,"is important in preventing Medifraud, and the",127
NA,Commission has been reluctant to fully utilise its,127
NA,powers under the Health Insurance Act because of,127
NA,uncertainty about the effect of privacy legislation.,127
NA,A comprehensive policy is needed.,127
NA,This is a clear example of the importance of,127
NA,clarifying the distinction between privacy,127
NA,provisions in legislation and the need for,127
NA,access to infonnation in the public interest in,127
NA,order to prevent or detect fraud or misuse of,128
NA,Commonwealth funds. Even though the report,128
NA,"in question refers to the Health Insurance Act,",128
NA,the same principle applies to the National,128
NA,Health Act which this Bill seeks to amend.,128
NA,I would like to take this argument a bit,128
NA,further in relation to the provision of informa-,128
NA,tion between government agencies. I am,128
NA,aware of at least one case in recent years,128
NA,where the Australian Taxation Office was,128
NA,seeking to prosecute a medical practitioner for,128
NA,failure to declare taxable income. The Tax,128
NA,Office sought information from the Health,128
NA,Insurance Commission in relation to the,128
NA,doctor's earnings from Medicare benefits.,128
NA,"However, I understand that the commission",128
NA,refused to supply the information because of,128
NA,concerns over breaches of the secrecy provi-,128
NA,sion of the Health Insurance Act.,128
NA,The point is that the intent of any privacy,128
NA,based provision-whether in a privacy Act or,128
NA,in any other legislation-is surely to protect,128
NA,the privacy of individuals against public,128
NA,disclosure of personal information. I stress,128
NA,words 'public disclosure'. In this case we,128
NA,could reasonably assume that this would mean,128
NA,that names of individual patients of the doctor,128
NA,"in question, and details of their medical",128
NA,"conditions or medical procedures undertaken,",128
NA,would quite properly remain confidential.,128
NA,"However, in this case the only information",128
NA,that the Tax Office had been seeking from the,128
NA,commission was the total Medicare benefits,128
NA,paid to the doctor in question in a given,128
NA,period. No patient details were sought; nor,128
NA,"were they required, yet the information",128
NA,requested could not be supplied by the com-,128
NA,mission because of the secrecy provisions.,128
NA,This further emphasises the need for compre-,128
NA,hensive guidelines that strike the appropriate,128
NA,balance between the need for individual,128
NA,privacy and the need for government agencies,128
NA,to have access to necessary evidence in,128
NA,relation to the prevention or detection of,128
NA,"abuse of government funds, or recovery of",128
NA,"such funds, which is clearly in the public",128
NA,interest. This Bill is an appropriate and timely,128
NA,step in this direction.,128
NA,The Auditor-General's report made a,128
NA,number of other observations in relation to,128
NA,medifraud and excessive servicing which I,128
NA,would like to mention briefly. It points out,128
NA,that many of the problems which existed,128
NA,within the Department of Health's program in,128
NA,the early 1980s and which were referred to in,128
NA,various reports of the Public Accounts Com-,128
NA,mittee still appeared to exist and were only,128
NA,just beginning to be addressed by the Health,128
NA,Insurance Commission.,128
NA,"Further, the report suggests that the previ-",128
NA,ous estimate of seven per cent of the,128
NA,Medicare benefit as the level of abuse could,128
NA,still be appropriate today. Given the current,128
NA,annual Medicare benefit payout of $4.5,128
NA,"billion, this means that the amount of money",128
NA,lost on abuse of Medicare could be in excess,128
NA,"of $300 million a year. In this respect, I am",128
NA,encouraged by the recent announcement by,128
NA,the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson),128
NA,that he will seek the cooperation of the AMA,128
NA,in attempting to crack down on fraud and,128
NA,excessive servicing.·,128
NA,It is acknowledged that only a minority of,128
NA,medical practitioners abuse the system. It is,128
NA,the .clearly in the interests of the responsible,128
NA,members of the profession to work with the,128
NA,"Government to reduce the level of abuse,",128
NA,thereby enabling Medicare funds to be spent,128
NA,more appropriately on improving our health,128
NA,system.,128
NA,"As the Auditor-General's report says, the",128
NA,pressures on the Medicare budget are con-,128
NA,"siderable, with the advent of new medical",128
NA,procedures and the growth of entrepreneurial,128
NA,medicine. The emergence of organised fraud,128
NA,"and excessive servicing, protected by corpo-",128
NA,"rate veils and the best advice money can buy,",128
NA,"as the report says, represents a real challenge",128
NA,to the efficient and effective use of the health,128
NA,"budget. Clearly, there will be a great responsi-",128
NA,bility on the commission and the medical,128
NA,profession to meet this challenge. The Bill,128
NA,before us represents a small but significant,128
NA,measure in this context. I commend the Bill,128
NA,to the House.,128
Mr REID ,Bendigo) (11.36 p.m.)-I rise to,128
NA,support the remarks made by my colleague,128
NA,the honourable member for Moncrieff ( Mrs,128
NA,Sullivan) on the National Health Amendment,128
NA,Bill. It is principally through the efforts of the,128
NA,coalition since 1989 that this Bill is currently,128
NA,before the House. I refer to the efforts of a,128
NA,number of senators in another place-Senators,129
NA,"Walters, Patterson and Watson-who have",129
NA,been pursuing this issue for some four years.,129
NA,I also pay tribute to a former member of this,129
NA,"House, Dr Bob Woods, the former member",129
NA,"for Lowe, who was also very active with",129
NA,regard to this issue.,129
NA,Mr Bruce Scott-A great shadow Minister,129
NA,too.,129
NA,i,129
Mr REID,That is quite right. He was a,129
NA,very fine shadow Minister. He was a great,129
NA,loss to this House and the public of Australia.,129
NA,Since 1989 the coalition has been pursuing,129
NA,the Government on the issue of retention,129
NA,retrieval and destruction of personalised,129
NA,information held by the then Department of,129
NA,"Health, Housing and Community Services and",129
NA,the Health Insurance Commission.,129
NA,"In June 1991, the government amendments",129
NA,to the National Health Act sought to establish,129
NA,a computer link between pharmacists and the,129
NA,"Health Insurance Commission, and that",129
NA,certainly caused quite a lot of consternation,129
NA,amongst the pharmacists in my electorate. The,129
NA,purpose of that computer link was to check an,129
NA,individual's' eligibility for benefits under,129
NA,pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The amend-,129
NA,ments also required the issuing of guidelines,129
NA,by the Privacy Commissioner for the manage-,129
NA,ment of data generated by the Medicare and,129
NA,pharmaceutical benefits programs. These,129
NA,guidelines were to address the issues of,129
NA,privacy which had been raised by Senators,129
NA,"Walters, Patterson and Watson.",129
NA,A report to the Parliament in December,129
NA,1991 by the Auditor-General and the Depart-,129
NA,me-t of Finance found that the expected,129
NA,savmgs from the computer checking system,129
NA,were significantly overstated. As a conse-,129
NA,"quence, the Government' decided not to",129
NA,"pr-ceed with the system. However, the re-",129
NA,qurrement for the Privacy Commissioner to,129
NA,issue guidelines on the Medicare and pharma-,129
NA,ceutical benefits programs remained. Draft,129
NA,guidelines were prepared by the Privacy,129
NA,Commissioner for tabling by April 1992.,129
NA,"However, after advice from the office of",129
NA,"general council, he instead made a report to",129
NA,"the Parliament in May 1992, indicating that",129
NA,he could not table the guidelines since they,129
NA,appeared to be inconsistent with certain,129
NA,provisions of the National Health Act. This,129
NA,Bill now addresses those provisions.,129
NA,I want to refer to the efforts of Senator,129
NA,Patterson in pursuing this issue through,129
NA,Estimates Committee C where Senator Patter-,129
NA,son expressed her concern by asking the,129
NA,officers of the department whether it would be,129
NA,feasible to identify families with genetic,129
NA,"disorders such as fibrocystic disease from,",129
NA,"firstly, the type of doctor they visit, secondly,",129
NA,"th- type of treatment that they receive and,",129
NA,"thirdly, the types of drugs they are prescribed.",129
NA,The answer Senator Patterson was given at,129
NA,Estimates Committee C was that it would be,129
NA,possible in fact to identify these people. That,129
NA,is something about which the community,129
NA,ought to be very concerned. That led Senator,129
NA,Patterson to push for a period of four years,129
NA,for the department to develop a much better,129
NA,privacy policy in relation to Medicare data.,129
NA,This legislation goes only part of the way,129
NA,to allaying the fears expressed by Senator,129
NA,"Patterson, Senator Walters and Senator Wat-",129
NA,son. They believe that that legislation should,129
NA,"go further than it does, but at least it is",129
NA,the placing something into position where it can,129
NA,be watched and developed. I know that the,129
NA,senators on the coalition side who have been,129
NA,active in the implementation of this legislation,129
NA,.,129
NA,"take great credit, which is due to them for the",129
NA,very Important role that they played in ' mak-,129
NA,ing sure that the Government in fact ad-,129
NA,dressed these questions which were raised in,129
NA,another place.,129
NA,I believe that the legislation currently before,129
NA,us goes part of the way but I am sure that it,129
NA,will be watched very closely by the coalition.,129
NA,Most of the credit should go to the coalition,129
NA,parties for bringing the Government to the,129
NA,implementation of this legislation. I can,129
NA,assure honourable members that the coalition,129
NA,will be watching the progress and the imple-,129
NA,mentation of this legislation to ensure that its,129
NA,fears and concerns in respect of it are fully,129
NA,and properly met by the Government.,129
Dr THEOPHANOUS ,CalweU-,129
NA,Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for,129
NA,Health) (11.43 p.m.)-in reply-:-I want to,129
NA,thank the honourable member for Macarthur,129
NA,( Mr Haviland) for his very thoughtful contri-,129
NA,bution-,129

NA,us too.,130
Dr THEOPHANOUS,And also the,130
NA,"Opposition, especially the honourable member",130
NA,for Moncrieff who keeps interrupting me. The,130
NA,Government appreciates the Opposition's,130
NA,support for this legislation. I want to point out,130
NA,"to the honourable member for Macarthur, on",130
NA,the question about the importance of there,130
NA,being some provisions which allow for the,130
NA,checking of medical fraud and certain issues,130
NA,"of overservicing, that in fact the Privacy",130
NA,Commissioner accepted this as one of the,130
NA,legitimate concerns of the department in his,130
NA,report. In his report he refers to certain,130
NA,aspects of the operations· of the department,130
NA,and cited examples of where the department,130
NA,was required to re-identify patient data. These,130
NA,included:,130
NA,to support the work of a Royal Commission,130
NA,to support the work of a Parliamentary inquiry,130
NA,to assist in a murder trial or coronial inquiry,130
NA,to assist in medical board and medical complaint,130
NA,tribunal hearings,130
NA,to respond to requests by a patient,130
NA,if a matter previously under the control of the,130
NA,HlC were to be the subject of further inquiry by,130
NA,the HIC (fraud investigation),130
NA,to support epidemiological studies where it,130
NA,possible to trace service utilisation over time,130
NA,involving the same patient using an identification,130
NA,number (because of different identification,130
NA,numbering schemes in different health schemes),130
NA,to enable epidemiological studies where the,130
NA,studies involve medical service utilisation and,130
NA,drug service utilisation and a common identifier,130
NA,is not present in both systems.,130
NA,to enable tracking of individuals who may have,130
NA,"taken a drug for which a new, lon:g term, serious",130
NA,side effect emerges.,130
NA,(Some of the above uses of identified data only,130
NA,require temporary re-identification of data to enable area.,130
NA,a link to be made between two schemes or data,130
NA,bases and names were not stored permanently.),130
NA,All that information is important in addressing,130
NA,the concerns mentioned by the honourable,130
NA,member for Macarthur. I thank aU honourable,130
NA,members who contributed to the debate. I,130
NA,commend the legislation to the House.,130
NA,Question resolved in the affirmative ..,130

NA,Education Scholarships,130
Mr TUCKEY ,O'Connor) (11.47 p.m.)-,130
NA,"As most honourable members know, I have",130
NA,for many years brought students from senior,130
NA,high schools within my electorate to the,130
NA,national capital on education scholarships.,130
NA,Tonight in the Speaker's gallery I have two,130
NA,young men who are the 33rd and 34th stu-,130
NA,dents to participate in this scholarship. They,130
NA,"are Bradley Cox, aged 17 years; a year 12",130
NA,"student from Merredin Senior High School,",130
NA,who lives 60 kilometres away in the farming,130
NA,community of Doodlakine-the home of,130
NA,Senator Walsh-and travels to school each,130
NA,day. He hopes to continue studying science at,130
NA,university next year. Also present is Regan,130
NA,"Opalinski, aged 15 years, a year 10 student",130
NA,"from Katanning Senior High School, who",130
NA,comes from the farming community of Tam-,130
NA,is not bellup but boards in Katanning. I take this,130
NA,opportunity to -incerely thank Ansett Austral-,130
NA,"ia for its assistance. As is the custom, I have",130
NA,invited both of the students to write a short,130
NA,speech which I now have the pleasure in,130
NA,reading. Bradley writes:,130
NA,Merriden is a relatively large country town-,130
NA,"population 4,300-which is located 260 kilometres",130
NA,"East of Perth, halfway between Perth and Kalgoor-",130
NA,lie along the Great Eastern Highway. It is the,130
NA,centre of the wheatbelt region of Western Australia,130
NA,and is focused on the surrounding wheat and sheep,130
NA,farms which are very important industries to the,130
NA,The district was first settled in the early 1800's by,130
NA,sandalwood cutters and later some of the land was,130
NA,taken up by pastoralists who used it for grazing.,130
NA,The area grew and eventually became a large,130
NA,"agricultural area, as the development of the railway",130
NA,and discovery of gold at Coolgardie brought more,130
NA,people.,130
NA,Today the town is very important as the main tov.:n,130
NA,"in the shire, and many people travel to Merredm",130
NA,"for shopping, school and medical needs.",130
NA,It has many. facilities such as an agricultural,131
NA,"research station, its own newspaper and many",131
NA,sporting and cultural clubs.,131
NA,One of the most noticeable features of Merredin is,131
NA,"its beautiful trees and rose bushes, which adorn the",131
NA,town in a fairly hot climate.,131
NA,"The education facilities of the town are very good,",131
NA,including three primary schools and the senior high,131
NA,school which I attend.,131
NA,The senior high school has 367 students which,131
NA,come from the surrounding region.,131
NA,This small school has both advantages and disad-,131
NA,vantages. The small population allows a friendlier,131
NA,atmosphere but there are also less facilities for,131
NA,study.,131
NA,"Similarly, the town of Merredin is a friendly,",131
NA,peaceful place but is isolated from the city.,131
NA,A major concern for all people in the country areas,131
NA,is the declining population which means that shops,131
NA,and facilities are slowly disappearing. This process,131
NA,leads to diminishing employment in country areas.,131
NA,Roads and transport costs are also important,131
NA,"because of the distances involved. However, the",131
NA,pioneering spirit which enabled people to overcome,131
NA,the hardships of isolation and distance and to create,131
NA,"the town, will ensure the survival of the area.",131
NA,"The rural people love the space, peace and friendli-",131
NA,"ness of the district, compared to the rush, noise,",131
NA,"overcrowding, crime and pollution of the cities.",131
NA,Regan Opalinski writes:,131

NA,Region's population represents 2.9 per cent of,131
NA,WA's population and 10.3 per cent of the rural,131
NA,"population. Between the last two censuses, Katan-",131
NA,ning was one of the few shires to increase in,131
NA,"population, gaining 6.2 per cent higher than the",131
NA,average ..,131
NA,"Katanning has a large exporting abattoir, creating",131
NA,"job opportunities for around 340 people, which",131
NA,benefits the district. Katanning has the largest,131
NA,saleyards in WA outside Perth. Katanning also has,131
NA,very large grain storage bins. Local crops are,131
NA,"wheat, barley, lupins and oats; and wool, sheep,",131
NA,cattle and pigs are the main animal products.,131
NA,Katanning's climate consists of warm dry summers,131
NA,and cool wet winters and is ideally suited to crop,131
NA,and livestock farming.,131
NA,"Katanning has a senior high school, which I attend,",131
NA,providing secondary education for 550 students,131
NA,from all over the region. The high school is very,131
NA,competitive and has a reputation for excellence,131
NA,"both academically and in sport, where it is very",131
NA,well known for its athletic performance. It com-,131
NA,petes in many sporting events such as the high,131
NA,"schools country week carnival in Perth, summer",131
NA,cup in Albany and numerous other athletics and,131
NA,swimming carnivals.,131
NA,"There is a residential hostel, St Andrews College,",131
NA,"located close to the school, catering for those who",131
NA,live in the outlying regions. Katanning boasts a,131
NA,"good range of sporting facilities, including golf",131
NA,"courses, lawn bowls, tennis, swimming pools and",131
NA,sporting ovals and soon an indoor recreation centre.,131
NA,It is a community built on solid foundations and is,131
NA,going ahead despite the difficult times in rural,131
NA,areas.,131
NA,I thank the Speaker and the officers concerned,131
NA,for making it possible for a group of young,131
NA,people to attend the Governor-General's,131
NA,"Address-in-Reply, particularly the Serjeant-at-",131
NA,Arms for giving them a good look at the,131
NA,mace and telling them its history. It was,131
NA,extremely interesting.,131

Mr RONALDSON ,Ballarat) (11.52,131
NA,"p.m.)-Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. May",131
NA,I take this opportunity-the first I have had-,131
NA,to officially congratulate you on your eleva-,131
NA,tion to that role. Tonight I wish to speak,131
NA,about an issue that affects all Australians-,131
NA,that of youth homelessness. Although this,131
NA,issue has received prominence only in recent,131
NA,"years, the many organisations throughout",131
NA,Australia which have been dealing specifically,131
NA,with this national tragedy will attest to the,131
NA,fact that it is not a new one.,131
NA,As far as the wider Australian community,131
NA,"is concerned, however, it was the publication",131
NA,of the Burdekin report in early 1989 that,131
NA,raised public awareness of the extent and,131
NA,seriousness of youth homelessness because of,131
NA,the extensive media attention it received. The,131
NA,Burdekin report gave estimates of youth,131
NA,sheep homelessness which sent a shudder through,131
NA,the community. It claimed that between,131
NA,"20,000 and 25,000 Australians under the age",131
NA,of 18 were homeless. What was even more,131
NA,shocking was the likely estimate that between,131
NA,"50,000 and 70,000 young people were either",131
NA,homeless or at serious risk. I suspect that for,131
NA,want of a better description these young,131
NA,people were tagged with the name 'street,131
NA,kids'. The push to address their plight has,132
NA,helped raise awareness of other youth related,132
NA,issues such as drug abuse and youth suicide.,132
NA,There are now a large number of organisa-,132
NA,tions throughout the country that are specifi-,132
NA,"cally targeting assistance to street kids, and",132
NA,fortunately this is becoming more and more,132
NA,hands-on. There has been criticism in the past,132
NA,that philosophical debates about the cause of,132
NA,the problem were taking precedence over,132
NA,direct hands-on contact with affected street,132
NA,"kids. The great challenge for governments,",132
NA,"both State and Federal, is to ensure that both",132
NA,aspects are adequately funded and appropriate,132
NA,priorities accorded. Following the tabling of,132
NA,"the Burdekin report, an extra $100 million",132
NA,was allocated by the Commonwealth Govern-,132
NA,ment over a four-year period specifically to,132
NA,"tackle youth homelessness. However, there is",132
NA,"still an enormous amount to be done, and",132
NA,appropriate responses need to be both devel-,132
NA,oped and refined.,132
NA,While the methodology used by the Burde-,132
NA,kin inquiry has been questioned in some,132
NA,"quarters, it is my belief that it does the debate",132
NA,no good whatsoever to debate numbers alone.,132
NA,The debate should be centred on appropriate,132
NA,responses at the street level to address the,132
NA,root causes of youth homelessness. It is,132
NA,generally agreed that the primary causes of,132
NA,youth homelessness are family instability and,132
NA,"breakdown, poverty and unemployment. The",132
NA,increase in youth homelessness can be di-,132
NA,rectly equated with the deteriorating position,132
NA,of those three root causes.,132
NA,The serious issues of family instability and,132
NA,"breakdown, poverty and unemployment that",132
NA,affect the wider community can therefore be,132
NA,seen to be exacerbating the problems facing,132
NA,Australia's youth. The need to address the,132
NA,immediate requirements of street kids such as,132
NA,crisis accommodation and long-term housing,132
NA,"is obvious, and so too is the need to address",132
NA,"the issues of job creation, income support and",132
NA,social support.,132
NA,While considerable financial and human,132
NA,resources have been allocated in an endeavour,132
NA,"to address the youth homelessness tragedy, it",132
NA,is glaringly obvious that there has been no,132
NA,"improvement. Indeed, workers in the field are",132
NA,adamant that the situation is deteriorating,132
NA,"even further. On that basis, it is a matter of",132
NA,great urgency for the community to address,132
NA,"the bigger picture agenda, which should",132
NA,include a review of the availability of educa-,132
NA,tion to young people and also the availability,132
NA,of health services and employment opportuni-,132
NA,ties and training.,132
NA,Probably the saddest aspect of youth home-,132
NA,lessness is that in the vast majority of cases,132
NA,homeless young people are in that position,132
NA,through no fault of their own. On that basis,132
NA,the questions of family instability and break-,132
NA,"down, poverty and unemployment must be",132
NA,addressed in the context of being the main,132
NA,"causes of, or at the very least major contribu-",132
NA,"tors to, youth homelessness.",132

Mr ALDRED ,Deakin) (11.55 p.m.)- Mr,132
NA,"Deputy Speaker, I would like to join my",132
NA,colleague in congratulating you on your,132
NA,elevation to the office of Deputy Speaker.,132
NA,In this adjournment debate I wish to draw,132
NA,the attention of the House to the plight of a,132
NA,Victorian citizen and resident of Barbiston,132
NA,"Road, Keilor, Mr Jesse Boyse, otherwise",132
NA,known as 'Snowy' Boyse. To put this matter,132
NA,"into context, Snowy Boyse, who is 73 years",132
NA,"of age, owns one of the properties on",132
NA,Barbiston Road which the Federal Airports,132
NA,"Corporation, the FAC, is attempting to ac-",132
NA,quire in order to extend the runways of,132
NA,Melbourne Airport.,132
NA,"Mr Boyse, in a letter to my colleague the",132
NA,"shadow Minister for tourism and aviation, the",132
NA,"honourable member for Fadden ( Mr Jull),",132
NA,"dated 26 February 1993, explained that some",132
NA,"residents of Barbiston Road have, under",132
NA,"pressure, accepted FAC offers dealing with",132
NA,residents outside the Lands Acquisition Act,132
NA,"1989, the LAA, by agreement under section",132
NA,36 of the Federal Airports Corporation Act,132
NA,"1986, the FACA.",132
NA,Snowy maintains that by offering these,132
NA,terms the FAC is precluding residents from,132
NA,the rights and privileges to which landowners,132
NA,"are entitled under the LAA, including an",132
NA,"equivalent dwelling, stamp duty on the new",132
NA,"property, exemption from capital gains tax,",132
NA,"removal expenses, and access to all legal",132
NA,expenses in the event of differences of opin-,133
NA,ion regarding the transaction. Residents have,133
NA,been asked to get valuations on their proper-,133
NA,ties but Snowy protests that there are no,133
NA,potential buyers because it is a well-known,133
NA,fact that the land is 'condemned' and 'has no,133
NA,sale value'; therefore potential buyers are,133
NA,existent.,133
NA,"Snowy, together with a neighbour, Mr",133
NA,"Graham Tamworth, wrote to the Minister for",133
NA,Transport and Communications (Senator,133
NA,Collins) to organise a time for a petition from,133
NA,"residents to be given to him in Canberra but,",133
NA,through the honourable member for Calwell,133
NA,"(Dr Theophanous), I understand, were in-",133
NA,formed that the Minister refused.,133
NA,"According to Snowy, the FAC has been on",133
NA,his property without permission making bore,133
NA,tests for runways and doing a geological,133
NA,survey; yet the FAC has informed him by,133
NA,letter that it doeS not need his property.,133
NA,Recently Snowy sent a letter to the Minister,133
NA,making a claim for compensation under,133
NA,section 98 of the LAA. The Minister referred,133
NA,him to the FAC and informed him that he did,133
NA,not respond to his claim. Snowy maintains,133
NA,that the Minister should have issued a claim,133
NA,form as required under. the LAA. Instead the,133
NA,FAC has been negotiating settlements by,133
NA,agreement under section 36 of the FACA.,133
NA,"All this becomes rather complicated, but",133
NA,basically Snowy maintains that the Minister,133
NA,has not done his job under sections 97 and 98,133
NA,of the LAA and he has refused to negotiate,133
NA,with the FAC. It appears that Snowy has right,133
NA,on his side. He has been pushed from pillar,133
NA,to post and has recently been informed by the,133
NA,FAC that unless he is prepared to negotiate,133
NA,with it under its terms and conditions it will,133
NA,let him wait there for up to 15 years before it,133
NA,finally uses the LAA to forcibly take his,133
NA,home and lane'. By that time Snowy will be,133
NA,88 years old. Is it any wonder that Snowy,133
NA,regards the FAC as absolutely unscrupulous?,133
NA,NA,133
NA,described as 'a public authority with a private,133
NA,enterprise philosophy'-in 1991-92 made a,133
NA,"profit of $142 million which, after the pay-",133
NA,"ment of interest, et cetera, became a net profit",133
NA,of $35 million. Snowy Boyse describes that,133
NA,organisation as 'private individuals who have,133
NA,been given the jurisdiction over my proper-,133
NA,ty-for profit motives'. He goes on to give an,133
NA,account of the FAC's dealings with a Mr,133
NA,"Robert Shaw of Rosebank farm, Barbiston",133
NA,"Road, Keilor, which are, to say the least, very",133
NA,suspect but tOb.lengthy to deal with here. Mr,133
NA,nonBoyse concludes his letter by saying that all,133
NA,residents should be dealt with on a 'level,133
NA,playing field' as laid down under the LAA.,133
NA,"As the events of 13 March ensued, the",133
NA,shadow Minister was unable to come to,133
NA,Snowy's aid as he had hoped. I therefore wish,133
NA,to draw this matter to the attention of the,133
NA,House and the Minister involved in the hope,133
NA,that Snowy will now receive fairer treatment,133
NA,than he has so far from the FAC.It would,133
NA,appear that on this matter ministerial interven-,133
NA,tion is most definitely required.,133

NA,"renting privately, can earn up to $24 169 per year,",137
NA,before their Family Allowance Supplement (now,137
NA,Additional Family Payment) ceases.,137
NA,(i) There is a difference between the amount a,137
NA,private renter and the amount a homeowner can,137
NA,earn before their Additional Family Payment ceases,137
NA,as the amount earned by the renting family includes,137
NA,rent assistance. Rent assistance is paid to private,137

NA,"if so, how does he reconcile the two positions.",137
NA,(2) Would the political disintegration of Australia,137
NA,follow if a referendum did not eStablish a majority,137
NA,in favour of republican change in all States.,137
NA,(3) How could he deal with problems arising,138
NA,from State constitutional monarchies co-existing in,138
NA,a federation with republican States under a republi-,138
NA,can national structure.,138
NA,(4) Will a referendum be conducted on Australia,138

NA,volved in altering the Constitution to promote,138
NA,"reconciliation; if so, how.",138
NA,(14) Does he intend to change the Constitution,138
NA,to enable one person to hold simultaneously the,138
NA,positions of president and Prime Minister.,138
Mr KEATING ,The answer to the honour-,138
NA,able member's question is as follows:,138
NA,(1)-(14) The honourable member's question,138
NA,appears to be based on a presumption that I have,138
NA,an agenda for change far wider than the one I have,138
NA,stated publicly. That is not so.,138
NA,Republic,138
NA,(Question No. 128),138
NA,"Mr Slipper asked the Prime Minister, upon",138
NA,"notice, on 13 May 1993:",138

Mr KEATING ,The answer to the honour-,138
NA,able member's question is as follows:,138
NA,(1)-(4) I assume the honourable member would,138
NA,not be foolish enough to claim that retainirig the,138
NA,British monarch as Australia's head of state would,138
NA,be likely to have a positive effect on the unemploy-,138
NA,ment problem. Unless that is his purpose I fail to .,138
NA,see the relevance of his question to the issue of,138
NA,"whether Australians should, or should not, vote at",138
NA,a referendum in favour of having as head of state,138
NA,"an Australian, chosen by Australians.",138

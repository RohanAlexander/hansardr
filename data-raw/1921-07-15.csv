Sir JOSEPH COOK , I do not see my,19

NA,that coarse. I t is for each Government,19

NA,"list of these questions? I f not, will he",19
NA,be good enough to obtain the list as soon.,19
NA,as possible.,19
Sir JOSEPH COOK ,M y impression,19
NA,is that a questionnaire of the kind has been,19
NA,"issued, though I am not clear about i t .",19

NA,OLD-AGE PENSIONSAN D,20
NA,MATERNITY ALLOWANCE.,20
NA,"DISQUALIFICATION"" OF ALIENS .",20
Sir JOSEPH COOK ,Yesterday the,20
NA,honorable member for Batman ( Mr.,20
NA,Brennan) asked a question about the dis-,20
NA,qualification of aliens for old-age pensions,20
NA,and maternity allowances. I am now pre-,20
NA,pared with the following reply >->,20
NA,In 1918 the Government decided that per-,20
NA,sons of .'enemy origin who were applying-for,20
NA,maternity allowances or invalid or old-age,20
NA,"heard them pensions should, in addition to fulfilling the",20
NA,"conditions required by law, possess tlie three",20
NA,following qualifications:-,20
NA,(a) Kesidence in Australia for ten years,20
NA,prior to the outbreak' of the war;,20
NA,(6) Pre-war naturalization; -,20
NA,(c) Loyal conduct.,20
NA,The Government - has now given further con-,20
NA,"sideration to this question, and i t has been de-",20
NA,in the case of invalid and old-age pen-,20
NA,"sion, claimants to waive the condition -tha't",20
NA,wheclaimants' naturalization should have been,20
NA,"to the war, and, in addition, to",20
NA,dispense with any residential qualifications,20
NA,other than those already contained in the,20
NA,and Old-age Pensions Act.,20
NA,In the case of claimants for maternity al-,20
NA,"lowances, the requirement of' pre-war naturali-",20
NA,.has been waived; but it will still be,20
NA,necessary for the claimant (or her husband,20
NA,if. he was of enemy 'origin) to have been,20
NA,prior to the birth of the' child in,20
NA,respect of which-the allowance is claimed. The,21
NA,-qualification of ten years' residence prior to,21
NA,the war will no longer be insisted upon.,21
NA,I f will still be necessary for claimants bf,21
NA,-enemy origin to satisfy the authorities as to,21
NA,their loyalty.,21
NA,This decision will take,21

NA,"stand, all .the States have now completed",21

NA,desirous of knowing when payments will,21

Sir JOSEPH COOK, 1 am afraid I ' Government?,21
NA,cannot tell the honorable member - There,21
NA,"is some difficulty, I understand, in regard",21
NA,to the realization of the assets connected follow: -,21
NA,"with the old Pools, and some difficulty",21

Mr LAVELLE , I understand that re-,21

Mr STEWART ,Wimmera) [11.19].,22
NA,- I support the amendment that has been,22
NA,moved by the honora'ble member for the public.,22
NA,"Dampier ( Mr Gregory). This, i t seems",22
NA,"to me, is the vital part of the whole Bill.",22
NA,The Tariff Board is to be appointed to does.,22
NA,prevent Australian manufacturers in pro-,22
NA,"tected industries taking undue advantage ing,",22
NA,of the duties recently passed by this,22
NA,House; and charging unnecessarily high,22
NA,prices for their products. We had last,22
NA,night a very long discussion on the,22
NA,stitutional aspect of this question.,22
NA,seems to me that we can sweep aside the,22
NA,"constitutional question, and achieve",22
NA,object in a very simple way. We should,22
NA,place upon the Australian manufacturers,22
NA,in all protected industries the onus of,22
NA,ing that the goods produced by them are,22
NA,available to the public at reasonable rates.,22
NA,By way of illustration I would refer,22
NA,what has been done by the Australian,22
NA,"Dried Fruits Association, which is",22
NA,"gaged in a protected industry, and has",22
NA,been very successful. The Association,22
NA,fixed the price of its produce for local,22
NA,"consumption, but found, some years ago,",22
NA,that although i t had fixed a reasonable,22
NA,"price to the retailer, the retailer",22
NA,charging exorbitant prices to the public.,22
NA,The matter was discussed at its annual,22
NA,"conference, with the result that it now",22
NA,"fixes, not only the price of its products",22
NA,"the retailer, but tie price at which",22
NA,retailer shall sell to the public.,22
Mr GROOM ,Th e honora'ble member,22
NA,does not suggest that that should,22
NA,bodied in the law.,22
Mr STEWART ,No . The amendwhich,22
NA,ment moved by the honorable member for,22
NA,Dampier covers my suggestion. I t would,22
NA,throw upon the manufacturers in our,22
NA,tected industries the onus of showing,22
NA,their goods were made available to the,22
NA,public at reasonable prices. We need not dustry -,22
NA,"set, out in the clause what steps shall be",22
NA,taken by them to achieve that object.,22
NA,have simply to place upon them the onus,22
NA,"of taking such steps, failing which they",22
NA,may suffer a reduction or abolition,22
NA,the Protective duty enjoyed by them.,22
NA,I f we did that I am convinced that,22
NA,[409],22
NA,they would find means of giving effect to,22
NA,our desire in this direction without any,22
NA,after legal pressure being brought to bear upon,22
NA,r them. This sort of thing is done every-,22
NA,"day. That international enterprise, the",22
NA,"Ford Motor Company, for instance, fixes",22
NA,"the price to the retailer, and also the",22
NA,price at which the retailer shall sell to,22
Mr MARR ,I t does not.,22
Mr HILL , I n very many instances it,22
NA,Several honorable members interject-,22
Mr STEWART , I have evidently,22
NA,stirred up a hornet's nest by what was,22
NA,quite an innocent remark. I shall with-,22
NA,condraw my reference to the Ford Motor,22
NA,"I t Company, and say merely that the pro-",22
NA,cedure outlined by me.is frequently fol-,22
NA,our lowed -By throwing this responsibility,22
NA,upon manufacturers in protected indus-,22
NA,"tries I believe we may, in some measure,",22
NA,seebe protected from the rapacity and greed,22
NA,of those who show a tendency to take un-,22
NA,due advantage of high duties. The con-,22
NA,to tention of honorable members of the,22
NA,Country party in the course of the recent,22
NA,enTariff debate was that the high duties,22
NA,imposed on many commodities had opened,22
NA,"the door to commercial dishonesty, and",22
NA,proof of the soundness of that contention,22
NA,is afforded by the introduction of this,22
NA,"Bill. The Tariff schedule, however, has",22
NA,"was been passed by the House, and as Demo-",22
NA,crats we are prepared to abide by the de-,22
NA,cision of the majority. There is still one,22
NA,ray of hope left to us with the creation,22
NA,"to of this Board, provided that it is required",22
NA,the to do what the. honorable member for,22
NA,Dampier proposes.,22
Mr MCGRATH ,Wha t penalty would,22
NA,be emthe honorable member prescribe?,22
Mr STEWART ,Th e penalty for,22
NA,the clause already provides-th e re-,22
NA,"duction, or total withdrawal of the duty.",22
Mr MCGRATH ,Woul d not that be,22
NA,provery hard on those who were doing the,22
NA,that fair thing? Why should they be ruined,22
NA,"for the sake of one ""crook"" i n an in-",22
Mr STEWART ,I f complaint were,22
NA,We made that' the products of a certain pro-,22
NA,tected industry were being retailed at an,22
NA,"exorbitant rate, then under our proposal",22
NA,"of the Tariff Board would hold an inquiry,",22
NA,' and the. evidence of the manufacturers,22
NA,concerned would be taken. They would,22
NA,"produce tlieir invoices, proving, let us",23
NA,that they were selling to the retailer at a,23
NA,"reasonable rate, but under our amendment",23
NA,something more would be required of,23
NA,"them. Tbey would have to show, not",23
NA,merely that they were selling their goods,23
NA,"at a reasonable rate to the retailers, but,",23
NA,"if they desired to retain the existing duty,",23
NA,that these goods were reaching the con-,23
NA,sumer through channels that would not,23
NA,profiteer.,23
Mr MCGRATH ,Tak e the case of an,23
NA,industry in which only two firms were,23
NA,engaged. I f one sold to the consumer at,23
NA,"a reasonable rate, would the honorable",23
NA,member withdraw the protective duty,23
NA,from him because the other manufacturer,23
NA,was charging exorbitant prices ?,23
Mr STEWART ,"Obviously , i f there",23
NA,were only two firms engaged in a pro-,23
NA,"tected industry, tbe firm that was charg-'",23
NA,ing an exorbitant price would do no busi-,23
NA,"ness, so"" that what the honorable member",23
NA,suggests is not likely to arise.,23
Mr MASSYGREENE , I think it must follow,23
NA,that unless there is a combination one,23
NA,cannot charge excessive prices as against,23
NA,the other.,23
Mr STEWART ,"Yes , they must all",23
NA,bo in the same boat. The amendment,23
NA,moved by tlie honorable member for Dam-,23
NA,pier on behalf of the Country party will,23
NA,meet the situation. I t was argued last,23
NA,night that we had not the constitutional,23
NA,power to do what we are aiming at. I f,23
NA,"that is so, then the honorable member for",23
NA,Grampians ( Mr Jowett) and the honor-,23
NA,able member for Bourke ( Mr Anstey),23
NA,were right when they said that the waste-,23
NA,paper basket was the proper place for this,23
NA,Bill. I f the clause is amended as pro-,23
NA,posed hy us i t should do some good.,23
Mr RYAN ,Th e honorable member,23
NA,and his party believe that legal provision,23
NA,should be made whereby consumers will,23
NA,obtain their commodities at reasonable,23
NA,rates ?,23
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Tha t is quite another,23
NA,thing-tha t is price-fixing straight out.,23
Mr JOWETT ,W e believe that the,23
NA,effect of the amendment will be to secure,23
NA,that the consiuner shall get his commo-,23
NA,dities at a reasonable rate.,23
Mr STEWART ,Th e amendment,23
NA,sets out that any complaint that the con-,23
NA,sumer is being charged unfair prices for,23
NA,protected articles shall be inquired into.,23
NA,Surely that is plain enough. I advocate,23
NA,"say, the principle that we should place upon",23
NA,"Australian manufacturers, i n return for",23
NA,"protecting them from outside competition,",23
NA,the onus of showing that the goods pro-,23
NA,duced by them under protective duties are,23
NA,available to the public at reasonable rates.,23
NA,I hope that the amendment will be,23
NA,carried.,23
Mr RYAN ,West Sydney) [11.28] - ',23
NA,The extraordinary attitude taken up by,23
NA,honorable members of the Country party,23
NA,"on this amendment brings me to my feet,",23
NA,because they lay down certain proposi-,23
NA,"tions which, so far as I have been able to",23
NA,"gauge their actions i n this House, they",23
NA,honour more in the breach than the ob-,23
NA,servance. They lay down the proposition,23
NA,that consumers must get their commo-,23
NA,"dities at reasonable rates, and tbat there",23
NA,should be legal provision to that effect.,23
Mr GREGORY ,Nothing ' of the sort.,23
NA,Our amendment simply gives scope for,23
NA,inquiry.,23
Mr RYAN ,The n does not the hon-,23
NA,orable member contend that consumers,23
NA,"should get things at reasonable rates, and",23
NA,that legal provision should be made to,23
NA,secure that?,23
Mr GREGORY ,W e are not discussing,23
NA,that phase of the question.,23
Mr RYAN ,Th e honorable member,23
NA,either does or does not contend that the,23
NA,consumer should get the products of pro-,23
NA,"tected industries at reasonable'rates, and",23
NA,that provision should be made in the Bill,23
NA,to that effect.,23
Mr GREGORY ,W e say that i f i t is,23
NA,found that a combination is charging un-,23
NA,"necessarily high prices for its goods, then",23
NA,on report to that effect,23
Mr RYAN , I am making a plain,23
NA,statement to which the honorable member,23
NA,"can assent, or from which he may dissent.",23
NA,I say that he has laid down a proposition.,23
Mr GREGORY ,No t on the lines the,23
NA,honorable member just indicated. I have,23
NA,not laid down any proposition.,23
Mr RYAN ,The n the honorable,23
NA,"member ought to have, done so. Any one",23
NA,who aspires to be deputy leader of a party,23
NA,should he prepared to lay down a pro-,23
NA,position to which he will adhere. I pro-,23
NA,pose to show that the attitude of the,23
NA,honorable member is ridiculous and can-,23
NA,"not commend itself to this House, much",23
NA,less to the public. I agree that there,23
NA,should be legal provision in order to give,23
NA,effect to the proposition that consumers,23
NA,sliould be ableto get goods at reasonable,24
NA,rates. For tbat reason I supported tbe,24
NA,amendment of tbe honorable member,24
NA,Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) that the Bill,24
NA,should be recast to provide that primary,24
NA,producers and general consumers should,24
NA,obtain manufactured articles at reasonment,24
NA,"able rates, while, at the same time,",24
NA,engaged in industries should receive,24
NA,proper conditions and fair wages.,24
Mr STEWART ,Yo u were defeated,24
NA,upon that. Now help ifs to secure this.,24
Mr RYAN ,W e were defeated by the,24
NA,"votes of honorable members in the Corner,",24
NA,who now contend that they want to do,24
NA,something effective in the same,24
NA,I desire to show that they prevented us,24
NA,from being able to do anything to see,24
NA,that the consumer got a manufactured,24
NA,article at a reasonable rate. They do profiteer.,24
NA,"not intend to secure that now. Certainly,",24
NA,tlie move which they have made cannot,24
NA,effect such a purpose. The proposition,24
NA,of the honorable member for Wimmera,24
NA,( Mr Stewart) means giving a free hand,24
NA,to those who may choose to form comthe,24
NA,bines or monopolies to do exactly,24
NA,they like. The honorable member would,24
NA,impose an obligation upon the manufacof,24
NA,turers of articles in Australia to see,24
NA,those to whom they sold retail the,24
NA,goods at reasonable rate. But he gives,24
NA,"the manufacturers , absolute discretion",24
NA,concerning the persons to whom they,24
NA,sell. That is the very thing we want,24
NA,prevent. We desire to insure that,24
NA,facturers shall sell to every person,24
NA,is willing to pay a reasonable price for,24
NA,their goods; and the conditions - governin,24
NA,ing a reasonable price must ibe laid,24
NA,by the law. Once we affirm the principle,24
NA,that the manufacturer may sell to whom,24
NA,he desires we establish the very conditions,24
NA,of which we have most to complain. A,24
NA,striking example Avas given last evening the amendment.,24
NA,when an honorable member related the,24
NA,-,24
NA,case of a retailer in a country town,24
NA,"was* a shareholder in a certain factory,",24
NA,but was unable to buy the goods which,24
NA,"produced in his own town, and had to",24
NA,send to Sydney for supplies.,24
Mr MCWILLIAMS ,Hav e not the,24
NA,brewers and the Tobacco Trust been,24
NA,doing that kind of thing for a long time?,24
Mr RYAN ,rAn d does the honorable,24
NA,member approve?,24
Mr MCWILLIAMS ,No !,24
NA,[409]- 2,24
Mr RYAN ,No r do I . We want to,24
NA,end it. The honorable member for Bal-,24
NA,for larat ( Mr MCGrath) has prepared an,24
NA,"amendment which, I think, will prevent",24
NA,any such state of affairs as that continu-,24
NA,i,24
NA,- ing. But 'my main objection to the amend-,24
NA,under discussion is its absurdity.,24
NA,those The only power that Parliament has,24
NA,under the Bill is the power to reduce or,24
NA,remove the duty. I f one retailer is sell-,24
NA,ing an article at an unreasonable price,24
NA,"it is very unfair to remove the duty, and",24
NA,so take away protection from manufac-,24
NA,"turers who may be selling to retailers,",24
NA,who are distributing at a reasonable price.,24
NA,I t is of no use to destroy tho whole in-,24
NA,direction. dustry in that way.,24
Mr STEWART ,Th e manufacturer,24
NA,should get another retailer who will not,24
Mr RYAN ,I f tbe honorable member,24
NA,thinks tliat that kind of reasoning will,24
NA,appeal to an intelligent public he is con-,24
NA,siderably mistaken. I would not have,24
NA,"risen, but that I wished to drive home",24
NA,patent fact that the honorable mem-,24
NA,what ber who moved the amendment is not,24
NA,only incompetent to deal with a subject,24
NA,"such importance, but that those who",24
NA,that support him are similarly incompetent.,24
Mr RICHARD FOSTER ,Wakefield),24
NA,[11.34] - I sympathize with the aims,24
NA,and objects of the mover of the,24
NA,"may amendment, but I cannot perceive that",24
NA,to his method of procedure is likely,24
NA,manuto bear result. .1 wish to point out,24
NA,who where a considerable practical bene-,24
NA,fit might accrue. The only effective way,24
NA,which any material good can be gained,24
NA,down for the people under this Bill is by,24
NA,widening the field of distribution with as,24
NA,little intervening profit as possible to the-,24
NA,manufacturers who have been protected.,24
Mr STEWART ,Tha t is the object of,24
Mr RICHARD FOSTER ,Bu t i t,24
NA,who cannot hope to secure the best results.,24
NA,There are very few woollen mills in. Aus-,24
NA,i t tralia which are not bound by agreements,24
NA,to. a very narrow system of distribution.,24
NA,Nearly all the mills are compelled to sell,24
NA,to the big warehouses. I know of only,24
NA,"one, namely, the Lobethal Mills, in South",24
NA,"Australia, which make their output avail-",24
NA,able to every distributorin the trade.,24
Mr GROOM ,Th e honorable member,24
NA,says that among other distributors there,24
NA,is a combination in restraint of trade and,24
NA,commerce.,24
Mr RICHARD FOSTER ,"I u effect,",25
NA,"tliat is so. Possibly, there are good rea-",25
NA,"sons, since I wish to be fair. Perhaps it",25
NA,does not pay the manufacturers to be dis-,25
NA,tributors also. I t may be that an agree-,25
NA,ment entered into with the wholesale,25
NA,houses to undertake distribution proves,25
NA,as profitable to the manufacturers as,25
NA,undertaking distribution direct; but I,25
NA,ask the Minister . ( Mr Greene) to,25
NA,make i t incumbent upon the manu-,25
NA,facturers of a protected article to,25
NA,see that that article is available for,25
NA,distribution to the entire trading com-,25
NA,munity. The only penalty I would im-,25
NA,pose is that provided in this Bill. I f,25
NA,the manufacturers are to continue to bene-,25
NA,fit from the protection which has beeu,25
NA,"afforded them, -their goods must be made",25
NA,available to the whole trade. I n the,25
NA,"woollen. mills, there are two profits. I f",25
NA,"ono profit will secure distribution, in-",25
NA,"stead of the Iwo, why should it not be",25
NA,possible to conduct activities in that man-,25
NA,"ner? I know, of course, that there are",25
NA,practical difficulties. I t has been a matr,25
NA,ter of grievance to the retail trade that,25
NA,they have not been able to go to the,25
NA,manufacturers direct and pass on the,25
NA,benefit to their customers. I am asking,25
NA,for more than the mere power of inquiry,25
NA,by the Board.,25
Mr GROOM ,I f a manufacturer makes,25
NA,an agreement with a limited number of,25
NA,"distributors, and that agreement is i n re-",25
NA,"straint of trade, an inquiry can be held",25
NA,under the terms of this Bill.,25
Mr RICHARD FOSTER , I want,25
NA,"more than that, namely, that the manu-",25
NA,facturer should be made to throw open,25
NA,his articles for general sale throughout,25
NA,the trading community.,25
Mr GROOM ,Thi s Parliament cannot,25
NA,pass a direct law to say expressly that,25
NA,any individual shall sell his goods to cer-,25
NA,tain persons.,25
Mr RICHARD FOSTER , I am not,25
NA,"asking for price-fixing, but that the Go-",25
NA,vernment shall make really effective the,25
NA,penalty which it is possible to impose,25
NA,under this Bill. The way to do that is,25
NA,to say that goods shall be made available,25
NA,for sale to the entire trade. I am,25
NA,not asking the Minister to provi.de that,25
NA,every factory shall be a distributing,25
NA,"agency for its own goods, and send travel-",25
NA,lers all over the country. But I do ask,25
NA,him to provide that those goods shall be,25
NA,available to the wholetrade. The manu-,25
NA,facturer could be told that i f his goods,25
NA,were not supplied to the consumer at,25
NA,lower prices the duty would be reduced or,25
NA,removed. That is the only penalty for,25
NA,'which I ask.,25
Mr GABB ,I call attention to the,25
NA,state of the Committee. [Quorum,25
NA,formed.],25
Mr RICHARD FOSTER , I ask the,25
NA,Acting Attorney-General ( Mr Groom),25
NA,to explain in what way the provision I,25
NA,am suggesting would be legally imprac-,25
NA,ticable.,25
Mr GROOM ,Thi s Parliament cannot,25
NA,directly impose any obligation on a manu-,25
NA,facturer in Victoria as to how he shall,25
NA,"conduct his trade within, that State. But",25
NA,"the Board can, under the terms of tho",25
NA,"Bill, inquire as to whether he is acting",25
NA,in restraint of trade in the way indicated,25
NA,"by the honorable member, and if i t is",25
NA,reported by the Board that he is doing,25
NA,so this House can' decline to continue the,25
NA,duty.,25
Mr RICHARD FOSTER , I desire,25
NA,some provision inserted that the manuf ac^,25
NA,turer of goods supported by a highly-pro-,25
NA,tective Tariff shall make such goods avail-,25
NA,able to the entire distributing trade of,25
NA,theCommonwealth.,25
Mr GROOM ,Tha t is attempting to im-,25
NA,"pose an obligation on a man who, perhaps,",25
NA,is operating i n only one State.,25
Mr RICHARD FOSTER ,A t present,25
NA,we are giving protection to manufactu-,25
NA,rers who are acting in restraint of trade.,25
Mr MASSYGREENE ,I f i t is thought that a,25
NA,manufacturer is acting in restraint of,25
NA,"trade, ample"" power of inquiry is provided",25
NA,"in the clause, as drafted, and the Board",25
NA,can report to the Parliament that such,25
NA,restraint of trade is detrimental to the,25
NA,public.,25
Mr GREGORY ,Thi s is a very im-,25
NA,"portant Bill, and should be discussed be-",25
NA,"fore a f u l l Comniijtee. I call fon, a",25
NA,quorum.,25
Mr GROOM ,Th e honorable member,25
NA,was absent from the chamber a few,25
NA,moments ago.,25
Mr GREGORY , I was. I tried to count,25
NA,out the Bill. [Quorum formed.],25
Mr RICHARD FOSTER , I am dis-,25
NA,appointed with the view expressed by the,25
NA,"Acting Attorney-General, because this",25
NA,matter affects the publio interest very,25
NA,"closely. , A close corporation acting in re-",26
NA,straint of trade does not deserve protec-,26
NA,"tion, and I should have fought the Tariff",26
NA,"very keenly indeed i f I had"" not thought",26
NA,that we could insure that goods manufac-,26
NA,tured under a high Tariff would be dis-,26
NA,tributed to the people with less interven-,26
NA,"ing cost. I f that is legally impossible, we",26
NA,are apparently restricted to the power of,26
NA,getting the Board to inquire and report to,26
NA,Parliament. The intention of the Bill,26
NA,seems to me to be that the inquiry shall,26
NA,not go beyond the factories.,26
Mr GREENE ,Eichmond-Ministe r for,26
NA,Trade and Customs) [11.55] - I think,26
NA,I know what the honorable member for,26
NA,"Dampier"" ( Mr Gregory) desires to do,",26
NA,and I am just as anxious as he is to do,26
NA,it. What I have been striving for is a,26
NA,measure framed in such a way that there,26
NA,can be no doubt as to the constitutionality,26
NA,of the remedies we are proposing. We,26
NA,want to be sure that we have definite,26
NA,"power to do what we set out to do, and",26
NA,that the law will be effective i n achieving,26
NA,our purpose.,26
Mr GREGORY ,°-IS the Minister assum-,26
NA,ing that we have not constitutional power,26
NA,to do what I have suggested?,26
Mr MASSYGREENE , I am advised that i t,26
NA,is extremely doubtful that we have such,26
NA,power. When.a trade is carried on en-,26
NA,"tirely on competitive lines, the consumer,",26
NA,"generally speaking, is not charged too",26
NA,"much for his goods, but when there are",26
NA,"close corporations and rings, and trade",26
NA,arrangements which prevent free competi-,26
NA,"tion, the consumer probably is charged",26
NA,"too much. The clause, as drafted, en-",26
NA,ables the Minister to refer to the Board,26
NA,"of Inquiry, and report, inter alia-",26
NA,(Jl) any complaint that a manufacturer is,26
NA,tiiking undue advantage of tbe protection,26
NA,"afforded him by the Tariff, and in particular",26
NA,in regard to his-,26
NA,(i) charging unnecessarily high prices for,26
NA,"his goods, or",26
NA,(ii) acting in restraint of trade to the,26
NA,detriment of the public.,26
NA,I shall movb to add after sub-paragraph,26
NA,(ii) certain words which' I think will be,26
NA,effective in doing what the honorable,26
NA,member for Dampier wants to do.,26
Mr MATHEWS ,I f the Minister does,26
NA,what the honorable member for Dampier,26
NA,"wants to do, he will kill the Bill. I f he",26
NA,"does not understand that, he is not fit for",26
NA,"his job, and I am damned if I will stick",26
NA,with him! I am remaining in my place,26
NA,"here to save this Bill and the Tariff, and",26
NA,the honorable member for Dampier is try-,26
NA,ing to kill both.,26
Mr MASSYGREENE ,I f the idea of the,26
NA,honorable member for Dampier-is-to kill,26
NA,"the Tariff, no one can accuse me of co-",26
NA,operating with him i n that endeavour.,26
NA,After the amendment now before the,26
NA,"chair is disposed of, I shall move to"" add",26
NA,"after sub-paragraph (ii) the words "" o r",26
NA,(iii) acting in a manner which results i n,26
NA,unnecessarily high prices being charged,26
NA,"to the consumer for his goods.""",26
Mr RICHARD FOSTER ,Tha t implies,26
NA,what I want.,26
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Ther e is no doubt,26
NA,that we can link up very definitely with,26
NA,"the manufacturer, and the amendment",26
NA,will cover the particular point mentioned,26
NA,by the honorable member for Wakefield,26
NA,"( Mr Richard Foster), while also substan-",26
NA,tially meeting the position as put by the,26
NA,honorable member for Dampier ( Mr.,26
NA,Gregory). I feel confident that the latter,26
NA,gentleman has no idea of setting out on,26
NA,a general policy of price fixing.,26
Mr GREGORY , I have never been asr,26
NA,sociated with any such policy.,26
Mr RYAN ,Woul d the fact that a,26
NA,manufacturer sold to a retailer in the,26
NA,"ordinary course of business, and that the",26
NA,retailer sold at an exorbitant rate 'to the,26
NA,"consumer, constitute a cause for inquiry",26
NA,under the suggested amendment? ;,26
Mr MASSYGREENE ,No ; i t would not.,26
NA,"After all is said and done, we have to re--",26
NA,collect that we are not giving power to an,26
NA,"outside body to act, but merely power to",26
NA,report. The report must come to Parlia-,26
NA,ment as the final -Court for judgment.,26
Mr RYAN ,Th e amendment will not,26
NA,throw the responsibility on to the mana-,26
NA,"factiirer, as suggested by the honorable",26
NA,"member for Wimmera ( Mr Stewart), to",26
NA,follow up the retaileT?,26
Mr MASSYGREENE ,No .,26
Mr GREGORY ,I t is merely a matter,26
NA,of inquiry and report.,26
Mr RYAN ,"I n other words, the",26
NA,amendment does no more than the B i l l,26
NA,already does?,26
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Yes ; I think the,26
NA,amendment widens the scope of the Bill.,26
Mr RYAN ,Wha t does i t cover other,26
NA,than what is.already covered?,26
NA,"Mr.'GREENE -Well , i t covers those",26
NA,"classes of trading agreements which, fromi",26
NA,"their very nature, lead to the consumer",26
NA,being charged unnecessarily high prices -,26
NA,1,26
NA,e-.,26
Mr RYAN ,Tha t is already provided,27
NA,JOT under another sub-paragraph.,27
Mr MASSYGREENE , I am doubtful,27
NA,-whether i t is covered to the same extent;,27
NA,"in my opinion, the amendment widens the",27
NA,basis of the inquiry.,27
Mr BELL ,Th e Minister says that if,27
NA,a manufacturer of agricultural machines,27
NA,refused to supply machinery to a firm i n,27
NA,a country town he would be acting in,27
NA,restraint of trade; supposing the manu-,27
NA,facturer had one distributing firm in a,27
NA,"country town who refused to sell, would",27
NA,that be in restraint of trade?,27
Mr MASSYGREENE,"Yes , I think i t would;",27
NA,but it does not necessarily follow that it,27
NA,would be a detriment to the publicThe,27
NA,final test of whether or not any action i n,27
NA,restraint of trade can be properly taken,27
NA,"cognisance of, is whether i t is to the de-",27
NA,triment of the public.,27
Mr BELL ,I s there any reason why a,27
NA,manufacturer should not sell to any dis-,27
NA,tributor who cares to place an order with,27
NA,him? Could that be provided in the,27
NA,Bill?,27
Mr MASSYGREENE , I .do not think we can,27
NA,do that; I feel pretty confident that con-,27
NA,stitutional limitations would render such,27
NA,a provision null and void. What I pro-,27
NA,"pose, 1 think, is within our power.",27
Mr MCGRATH ,Ballarat) [12.3] - I,27
NA,do - not think i t matters whether the,27
NA,amendment is carried or not; and i f it,27
NA,"pleases the members of the Country party,",27
NA,"tbey are easily satisfied. After all, i t",27
NA,simply means that the Board will in-,27
NA,quire and define what are unnecessarily,27
NA,"high prices, and then report to this Cham-",27
NA,ber. We know how the parliamentary,27
NA,"machine works, and months, or years,",27
NA,may elapse without anything being done;,27
NA,it certainly does not mean cheap goods,27
NA,-for consumers. The only proper method,27
NA,would have 'been to test our constitutional,27
NA,powers by adopting the amendment of the,27
NA,honorable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr..,27
NA,Fen ton). The members of the Country,27
NA,"party, who have taken up hours with their",27
NA,"camouflaging amendments, were those",27
NA,"who voted, practically i n a body, against",27
NA,that proposal. I f that amendment had,27
NA,"been agreed to, the High Court would be",27
NA,given another opportunity of. deciding the,27
NA,"constitutional question, and, i n view of",27
NA,"-the recent decision, there was every reason",27
NA,to believe the constitutionality of the,27
NA,amendment would have been upheld.,27
Mr BELL ,Tha t is just what the,27
NA,Country party do not desire!,27
Mr MCGRATH ,Th e proposal of the,27
NA,Country party to-day is merely a pre-,27
NA,tence.,27
Mr BELL ,Th e effect of the amend-,27
NA,ment of the honorable member for Mari-,27
NA,byrnong would have been to increase the,27
NA,price of everything.,27
Mr MCGRATH ,W e were prepared,27
NA,"to take the risk of that; in any case', the",27
NA,amendment before us will neither increase,27
NA,nor decrease prices.' I shall vote neither,27
NA,for nor against it.,27
Mr MARR ,Parkes) [12.5] -Afte r,27
NA,listening to the arguments of the honor-,27
NA,able member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett),27
NA,and the honorable member for Dampier,27
NA,"( Mr 'Gregory), and to the legal argu-",27
NA,ments by lawyers on both sides,27
Mr GREGORY ,On e of those members,27
NA,"has not read the Bill-a t any rate, he",27
NA,knows nothing about it -,27
Mr MARR ,I n my opinion as a lay-,27
NA,"man, the honorable member for Gram-",27
NA,pians does not realize the powers we lack.,27
Mr RYAN ,Yo u could express the,27
NA,same plain conclusion in a homely way !,27
Mr MARR ,Th e honorable member,27
NA,for Grampians suggests that the onus of -,27
NA,responsibility of selling goods at unrea-,27
NA,sonable prices is on the. manufacturer.,27
NA,"Why, in the same sense, we might 3ay",27
NA,that the onus for selling milk at an un-,27
NA,reasonable price in the cities rests on the,27
NA,dairy farmer!,27
Mr RYAN ,O r on the manufacturer-,27
NA,the cow!,27
Mr MARR ,"Yes , or the cow itself.",27
NA,I t has been said that the manufacturer,27
NA,"controls the industry, but in 99 per cent,",27
NA,of cases the manufacturer has no more Jo,27
NA,do with the disposal of his goods than I,27
NA,have. My father was a manufacturer in,27
NA,"New South Wales for forty-four years,",27
NA,and he never controlled the selling of his,27
NA,"goods. On the contrary, every retailer con-",27
NA,trolled him; it was the retail houses which,27
NA,told him where he had to sell. There is,27
NA,not a manufacturer in New South Wales,27
NA,who has any more to do with the selling,27
NA,of bis goods to the consumer than has,27
NA,this House.,27
Mr GREGORY ,Ther e could be inquiry,27
NA,and report as to what was going on.,27
Mr MARR ,Eve n i f there were,27
NA,a report that a retailer was charg-,27
NA,ing more than he had a right to,27
NA,"do, what power would this Parlia-",28
NA,ment have to act? I f the Broken,28
NA,"H i l l Proprietary Company, or any other",28
NA,"of the big controlling influences, sells at",28
NA,"an exorbitant rate, we have power to wipe",28
NA,"out the Protection, but when a company",28
NA,sells through five or six subsidiary chan-,28
NA,"nels, the public ultimately may have to",28
NA,"pay 500 per cent, above the manufactur-",28
NA,ing costs. What could this Parliament,28
NA,do in such cases? I f there is any doubt,28
NA,as to tne accuracy of what I have just,28
NA,said in regard to the percentage ulti-,28
NA,"mately paid by the public, I am pre-",28
NA,pared to bring proofs next week.,28
Mr LIVINGSTON ,I f a retailer made,28
NA,such charges he would soon lose his,28
NA,business.,28
Mr MARR ,Bu t the cost is added to,28
NA,because the goods go through so many,28
NA,channels. When the Tariff was under,28
NA,"consideration, we' were told by Queens-",28
NA,land representatives that Queensland tim-,28
NA,"ber, sent to Melbourne, was first handled",28
NA,by the man who distributed it to the vari-,28
NA,"ous yards, and charged 2^ per cent., and",28
NA,then' distributed by the yards to the,28
NA,builders at a cost of 25 per cent. I f we,28
NA,add the charges made by the builder and,28
NA,others until the timber reaches the con-,28
NA,"sumer we find about 100 per cent, added",28
NA,to the cost of production in the forest or,28
NA,at the mill.,28
Mr LIVINGSTON ,I n what State does,28
NA,that take place?,28
Mr MARR ,I n every State in the,28
NA,Commonwealth.,28
Mr LIVINGSTON ,No t in South Aus-,28
NA,tralia ! ',28
Mr MARR ,I t is said that the manu-,28
NA,facturer of the Ford car controls the sell-,28
NA,ing price in Australia; but that is not,28
NA,correct.,28
Mr RICHARD FOSTER , I say it is!,28
Mr MARR ,Wha t the manufacturer,28
NA,says is that the car shall not be sold for,28
NA,less than a certain price -insuring,28
Mr RICHARD FOSTER ,Tb e price is,28
NA,arranged in America by the Ford Com-,28
NA,pany.,28
Mr MARR ,Tha t is not so. I have,28
NA,been in a place where it was possible to,28
NA,"buy Ford cars by the hundred at £36 each,",28
NA,but where could you buy one in Mel-,28
NA,bourne for £136? Can we compel the,28
NA,public to pay less or more than a certain,28
NA,amount? We cannot compel the retailer,28
NA,to sell to the public as our friends in the,28
NA,Corner suggest.,28
Mr STEWART ,W e can penalize the,28
NA,manufacturer.,28
Mr MARR , I have already explained,28
NA,"the position of the manufacturer, and",28
NA,illustrated my argument with a reference,28
NA,to the distribution of milk.,28
Mr STEWART ,Th o dairy farmers,28
NA,should themselves distribute their milk.,28
Mr MARR ,Wit h that I agree; in-,28
NA,"deed, the high cost of living is largely,",28
NA,due to lack of system in distribution.,28
Mr RYAN ,D o you suggest that i f tha-,28
NA,dairy farmer does not see that the retailer,28
NA,sells at a reasonable price his .cows should),28
NA,be confiscated?,28
Mr MARR , I do not think I would,28
NA,go as far as that.,28
Mr STEWART ,Th e interjection is,28
NA,very sarcastic-an d foolish.,28
Mr MARR , I understand the Coun-,28
NA,try party to aTgue that i f a dairy farmer,28
NA,knows that a retailer is selling his milk,28
NA,at an unreasonable price he heed not,28
NA,supply that retailer with any more. But,28
NA,can any one say tljat there is a dairy,28
NA,farmer anywhere who ever says where his,28
NA,milk shall or shall not be sold? The,28
NA,whole business is controlled by the distri-,28
NA,buting agencies.,28
Mr STEWART ,Coul d not the dairy,28
NA,farmers be their own distributing agents ?,28
Mr MARR ,Certainly .,28
Mr STEWART ,Wha t is there to pre-,28
NA,vent them under the Bill?,28
Mr MARR ,Wha t power has the Go-,28
NA,vernment to say that the dairy farmer,28
NA,"shall, be his own distributing agent? I",28
NA,hope the clause will remain as printed.,28
NA,"I n my opinion, the amendment will make",28
NA,not the slightest difference in the selling,28
NA,prices of commodities.,28
Mr BELL ,Darwin) [12.13] -Th e,28
NA,honorable member for Wakefield ( Mr.,28
NA,Richard Foster) has expressed my idea of,28
NA,what it is possible to do in the way of,28
NA,that goods are distributed to the,28
NA,"public at reasonable prices. We are told,",28
NA,"however, by the Acting Attorney-General",28
NA,( Mr Groom) that what is proposed can-,28
NA,not be done under the Constitution. Un-,28
NA,"like many other lay members, I do not",28
NA,profess to be able to interpret the Con-,28
NA,stitution better than the High Court has,28
NA,already done. There is an old saying,28
NA,that a man who is his own lawyer has a,28
NA,"fool for a client, and although we may",28
NA,interpret the Constitution to OUT own per-,28
NA,sonal satisfaction we are not likely to,28
NA,do so in the way acceptable to the Oourt.,29
NA,"We are, therefore, face to face with",29
NA,"trouble directly we endeavour, by Act of",29
NA,"Parliament, to insure that goods are sold",29
NA,at prices that will give satisfaction to,29
NA,the public generally.,29
Mr GREGORY ,I n Canada there are,29
NA,special arrangements under the Tariff,29
NA,Act to enable all protected goods to be,29
NA,followed up.,29
Mr GROOM ,"I n Canada, unlike Aus-",29
NA,"tralia, the trade and commerce power is",29
NA,complete. We have not the power we,29
NA,would like.,29
Mr GREGORY ,W e ought to try to get,29
NA,as nearly the same power as possible.,29
Mr BELL ,Th e Acting Attorney-,29
NA,General has said that we have no power,29
NA,to tell a manufacturer how he shall dis-,29
NA,tribute his goods within one State. So I,29
NA,should think we have not the power to,29
NA,interfere when the selling transaction is,29
NA,"oonfined to one State. """,29
Mr GROOM ,Th e Federal power is over,29
NA,Customs matters - and Inter-State and,29
NA,oversea trade. Trade - and commerce,29
NA,within a State is not within Pederal juris-,29
NA,diction.,29
Mr BELL ," I understand that, and",29
NA,therefore agree with the Minister and,29
NA,others who say that the amendment of,29
NA,the honorable member for Dampier can-,29
NA,nob be effective. His object is the same,29
NA,as that of the honorable member for,29
NA,"West Sydney ( Mr Ryan), though the",29
NA,"methods differ, and the members them-",29
NA,selves differ in their views of our power,29
NA,to enforce what they think should be,29
NA,done. I f the Minister's proposal is as,29
NA,near as we can go towards attaining our,29
NA,"end, I shall support i t ; but I should like",29
NA,"a closer definition of "" restraint of",29
NA,"trade."" The Board might make in-",29
NA,"quiries as to, among other things, the",29
NA,"conduct of a certain manufacturer,- whe-",29
NA,ther i t might reasonably be considered in,29
NA,"restraint of trade, and might report to",29
NA,"the House on .the subject, and we could",29
NA,then debate the question here for weeks,29
NA,and for months without coming to a sat-,29
NA,isfactory conclusion. The difficulties of,29
NA,doing so are illustrated by the discussion,29
NA,"on this clause. I t appears to me that,",29
NA,"although we wish to do what is right, we",29
NA,-shall probably not attain our ends by,29
NA,"this Bill, or-by any other. However, J",29
NA,"am willing"" to give the method a trial.",29
NA,"The inquiries of the Board, and its re-",29
NA,"ports to Parliament, will be wholesome reduced ?",29
NA,in their effect; but whether the methods,29
NA,of distributing manufactured goods can,29
NA,"be regulated, and penalties imposed for",29
NA,"the charging of unreasonable prices, is",29
NA,another matter. I have grave doubts on,29
NA,the subject. I f the Attorney-General and,29
NA,the Minister for Trade and Customs,29
NA,think that the suggestion of the honor-,29
NA,able member for Wakefield is impractic-,29
NA,"able and unconstitutional, I shall not",29
NA,"support it. But, i n my opinion, i t is the",29
NA,"best that can be done, and goes as far as",29
NA,we can go under the Constitution.,29
Mr GROOM ,"Darling Downs-Minis- """,29
NA,ter for Works and Railways) [12.20] -,29
NA,We have discussed this matter with the,29
NA,"Solicitors-General,"" and he agrees that",29
NA,there is the grave doubt about the con-,29
NA,stitutionality of the amendment of the,29
NA,honorable member for Dampier ( Mr.,29
NA,Gregory). Ministers: desire that the,29
NA,fullest investigations should be made into,29
NA,everything directly or indirectly con-,29
NA,"nected with the Tariff, so that no one",29
NA,may take undue advantage of the Tariff.,29
NA,The honorable member proposes that any,29
NA,complaint that a consumer is being,29
NA,charged unfair prices for protected ar-,29
NA,ticles shall be investigated. But suppose,29
NA,that a Sydney merchant were selling an,29
NA,"agricultural implement, manufactured",29
NA,"under the protection of the Tariff, to a",29
NA,"farmer in the Wagga district, and that",29
NA,the farmer complained that he was being,29
NA,charged an unfair price for that imple-,29
NA,"ment. I f the Board made an investigation,",29
NA,and called upon the merchant to answer,29
NA,"itsquestions, he, like in the Colonial",29
NA,"Sugar Refining Company, in a case in",29
NA,which a Royal Commission wished to ob-,29
NA,"tain evidence some time ago, would say,",29
NA,""" I shall not reply to your questions, and",29
NA,"you cannotcompel me to do so, because",29
NA,I bought the article in question within,29
NA,"the State, and sold i t within the State.",29
NA,"No Customs duty was collected on i t , and",29
NA,the transaction was wholly a State mat-,29
NA,"ter, with which you have no constitu-",29
NA,"tional power to interfere."" I n those cir-",29
NA,"cumstances, the investigation might not",29
NA,be possible.,29
Mr GREGORY ,Th e Board would re-,29
NA,port that it was complained that unfair,29
NA,"prices were being charged, and that the",29
NA,merchant concerned refused to give evi-,29
NA,dence on the subject.,29
Mr GROOM ,Bu t i t could do,29
NA,nothing more.,29
Mr STEWART ,Coul d not the duty be,29
NA,M i \ GEOOM -Woul d tliat be fair to,30
NA,"the manufacturer of tbe article, who, per-",30
NA,"haps, was in no way responsible for the",30
NA,.conduct of the merchant?,30
Mr STEWART ,"Th e effect would be ""to",30
NA,require him to make' a better choice of,30
NA,distributors - -,30
Mr GREGORY ,Ther e would be prim&,30
NA,-facia evidence in the. conduct,30
NA,chant that there was something to hide.,30
- Mr GROOM ,^-Parliament should not;,30
NA,"in Federal legislation,, assume powers and",30
NA,a jurisdiction .that it. may hot possess:,30
NA,"But we have tried ,to meet the honorable",30
NA,"member, and also to.meet the honorable",30
NA,member for -Wakefield ( Mr Eichard,30
NA,Foster). The protection of industry,30
NA,and the general regulation of distribution,30
NA,throughout the commiunity are two dis-,30
NA,"tinct matters. , There is no power to deal",30
NA,"directly with distribution,- and the hon-",30
NA,orable member for Dampier has asked us,30
NA,"to deal^with a matter concerning ""which",30
NA,serious doubts exist - The honorable,30
NA,member for Wakefield contends that. a,30
NA,"manufacturer should, in effect, be willing",30
NA,to sell his goods to every person who is,30
NA,ready to buy from him. But it is con-,30
NA,ceivable that a -concern might wish t.o,30
NA,save distributing costs by making arrange-,30
NA,ments with outside firms. Some of,30
NA,the big companiesain -Australia are pro-,30
NA,"viding their workmen with goods, and",30
NA,saving the cost of distribution by buying,30
NA,direct from the wholesale merchants.,30
NA,This Parliament could not impose on any,30
NA,"individual, as an express and positive",30
NA,"duty, that he should do what the",30
NA,honorable member for Wakefield sug-,30
NA,"gests, because it cannot dictate to an in-",30
NA,dividual in any State to whom he shall,30
NA,or shall not sell. I f a woollen manufac-,30
NA,"turer were making a trade arrangement,",30
NA,"resulting in higher prices being charged,",30
NA,the Minister's proposal would permit an,30
NA,investigation. He is willing to widen the,30
NA,scope of inquiry. I t is the consumer' who,30
NA,is entitled to make the complaint. He may,30
NA,"say, "" I was charged an undue price for",30
NA,"the goods which I purchased, owing to",30
NA,"some arrangement, agreement, or under-",30
NA,"standing which had that result""; and an",30
NA,investigation may be made into that com-,30
NA,plaint. The honorable member for Wake-,30
NA,field wishes to interfere in a case such,30
NA,as that i n which a man in a country,30
NA,town applies to a manufacturer to buy,30
NA,"his goods, and cannot get supplies, al-",30
NA,"though he .finds that the .manufacturer""",30
NA,"has arranged to sell to other persons,,",30
NA,:,30
NA,"and, as the result of that arrangement;-",30
NA,the would-be purchaser finds that he haa,30
NA,"ultimately to pay,, buying indirectly, un-i",30
NA,reasonably high prices.,30
Mr GREGORY ,Bu t the'Minister's .pro-^,30
NA,posal does not allow the Board to get into,30
NA,of the mer- touch with the consumer.,30
Mr GROOM ,Yes ; the consumer,30
NA,would be the complainant under the,30
NA,Minister's amendment. The inquiry,30
NA,would be into the complaint that unneces-,30
NA,sarily high prices were being charged to,30
NA,the consumer for goods.,30
Mr GREGORY ,Wha t is the difference,30
NA,between the Minister's proposal and,30
NA,mine ?,30
NA,Mr GROOM:-Th e honorable mem-,30
NA,ber's amendment ' includes .purely retail,30
NA,"transactions, in which the manufacturer",30
NA,is not concerned; but under the Minis-,30
NA,ter's proposal the manufacturer who is,30
NA,protected must be brought in. The Min-,30
NA,ister's proposal meets the honorable mem-,30
NA,"ber to a great extent, and tries to apply",30
NA,"undoubted constitutional powers, with a",30
NA,view to doing to some extent what the,30
NA,honorable member desires to have done.,30
NA,I f the consumer has been charged un-,30
NA,necessarily high prices he can make his,30
NA,"complaint, and the Board can report on",30
NA,it.,30
Mr CONSIDINE ,"S o far as I can see"",",30
NA,the only difference between the proposal,30
NA,of the honorable member for Dampier. and,30
NA,that of the Minister is that one speaks of,30
NA,"unfair prices, and the other of unneces-",30
NA,sarily high prices.,30
Mr FRANCIS ,Henty) [12.29] -W e,30
NA,are right in endeavouring to protect the,30
NA,"consumer in every possible way, and the",30
NA,amendment of the honorable member for,30
NA,Dampier ( Mr Gregory) opens the way,30
NA,"to doingthat. I n my opinion, the pro-",30
NA,posal of the Minister would not remedy,30
NA,"the charging of unduly high prices, be-",30
NA,cause the manufacturer of the' goods may,30
NA,not be responsible for the prices charged,30
NA,to the consumers of them. I recognise,30
NA,the constitutional difficulties in -the way,30
NA,of the acceptance of the amendment of,30
NA,"the honorable member for Dampier, but",30
NA,there is always a difference of opinion,30
NA,"among lawyers, both in this Chamber and",30
NA,"outside, as to the constitutional powers of",30
NA,the Commonwealth. When the last ap-,30
NA,peal was made to the people to agree to,30
NA,"certain amendments i n the Constitution,",31
NA,"there were constitutional lawyers, who",31
NA,urged that the Parliament already,31
NA,had the power to do that for which those,31
NA,amendments of the Constitution were,31
NA,sought. The Acting Attorney-General,31
NA,{ Mr Groom) has said that he has dis-,31
NA,cussed this amendment with the Solicitor-,31
NA,"General, and that both are convinced that",31
NA,it goes beyond our constitutional' autho-,31
NA,"rity, Thero are other lawyers who take",31
NA,"a different view, and it seems to me that",31
NA,we could do no harm by giving the con-,31
NA,sumer the benefit of the doubt. The,31
NA,"amendment simply, provides that the",31
NA,Board shall be called upon to inquire and,31
NA,report as to any complaint that the con-,31
NA,sumers are being charged unfair prices,31
NA,for protected articles. I approve of the,31
NA,"amendment, whereas it seems to me that",31
NA,the suggestion made by the Minister,31
NA,amounts merely to a repetition of some-,31
NA,thing already appearing in the clause.,31
Mr RYAN ,Assumin g that the local,31
NA,"manufacturer of spokes, about whom the",31
NA,honorable member has been so much con-,31
NA,"cerned, sold them at a reasonable rate,",31
NA,but that some retailer of those spokes in,31
NA,an outback district charged unreasonable,31
NA,"prices for them, would the honorable",31
NA,member punish the manufacturer by tak-,31
NA,ing off the protective duty?,31
Mr FRANCIS , I recognise that it,31
NA,is difficult to control prices throughout the,31
NA,"States. ""We cannot exercise the control",31
NA,we desire unless we have a uniform fixa-,31
NA,tion of prices throughout the Common-,31
NA,"jwealth. We can, however, throw upon",31
NA,manufacturers the onus of showing that,31
NA,they have set up a system of distribution,31
NA,that will avoid exorbitant charges to the,31
NA,consumer. During the Tariff debate it,31
NA,was suggested that high duties might give,31
NA,"rise to monopolies and combines, but if",31
NA,? the people of Australia have to deal with,31
NA,a combine i t is better that i t should be,31
NA,".within the Commonwealth, where we can",31
NA,""" jcontrol i t , rather than overseas, where we parties.",31
NA,could not hope to control it. We have to,31
NA,"make the best of a bad job, and I am in-",31
NA,clined to think that the amendment moved,31
NA,hy the honorable member for Dampier will,31
NA,show the people of this country that we,31
NA,"are sincerely anxious to protect, the con-",31
NA,sumer. Where complaint is made that,31
NA,"unfair prices are being charged, the",31
NA,"Tariff Board, under the amendment,",31
NA,.would be called upon to investigate and,31
NA,"report, and on receipt of its report it",31
NA,would be for the Parliament itself to de-,31
NA,termine whether or not the protective duty,31
NA,affecting the industry concerned should,31
NA,be reduced or abolished. I hope that the,31
NA,Minister will accept the amendment.,31
Mr GREGORY ,Dampier) [12.35] -,31
NA,"Throughout the Tariff debate, when we",31
NA,suggested that the imposition of high,31
NA,duties would mean increased cost to the,31
NA,"consumer, i t was pointed out again and",31
NA,again by honorable members on both sides,31
NA,of the House that the Tariff Board would,31
NA,be able to take action to insure that rea-,31
NA,sonable prices were charged for the pro-,31
NA,ducts of protected industries. The Min-,31
NA,ister said that legislation would be,31
NA,brought forward to protect the consumer,31
NA,from unfair prices. That legislation is,31
NA,now before us; but i n submitting this,31
NA,"amendment, apparently, I have touched",31
NA,upon a very sore spot. I do not think i t,31
NA,would have been out of place had I asked,31
NA,that the Board should have pow«r to in-,31
NA,quire into the collection and distribution,31
NA,of moneys for the purposes of Tariff re-,31
NA,"form, or how such funds have reached",31
NA,various political ogranizations.,31
Mr RYAN ,Tha t must be a subject,31
NA,about which the honorable member knows,31
NA,a good deal.,31
Mr GREGORY ,Som e grave in-,31
NA,"sinuations, and, indeed, libellous state-",31
NA,ments have been published with regard to,31
NA,"the Country party, and I challenged the",31
NA,"Minister ( Mr Greene), in the earlier",31
NA,"stages of the debate on the Tariff, to go",31
NA,into that matter.,31
Mr RYAN ,I f the honorable member's,31
NA,party is free from any. taint of that,31
NA,sort,31
Mr GREGORY ,I t is absolutely,31
NA,free.,31
Mr RYAN , I dp not suggest that i t is ',31
NA,"not free from such a taint; but, if i t is,",31
NA,the honorable member should be the last,31
NA,to throw such an insinuation at other,31
Mr MASSYGREENE ,I t is best to ignore such,31
NA,insinuations.,31
Mr GREGORY ,Th e honorable mem-,31
NA,ber for West Sydney ( Mr Ryan) was.,31
NA,anything but generous in his remarks,31
NA,concerning the Country party a little,31
NA,while ago.,31
Mr RYAN , I did not suggest anything,31
NA,improper.,31
Mr GREGORY , I was not referring,31
NA,to the honorable member or his party,31
NA,when I alluded to this question of distri-,32
NA,bution of moneys collected for the pur-,32
NA,poses of Tariff reform. B u t I cannot,32
NA,help realizing the extent to which three,32
NA,or four big organizations i n this country,32
NA,have beeu obtaining control during the,32
NA,"last three or four years, and the great",32
NA,danger attaching to such a development.,32
NA,"We are told that i t is impossible, under",32
NA,"the. Commonwealth Constitution, to take",32
NA,action similar to that for which provi-,32
NA,sion is made in the Canadian Tariff A c t .,32
NA,"That A c t contains no reference to "" re-",32
NA,"straint of trade,"" but provides that i f",32
NA,there is anything i n the way of a com-,32
NA,bination or arrangement,32
Mr RYAN , I think this'Tariff Board,32
NA,should have power to investigate the,32
NA,question of whether any contribution is,32
NA,made to party funds. I will support the,32
NA,honorable member up to the hilt i f he,32
NA,will move an amendment to that effect.,32
Mr GREGORY , I t would be a very,32
NA,good thing i f that could be done. Libel-,32
NA,lous charges have been made as to contri-,32
NA,butions to our party funds by certain i n -,32
NA,terests.,32
Mr GABB , I do not think any manu- -,32
NA,facturers would contribute to the funds,32
NA,of the Country party.,32
Mr GREGORY ,Hardly .,32
Mr GROOM , I have seen no such*,32
NA,"charges published. """,32
Mr GREGORY ,The n the honorable,32
NA,gentleman does not read the Age or the,32
NA,Industrial Australian. We have had,32
NA,high legal opinion that the statements of,32
NA,which I complain are grossly libellous.,32
NA,The Canadian Tariff A c t makes i t clear,32
NA,"that i f , i n regard to any article of com-",32
NA,"merce there exists any conspiracy, com-",32
NA,"bination, agreement, or arrangement of",32
NA,any kind among manufacturers of such,32
NA,"article, or dealers therein, action shall",32
NA,bo taken. Although we have not the,32
NA,wide power enjoyed by the Canadian,32
NA,"Dominion Parliament, we certainly have",32
NA,the power of inquiry. A l l I am asking,32
NA,in my amendment is that the Board,32
NA,shall have specific authority to inquire,32
NA,into complaints that consumers are being,32
NA,charged unfair prices for protected,32
NA,articles.,32
Mr BELL ,Th e Acting Attorney-,32
NA,General ( Mr Groom) says that we have,32
NA,not that power.,32
Mr GREGORY ,Tha t is absurd.,32
NA,May I remind honorable members of the,32
NA,powers that we conferred on the Inter-,32
NA,State Commission. Section 16 of the,32
NA,Inter-State Commission Act provides,32
NA,that-,32
NA,The Commission shall be charged witb the,32
NA,"duty of investigating, from time to time, all",32

NA,"try and trade, generally.",32
Mr BELL , B u t not as to prices.,32
Mr GREGORY ,An d also^ as to,32
NA,prices. We gave the Inter-State Com-,32
NA,mission power also -to inquire into-,32
NA,(e) prices of commodities;,32
NA,(/) profits of trade and manufacture.,32
NA,and so forth . This Board should have,32
NA,power to inquire into the prices of com-,32
NA,modities and the ..profits of trade and,32
NA,manufacture.,32
Mr GROOM ,Bu t ever since the deci-,32
NA,sion of the P r i v y Council i n the case of,32
NA,the Colonial Sugar Refining Company,32
NA,the extent of the power to require evi-,32
NA,dence on oath as to those matters has been,32
NA,the subject of doubt.,32
Mr GREGORY ,W e have had be-,32
NA,fore us the balance-sheet of the Broken,32
NA,"H i l l Proprietary Company, which shows",32
NA,"that, although the mine was closed down",32
NA,"for two years, its net profits i n respect",32
NA,of a ll its activities over a three-year,32
NA,"period, amounted to £1,800,000, or",32
NA,"£600,000 a year. The Minister ( Mr -",32
NA,"Greene) slipped a duty through the*Com,-",32
NA,"mittee late one evening, and we did not",32
NA,have time to consider i t . I do not know,32
NA,whether he realized at the time what,32
NA,"would be' its ' effect, but i t was subse-",32
NA,"quently reported to us f r o m Perth that,",32
NA,"under that duty, £18 per ton was being",32
NA,charged on 14-gauge wire. That was an,32
NA,ad valorem duty. I f we found any com-,32
NA,pany taking the fullest advantage of the,32
NA,"protection granted them, and making",32
NA,enormous profits by charging unfafir,32
NA,"prices, surely we should be able to call",32
NA,upon the Board to make inquiry and re-,32
NA,port !,32
NA,:,33
Mr MASSYGREENE ,The . Board has f u l l,33
NA,-power to inquire into questions as to the,33
NA,profits of companies that are charging,33
NA,"unnecessarily high prices for their, goods.",33
NA,The clause as it stands covers the whole,33
NA,question of profits.,33
Mr GREGORY ,W e gave the Inter-,33
NA,"State Commission power to inquire into,",33
NA,not only the subjects I have already enu-,33
NA,"merated, but wages and social and",33
NA,industrial conditions. I n support of my,33
NA,"desire , I quoted last night the Canadian",33
NA,1,33
NA,"Act. My object"" ia to get as near to",33
NA,that legislation as possible. Heavy duties,33
NA,have been imposed by this Parliament.,33
NA,"Although i t may be difficult to prove, we",33
NA,feel satisfied that there are combinations,33
NA,in existenoe in connexion with many,33
NA,forms of trading interests in Australia.,33
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Th e same remark ap-,33
NA,"plies to ""the importers.",33
Mr GREGORY , I do not desire that,33
NA,the proposed Board shall worry over,33
NA,trifles. Its duties should be turned to,33
NA,"the bigger things. Por example, if i t is",33
NA,'found that an important manufacturing,33
NA,organization of the calibre of the Broken,33
NA,H i l l Proprietary Company has entered,33
NA,"into a combination to fix prices, or to deal",33
NA,only with certain persons.,33
Mr GROOM ,Ther e is complete power,33
NA,of inquiry afforded in the Bill.,33
Mr RYAN ,I t would not be possible,33
NA,to punish a manufacturer unless the re-,33
NA,sponsibility could be sheeted home to,33
NA,. him .,33
Mr GREGORY ,Al l I am asking is,33
NA,that the Board should have the power to,33
NA,"make inquiries, and, if the party con^",33
NA,cerned refused to furnish any informa-,33
NA,"tion, that should be taken as primd facie",33
NA,evidence of a case for submission.,33
Mr RYAN , I am with the honorable,33
NA,"member ""up to that point, but we must",33
NA,see that we do not punish an innocent,33
NA,person for a guilty one.,33
Mr GREGORY ,Th e matter would,33
NA,eome before Parliament. The Board,33
NA,would report that i t considered that there,33
NA,was something in the nature of a com-,33
NA,"- bination, and. that unfair prices were",33
NA,being charged for a protected article.,33
Mr RYAN ,"Then , does not the com-",33
NA,promise offered by the Minister ( Mr.,33
NA,Greene) meet the case?,33
Mr GREGORY , I contend that my,33
NA,proposal would do so. I want to bring,33
NA,the dealer in as well. I am only asking,33
NA,that there should be a Board of Inquiry,33
NA,through which Parliament should be,33
NA,made conversant with anything i n the,33
NA,"nature of a combination, or an attempt",33
NA,to unfairly fix prices.,33
Mr RYAN , I am afraid that the hon-,33
NA,orable member will be setting np an un-,33
NA,"sound principle, which some unjust Go-",33
NA,vernment may apply to primary pro-,33
NA,"ducers, and make them responsible for",33
NA,following their primary product right to,33
NA,the consumer.,33
Mr GREGORY , I am not afraid of,33
NA,that. I t is the duty of every member to,33
NA,try to protect the consumer. Honorable,33
NA,members have been doing their best to,33
NA,"aid the manufacturer. Now, having put",33
NA,"him on a good wicket, they should insure",33
NA,fair play for the consumer. I believe,33
NA,that my amendment will tend to effect,33
NA,"whab is necessary, although i t does not go",33
NA,as far as I could wish. But I am disap-,33
NA,pointed with the Bill. I t contains next,33
NA,"to nothing, after all the fine promises of",33
NA,the Government.,33
Mr MCGRATH ,Th e honorable mem-,33
NA,ber voted against the proposed alteration,33
NA,".of the Constitution, which would have",33

Mr RYAN ,An d the honorable mem-,33
NA,ber voted against the amendment of the,33
NA,honorable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr.,33
NA,Penton.).,33
Mr GREGORY ,Mos t decidedly! I,33
NA,am opposed to the principle of the New,33
NA,"Protection. I want nothing, so far as",33
NA,the primary producer is concerned. He,33
NA,is going to be pretty well ruined by the,33
NA,Tariff. I take with a grain of salt any-,33
NA,thing which the Minister ( Mr Greene),33
NA,may say about his keen desire to help the,33
NA,producer.,33
Mr RYAN , I agree with the honor-,33
NA,able member that this Bill is only camou-,33
NA,flage; but I point out that he helped to,33
NA,put i t in its present form.,33

Mr MASSYGREENE ,Th e Board will have,34
NA,to determine whether a gentlemanly,34
NA,agreement came within the various,34
NA,qualifications of restraint of trade,34
NA,which the honorable member has,34
NA,"mentioned, and i t might determine",34
NA,that i t did notI think it is better to,34
NA,adhere to the wider language employed,34
NA,in the clause as drafted. I have no,34
NA,jection to the amendment which the hon-,34
NA,"orable member suggests, but I think i t",34
NA,will have the effect of limiting,34
Mr GROOM ,Darling Downs-Minis -,34
NA,ter for Works and Railways and Acting,34
NA,Attorney-General) [2.18] -Th e addition,34
NA,of the specific words ending with,34
NA,"""general"" in the amendment which",34
NA,the honorable member for Dampier,34
NA,"has suggested would, under the",34
NA,"NOES. ordinary rule of interpretation, refer",34
NA,back to the preceding words and imply,34
NA,some action in the nature of conspiracy,34
NA,or combination. That is the doctrine of,34
NA,"ejusdem generis. The clause, as drafted,",34
NA,covers any restraint of trade whether by,34
NA,"conspiracy, agreement, combination, or",34
NA,"individual action. The word "" con-",34
NA,"spiracy"" means several persons acting",34
NA,together with a certain intention. Agree-,34
NA,PAIB. * ment and arrangement ' also suggest a,34
NA,"number of persons, but restraint of trade",34
NA,might be an individual act. Suppose that,34
NA,one company has a monopoly of the,34
NA,"manufacture of certain goods, there could",34
NA,be neither conspiracy nor agreement^ and,34
NA,the honorable member's suggested amend-,34

NA,(iv) refusing to sell to any person goods,34
NA,to the value of fifty pounds at,34
NA,the clause - current market rates.'.' .,34
NA,The purpose of the amendment is to com-,35
NA,pel manufacturers to accept small orders:,35
NA,I realize that the high cost of living is,35
NA,largely due to the present extravagant,35
NA,"methods of distribution, which may",35
NA,"render ineffective ,any legislation we at-",35
NA,tempt against profiteering. I heard a,35
NA,gentleman say the other day that cloth-,35
NA,produced at a woollen mill in Geelong,35
NA,was sold in Plinders-lane at 12s. per,35
NA,"yard, and re-sold to tailors i n Geelong at",35
NA,32s. per yard. That discloses an ex-,35
NA,"orbitant cost of distribution, and I am",35
NA,informed that tailors in Geelong are un-,35
NA,able to get any of the cloth locally manu-,35
NA,"factured for making up into suits, and I",35
NA,know that the same difficulty is experi-,35
NA,enced in other centres where woollen,35
NA,mills are operating.,35
Mr MCWILLIAMS ,Wha t about,35
NA,manufacturer who makes a contract to,35
NA,sell his whole output?,35
Mr MCGRATH ,I f the amendment,35
NA,"is carried, a number . of consequential",35
NA,"amendments will be necessary, and Ave",35
NA,can easily deal with cases of that charac-,35
NA,ter. We can refuse to allow a manufac-,35
NA,turer to accept an offer for the whole of,35
NA,his output. This Parliament particularly,35
NA,"desires to assist the woollen industry, and",35
NA,at the same time give an opportunity for,35
NA,.the locally-manufactured article to be,35
NA,sold at reasonable prices to the consumer.,35
NA,I understand that to-day not one mill,35
NA,will supply a tailor with any quantity of,35
NA,"sloth he requires. The amendment, i f",35
NA,"agreed to, will compel the manufacturer",35
NA,to sell to any tailor any quantity of,35
NA,cloth not less than £50 in value. I realize,35
NA,that i t might not be fair to compel a mill,35
NA,to sell a length of cloth to an individual-,35
NA,although the difficulties in the way of,35
NA,doing'that are not very great-bu t I can,35
NA,see no objection to one portion of a manu-,35
NA,facturing establishment being set aside,35
NA,to supply the distributing trade.,35
Mr CORSER ,Wha t about the financial,35
NA,aspect of such sales?,35
Mr MCGRATH ,Th e only financial,35
NA,"aspect I see is that from 50 per cent, to",35
NA,"15 per cent., and in some cases 150 per",35
NA,"cent., profit is being made by those who",35
NA,handle the cloth between the factory and,35
NA,the user. I t is not the manufacturer who,35
NA,gets the very high profit. I f any woollen,35
NA,mill sells less than a certain quantity of,35
NA,cloth it is boycotted by Plinders-lane.,35
Mr FRANCIS ,Woul d you compel the,35
NA,"small purchaser to pay the £50 i n cash,",35
NA,or should he have extended terms ?,35
Mr MCGRATH , I do not askthe,35
NA,manufacturer to sell to an uncertificated,35
NA,insolvent or to give credit to the small,35
NA,purchaser. A l l that I require is that he,35
NA,"shall be prepared to sell, and that means",35
NA,to sell for cash. The more Ave examine,35
NA,the matter the more we are forced to the,35
NA,conclusion that uneconomical methods of,35
NA,distribution are largely at the root of the,35
NA,"high cost of living. For instance, one",35
NA,baker's bread cart Avill arrive in a street,35
NA,"to* deliver bread to one house, and then",35
NA,depart for the house of another customer,35
NA,half a mile aAvay. Ten minutes later,35
NA,another baker's cart arrives to serve the,35
NA,"neighbour of the first customer, and so",35
NA,"the on. I n regard to boots, the retailer makes",35
NA,a profit of from 8s. to 12s. per pair on,35
NA,a pair of men's boots. Yet the retailers,35
NA,"are not becoming wealthy, becauso there",35
NA,are so many shops and such a large num-,35
NA,"ber of people employed, who are only",35
NA,"working two or three hours a day, that",35
NA,big profits must be made. The amend-,35
NA,ment provides an opportunity of dealing,35
NA,"Avith pne phase of distribution, particu-",35
NA,larly in regard to clothes. I t will compel,35
NA,the manufacturers to at least supply to-,35
NA,distributors. I t is true that the Board',35
NA,can only report to the Minister any in-,35
NA,"fringement of the laAv, but my intention",35
NA,i * that interference Avith the duty shall,35
NA,not be the only penalty. By that method,35
NA,we might seriously injure fifty millers who,35
NA,"were prepared to observe the law, and I",35
NA,therefore desire to provide for severe,35
NA,fines and penalties.,35
Mr GREGORY ,j^We cannot do that.,35
Mr MCGRATH , I am not at all,35
NA,satisfied that we cannot. We have for a,35
NA,long time believed that the powers con-,35
NA,ferred upon us by the Constitution are,35
NA,very limited by certain decisions given,35
NA,"by the High Court, but the personnel of",35
NA,"the Court has changed in recent years,",35
NA,and that tribunal has given very different,35
NA,decisions recently. I f Ave are honestly,35
NA,"desirous of protecting the consumer, we",35
NA,shall insert this amendment and let i t be,35
NA,tested in the High Court. I f it is not,35
NA,upheld we shall have an added reason,35
NA,for_ seeking an amendment of the Consti-,35
NA,tution immediately.,35
Mr RYAN ,I f we cannot enforce fines,35
NA,we can remit the duty.,35
NA,Mr MoGRATH -Quit e so. I t seems,36
NA,"to me foolish, when we know that in most",36
NA,"cases, for some time at any rate, the",36
NA,"added, duties will increase the cost of",36
NA,ing,36
Mr MCWILLIAMS ,Suppos e there are,36
NA,"half-a-dozen factories, and four of them",36
NA,"commit an offence, i f the duty is removed",36
NA,the other two are penalized also.,36
Mr MCGRATH , I have already said another.,36
NA,that I realize the difficulties in that direc-,36
NA,tion. I am not urging that manufacthe total profit is not great.,36
NA,turers are getting high profits. I n the,36
NA,woollen industry the manufacturers did,36
NA,"pretty well during the war, but so did as against another.",36
NA,every other manufacturer right throughnear,36
NA,out the British Dominions. I submit,36
NA,the amendment ought to be accepted.,36
Mr MARR ,Parkes) [2.32] -Ther e is gold mine for this country.,36
NA,certainly much to be' said in favour of,36
NA,"the amendment which has been submitted,",36
NA,but there are great difficulties in,36
NA,of carrying it into effect. The whole,36
NA,"trouble is our system, or lack of system,",36
NA,in distribution in all our industries.,36
NA,the woollen industry the position is very MCGrath).,36
NA,"difficult indeed, and the only way of",36
NA,overcoming i t is by extending the indusprice,36
NA,try. The supply of woollen garments,36
NA,is very small as compared with -the,36
NA,requirements. I f we manufacture only,36
NA,"20 per cent, of the public demands, and",36
NA,"supply the 80 per cent, by means",36
NA,"portations, we make it possible for one set",36
NA,of tailors to be given preference over,36
NA,"other, some being compelled to pay Brinot",36
NA,tish prices.,36
Mr MCGRATH , They will have to,36
NA,rely on the local industry.,36
Mr MARR ,Bu t that is not sufficient,36
NA,to supply the demand. No one would,36
NA,better pleased than myself i f we were able,36
NA,"not only to meet the local demand, but",36
NA,also to export.,36
Mr RYAN ,"A t any rate, the amendis",36
NA,ment would get over some of the existing,36
NA,evils.,36
Mr MARR , A specific case has come,36
NA,under my notice in New South Wales.,36
NA,"I n York-street, Sydney, which is the",36
NA,"Plinders-lane of that city, one",36
NA,"was taking about 10 per cent, of their",36
NA,requirements from local manufacturers any consideration -,36
NA,".at 10s. a yard, importing the balance",36
NA,from England at 45s. a yard. Instead,36
NA,of supplying the local tailors with,36
NA,"Australian article, and, perhaps, giving",36
NA,preference to one set of tailors,36
NA,"other, they lumped the two classes of",36
NA,"cloth together, and sold it at an average",36
NA,price of 42s. I admit that the difference,36
NA,"livbetween 10s. and 42s. seems a big profit,",36
NA,but when we consider that the ware-,36
NA,houses remitted 3s. a yard on the im-,36
NA,"ported article, the price is not so large.",36
Mr MCGRATH ,Th e warehouse loses,36
NA,"3s. on one transaction, and makes 32s. on",36
Mr MARR ,"Somethin g like that, but",36
NA,I com-,36
NA,"mend"" that plan, because i t avoids the",36
NA,giving of preference to one set of tailors,36
NA,I hope the time is,36
NA,when Parliament and the people,36
NA,will co-operate to establish more woollen,36
NA,"mills, for these would prove a veritable",36
NA,I f that,36
NA,"were done, we should be able to reduee",36
NA,to a large extent the excessive „ cost of,36
NA,the way clothing in Australia to-day.,36
Mr RILEY ,South Sydney) [2.35] -,36
NA,I hope the Minister will try to meet the,36
NA,I n honorable member for Ballarat ( Mr.,36
NA,I n New South Wales i t is,36
NA,admitted that York-street controls the,36
NA,"of tweeds and woollen goods, an4",36
NA,such a provision as that now moved,36
NA,public would do much good. Master tailors,36
NA,have told me that i f they could' buy,36
NA,direct from the mills the result would be,36
NA,of imbetter for the public.,36
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Richmond-Ministe r,36
NA,anfor Trade and Customs) [2.36] - I can-,36
NA,see my way to accept this amendment.,36
NA,I have inserted a provision which en-,36
NA,ables the Tariff Board to inquire and,36
NA,cover the whole of the ground that is,36
NA,covered by this proposal. The Board,36
NA,by that provision has power to inquire in,36
NA,be regard to anything done by a manufac-,36
NA,turer that results in an added cost to the,36
NA,"consumer; consequently, I say the ground",36
NA,is covered. A l l the Tariff Board can do,36
NA,"to inquire and report, and it can report",36
NA,to the House in regard to such matters -,36
NA,as come within the proposed amendment,36
NA,as they can in regard to the other matters.,36
NA,I t then rests with the House to determine,36
NA,whether a case has been made out for a,36
NA,warehouse reduction in the duty.,36
Mr GABB ,Th e small men will not gut,36
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Th e amendment will,36
NA,not compel a manufacturer to sell this,36
NA,"the £50 worth to anybody. I n any case, I",36
NA,cannot accept the amendment in the form,36
NA,over anin which i t is moved.,36
Mr RYAN ,Why ?,37
Mr MASSYGREENE ,A s i t stands the,37
NA,"amendment says, "" A manufacturer re-",37
NA,fuses to sell a person goods of the value,37
NA,"of not less than £50."" There might be",37
NA,a good and sumcient reason why a manu-,37
NA,"facturer should not desire to sell, or why",37
NA,he should not sell to any person.,37
Mr RYAN , That would not prevent,37
NA,an inquiry.,37
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Th e Board has f u ll,37
NA,power of inquiry.,37
Mr RYAN ,Tha t is another point.,37
Mr MASSYGREENE , I do not think this,37
NA,amendment should be accepted.,37
Mr RYAN ,West Sydney) [2.39] - I,37
NA,desire.to point out the fallacy in the ar-,37
NA,gument of the Minister ( Mr Greene) that,37
NA,his own amendment already covers the,37
NA,"ground. Of course, if that be so, there",37
NA,is nothing more to be said-i t does cover,37
NA,"the ground. My point, however, is that",37
NA,it does not. The amendment that has,37
NA,been inserted by the Committee deals with,37
NA,manufacturers who act in such a way as,37
NA,to put up the ultimate price to the con-,37
NA,sumer.,37
Mr GREENE ,A s to have the result,37
NA,of the consumer paying an unnecessarily,37
NA,high price.,37
Mr RYAN ,Quit e so. Supposing,37
NA,"that .a firm -in Flinders-lane "" put on the",37
NA,"screw"" in such a way as to compel a",37
NA,manufacturer to sell to them only.,37
Mr MATHEWS ,Whic h is done now.,37
Mr RYAN ,I n such case the Plinders-,37
NA,lane firm will not buy from the manufac-,37
NA,turer unless they are allowed -to take his,37
NA,"whole output, and he could not sell to",37
NA,any one else to the amount mentioned in,37
NA,the amendment. But i t cannot be said,37
NA,that the manufacturer is acting in such,37
NA,a way as to ultimately raise the price to,37
NA,the consumer. I t could not so raise the,37
NA,"price; the people doing that"" are the",37
NA,Plinders-lane merchants.,37
Mr GREENE ,Th e amendment speaks,37
NA,' of a manufacturer refusing to sell.,37
Mr RYAN ,Tha t is the difference.,37
NA,The honorable member for Ballarat ( Mr.,37
NA,MCGrath) desires the Board to inquire,37
NA,"into, all cases where a manufacturer re-",37
NA,fuses to sell quantities of not less than,37
NA,£50 -,37
Mr MCWILLIAMS ,"Suppose , as is often",37
NA,"the case, a manufacturer can get a rea-",37
NA,"sonable sale of a large lot, can i t be said",37
NA,"that he should not be permitted to do so,",37
NA,but must supply other people with small,37
NA,lots?,37
Mr RYAN ,I n such a case the manu-,37
NA,facturer would certainly be justified in,37
NA,selling; but a manufacturer with goods,37
NA,in stock at his factory must not refuse to,37
NA,sell direct to the small retailer. The cir-,37
NA,cumstances are to be discovered during,37
NA,"the inquiry. I t may be discovered, for",37
NA,"instance, that he is justified in refusing",37
NA,to sell-tha t he has not the goods or has,37
NA,to supply them to some one else. The,37
NA,whole genesis of his reason for refusing,37
NA,"would be laid bare, and we could act or",37
NA,", not as we thought fit. I t does not",37
NA,mean that because he refuses to sell he,37
NA,is necessarily penalized-tha t depends on,37
NA,circumstances. The honorable member,37
NA,for Ballarat simply desires the Board to,37
NA,have power to conduct an investigation.,37
NA,Is there any reason why the Board should,37
NA,not have that power? The Minister has,37
NA,not shown that his amendment covers the,37
NA,"same ground, while I submit that I have",37
NA,clearly shown that -it does not. The hon-,37
NA,orable member for Ballarat has made i t,37
NA,clear that his amendment would serve a,37
NA,-,37
NA,useful purpose in the direction of investi-,37
NA,gations conducted by the Board. I hope,37
NA,"the Minister will accept the amendment,",37
NA,"or, i f he does not, I hope i t will be ap-",37
NA,proved by the good sense of the Commit-,37
NA,tee.,37
Mr GROOM ,Darling Downs-Minis -,37
NA,:,37
NA,ter for Works and Railways) [2.41] - I,37
NA,should like honorable members to consider,37
NA,"the effect of this amendment, which pro-",37
NA,vides that a manufacturer who refuses to,37
NA,sell to any person goods of the value of,37
NA,"£50 at current market rates, shall come",37
NA,under the provisions of the Bill. This,37
NA,"amendment, I .point out, does not apply",37
NA,only to woollen mills and manufacturers,37
NA,in the cities; i t applies also to butter fac-,37
NA,"tories., cheese factories, fruit-canning",37
NA,"factories, possibly dried fruit associations,",37
NA,and all manufacturing concerns of the,37
NA,kind.,37
Mr RYAN ,The y will not be afraid of,37
NA,investigation.,37
Mr GROOM , I am merely showing,37
NA,the scope of this amendment.,37
Mr RYAN ,Yo u are trying to raise a,37

Mr GROOM ,Doe s the honorable,37

NA,information back?,37
Mr RYAN , N o ; but you are only try-,37
NA,ing to raise a bogey.,37
Mr GROOM ,Surel y the honorable ',37
NA,member will allow me to state the effect,37
NA,"of the amendment. I t might, for instance,",37
NA,have very serious results on co-operative,37
NA,associations.,37
Mr RYAN ,--Wha t dealings of the kind,38
NA,have co-operative concerns?,38
Mr GROOM ,Speakin g subject to corment to determine.,38
NA,"rection, I believe that in some of the",38
NA,States there are co-operative distributing,38
NA,"agencies, which take the whole of the",38
NA,put from the factories.,38
Mr STEWART ,Tha t is so.,38
Mr GROOM , According to the,38
NA,"amendment, any co-operative company tempt",38
NA,"trading in that way, if it refused to sell tions tototake",38
NA,to any person within the terms,38
NA,"amendment, might be doing something refor the protection of the for",38
NA,prehensible.,38
Mr RYAN ,No t necessarily repreTo,38
NA,hensible.,38
Mr GROOM ,"Tha t is the"" contention.",38
Mr FRANCIS ,The y would not have,38
NA,the goods to sell.,38
Mr GROOM , According to the,38
NA,"-amendment, that is no excuse.",38
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Th e goods are,38
NA,but consigned.,38
Mr RYAN ,Th e amendment only asks,38
NA,for an investigation.,38
Mr GROOM ,Th e object of the,38
NA,amendment is to make i t practically,38
NA,possible for a manufacturer to refuse,38
NA,sell goods to the value of £50 the,38
NA,at current market . . rates. I f,38
NA,is not the intention of the amendTo,38
NA,"ment, why is 'it proposed ? There is this",38
NA,objection: The Tariff has been passed,38
NA,the encouragement of local manufactures;',38
NA,but the problems of distribution within,38
NA,"the country are entirely another matter,",38
NA,and it would be unwise to assume a,38
NA,diction in regard to them which does not,38
NA,expressly belong to this Parliament.,38
Mr BELL ,Yo u think that it should,38
NA,be done in a separate Bill?,38
Mr GROOM ,I t is not a Tariff,38
NA,matter at all. Distribution within,38
NA,State-r-buying and selling-i s essentially,38
NA,- a matter for the State authorities. What,38
NA,we have to do is to ascertain whether,38
NA,manufacturers are talcing undue advandifferent,38
NA,tage of the protection given by the Tariff.,38
NA,I f i t is complained that they are doing,38
NA,"so, the Bill provides for an investigation,",38
NA,"and, should that investigation show",38
NA,"there is just cause -for complaint, this class of goods.",38
NA,"Parliament may, if i t thinks fit, remove",38
NA,"or reduce duties, and subject the offend-",38
NA,ing industry to the competition of the,38
NA,world.,38
Mr MCWILLIAMS ,I f in an industry,38
NA,in which half-a-dozen factories were,38
NA,gaged there were one or two offenders,38
NA,"only, would you remove or reduce the",38
NA,protective duty?,38
Mr GROOM ,No t necessarily. The,38
NA,action to be taken would be for Parlia-,38
Mr GREENE ,I f only one or two,38
NA,manufacturers out of a number were,38
NA,"outoffending, the public, as a whole, would",38
NA,"not suffer, because its interests would be",38
NA,secured by the competition of the others.,38
Mr GROOM ,I f manufacturers at-,38
NA,form associations or combina-,38
NA,"advantage of the Tariff,",38
NA,of the there is here machinery,38
NA,investigation,38
NA,public. The in-,38
NA,tention is not to deal with isolated cases.,38
NA,pass a B i l l to do that would be like,38
NA,using a steam hammer to crack a nut.,38
NA,The real danger against which this Par-,38
NA,liament has to guard is the association of,38
NA,manufacturers who are protected by the,38
NA,Tariff to prevent the public getting,38
NA,"a fair deal, and the Bill contains ma-",38
NA,"not sold, chinery for that end.",38
Mr MATHEWS ,Melbourne Ports),38
NA,[2.49] - A shopkeeper may be stocking,38
NA,"imported articles of a certain kind, and",38
NA,imarticles of the same kind which have,38
NA,"to. been manufactured locally, playing off",38
NA,imported against the locally-manu-,38
NA,that factured goods for his own advantage.,38
NA,safeguard against that we might pro-,38
NA,hibit those who stocked locally-manufac-,38
NA,for tured articles from' selling imported,38
NA,"articles, but that is hardly practicable.",38
NA,"The tailors, for instance, would object to",38
NA,it. The proposal of the honorable mem-,38
NA,jurisber for Ballarat ( Mr MCGrath) may be,38
NA,"called crude, but i t would be effective i f it",38
NA,"could be applied. Of course, i t would not",38
NA,"be fair to say to a manufacturer, "" Y o u",38
NA,must sell £50 worth of assorted goods for,38
NA,"the same price proportionately as £50,000",38
NA,"a worth."" A man giving an order for £50",38
NA,worth of cloth would Ibe ordering about,38
NA,"sixteen suit lengths, and these the manu-",38
NA,local facturer would have to cut from sixteen,38
NA,"bales, and i t would not be un-",38
NA,"fair, therefore, to allow him, at least, 10",38
NA,"per cent, more on such an order than he",38
NA,would get on a bulk order very much-,38
NA,"that larger, and perhaps entirely for one",38
Mr MCGRATH ,W e could allow that.,38
Mr MATHEWS ,Th e community is,38
NA,"prejudiced, not by the profits made by the'",38
NA,"manufacturer, so much as by the profits",38
NA,"enmade by the distributors, 100 or 150 per",38
NA,"cent, often being added to the manufac-",38
NA,turers' prices. But i t being the desire of,38
NA,the Committee to make Protection of,38
NA,"benefit to Australia, we should do our",39
NA,best to frame legislation which will secure,39
NA,this end. The Minister has made a,39
NA,suggestion which has been criticised by,39
NA,"certain honorable members, and other",39
NA,members have made suggestions which,39
NA,have likewise been criticised and regarded,39
NA,"suspiciously. This, of course, is natural.",39
NA,"I , myself, am always suspicious of sug-",39
NA,"gestions emanating from certain quarters,",39
NA,"my motto being, "" Beware of the Greeks",39
NA,"when they bring gifts."" What we need",39
NA,"to do is to get down to bedrock, and ascer-",39
NA,tain what our constitutional powers in,39
NA,this matter are. This is a' question that,39
NA,will have to be tested in the Courts. I t,39
NA,is not too much to insist that the manu-,39
NA,facturers whose industries we protect,39
NA,"shall deal fairly with the public, and sell",39
NA,small parcels to small men. We shall al-,39
NA,"ways have small men in business, and",39
NA,their interests must be considered. At,39
NA,"the same time, i t is bulk production and",39
NA,distribution that reduce costs. I f I,39
NA,thought that the Bill did all that was,39
NA,desirable for the protection of the com-,39
NA,"munity, I would accept i t ; but the Min-",39
NA,"ister, i f he desires to study the interests",39
NA,of the community as they should be,39
NA,"studied, should, with the aid of his offi-",39
NA,"cials, endeavour to devise some method of",39
NA,making operative the suggestion of the,39
NA,honorable - member for Ballarat. We,39
NA,shall not have a perfect Tariff until some,39
NA,"such suggestion is applied. Personally, I",39
NA,am a Prohibitionist. I would keep out,39
NA,all importations that might compete,39
NA,"against a protected industry, and I stood",39
NA,"alone at one election, so far as my own",39
NA,"party is concerned, on this point. I n my",39
NA,"opinion, this debate has been protracted",39
NA,uselessly. What we need is a provision,39
NA,"that will protect the consumer, and the",39
NA,suggestion of the honorable member for,39
NA,"Ballarat, i f i t can be applied constitu-",39
NA,"tionally, would help to do that.",39
Mr RICHARD FOSTER ,Wakefield),39
NA,.[2.53]- I think that the honorable mem-,39
NA,ber for Ballarat ( Mr MCGrath) should,39
NA,accept the statement of the Government.,39
NA,I am as desirous as he is that our manu-,39
NA,facturers shall sell openly to those who,39
NA,apply to them for goods; but it would be,39
NA,impossible to enforce the amendment,39
NA,literally. Our mills are limited in num-,39
NA,"ber and capacity, and cannot supply the",39
NA,demands of the local trade. You could,39
NA,"not, therefore, compel a man to sell £50",39
NA,worth of goods i f he had already cus-,39
NA,tomers who were unsupplied. A l l that,39
NA,we are likely to get out of the Bill is an,39
NA,inquiry and a report.,39
Mr GREGORY ,Tha t will be a good,39
NA,thing.,39
Mr RICHARD FOSTER ,Yes;'an d,39
NA,should meet the honorable member's,39
NA,wishes. When Parliament receives a re-,39
NA,"port from capable men, i t will be in a",39
NA,position to take what action i t may think,39
NA,right.,39
- Mr CHARLTON ,Hunter) [2.55] -I n,39
NA,"my opinion, the amendment is essential.",39
NA,We have been saying for a long while,39
NA,that i t is necessary to clip the wings of,39
NA,"the middleman as far as possible, and the",39
NA,' amendment would have that effect. I do,39
NA,not see how the constitutional question,39
NA,arises. I t is not as i f we were interfer-,39
NA,ing with trade. We simply say that the,39
NA,Board shall have the right to inquire-into,39
NA,certain matters which are affected by the,39
NA,Tariff. I f a factory which is enjoying,39
NA,the benefit of protection given to it by,39
NA,this Parliament refuses to supply an,39
NA,"order for £50 worth of goods, or more,",39
NA,"sent to it by any firm or individual, the",39
NA,Tariff Board will be able to inquire the,39
NA,"reason, and, on its report, Parliament can",39
NA,deal with the matter. The honorable,39
NA,member for Darling Downs ( Mr Groom),39
NA,endeavoured to make i t appear that that,39
NA,would be a contravention of the Consti-,39
NA,"tution, but I do not agree with him. We",39
NA,are not proposing to fix the price of any,39
NA,commodity. A l l we say is that protected,39
NA,manufacturers shall not refuse to supply,39
NA,an order for the value of £50 or more.,39
NA,"Of course, i f a manufacturer had not the",39
NA,1,39
NA,"goods, he could not be penalized. I f we",39
NA,"are to keep faith with the people, we must",39
NA,do all that is possible to protect the con-,39
NA,sumers.,39
Mr ANSTEY ,Bourke) [2.58] -I t,39
NA,would be improper for me to make a,39
NA,second-reading speech now; but I would,39
NA,point out that everything that I said on,39
NA,the second reading has been justified by,39
NA,the Ministerial attitude towards those,39
NA,who have suggested amendments in this,39
NA,clause. I said that the Government did,39
NA,"not intend to do anything, and its con-",39
NA,duct to-day shows that the Bill; and this,39
NA,"clause of the Bill, are merely so much",39
NA,camouflage and deception. The Bill does,39
NA,"not provide for anything being done, and",39
NA,"the clause, of course, makes no provision",39
NA,for any exercise of power. The honorable,40
NA,member for Ballarat ( Mr MCGrath),40
NA,has moved an amendment providing for,40
NA,an inquiry into certain facts. I t may be,40
NA,that we have no power to do anything;,40
NA,but there is no reason why there should,40
NA,"not be an investigation, or why publicity",40
NA,sliould not be given to the results of it.,40
NA,I cannot see any objection to that.,40
NA,I f time has been unduly occupied in the,40
NA,discussion of the amendment the fault,40
NA,"rests with the Government, since it re-",40
NA,fuses to agree to a simple prgposal that,40
NA,the Tariff Board shall be empowered to,40
NA,investigate ordinary questions of trade.,40
NA,The honorable member for Ballarat ( Mr.,40
NA,MCGrath) says that there are certain,40
NA,manufacturers who for a variety of rea-,40
NA,sons will not sell direct to the retail,40
NA,dealer. There arc many typical cases.,40
NA,"For instance, a storekeeper in Castle-",40
NA,maine may desire to purchase blankets,40
NA,"from the iocal manufactory, but he can-",40
NA,not do so. The blankets made in that,40
NA,factory are sent to warehousemen in,40
NA,"Flindefs-laue, so that the local dealer has",40
NA,"to pay Melbourne ""blood"" money plus",40
NA,the cost of. returning those blankets to the,40
NA,"town where they are manufactured, and",40
NA,where he proposes to sell them. I n Sale,40
NA,and Bairnsdale there are large store-,40
NA,keepers who are prepared to buy direct,40
NA,from many of the big manufactories in,40
NA,"this country. I n no case, hewever, are",40
NA,they able to do so. The storekeepers,40
NA,"must pay- "" blood "" money to the selling",40
NA,agencies in Flinders-lane. The Govern-,40
NA,ment object to any inquiry into these,40
NA,matters. They object to the public,40
NA,knowing the extent to which this practice,40
NA,is being carried on. They refuse to per-,40
NA,mit any investigation upon the ground,40
NA,"that, even when such an investigaion had",40
NA,"been made by the Board, they would have",40
NA,no power to do anything. There is no,40
NA,"reason why in the public interest, how-",40
NA,"ever, such matters should not be investi-",40
NA,gated and f u l l publicity given to the,40
NA,findings of the Board. ' I believe that,40
NA,the Government have power to deal with,40
NA,all such cases. They are preparedto,40
NA,permit inquiry into the prices charged by,40
NA,manufacturers who directly exploit the,40
NA,"public, because they say they can deal",40
NA,with them per medium of the' Tariff. I t,40
NA,"is well known, however, that in very",40
NA,many cases the main instrument of ex-,40
NA,ploitation is the selling agency associated,40
NA,10173,40
NA,with a manufactory. I f the Government,40
NA,take up the attitude that they are power-,40
NA,"less to deal with such practices, then I say",40
NA,"that the Bill is a delusion, a sham, and",40
NA,"a mockery. I t is a sort of ""rich uncle",40
NA,"from F i j i "" piece of legislation. There",40
NA,are some big manufactories in this coun-,40
NA,try which purport to sell direct to the,40
NA,public. Their goods are produced in one,40
NA,"part of the building occupied by them,",40
NA,and in another part of the same building,40
NA,very often there is a selling agency car-,40
NA,"ried on under a different name, although",40
NA,its directors and shareholders are the,40
NA,directors and shareholders of the manu-,40
NA,facturing company. The company sells,40
NA,its products to the selling agency at a,40
NA,"profit of 5 per cent., and that distributing",40
NA,agency in turn sells to the retailers at,40
NA,rates that insure enormous profits. The,40
NA,profits are then divided between them.,40
NA,"I n other cases, as,'for instance, in the boot",40
NA,"industry, there are manufacturers who",40
NA,"have their own retail shops, and make",40
NA,"their profits, not in the factory, but in",40
NA,the retail trade. They may make a loss,40
NA,"in the actual work of production, but",40
NA,they make big profits through their retail,40
NA,agencies. The Government say that,40
NA,they can do nothing so far as tbese sell-,40
NA,ing agencies are concerned. I f that is,40
NA,"so, then they might as well put the Bill",40
NA,"into the waste-paper basket, because there",40
NA,is not an exploiting manufacturer in Aus-,40
NA,tralia who cannot evade the provisions of,40
NA,the Bill as it stands by the simple method,40
NA,of establishing a distributing agency to,40
NA,"which he will sell at a reasonable price,",40
NA,leaving the selling agency to make the re-,40
NA,quisite profits. This attitude on the,40
NA,part of the Government shows that the,40
NA,Bill is a mere piece of camouflage. The,40
NA,Government propose by it to establish a,40
NA,Board and create a staff at a cost of,40
NA,thousands of pouuds in order to permit,40
NA,of inquiries that will not touch the sell-,40
NA,"ing agents, and can be absolutely of no",40
NA,advantage to the general public. Some,40
NA,one has said that there are some manufac-,40
NA,turers who are prepared to sell at reason-,40
NA,"able rates. ""We know that there are cer-",40
NA,tain manufacturers who are prepared to,40
NA,break away from rings and deal fairly,40
NA,by the general public. But they are,40
NA,bound hand and foot by the limitations,40
NA,that the rings can impose-b y the boy-,40
NA,cott which these rings can bring tn bear,40
NA,upon them. Yet the Government would,40
NA,"say to sucb. manufacturers, "" We will take",41
NA,away from you tbe protection wbicb the,41
NA,"Tariff affords."" I t is absurd to say tbat",41
NA,the Government can deal with those who,41
NA,are exploiting the public only by taking,41
NA,away the protective duties and so penal-,41
NA,izing the innocent as well as the guilty.,41
NA,When the Government take up that stand,41
NA,they show they do not want to do any-,41
NA,thing. I am not speaking as a partisan,41
NA,or in condemnation of the present Go-,41
NA,vernment alone. I have made the same,41
NA,complaint regarding a Government be-,41
NA,"hind which I have sat. Years ago,",41
NA,when I was supporting a certain Govern-,41
NA,ment .that was proposing to appeal to,41
NA,the people to agree to certain amend-,41
NA,"ments of the Constitution, a doubt was",41
NA,first raised i n my mind as to our consti-,41
NA,tutional powers being as limited as they,41
NA,"were said to be, by hearing the present",41
NA,Acting Prime Minister ( Sir Joseph,41
NA,"Cook) and Sir William Irvine, who were",41
NA,"then in Opposition, constantly reiterating",41
NA,the statement that the Government could,41
NA,do whatever they wanted to do i f they,41
NA,chose to exercise their existing powers.,41
NA,I t was such statements that roused i n me,41
NA,"the spirit of investigation. _ Mr Glynn,",41
NA,"who was then the representative of Angas,",41
NA,also claimed that the Government could,41
NA,do whatever it desired to do in the way,41
NA,of protecting the people from exploita-,41
NA,"tion. There never was a Government,",41
NA,no matter how limited its constitutional,41
NA,"power, that could not do what i t wanted",41
NA,to do. What a Government may not do,41
NA,by direct legislation it may yet achieve,41
NA,through its various instrumentalities.,41
NA,The Government have unlimited power to,41
NA,"license, and can impose licensing condi-",41
NA,tions. They can use the instrumentali-,41
NA,ties of Government to prevent exploita-,41
NA,tion just as they have used them against,41
NA,Tattersall's. Any institution or enter-,41
NA,prise which is conducted to the detriment,41
NA,of the public can be dealt with effectively,41
NA,through the instrumentalities of Govern-,41
NA,"ment. I t can be deprived of postal,",41
NA,"telegraphic, and telephonic facilities of",41
NA,communication.,41
Mr BELL ,Bu t all that has not been,41
NA,very successful so far as Tattersall's are,41
NA,concerned.,41
Mr ANSTEY ,Tattersall' s depends,41
NA,chiefly upon the receipt and delivery of,41
NA,"letters sent through the post, or small",41
NA,parcels that can be sent through agencies.,41
NA,Large commodities cannot be dealt with,41
NA,in that way. The Government cannot,41
NA,deal with a case of butter as they can,41
NA,with letters addressed to Tattersall's; but,41
NA,they can control the instrumentalities of,41
NA,"transport, and in that way deal effectively",41
NA,with every great industry that is being,41
NA,carried on in a way that is detrimental,41
NA,to the public interest. The Government,41
NA,can go further. They can create a pub-,41
NA,lic opinion and expose exploiters to pub-,41
NA,lic odium. There was never a Govern-,41
NA,ment that could not devise a means of,41
NA,doing what i t wanted to do. There was,41
NA,never a Government that could not make,41
NA,an individual bend to its will.,41
Mr STEWART ,An d never a Govern--,41
NA,ment that could not find an excuse for,41
NA,refraining from doing what it did not,41
NA,want to do.,41
Mr ANSTEY ,Tha t is so. This is,41
NA,not the only Government that has shown,41
NA,a desire to shirk its obligations. Any,41
NA,Government that wants to do so is always,41
NA,ready with excuses. While I have been,41
NA,in this Parliament I have known Govern-,41
NA,ments to declare that they had not the,41
NA,power to do something which a year or,41
NA,two later they actually did.,41
NA,"The Bill as i t stands is a sham,- a",41
NA,"fraud, a delusion, and a mockery. I t pro-",41
NA,vides merely for the expenditure of large,41
NA,sums of public money in making inquiries,41
NA,in respect of which no further action is,41
NA,to he taken. Many honorable members,41
NA,voted for high duties on the understand 1,41
NA,ing that the Government would bring in,41
NA,a Bill that would protect the consuming,41
NA,public from the rapacity o'f certain men,41
NA,"who abuse the protection given them, and",41
NA,now that the Bill is introduced we have,41
NA,absolutely clear evidence that the Govern-,41
NA,ment does not intend to do anything in,41
NA,that direction.,41
Mr BELL ,Darwin) [3.11] -Earlie r,41
NA,"in the day I pointed out that, in my",41
NA,"opinion, it was necessary to have in the",41
NA,Bil l a provision that would do exactly,41
NA,what the amendment moved by the hon-,41
NA,orable member for Ballarat ( Mr.,41
NA,"MCGrath) is designed to dp, but the Acting",41
NA,Attorney-General ( Mr Groom) inti-,41
NA,mated that we had not the constitutional,41
NA,power to legislate in that direction. Since,41
NA,"two or three days had already, been de-",41
NA,voted to the discussion bf the constitu-,41
NA,"tional aspect of this question, I said I",41
NA,"would not debate it, but the Govern-",41
NA,ment have not satisfied me that there is,41
NA,"no power to give effect to this amendment,",42
NA,and I do not think any harm will he done,42
NA,"by making it. After all, i t will only",42
NA,mean tliat where a manufacturer refuses,42
NA,to sell to people in the trade who desire,42
NA,to buy directly from him inquiry may be,42
NA,made into all the circumstances.,42
NA,only argument I have heard against the,42
NA,amendment is that where certain manu-,42
NA,facturers are not in a position to supply,42
NA,direct to those who may desire to deal,42
NA,with them such a provision as this might,42
NA,"operate harshly. After all, we are not",42
NA,going to judge to-day whether the whole,42
NA,of the manufacturers i n any particular,42
NA,industry are in a position to do what we,42
NA,"desire. The Board"" will inquire and re-",42
NA,"port to this Parliament, and the final de-",42

NA,by Statute. Some doubt was raised con-,42
NA,cerning whether the wording of the,42
NA,"clause, as it now reads, would not per-",42
NA,"mit the Minister, upon a report of the",42
NA,"Board, to do things which are not now",42
NA,legal for him to do. .,42
Mr BELL ,Darwin) [3.21] - I am,42
NA,not satisfied that the amendment will,42
NA,bring about what I desire. I want to,42
NA,insure that when the Board makes a re-,42
NA,port it will be brought before Parliament.,42
NA,I think that can be brought about by,42
NA,making sub-clause 1 read-,42
NA,Upon receipt of a report fromthe Board,42
NA,"in pursuance of thc last preceding section, the",42
NA,Minister shall ask Parliament to take action,42
NA,in respect of any of the matters dealt w i t h by,42
NA,..22 the Board in its report.,42
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Richmond-Ministe r for,42
NA,Trade and Customs) [3.22] -I f the,42
NA,".. 1 clause were so amended, the procedure",42
NA,' AYES.,42
NA,would fee rendered unworkable. The,42
NA,Board must report inregard to quite a,42
NA,"number of things; for example, concern-",42
NA,ing the matters dealt with in the preced-,42
NA,ing section. I f the Minister had to bring,42
NA,everything before Parliament before he,42
NA,"co.uld move, and had to get the House to",42
NA,"agree, he would be invoking Parliament",42
NA,every day. With respect to certain,42
NA,"things, such as increasing or decreasing",42
NA,"duties, the Minister may not act without",42
NA,NOES. .,42
NA,the consent of Parliament; but to ask,42
NA,Parliament to decide upon everything-,42
NA,"such, for example, as the determination",42
NA,of the'value of goods for duty under sec-,42
NA,tion 160 of the Customs Act-woul d be,42
NA,1 looking for altogether too much.,42
Mr BELL , I desired to be assured,42
NA,"that, in regard to the variation of duties,",42
NA,the Minister would not ibe able to take,42
NA,action independently. I - am satisfied,42
NA,with his explanation.,42
NA,'Amendment agreed to. i,42
NA,"Clause, as amended, agreed te.",42
NA,Clause 16 agreed to.,42
NA,Clause 17 (Annual report).,42
Mr GREGORY ,Dampier) [3.26] - I,42
NA,desire to enter my objection to the con-,42
NA,"cluding portion of sub-clause 1, which",42
NA,"states that the Board, in its annual re-",43
NA,"port, shall-",43
NA,set out the recommendations made by the,43
NA,"Board during thc preceding twelve months,",43
NA,other than any recommendations whose inclu-,43
NA,sion the Minister and the Board agree is not,43
NA,in the public interest.,43
NA,Every recommendation of the Board,43
NA,should ' be submitted to Parliament.,43
NA,There should be no secrets. The recom-,43
NA,mendations should be the property of,43
NA,"Parliament. Of course, the objection of",43
NA,"the Minister has been that, i f it is pro-",43
NA,posed to introduce a schedule for the,43
NA,"alteration of certain Tariff rates, traders",43
NA,might learn the proposals of the Govern-,43
NA,"ment beforehand. But, since the reports",43
NA,of the Board would come before the Min-,43
NA,"ister, and, through him, to the Executive",43
NA,"Council, there should be ample time for",43
NA,the Government to consider what action,43
NA,"to take, and then to simultaneously intro-",43
NA,duce the schedule aud produce the report',43
NA,of the Board.,43
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Richmond-Ministe r for,43
NA,Trade and Customs) [3.2S] -Accordin g,43
NA,"to this clause, upon a certain date the",43
NA,Tariff Board must compile its annual re-,43
NA,port for Parliament. During the last,43
NA,"week of the year , the Board might agree",43
NA,to make certain recommendations to the,43
NA,Minister in regard to the increase or re-,43
NA,duction of duties. I t is essential that,43
NA,such matters be kept absolutely secret,43
NA,until the moment when it becomes neces-,43
NA,sary to take action in Parliament. The,43
NA,Board must be in agreement with the,43
NA,"Minister; and, i f thc two authorities are",43
NA,agreed that it is in the public interest,43
NA,"that a recommendation be withheld, then",43
NA,it is only right that provision should be,43
NA,made to that end.,43
NA,Clause agreed to.,43
NA,Clauses 18 to 35 agreed to.,43
NA,Amendment (by Mr GREENE) agreed,43
NA,to-,43
NA,That the following new clause be inserted,43
NA,after clause (1):-,43
NA,This Act sliall commence on a date,43
NA,fixed by proclamation.,43
NA,Title agreed to.,43
NA,Bill reported with amendments.,43
NA,"Standing Orders suspended, aud report",43
NA,adopted.,43
NA,THIBD READING.,43
NA,Motion (by Mr MASSYGREENE) proposed-,43
NA,That this Bill be now read a third time.,43
Mr GREGORY ,Dampier) [3.33] -,43
NA,I t is my intention to oppose the third,43
NA,reading of the Bill. I was very inter-,43
NA,ested to read in this week's Industrial,43
NA,"Australian and Mining Standard, which",43
NA,has been a great champion of the High,43
NA,"Tariffists, a paragraph which, in pointing",43
NA,out the advantages which will accrue,43
NA,"from the proposed Board, states that",43
NA,Parliament in building up the new Tariff,43
NA,has been working wholly in the dark. I t,43
NA,is one of .the most amusing statements'I,43
NA,have ever read. I n championing the,43
NA,proposed Board this journal shows clearly,43
NA,that this and previous Parliaments have,43
NA,been imposing duties without .the slightest,43
NA,knowledge of what the effect of them,43
NA,would be. Now that the Tariff has been,43
NA,dealt with we can surely defer this pro-,43
NA,"posal for some time, and endeavour .to",43
NA,save a little money. I do not know that,43
NA,"the Board will be particularly useful, al-",43
NA,though i f the Minister appoints a good,43
NA,Board it may be of some value. I prefer,43
NA,"no Board, but i f we are to have one I",43
NA,desire one responsible to Parliament,43
NA,rather than to the Minister. This Bill,43
NA,merely provides for the appointment of,43
NA,"a Ministerial Board - Therefore, I ask",43
NA,the House to reject the third reading.,43
Mr FRANCIS ,"Henty) [3.35] -I ,",43
NA,"too, shall oppose the third reading, be-",43
NA,cause I consider it unnecessary to build,43
NA,up a new and expensive Department,43
NA,which will add to the waste of thousands,43
NA,of pounds which the people have now to,43
NA,bear. The tendency of the people to-,43
NA,day is to prevent the building up of new,43
NA,Departments instead of increasing them;,43
NA,as we seem to be doing almost every day.,43
NA,"The Board, constituted as it will be, will",43
NA,have no effect as far as I can see beyond,43
NA,providing cosy billets for some of those,43
NA,who are now seeking employment.,43
Mr BELL ,Darwin) [3.37] -Th e,43
NA,principal debate on this Bill was con-,43
NA,"centrated on clause 14, because of the",43
NA,difference of opinion amongst members,43
NA,to be as to the effectiveness of the provisions,43
NA,for preventing unfair dealing on the part,43
NA,"of manufacturers, but as to the purpose",43
NA,"of the Bill as a whole, I am hopeful",43
NA,"that the Board will prove beneficial,'",43
NA,and be the means of saviug the Com-,43
NA,monwealth hundreds of thousands of,43
NA,pounds per annum. I n the Tariff which,43
NA,we have .just .passed there are .some,43
NA,"anomalies, ancl it will be tbe duty of tbe",44
NA,Board to inquire into and report upon,44
NA,"tbe duties wbicb we have imposed, some",44
NA,-of which may be found insufficient and -,44
NA,"ineffective, and others far too high, aud",44
NA,detrimental to other industries. For that,44
NA,"reason particularly I shall support ""the",44
NA,Bill. Like other honorable members I,44
NA,am hopeful that the Board will be effec-,44
NA,tive in eliminating the unfair dealing of ',44
NA,manufacturers who are amply protected,44
NA,with the consumers. The Board will bo,44
NA,"a useful body, I believe, and the cost will",44
NA,"""not be so great but that it will be amply",44
NA,repaid by the work the Board may be,44
NA,able to do within even the current finan-,44
NA,cial year.,44
Mr ATKINSON ,Wilmot) [3.40] - I,44
NA,have not had a chance of discussing the,44
NA,B i l l in Committee. On the' second,44
NA,reading I said that I was not enamoured,44
NA,"of the Board, but if it, was properly con-",44
NA,stituted and worked in the right way it,44
NA,might be capable of doing great good to,44
NA,"the people. I n dealing with the Tariff,",44
NA,which involves so much to consumers and,44
NA,the people engaged in industry and com-,44
NA,"merce, there is big scope for useful work.",44
NA,When the Tariff was first explained to,44
NA,Parliament by the Minister we were told,44
NA,"that this Board was to be created, and a",44
NA,great number of the duties were passed,44
NA,with that in mind. Therefore^ we would,44
NA,be stultifying ourselves if we rejected the,44
NA,Bill now. I believe there is a good,44
NA,chance of the Board working economic-,44
NA,"ally, and at the same time conferring",44
NA,considerable benefits upon the community.,44
NA,I f the working of the Board shows that,44
NA,it is not an effective instrument i t need,44
NA,not be continued for any length of time.,44
NA,"I t is not, like the "" Old Man of the Sea,""",44
NA,hung about our necks for ever. One,44
NA,feature that appeals to me is that Par-,44
NA,liament may be able to act quickly while,44
NA,the conditions reported upon by the,44
NA,Board still obtain. Having the recom-,44
NA,mendations of the Board before it a body,44
NA,like Parliament ought to be able to say,44
NA,promptly what is the fair thing to do,44
NA,in the circumstances. Having supported,44
NA,"the second reading of the Bill, I feel that",44
NA,I am only consistent in voting for the,44
NA,third reading.,44
Dr EARLE PAGE ,Cowper) [3.44] -,44
NA,I enter my protest against the passing of,44
NA,this Bill at this present time. The Min-,44
NA,ister would be well advised to withdraw,44
NA,"it, and reintroduce i t on a subsequent",44
NA,occasion. Less than a fortnight has,44
NA,"elapsed since it was first introduced, and",44
NA,the minds of commercial men throughout,44
NA,the Commonwealth have not had time to,44
NA,concentrate upon i t and formulate con-,44
NA,crete opinions. I hope that even yet,44
NA,another place will see fit to take such,44
NA,action as will enable this House to have,44
NA,a further opportunity of reconsidering,44
NA,the whole question.,44

NA,"October, when we shall have a little more finish?",45
NA,knowledge of what the effects of the,45
NA,Tariff may be?,45
Sir JOSEPH COOK,Th e honorable am,45

Mr GREGORY ,W e are following your,45
NA,previous speeches.,45
Sir JOSEPH COOK ,A s I remarked,45
NA,"the other day, tbe honorable member",45
NA,"getting old, and is ""looking",45

NA,to ask the House for two months' Supply.,45
Mr WATT ,O n the same day?,45
Sir JOSEPH COOK ," I do not know;,",45
NA,but i t seems at the moment as though,45
NA,should take up the whole of Tuesday on arc introducing.,45
NA,the preliminary stage of the Bill I have,45

NA,"Minister, for Works and Railways ( Mr.",45

NA,whole of Tuesday is not taken up by,45

NA,"to the War Service Homes, my impreswas",45
NA,sion is that the matter might very well,45
NA,be discussed on Supply.,45
Mr WATT ,S o long as that,45
NA,contract the Assistant Minister for Re-,45
NA,patriation made with the House.,45
Sir JOSEPH COOK , I take i t that,45
NA,it does. The honorable gentleman proI,45
NA,"mised, and is ready, to make a full",45
NA,"ment, and the sooner i t is made the",45
NA,-better.,45
Mr RYAN ,Wha t the Minister said,45
NA,"was that he would make a statement, and",45
NA,- move that a paper be printed.,45
Mr RODGERS ,Tha t is so; but Supply,45
NA,affords the same opportunity for debat-,45
NA,ing the statement as would a motion that,45
Mr RYAN ,Excep t that a motion is,45
NA,which do him open to amendment.,45
Sir JOSEPH COOK , I do not see,45

NA,"or on a specific motion; and, under. the",45
NA,"I circumstances, I think it would be better-",45

NA,"(vide page 59), on motion by Mr.",9
NA,CURTIN-,9
NA,That the Government is deserving of censure,9
NA,for-,9
NA,(a) Failing to take action to safeguard,9
NA,Australia's oversea funds by check-,9
NA,ing the increasing flow of unneces-,9
NA,"sary imports, thus leaving it to the",9
NA,Commonwealth Bank Board exclu-,9
NA,sively to direct national monetary,9
NA,-policy in a manner gravely affecting,9
NA,&he economic conditions of Australia.,9
NA,(6) Disclaiming all responsibility for tho,9
NA,"course now taken, wliich .prejudices",9
NA,the employment of the people and,9
NA,increases ihe difficirl-bies of trade,9
NA,and commerce generally.,9
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,Barker),9
NA,[2.30] - I do not know whether or not,9
NA,the action of the Opposition i n bringing,9
NA,forward this motion of censure was due,9
NA,to a misreading of scripture. I would,9
NA,"point out to them, however, that when the",9
NA,prodigal son returned to his father a calf,9
NA,was slaughtered to celebrate his home-,9
NA,"coming. The attempt on this occasion,",9
NA,"apparently, is to slaughter a lion. Pos-",10
NA,sibly honorable members opposite are,10
NA,hunting the more ferocious animal oil,10
NA,account of the fact that eight prodigals,10
NA,have returned to their father.,10
NA,The Opposition could have launched,10
NA,Beveral motions that might have caused,10
NA,"the Goverument some embarrassment, or",10
NA,"if not the Government, at all events some",10
NA,"of its supporters. Por example, had it",10
NA,been proposed to censure the Government,10
NA,for failure to restore -within Australia,10
NA,the system of compulsory military train-,10
NA,"ing, which is necessary for the defence of",10
NA,"this country, and is one of the outstand-",10
NA,ing planks in the platform of the Labour,10
NA,"party, I , and probably quite a number of",10
NA,"other honorable members on this side,",10
NA,"whether wo liked it or not, on account",10
NA,"of our principles, would have been obliged",10
NA,to cross the floor and assist in the defeat,10
NA,of tho Government. That matter must,10
NA,be discussed before very long. All tho,10
NA,talk about brighter uniforms will not,10
NA,overcome the difficulty with which we are,10
NA,faced. I shall not at this stage debate,10
NA,"the matter further than to suggest that,",10
NA,if certain statements which have appeared,10
NA,in the press lately are to be regarded,10
NA,"seriously, I shall expect an order to be",10
NA,issued recalling the existing army 'boots,10
NA,and replacing them with dancing shoes.,10
NA,-,10
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL , I t would,10
NA,be a silly thing of that sort which the,10
NA,honorable member would think of.,10
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,The'nex t,10
NA,point with which I wish to deal is the,10
NA,very definite expression by the Opposition,10
NA,of what amounts to a lack of confidence,10
NA,in the Commonwealth Bank Board. My,10
NA,personal view is that the Government,10
NA,should test the feeling of the House on,10
NA,this matter. I t should move an amend-,10
NA,ment to the motion designed to discover,10
NA,whether honorable members opposite are,10
NA,prepared to state by their votes whether,10
NA,they have or have not confidence in the,10
NA,management of the financial situation by,10
NA,the Commonwealth Bank Board.,10
NA,believe that that would place some of my,10
NA,friends opposite in a somewhat awkward,10
NA,position. They are the political repre-,10
NA,sentatives of quite a body of people,10
NA,who are part owners of savings bank,10
NA,"deposits, amounting to £130,000,000,",10
NA,which have been entrusted to the care,10
NA,the directors of the Commonwealth Bank.,10
NA,Yesterday's debate left well in the air,10
NA,the position in regard to the board.,10
NA,The motion of censure consists of a con-,10
NA,"catenation of suggestions, conjectures,",10
NA,suppositions and prophecies. Time after,10
NA,time those occurred throughout the speech,10
NA,of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr.,10
NA,Curtin). I would recall to honorable,10
NA,members certain prophecies made during,10
NA,the last period of this session. Night,10
NA,"after night, on the motion for the ad-",10
NA,"journment of this chamber, honorable",10
NA,gentlemen on the left of the Chair rose,10
NA,in their places and announced that a,10
NA,terrific war would be on our doorstep,10
NA,before the House next met. That state,10
NA,"of affairs., however, to which apparently",10
NA,"they looked forward with some gusto,",10
NA,has fortunately not yet materialized. I,10
NA,trust that honorable members opposite,10
NA,will ho just as much astray in their,10
NA,prognostications with respect to the trade,10
NA,position.,10
NA,This is not the first occasion upon,10
NA,which I have heard a similar motion,10
NA,debated in this House. The last onslaught,10
NA,was led by our friend from Capricornia,10
NA,NA,10
NA,there is little difference between what,10
NA,was said about twelve months ago and,10
NA,what was said on this motion by the,10
NA,"Leader of the Opposition. To my mind,",10
NA,the attitude of the Labour party is in-,10
NA,"explicable. We find that party, whioh",10
NA,prides itself on representing the under-,10
NA,dog and on taking up the cudgels against,10
NA,"the great vested interests, criticizing the",10
NA,action of the Commonwealth Bank Board,10
NA,in making available to the general invest-,10
NA,"ing public £1,000,000 worth of treasury-",10
NA,bills on the same terms and. conditions,10
NA,as were enjoyed as a monopoly for some,10
NA,years hy the private hanking institutions,10
NA,of Australia. The situation is most,10
NA,"interesting, and we are entitled to a clear",10
NA,pronouncement of policy upon it hy,10
NA,lionorable members of the Opposition.,10
NA,They are not in the happy position of,10
NA,I being able to censure the Government,10
NA,unless they can advance a fairly concrete,10
NA,proposal.,10
NA,The House listened last night to quite,10
NA,a disquisition in regard to experiments,10
NA,and the increased rate of interest. This,10
NA,Government cannot he charged with,10
NA,of having freely indulged in experimental,10
NA,"legislation. Hitherto, that has been the",10
NA,particular monopoly of our friends oppo-,11
NA,site. Tlie Labour party lias .been a reser-,11
NA,voir from which has flowed stream after,11
NA,"stream of experimental legislation, most",11
NA,of which has ended in the marsh to,11
NA,which Robert Burns consigned the whole,11
NA,of the Stuart family. I f honorable,11
NA,members opposite had the power to work,11
NA,"their will with the Commonwealth Bank,",11
NA,along the lines advocated last night by,11
NA,the honorable member for Griffith ( Mr.,11
NA,"Baker), I am afraid that that institution",11
NA,would find itself in such a marsh. The,11
NA,concern for interest rates is not the,11
NA,special monopoly of the Opposition.,11
NA,I t is the concern of every member of the,11
NA,House who represent electorates in which,11
NA,primary and secondary industries are,11
NA,conducted. Let us consider for a moment,11
NA,the history of the Opposition when it was,11
NA,in power. To which party belonged the,11
NA,Ministry that first went on the New York,11
NA,"loan market, and paid the highest rate",11
NA,of interest ever required of an Aus-,11
NA,tralian government? That Ministry,11
NA,was not constituted from this side of the,11
NA,House. I n all my political experience I,11
NA,have heard only one Labour man-an d he,11
NA,was well kicked for his pains-advocat e a,11
NA,reduction of the rate of interest before it,11
NA,was brought about some years ago. I,11
NA,refer to the Honorable Thomas Butter-,11
NA,"field. When he came out into the open, he",11
NA,said that the rates then being charged,11
NA,"could not be maintained, as they were no",11
NA,"longer the true rates, because the bor-",11
NA,rowers were paying an insurance against,11
NA,risk. He contended that the risk of lend-,11
NA,ing money was so great that the lender,11
NA,was asking for something in addition to,11
NA,the real rate in order to insure himself,11
NA,against tbe risk taken. On that occasion,11
NA,Mr Butterfield was taken seriously to,11
NA,task by men who were considered to be,11
NA,financial experts in the party of which he,11
NA,was rather a distinguished member.,11
NA,Let us consider the interest rates that,11
NA,have been charged during the last few,11
NA,"years, and let us view the matter from",11
NA,the broad aspect. I am not at all satis-,11
NA,fied that the rates of interest that have,11
NA,prevailed in recent years are the proper,11
NA,ones. Certain important factors were,11
NA,brought into calculation in fixing the,11
NA,"rates, and one was the fact that the lender",11
NA,-fo r instance the holder of Government,11
NA,bonds when the Premiers plan was,11
NA,instituted in 1931-wa s so chary about,11
NA,being able to secure his capital that he,11
NA,was prepared to accept a big reduction,11
NA,"of interest, i f he could see his principal",11
NA,safe. Another factor considered was that,11
NA,on account of the fall of prices it was no,11
NA,longer possible to make a profit by the,11
NA,investment of money in primary indus-,11
NA,"tries, or ordinary manufacturing and",11
NA,trading concerns. There was also extra,11
NA,heavy taxation on account of the general,11
NA,"depression. The whole of these factors,",11
NA,"and perhaps some others, were a contri-",11
NA,buting cause of the considerable reduc-,11
NA,"tion of the rate of interest, not because",11
NA,people thought that the rate would remain,11
NA,"down indefinitely, but because they had",11
NA,an immediate objective in view-th e,11
NA,safeguarding of their capital rather than,11
NA,"securing for a short time a doubtful,",11
NA,"though high, rate of interest.",11
NA,The Leader of tlie Opposition was good,11
NA,enough to suggest one or two directions,11
NA,in which he thought improvements might,11
NA,"be made. First, he said that something",11
NA,might be done by way of a bounty to,11
NA,assist sales overseas.,11
Mr CURTIN , I did not advocate those,11
NA,things.,11
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,Tha t is,11
NA,just the trouble. The honorable member,11
NA,did not advocate anything. He put for-,11
NA,ward a destructive argument of a weak,11
NA,"kind, but we could see his natural com-",11
NA,mon sense oozing through his contentions.,11
NA,This was noticeable in his references to,11
NA,bank deposits and economic anarchy.,11
NA,"One had no difficulty, however, i n recog-",11
NA,nizing the low tariffist. I n this Parlia-,11
NA,ment we witness the anomaly of the high,11
NA,"tariff party led by one who, so far as",11
NA,"my knowledge of him goes, is definitely a",11
NA,low-tariff man. That probably explains,11
NA,the interesting announcement in the COM-,11
NA,berra 'Times this week that the forth-,11
NA,coming tariff debate will be led from tho,11
NA,"Opposition side by its Deputy Leader, the",11
NA,lionorable member for Capricornia ( Mr.,11
NA,"Forde), instead of by its Leader ( Mr.",11
NA,Curtin).,11
Mr CURTIN ,"Th e honorable member,",11
NA,"too, is good at suppositions.",11
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON , I am,11
NA,dealing with a question that the honor-,11
NA,able gentleman must answer in this House,11
NA,before he is a month older. He' said,11
NA,something about bounties. I would not,11
NA,"accuse him or his party, under present",11
NA,"conditions, of being foolish enough to",12
NA,advocate anything. Not even the Opposi-,12
NA,tion desires a motion like that now before,12
NA,"the House to be carried, after the ex-",12
NA,perience in both the State and Federal,12
NA,spheres of Labour in power in bad times.,12
NA,Does the Opposition wish to split once,12
NA,more the party that was re-united last,12
NA,week? Every honorable member oppo-,12
NA,site knows that the last thing he desires,12
NA,is tbe responsibility of office in the,12
NA,monwealth sphere.,12
Mr BAKER ,W e thought that good,12
NA,times were back again.,12
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,W e have,12
NA,to admit that a decided improvement has,12
NA,occurred; but as the honorable member,12
NA,"for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker), and the",12
NA,honorable member for Flinders ( Mr.,12
NA,"Fairbairn) pointed out last night, the",12
NA,speech of the honorable member for Grif-,12
NA,fith ( Mr Baker) showed that there was,12
NA,serious misunderstanding on the part of,12
NA,the honorable member as to the actual,12
NA,position of the pastoral industry even in,12
NA,his own State. The honorable member,12
NA,seemed to overlook the fact that certain,12
NA,disabilities due to drought were still,12
NA,prevalent in Central and Western,12
NA,Queensland. These influences are also,12
NA,"felt in parts of New South Wales, a",12
NA,"section of Yictoria, and large portions of",12
NA,South Australia and Western Australia.,12
NA,Whilst a definite improvement in con-,12
NA,"ditions has taken place, due partly to the",12
NA,"increase of the prices of wool and wheat,",12
NA,no member on this side of the chamber,12
NA,is prepared to say that normal conditions,12
NA,have been restored. I f he were to make,12
NA,"such an assertion, I would not believe",12
NA,him.,12
NA,I shall now deal with the six points,12
NA,mentioned by the Leader of the Opposi-,12
NA,tion. The first was a bounty to assist,12
NA,sales. I f that became the policy of the,12
NA,"Opposition, taxation would have to be",12
NA,"maintained at its present high level, or",12
NA,"even increased, in order to provide the",12
NA,money necessary for the payment of the,12
NA,bounty. One complaint I have heard,12
NA,from the Opposition is that certain com-,12
NA,modities are sold here at a much greater,12
NA,price than is charged for them in foreign,12
NA,markets. I f the Opposition persisted in,12
NA,"that policy, i t would mean an extension",12
NA,of the system to which they object. The,12
NA,next point was that there should be tariff,12
NA,restrictions to reduce the stream of im-,12
NA,ports; but that is in direct contradic-,12
NA,tion to one of the most important state-,12
NA,ments in another part of the speech made,12
NA,"by the Leader of the Opposition, when",12
NA,he referred to economic anarchy due to,12
NA,tariff policy shutting out trade. A fur-,12
NA,ther point taken was the raising of an,12
NA,external loan but did the honorable,12
NA,gentleman seriously mean that tho,12
NA,ComLabour party would consider the raising,12
NA,of loans on an external market under,12
NA,"present conditions? I f so, I think that",12
NA,it would find such a proposal imprac-,12
NA,ticable. Next came a suggestion for the,12
NA,"rationing of exchange, without varying",12
NA,the rate. The honorable member him-,12
NA,self said that that would be unsuccess-,12
NA,"ful, so I need add nothing on that point.",12
NA,"As to the variation of the exchange rate,",12
NA,"from my point of view, and that of",12
NA,those whom I represent in this chambeT,12
NA,perhaps more closely than some other,12
NA,"honorable members, this would be a",12
NA,decided advantage. I f there were an in-,12
NA,"crease of the rate, it would immediately",12
NA,mean an increase of the prices of those,12
NA,exportable commodities which the pro-,12
NA,ducers have to sell; but coupled with,12
NA,that would be an increase of the internal,12
NA,price levels of those commodities which,12
NA,the working man on wages has to buy.,12
NA,Consequently I am a little dubious as to,12
NA,whether that course would be adopted,12
NA,by the Opposition i f they had the respon-,12
NA,sibility of making the decision.,12
NA,The next matter raised by the Leader,12
NA,of the Opposition was that of general,12
NA,"deflation, the establishment of a higher",12
NA,interest rate and the contraction of Aus-,12
NA,"tralian purchasing power, which i t is",12
NA,"contended, will, in essence, have practic-",12
NA,ally the same result as an increased rate,12
NA,of exchange. Tbe Opposition has had,12
NA,quite a lot to say about the increasing,12
NA,flow of imports. Let us examine what is,12
NA,"meant by the term "" trade"". I have",12
NA,always understood trade to mean an,12
NA,"exchange of goods for goods i f not directly,",12
NA,"at least, indirectly. But i f we are to",12
NA,take the statements of honorable members,12
NA,of the Opposition at what appears to be,12
NA,"their face value, their idea of trade is that",12
NA,we should go oh exporting and exporting,12
NA,but never receiving anything in exchange.,12
NA,"That sort of trade, i f i t can be so called,",12
NA,cannot continue for long. I t is obvious,12
NA,that i f we are to speed up our production,13
NA,and so become competitors in foreign,13
NA,"markets, as the Leader of the Opposition",13
NA,"mentioned yesterday, then we have to be",13
NA,prepared to accept goods from foreign,13
NA,purchasers in exchange for the goods,13
NA,which we send to them. That conception,13
NA,"of trade, however, does not fall in with",13
NA,the tariff policy of tbe Australian Labour,13
NA,party.,13
Mr CURTIN ,Bu t the mere exchange,13
NA,of goods for goods would not enable us,13
NA,to pay our external obligations.,13
NA,"Mr ARCHIE CAMERON"" -Austra -",13
NA,lia has a certain amount of external obli-,13
NA,"gations to meet, but I do not think that",13
NA,the honorable member seriously suggests,13
NA,that the Cabinet would not take cogniz-,13
NA,ance of the London reserve position,13
NA,although he made that charge. I am,13
NA,afraid he has not produced a bill that,13
NA,would stand inspection by a political,13
NA,"Auditor-General, at any rate, because the",13
NA,charges he makes are not accurate.,13
Mr BAKER ,I t is the honorable mem-,13
NA,ber's duty to prove that they are not,13
NA,accurate.,13
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,Whe n,13
NA,speaking last night the honorable member,13
NA,for Griffith ( Mr Baker) did not prove the,13
NA,accuracy of those charges. He certainly,13
NA,"spoke about ad hoc and propter hoc,",13
NA,which caused me to accuse him of,13
NA,being all hocks; but with all due respect,13
NA,to what the Prime Minister said yester-,13
NA,day about the modesty of the honorable,13
NA,"member, I suggest that the most distin-",13
NA,guishing feature about him is not his,13
NA,""" hocks "", but his ears.",13
Mr CORBETT ," Mr Speaker, I ask, is",13
NA,that a parliamentary expression?,13
Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. Gr. J. Bell) -,13
NA,The expression was certainly not parlia-,13
NA,mentary. Unfortunately it was occa-,13
NA,"sioned by an interjection, which I over-",13
NA,"looked, and which should not have been",13
NA,made. I hope that honorable members,13
NA,will not interject or make personal,13
NA,remarks.,13
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,Ther e is,13
NA,"such a thing as a law of interest which, I",13
NA,"am afraid, in the discussion of such things",13
NA,"as trade and interest rates, there is rather",13
NA,a tendency to overlook. I f there is a,13
NA,great demand for money in the com-,13
NA,"munity for certain products, whether",13
NA,"primary or secondary, and the industries",13
NA,"concerned show signs of revival, then",13
NA,there will be a growing demand for money,13
NA,from tbe banking institutions for invest-,13
NA,ment in those particular industries. That,13
NA,"demand, to my mind, is one of the factors",13
NA,"which, to-day are causing a slight increase",13
NA,of the rate of interest. This morning a,13
NA,number of honorable members viewed a,13
NA,picture dealing with the great motor,13
NA,"works at Woodville, South Australia.",13
NA,Two or three years ago very few men,13
NA,were employed in those works; to-day in,13
NA,two of those establishments there are over,13
NA,"7,000 men employed in the making of",13
NA,motor bodies. I t is obvious that i f there,13
NA,is an increased demand for motor bodies,13
NA,there must also be an increased demand,13
NA,for certain materials or goods which are,13
NA,"not manufactured i n this country, but",13
NA,which must be imported by the firms con-,13
NA,"corned, which in this instance, are Messrs.",13
NA,Holdens and Richards. The same thing,13
NA,"applies to public utilities, such as the lay-",13
NA,"ing of the telephone cable to Tasmania,",13
NA,which was recently completed by the Com-,13
NA,monwealth Government. For that par-,13
NA,ticular work the Commonwealth Govern-,13
NA,ment had to import the cable. Was i t,13
NA,"wrong in doing so, although i t must have",13
NA,reduced the balance of our London,13
NA,funds? A similar process goes on,13
NA,"throughout industry generally, this factor",13
NA,and others affecting our London reserve.,13
NA,The Leader of the Opposition dealt,13
NA,at some length with the matter of,13
NA,our London balance and how it is arrived,13
NA,at. I suggest that no team of statis-,13
NA,ticians has yet been born that can fore-,13
NA,cast accurately what the London balance,13
NA,"is going to be, say, in a month's time;",13
NA,this is mathematically impossible because,13
NA,of the many factors which enter into the,13
NA,matter. An alteration of the prices,13
NA,we obtain for our goods may not,13
NA,affect the London balance in our,13
NA,"favour at all. For instance, i f the",13
NA,alteration of price occurs after a com-,13
NA,modity has been bought in Australia by,13
NA,"an overseas merchant, it makes no",13
NA,difference to our London balance. That,13
NA,"balance is, however, affected by the",13
NA,amount of money which goes out of this,13
NA,country to pay the costs of travellers who,13
NA,"leave this country. Likewise, i t is",13
NA,affected by the amount of money trans-,13
NA,ferred to this country by visitors to Aus-,13
NA,tralia from overseas. Another factor,13
NA,"to be considered is the shipping rate, mo3t",13
NA,of whicli is payable to the United King-,14
NA,"dom, whilst a reduction of the rate of",14
NA,insurance is bound to affect the balance,14
NA,in London. These things cannot be fore-,14
NA,"cast. The prices of staple commodities,",14
NA,which are very largely responsible for the,14
NA,"maintenance of this balance, cannot be",14
NA,forecast with any degree of accuracy even,14
NA,"a day ahead, let alone a month ahead.",14
NA,"Thus, this is a subject which should be left",14
NA,entirely to the management of those who,14
NA,have had some experience in dealing with,14
NA,it ancl can speak with authority on it .,14
NA,Tbe suggestion was made last night,14
NA,that this chamber should be given the sole,14
NA,right of determining the policy of the,14
NA,Commonwealth Bank. I am absolutely,14
NA,"opposed to such a proposal, and in this",14
NA,respect I cannot do better than refer,14
NA,honorable members to the report of the,14
NA,royal commission which inquired into the,14
NA,affairs of the Agricultural Bank in West-,14
NA,ern Australia. One point made by that,14
NA,commission was that Ministers in Western,14
NA,Australia so interfered with the invest-,14
NA,"ments and activities of that bank, that",14
NA,to-day Western Australia is faced with a,14
NA,debt of some millions of pounds- a loss,14
NA,which has to be made good by the tax-,14
NA,payers. I understand that the interest,14
NA,bill on those losses amounts to something,14
NA,"like £640,000 a yetir. Another instance",14
NA,of political interference with banking,14
NA,policy is the notorious attempt of the,14
NA,Government of New South Wales to,14
NA,interfere in tlie business of the Savings,14
NA,"Bank of New South Wales, as a result of",14
NA,which many of the depositors in that bank,14
NA,were placed iu ; i very unfortunate posi-,14
NA,tion. Nothing iias been brought forward,14
NA,by the Opposition to show that the Go-,14
NA,vernment has failed in its duty in regard,14
NA,to the interest rate or the exchange rate,14
NA,or the offer of treasury-bills to the general the,14
NA,public. Honorable members on this side,14
NA,"of the chamber, especially those who",14
NA,represent producers who owe considerable,14
NA,"sums of money, would like to see the",14
NA,interest rate kept as low as possible.,14
Mr MAHONEY ,Th e producers cannot,14
NA,pay increased interest rates.,14
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,Wit h an,14
NA,increased demand for money and an,14
NA,"extension of secondary industries, there",14
NA,is bound to be a hardening of interest,14
NA,rates. The present rate of per,14
NA,for call money is not fixed; at any time,14
NA,it may either drop or rise. I t would be,14
NA,interesting to know what the Opposition,14
NA,would do i f it were on the treasury bench.,14
NA,Could it prevent the Bank of New South,14
NA,Wales from increasing the rate of interest,14
NA,on fixed deposits ?,14
Mr BEASLEY ,Doe s the honorable,14
NA,member think that the action of the bank,14
NA,was right?,14
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON , I do not,14
NA,know all the circumstances. No evidence,14
NA,has been presented to this House that,14
NA,the action of the Commonwealth Bank,14
NA,Board in making available in the open,14
NA,market treasury-bills to the value of,14
NA,"£1,000,000 was responsible for the",14
NA,increased rate of interest payable by the,14
NA,Bank of New South Wales on fixed,14
NA,deposits. Decisions of this nature are not,14
NA,made hurriedly. I do not know Mr.,14
NA,"Davidson, of the Bank of New South",14
NA,"Wales, other than by reputation, but he",14
NA,would be a very impetuous gentleman to,14
NA,control such an institution as the Bank,14
NA,"of New South Wales if, a few minutes",14
NA,after the Commonwealth Bank Board,14
NA,announced its decision to make treasury-,14
NA,"bills available to the public, he decided",14
NA,to increase the rate of interest payable,14
NA,by his bank on fixed deposits. The,14
NA,Opposition has no more knowledge of this,14
NA,question than has the ordinary private,14
NA,member on this side of the chamber. I t,14
NA,may be that the Government has more,14
NA,"information; but, i f so, it has kept that",14
NA,"information to itself. As I have said,",14
NA,decisions of this nature are not made,14
NA,"suddenly, but are the result of mature",14
NA,and deliberate consideration on the part,14
NA,of the directorates of the banks con-,14
NA,"cerned. I f we knew the facts, we should",14
NA,probably find that the Bank of New,14
NA,South Wales arrived at its decision before,14
NA,Commonwealth Bank Board,14
NA,announced its intention to place treasury-,14
NA,bills on the open market. At least Oppo-,14
NA,sition members are unable to produce any,14
NA,evidence to the contrary.,14
Mr GARDEN ,I t may be that there,14
NA,was a conspiracy to throw the blame on,14
NA,the Commonwealth Bank instead of on,14
NA,the private banH.,14
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON , I do not,14
NA,"know anything about conspiracies,",14
NA,because I was not brought up in the,14
NA,"cent, atmosphere in which they are hatched.",14
NA,The attitude of the Opposition reminds,14
NA,me of a story of the man who caused a,15
NA,"great deal of noise, 'but gathered very",15
NA,little wool when he attempted to shear,15
NA,the pig.,15
Mr WARD ,East Sydney) [3.4] -,15
NA,Not one speaker from the Government,15
NA,side of the chamber has answered the,15
NA,serious charge made by the Leader of,15
NA,"the Opposition ( Mr Curtin), that the",15
NA,functions of government have passed from,15
NA,this Parliament to an authority outside,15
NA,"Parliament. Moreover, differing state-",15
NA,ments as to what actually took place,15
NA,to the action of the Commonwealth Bank,15
NA,Board in making available treasury-bills,15
NA,in the open market have been given by,15
NA,the Prime Minister ( Mr Lyons) and the,15
NA,Treasurer ( Mr Casey). The Prime,15
NA,Minister did not tell the whole of the,15
NA,"facts to this House, probably because he",15
NA,was not in possession of them. I f that,15
NA,"be the situation, it is rather a peculiar",15
NA,position for a Prime Minister to occupy.,15
NA,The right honorable gentleman said that,15
NA,he was not aware of the action contem-,15
NA,plated by the Commonwealth Bank Board,15
NA,until the day before action was taken.,15
NA,He went on to say tbat it is not the duty,15
NA,of the Government to tender advice to,15
NA,the Commonwealth Bank unless that,15
NA,advice is sought. Not long after the,15
NA,lionorable gentleman took his seat the,15
NA,Treasurer told us that the Government,15
NA,had been in close consultation with the,15
NA,Commonwealth Bank Board throughout.,15
NA,I t would appear either that the Prime,15
NA,Minister had the information but was,15
NA,"not prepared to give it to this House, or",15
NA,"that he did not have it, and is, indeed,",15
NA,Prime Minister only in name. The,15
NA,"fact is that, instead of this being",15
NA,test between the Commonwealth Bank,15
NA,"and the private banks, the whole business",15
NA,has been most cunningly managed in,15
NA,order to make it appear that the Labour,15
NA,"party is inconsistent in that, although",15
NA,was responsible for the establishment of,15
NA,"the Commonwealth Bank, it now supports",15
NA,the private banks against that institu-,15
NA,"tion. That is not the position, because",15
NA,the Commonwealth Bank to-day is a,15
NA,vastly different institution from that,15
NA,which was established by the Labour,15
NA,party in 1911. To-day the Common-,15
NA,wealth Bank is merely a bulwark of the,15
NA,private banks. I am of the opinion that,15
NA,"the Commonwealth Bank Board, the",15
NA,heads of the private banks and their,15
NA,representatives in this Parliament have,15
NA,all along been in close collaboration. The,15
NA,honorable member for Barker ( Mr.,15
NA,Archie Cameron) referred to Mr David-,15
NA,"son, of the Bank of New South Wales,",15
NA,as an impetuous person.,15
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON , I said that he,15
NA,"would be an impetuous man i f , imme-",15
NA,diately the Commonwealth Bank decided,15
NA,"to put treasury-bills on the open market,",15
NA,he raised the rate of interest payable by,15
NA,prior his bank on fixed deposit.,15
Mr WARD ,Th e reason why the,15
NA,Bank of New South Wales acted so,15
NA,quickly was that the action taken by the,15
NA,Commonwealth Bank had the approval,15
NA,of the private banks: The Prime Minis-,15
NA,ter made no serious attempt to answer,15
NA,the charges of the Leader of the Opposi-,15
NA,tion. He said that the Commonwealth,15
NA,Bank had been charged with having pro-,15
NA,"tected the private banks, and he went on",15
NA,to say that it was more than a protector,15
NA,"of the private banks, for, in addition, it",15
NA,protected government savings banks and,15
NA,the savings of the people. Had the Com-,15
NA,monwealth Bank Board been keen to pro-,15
NA,"tect the savings of the people, it would",15
NA,have done so when the Government,15
NA,right Savings Bank of New South Wales was,15
NA,compelled to close its doors. Instead of,15
NA,"protecting the depositors, it allowed the",15
NA,money-lending fraternity to extort enor-,15
NA,"mous sums of money from them, when",15
NA,they were compelled to dispose of their,15
NA,deposits at reduced rates. The Prime,15
NA,Minister might have explained why the,15
NA,Commonwealth Bank Board failed to,15
NA,come to the assistance of the Government,15
NA,a conSavings Bank of New South Wales at a,15
NA,time when it was assisting private banks,15
NA,in Western Australia and Queensland.,15
NA,Honorable members opposite say that,15
NA,political control of the Commonwealth,15
NA,it Bank is undesirable. I f the government,15
NA,of the day does not. control the financial,15
NA,"policy of the country, it does not govern;",15
NA,and any government that is not govern-,15
NA,ing has no right to exist. Despite the,15
NA,"disclaimer of the Prime Minister, the",15
NA,Treasurer has admitted that the Govern-,15
NA,ment has in many instances influenced,15
NA,the decisions of the Commonwealth Bank,15
NA,"Board. Unfortunately, the real producers",15
NA,of the wealth of this country- I refer to,15
NA,the workers-ar e not represented on the,15
NA,Commonwealth Bank Board; that body,16
NA,is only representative of conflicting,16
NA,capitalistic influences. The true position,16
NA,was made clear last night by the honor-,16
NA,"able member for Griffith ( Mr Baker),",16
NA,when he exposed the activities and,16
NA,business connexions of the members,16
NA,of the board. The lionorable mem-,16
NA,ber showed clearly that the Com-,16
NA,monwealth Bank Board is represen-,16
NA,tative of interests diametrically opposed,16
NA,to those of the general community.,16
NA,"Even so, when these interests come into",16
NA,"conflict, and a difference of opinion as",16
NA,to the merits of a particular policy that,16
NA,should be followed exists among the mem-,16
NA,"bers of the Bank Board, the Common-",16
NA,wealth Government exercises an influence,16
NA,on some members of the Commonwealth,16
NA,Bank Board. The Treasurer admitted,16
NA,that for the last two years the,16
NA,Commonwealth Bank Board has been,16
NA,"in favour of an open bill market,",16
NA,and that it had been prevented from,16
NA,adopting that policy only by the fact,16
NA,"that, in the words of tbe Treasurer, "" the",16
NA,Loan Council stultified the efforts of the,16
NA,Commonwealth Bank Board for the last,16
NA,two years to establish an open bill,16
NA,"market"". I want to make it clear to",16
NA,those who have said that Labour mem-,16
NA,bers have advocated an open bill market,16
NA,that this action of the Commonwealth,16
NA,Bank Board has not resulted in the,16
NA,establishment of an open bill market. An,16
NA,open bill market is one in which the,16
NA,public may participate at competitive,16
NA,interest rates. Honorable members have,16
NA,spoken of the action of the board as a,16
NA,"rediscounting of £1,000,000 worth of",16
NA,treasury-bills which were made available,16
NA,"to the general public, as the Treasurer",16
NA,"himself said, "" as an experiment"".",16
NA,the minimum amount that any one indi-,16
NA,"vidual can take up is £10,000, how many",16
NA,members of the public will have an,16
NA,opportunity to secure any of these bills?,16
NA,Certainly not too many members of the,16
NA,public of any importance in my elec-,16
NA,torate will have an opportunity to apply,16
NA,for any of these treasury-bills. Common-,16
NA,"wealth treasury-bills, as has been said",16
NA,"some speakers, came into existence in",16
NA,1929 for the purpose of assisting the,16
NA,Commonwealth Bank and the private,16
NA,trading banks to finance government,16
NA,"deficits. When first introduced, the pre-",16
NA,Mr ^Yanl.,16
NA,vailing interest rate was 5J per cent.;,16
NA,"but by 1931, while the present Prime",16
NA,Minister was Treasurer of the Com-,16
NA,monwealth-an d I say this in answer,16
NA,to the honorable member for Barker,16
NA,"( Mr Archie Cameron), who said that the",16
NA,first man who ever spoke of lower interest,16
NA,rates was some member of the Labour,16
NA,party in South Australia-th e rate had,16
NA,been raised to 6 per cent. During the same,16
NA,year an important conference was held,16
NA,"at Canberra, attended by the then",16
NA,"Premier of New South Wales, Mr Lang.",16
NA,At that conference Mr Lang laid down,16
NA,"in definite and unequivocal terms, his",16
NA,j>roposals for affording relief in regard,16
NA,to interest rate3 to governments and,16
NA,other public bodies throughout Australia,16
NA,"Prom then onwards, interest rates began",16
NA,to tumble.,16
Mr THOMPSON ,I t was not because of,16
NA,Mr Lang.,16
Mr WARD ,I t may not have been,16
NA,due to any action taken legislatively by,16
NA,the then Premier of New South Wales,16
NA,"to reduce interest rates, although he did",16
NA,everything possible within his powers as,16
NA,State Premier to bring about that result.,16
NA,The reason why interest rates began to,16
NA,fall was that the Premier of New South,16
NA,Wales pointed out very plainly to people,16
NA,investing in Government securities that,16
NA,the Government had come to the end of,16
NA,its tether and that they had to be pre-,16
NA,pared to accept either lower interest rates,16
NA,or nothing at all. To-day treasury-bills,16
NA,are discounted at l f per cent.,16
NA,The Treasurer said that this proposal,16
NA,of the Commonwealth Bank Board,16
NA,was not of very great impor-,16
NA,"tance, that it was only an experi-",16
NA,"ment, and that the board was",16
NA,As only testing the open market. Very well;,16
NA,suppose it is satisfied with the results,16
NA,achieved. I f it is successful in disposing,16
NA,"of £1,000,000 worth of treasury-bills now",16
NA,"proposed, it is only logical to expect that",16
NA,it will proceed to unload the other trea-,16
NA,"sury-bills which i t holds, which I under-",16
NA,"stand amount to over £21,000,000. I f , as",16
NA,"the Treasurer says, this Government was",16
NA,by powerless to prevent the Commonwealth,16
NA,"Bank Board from issuing £1,000,000",16
NA,"worth of treasury-bills on the market, it",16
NA,would be equally powerless to prevent the,16
NA,"board from disposing of the £21,000,000",16
NA,worth of treasury-bills which i t holds,16
NA,to-day. I f that is done it will mean the,17
NA,withdrawal of moneys available for,17
NA,"special purposes, the restriction of credit,",17
NA,"an increase of the charges for overdrafts,",17
NA,"and eventually, for the general public and",17
NA,"the woi'kers of this country, worsened",17
NA,conditions and increased unemployment.,17
NA,"I f the issue of £1,000,000 worth of",17
NA,"treasury-bills is an experiment, probably",17
NA,tbe experiment is not in the direction,17
NA,"gested by the Treasurer, but because the",17
NA,Commonwealth Bank Board was not,17
NA,anxious to stampede people by placing,17
NA,the whole amount on the market at the,17
NA,one time. Probably the Com-,17
NA,monwealth Bank was heeding the,17
NA,advice given a few years ago,17
NA,by Mr Bruce in regard to unemploy-,17
NA,"ment, giving it to the people gradually.",17
NA,The whole policy of financing govern-,17
NA,ments by the issue of treasury-bills is,17
NA,nothing more than that inflation of cur-,17
NA,rency which I have heard honorable mem-,17
NA,bers opposite speak against so strongly,17
NA,on many occasions. That policy is wrong.,17
NA,I f the Commonwealth Bank were func-,17
NA,"tioning as a people's bank, the Govern-",17
NA,ment and the people should be able to,17
NA,receive all the accommodation they need,17
NA,at no greater cost than a mere charge to,17
NA,cover working expenses of the bank itself,17
NA,without its being necessary for the bank,17
NA,to trade these loans out to private banks,17
NA,"and individuals. As a matter of fact,",17
NA,the reason why honorable members oppo-,17
NA,site favour the issue of treasury-bills as,17
NA,against the issue of direct credit to the,17
NA,Government by the Commonwealth Bank,17
NA,is this: The issue of treasury-bills bears,17
NA,interest. I t has the same effect as the,17
NA,printing of Commonwealth Bank notes;,17
NA,"it releases credit, and all credit, whether",17
NA,represented by treasury-bills or Com-,17
NA,"monwealth Bank notes, is backed by",17
NA,the future productivity of this country.,17
NA,That is the only way it can be backed.,17
NA,Honorable members opposite object to,17
NA,the note issue being used to provide,17
NA,accommodation for governments on the,17
NA,ground that it is inflation; but they do,17
NA,not object to the financing of governments,17
NA,by the issue of treasury-bills because on,17
NA,treasury-bills the people of this country,17
NA,must pay annual toll. That is,17
NA,the very reason why the Govern-,17
NA,ment favours tbe flotation of short-,17
NA,term loans by treasury-bill issues,17
NA,as against the utilization of the note issue.,17
NA,Interest rates have shown a tendency to,17
NA,"rise. The Treasurer, in attempting to",17
NA,"answer the criticism from this side, com-",17
NA,pared the interest figures of 1929 with,17
NA,those of the present day to show that the,17
NA,rates to-day were much lower than was,17
NA,the case in that year. But he did not,17
NA,answer the charge that interest rates are,17
NA,sug- increasing. Why not compare the inter-,17
NA,est rates of six months ago with those,17
NA,prevailing at the present moment? Be-,17
NA,cause it cannot be denied that interest,17
NA,rates to-day have an upward tendency.,17
NA,"I n November last, a loan of £7,500,000",17
NA,"was floated at 3J per cent., the issue price",17
NA,"being £99 10s. I n the previous June, there",17
NA,"had been a loan of £12,500,000 floated",17
NA,"at 3$ per cent., and issued at £99 10s.",17
NA,So that even in tho very brief period of,17
NA,six months interest rates on Government,17
NA,borrowing have increased inside Aus-,17
NA,"tralia. Let us look, for a moment, at the",17
NA,external position. This Government is,17
NA,being continually praised for what has,17
NA,been done in the conversion of Aus-,17
NA,"tralian loans overseas, particularly",17
NA,through the activities of Mr Bruce. I n,17
NA,July last a conversion loan of approxi-,17
NA,"mately £13,500,000 was negotiated at 3",17
NA,"per cent, and issued at par. I n Janu-",17
NA,"ary, 1936, a further conversion loan of",17
NA,"£21,500,000 was negotiated at 3 per cent,",17
NA,"and issued at £95 10s. I t will be seen,",17
NA,"therefore, that the effective interest rate",17
NA,in regard to that transaction was very,17
NA,much greater than that upon' the first,17
NA,"loan, although the nominal rate of inter-",17
NA,est appeared to be the same. This was,17
NA,during a time when the British Govern-,17
NA,ment was receiving its loan accom-,17
NA,modation at a rate of interest as,17
NA,low as one per cent. The Trea-,17
NA,surer told us yesterday that interest rates,17
NA,were influenced by the confidence that,17
NA,people had in governments. Accepting,17
NA,"his argument as sound for a moment, I",17
NA,suggest that what has happened recently,17
NA,both Avithin Australia and overseas proves,17
NA,conclusively that not only the people of,17
NA,"Australia, but also those of Great Britain,",17
NA,have lost confidence in this Government.,17
NA,I make that assertion on the basis of the,17
NA,Treasurer's own reasoning. Two Aus-,17
NA,tralian banks-th e Bank of New South,17
NA,Wales and the Bank of Adelaide-hav e,17
NA,recently increased their interest rates.,17
NA,"We may be sure, therefore, that i t ""will",18
NA,uot be very long before the other private,18
NA,banks follow suit. Tbe Commonwealth,18
NA,Bank may also be expected to proceed,18
NA,"along the same lines without much delay,",18
NA,for i t is not now a government or a,18
NA,"people's bank, nor has i t been so since the",18
NA,Commonwealth Bank Board,18
NA,appointed i n 1924. The Commonwealth,18
NA,"Bank is, to-day, dominated by the private",18
NA,"banking interests, and is not serving the",18
NA,purpose f o r which i t was originally estab-,18
NA,lished. The private banks w i l l reap a,18
NA,substantial profit through the increase,18
NA,of interest rates. There is no doubt that,18
NA,"they intend, immediately, to raise their",18
NA,"interest rate on overdrafts, but the money",18
NA,they w i l l make available w i l l have been,18
NA,obtained at a cheaper rate of interest,18
NA,"under contract, the terms of which provide",18
NA,that there shall be no increase of interest,18
NA,on deposit money u n t i l such time as the,18
NA,contracts mature. The banks w i l l thereemployment at too fast a rate?,18
NA,fore use' this cheaper money to provide,18
NA,accommodation f o r other interests on,18
NA,overdraft and otherwise at a higher rate,18
NA,of interest. Durin g the debate on the,18
NA,"Supply B i l l i n this chamber i n 1934, the",18
NA,present Treasurer replied to certain state-,18
NA,"ments of the honorable member for ""West",18
NA,Sydney ( Mr Beasley) on this subject.,18
NA,The Hansard report reads as follows:-,18
Mr CASEY ,Hi s remarks are best,18
NA,answered by a very brief reference to the con-,18
NA,sistent decline of the interest rate in this,18
NA,country during the last three years.,18
Mr BLACKLOW ,Wha t is the cause of that?,18
Mr CASEY ,I t is due to the increasing con-,18
NA,fidence of the public in the Government and in,18
NA,the economic future of the country.,18
NA,I should like to hear what the honorable,18
NA,member now has to say i n the altered,18
NA,circumstances which face us.,18
NA,I do not believe that the motive of the,18
NA,Commonwealth Bank Board i n issuing,18
NA,"these treasury-bills has yet been disclosed,",18
NA,for the reason that the board does not,18
NA,wish to repeat the experience i t had pre-,18
NA,viously when i t introduced a policy of,18
NA,deflation i n this country by means of what,18
NA,was known as tbe Premiers plan.,18
NA,plan caused a storm of protest through-,18
NA,"out the country, and although an anti-",18
NA,Labour Government has been able to sur-,18
NA,"vive the storm f o r a period, i t is clearly",18
NA,realized on all sides that a similar storm,18
NA,could not be survived now. The people,18
NA,Mr Ward.,18
NA,would rise i n their wrath and sweep f r o m,18
NA,office any government which sought to,18
NA,impose on them another similar plan.,18
NA,The bank board has therefore decided on,18
NA,this occasion to proceed along more subtle,18
NA,lines. I t has been quite openly discussing,18
NA,"these matters, as can be seen fro m reports",18
NA,was which have appeared i n various sections,18
NA,of the press throughout the country. I,18
NA,direct attention to the following state-,18
NA,"ment of Mr Davidson, manager of the",18
NA,"Bank of New South ""Wales, which ap-",18
NA,peared i n the Sydney Morning Herald of,18
NA,the 4th March last-,18
NA,The Commonwealth Bank for some time has,18
NA,indicated by successive steps that i t has the,18
NA,belief that recovery is proceeding at too fast,18
NA,a rate and therefore ought to be slowed down.,18
NA,What is meant by that? What does,18
NA,recovery mean ? Is i t suggested that our,18
NA,industries are operating too actively and,18
NA,that men are being taken back into,18
NA,That,18
NA,would appear to be the opinion held by,18
NA,the Commonwealth Bank Board and,18
NA,shared by this Government. For this,18
NA,reason i t is proposed to take steps to,18
NA,restrict operations. I n this way f u r -,18
NA,ther attacks are to be made upon the,18
NA,working people of this country and an,18
NA,increase made i n the enormous num-,18
NA,ber of them who are still unemployed. I,18
NA,direct attention also to the following evi,18
NA,dence given recently by Sir Claude Bead-,18
NA,"ing, chairman of the Commonwealth",18
NA,"Bank Board, before the Royal Commis-",18
NA,sion on Banking and Monetary Reform:-,18
NA,""" We have been advising the Government that",18
NA,the proper course would be to fund a reason-,18
NA,able amount of treasury-bills. We think the,18
NA,position would be more definitely strengthened,18
NA,by that course. A good opportunity was lost,18
NA,in 1934 when there was plenty of idle money,18
NA,"available"". He believed that something",18
NA,"between £30,000,000 and £40,000,000 might be",18
NA,regarded as a reasonable short-term debt which,18
NA,Australia could carry without embarrassment.,18
NA,A t the present moment Australia has,18
NA,"short-term debts of about £50,000,000.",18
NA,I f this sum is to be reduced to,18
NA,"£30,000,000, then the treasury-bills to the",18
NA,"That value of £1,000,000 already placed upon",18
NA,the market by the Commonwealth Bank,18
NA,Board must be regarded merely as the,18
NA,"forerunners of others, and we must expect",18
NA,that the board intends to compel the Com-,18
NA,monwealth Government to reduce its,18
NA,short-term indebtedness by this means.,18
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,Thi s action,19
NA,"constitutes not a reduction of, but",19
NA,"merely a cbange in, the form of the",19
NA,indebtedness.,19
Mr WARD ,Whil e that may be true,19
NA,it is also true that by the action which,19
NA,it has just taken the Commonwealth,19
NA,Bank Board is trying to force the Go-,19
NA,vernment to reduce its short-term indebt-,19
NA,edness within Australia. I believe that,19
NA,the Government has already agreed to,19
NA,follow the course set by the Common-,19
NA,"wealth Bank Board, but it is trying to",19
NA,create the impression that it is being,19
NA,pelled to take this course. By this means,19
NA,it hopes to shelve its responsibility to,19
NA,Parliament and the people generally.,19
NA,Certain facts may be recited which can-,19
NA,not be refuted. I t will be remembered,19
NA,"that in 1934, when the Loan Council was",19
NA,considering the subject of State financial,19
NA,"accommodation and loan requirements,",19
NA,"difference of opinion occurred in regard,",19
NA,to the amount tbat shbuld be made avail-,19
NA,able. According to press reports the,19
NA,struggle between the State Premiers and,19
NA,tbe Commonwealth Government extended,19
NA,over a considerable period. Finally the,19
NA,Commonwealth Bank Board agreed that,19
NA,it would finance government deficits for,19
NA,1934-35 by means of treasury-bills only,19
NA,on the understanding that the relevant,19
NA,bills were retired during the financial,19
NA,"year. The board intimated, at the same",19
NA,"time, that it would not in the future",19
NA,finance government deficits by means of,19
NA,treasury-bills but would only adopt this,19
NA,course to meet a lagging in revenue. We,19
NA,can see therefore that in spite of what,19
NA,the Treasurer said yesterday the Common-,19
NA,wealth Bank Board has intimated already,19
NA,to the Commonwealth Government and,19
NA,also to the State governments that it,19
NA,longer prepared to assist governments by,19
NA,discounting treasury-bills. I n the cir-,19
NA,cumstances I wish to know how tbe Go-,19
NA,vernment proposes to assist the anti-,19
NA,"Labour governments of the States, which",19
NA,are in difficulties with their State,19
NA,"budgets, in view of the fact that",19
NA,the Commonwealth Bank Board,19
NA,has definitely refused to discount,19
NA,treasury-bill issues. I n the directors',19
NA,report issued by the Commonwealth Bank,19
NA,Board and received by honorable mem-,19
NA,"bers only to-day, we find a statement in",19
NA,which it is said that the time has arrived,19
NA,when balanced budgets and decreased,19
NA,loan works should be the immediate,19
NA,policy of Australian governments. The,19
NA,"board advocates, not a long-range plan,",19
NA,"but an immediate policy, with all the cuts",19
NA,and sacrifices to be imposed on the,19
NA,workers of Australia. What State go-,19
NA,vernment has yet balanced its budget?,19
NA,"I n New South Wales, the Premier ( Mr.",19
NA,Stevens) is in a precarious position,19
NA,"in regard to the budget, and, i f",19
NA,he finds the opportunity is taken away,19
NA,from him to finance deficits by issuing,19
NA,"treasury-bills, what course will he fol-",19
NA,comlow? He will immediately take tlie course,19
NA,"palatable to him, and further reduce the",19
NA,living standards of the people. Regard-,19
NA,"less of consequences, he will stop relief",19
NA,"works, cut into the widows' pensions and",19
NA,"family endowments, and destroy all social",19
NA,services. His attitude is that the State,19
NA,"budget must be balanced, no matter what",19
NA,sacrifices the people will be called upon,19
NA,to make.,19
NA,Those long-lost friends of the Com-,19
NA,monwealth Bank who sit opposite are,19
NA,attempting to hold it up as an institution,19
NA,which is a model of what a government,19
NA,"bank should be. I n 1911, when a Labour",19
NA,government established the Common-,19
NA,"wealth Bank, it did so for the purpose of",19
NA,its competing with private trading banks.,19
NA,Any honorable members supporting the,19
NA,Government who care to examine the,19
NA,records which are available in the Par-,19
NA,liamentary Library will find that their,19
NA,predecessors in this Parliament bitterly,19
NA,opposed the establishment of the Com-,19
NA,monwealth Bank; but they will also read,19
NA,that when those gentlemen found that,19
NA,they were powerless to prevent the bank,19
NA,from being brought into being they set,19
NA,is no out to sabotage the institution.,19
Dr MALONEY ,"Hear , hear!",19
Mr WARD ,B y their efforts the,19
NA,Commonwealth Bank was changed into,19
NA,an instrument for the protection of the,19
NA,trading banks. I t became a bulwark for,19
NA,the private banks rather than a bank,19
NA,"competing with them. Subsequently,",19
NA,it was given control of the note,19
NA,issue. The Parliament's powers of control,19
NA,over the Commonwealth Bank's activities,19
NA,"were further whittled away, and, in 1924,",19
NA,a nominee bank board was created. I n,19
NA,the years before the establishment of,19
NA,that board the Commonwealth Bank had,19
NA,been able to put through the greatest and,20
NA,most important financial operations in,20
NA,the history of this country. I n defend-,20
NA,"ing the board, honorable members oppo-",20
NA,site have talked about the -wonderful,20
NA,accomplishments of the bank. As a,20
NA,"matter of fact, when the bank was first",20
NA,established every effort was made by those,20
NA,"opposed to it to destroy it, despite which,",20
NA,"without the assistance of a board, the",20
NA,"Commonwealth Bank, which was then in",20
NA,the charge of an efficient governor in,20
NA,"Sir Denison Miller, was able to over-",20
NA,come all difficulties.,20
NA,"At this stage, I want to deal with mis-",20
NA,statements made by the Prime Minister,20
NA,( Mr Lyons). Some of them were ridicu-,20
NA,lous in the extreme. He said tbat in,20
NA,"New South ""Wales to-day unemployment",20
NA,had been reduced to 8 per cent. I do not,20
NA,"know who supplied him with the figures,",20
NA,but in the report of the directors of the,20
NA,Commonwealth Bank issued to-day-and,20
NA,I believe these are conservative figures,20
NA,far from touching the real situation-,20
NA,the percentage of trade union members,20
NA,unemployed for the fourth quarter of,20
NA,"1935 is given as 13.7, a consider-",20
NA,able increase on the percentage,20
NA,indicated in this chamber by the,20
NA,Prime Minister. If that is the,20
NA,"position, does it account for the resigna-",20
NA,tion of the former Under-Secretary for,20
NA,Employment ( Sir Frederick Stewart) ?,20
NA,If the Prime Minister's figure be,20
NA,"accepted, we would appear to be in a",20
NA,better position regarding unemployment,20
NA,"than before what are called "" depression",20
NA,"years "", whose advent made it necessary",20
NA,for the Commonwealth and State Go-,20
NA,vernments to undertake the responsi-,20
NA,"bility of feeding unemployed, who",20
NA,formerly were left to the charity,20
NA,of relatives and certain charitable insti-,20
NA,tutions outside governmental activities.,20
NA,The Prime Minister may tell us why the,20
NA,honorable member for Parramatta was,20
NA,forced to resign his position as Under-,20
NA,Secretary for Employment. Was it,20
NA,cause members of the Government felt,20
NA,that he had no further work to do in,20
NA,that capacity? Does his resignation also,20
NA,indicate the intention of the Goverument,20
NA,to drop the proposal being forced upon it,20
NA,to introduce a shorter working week in,20
NA,"country? The Prime Minister's figures,",20
NA,"no doubt, will be cited and used as an",20
NA,Mr Ward.,20
NA,authoritative statement of the position,20
NA,of the employment market in Australia.,20
NA,I t may be said by those charged with the,20
NA,investigation of the question of hours of,20
NA,"labour, that, i f the unemployment level",20
NA,"is down to 8 per cent., there is no need to",20
NA,"reduce hours, because, i f they are reduced,",20
NA,a shortage of labour may occur. That,20
NA,might be an argument advanced by the,20
NA,Government against a reduction of hours,20
NA,of labour. The Australian representative,20
NA,at the conference of the International,20
NA,Labour Office ( Sir Frederick Stewart),20
NA,was authorized by the Government to,20
NA,support the proposal for a shorter work-,20
NA,"ing week, but what has been done by the",20
NA,Government to ratify the convention,20
NA,adopted by the conference ? I n connexion,20
NA,"with this matter, the Government is now",20
NA,proposing to send another honorable,20
NA,member overseas. I refer to the honor-,20
NA,able member for Bendigo ( Mr E. F.,20
NA,Harrison),20
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! The honor-,20
NA,able member for East Sydney ( Mr.,20
NA,Ward) is getting a good deal away from,20
NA,the terms of the motion.,20
Mr WARD ,Th e Prime Minister,20
NA,made reference to the position of unem-,20
NA,"ployment in Australia, and I am attempt-",20
NA,ing to show that the Government has,20
NA,used erroneous information for the pur-,20
NA,pose of dropping the proposal that hours,20
NA,of labour should be reduced. Regarding,20
NA,"this question of hours of labour,",20
NA,it would be interesting for the Prime,20
NA,Minister to tell us exactly what course the,20
NA,Government proposes to take. Can any,20
NA,indication of its policy be gained from,20
NA,the fact that i t has deliberately selected,20
NA,a man to represent the Government at,20
NA,tbe International Labour Conference at,20
NA,Geneva who has no knowledge of in-,20
NA,"dustry, and who all his life has been",20
NA,engaged in soldiering?,20
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! The hon-,20
NA,orable member's remarks are entirely,20
NA,be- irrelevant. The honorable member has,20
NA,exhausted his time.,20
NA,NA,20
NA,for the Interior) [3.38] -Th e Prime,20
NA,"Minister ( Mr Lyons), the Treasurer",20
NA,"( Mr Casey), the Minister for Trade and",20
NA,"this Customs ( Mr White), and several other",20
NA,honorable gentlemen have so completely,20
NA,and effectively disposed of the charges,20
NA,brought against the Government by the,20
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr CuTtin),21
NA,"that very little remains to be said, and,",21
NA,"in consequence, I do not propose-no r is",21
NA,it necessary-t o occupy the time of the,21
NA,House for more than a few moments.,21
NA,"Like his predecessor, the Leader of the",21
NA,Opposition is a very eloquent and attrac-,21
NA,"tive speaker; but, despite that, in all my",21
NA,"experience in Parliament, I have never",21
NA,seen a previous censure motion fall so,21
NA,flat as this censure motion has done. The,21
NA,honorable gentleman directed his criti-,21
NA,"cism, or part of it, to the action of the",21
NA,Commonwealth Bank in making,21
NA,"£1,000,000 of existing treasury-bills",21
NA,available to the public at a rate which,21
NA,has been current for some considerable,21
NA,time. When that decision was arrived at,21
NA,"and announced in the morning press, it",21
NA,was quietly received. No heroics were,21
NA,indulged in by honorable members oppo-,21
NA,site. The announcement was received,21
NA,with absolute complacency and such news-,21
NA,paper comments as appeared at the time,21
NA,"were entirely favorable. Everything, in",21
NA,"short, was quiet on the western front.",21
NA,"Then, several days later, the manager of",21
NA,a great private bank gave notice of the,21
NA,intention of that institution to raise,21
NA,"interest rates on deposits, and it seems",21
NA,"to me that, with an ingenuity worthy of",21
NA,the honorable member who has just,21
NA,"resumed his seat, he laid the necessity for",21
NA,that action on the doorstep of the Com-,21
NA,monwealth Bank and of the Common-,21
NA,wealth Government. Immediately this,21
NA,"announcement appeared in the press,",21
NA,lionorable members opposite woke up.,21
NA,Here was an opportunity to be grasped;,21
NA,here was something that must not be,21
NA,missed. Thi3 was a chance to beat the,21
NA,Government with a cudgel conveniently,21
NA,placed in their hands by the representa-,21
NA,tive of a great private bank. I t was,21
NA,interesting to see how readily honorable,21
NA,members opposite allied themselves with,21
NA,"the representative of private enterprise,",21
NA,"whose methods they professed to despise,",21
NA,and how quickly they began to attack that,21
NA,"bank, which, up to then; they had always",21
NA,regarded as their very own child. This,21
NA,"action of the Commonwealth Bank, which",21
NA,had at first been received by honorable,21
NA,"members opposite with such equanimity,",21
NA,"such unconcern, such complacency,",21
NA,"suddenly became a most sinister thing,",21
NA,"f u l l of grave portent, and liable to be",21
NA,followed by the most appalling conse-,21
NA,quences. Honorable members opposite,21
NA,are only too willing to believe in the,21
NA,possibility of those appalling conse-,21
NA,"quences, though the nature of them they",21
NA,"are unable to understand. I n saying that,",21
NA,I do not. desire to cast any aspersion on,21
NA,the intelligence of honorable members,21
NA,"opposite, because I do not think that this",21
NA,experiment of the Oomsmonwealth Bank,21
NA,has been long enough in operation for any,21
NA,one to be able to say just what its advan-,21
NA,tages or disadvantages may ultimately be.,21
NA,"I n my opinion, the importance of the step",21
NA,taken by the directors of the Common-,21
NA,wealth Bank in making this very limited,21
NA,amount of existing treasury-bills avail-,21
NA,able to the public has been magnified out,21
NA,of all reason. To say that this thing is,21
NA,a storm in a tea-cup is an exaggeration;,21
NA,it is nothing more than a bubble i n a,21
NA,thimble.,21
NA,The honorable member for East Sydney,21
NA,( Mr Ward) referred to tbe general rise,21
NA,"of interest rates, and asked why the",21
NA,Treasurer had not replied to the,21
NA,charges made in that respect. He,21
NA,asked what was the cause of the upward,21
NA,trend of interest rates. One does not need,21
NA,to be a treasurer skilled i n matters of,21
NA,finance to be able to answer that question.,21
NA,Any intelligent person knows that interest,21
NA,rates must harden to some extent just so,21
NA,soon as confidence in industry places,21
NA,a sufficient demand on the money avail-,21
NA,able. Let us go back a few years and,21
NA,"follow the trend of interest rates, and try",21
NA,to discover the reason for their fluctua-,21
NA,tion. When the Scullin Government,21
NA,"brought down its loan conversion scheme,",21
NA,the interest rate on gilt-edged securities,21
NA,"became, nominally, 4 per cent. However,",21
NA,"although the nominal rate was 4 per cent.,",21
NA,the actual rate of interest earned,21
NA,"was, for a considerable time, about",21
NA,"5 per cent., because there was not",21
NA,sufficient public confidence even in,21
NA,government securities to keep them at,21
NA,par on the open market. Then the Lyons,21
NA,Government came into office; public con-,21
NA,fidence in the value of government stocks,21
NA,"improved steadily, and the price rose to",21
NA,par.,21
Mr SCULLIN ,Doe s not the Minister,21
NA,know that the price of government bonds,21
NA,rose £20 in the £100 during the four,21
NA,months before the Lyons Government,22
NA,came into office?,22
NA,NA,22
NA,detract from any good work done by the,22
NA,"right honorable gentleman, and I should",22
NA,be the last to take from him any credit,22
NA,which is due to him. The price of,22
NA,government bonds rose steadily and when,22
NA,par was reached not only was the,22
NA,"nominal rate 4 per cent., but the actual",22
NA,earning power of the bonds was also only,22
NA,"4 per cent. Eor some time after that,",22
NA,public confidence was not sufficiently,22
NA,restored to encourage the investment of,22
NA,any great amount of money in ordinary,22
NA,"industrial projects, so that for many",22
NA,people tbe one really safe avenue for,22
NA,investment was government securities. The,22
NA,price of such securities rose until,22
NA,nary £100 bonds were selling at as much,22
NA,"as £107, ancl the actual earning power",22
NA,of the bonds was reduced to a little over,22
NA,"3 per cent. Eventually, however, confid-",22
NA,"ence was completely restored, and",22
NA,now funds are being freely invested in,22
NA,"commercial and industrial enterprises,",22
NA,so that the market for government securifinancial,22
NA,"ties has weakened, and the price has",22
NA,fallen somewhat. The honorable member,22
NA,for East Sydney said that the greatest,22
NA,achievements of the Commonwealth Bank,22
NA,had taken place during the time when,22
NA,there was no Commonwealth Bank Board.,22
NA,Have honorable members forgotten the,22
NA,great part that the board played during,22
NA,the difficult times of the depression?,22
NA,The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr.,22
NA,"Curtin) said that, in order to improve",22
NA,"our financial position overseas, imports",22
NA,should be substantially reduced. I t,22
NA,interesting to hear such a statement,22
NA,coming from a Western Australian. He,22
NA,"said that, unless this course were taken,",22
NA,our finances would be thrown into,22
NA,"order, and unemployment would increase.",22
NA,The Prime Minister ( Mr Lyons) showed,22
NA,yesterday that never before have so,22
NA,persons been employed in secondary,22
NA,industry. The number of such employees,22
NA,"is now about 460,000. Paradoxical",22
NA,"though it may seem, it is an indisputable",22
NA,"fact that, when importing is brisk the",22
NA,"volume of employment is greatest, and",22
NA,there is a good reason for that. For,22
NA,"instance, when a motor chassis is brought",22
NA,"into this country, a body has to be built",22
NA,"for it, tyres must be provided, and other",22
NA,accessories made in Australian factories,22
NA,have to be attached. When the car is put,22
NA,"into commission, considerable employ-",22
NA,ment is provided for persons employed in,22
NA,"garages, &c. Moreover, a considerable",22
NA,proportion of our imports consists of raw,22
NA,"material, which is made up in our own",22
NA,"factories. Of recent importations, plant",22
NA,and equipment have formed a consider-,22
NA,able part and these imports provide em-,22
NA,ployment not only for those who erect the,22
NA,"equipment, but also for those who subse-",22
NA,quently employ it in the production of,22
NA,goods. Labour is needed to operate i t as,22
NA,well as to set it up. Whatever doubts,22
NA,may have been entertained by honorable,22
NA,members opposite with respect to our,22
NA,"trade balance, the latest figures quoted",22
NA,ordiyesterday by the Prime Minister,22
NA,must have dispelled them. The,22
NA,right honorable gentleman pointed out,22
NA,"that already, with little more than eight",22
NA,"months of the financial year gone, after",22
NA,paying for our imports we have a balance,22
NA,"greater by £1,600,000 than we had at the",22
NA,end of the twelve months i n the last,22
NA,"year, the respective figures being",22
NA,"£17.700,000 and £16,100,000. Australian",22
NA,wool is realizing a substantial price,22
NA,"to-day, and a good deal of the clip has",22
NA,yet to be sold. Wool is Australia's,22
NA,greatest asset.,22
NA,"I shall not detain the House longer,",22
NA,because I feel that it is absolutely un-,22
NA,necessary for me to do so. Even i f the,22
NA,Leader of the Opposition is not to-day,22
NA,"prepared to admit it, I hope and believe",22
NA,that before the year closes he will have,22
NA,very good cause to agree that his motion,22
NA,was has proved to be simply an airy super-,22
NA,structure without any foundation.,22
Mr HOLLOWAY ,Melbourne Ports),22
NA,[3.51] - I preface my remarks by saying,22
NA,disthat when Parliament debates a big,22
NA,fundamental problem of this charac-,22
NA,"ter, it is a pity honorable members",22
NA,many cannot refrain from indulging in,22
NA,personal post mortems. I deprecate,22
NA,the suggestion of Ministers that this,22
NA,"is not an important question, and",22
NA,that there is nothing which calls for a,22
NA,reply. The Prime Minister ( Mr Lyons),22
NA,has suggested that we on this side have,22
NA,lost the faith and respect that we once,22
NA,"held for the Commonwealth Bank, and",22
NA,"that, by reason of our attitude on this",22
NA,"occasion, we have more or less discarded",22
NA,our adherence to it as an institution.,23
NA,That is a misconception. I have too,23
NA,great a knowledge of the judgment and,23
NA,wisdom of Ministers to believe that they,23
NA,misunderstand our attitude. I t is not,23
NA,fair to say that because we are at vari-,23
NA,ance with the Government on account of,23
NA,its failure to determine what the policy,23
NA,of the Commonwealth Bank Board shall,23
NA,"be, we have lost faith in the",23
NA,instrumentality itself. I have tho,23
NA,greatest respect and admiration for,23
NA,"the Commonwealth Bank, and my",23
NA,admiration for it grows every year.,23
NA,The majority of honorable members,23
NA,"opposite, however, because of the",23
NA,"political views which they hold, have",23
NA,always been opposed to it. As a matter,23
NA,"of fact, the great organs of public opinion",23
NA,in this country predicted at its establish-,23
NA,ment that it would not live for more than,23
NA,six months.,23
NA,NA,23
NA,ground within recent years.,23
Mr HOLLOWAY ,O f course it,23
NA,has. I t has vindicated the judgment of,23
NA,"the Labour movement, which has always",23
NA,stressed the necessity for such an institu-,23
NA,tion and advocated the strengthening of,23
NA,it. Ministers must agree that at least we,23
NA,have been consistent in our advocacy of,23
NA,greater freedom being given to the bank,23
NA,and the removal of it from the manacles,23
NA,placed upon it by the Bruce-Page Govern-,23
NA,ment in 1924. I can never forget,23
NA,the terrible misery and travail,23
NA,through which the world has passed,23
NA,during the last fifteen years as the,23
NA,result of the organized method,23
NA,adopted to bring about deflation.,23
NA,Three or four years ago I made the state-,23
NA,ment that fifteen years ago those who,23
NA,control the financial affairs of the world,23
NA,had purposely inaugurated the plan,23
NA,which brought about the period of defla-,23
NA,tion. When I first made the statement,23
NA,I was almost ridiculed by the present,23
NA,Treasurer ( Mr Casey). I do not blame,23
NA,"him for that. Possibly, I had the reports",23
NA,of the International Labour Office before,23
NA,"he received them, and on that account",23
NA,felt sure of my ground. I am confident,23
NA,"that to-day he, the Prime Minister, and",23
NA,"every other honorable member opposite,",23
NA,will agree that I then stated what was,23
NA,an actual fact. What was the result?,23
NA,Everybody remembers the advice given by,23
NA,"Professor Cassels, when he appealed to",23
NA,the controllers of finance not to take,23
NA,action that would bring about deflation.,23
NA,He pointed out that deflation would grow,23
NA,"like a snowball, and that its momentum",23
NA,would become so great that they would,23
NA,not know how to arrest it and the world,23
NA,would be brought to a state of ruin and,23
NA,"chaos, from which it would take decades",23
NA,to recover. Surely tbe lesson which we,23
NA,learned in Australia during the,23
NA,depression of the last six or seven,23
NA,"years, with the travail, poverty,",23
NA,misery and unemployment then wit-,23
NA,"nessed, should cause us to be dubious",23
NA,about agreeing to a similar suggestion!,23
NA,All the great financial writers of the,23
NA,world have continually urged upon gov-,23
NA,ernments and the great institutions which,23
NA,"control finance, the wisdom not of cur-",23
NA,"tailing inflation in any way, but rather",23
NA,of making more elastic the distribution,23
NA,of credit until we had at least reached,23
NA,the standard of values which existed in,23
NA,"1929. Yet, while we are still not yet",23
NA,"around the corner, while we are still",23
NA,struggling to get back to something like,23
NA,the position of 192S-29 we have this sug-,23
NA,gested experiment. Surely the statement,23
NA,on the matter in the report of tbe Com-,23
NA,monwealth Bank Board is an endorsement,23
NA,of the assertion of the Leader of the,23
NA,"Opposition, that this will have a defla-",23
NA,tionary influence on the currency of the,23
NA,country! The board itself says that it,23
NA,is necessary to restrict the amount of,23
NA,loan money made available for public,23
NA,works. .Such a policy must mean more,23
NA,unemployment and a reduced spending,23
NA,power. Is not that identical with what,23
NA,"was done in 1920, when orders were given",23
NA,to all the business institutions of the,23
NA,"world that they must not, from that date,",23
NA,"recapitalize any of their profits, that",23
NA,they must restrict rather than extend,23
NA,"their operations, that they must cut",23
NA,everything to the bone for the purpose of,23
NA,bringing about a period of deflation which,23
NA,would reduce the rates of interest and,23
NA,all other values to those that ruled in,23
NA,"1914? That action was taken, notwith-",23
NA,standing the advice of all the greatest,23
NA,"economists, and every one has suffered as",23
NA,"a result. Since then, all of those who",23
NA,have taken a leading part in the con-,23
NA,sideration of world problems have,23
NA,sounded the warning that nothing should,23
NA,be done to checkmate the upward ten-,24
NA,dency until the 1923 values had again,24
NA,"been reached, when whatever steps wis-",24
NA,doln dictated should be taken to make,24
NA,the position stable at that point.,24
NA,Although we have not nearly reached,24
NA,"that stage, it is suggested that the release",24
NA,of credit for public works should be dis-,24
NA,"continued, aiid that the operations of the",24
NA,Commonwealth Bank should be so con-,24
NA,ducted that a period of gradual deflation,24
NA,"would return. Yet, in the same breath,",24
NA,the people of Great Britain are being,24
NA,urged to begin a period of emigration!,24
NA,"Imagine a government, one of the prin-",24
NA,cipal instruments of which is doing what,24
NA,nifty have a tendency to bring about,24
NA,deflation^ and thus cause unemployment,24
NA,"to become greater, negotiating with other",24
NA,governments for the introduction of immi-,24
NA,gTauts to this country! Sitrely in siich,24
NA,dirciimstances it is right that We should,24
NA,protest against this proposal!,24
NA,In what I am about to say upon the,24
NA,"purely financial aspect of economics, I",24
NA,"speak with a good deal of temerity, be-",24
NA,cause I do not consider that I am capable,24
NA,of analysing the very intricate financial,24
NA,questions involved; but I have had oppor-,24
NA,"tunities to study economics generally, and",24
NA,I know something of industrial history;,24
NA,I am absolutely certain that we shall,24
NA,never have real prosperity in Australia,24
NA,Until interest rates rise; As a student,24
NA,"of economies, I welcome any increase of",24
NA,interest rates that is the result of a,24
NA,"legitimate demand foi"" credit for use in",24
NA,industrial activities. Increases of wagesj,24
NA,"prices, and values generally, must auto-",24
NA,matically cause interest rates to rise;,24
NA,Surely that is obvious to any student of,24
NA,"economics! If wages, prices, and values",24
NA,generally are restored to the level of,24
NA,"1928-29, interest rates will revert to some-",24
NA,thing approaching what they then were.,24
NA,I personally believe that they were too,24
NA,"high, and that the money-lenders made",24
NA,"excess profits. I am satisfied, however,",24
NA,that good government would prevent their,24
NA,rising to as high as they then were.,24
NA,Under the present economic system real,24
NA,prosperity can be brought about only by,24
NA,a constant demand by the captains of,24
NA,industry for more credit. A legitimate,24
NA,demand for money for investment in,24
NA,industrial activity must of necessity,24
NA,increase interest rates. If increased by,24
NA,Mr Holloway.,24
NA,"that process, good would result. This",24
NA,"proposal, however, is illegitimate and can",24
NA,only bring about deflation. No student,24
NA,of economics will argue that it is bad,24
NA,for interest rates gradually to rise. We,24
NA,"are protesting on this occasion, because",24
NA,the issue of treasUry-bills will not increase,24
NA,credit for immediate investment in indus-,24
NA,"trial operations, but will merely mean",24
NA,the withdrawal of deposits from other,24
NA,avenues for the purpose of obtaining a,24
NA,'slightly higher rate of interest. That,24
NA,would be merely to take moiiey from one,24
NA,pocket and put it in another. The party,24
NA,of which I am a member protests against,24
NA,"such a policy. Our real protest, however,",24
NA,is against the action of the Government,24
NA,in making itself subordinate to one of,24
NA,its own instruments-tli e only instrument,24
NA,in this Country owned by the people that,24
NA,can issue credit which has the backing,24
NA,of the nation's assets. Everybody knows,24
NA,"that when a country wishes to borrow,",24
NA,those who have to determine whether it,24
NA,is a gilt-edged proposition examine its,24
NA,natural visible and invisible assets. Take,24
NA,Australia for examnle. They ask their,24
NA,"advisers: "" What standard of education",24
NA,have the Australian people? What is,24
NA,theii' technical knowledge? What have,24
NA,"they in visible and invisible assets ? "" The",24
NA,order in which the countries of the world,24
NA,"are placed is: Great Britain, No. 1;",24
NA,"United States of America, No. 2; Canada",24
NA,"and Australia, Nos. 3 and 4. I have",24
NA,quoted figures dozens of times before the,24
NA,courts of this country to show why Aus-,24
NA,tralia is not in the position in which it,24
NA,was once said to be. I have never known,24
NA,those who have the lending of money,24
NA,internationally to place Australia lower,24
NA,than third or fourth among the nations,24
NA,of the world. We should be proud of,24
NA,its position and not continually malign,24
NA,it by adopting an inferiority complex.,24
NA,Australia is regarded as a good asset by,24
NA,every money-lender in the world. Doubt,24
NA,is raised regarding it only when Aus-,24
NA,tralians who go abroad tell the wrong,24
NA,story concerning the value of its assets.,24
NA,A very highly titled and respected lady,24
NA,who recently arrived in Australia from,24
NA,"London, repeated what her father said",24
NA,when he was here a few years ago.,24
NA,"That gentleman, then Sir Hugo Hirst,",24
NA,"now Lord Hirst, said to me, "" Your own",24
NA,people are largely responsible for the way,24
NA,in wliich your country is regarded by,25
NA,"people abroad."" When in Great Britain,",25
NA,Australians often make statements of,25
NA,which they should be ashamed. The,25
NA,"credit of our nation stands high, and we",25
NA,should never be refused loans i f the Go-,25
NA,"vernment earnestly desired to get them,",25
NA,l f we used our own Uommunweanh JJaiik,25
NA,there would be no need to raise loans from,25
NA,private sources.,25
NA,The criticism offered by the Opposition,25
NA,is not directed against the Commonwealth,25
NA,"Bank, which is an institution of which",25
NA,"We are proud. We say, however, that the",25
NA,Government has no right to hand over the,25
NA,"control of this instrument, which was",25
NA,"created by the people of Australia, to a",25
NA,board such as that which now directs its,25
NA,policy. The board should be free to,25
NA,"manage the bank as it sees fit,",25
NA,but the Government should define the,25
NA,policy.-Noinstitution in the land is more,25
NA,admirably equipped for the issuing of,25
NA,"loans to the people, yet the Government",25
NA,is so unpatriotic that it borrows from tbe,25
NA,private banks. I f it paid interest to the,25
NA,"Commonwealth Bank, the money could be",25
NA,used in discharging some of our internal,25
NA,and external indebtedness. Our opinion,25
NA,of the Commonwealth Bank becomes,25
NA,"higher each year, but wo contend that the",25
NA,charter which the Government has handed,25
NA,to the board is wrong. My view of this,25
NA,matter is supported by that of thousands,25
NA,of others who have spoken on the subject,25
NA,in various parts of the world since the,25
NA,beginning of the period of deflation. I n,25
NA,"1933, shortly before he died, Mr Basil",25
NA,"Blackett, referring to Australia's financial 'blood of our economic society.",25
NA,problems^ said that we should use the,25
NA,bank of the nation to create the credit,25
NA,necessary for carrying out our industrial,25
NA,programme. This policy would enable,25
NA,us to provide money needed for internal,25
NA,"works, and would assist in meeting our",25
NA,overseas obligations. He said that any,25
NA,country which had an instrument such as,25
NA,"the Commonwealth Bank could do that,",25
NA,and he added that owing to our central,25
NA,bank working in co-operation with the,25
NA,private banks instead of as a competitor,25
NA,"with them, we had turned a good servant",25
NA,into a hard and inhuman master. The,25
NA,Opposition contends that the present Go-,25
NA,vernment has done that by handing over,25
NA,the complete control of the Common-,25
NA,wealth Bank to the board. I have no,25
NA,complaint regarding the character of the,25
NA,members of the board. They are estim-,25
NA,"able gentlemen, and as big-hearted as any",25
NA,member of this chamber; but their life-,25
NA,long training in the service of private,25
NA,banks has made i t impossible for,25
NA,them to act other than as they did,25
NA,when working for the profit of the share-,25
NA,holders of private banks. I f they had,25
NA,"not done that, they would no longer have",25
NA,been kept in their positions as directors.,25
Mr HUGHES ,Tha t criticism is not,25
NA,applicable to the members of the Com-,25
NA,monwealth Bank Board.,25
Mr HOLLOWAY , I consider that i t,25
NA,is. The right honorable gentleman,25
NA,means that they may not now be directors,25
NA,on the boards of private banks; but how,25
NA,"could they, in the closing period of their",25
NA,"lives, change the views which they formed",25
NA,"in the service of private banks, and in",25
NA,which many of them have personal,25
NA,"interests, although they are not directors?",25
NA,I f I were a member of the board of a pri-,25
NA,vate bank I should have to compete with,25
NA,"the other banks, in order to show a satis-",25
NA,"factory balance-sheet, and prove that I",25
NA,had been a good manager. The Opposi-,25
NA,"tion points out that the Government,",25
NA,"wliich represents the people of Australia,",25
NA,and stands for the good government of the,25
NA,people-whic h means the provision of,25
NA,permanent employment and a fair distri-,25
NA,bution of the wealth produced in the com-,25
NA,munity-shoul d not hand over to a board,25
NA,created by Parliament the complete,25
NA,"control of an institution which should,",25
NA,"and does, control the supply of the life-",25
NA,When,25
NA,medical men fail to effect cures of their,25
NA,"patients by ordinary methods, they often,",25
NA,"as a last resort, infuse new blood into",25
NA,"their veins. We find that, economically,",25
NA,Australia has been squeezed dry because,25
NA,of the interest payments made abroad and,25
NA,among the private banking institutions in,25
NA,"Australia. Therefore, we suggest that we",25
NA,should gradually but surely infuse new,25
NA,blood into our economic system by releas-,25
NA,ing more credit to enable us to recapture,25
NA,our former position.,25
NA,The Commonwealth Bank Board can-,25
NA,not now contend that inflation would,25
NA,"cause collapse, but a majority of its mem-",25
NA,"bers say, "" Although we have done fairly",25
NA,"well, we suggest that care should be",25
NA,exercised. We shall experiment with this,25
NA,"small issue of treasury-bills, so that what",26
NA,was said in our report must be done will,26
NA,"be done."" I n that report the board",26
NA,advised the governments of Australia to,26
NA,restrict their loans for public works.,26
NA,These are necessary to give an impetus to,26
NA,"industry, and surely at this stage,",26
NA,when a slight move towards prosperity is,26
NA,"apparent, we should protest against the",26
NA,board taking complete control of the,26
NA,financial situation. The Prime Minister,26
NA,has told us that the Government is not,26
NA,concerned about the board's action.,26
NA,"Having faith in the board, it has no in-",26
NA,tention to interfere with it. I respect,26
NA,Treasurer for having told us as much as,26
NA,"he did on this matter, but I draw particu-",26
NA,lar attention to what he actually,26
NA,did say. I n addition to the state-,26
NA,ment made by the Prime Minister,26
NA,that the Government would not interfere,26
NA,"with the board, the Treasurer remarked",26
NA,"that the Loan Council, not the Govern-",26
NA,"ment, was and would be consulted by the",26
NA,board. That assertion made the position,26
NA,"worse, because the Government is to be",26
NA,subordinate to both the Loan Council,26
NA,and the board. My protest is against the,26
NA,attitude of the Government itself for not,26
NA,determining the policy of the board.,26
NA,"Our attack, as I have said, is not against",26
NA,the Commonwealth Bank as an institu-,26
NA,"tion, but against the monetary policy of",26
NA,of the Ministry. The Labour party,26
NA,regards the bank as one of its own,26
NA,children. I consider it to be the greatest,26
NA,asset the Commonwealth has.,26
NA,The right honorable member for North,26
NA,Sydney ( Mr Hughes) could tell us the,26
NA,Story of the failure of all' the private,26
NA,banking institutions of this country when,26
NA,he and other Ministers called them,26
NA,together on the eve of the war of 1914-,26
NA,1918. The right honorable gentleman,26
NA,and his colleagues summoned a conference,26
NA,of representatives of the leading banks,26
NA,"of Australia, and, when he asked them",26
NA,what they could do towards financing,26
NA,"Australia's war expenditure, they replied,",26
NA,""" This is too big a job for the private",26
NA,"banks."" In substance, the right honor-",26
NA,"able gentleman then said "" Surely, if all",26
NA,"you gentlemen pool your interests, and for",26
NA,the time being become one big co-opera-,26
NA,"tive bank, rather than independent",26
NA,"private banks as you are in normal times,",26
NA,you can finance the Government's opera-,26
NA,Mr Holloway.,26
NA,"tions!"" But they replied, "" No, we can-",26
NA,"not do i t . "" Thereupon, one of the",26
NA,Ministers said to the Governor of the,26
NA,"Commonwealth Bank, "" Mr Miller, what",26
NA,"can you do to help us?"" The manager",26
NA,of this little bank which had just been,26
NA,"established, and whose funds amounted",26
NA,"to only £2,000,000 or £3,000,000-i t did",26
NA,not need even that amount of money-,26
NA,"answered, "" Well, Mr Minister, I can do",26
NA,whatever you conceive to be necessary to,26
NA,be done. Whatever the Government,26
NA,"wants this bank to do, i t can do."" At",26
NA,that time the institution was only two or,26
NA,"the three years old, but with a manager and",26
NA,"a small staff-i t had no elaborate board,",26
NA,and no advisers from the University or,26
NA,the Statistician's Department-i t raised,26
NA,"£300,000,000 at the average cost of",26
NA,5s. 7d. per cent. The cheapest,26
NA,rate at wliich government money has,26
NA,been raised in other circumstances is,26
NA,"13s. lOd. per cent., which was the cost",26
NA,involved two or three years ago when,26
NA,the interest rate was not half of that,26
NA,ruling when the Commonwealth Bank,26
NA,charges amounted to only 5s. 7d. per,26
NA,cent. The bank could have gone on doing,26
NA,that. Surely it would be a good thing,26
NA,"i f the £12,000,000 recently obtained from",26
NA,the private banks were advanced by the,26
NA,Commonwealth Bank. I t would mean,26
NA,"that the £5,600,000 to be paid in",26
NA,interest would be earned by the people's,26
NA,bank. When we have to renew the,26
NA,loan we shall have paid a huge,26
NA,"amount of interest to the private banks,",26
NA,"and we shall still owe the principal, i f",26
NA,we were to pay the interest to the Com-,26
NA,"monwealth Bank, the money would be",26
NA,available to help in carrying on public,26
NA,works such as the standardization of rail-,26
NA,way gauges and in paying off our debts,26
NA,"overseas. This is not done, but not",26
NA,because it would not be possible to do it.,26
NA,I do not say this out of any personal,26
NA,"animosity, but simply because of my",26
NA,political principles. The real fight in,26
NA,this matter is that the Labour party,26
NA,"believes in a nationally-owned bank, that",26
NA,banking is too big a job for private,26
NA,"enterprise, and that through i t private",26
NA,enterprise wields too great a power over,26
NA,the people. Por this reason we claim,26
NA,that the control of banking should be,26
NA,kept outside the hands of private enter-,26
NA,prise. We contend that the Common-,26
NA,wealth Bank should control the banking,27
NA,policy laid down by the Grovern-,27
NA,ment and that it should be owned and,27
NA,"backed by the people of Australia, that",27
NA,"it should do ""all the work at least of",27
NA,"government departments, earning interest",27
NA,which can be used over and over again,27
NA,to meet the financial commitments of,27
NA,"governments, rather than that such",27
NA,interest should go into the pockets of,27
NA,private people. That is our policy so,27
NA,far as banking is concerned. Unlike,27
NA,members of the Government we are,27
NA,opposed to private ownership controlling,27
NA,the banking policy of this country. So,27
NA,long as these two opinions are held there,27
NA,"will always be a conflict, similar to that",27
NA,which now exists between the Govern-,27
NA,ment and this Opposition. I n that con-,27
NA,flict we may sum up our position as,27
NA,"follows: ""What we predicted about the",27
NA,"Commonwealth Bank 20 years ago, and",27
NA,"was ridiculed as ""fiduciary"" proposals",27
NA,by members of the party which to-day,27
NA,"speaks as the Government, is now pro-",27
NA,nounced correct by tbe greatest thinkers,27
NA,on finance in all countries. To-day at,27
NA,"least 75 per cent, of what is called money,",27
NA,and which has been released for the,27
NA,carrying on of activities throughout the,27
NA,"world, is issued on a fiduciary basis.",27
Mr JOHN LAWSON ,Macquarie),27
NA,[4.22] - I assure honorable members,27
NA,that I accept unequivocally the prin-,27
NA,"ciple that the Government should not,",27
NA,"in any circumstances, attempt to direct",27
NA,the policy of the Commonwealth Bank,27
NA,"Board, but I cannot associate myself with",27
NA,the scheme underlying the attack,27
NA,launched against the Government by the,27
NA,"Opposition, because I believe that that",27
NA,attack has been based on entirely false,27
NA,premises. The main issue is not the,27
NA,effect of the decision of the Common-,27
NA,wealth Bank Board to issue treasury-,27
NA,"bills to the public upon the trade balance,",27
NA,nor whether the Commonwealth Govern-,27
NA,ment should attempt in any way to direct,27
NA,the policy of the board along the lines,27
NA,condemned by the Prime Minister ( Mr.,27
NA,Lyons). I believe that it is whether,27
NA,or not the bank board is seeking to usurp,27
NA,the powers and the functions of Parlia-,27
NA,"ment, and to play a determining part",27
NA,in the financial policy of this Govern-,27
NA,ment. As it is the bank with which the,27
NA,"Government does its banking business, it",27
NA,is in a particularly favorable position,27
NA,to adopt that role; it underwrites Go-,27
NA,vernment loans; it plays a very strong,27
NA,part in determining interest rates; it,27
NA,finances treasury-bills; it controls the,27
NA,"note issue; it controls the gold reserve,",27
NA,and it is also a big factor in determining,27
NA,the general policy of the trading banks.,27
NA,"I believe, therefore, that it is wrong in",27
NA,principle for Government representatives,27
NA,-a s some have done during this debate,27
NA,-t o display nothing more than a pass-,27
NA,ing interest in the policy of the Common-,27
NA,"wealth Bank Board, or to express the",27
NA,view that the motive of the Common-,27
NA,"wealth Bank Board, in making available",27
NA,"to the public this issue of treasury-bills,",27
NA,is of no concern to this Government. I,27
NA,"submit most emphatically that, whether",27
NA,"we like it or not, we have to face the fact",27
NA,that the policy of the Commonwealth,27
NA,Bank Board can make or break govern-,27
NA,ments.,27
Mr BEASLEY ,An d i t can break the,27
NA,"country, too.",27
Mr JOHN LAWSON ,Tea . To this,27
NA,extent it is a sacred obligation on the,27
NA,Commonwealth Government to concern,27
NA,itself very closely with the policy of the,27
NA,Commonwealth Bank Board.. As has been,27
NA,indicated by the honorable member for,27
NA,"Melbourne Ports ( Mr Holloway), the",27
NA,bank is a child of the Commonwealth,27
NA,"Government, which, from time to time, as",27
NA,"vacancies occur, appoints the members to",27
NA,the board. No matter what our ideas,27
NA,"on banking generally are, we have to",27
NA,admit ultimately that Parliament is,27
NA,answerable to the people of this country,27
NA,for the policy of the Commonwealth,27
NA,Bank Board and for the actual effects,27
NA,of that policy in practice. This is why,27
NA,the Commonwealth Government has a,27
NA,"direct representative on the board, and",27
NA,it is also a reason why tbe Government,27
NA,"should play, not a dominating part, but",27
NA,"at least a strong part, in shaping the",27
NA,board's policy. I have viewed with con-,27
NA,siderable misgivings statements made by,27
NA,the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) in this,27
NA,"debate, concerning the circumstances sur-",27
NA,rounding the issue by the Commonwealth,27
NA,Bank Board of these treasury-bills. His,27
NA,statements indicate that the Government,27
NA,is not playing as strong a part as it,27
NA,sliould in moulding the policy of the,27
NA,board. Tbe Commonwealth Bank Board,27
NA,took an unprecedented step in making,28
NA,"this £1,000,000 worth, of treasury-bills",28
NA,available to the public.,28
Mr BEASLEY ,An d the issue is made,28
NA,to a limited section of the public only.,28
Mr JOHN LAWSON , I claim that,28
NA,the board has taken this action without,28
NA,having given any warning to the people,28
NA,"of Australia as to its intentions, despite",28
NA,the fact that the effect of its action has,28
NA,been to jolt the whole business and,28
NA,cial structure of the Commonwealth.,28
NA,"This action has put out of gear, tem-",28
NA,"porarily at any rate, the workings of the",28
NA,financial and business structure of tho,28
NA,"Commonwealth, and has created a posi-",28
NA,"tion which has given rise to statements,",28
NA,"vicious, malicious and otherwise; i t has",28
NA,created anxiety in the minds of the investanxiety,28
NA,"ing public and business people generally,",28
NA,and has generated an air of mystery in,28
NA,"regard to banking policy, which calls",28
NA,for some explanation. But we have,28
NA,had no such explanation. The crux of,28
NA,"the position is that, notwithstanding",28
NA,unprecedented action being taken by tbe,28
NA,Commonwealth Bank Board without any,28
NA,"warning to the people, and notwithstand-",28
NA,"ing its effect upon the public, parlia-",28
NA,"mentarians and business people generally,",28
NA,no attempt has been made by any mem-,28
NA,ber of the board to allay the resulting,28
NA,suspicion or anxiety or to explain the,28
NA,reasons for such a step. I suggest that,28
NA,in failing to explain its action the Com-,28
NA,monwealth Bank Board has acted unjustly,28
NA,towards the people of Australia.,28
NA,only explanation which has been forth-,28
NA,coming in regard to this matter has come,28
NA,from the Treasurer who said that he had,28
NA,no part whatever in formulating the,28
NA,"policy of the board, that he was in no way",28
NA,"responsible for its action, and, i n fact,",28
NA,that the motives of the board were no,28
NA,concern of his. This position indicates,28
NA,clearly that the Commonwealth Bank,28
NA,Board has been lacking in its duty,28
NA,towards both the Commonwealth Parlia-,28
NA,ment and the people of Australia.,28
Mr SCULLIN ,Doe s the honorable,28
NA,member know all the facts when he makes,28
NA,that statement?,28
Mr JOHN LAWSON ,Doe s any,28
NA,honorable member know all the facts?,28
Mr SCULLIN ,Th e honorable member,28
NA,should not condemn the other side until,28
NA,he has heard it. Probably upon analysis,28
NA,he would find that the Government was,28
NA,to blame.,28
Mr JOHN LAWSON , I am pre-,28
NA,pared to listen to the other side of the,28
NA,"matter, but I have made most determined",28
NA,"efforts to ascertain the facts, and have",28
NA,failed. I defy any member of this,28
NA,Parliament to say that he has had access,28
NA,to all of the facts.,28
Mr BEASLEY ,W e have not been,28
NA,finan- informed of any of the facts.,28
NA,Mr JOHN 'LAWSON -Tha t is the,28
NA,position. I criticize not the action of,28
NA,the Commonwealth Bank in issuing these,28
NA,"treasury-bills, but rather the failure of",28
NA,the bank to give any explanation of such,28
NA,"action, its failure to defend its position,",28
NA,or in any way to attempt to allay tbe,28
NA,and suspicion which its action has,28
NA,"aroused in the minds of the people, this,",28
NA,notwithstanding the fact that the bank,28
NA,board has been trenchantly criticized by,28
NA,bankers in all parts of Australia.,28
Mr SCULLIN ,Th e duty of the Com-,28
NA,this monwealth Bank Board is to give ita,28
NA,"explanation to the Government, and I",28
NA,think it has done it. I t is the Govern-,28
NA,ment that is at fault.,28
Mr JOHN LAWSON , I do not claim,28
NA,to be versed in the technique of these,28
NA,"matters, but I still hold the view that",28
NA,the bank board should have given some,28
NA,explanation. Whether it should be,28
NA,given by the chairman of the bank board,28
NA,or by the Treasurer is a technical issue.,28
NA,The whole thing resembles a mystery,28
NA,The drama in which the Commonwealth Bank,28
NA,Board plays the role of the sphinx; the,28
NA,"Treasurer that of the Delphic oracle,",28
NA,because any one of his statements is cap-,28
NA,able of a dozen different constructions;,28
NA,and the people of Australia and,28
NA,the members of this Parliament the,28
NA,role of Alice in Wonderland-wh o gaze,28
NA,in astonishment at a series of unpre-,28
NA,cedented phenomena without being able,28
NA,to understand them or get any explana-,28
NA,tion of them. I do not presume to,28
NA,criticize the action of the Commonwealth,28
NA,Bank Board i n issuing these treasury-,28
NA,"bills. Its action may be right or wrong,",28
NA,but that aspect of the matter is not so,28
NA,much the issue at stake as is the way in,28
NA,"which these treasury-bills were issued, and",28
NA,tbe motives which prompted the issue.,28
NA,One bank has already raised its deposit,28
NA,"rates, and other banks have announced",28
NA,that they propose to follow suit. The,29
NA,latest information I have received is to,29
NA,the effect that the associated banks,29
NA,are now following the lead given,29
NA,by the Bank of New South Wales.,29
NA,The danger inherent in such a policy is,29
NA,the inevitable tendency towards a higher,29
NA,"level of interest rates, and that I sug-",29
NA,"gest, is a matter in which this Parlia-",29
NA,ment is particularly interested. A review,29
NA,of the happenings of the last three or,29
NA,"four years shows unmistakably, that,",29
NA,"more than any other factor, the decline",29
NA,of interest rates has assisted i n the,29
NA,"recovery of governments and industry,",29
NA,i t is chiefly responsible for the present,29
NA,favorable budgetary position of almost,29
NA,"every government in the Commonwealth,",29
NA,and has been an essential factor in the,29
NA,smaller measure of recovery that has,29
NA,"taken place i n rural industry. Therefore,",29
NA,I say most emphatically that a con-,29
NA,tinuance of budget equilibrium of govern- per cent.,29
NA,"ments, and a steady expansion of indus-",29
NA,"try in Australia, thus ensuring a pro-",29
NA,gressive absorption of the unemployed in,29
NA,"primary and secondary industries,",29
NA,demand an immediate check to any ten-,29
NA,dency towards higher interest rates. We,29
NA,have a right to expect that either the,29
NA,Treasurer or the chairman of the Com-,29
NA,"monwealth Bank Board, whose ever",29
NA,"function i t may be, to make a public",29
NA,"statement assuring the people, that",29
NA,nothing will be done to encourage,29
NA,"another deflationary period, and that no",29
NA,action will be taken to bring about a,29
NA,further increase of interest rates.,29
NA,We have been adjured by several,29
NA,speakers on this side of the House to,29
NA,trust the Commonwealth Bank Board; to,29
NA,"rest assured that, in every aspect of its",29
NA,"policy, it is endeavouring to do its best",29
NA,for the people of Australia. I am quite,29
NA,willing to give to the board full credit,29
NA,for the undoubted services which it has,29
NA,"rendered to this country in the past, but",29
NA,"that does not mean that I must accept,",29
NA,"without criticism, any act of bank policy",29
NA,"which, in my opinion, may not be in the",29
NA,best interests of the people. We should,29
NA,not make the mistake of assuming that,29
NA,the record of the bank in the past will,29
NA,be the record of tbe bank in the future.,29
NA,"We must keep close watch on its policy,",29
NA,and consider the effect of its decisions,29
NA,"upou industry. Australian banks, in-",29
NA,"cluding the Commonwealth Bank, have",29
NA,not been over-generous to this Govern-,29
NA,ment or the people of Australia. Lei,29
NA,honorable members consider the interest,29
NA,rate on these treasury-bills. The Com-,29
NA,"monwealth Bank pays 1 per cent, for",29
NA,"three-months deposits, and charges the",29
NA,"Government l f per cent, for three-months",29
NA,treasury-bills. When the bank is a bor-,29
NA,"rower it pays 1 per cent., but when it is",29
NA,a lender it charges l f per cent. This,29
NA,"suggests that, after all, the Common-",29
NA,wealth Bank is not playing the part of,29
NA,financial fairy godmother to the Com-,29
NA,monwealth Government. One has only,29
NA,to examine the treasury-bill position in,29
NA,London to realize the truth of this state-,29
NA,"ment. On £30,000,000 worth of treasury-",29
NA,"bills in London, i t charges 2$ per cent.,",29
NA,"and on £3,250,000 worth of bills i t",29
NA,"charges l f per cent., whereas the London",29
NA,rate for British treasury-bills is l i s . 2d.,29
Mr BEASLEY ,A t one period it was,29
NA,down to 4s. per cent.,29
Mr JOHN LAWSON ,Thi s phase of,29
NA,the Commonwealth Bank's activities,29
NA,should be very closely examined. I t,29
NA,furnishes complete proof that the bank,29
NA,does not fix the rate of interest it charges,29
NA,according to the ruling rate of the day in,29
NA,the country in which it operates. I n,29
NA,determining our attitude to the board's,29
NA,"most recent action, we should consider",29
NA,carefully the effect of this issue of,29
NA,treasury-bills upon the general interest,29
NA,rate in Australia. Up to the present we,29
NA,have had no adequate explanation of the,29
NA,bank's attitude. What has happened,29
NA,justifies the suspicion or belief that the,29
NA,real purpose of the issue of these treasury-,29
NA,bills at the rate of interest stated is to,29
NA,"ensure a higher interest charge, thus",29
NA,checking government expenditure on pub-,29
NA,lic works and putting a brake on,29
NA,"the expansion of industry. I repeat,",29
NA,"therefore, that we should have a",29
NA,complete aud authoritative explanation,29
NA,"of the bank's attitude, because i f the",29
NA,"policy of the bank is to increase interest,",29
NA,rates and check government activity in,29
NA,"respect of works, i t constitutes a",29
NA,definite usurpation of the powers,29
NA,"and functions of this Parliament, and",29
NA,if it does that it invites coercive action by,29
NA,Parliament along the lines which we and,29
NA,the people generally have always,29
NA,regarded with abhorrence.,29
Sir FREDERICK STEWART ,Parra-,30
NA,matta) [4.44] -Muc h has already been,30
NA,said in the course of this discussion on,30
NA,the motion moved by the Leader of the,30
NA,"Opposition ( Mr Curtin), but I hope, by",30
NA,"endeavouring to avoid repetition, to keep",30
NA,myself within the brief time limit allowed,30
NA,by the Standing Orders. The motion,30
NA,charges the Government with having,30
NA,failed to exercise political prescience in,30
NA,anticipating the fluctuations of the Aus-,30
NA,"tralian cash balances in London, and",30
NA,with having failed to make pro-,30
NA,"vision, through its fiscal policy, to",30
NA,meet those fluctuations. I,30
NA,that the Prime Minister ( Mr Lyons),30
NA,dealt rather effectively with this aspect,30
NA,"of the case, although I have to con-",30
NA,"fess, with some reluctance, that there is",30
NA,room for considerable complaint regard-,30
NA,ing the variability of the explanations,30
NA,which have issued from official quarters,30
NA,on this subject during the last week or,30
NA,two. I welcome the opportunity which,30
NA,this motion gives the House to discuss,30
NA,this matter from another angle. My,30
NA,concern is with the possible effects on,30
NA,industry of the issue of treasury-bills by,30
NA,"tbe Commonwealth Bank, and the alleged",30
NA,motives for such action. I know that I,30
NA,shall probably be charged with merely,30
NA,repeating what a certain eminent ba.nker,30
NA,"has already said, but I do not mind telling",30
NA,"the House, that, before I left for England,",30
NA,"exactly twelve months ago to-day, I was",30
NA,not unaware of a developing political,30
NA,"psychology, which viewed with apprehen-",30
NA,sion a too rapid movement towards,30
NA,"industrial recovery in Australia, and I",30
NA,protested in the proper form against the,30
NA,continuance of that psychology. Un-,30
NA,doubtedly the continuance of this school,30
NA,of political thought gave rise to,30
NA,circumstances which made my position,30
NA,as Under-Secretary for Employment,30
NA,in this Government quite redundant.,30
NA,I have never been willing,30
NA,continue in any position once the savor,30
NA,of worthwhileness has departed from the,30
NA,job. My fear is that the improvement in,30
NA,the industrial situation from a most,30
NA,unsatisfactory position three or four years,30
NA,ago- a reduction from 30 per cent ratio,30
NA,of unemployed to 13.Y per cent -ha s,30
NA,tended to create an atmosphere of com-,30
NA,placency which is not justified by the cir-,30
NA,cumstances. There is room for consider-,30
NA,able satisfaction at the improvement,30
NA,"which has taken place, and I acknowledge",30
NA,"that this Government, perhaps more than",30
NA,"any other entity, has the right to feel",30
NA,"gratified, because I believe that by its",30
NA,general policy i t has played a not incon-,30
NA,sequential part in achieving this result.,30
NA,"But I do not forget, nor should other",30
NA,honorable members of this Parliament,30
NA,"forget, that even 13 per cent, of unem-",30
NA,"ployment means that 251,000 Australians",30
NA,are outlawed from industry.,30
Mr BEASLEY ,Ther e is also some,30
NA,doubt about the method by which those,30
NA,think figures were arrived at.,30
Sir FREDERICK STEWART ,,30
NA,"Whilst this state of affairs persists, I am",30
NA,not prepared to listen to any suggestion,30
NA,that our industrial machinery should,30
NA,be put into reverse gear. During,30
NA,"recent political campaigns, I did not",30
NA,hesitate to advocate that the hands,30
NA,of politicians should be kept off,30
NA,the banking institutions of this,30
NA,country. I have not changed my opinion,30
NA,in that regard. But this does not mean,30
NA,that we should regard all our banking,30
NA,institutions as impeccable and beyond the,30
NA,range of criticism. Nor does it mean,30
NA,that we should accept without complaint,30
NA,everything which they may do. I shall,30
NA,continue my confidence in the existing,30
NA,banking institutions only so long as I am,30
NA,satisfied that their policy is conducive to,30
NA,the best interests of the people of,30
NA,Australia.,30
NA,Let us examine some of the motives,30
NA,which might have actuated the Common-,30
NA,"wealth Bank Board in issuing £1,000,000",30
NA,"worth of treasury-bills. We can, I think,",30
NA,lightly dismiss any suggestion that the,30
NA,"bank was in need of £1,000,000, because",30
NA,that amount would be only so much small,30
NA,change to an institution dealing in the,30
NA,to volume' of finance handled by the board.,30
NA,The only explanation we have had is that,30
NA,"of the Treasurer ( Mr Casey), which I",30
NA,cannot accept. I cannot believe that tho,30
NA,object of the Commonwealth Bank Board,30
NA,in arranging for the issue to the public,30
NA,"of £1,000,000 worth of treasury-bills was",30
NA,to determine the reaction of investors to,30
NA,such a course. Is any experiment needed,30
NA,to ascertain whether investors desire a,30
NA,higher or lower rate of interest ? Does i t,30
NA,need any experiment to determine whether,30
NA,investors prefer the security offered by,30
NA,"any trading bank, however powerful i t",31
NA,"may be, in preference to a security which",31
NA,has the backing of the whole Common-,31
NA,"wealth, including that of tbe trading",31
NA,"banks, behind it? Does it need any ex-",31
NA,periment to ascertain whether those with,31
NA,"money available prefer an investment,",31
NA,the interest from which is partially free,31
NA,"of taxation, to one on which the profits",31
NA,are subject to full taxation? I cannot,31
NA,believe that is the true explanation of,31
NA,action taken by the Commonwealth Bank,31
NA,Board. The Treasurer must have,31
NA,thought that honorable members were a,31
NA,lot of dull school boys when he gave such,31
NA,an explanation to the House. I am,31
NA,strongly in favour of an open treasury-,31
NA,"bill market, and I cannot conceive the",31
NA,reasons actuating the representatives of,31
NA,the Commonwealth Government in oppos-,31
NA,ing the principle. I t has been stated,31
NA,that this is the. first instalment of the,31
NA,"principle of an open market, but we",31
NA,"know that it is not. Had it been, I",31
NA,should not have complained; my attitude,31
NA,would have been one of commendation.,31
NA,The honorable member for Macquarie,31
NA,( Mr John Lawson) has already referred,31
NA,to the fact that even in the issue of,31
NA,"sury-bills, a cardinal principle of money",31
NA,lending has been abrogated. A higher,31
NA,rate of interest is being offered on a,31
NA,better security. Those who know anything,31
NA,at all about money lending and banking,31
NA,principles have always understood that the,31
NA,better the security the lower is the rate,31
NA,of interest. The honorable member for,31
NA,Macquarie has also anticipated me some-,31
NA,what in directing attention to the fact,31
NA,that by charging the Commonwealth Go-,31
NA,"vernment l f per cent, for short-term",31
NA,"accommodation, the Comomnwealth Bank",31
NA,Board is actually charging more than tho,31
NA,prevailing rate on less attractive securi-,31
NA,ties. The Australian trading banks to-,31
NA,"day are holding £30,000,000 deposited.for",31
NA,three months at 1-j per cent. I f Aus-,31
NA,tralian investors are prepared to loan,31
NA,"money to trading banks, for short periods,",31
NA,"at 1$ per cent., it ought to be possible",31
NA,for the Commonwealth Government to,31
NA,receive an equally favorable rate. The,31
NA,-honorable member for Macquarie also,31
NA,referred to the position in Great Britain.,31
NA,I know it may be said that we cannot,31
NA,expect to achieve the same results in,31
NA,tralia as are obtained in tlie short-term,31
NA,"market in London. London, of course, is",31
NA,"the financial clearing house of the world,",31
NA,and as obviously large sums of money,31
NA,not required at the moment are invested,31
NA,in some form of security at a nominal,31
NA,rate of interest we cannot expect to,31
NA,obtain the same terms in Australia in,31
NA,respect of short-term borrowing. The,31
NA,Commonwealth Government is actually,31
NA,"paying £2.46 per cent, in London for",31
NA,"short-term accommodation, approximately",31
NA,the the figure which the Imperial Govern-,31
NA,ment is paying for long-term accommo-,31
NA,dation. Let us consider the position in,31
NA,London. Tor the eight weeks ended,31
NA,"the 31st January, the British Treasury-",31
NA,"offered, under a correctly designated open",31
NA,"treasury-bill market, treasury-bills to the",31
NA,"amount of £310,000,000. The amount",31
NA,"fluctuated between £35,000,000 and",31
NA,"£45,000,000 weekly; but the total for the",31
NA,"eight weeks was £310,000,000. The",31
NA,average rate of interest varied from,31
NA,"14s. 6d. per cent, down to 10s. 4.12d.",31
NA,"per cent., which was the rate dur-",31
NA,ing the last week in January. Not-,31
NA,withstanding the low rate-althoug h,31
NA,the Government required and accepted,31
NA,"only £310,000,000-investor s offered",31
NA,"trea- £559,000,000, or nearly twice the",31
NA,"amount required. I n eight weeks, the",31
NA,"British Treasury declined £249,000,000",31
NA,offered at rates between 10s. 4.12d. per,31
NA,"cent., and 14s. 6d. per cent., while, at",31
NA,"the same time, this Government is payiug",31
NA,£2.46 in the same market for short-term,31
NA,"accommodation on £33,000,000.",31
NA,As stated by the honorable member for,31
NA,"Macquarie, industrial recovery in Aus-",31
NA,tralia is closely related to interest,31
NA,"rates, not only for government borrow-",31
NA,"ing, but also for industrial borrowing.",31
NA,As the result of a compulsory reduction of,31
NA,"our internal debt in Australia, the budgets",31
NA,of the Commonwealth and of the States,31
NA,are benefiting to-day to the amount of,31
NA,"£6,500,000. We are also benefiting by",31
NA,"£3,500,000 as the result of the optional",31
NA,conversions in London. I ask honorable,31
NA,members what would be the position of,31
NA,the Commonwealth and of the State,31
NA,governments had they still to,31
NA,bear the burden of this additional,31
NA,"£10,000,000? As with governments, so",31
NA,with industry. No single factor has,31
NA,Aus- played such an important part in im-,31
NA,proving the industrial position in Aus-,31
NA,"tralia, and in diminishing the ratio of",31
NA,"unemployment, as has the availability of",32
NA,money at low interest rates. Yet we are,32
NA,expected to accept the dictum that,32
NA,interest rates must inevitably be in-,32
NA,creased. I am not prepared to do that.,32
NA,Our approach to the next depression will,32
NA,be at the turning point in the amount,32
NA,..which the investment of money returns.,32
NA,The hope was expressed by the honorable,32
NA,member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker),32
NA,"that, in view of the apprehension which",32
NA,"prevails, the Commonwealth Bank will",32
NA,take adequate steps to prevent injury,32
NA,being done to Australian industry or other,32
NA,interests. The Prime Minister informed,32
NA,us that the Government would watch,32
NA,the position closely with a similar,32
NA,end in view. I trust that it will do so.,32
NA,Others will also be watching the position,32
NA,"anxiously, not the least of whom",32
NA,are those who have suffered,32
NA,mental and physical deprivation asso-,32
NA,ciated with continued unemployment.,32
NA,I f honorable members did not occupy the,32
NA,time of the House for longer periods than,32
NA,"I do, Parliament would not have to meet",32
NA,"in Canberra for lengthy periods, and the",32
NA,responsibility of the Minister for the,32
NA,NA,32
NA,tions would be reduced. I find no parti-,32
NA,"cular exhilaration in speaking as I do,",32
NA,but it is necessary to remind some,32
NA,important members of the Government of,32
NA,"tbe definite, clear, and unequivocal obli-",32
NA,gation which the Government assumed,32
NA,"when, at the commencement of the session,",32
NA,it promised to place at the forefront,32
NA,of its policy-pre-eminen t over every,32
NA,other governmental activity-a n effort to,32
NA,relieve the industrial position. I accept,32
NA,the Prime Minister's assurance given,32
NA,yesterday that the Government will,32
NA,adhere to the policy submitted to the,32
NA,"people. So long as it does so, i t will",32
NA,"my loyal and, I trust, constructive sup-",32
NA,port; but i f the time should come when,32
NA,I have to decide between loyalty to any,32
NA,party and loyalty to the distressed mem-,32
NA,"bers of this community, I shall not",32
NA,hesitate to take such steps as I consider,32
NA,uecessary to protect the interests of the,32
NA,people.,32
Mr BEASLEY ,West Sydney) [5.2].,32
NA,-Th e debate on this subject has,32
NA,developed in such a way that the state-,32
NA,ment of the Minister for the Interior,32
NA,NA,32
NA,by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr.,32
NA,Curtin) has fallen flat cannot possibly be,32
NA,"substantiated, particularly in view of the",32
NA,utterances of the last two speakers.,32
NA,Already four Ministers have participated,32
NA,"in the debate, in an endeavour to explain",32
NA,the position confronting the Government.,32
NA,Every honorable member on this side of,32
NA,the House has waited patiently in an,32
NA,endeavour to ascertain the reasons which,32
NA,actuated the Commonwealth Bank,32
NA,Board in the policy in which it has,32
NA,"adopted, and it is quite obvious that at",32
NA,least two supporters of the Government,32
NA,have waited with equal patience. They,32
NA,"are disappointed just as we are, and we",32
NA,demand that the facts shall be placed,32
NA,before Parliament and the people. The,32
NA,honorable member for Parramatta ( Sir,32
NA,Frederick Stewart) has voiced public,32
NA,opinion on this subject. Every impartial,32
NA,observation made by the press on the,32
NA,subject coincides with the views expressed,32
NA,"by the honorable member, and it will be",32
NA,in the best interests of the Commonwealth,32
NA,if this debate is continued in an endea-,32
NA,vour to force the Grovernment to declare,32
NA,the motive behind the board's 'action. I,32
NA,suppose it is unnecessary for me to say,32
NA,that on previous occasions honorable,32
NA,members on this side of the chamber have,32
NA,expressed their opinion clearly on an open,32
NA,"market for treasury-bills. Some time ago,",32
NA,"I believe in March of last year, I either",32
NA,moved the adjournment of the House or,32
NA,dealt with this subject by a specific,32
NA,motion. The issue of treasury-bills to,32
NA,private banks is the greatest financial,32
NA,racket ever put over the country.,32
NA,There is little need for me to go into,32
NA,details to prove our contention that these,32
NA,treasury-bills were issued exclusively to,32
NA,the private banks to enable them to turn,32
NA,their cash reserves into even more advan-,32
NA,have tageous profit-making propositions than,32
NA,were already open to them. As has been,32
NA,"already stated during this debate,",32
NA,treasury-bills have been issued in the past,32
NA,at a rate as high as 6 per cent. Later,32
NA,the rate dropped to 4 per cent.,32
NA,I n the ordinary process of financial,32
NA,dealings the banks are able to mul-,32
NA,tiply their reserves by anything,32
NA,from seven to nine times; but by dealing,32
NA,in these treasury-bills they have had,32
NA,an additional avenue of profit opened up,32
NA,"to them, and they know very well that",32
NA,the bills can be discounted within three,32
NA,months by application to the Connmon-,33
NA,wealth Bank Board. I n view of all the,33
NA,circumstances of the case every impartial,33
NA,observer must conclude that there is some,33
NA,close connexion between the Common-,33
NA,wealth Bank Board and the private bank-,33
NA,ing institutions in these transactions.,33
NA,Why should the Commonwealth Bank,33
NA,Board extend this concession exclusively,33
NA,to the private banks? What right have,33
NA,tbe private banks to profit by a set of,33
NA,circumstances not available to other,33
NA,financial institutions? Why should they,33
NA,be allowed to extract greater profits than,33
NA,are reasonable from their dealings?,33
NA,Because the issue of treasury-bills under,33
NA,the processes now operating gives the pri-,33
NA,v vate banks an exclusive opportunity to,33
NA,"increase their returns, we contend that",33
NA,we are justified in reiterating that there,33
NA,is collusion between them and the Com-,33
NA,monwealth Bank Board.,33
NA,"Earlier, when we discussed the prin-",33
NA,ciple of issuing treasury-bills upon the,33
NA,"open market, we had in mind always that",33
NA,the procedure followed in Great Britain,33
NA,in this regard would be observed,33
NA,in Australia. I t is well known that,33
NA,at one stage treasury-bills were,33
NA,tendered for upon the open market,33
NA,in Great Britain at 4s. l i d . per,33
NA,"cent., and the issue was over-subscribed.",33
NA,"Subsequently, the rate of interest rose",33
NA,to l i s . per cent. The information which,33
NA,the honorable member for Parramatta,33
NA,( Sir Frederick Stewart) has also provided,33
NA,us with this afternoon on this subject is,33
NA,"most illuminating, particularly having",33
NA,regard to the circumstances governing,33
NA,Australia's overseas indebtedness. I have,33
NA,"had prepared, but unfortunately have not",33
NA,"at my hand at the moment, a table setting",33
NA,out the conditions under which various,33
NA,conversions have been made in Great,33
NA,"Britain on behalf of Australia, the other",33
NA,"British dominions, and certain foreign",33
NA,"countries, and this showed beyond all",33
NA,"question that Australia, had been called",33
NA,upon to pay a higher rate of interest than,33
NA,"other British dominions, and even some",33
NA,"foreign countries, including the ex-enemy",33
NA,"country, Austria.",33
NA,"We have heard a good deal lately, par-",33
NA,ticularly from the Treasurer ( Mr.,33
NA,"Casey), about the beneficial result of the",33
NA,"restoration of confidence in Australia,",33
NA,it appears to me that confidence has only,33
NA,been restored in such a manner as to pro-,33
NA,vide those who dabble in Australian,33
NA,securities overseas with a definite oppor-,33
NA,tunity to exploit this country. What has,33
NA,happened lays open to serious question,33
NA,the operations that have been conducted,33
NA,in London recently by Australia's repre-,33
NA,sentative there.,33
NA,"Previously, when it has been suggested",33
NA,that treasury-bills should be placed on,33
NA,"the open market in Australia, those who",33
NA,advocated that course did not contemplate,33
NA,that the Commonwealth Bank Board,33
NA,would fix a definite rate of interest. I t,33
NA,was expected that the bills would be,33
NA,"marketed, as in Great Britain, on a com-",33
NA,petitive basis. Those who applied for,33
NA,them would be invited to indicate the rate,33
NA,of interest they were willing to pay.,33
Sir FREDERICK STEWART ,Tha t is,33
NA,"what ought to have been done, and what",33
NA,was expected.,33
Mr HUTCHINSON ,Bu t have we finan-,33
NA,cial institutions in Australia that can be,33
NA,compared with those of Great Britain?,33
Mr BEASLEY ,Bearin g in mind,33
NA,"the amount of money available here, I",33
NA,submit that we have. I t was never con-,33
NA,templated that the Commonwealth Bank,33
NA,"would fix the rate of interest. However,",33
NA,neither the honorable member for Indi,33
NA,"( Mr Hutchinson), nor I , can say what",33
NA,would happen i f treasury-bills were,33
NA,offered on an open market. The only,33
NA,logical thing to do is to test the market on,33
NA,a competitive basis. Until that is done,33
NA,no one can tell what the result will be.,33
Mr SCULLIN ,Wha t the bank has,33
NA,done will not test the market at all.,33
Mr BEASLEY ,Tha t is so. The,33
NA,fixing of the rate of interest precludes,33
NA,the making of any real test. During the,33
NA,early proceedings before the Boyal Com-,33
NA,mission on Banking and Monetary,33
NA,Reform indications were given that some,33
NA,of the big insurance companies desired an,33
NA,opportunity to invest a certain propor-,33
NA,"tion of their funds in treasury^bills, but",33
NA,the action of the Commonwealth Bank,33
NA,Board in fixing the rate of interest has re-,33
NA,moved the competition that would have,33
NA,"but arisen from these sources. I believe that,",33
NA,if treasury^bills were offered on a competi-,34
NA,"tive basis, a number of financial institu-",34
NA,tions other than banks would be likely,34
NA,to invest some of their funds in them.,34
NA,"After all, such security is .the best that",34
NA,can be obtained by any investing,34
NA,"authority. Unfortunately, the competi-",34
NA,tive aspect seems to have been entirely,34
NA,overlooked or deliberately avoided by,34
NA,the Commonwealth Bank Board. I t,34
NA,is also regrettable that other con-,34
NA,ditions governing the issue of the bills,34
NA,will make it impossible for other than,34
NA,a very few institutions to apply for them.,34
NA,The minimum amount of any application,34
NA,"is £10,000. The bills are to be issued in",34
NA,"denominations of £5,000, but tho mini-",34
NA,mum amount that may be allotted to any,34
NA,"one applicant is £10,000. Why should",34
NA,such a high limit be placed upon the dis-,34
NA,tribution of these bills ? Why should not,34
NA,persons who have even £500 to invest be,34
NA,entitled to make an application for bills,34
NA,to that value? I can see no justification,34
NA,whatever for the fixing of such a high,34
NA,"minimiun as £10,000.",34
NA,Although this motion has been under,34
NA,discussion for two days and four Minis-,34
NA,"ters have spoken to it, we have not yet",34
NA,been given any answer to our earnest in-,34
NA,quiry as to the reasons which have,34
NA,actuated the bank in adopting this new,34
NA,procedure. This must be regarded as an,34
NA,amazing situation by honorable members,34
NA,irrespective of their political allegiances.,34
NA,The Leader of the Opposition was forced,34
NA,to submit his case under very unfavorable,34
NA,"circumstances, for he was not able to",34
NA,obtain statistical information covering,34
NA,even the first two months of this year.,34
NA,He had to rely on data covering the,34
NA,period up to the end of December. I,34
NA,submit that information covering the,34
NA,period to at least the end of February,34
NA,"sliould have been available. However, the",34
NA,honorable gentleman made a very exact,34
NA,analysis of the figures that were weakness ?,34
NA,available.,34
Sir HENRY GULLETT ,H e had exact,34
NA,"figures, and that is the knockout.",34
Mr BEASLEY ,Th e Leader of the,34
NA,Opposition was definitely handicapped,34
NA,stating his case by reason of the fact,34
NA,he could not obtain recent information.,34
NA,The honorable gentleman has charged,34
NA,"Government with "" failing to take action",34
NA,to safeguard Australia's oversea funds,34
NA,checking the increasing flow of unneces-,34
NA,"sary imports "". From all that has hap-",34
NA,"pened, we are forced to the conclusion",34
NA,that the action of the Commonwealth,34
NA,Bank Board in fixing the interest rate on,34
NA,these treasury-bills was not designed to,34
NA,"test the market, or to discover whether",34
NA,this form of monetary policy was or was,34
NA,not acceptable to the Australian public.,34
NA,We believe that the action was taken,34
NA,for the express purpose of doing some-,34
NA,"thing which tbe Government, as a Go-",34
NA,"vernment, had failed to do or which it",34
NA,was unable to do because of the conflicting,34
NA,political interests represented within it.,34
NA,I t is useless for any Minister to tell us,34
NA,that the Government is unaware of the,34
NA,reasons which actuated the Common-,34
NA,wealth Bank Board in taking this action.,34
NA,We believe that the board acted as it did,34
NA,in order to l i f t the responsibility from,34
NA,the shoulders of the Government for tak-,34
NA,"ing an action which, in the light of its",34
NA,"policy of tariff slashing, must be unpalat-",34
NA,able. This action is really a subterfuge.,34
NA,I t is a method of doing something which,34
NA,the Government should have done in,34
NA,another way. I t was enlightening to hear,34
NA,the honorable member for Parramatta,34
NA,say this afternoon that he did not believe,34
NA,the Treasurer had stated what he,34
NA,considered to be the reasons why,34
NA,the Commonwealth Bank Board had,34
NA,issued these treasury-bills. Nothing,34
NA,could have been more definite than the,34
NA,"statement of the honorable member, who",34
NA,spoke as an ex-Minister of this Govern-,34
NA,ment and also as a gentleman closely asso-,34
NA,ciated with the business life of Australia.,34
NA,He is known far and wide and his views,34
NA,on this subject will undoubtedly carry a,34
NA,good deal of weight throughout the,34
NA,country.,34
Sir HENRY GULLETT ,I s the Opposi-,34
NA,tion borrowing strength from this side of,34
NA,the chamber because it knows its own,34
Mr BEASLEY ,Ou r contention is,34
NA,that the Government knows exactly why,34
NA,these treasury-bills are to be issued in,34
NA,this way. I t is taking refuge behind the,34
NA,in Commonwealth Bank Board because it is,34
NA,that tied to a freetrade element within the,34
NA,"Cabinet, and also to certain interests",34
NA,"the associated with the Ottawa decisions,",34
NA,which have forced an import situation,34
NA,by upon Australia which is compelling the,34
NA,country to face a state of affairs that,35
NA,"mean, before very long, a reversal of Go-",35
NA,vernment policy. Actually the situation,35
NA,is getting beyond the control of the Go-,35
NA,vernment. The action of the Common-,35
NA,"wealth Bank Board has been taken, in",35
NA,"our opinion, to enable the Government to",35
NA,avoid the necessity for having to make a,35
NA,volte-face upon its own policy. I t is for,35
NA,this reason that the Commonwealth Bank,35
NA,Board is issuing these treasury-bills at a,35
NA,fixed rate of interest and distributing,35
NA,them to a very limited constituency.,35
NA,I n tlic circumstances that face us it,35
NA,is as well to bear in mind that the,35
NA,national debt of Australia has increased,35
NA,"since 1931 by £86,000,000. The debt per",35
NA,head of the population has advanced from,35
NA,£177 2s. 3d. to £1S4 14s.. This increase,35
NA,of £6 l i s . 9d. per head of the population,35
NA,"is very serious. How, in the face of it,",35
NA,can honorable gentlemen opposite talk,35
NA,about the return of prosperity or the,35
NA,restoration of confidence? Even i f they,35
NA,"laugh off such a serious state of affairs,",35
NA,they may be very sure that the general,35
NA,public will not laugh it off when made,35
NA,acquainted with the facts.,35
NA,"We have grave reason to complain, too,",35
NA,of the accuracy of certain statistical in-,35
NA,formation wliich was used by the Prime,35
NA,Minister yesterday. The right honorable,35
NA,gentleman told us that the unemployment,35
NA,figure in Now South Wales as present is,35
NA,only 8 per cent. I f he knew the situation,35
NA,in New South Wales as some of us know,35
NA,"it, he would not attempt to bolster up a",35
NA,bad case by such figures. I n view of our,35
NA,knowledge of the unemployment situation,35
NA,in New South Wales we are forced to,35
NA,question the accuracy of the right honor-,35
NA,able gentleman's figures in this regard,35
NA,"and, i f in this regard, in others also.",35
NA,"There has, of course, been consultation",35
NA,between the Commonwealth Bank Board,35
NA,and the Government in regard to these,35
NA,treasury-bills. There can be no question,35
NA,at all about that. I believe that the Trea-,35
NA,surer went further than he intended to go,35
NA,yesterday in the earlier part of his speech,35
NA,when he admitted that there had been,35
NA,close collaboration between himself and,35
NA,the Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank,35
NA,Board. The chairman of the board,35
NA,"acted, apparently, as an intermediary",35
NA,between the board and the Government.,35
NA,"The Treasurer further said that, regard-",35
NA,will ing matters which he considered to be of,35
NA,"minor importance, he did not advise the",35
NA,"Cabinet, but that the more important",35
NA,aspects were considered by members of the,35
NA,Government. I think it is safe to say that,35
NA,some of the Ministers know nothing what-,35
NA,"ever about this matter, and the Minister",35
NA,in charge of negotiations for trade,35
NA,"treaties ( Sir Henry Gullett), who",35
NA,"laughs loudest, probably knows least.",35
NA,While I am on the subject of that Minis-,35
NA,"ter, let me inform honorable members",35
NA,what that gentleman stated the other day,35
NA,when speaking to the members of the,35
NA,Coburg Men's Club in Victoria. He,35
NA,said-,35
NA,The people sliould wipe the bogey of depres-,35
NA,"sion out of their minds, and realize that Aus-",35
NA,tralia is in an extremely prosperous position.,35
NA,I intend to get thousands of copies of,35
NA,"that statement printed, and every week,",35
NA,"when unemployed men, whose social bene-",35
NA,"fits have been reduced, come to me for",35
NA,"help, I shall hand them a copy, and tell",35
NA,them to laugh off their troubles. I shall,35
NA,"remind them that, in the words of the",35
NA,"Minister, they are "" extremely pros-",35
NA,"perous "".",35
NA,The Leader of the Opposition pointed,35
NA,"out that the Government, though i t",35
NA,realized that the financial position over-,35
NA,"seas was becoming precarious, was unable",35
NA,to take the necessary action to put matters,35
NA,"right because, through its alliance with",35
NA,"the Country party, it was debarred from",35
NA,limiting importations by tariff adjust-,35
NA,"ments. Therefore, in collaboration with",35
NA,"the Commonwealth Bank, it adopted the",35
NA,alternative course of making money,35
NA,dearer in an endeavour to restrict the,35
NA,operations of importers.,35
NA,I t is evident that there was collusion,35
NA,between the Commonwealth Bank Board,35
NA,and tbe private banks over the issue of,35
NA,treasury-bills. I t was altogether im-,35
NA,proper that the private banks should be,35
NA,given the opportunity to make profits,35
NA,"out of treasury-bills, especially as they",35
NA,"received 4 per cent, for the accommo-",35
NA,"dation they provided, when similar bills",35
NA,were being taken up on the open market,35
NA,in London for l i s . The Treasurer stated,35
NA,that the Commonwealth Bank rate of,35
NA,"interest for deposits was \ per cent,",35
NA,lower than the rate offered by trading,35
NA,"banks, and he said that there was no",35
NA,"squeal about that. There was no squeal,",35
NA,because tbe arrangement was eminently,36
NA,suitable to the private banks. The Com-,36
NA,monwealth Bank has never set out to be,36
NA,a serious competitor of the private banks.,36
NA,Any manager of a country branch of the,36
NA,Commonwealth Bank will say that he,36
NA,has been advised not to seek country,36
NA,business in the way of making advances,36
NA,"to agriculturists or pastoralists, but to",36
NA,allow that business to be done by the,36
NA,private banks. Since the rate of interest,36
NA,for treasury-bills to be offered on the,36
NA,"market was fixed, one private bank has",36
NA,"raised the rate of interest on deposits,",36
NA,and now it is stated that all the other,36
NA,associated banks have fallen into line.,36
NA,"Before long, no doubt, the Commonwealth",36
NA,Bank will also raise its rate. This may,36
NA,check the operations of importers to some,36
NA,"extent, but it will also retard the developorable",36
NA,"ment of our secondary industries, and",36
NA,will make it even more difficult for the,36
NA,primary producers to carry on. Very,36
NA,"few primary producers are free of debt,",36
NA,and hardly any of them can extend their,36
NA,operations without financial accommoda-,36
NA,tion from the banks. The members of,36
NA,this party are convinced either that the,36
NA,majority of the members of the Govern-,36
NA,ment were unaware of what was being,36
NA,"done in connexion with the treasury-bills,",36
NA,or that the Government has refused to,36
NA,reveal the real motive behind the trans-,36
NA,action. It is evident that consultations,36
NA,took place between the Commonwealth,36
NA,Bank Board and some members of the,36
NA,"Government, so that it is idle to pretend",36
NA,that the Commonwealth Bank Board has,36
NA,been entirely free of political influence.,36
NA,"No doubt, if the facts are ever revealed,",36
NA,the public will learn that the Government,36
NA,was warned more than once by the Com-,36
NA,monwealth Bank Board that the financial,36
NA,position overseas was unsound.,36
NA,"Government, however, refused to meet the",36
NA,"situation in the ordinary way, because",36
NA,the only effective method of doing so,36
NA,would be to take the same action as the,36
NA,Scullin Government took on a previous,36
NA,"occasion, ancl then it would have been",36
NA,reminded of the things its members had,36
NA,said of the Scullin Government at that,36
NA,time. It is perhaps good to inform some,36
NA,"honorable members opposite, who have",36
NA,only recently entered this House of what,36
NA,occurred in 192S and what led up to those,36
NA,occurrences. The Minister in charge,36
NA,Mr Beasley.,36
NA,of negotiations for trade treaties was,36
NA,a member of the Bruce-Page Govern-,36
NA,"ment which, for years prior to 1928, had",36
NA,pursued a policy that finally landed Aus-,36
NA,tralia in the position from which the,36
NA,Scullin Government had to extricate i t .,36
NA,The chairman of the Commonwealth,36
NA,Bank repeatedly warned the Bruce-Page,36
NA,Government of the unsound financial,36
NA,position into which the country was drift-,36
NA,"ing, but no action was taken by that Go-",36
NA,open vernment. I am convinced that there is,36
NA,no truth in the statement that these,36
NA,treasury-bills have been offered at the,36
NA,present time for the purpose of testing,36
NA,the market. Any statement to that effect,36
NA,is mere hypocrisy. The Opposition is,36
NA,"well aware of this, and that is why tho",36
NA,present motion was moved. Even hon-,36
NA,"members opposite, i f they view the",36
NA,"matter impartially, and decline to be",36
NA,influenced by the special pleading of,36
NA,"Ministers, must realize the seriousness of",36
NA,the situation. They should pay some,36
NA,heed to what responsible authorities out-,36
NA,side Parliament are saying. I am con,36
NA,vinced that i f this motion is not carried,36
NA,"by the House, it will, before very long,",36
NA,receive the unqualified endorsement of the,36
NA,public.,36
Mr FAIRBAIRN ,Flinders) [5.33] -,36
NA,I am afraid that I ca.nnot offer honorable,36
NA,members anything in the way of excite-,36
NA,ment and entertainment such as has been,36
NA,given by the honorable member for West,36
NA,Sydney ( Mr Beasley) i n his excellent,36
NA,"speech-excellent , that is, as an enter-",36
NA,tainment. Some matters which have,36
NA,been brought up during the course of this,36
NA,debate are deserving of further attention,36
NA,and dispassionate discussion. The first,36
NA,part of the motion of censure chides the,36
NA,The Government for not havinsr undertaken to,36
NA,dictate the policy of the Commonwealth,36
NA,Bank. During the last two elections the,36
NA,Government gave an undertaking to the,36
NA,people that it would not tamper with the,36
NA,"monetary system of Australia, and on",36
NA,that undertaking it was re-elected. There-,36
NA,"fore, for members on this side of the",36
NA,House to round on the Government,36
NA,because it has adhered to a policy on,36
NA,which it was elected is astounding.,36
NA,That honorable members opposite should,36
NA,"criticize the Government is only natural,",36
NA,and in accordance with their expressed,36
NA,intention during the election campaign.,36
Sir FREDERICK STEWART , I am,37
NA,prepared to be a party back.,37
Mr FAIRBAIRN ,Durin g tbe last,37
NA,two election campaigns honorable mem-,37
NA,bers opposite said frankly and unmistake-,37
NA,ably that they stood for an alteration of,37
NA,"the financial system, and complete control",37
NA,of banking by the Government. Tbat,37
NA,"point I do not wish to discuss further,",37
NA,because I consider that the Government,37
NA,would be failing in its trust i f it went,37
NA,back on its pledge to the electors and,37
NA,departed from the policy on wliich it,37
NA,was returned to power with such a sub-,37
NA,stantial majority.,37
NA,The second point i n the speech of the,37
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin),37
NA,dealt with what he described as the failure,37
NA,of the Government to check the alarming,37
NA,position in relation to the balance of,37
NA,trade. Since the Prime Minister ( Mr.,37
NA,Lyons) has given to the House figures,37
NA,which were not available to the Leader,37
NA,of the Opposition when he prepared his,37
NA,"speech, I shall not endeavour to make",37
NA,capital out of the remarks of the honor-,37
NA,"able gentleman, because to do so would",37
NA,be to take an unfair advantage of him.,37
NA,"There are, however, other points to",37
NA,"which I desire to refer. First, there is",37
NA,the fact referred to by the Treasurer,37
NA,"( Mr Casey), that honorable members on",37
NA,both sides of the House are inclined to,37
NA,exaggerate the deflationary effect of the,37
NA,action of the Commonwealth Bank Board,37
NA,in making available to financial institu-,37
NA,tions other than the trading banks,37
NA,"treasury-bills to the value of £1,000,000.",37
NA,Tbe Treasurer pointed out clearly that,37
NA,that sum represents only one-thirtieth,37
NA,of the amount of money on fixed deposit,37
NA,"for a term of three months, not",37
NA,to mention money on deposit for,37
NA,"six, nine, twelve or 24 - months. That",37
NA,"there is approximately £30,000,000 in-",37
NA,vested with the trading banks on three-,37
NA,"month terms, means that about £1,000,000",37
NA,is deposited at fixed rates with them,37
NA,"about every three days. I t will be seen,",37
NA,"therefore, that of itself this experimental",37
NA,"issue of £1,000,000 of treasury-bills gives",37
NA,to the trading banks very little real cause,37
NA,for increasing their interest rate.,37
NA,issue of treasury-bills is only one of many,37
NA,ways in which the Commonwealth Bank,37
NA,can control interest rates. This issue,37
NA,means that the Commonwealth Bank will,37
NA,"not obtain £1,000,000 from investors who",37
NA,otherwise might have invested their,37
NA,money with the trading banks on fixed,37
NA,"deposit. The Commonwealth Bank, how-",37
NA,"ever, can use that £1,000,000 in ways",37
NA,which will counteract the effect of the,37
NA,increased interest rate. I want to make,37
NA,"clear that, although a return to higher",37
NA,interest rates has been precipitated by this,37
NA,"issue of treasury-bills, the major respon-",37
NA,sibility does not rest with the Common-,37
NA,wealth Bank Board. Every person who,37
NA,has taken any interest in business affairs,37
NA,"in Australia during recent months, as",37
NA,"either a borrower or a lender, has been",37
NA,aware that the law of supply and demand,37
NA,would result in interest rates rising soon,37
NA,"-possibl y within four or five months, or,",37
NA,"it may be, not for twelve months.",37
Mr JOHN LAWSON ,Should the Com-,37
NA,monwealth Bank precipitate that rise?,37
Mr FAIRBAIRN ,Th e Common-,37
NA,wealth Bank has not started the move-,37
NA,ment towards increased interest rates.,37
Mr JOHN LAWSON ,Bu t i t is doing its,37
NA,best to help in that direction.,37
Mr FAIRBAIRN ,Ever y one who,37
NA,has seen a mortgage drawn within the,37
NA,last few months is aware that the,37
NA,borrower has endeavoured to get the,37
NA,longest term possible and the lender,37
NA,the shortest term. Both borrowers and,37
NA,"lenders know that, by the law of supply",37
NA,"and demand, interest rates must inevit-",37
NA,ably rise soon.,37
Sir FREDERICK STEWART ,Doe s not,37
NA,"that argument apply also to wheat, butter",37
NA,and sugar?,37
Mr FAIRBAIRN ,Th e responsible,37
NA,members of the Opposition have frankly,37
NA,admitted that for some time Australia has,37
NA,been heading towards higher interest,37
NA,rates. During this debate they have not,37
NA,denied that tendency; they have merely,37
NA,contended that this action on the part of,37
NA,the Commonwealth Bank Board has pre-,37
NA,cipitated a rise. I suggest that the,37
NA,"responsible party is, not the Common-",37
NA,"wealth Bank Board, but a certain indi-",37
NA,vidual in charge of an institution which,37
NA,wishes to make capital out of the ten-,37
NA,dency towards higher interest rates. I,37
NA,The do not think that any one who considers,37
NA,this subject can honestly say that this,37
NA,issue of treasury-bills by the Common-,37
NA,"wealth Bank Board could, of itself, have",37
NA,"any appreciable effect on interest rates,",37
NA,especially as it was obvious tbat a,38
NA,majority of the trading banks did not,38
NA,intend to increase their fixed deposit,38
NA,immediately. To me it is most distaste-,38
NA,f ul to criticize in public any individual,38
NA,"or institution, but I suggest, with all",38
NA,"diffidence, that a certain individual who",38
NA,is at the head of a private trading bank is,38
NA,primarily responsible for precipitating the,38
NA,rise of interest rates which for some time,38
NA,has been threatening. I t is well,38
NA,"the members of this House, and the",38
NA,"people of Australia, should realize that",38
NA,the man who has used this issue of,38
NA,treasury-bills as an excuse for endeavour-,38
NA,ing to gain a trading advantage over hia,38
NA,competitors is the individual who for,38
NA,"some time, with no false modesty, has held",38
NA,himself up as the apostle of cheap money,38
NA,"in Australia. I n spite of this, and",38
NA,knowing that higher interest rates,38
NA,are bound to come as a result of the appli-,38
NA,"cation of tbe law of supply and demand,",38
NA,he has used the action of the Common-,38
NA,wealth Bank as a smoke screen behind,38
NA,which he has endeavoured to gain a trade,38
NA,"advantage over his rivals. As I have said,",38
NA,such references are most distasteful to,38
NA,"me; but, in fairness to the Commonwealth",38
NA,"Bank Board, whose reputation is of vital",38
NA,"importance to the people of Australia, I",38
NA,cannot emphasize the facts too strongly.,38
NA,The work commenced by the indi-,38
NA,vidual referred to is being furthered,38
NA,in this House by those who say,38
NA,that an era of dearer money has,38
NA,"been thrust upon us. Naturally, after",38
NA,the eloquent speeches delivered this after- lic interests.,38
NA,noon by honorable members on both sides,38
NA,"of the House, investors will approach the",38
NA,managers of other banks and ask for the,38
NA,higher rate of interest which is being paid,38
NA,"by the Bank of New South ""Wales. For",38
NA,"fear of losing customers, the other trading",38
NA,banks will be forced to fall into line.,38
Mr JOHN LAWSON ,Tbe y are already,38
NA,falling into line.,38
Mr FAIRBAIRN ,I t is to their,38
NA,credit that they were not stampeded into,38
NA,immediately declaring higher rates. They,38
NA,have delayed several days since one,38
NA,bank took advantage of the existing,38
NA,circumstances to gain a trade advan-,38
NA,tage over them. I pass on to the,38
NA,service rendered yesterday by tha,38
NA,honorable member for Griffith ( Mr.,38
NA,Baker) when he drew attention to the,38
NA,high qualifications of certain members of,38
NA,the Commonwealth Bank Board. I can-,38
NA,rates not understand why he omitted to men-,38
NA,tion one other member of that board,38
NA,- a man who has been closely associated,38
NA,"with organized Labour. During his speech,",38
NA,"the honorable member paused to remark,",38
NA,NA,38
NA,appointed to the Commonwealth Bank,38
NA,Board because of his great knowledge of,38
NA,"that the grazing industry, was probably the",38
NA,most successful grazier in Queensland.,38
NA,"Starting more or less from scratch, Mr.",38
NA,"Tait has become a successful grazier, who",38
NA,"has earned the respect and confidence of,",38
NA,"not only the graziers of Queensland, but",38
NA,"also, I venture to suggest, more employees",38
NA,in the grazing industry than perhaps any,38
NA,other grazier in that State. Yet the hon-,38
NA,orable member criticized his appointment.,38
NA,I can only suggest that his judgment as to,38
NA,who are suitable persons to control the,38
NA,Commonwealth Bank is on a par with,38
NA,his knowledge of seasonal conditions in,38
NA,"Australia, as exemplified when he des-",38
NA,cribed a cycle of droughty conditions as a,38
NA,series of fortuitously good seasons. I t is,38
NA,not to be wondered at in those circum-,38
NA,stances that he should consider that at,38

NA,The honorable member said that he did,38
NA,not mind members of the board having,38
NA,business experience.,38
Mr BAKER , I object to their having,38
NA,private interests which conflict with pub-,38
Mr FAIRBAIRN , I do not know,38
NA,how any one could have business experi-,38
NA,ence without having business interests.,38
NA,I should like the honorable member for,38
NA,Griffith ( Mr Baker) at some future date,38
NA,to explain how it is possible to have,38
NA,experience of business without having,38
NA,association with it.,38
NA,The Leader of the Opposition com-,38
NA,plained that the volume of purchases,38
NA,from abroad had grown alarmingly and,38
NA,that the Government should have taken,38
NA,steps to check it. The figures made,38
NA,available to the honorable member since,38
NA,his speech must have convinced him that,38
NA,the position is not so alarming as he,38
NA,"thought it was, but I consider that",38
NA,the source of much of our pur-,38
NA,chases from abroad gives cause for great,38
NA,alarm. One of the very large items,39
NA,referred to is motor vehicles. What I,39
NA,consider as alarming is that the big in-,39
NA,"crease in our purchases of motor vehicles,",39
NA,"should for the most part, be from",39
NA,the country that is our worst cus-,39
NA,tomer. The Leader of the Opposi-,39
NA,tion would therefore have been well justi-,39
NA,fied in asking the Government what it,39
NA,intended to do to check this most alarm-,39
NA,ing tendency. While I do not propose,39
NA,"to refer to this matter at any length now,",39
NA,as it is one with which I intend to deal,39
NA,fully when the tariff schedule is being,39
NA,"debated, I must state my belief that this",39
NA,tendency.to purchase motor vehicles from,39
NA,"other than our best customers, should not",39
NA,be allowed to pass without comment,39
NA,when we are discussing the volume of our,39
NA,purchases from abroad. We must be pre-,39
NA,pared to purchase from countries which,39
NA,are good customers ancl should not expend,39
NA,our purchasing power in buying from a,39
NA,country which practically refuses to buy,39
NA,from us in return.,39
NA,"Several speakers, including the Prime",39
NA,"Minister, in making reference to the",39
NA,finances of this country and to the over-,39
NA,"seas trade balance, have commented upon",39
NA,the great assistance which has been ren-,39
NA,dered this country in the last few years,39
NA,by the increased wool prices. This coun-,39
NA,"try, I think, should pause to consider how",39
NA,much its prosperity and finances are,39
NA,"based upon our great basic industry,",39
NA,"namely, the wool-growing industry. We",39
NA,talk with a certain amount of pride about,39
NA,having been able to set up in this country,39
NA,a standard of living which compares more,39
NA,than favorably with that of any other,39
NA,"country, and various political parties are",39
NA,apt to throw out their chests and try to,39
NA,show that this for the most part is duo,39
NA,to the wonderful political activities of,39
NA,"their particular parties, but the real",39
NA,son for it is the outstanding wool-growing,39
NA,industry. With the possible exception of,39
NA,"South Africa with its gold-mining, no",39
NA,other country has its finances so closely,39
NA,bound to a particular industry as Aus-,39
NA,tralia's prosperity is bound to the wool-,39
NA,growing industry. As it is an industry,39
NA,which has never come cap in hand to the,39
NA,"Government asking for assistance, it is",39
NA,of all industries that which has received,39
NA,"not only no assistance, but also the",39
NA,least consideration from the governments,39
NA,"of Australia, Federal and State. Ho",39
NA,"opportunity should be missed, therefore,",39
NA,to remind politicians of how utterly our,39
NA,financial structure is based on this unique,39
NA,industry of ours. I t has been claimed,39
NA,that the rise of wool prices has been for-,39
NA,tuitous and that not in any way are,39
NA,thanks due for this to governmental,39
NA,action. The latter part of this claim the,39
NA,"Government, I think, is prepared to",39
NA,admit; but I should like to point out that,39
NA,the rise has not been merely fortuitous.,39
NA,I t has been due to the very sound policy,39
NA,which has been adopted by the industry,39
NA,itself. When it was bearing a burden,39
NA,"of savage taxation and costs, the wool",39
NA,industry was offered and accepted prices,39
NA,which at times did not amount to much,39
NA,more than half the cost of production.,39
NA,"Nevertheless, the graziers did not go",39
NA,"about snivelling and asking for assistance,",39
NA,"or pleading for artificial fixation of prices,",39
NA,but by meeting the market kept the fac-,39
NA,"tories of the world in production, with",39
NA,the result that to-day the statistical posi-,39
NA,tion of wool is sounder than that of any,39
NA,other commodity in the world.,39
NA,One other point to which I wish to,39
NA,refer is the Prime Minister's justifiable,39
NA,reference to the improvement which has,39
NA,"taken place in finances, in business, and",39
NA,in employment during the tenure of,39
NA,office of the Lyons Government. The,39
NA,Prime Minister would have failed i n his,39
NA,duty i f he had not pointed this out. I,39
NA,"consider, however, that undue com-",39
NA,placency about what has been accom-,39
NA,plished already is dangerous. Rather,39
NA,should we search out the reasons why,39
NA,Australia has made this improvement.,39
NA,One reason has so often been stated that,39
NA,the party opposite may be justified in,39
NA,accusing us of employing a hackneyed,39
NA,"phrase. Nevertheless, we are right in",39
NA,"reaclaiming that the reason is "" restoration",39
NA,"of confidence "". I do not wish to expand",39
NA,"on that, although I do realize the",39
NA,great effect on restoring confidence that,39
NA,the following out of a sound economic,39
NA,policy has had: but I venture to suggest,39
NA,that the very definite affirmative action,39
NA,"of this Government which, above all else,",39
NA,not only restored confidence but also,39
NA,"stimulated employment and business, was",39
NA,its courageous action in making large,39
NA,remissions of taxation to industry directly,39
NA,it saw the financial position taking a turn,39
NA,for tlie better. No other action on the,40
NA,part of this Government has played so,40
NA,important a part in bringing about this,40
NA,improvement. I t was not so much the,40
NA,"amount of relief given to industry, as",40
NA,the psychological effect produced on,40
NA,industry by showing the people that at,40
NA,last they had a government in power that,40
NA,realized the value of reducing taxation,40
NA,"to a minimum. And in saying this, I",40
NA,am not jibing particularly at its prede-,40
NA,"cessor, the Scullin Government; I am",40
NA,referring to all preceding governments.,40
NA,"At any rate, this was the first administra-",40
NA,tion to realize the psychological as well,40
NA,the material effect of reducing taxation.,40
NA,"I fear, however, that i t is now in danger",40
NA,of folding its hands i n complacency and,40
NA,forgetting what still remains to be done.,40
NA,On that first occasion when steps,40
NA,"were taken towards reducing taxation,",40
NA,the Government had to be very brave.,40
NA,But I consider that its financial position,40
NA,has now improved to such an extent that,40
NA,it might well give a very much greater,40
NA,measure of financial relief to the tax-,40
NA,payers.,40
NA,I conclude by saying that the Govern-,40
NA,ment can be entirely exonerated from,40
NA,the two specific charges contained in the,40
NA,censure motion. But it would be most,40
NA,unwise and equally dangerous for the,40
NA,people of Australia should Ministers,40
NA,"fold their hands in complacency,",40
NA,"and say "" Wc have produced this;",40
NA,we can now sit down and watch,40
NA,the ball rolling faster and faster,40
NA,"towards prosperity "". The ball will only",40
NA,roll towards prosperity i f the Government,40
NA,is prepared to give more of that excellent,40
NA,motive power which was supplied by early,40
NA,actions. I urge the Treasurer to devote,40
NA,at least a small portion of the enormous,40
NA,amount of time that he devotes to his,40
NA,"duties, to a close examination of tbe",40
NA,manner in which the load of taxation can,40
NA,be eased from the shoulders of the tax-,40
NA,"payers, because the psychological effect",40
NA,that would follow such a step would re-act,40
NA,to the benefit of the whole country and,40
NA,"create more employment, greater business",40
NA,"activity, and general prosperity.",40
NA,Mi\ LAZZARINI (Werriwa) [6.5] -,40
NA,The honorable gentleman who has just,40
NA,resumed his seat ( Mr Fairbairn) and,40
NA,other honorable members opposite appear,40
NA,to think that when they have declared,40
NA,with an air of detached superiority that,40
NA,the members of the Labour party stand,40
NA,for the national control of finance they,40
NA,have said something very damning and,40
NA,sufficiently condemnatory in itself. We do,40
NA,"take that stand, because we believe that",40
NA,the monetary policy of this country exer-,40
NA,cises an influence possibly greater than,40
NA,that exercised by any other factor upon,40
NA,"the rural, pastoral, industrial and general",40
NA,economic life of Australia. I t is absurd,40
NA,to argue that something that is detached,40
NA,"from the governing body of the nation,",40
NA,"the national parliament, something that",40
NA,as is not required to render an account to,40
NA,"any body except itself, should have the",40
NA,power to engraft a monetary policy upon,40
NA,Australia. I can imagine the howls of,40
NA,the honorable member for Swan ( Mr.,40
NA,"Gregory), the honorable member for For-",40
NA,NA,40
NA,suggested that tlie fiscal policy of this,40
NA,country should be propounded by the,40
NA,"Chamber of Manufactures, because",40
NA,the members of that body have,40
NA,the greatest knowledge and the widest,40
NA,experience of manufacturing opera-,40
NA,tions. I question whether any fiscal,40
NA,"policy, however extreme i t might be in",40
NA,"either direction, could exert upon the",40
NA,general economic structure of our country,40
NA,as great an influence as that exerted by,40
NA,the monetary policy. So i t is quite logi-,40
NA,"cal and reasonable, and in view of the",40
NA,"economic chaos of the world to-day, quite",40
NA,necessary for the monetary policy to be,40
NA,decided by a body such as the national,40
NA,"parliament, which has to stand up to the",40
NA,"daily criticism of the press, and from",40
NA,time to time must give an account of its,40
NA,stewardship to its masters. The press is,40
NA,able to inform the public of what is,40
NA,"happening, and what the effect is likely",40
NA,to be. Everything is done in the light,40
NA,"of day by responsible persons, instead of",40
NA,behind closed doors in a board room of,40
NA,"the Commonwealth Bank, perhaps in col-",40
NA,laboration and association with the very,40
NA,people who make the major portion of,40
NA,their profits from the effects of whatever,40
NA,policy is adopted.,40
NA,The confusion of thought associated,40
NA,with the position is illustrated very,40
NA,clearly in some of the remarks of the hon-,40
NA,orable member for Flinders. That honor-,40
NA,able gentleman stated that the Common-,40
NA,wealth Bank doubtless would use this,40
NA,"£1,000,000 worth of treasury-bills to",41
NA,obtain cash which otherwise would bp,41
NA,placed at fixed deposit. The impression,41
NA,which that would seem to convey is that,41
NA,tbe bank does not use the funds that are,41
NA,placed at fixed deposit with it. I point,41
NA,out that the bank would have the,41
NA,"£1,000,000 in either case, aud would use",41
NA,it for the accommodation of its customers.,41
NA,"As a matter of fact, the funds placed",41
NA,at fixed deposit are of more effective use,41
NA,to the bank than the money it will receive,41
NA,from the sale of treasury-bills.,41
NA,"I am not perturbed, nor is any",41
NA,"other honorable member on this side,",41
NA,at the charge of the honorable,41
NA,member that we stand for the national,41
NA,control and organization of the mone-,41
NA,tary system of this country. We have,41
NA,definitely proclaimed our adherence to,41
NA,that policy throughout Australia. I,41
NA,assure the honorable gentleman tbat when,41
NA,the electors in the not far distant future,41
NA,endorse it by returning this party to,41
NA,"power, he will have no cause to complain",41
NA,when we give effect to it. I f it were not,41
NA,"for the power of the press and wireless,",41
NA,as well as that wielded by the party onpo,41
NA,site with the funds contributed princi-,41
NA,"pally by financial institutions, the people",41
NA,wonld not have been side-tracked into,41
NA,"political dead-ends, but would have",41
NA,accepted it long ago. The honorable,41
NA,gentleman referred to orthodox finance.,41
NA,Our policy is orthodox; i t has been,41
NA,enunciated by the greatest thinkers of the,41
NA,world. I f the people were afforded,41
NA,"reasonable means to analyse it, and were",41
NA,not led astray by malignant -misrepre-,41
NA,"sentation, they would always follow it.",41
NA,"As the debate proceeds, it appears to",41
NA,me that the House is losing sight of the,41
NA,"terms of the motion, and that the vote",41
NA,may be given on other than the real issue,41
NA,raised by the Leader of the Opposition,41
NA,( Mr Curtin). Many honorable members,41
NA,have demanded to know what will be,41
NA,done. We say what we would do. The,41
NA,Government is charged with a definite,41
NA,"offence on two counts, and that charge",41
NA,alone constitutes the subject-matter of,41
NA,this debate. No attempt has been made,41
NA,to answer it. The gravamen of it is that,41
NA,responsible government has been hancW,41
NA,over to a body which is not responsible,41
NA,to the people. The major feature of the,41
NA,charge is that the Commonwealth Go-,41
NA,vernment has allowed the Commonwealth,41
NA,Kl,41
NA,Bank Board exclusively to direct monetary,41
NA,"policy in this country, and that that",41
NA,vitally affects the economic position of,41
NA,all industry and of our people generally.,41
NA,A further feature of i t is the refusal to,41
NA,adopt proper measures to prevent the,41
NA,development overseas of an unfavorable,41
NA,"trade balance, which will possibly cause",41
NA,a deadlock similar to that which occurred,41
NA,some years ago. Those members of the,41
NA,Government who have so far spoken have,41
NA,refused to face these direct accusations.,41
NA,The Commonwealth Bank either does or,41
NA,does not control monetary policy. I f it,41
NA,"does, and as a result the economic life",41
NA,"of our people is affected, the board is dis-",41
NA,charging what should be the function of,41
NA,"this Parliament. Consequently, when the",41
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Lyons) admits' that,41
NA,"the board has the sole right to do this,",41
NA,he admits the soundness of the charge of,41
NA,the Leader of the Opposition. An,41
NA,analysis of the speeches of the Trea-,41
NA,surer ( Mr Casey) and the Prime Minis-,41
NA,ter will convince honorable mem-,41
NA,bers that there is no greater example,41
NA,anywbfere of loose and muddled thinking,41
NA,"in regard to economic problems, particu-",41
NA,larly the problem of finance. The Trea-,41
NA,surer informed honorable -members that,41
NA,no one had any knowledge of the pro-,41
NA,bable economic and financial effect of the,41
NA,action of the Commonwealth Bank.,41
NA,Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m.,41
Mr LAZZARINI ,Th e relations,41
NA,between the Government and the Com-,41
NA,monwealth Bank approach the ludicrous,41
NA,when we have both the Prime Minister,41
NA,and the Treasurer telling the House that,41
NA,the Commonwealth Bank has sole respon-,41
NA,"sibility for monetary policy, and then",41
NA,the Treasurer telling us that this institu-,41
NA,tion is launching out on some experiment,41
NA,of tbe effect of which upon the economic,41
NA,life of the nation nobody has the slightest,41
NA,idea. One of the charges levelled against,41
NA,the members of my party was that we,41
NA,were the only people who attempted ex-,41
NA,"periments bordering upon the dangerous,",41
NA,"and that, such experiments followed",41
NA,well defined and established lines of,41
NA,policy. Yet while the institution,41
NA,responsible for a change of tbe economic,41
NA,and monetary policy of Australia,41
NA,launches out in what he terms an experi-,41
NA,"ment, the consequences of which he can-",41
NA,"not predict, the Treasurer is content to",41
NA,twiddle his thumbs and take no notice.,42
NA,We are told that this kind of thing gives,42
NA,abounding confidence to the people of,42
NA,Australia in the institutions for which the,42
NA,Government is responsible. We have,42
NA,"heard tho words ""confidence""",42
NA,""" restoration"" repeated ad nauseum in",42
NA,this debate as they have been for many,42
NA,years. It seems to me that the confidence,42
NA,of which the Treasurer speaks is more the,42
NA,"confidence that the ""mug"" has in his",42
NA,ability to defeat the wiles of the thimble-,42
NA,aud-pea man and the exponents of the,42
NA,"three-card trick, the confidence of the",42
NA,"punter that he can beat the bookmaker,",42
NA,"the confidence of the burglar that, he can",42
NA,evade capture by the police. Certainly,42
NA,the private banks appear to be confident,42
NA,that they can go on meddling with the,42
NA,economic life of the country for their own,42
NA,"benefit, and can always depend upon com-",42
NA,plaisant governments and Ministers,42
NA,to put over the hocus-pocus in,42
NA,"this Parliament, and to create a",42
NA,psychology that will prevent the people,42
NA,from realizing what jobbery is going,42
NA,"on. Hearing the Treasurer ""speak",42
NA,of this restoration of confidence and of,42
NA,"all the money available, one would think",42
NA,that when a Labour government comes,42
NA,into power the people lose confidence in,42
NA,"the banking institutions, draw their",42
NA,money out and bury it; later with a,42
NA,change of government confidence is re-,42
NA,"stored, money is put back into the banks,",42
NA,and increased accommodation is available,42
NA,to industry and governments. According,42
NA,to the Prime Minister a restoration of,42
NA,confidence took place immediately after,42
NA,he ceased to be Treasurer of a Labour,42
NA,government and became the Prime Min-,42
NA,ister of the United Australia party Go-,42
NA,vernment. For the policy in respect of,42
NA,which he criticized the Scullin Govern-,42
NA,ment yesterday he was as much respon-,42
NA,sible as anybody. As a matter of fact,42
NA,when the present Prime Minister occupied,42
NA,"the portfolios, first of Postmaster-General",42
NA,"and later of Treasurer, in the Scullin",42
NA,"Government, he was one of the prime",42
NA,movers to bring about a policy of defla-,42
NA,tion and to prevent cheap interest rates;,42
NA,he was spurring the party on to give,42
NA,effect to that policy. He left the Labour,42
NA,party and became Prime Minister of a,42
NA,government of a different political com-,42
NA,plexion. He knows and we know that,42
NA,Mr Lazsarini.,42
NA,in what he said yesterday he was speak-,42
NA,ing with his tongue in his cheek.,42
NA,The fact is that there has been,42
NA,no alteration in the actual volume of,42
NA,money in this country for a decade or,42
NA,"and more. I take 1922 as a neutral year, a",42
NA,year far removed from the circumstances,42
NA,"with which this censure motion deals, a",42
NA,year when there was no thought of those,42
NA,things which have happened since.,42
NA,The Commonwealth Year-Book shows,42
NA,that since 1922 there has been no,42
NA,appreciable alteration in the actual,42
NA,volume of money in this country.,42
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,Wha t does the,42
NA,honorable member call money ?,42
Mr LAZZARINI ,Th e same as,42
NA,economists call money-th e currency of,42
NA,"the country, and the control of it",42
NA,rests wholly with the Government. The,42
NA,drift in Australia's economic life com-,42
NA,menced with the visit to Australia in,42
NA,"1927 of Sir Ernest Harvey, a director of",42
NA,"the Bank of England, who was followed",42
NA,"four years later by the "" Big Pour "" led",42
NA,"by Sir Arthur Duckham, who in turn",42
NA,"were followed by Sir Otto Niemeyer, who",42
NA,completed Australia's economic destruc-,42
NA,tion. The year 1922 was well in advance,42
NA,"of those happenings, and in that year the",42
NA,actual volume of money in Australia was,42
NA,"£58,000,000; in 1930, practically the",42
NA,middle of the Scullin Government's,42
NA,"regime, it was £53,000,000; whilst at the",42
NA,"end of 1935, the actual volume of money",42
NA,"in Australia was £55,000,000. The",42
NA,Commonwealth Statistician informs us,42
NA,"that at all times, practically half of the",42
NA,total money in circulation is in the hands,42
NA,of the people; it is the till money of the,42
NA,nation and is constantly moving from one,42
NA,"holder to another. We find, therefore,",42
NA,"that, in 1922, £29,000,000 was in the",42
NA,hands of the banks for the creation of the,42
NA,"superstructure of credit; in 1930, when",42
NA,"the Scullin Government was in power, the",42
NA,"amount was £26,500,000, and to-day it is",42
NA,"£27,500,000. The variation disclosed",42
NA,by those figures is insignificant in com-,42
NA,parison with the great volume of credit,42
NA,created by cheque pounds and bank,42
NA,advances. Any other purchasing power,42
NA,in Australia is bank-created credit or,42
NA,money. Democracy took from despotic,42
NA,kings control of tbe issue of credit and,42
NA,"vested it in constitutional government, but",42
NA,instead of the government retaining that,42
NA,"control, the banks have been allowed to",43
NA,usurp i t and with the exception of the,43
NA,"£27,500,000 held by the banks i n deposit,",43
NA,"the whole of the £500,000,000 upon which",43
NA,the banks charge interest is a fictitious,43
NA,credit which the banks have created with -,43
NA,out any legal authority. When the,43
NA,Treasurer and the Prime Minister speak,43
NA,of the shortage of money during the,43
NA,"Scullin Government's regime, or of con-",43
NA,"traction or deflation, they prove the truth",43
NA,of what the members of this party have,43
NA,"said consistently, and insist upon to-day,",43
NA,"namely, that when Labour is i n power",43
NA,"the banking institutions used"" all the",43
NA,powers tbey usurped f r o m Parliament i n,43
NA,order to hamper and discredit the Govern-,43
NA,ment. When their friends are back on,43
NA,the treasury bench their policy changes.,43
NA,Our charges are proved by the statements,43
NA,of honorable members opposite. For,43
NA,"instance, the honorable member f o r",43
NA,Barker ( Mr Archie Cameron) made a,43
NA,speech which might well have been pre-,43
NA,"pared by Mr Davidson, general manager",43
NA,of the Bank of New South Wales; yet,43
NA,he belongs to a party that is supposed to,43
NA,represent a section of the community,43
NA,which has been financially and economi-,43
NA,cally crucified by the banks.,43
NA,wheat-growers ancl other farmers of Aus-,43
NA,tralia have a debt structure of f r o m,43
NA,"£300,000,000 to £400,000,000.",43
NA,institutions which in the past created the,43
NA,land boom and then caused the boom to,43
NA,"burst, took f r o m the producers two-thirds",43
NA,of the richest lands of Australia; and,43
NA,later created another little boom i n order,43
NA,that they could sell out at a high profit.,43
NA,Everything we have contended has been,43
NA,proved out of the mouths of Government,43
NA,members and responsible Ministers. They,43
NA,"speak, apparently with satisfaction, of the",43
NA,economic distress that overtook this,43
NA,"country in 1930, and when they claim that",43
NA,the returning prosperity now being experi-,43
NA,enced is due to cheaper money being,43
NA,"available to the people, they accuse the",43
NA,banks. A l l statistics prove that the,43
NA,banker is the nigger i n the wood-pile.,43
NA,Wc are prepared to allow our case to rest,43
NA,on the utterances of Ministers and their,43
NA,supporters. The Prime Minister has,43
NA,said that the restoration of confidence has,43
NA,caused a great demand f o r bank credit;,43
NA,the truth is that there would never have,43
NA,been this great demand i f the bankers had,43
NA,not first restricted that credit. I f we,43
NA,"consider the events of 1927-2S, we",43
NA,find tbat the banking policy of the associ-,43
NA,ated banks of this country was one of,43
NA,deliberate restriction of industry-,43
NA,primary and secondary. When industry,43
NA,still wanted to expand as i t had been,43
NA,"expanding up to 1929, the banks refused",43
NA,to provide money for that purpose; on,43
NA,the contrary they commenced at that time,43
NA,to curtail credit. I shall give the House,43
NA,one concrete example of this. A manu-,43
NA,facturer of cotton goods i n a substantial,43
NA,"way had, like many other big industrial",43
NA,"concerns, large accommodation f r o m the",43
NA,bank i n order to carry on. This,43
NA,gentleman informed me that he required,43
NA,"further accommodation to buy 1,000",43
NA,bales of Queensland cotton to carry on his,43
NA,industry. From the time he had first,43
NA,"obtained accommodation f r o m the bank,",43
NA,"the assets of his company had doubled,",43
NA,"and, as I have said, he wanted additional",43
NA,accommodation f o r the purchase of,43
NA,cotton. The bank not only refused to,43
NA,make further accommodation avail-,43
NA,"able to him, but also required hi m to",43
NA,"reduce his then overdraft by £150,000,",43
NA,One thousand bales of Australian cotton,43
NA,"had to be put on board a ship, sent to",43
NA,"The Liverpool and brought back to Australia,",43
NA,in order to enable this company to obtain,43
NA,finance with which to carry on its opera-,43
NA,These tions. Whilst the banks at that time,43
NA,were out to curtail industrial develop-,43
NA,"ment i n Australia, they were allowing",43
NA,credit to be made available to an,43
NA,abnormal extent for the erection of large,43
NA,flats and palatial picture theatres i n the,43
NA,capital cities.,43
Mr MCCALL ,America n capital.,43
Mr LAZZARINI , N o ; these ventures,43
NA,were financed by the banks. A l l that,43
NA,credit was made available at a time when,43
NA,the development of primary and second-,43
NA,ary industries was being retarded. The,43
NA,Commonwealth Bank Board was a party,43
NA,to that policy.,43
NA,Some honorable members opposite,43
NA,seem to think that the charge against the,43
NA,Labour party that i t is opposed to the,43
NA,"board is unanswerable, but the m a j o r i ty",43
NA,of the members of my party believe in,43
NA,"the Commonwealth Bank, and consider",43
NA,that i t should carry out the functions for,43
NA,which i t was founded. As soon as my,43
NA,party gets an opportunity to do so. i t,43
NA,will take action to enable tbe bank to,44
NA,direct tbe monetary policy of Australia,44
NA,in tbe interests of the people generally.,44
NA,"My objection is to the financial views,",44
NA,"and to the personal and social interests,",44
NA,of the gentlemen whom the present,44
NA,Government appoints to tbe board f r o m,44
NA,time to time. I am opposed to the board's,44
NA,policy in nearly all its aspects. The,44
NA,present Government has hamstrung the,44
NA,Commonwealth Bank by preventing i t,44
NA,from competing with the private banks.,44
NA,I t has become merely a bulwark on which,44
NA,"the associated banks lean, and from",44
NA,which they obtain accommodation which,44
NA,"no other citizen, irrespective of the",44
NA,"amount of his assets, is permitted to",44
NA,enjoy. There is close association between,44
NA,the members of the board and the private,44
NA,banks. Their interests are so interwoven,44
NA,that the Commonwealth Bank and the,44
NA,private banks form a common associa-,44
NA,"tion. I have heard i t called "" The",44
NA,"Thieves' Kitchen "". The Commonwealth",44
NA,Bank Board has taken a certain action,44
NA,"with regard to treasury-bills, and, pos-",44
NA,"sibly using that, as an excuse, the leading",44
NA,institution among the associated trading,44
NA,banks immediatelv raised its rate of,44
NA,interest. This was done either m,44
NA,defiance of the Commonwealth Bank and,44
NA,the Government or in collaboration with,44
NA,the bank board. The action of the,44
NA,board in the near future w i l l prove,44
NA,whether there has been a .deliberate,44
NA,"attempt to create deflation, or whether",44
NA,the associated banks are acting indepen-,44
NA,dently of the Commonwealth Bank.,44
Mr MCCALL ,Th e private bank to,44
NA,which the honorable member has referred,44
NA,is not one of the associated banks.,44
Mr LAZZARINI , T h a t statement,44
NA,pure eyewash. I am wondering whether,44
NA,tbe Commonwealth Bank Board is not,44
NA,even now considering the increase of its,44
NA,"interest, rate to that fixed by the Bank of",44
NA,"New South ""Wales. I think, and I am",44
NA,"almost convinced, that within a few days",44
NA,the Commonwealth Bank also will raise,44
NA,its rate. I f i t resists this attempt to,44
NA,secure an all-round increase of the,44
NA,"interest rate, the Government, to show",44
NA,"that it is sincere, should introduce legis-",44
NA,lation to enable the bank to go out after,44
NA,business i n competition with the private,44
NA,institutions. The press has been con-,44
NA,demning the Commonwealth,44
NA,throughout the piece. I saw i n the last,44
NA,issue of the Sunday Sun and Guardian a,44
NA,cartoon on the subject of the bank's pro-,44
NA,posed offer of treasury-bills to the,44
NA,"public. That journal, of course, is a",44
NA,"bankers' newspaper, for i t is controlled",44
NA,and owned by a bank. I f the people,44
NA,generally were aware of that fact they,44
NA,would hesitate to accept all its statements,44
NA,on financial matters. I n the cartoon,44
NA,prosperity was depicted as a motor car,44
NA,proceeding along the road to national,44
NA,recovery. The Commonwealth Bank was,44
NA,shown as a traffic policeman holding up,44
NA,"his hand'to stop the car, and a less promi-",44
NA,"nent uniformed official, representing the",44
NA,"private trading banks, remarked "" O.K.,",44
NA,"Chief "". I f the interest rate can be raised",44
NA,"all round, and i f , by insidious press",44
NA,"propaganda, the public can be led to",44
NA,believe tbat the Commonwealth Bank,44
NA,"is solely responsible fo r the increase, the",44
NA,newspapers will have achieved the result,44
NA,they desire.,44
NA,The Prime Minister ( Mr Lyons),44
NA,"spoke of cheap money that, had been made",44
NA,available because of action taken by the,44
NA,present Government. When be was a,44
NA,member of another party and a Minister,44
NA,"as well, he was a most ardent supporter",44
NA,of the resistance of the associated banks,44
NA,to the lowering of the interest rate. As,44
NA,"a matter of fact, i f the truth were known,",44
NA,his support of the associated banks was,44
NA,the real and a sufficient reason why he,44
NA,left the Labour party and joined the,44
NA,United Australia party.,44

Mr HUGHES ,North Sydney-Minis -,44

NA,"- I cannot, hope to follow the honorable",44
NA,member f o r Werriwa ( Mr Lazzarini),44
NA,and those adventurous colleagues of his,44
NA,who have plunged into the dark,44
NA,"thickets of finance and banking, as viewed",44
NA,"from, certain angles, and f r o m which they",44
NA,have not been able to extricate themselves,44
NA,i n tbe time permitted in this debate. I,44
NA,"have some doubt, indeed, whether I shall",44
NA,be able to cover that legitimate field into,44
NA,which the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr .,44
NA,Curtin) led us i n his admirable opening,44
NA,"speech. Narrowed down, this motion",44
NA,charges the Government with f a i l i n g to,44
NA,"Bank check unnecessary imports, leaving the",44
NA,Commonwealth Bank Board to do,45
NA,what the Government itself ought,45
NA,"to have done, and then disclaiming",45
NA,responsibility f o r what the bank has,45
NA,"done, which, i t is asserted, must pre-",45
NA,"judice employment, trade and commerce,",45
NA,and the condition of the people generally.,45
NA,"Now, what has the bank done? I speak",45
NA,not at all of these extravaganzas to which,45
NA,"we have listened for the last hour or two,",45
NA,but to the sober indictment which fell,45
NA,from the lips of the Leader of the Opposi-,45
NA,tion. I t proposes to offer to the public,45
NA,"£1,000,000 worth of treasury-bills ! Tha:",45
NA,is the beginning and end of the,45
NA,charge which the honorable gentleman,45
NA,himself levelled against the board.,45
NA,Government is also chided for its negli-,45
NA,gence in not applying a remedy to con-,45
NA,"ditions that must, so the honorable",45
NA,"gentleman tells us, lead to disas-",45
NA,trous results. Let us take the case against,45
NA,"the bank first. The bank has, as I have",45
NA,"said, decided to issue treasury-bills to the",45
NA,"amount of £1,000,000. That, i n itself, is",45
NA,"nothing to excite even comment, let alone",45
NA,"criticism, and I agree with my colleague",45
NA,the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) when he said,45
NA,that had the private banks not chosen to,45
NA,regard this action of the Commonwealth,45
NA,Bank as a happy chance to j u s t i f y the,45
NA,"increase of the rate of interest, we should",45
NA,have heard nothing about it. I t is not,45
NA,suggested that the action of the bank is,45
NA,novel. I t is true that hitherto i t has not,45
NA,"made treasury-bills available to the public,",45
NA,but I have yet to learn that the,45
NA,innovation is deserving of censure.,45
NA,As honorable members know very well,45
NA,these are old bills. They represent a,45
NA,small fraction of the bills held by the,45
NA,Commonwealth Bank and the trading,45
NA,banks. They have been offered to the,45
NA,public at the same rate of interest as has,45
NA,"obtained for fifteen months and, i n my",45
NA,"opinion, that, in itself, is not. justification",45
NA,for the action of the private banks in,45
NA,raisina: the rate of interest. I t is not,45
NA,suggested that the Commonwealth Bank,45
NA,"itself has followed that example, and",45
NA,certainly it does not warrant the,45
NA,statement made by the honorable mem-,45
NA,"ber, and repeated by his colleagues, that",45
NA,"this antion was taken as part, of a.",45
NA,deliberate plan to retard recovery in this,45
NA,country. The honorable member for,45
NA,"""West Sydney ( Mr Beasley) levelled that",45
NA,charge in unmeasured terms. He alleged,45
NA,that the Commonwealth Bank had acted,45
NA,in collusion with the trading banks to,45
NA,retard the remarkable recovery f r o m,45
NA,the depression that the country has made,45
NA,as a result of the policy of the Govern-,45
NA,ment. What evidence is there to support,45
NA,a charge so monstrous and so odious?,45
NA,Although he did not accuse all Minis-,45
NA,"ters, the honorable member did not hesi-",45
NA,tate to charge the Government with,45
NA,having not only known beforehand what,45
NA,"action the bank proposed to take, but also",45
NA,with having instigated the bank to do,45
NA,"what i t desired, but had not the courage",45
NA,to do itself. I ask the House to,45
NA,The contrast what the Leader of the Opposi-,45
NA,tion ( Mr Curtin) said i n regard to the,45
NA,relations between the bank and tbe,45
NA,"Government, with the statements of the",45
NA,honorable member for West Sydney,45
NA,and several of his colleagues. The,45
NA,gravamen of the charge made by,45
NA,the Leader of the Opposition was that,45
NA,the Government failed to assert,45
NA,"itself and insist that, as finance is vital",45
NA,"to the well-being of the country, i t should",45
NA,"have control of financial policy, i n order",45
NA,to ensure the well-being of the com-,45
NA,munity. He and some of his colleagues,45
NA,said that the Commonwealth Bank is,45
NA,actually independent of the Common-,45
NA,"wealth Government, and that the bank,",45
NA,"in effect, is the overlord of the Govern-",45
NA,ment-thi s despite the fact that yester-,45
NA,day when the Prime Minister ( Mr .,45
NA,Lyons) was setting out i n measured,45
NA,terms the many and great services that,45
NA,the bank had rendered since the appoint-,45
NA,"ment of the board, the honorable member",45
NA,for Melbourne Ports ( Mr Holloway),45
NA,interjected that the bank was a mere,45
NA,bookkeeper for the Government. Pre-,45
NA,cisely what the honorable member meant,45
NA,I do not know; at any rate a book-,45
NA,keeper occupies a subordinate position;,45
NA,"he is the servant of another. Thus, on",45
NA,the one hand we have the statement that,45
NA,the Bank Board is an independent,45
NA,"agency, that it, controls finances-the l i f e",45
NA,of the community-an d that the -Govern-,45
NA,ment is as nothing. And on the other,45
NA,hand we are told that the Commonwealth,45
NA,"Government, being craven-spirited and",45
NA,hesitating to do that which i t believes,45
NA,"ought to be done, has used the Common-",45
NA,wealth Bank Board as a tool to carry,45
NA,out its nefarious purposes. These two,46
NA,statements are entirely inconsistent. I,46
NA,am not suggesting for one moment that,46
NA,the Leader of the Opposition was guilty,46
NA,"of that inconsistency, but the Govern-",46
NA,ment has to deal with these charges as,46
NA,they are made. I protest most emphati-,46
NA,cally against the charge made by the,46
NA,honorable member for West Sydney that,46
NA,the Government is a party to a base con-,46
NA,spiracy to destroy Australian industries,46
NA,"and to sacrifice them on the "" altar of",46
NA,"Ottawa "".",46
NA,"OPPOSITION MEMBERS -Hear , hear I",46
Mr HUGHES ,Eve n the ranks of,46
NA,Tuscany can scarce forbear to cheer,46
NA,my presentation of the honorable,46
NA,member's contention. No one in this,46
NA,House has stood more zealously or more,46
NA,consistently for Australian industries,46
NA,"than I have, and I would rather go",46
NA,out of this Government and even out of,46
NA,"this Parliament, than be aparty to any-",46
NA,thing which would injure Australian,46
NA,industries.,46
NA,The Leader of the Opposition stated,46
NA,that tbe Government has failed in its duty,46
NA,by not checking imports. By that he,46
NA,means there has been such an excess of,46
NA,imports over exports as to imperil the,46
NA,stability of this country and to threaten,46
NA,us with a repetition of the conditions,46
NA,which brought about the depression. He,46
NA,has failed utterly to show that any need,46
NA,exists for action in this respect. The,46
NA,Prime Minister answered that charge i n,46
NA,terms that have not been challenged. The,46
NA,right honorable member has shown that,46
NA,up to the first week in March there was,46
NA,a balance of exports over imports to the,46
NA,"value of £17,700,000 as against an excess",46
NA,"of £16,100,000 for the whole of the year",46
NA,1934-35. I f this be a fact-an d no one,46
NA,has challenged the Prime Minister's state-,46
NA,ment-wher e is the need for the action,46
NA,vocated by the Leader of the Opposition ?,46
NA,Why should we disturb a settled condition,46
NA,of things under which we continue to,46
NA,emerge from depression into prosperity?,46
NA,Tbe honorable gentleman suggested three,46
NA,alternative methods by which we could,46
NA,"have avoided that action which, he alleges,",46
NA,has been taken by the bank to correct an,46
NA,unfavorable economic position. I f the,46
NA,honorable gentleman himself did not do,46
NA,"so, certainly some of his colleagues",46
NA,claimed that the action of the Common-,46
NA,wealth Bank was taken for the deliberate,46
NA,purpose of checking imports through an,46
NA,increase of the interest rate. No evidence,46
NA,whatever has been advanced in support of,46
NA,that assertion. During this debate efforts,46
NA,have been made to belittle the Common-,46
NA,"wealth Bank Board, and certain honor-",46
NA,able members have taken refuge in the,46
NA,flimsy shelter of a declaration to the effect,46
NA,that they are decrying not the Common-,46
NA,"wealth Bank, but merely the board. We",46
NA,have been asked to believe that there was,46
NA,a golden age in which the Commonwealth,46
NA,Bank standing for lofty ideals did,46
NA,yeoman and wonderful service for the,46
NA,"country, and this, so it is said, the bank",46
NA,was able to do because i t was then con-,46
NA,trolled by tbe Government. There is not,46
NA,one word of truth in that statement; the,46
NA,Commonwealth Bank was never under,46
NA,"political control. Naturally, some honor-",46
NA,able members who have come into public,46
NA,life recently are compelled to swallow as,46
NA,gospel the loose and utterly inaccurate,46
NA,statements made by their older colleagues.,46
NA,Let me here administer a wholesome cor-,46
NA,rective; I shall not claim that it will be,46
NA,an emetic. I n the paean of praise which,46
NA,he showered upon the Commonwealth,46
NA,Bank as he conceived it to exist in its,46
NA,"golden age, the honorable member for Mel-",46
NA,"bourne Ports ( Mr Holloway), endeav-",46
NA,oured to lead us to believe that there was,46
NA,something about the control exercised by,46
NA,the Bank Board that differed funda-,46
NA,mentally from the control exercised by,46
NA,the first Governor of the bank (- Sir,46
NA,Denison Miller). The honorable mem-,46
NA,"ber, who surprised me with the",46
NA,"fertility of his invention, told an apo-",46
NA,cryphal story of what happened,46
NA,"during the war, when, adjured by",46
NA,me or some equally insignificant,46
NA,"person, all the bankers of Australia",46
NA,ad- trembled before the Government and gave,46
NA,"us £100,000,000 or £200,000,000, or may",46
NA,"be it was £300,000,000, at a rate of inter-",46
NA,est which is too paltry to mention in a,46
NA,"great assembly like this. Unhappily, the",46
NA,honorable member's story is not quite,46
NA,"true. Leaving fiction, let us turn to facts :",46
NA,Let me read an extract from a speech,46
NA,"made by myself on the 22nd of November,",46
NA,"1911, during the second reading debate",46
NA,"on the Commonwealth Bank Bill, and",46
NA,reported in Hansard Vol. LXII . page,46
NA,3044. I need hardly remind honorable,47
NA,members that I was a member of the,47
NA,Ministry that established the Common-,47
NA,wealth Bank. For twelve years from 1911,47
NA,"to 1923, with the exception of ten months,",47
NA,I was a member of that or succeeding,47
NA,"governments, and therefore no one is",47
NA,better qualified than myself to speak con-,47
NA,cerning the operations of the Common-,47
NA,wealth Bank and the relations between the,47
NA,Government and the bank during its,47
NA,early years. The then Opposition had,47
NA,stated that the bill would create a bank,47
NA,that was practically-,47
NA,under the control of the government of the day,47
NA,and the parliament of the hour.,47
NA,I n order to show that the suggestion was,47
NA,"entirely baseless, I said-",47
NA,Tlic scope of the powers of the Governor,47
NA,is precisely limited. He is placed above the,47
NA,power of any party influence . . . put in,47
NA,a position to exercise authority and to make,47
NA,"the best he can of the business, and he will",47
NA,have behind him the credit of the Common-,47
NA,"wealth, of which nothing can rob him . . .",47
NA,The Commonwealth Bank will have behind i t,47
NA,the resources and power of the Commonwealth.,47
NA,I then went on to show that the bank's,47
NA,powers and authority were clearly set,47
NA,"forth in the act, and added tbat i t was-",47
NA,to carry on in a legitimate way tlie business,47
NA,of hanking. Tt was to compete with other,47
NA,"banks, and to do that it must conduct tlie",47
NA,bank in a business-like way.,47
NA,I concluded my speech by saying-,47
NA,This bill placed the bank clearly and unmis-,47
NA,takably out of the control of any political and,47
NA,"extraneous influence, so far as any human",47
NA,institution can be.,47
NA,"Speaking as one who knows, I say defi-",47
NA,nitely that during and after the war years,47
NA,the bank was an entirely free agent. A t,47
NA,no time was i t subjected to control or,47
NA,interference by the Government of,47
NA,the day. And that is,47
NA,the positron of the bank to-day.,47
NA,Because of the sound business principles,47
NA,"upon which i t is based, i t has achieved",47
NA,the magnificent results that now stand to,47
NA,its credit. The honorable member for,47
NA,Melbourne Ports ( Mr Holloway) spoke,47
NA,this afternoon of what the bank had done,47
NA,in tbe way of floating huge loans f or,47
NA,the Commonwealth Government.,47
NA,the bank had been conducted on tbe lines,47
NA,suggested by the honorable member f o r,47
NA,West Sydney ( Mr Beasley) or the honor-,47
NA,able member for Werriwa ( Mr Lazza-,47
NA,r i n i ) i t would never have got out of its,47
NA,swaddling clothes. I t has waxed and,47
NA,grown strong because i t has won tbe con-,47
NA,fidence of the people and has carried on,47
NA,the business of banking in a business-like,47
NA,way. The honorable member f or Mel-,47
NA,bourne Ports argued that the bank should,47
NA,be controlled by the Government or Par-,47
NA,liament. Can any honorable member,47
NA,seriously contend that we are equipped,47
NA,with sufficient knowledge of the intricate,47
NA,business of banking to say how,47
NA,much credit is necessary for the govern-,47
NA,mental and industrial activities of this,47
NA,country? The honorable gentleman,47
NA,waxed enthusiastic i n regard to some,47
NA,system under which the Commonwealth,47
NA,Bank could pump credit into the,47
NA,"economic structure. As to that, all",47
NA,I need say is that to give to Parliament,47
NA,or a government under the party system,47
NA,the power to pump credit into the,47
NA,economic structure would be like entrust-,47
NA,ing men already f a r gone i n drink with,47
NA,the authority to decide how much liquor,47
NA,every man-includin g themselves-ough t,47
NA,to have. Who is going to say when,47
NA,the pumping should cease? No car-,47
NA,toon would excite the risibilities of the,47
NA,multitude more effectively than a picture,47
NA,of the honorable gentleman f o r Melbourne,47
NA,Ports pumping credit into the economic,47
NA,system of the Commonwealth under,47
NA,direction f r o m those who control his,47
NA,party inside and outside this cham-,47
NA,ber. How could the amount of,47
NA,credit to be made available be deter-,47
NA,mined by a majority of members on either,47
NA,side of the House? And how could there,47
NA,be confidence i n any bank so controlled?,47
NA,"Let, me repeat that the activities of the",47
NA,Commonwealth Bank have been con«,47
NA,"ducted on sound business principles, and",47
NA,"precisely because of this fact, i t has won the confi-",47
NA,dence of the people. Now i n the exercise,47
NA,"of its wisdom, and as the result of long",47
NA,"experience, when the board has decided",47
NA,"I o issue £1,000,000 worth of treasury-bills",47
NA,"to the public, i t is covered with abuse.",47
NA,Most odious charges are levelled at the,47
NA,board and the Government whose only,47
NA,"faul t is that, in its relations with the",47
NA,"If bank, i t has followed in the footsteps of",47
NA,earlier governments the great virtues and,47
NA,achievements of. which honorable mem-,47
NA,bers opposite now pretend to laud. There,47
NA,is no evidence whatever to sustain the,48
NA,charge levelled at the Government.,48
NA,The Leader of the Opposition would,48
NA,have the people of this country believe,48
NA,that the action of the bank in issuing,48
NA,treasury-bills has been taken for the,48
NA,express purpose of destroying the Austra-,48
NA,lian industries with consequent increase,48
NA,of unemployment. I t has also been said,48
NA,that the Government had been con-,48
NA,"sulted, that the Government was",48
NA,in collusion with the bank and was,48
NA,using that institution as its tool.,48
NA,To that charge I reply that the,48
NA,record of the Government speaks for,48
NA,itself. The figures relating to increased,48
NA,"employment, especially iu our secondary",48
NA,industries are an effective answer. When,48
NA,this Government came into office 29 per,48
NA,"cent, of our adult rjopulation were",48
NA,unemployed; to-day the figure is down to,48
NA,13.6 per cent. I n every part of this,48
NA,country there is evidence of reviving trade,48
NA,and expanding industries. This is,48
NA,especially true of our secondary indus-,48
NA,"tries, behind which, it is said by some",48
NA,"honorable members opposite, we are now",48
NA,standing with a dagger in order to stab,48
NA,"them in the back! The truth is that, as",48
NA,"a result of this Government's policy,",48
NA,there has been the most surprising revival,48
NA,of industry in the history of the nation.,48
NA,"Our factories now give employment, to",48
NA,"459,000 operatives, and they are rapidly",48
NA,"extending. My colleague, the Minister",48
NA,for Trade and Customs ( Mr White) has,48
NA,"shown that the rising tide of imports,",48
NA,against which the Leader of the Opposi-,48
NA,"tion pointed his oratorical dagger, con-",48
NA,sists mainly of those classes of goods,48
NA,which are essential for the conduct and,48
NA,"expansion of Australian industries, and",48
NA,that other goods which may be in the,48
NA,luxury class are an outward and visible,48
NA,sign of the increased spending power of,48
NA,"the people, due to the policy of this",48
NA,Government. Does the Leader of the,48
NA,Opposition deny that?,48
NA,But I am not one of those who dwell,48
NA,on past achievements. We have gone far,48
NA,along tho road to recovery but we,48
NA,"have yet far to travel, and I for one",48
NA,will never be satisfied while in this,48
NA,"country, there is one man anxious for",48
NA,work but unable to obtain it. That is,48
NA,the goal to which I direct my steps.,48
NA,Mr Hughes.,48
NA,This Government proposes to continue,48
NA,its progressive policy which has brought,48
NA,about the magnificent results that con-,48
NA,"front us on every hand, and if ever it",48
NA,meets a situation such as that visualized,48
NA,"by the Leader of the Opposition, it will",48
NA,deal with it promptly. I do not for a,48
NA,moment contend that an ample supply of,48
NA,credit is not essential to recovery. I have,48
NA,said again and again that we must have,48
NA,an ample supply of credit for necessary,48
NA,public works and the expansion of indus-,48
NA,"trial enterprises, in order that we may",48
NA,emerge from depression to prosperity.,48
NA,The Leader of the Opposition and bis,48
NA,friends opposite have suggested that this,48
NA,action of the Commonwealth Bank in,48
NA,issuing treasury-bills to tbe public is a,48
NA,sinister move to contract the amount of,48
NA,credit available for industry. I deny that,48
NA,absolutely. Neither the honorable gentle-,48
NA,man nor his friends have submitted evi-,48
NA,"dence to substantiate that charge. I f ,",48
NA,"however, at any time it is demonstrated",48
NA,that there is a downward tendency in the,48
NA,"re-employment figures, I for one will be",48
NA,prepared to join with any honorable,48
NA,member who will lead a crusade to find,48
NA,"employment for tbe people. That, I",48
NA,"suggest, is the supreme test of the policy",48
NA,of any government in this or any other,48
NA,"country. Tried by that test, this Govern-",48
NA,ment emerges triumphant.,48
NA,NA,48
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin),48
NA,and those honorable members who,48
NA,support the motion of censure have,48
NA,failed to make good their case against,48
NA,the Government or the Common-,48
NA,wealth. Bank. Other honorable mem-,48
NA,bers have pointed out that the issue of,48
NA,"£1,000,000 worth of treasury-bills is not",48
NA,a new proposal. I have every confidence,48
NA,in the Commonwealth Bank and the,48
NA,board which controls it. Its record,48
NA,of achievement is a sufficient answer,48
NA,to the charges made by the Xeader,48
NA,"of the Opposition. I n its personnel, tbe",48
NA,board is truly representative of all sec-,48
NA,"tions of the community, and no one can",48
NA,deny that it has always operated in the,48
NA,"best, interests of the people. I feel sure,",48
NA,"therefore, that it will do excellent work",48
NA,"in the future. Apparently, the Leader of",48
NA,"the Opposition, in submitting this motion",48
NA,"of censure, has taken the long view.",48
NA,Possibly he and his friends are looking,48
NA,forward to the time when they may be,49
NA,on the treasury bench and in a position,49
NA,to dictate the board's policy. I have a,49
NA,very vivid recollection of what happened,49
NA,a few years ago when there was a desire,49
NA,on the part of a number of Labour mem-,49
NA,bers to introduce a fiduciary note issue.,49
NA,There was an attempt to dictate to,49
NA,the Commonwealth Bunk Board. I,49
NA,"did not agree with that proposal, aud",49
NA,stated my reasons on the floor of the,49
NA,House. I am glad that at the time of,49
NA,"which I speak, the late Sir Robert Gibson",49
NA,was the Chairman of the Commonwealth,49
NA,"Bank Board, and successfully withstood",49
NA,the pressure that was put upon him. I,49
NA,shall do all in my power to prevent the,49
NA,Commonwealth Bank from being under,49
NA,political control.,49
Mr MARTENS ,Herbert) [8.58] -,49
NA,The right honorable member for North,49
NA,"Sydney ( Mr Hughes), in his defence of",49
NA,the Government from the charges con-,49
NA,tained in the motion of censure with,49
NA,respect to the policy of the Common-,49
NA,"wealth Bank, emphasized that the prin-",49
NA,ciples governing the bank are the same,49
NA,to-day as they were when it was estab-,49
NA,islied. I charge the right honorable,49
NA,"gentleman, in the first place, with having",49
NA,been opposed to the establishment of the,49
NA,"bank, and I go further and say that the",49
NA,policy of the bank hoard to-day is not on,49
NA,all-fours with its policy when the late Sir,49
NA,Denison Miller was in control. I also,49
NA,deny the charge that the Labour party,49
NA,is in favour of political control of the,49
NA,bank. At no time has this party been in,49
NA,favour of political control. But it is,49
NA,in favour of the bank business being con-,49
NA,ducted in legitimate'competition with the,49
NA,"private banks, as was the case when the",49
NA,late Sir Denison Miller was in control,49
NA,and would be to-day i f Sir Ernest,49
NA,Riddle had real authority to direct its,49
NA,policy. When I say that the bank should,49
NA,be in legitimate competition with private,49
NA,"trading banks, I have in mind an exten-",49
NA,sion of its activities by the establishment,49
NA,of branches throughout the Common-,49
NA,wealth. Some time ago I supported an,49
NA,"application for a branch in Gordon vale,",49
NA,"then in my electorate, but the stereotyped",49
NA,reply received was to the effect tbat ail,49
NA,tbe uecessary banking facilities were al-,49
NA,ready available to the people living in that,49
NA,district. At that time there was only a,49
NA,"savings bank in tbe district, but in con-",49
NA,sequence of suggestions made to the board,49
NA,there are now two banks. Similar con-,49
NA,"ditions existed at Ingham, where, in con-",49
NA,sequence of reliable statistics presented to,49
NA,"the Commonwealth Bank Board, inquiries",49
NA,were made and later the savings bank,49
NA,business was removed from the post office,49
NA,and a savings bank established at that,49
NA,town. Had it not been for the interest,49
NA,displayed by representative bodies in,49
NA,"those and other centres, and their con-",49
NA,"tinued agitation, proper banking facili-",49
NA,ties would not now exist.,49
Mr CURTIN ,Fremantle) [9.2] -I n,49
NA,the motion I submitted I did not level,49
NA,any charge against the Commonwealth,49
NA,"Bank, and tliere can be no conceivable",49
NA,implication of a charge against thaf,49
NA,institution in the speech whicli 1,49
NA,delivered. My charge is against tin,49
NA,"Government, and the Government's",49
NA,answer is that whatever action the Com-,49
NA,monwealth Bank Board has taken has,49
NA,been for purposes quite unrelated to tlu,49
NA,"reasons which, I conjectured, had",49
NA,impelled the bank to take action.,49
NA,I stated that during the last 30 months,49
NA,the balance of payments overseas swung,49
NA,"decidedly against Australia., and as i>",49
NA,result the reserves had been drawn upon,49
NA,"not for one or two months or one year,",49
NA,but almost uninterruptedly throughout,49
NA,the 30 months. For that period our,49
NA,reserves had been depleted so seriously,49
NA,that the position for this year could not,49
NA,be viewed other than apprehensively.,49
NA,Using the only data available to rue.,49
NA,"which was up to the end of January, or",49
NA,"seven months of the fiscal year, I made an",49
NA,estimate of the possible position at the,49
NA,end of June of this year. The only,49
NA,reply which the right honorable the Prime,49
NA,Minister ( Mr Lyons) has been capabh,49
NA,of making to that estimate of our probable,49
NA,"position, is that during the month oi",49
NA,February and the first week of Marcl,49
NA,there had been an extraordinary increase,49
NA,of the value of exports over the average,49
NA,"of the previous seven months, due to",49
NA,improved prices for wool and tbe increased,49
NA,sales of that commodity. I con-,49
NA,ceded in my speech that it was very pro-,49
NA,bable that the February figures woub',49
NA,"show an improvement in respect o'""",49
NA,exports over the average of the previou:,49
NA,seven months. Even after allowing for,49
NA,"such, increases, I still contend that the",50
NA,overseas trade of the Common wealth,50
NA,"during the present year, having regard to",50
NA,"the external obligations of Australia,",50
NA,involving continual strain upon our over-,50
NA,seas payments and reserve funds has,50
NA,impelled the Commonwealth Bank to take,50
NA,action because the Government itself,50
NA,failed to act. I put that forward as a,50
NA,reasonable hypothesis. Notwithstanding,50
NA,the fact that five Ministers have partici-,50
NA,pated in the debate in defence of the,50
NA,"Government, only one has attempted to",50
NA,explain why treasury-bills amounting to,50
NA,"£1,000,000 ' which the Commonwealth",50
NA,Bank now holds are to be made available,50
NA,"to the public, not in an open bill market,",50
NA,"but at a fixed rate, and only to those",50
NA,individuals in the community who are,50
NA,"capable of subscribing for £10,000 worth.",50
NA,Thus this restricted and limited issue at,50
NA,a higher rate of interest than could be,50
NA,secured if the money were placed on fixed,50
NA,"deposit, will inevitably have the conse-",50
NA,quence of hardening interest rates in Aus-,50
NA,tralia. Only one Minister has explained,50
NA,why it has been done. He stated that it,50
NA,has been done as an experiment in order,50
NA,to try out the reaction of the Australian,50
NA,public to the establishment of an open bill,50
NA,market. The Treasurer ( Mr Casey),50
NA,"declares that it is an experiment, but the",50
NA,"Minister for Health ( Mr Hughes), with",50
NA,"all his years of experience, says that the",50
NA,proposition is not novel. The,50
NA,honorable member regards it as a quite,50
NA,ordinary exercise of the bank's adminis-,50
NA,trative power. He knows that for,50
NA,some time treasury-bills have been,50
NA,taken up by the Commonwealth Bank,50
NA,Board as issued by the Commonwealth,50
NA,Government on its own behalf and on,50
NA,behalf of the States. Granting that the,50
NA,"issue to the public is an experiment, it",50
NA,would be interesting to know the neces-,50
NA,sity which exists for such an experiment-,50
NA,particularly at this juncture when the,50
NA,action being taken will necessarily so.,50
NA,"increase the interest, rate in Aus-",50
NA,tralia. What perspicacity do the,50
NA,members of the bank board possess,50
NA,if they did not know that the effect of,50
NA,issuing to the public this amount of,50
NA,money at the rate of interest prescribed,50
NA,would have a hardening effect upon inter-,50
NA,est rates? I did not make the charge that,50
NA,interest rates commenced to harden when,50
NA,Mr Curtin.,50
NA,this issue of treasury-bills was made,50
NA,available to the public. I carefully,50
NA,pointed out that from the time our Lon-,50
NA,don funds continued to be drawn upon,50
NA,because of excessive importations of,50
NA,unnecessary goods which we could not,50
NA,afford and which could be characterized,50
NA,"as luxuries, interest rates tended to",50
NA,decrease. The right honorable the Prime,50
NA,Minister discounted my figures for 30,50
NA,months by quoting the most recent,50
NA,"figures for February and March, and,",50
NA,"parenthetically, I ask why it is that a",50
NA,Commonwealth department should refuse,50
NA,to supply me with figures which are made,50
NA,available to the Prime Minister? I,50
NA,applied to the Commonwealth Statistician,50
NA,for the most recent figures upon this sub-,50
NA,"just because, as the Prime Minister was",50
NA,"good enough to acknowledge, it is not my",50
NA,practice to suppress available facts when,50
NA,discussing any subject in this Parliament.,50
NA,I submit that an explanation ought to,50
NA,be made by some one.,50
Mr CASEY ,Th e figures are compiled,50
NA,by the Department of Trade and Cus-,50
NA,"toms, and then made available to the",50
NA,Bureau of Census and Statistics. The,50
NA,figures referred to by the Leader of the,50
NA,Opposition were available in the Customs,50
NA,"Department, but at that time had not",50
NA,reached the Commonwealth Statistician.,50
Mr CURTIN ,Wh y should the,50
NA,right Department of Trade and Customs,50
NA,undertake the responsibility of being the,50
NA,purveyor of statistics even to Ministers?,50
NA,I have not the slightest doubt that the,50
NA,research which it was known that I was,50
NA,conducting impelled the Prime Minister,50
NA,to discover whether by whipping up the,50
NA,officers in some departments it would be,50
NA,possible to obtain information later than,50
NA,"that, which would be available to me.",50
Mr CASEY ,Th e statistical bureau is,50
NA,under my administration and I assure,50
NA,the Leader of the Opposition that is not,50
Mr CURTIN , I unreservedly accept,50
NA,the Treasurer's statement. I have every,50
NA,confidence in the impartiality of the,50
NA,Commonwealth Statistician's bureau,50
NA,and the sense of propriety which,50
NA,characterizes those who control it. I felt,50
NA,certain that when I asked for the latest,50
NA,information the bureau gave me the,50
NA,latest in its possession. But I was,50
NA,astonished to find that almost within a,51
NA,day or two of data having been supplied,51
NA,to me much later information was made,51
NA,available to the Prime Minister. My,51
NA,statement that the Loudon position can,51
NA,be regarded as having excited the concern,51
NA,of the Commonwealth Bank Board can,51
NA,be tested by examination of the amount,51
NA,of short-call funds held by the Common-,51
NA,wealth Bank Board in London. I wish,51
NA,to place on record the amounts of short-,51
NA,call funds available to the Common-,51
NA,wealth Bank in London on certain,51
NA,dates-no t the total amount held by the,51
NA,pool because there is a pooling arrange-,51
NA,ment under which the Commonwealth,51
NA,Bank has first call on available funds,51
NA,belonging to other banks. I am quoting,51
NA,only the funds which the Commonwealth,51
NA,"Bank had at short call. On June 25,",51
NA,"1934, the amount was £32,400,000; on",51
NA,"September 24, 1934, £27,800,000: on",51
NA,"December 25, 1934, £22,400,000; June",51
NA,"24, 1935, £15,100,000; December, 30,",51
NA,"1935, £12,900,000, and March 2, 1936,",51
NA,"£12,700,000. I was accused of not hav-",51
NA,ing the latest figures in regard to the,51
NA,London position. I f it is argued that,51
NA,this fall in the cash reserves of the Com-,51
NA,monweal th Bank in London is not a true,51
NA,reflection of the position of our reserves,51
NA,overseas the implication must be that,51
NA,while the funds held by the Common-,51
NA,wealth Bank itself were steadily falling,51
NA,as a result of the continual drain in con-,51
NA,"nexion with the payments for imports,",51
NA,by some astonishing piece of commercial,51
NA,alchemy the funds available to the,51
NA,private banks must have been increasing.,51
Mr CASEY ,Tha t is a fact.,51
Mr CURTIN ,Tha t is an ex-,51
NA,traordinary rejoinder in view of the,51
NA,significant paragraph in the latest report,51
NA,of the Commonwealth Bank Board just,51
NA,"tabled in Parliament, in which the board",51
NA,draws attention to the imports position.,51
NA,"Furthermore, a statement by the National",51
NA,"Bank was published only yesterday, sur-",51
NA,veying the possible explanations as to,51
NA,why the treasury-bill issue has been made,51
NA,available to the public. Despite,51
NA,"the oratory of five Ministers, no",51
NA,adequate explanation has been given to,51
NA,this Parliament concerning this proposal,51
NA,which the Treasurer says is an experi-,51
NA,ment. The honorable member for Parra-,51
NA,"matta ( Sir Frederick Stewart), who was",51
NA,"once a member of the Cabinet, does not",51
NA,accept tbe Treasurer's explanation.,51
NA,According to the Melbourne Star of tbe,51
NA,"l l t h March, the monthly summary of the",51
NA,National Bank makes the following,51
NA,comment:-,51
NA,In some quarters i t is lield tliat the Com-,51
NA,"monwealtli Hank, by making a public issue of",51
NA,"treasury-bills, lias inaugurated a chain of con-",51
NA,"sequences, including rising interest rates and",51
NA,a hardening in the money market. While,51
NA,"those things may happen, the dominating",51
NA,causes lie outside the Commonwealth Bank's,51
NA,action. They are to be found in rapid,51
NA,"utilization of"" bank lending resources in the",51
NA,last two years and the over-stimulation of,51
NA,imports which has resulted therefrom.,51
NA,I have never been in any way identified,51
NA,with the view of the private trading,51
NA,banks in Australia as against the,51
NA,banking and monetary policy of the party,51
NA,which I have the honour to lead; but,51
NA,when there has been need for a cold,51
NA,survey of the facts of our capitalistic,51
NA,"situation, I have never ignored the",51
NA,views of those competent to express an,51
NA,opinion. The explanation that this,51
NA,issue of treasury-bills is an experiment,51
NA,"conducted by the Commonwealth Bank,",51
NA,"regardless of consequences, simply will",51
NA,not go down. The Commonwealth Bank,51
NA,Board could not disregard the conse-,51
NA,quences. I believe that it would be the,51
NA,"last bank board which would wantonly, or",51
NA,"even experimentally, introduce a change",51
NA,of policy the immediate effect of which,51
NA,would be to hasten the hardening of,51
NA,"interest rates., particularly -when the",51
NA,hardening process had already com-,51
NA,menced. I f that is the explanation for,51
NA,"this issue of treasury-bills, then, indeed,",51
NA,"one can only say that, for the first time iu.",51
NA,"its long history, the Commonwealth Bank",51
NA,"Board has, in a whimsical and freakish",51
NA,"spirit, entered upon an experiment the",51
NA,immediate first consequence of which has,51
NA,been a disastrous reaction to interest,51
NA,rates in Australia. I refuse to hold the,51
NA,bank culpable on that ground. The,51
NA,Minister for Health ( Mr Hughes) enter-,51
NA,tained us to-night with a recital of the,51
NA,magnificent way in which the Common-,51
NA,"wealth Bank has served this country, and",51
NA,how it has always been free from political,51
NA,control. I seek no political control over,51
NA,the bank in the exercise of its administra-,51
NA,tive functions; but I submit that it is,51
NA,the duty of this Parliament to ensure,51
NA,that the bank is not compelled to resort,51
NA,"to a device, which, ia the best that it can",52
NA,"employ, to make good the deficiency occa-",52
NA,sioned by the Government's wanton dis-,52
NA,regard of its responsibilities. The right,52
NA,honorable gentleman says that there is nu,52
NA,serious position overseas; yet all the evi-,52
NA,dence available-the shrinkage of the,52
NA,London funds of the Commonwealth,52
NA,"Bank, the continuous increase of imports",52
NA,"into Australia, the swelling of customs",52
NA,"revenue, and the utilization of that",52
NA,revenue by the Government to reduce,52
NA,direct taxation in order to satisfy the,52
NA,chief political interests that it represents,52
NA,-go to show the contrary. The Govern-,52
NA,ment claims responsibility for the,52
NA,improvement that has taken place in fac-,52
NA,"tory employment, and in conditions",52
NA,"generally, and would have us believe that",52
NA,the situation is satisfactory; but I point,52
NA,"out that associated with that recovery,",52
NA,has been a definite exercise of inflationary,52
NA,credit in the Australian monetary system.,52
NA,It is conceivable that some authority-,52
NA,it may be either the Government or the,52
NA,Commonwealth Bank-has come to the,52
NA,conclusion that that movement towards,52
NA,"inflation, which commenced in 1931 in",52
NA,order to combat the worst effects of the,52
NA,"depression, has continued long enough.",52
NA,"The circular issued by the National Bank,",52
NA,"from which I have just quoted, refers",52
NA,"in specific terms to the "" over-stimulation",52
NA,"of imports"". Probably it meant the",52
NA,unwise expenditure by many Australian,52
NA,"people in the purchase of motor cars,",52
NA,thereby tending to create that unfavor-,52
NA,able balance between the United States of,52
NA,America and Australia to which the,52
NA,honorable member for Flinders ( Mr.,52
NA,Fairbairn) referred this afternoon as,52
NA,something that ought to be corrected. It-,52
NA,is clear to economists in Australia that,52
NA,"certain phases of expenditure., both public",52
NA,"and private, have reached a. stage",52
NA,"threatening a new credit boom, and it",52
NA,may be that steps are being taken to put,52
NA,some brake upon the inflation movement,52
NA,and the momentum which it has,52
NA,"generated. If that be the case, my",52
NA,accusation is that the Constitution,52
NA,imposes upon this Parliament the respon-,52
NA,sibility for determining the monetary,52
NA,policy of this country. Here I point out,52
NA,that monetary policy is a distinctly,52
NA,"different thing from bank management,",52
NA,"or the management of treasury-bills, or",52
NA,Mr Curtin.,52
NA,decisions as to whether or not Brown,52
NA,shall get credit which is refused to Jones.,52
NA,I deny-an d I hope that the country will,52
NA,regard my denial as emphatic;-tha t the,52
NA,"Labour party ever did, or does now, stand",52
NA,"for political interference witb banking,",52
NA,"as between bank and client. Further, I",52
NA,deny tbat this party has ever stood for,52
NA,interference with the Commonwealth,52
NA,Bank Board in the discharge of the func-,52
NA,tions of bank management. But when,52
NA,it comes to the rate of interest which,52
NA,"governments shall pay for credit, based",52
NA,"upon their own tax-collecting capacity,",52
NA,and to deciding whether or not credit,52
NA,shall be issued hy its own national instru-,52
NA,"mentality, on conditions favorable to the",52
NA,people or favorable to speculators and,52
NA,"investors, then I say, most definitely, that",52
NA,if the people of this country are to be,52
NA,"sovereign, their sovereignty must express",52
NA,itself in the national management of the,52
NA,credit structure of the nation.,52
Sir HENRY GULLETT ,Th e honorable,52
NA,memher is making a political speech.,52
Mr CURTIN ,A s an illustration to,52
NA,"the Minister, I point out that the educa-",52
NA,tion policy of a nation should be deter-,52
NA,"mined by the legislature, but the school-",52
NA,masters should be appointed by the,52
NA,department and the text-books prescribed,52
NA,"by its experts. I submit, further, that",52
NA,political responsibility for national policy,52
NA,is entirely different from the administra-,52
NA,tive agencies whereby that policy is car-,52
NA,ried out. Whatever has been the attitude,52
NA,of the people of Australia hitherto in,52
NA,regard to the limits of national control,52
NA,of banking and the dangers of political,52
NA,"interference, they had a rude awakening",52
NA,during the last fortnight when they dis-,52
NA,covered that an entire disregard of,52
NA,political responsibility on the part of the,52
NA,Commonwealth Government has exposed,52
NA,this country to an unnecessary increase of,52
NA,"interest rates, prejudicing industry and",52
NA,imperilling the recovery of the nation,52

NA,ZONE.,53
NA,OCCUPATION BY GERMAN TROOPS.,53
Mr CASEY ,Corio - Treasurer),53
NA,[9.31] -b y leave-Th e settlement of,53
NA,Germany's boundaries at tbe Versailles,53
NA,Conference constituted one of tbe funda-,53
NA,mental and one of tbe most difficult prob-,53
NA,lems to be solved.,53
NA,I n the interests of international peace,53
NA,France advocated strongly tbe erection of,53
NA,"a neutral State, to act as a buffer on the",53
NA,left bank of tbe Rhine. Unsuccessful in,53
NA,"this, France did obtain, without essential",53
NA,"difference of opinion, the demilitarization",53
NA,"of the left bank, that is, the area between",53
NA,the Rhine and the French and Belgian,53
NA,frontier. Germany also agreed not to,53
NA,maintain fortifications to the east of the,53
NA,"Rhine.in a zone thirty miles wide, and",53
NA,not to assemble armed forces or conduct,53
NA,manoeuvres in the whole demilitarized,53
NA,region. Any violation of these provisions,53
NA,ATES. was to be regarded as a hostile act against,53
NA,the signatory powers and as calculated to,53
NA,disturb the peace of the world. Articles,53
NA,"42, 43 and 44 of the Versailles treaty",53
NA,embody these principles.,53
NA,"Germany, on various grounds, includ-",53
NA,"ing injustice, a dictated peace, and self-",53
NA,"defence, has infringed several of the pro-",53
NA,"visions of the Versailles Peace Treaty,",53
NA,"notably those dealing with rearmament,",53
NA,"but German spokesmen have, at various",53
NA,NOBS.,53
NA,"times, expressly stated that Germany bad",53
NA,no intention of upsetting the status quo,53
NA,of the western frontiers as laid down i u,53
NA,the treaty. Emphasis was given to this,53
NA,by the German Government freely and,53
NA,"voluntarily negotiating the Locarno Pact,",53
NA,"which stabilized, by guarantee, the",53
NA,frontiers in Western Europe. This Pact,53
NA,"was signed i n December, 1925, and has",53
NA,been since regarded as the one clear and,53
NA,really valuable mutual treaty of security,53
NA,i n Europe.,53
NA,"By this Pact, the contracting parties,",53
NA,"namely, Great Britain , Belgium, France,",53
NA,Germany aud Italy guarantee to main-,53
NA,tain the territorial status quo resulting,53
NA,fro m the revised frontiers between Ger-,53
NA,many and Belgium and between Ger-,53
NA,"PAIRS. many and France, the inviolability of",53
NA,"those frontiers, and also the observance",53
NA,of stipulations concerning the demili-,53
NA,tarized zone of the Rhineland. This,53
NA,stabilization is the essence of the whole,53
NA,"Pact, the rest of which is designed to",53
NA,"effect this end. Germany, France and",53
NA,Belgium undertake to refrain f r o m mak-,53
NA,ing war on each other except i n self-,53
NA,"defence, and the violation of the demili-",53
NA,tarized zone is expressly mentioned as,53
NA,entitling France and Belgium to resort,53
NA,to war in self-defence.,53
NA,Article 4 especially affects Great,53
NA,"Britain , because Great B rita in and the",53
NA,"other signatories agree, i n the event of a",53
NA,violation of the Pact or a breach of the,53
NA,"demilitarization zone provision, to come",53
NA,immediately to the assistance of the State,53
NA,against whom the act of aggression is,53
NA,committed. But i t is to be noted that an,53
NA,alleged breach must be brought to the,53
NA,"notice of the League Council, and the",53
NA,guarantee operates when the Council is,53
NA,satisfied that a breach or violation has,53
NA,been committed. I n case of flagrant,53
NA,violation and where immediate defensive,53
NA,"steps are necessary, assistance is to be",53
NA,given at once if the powers are satisfied,54
NA,that the violation constitutes an unpro-,54
NA,"voked act of aggression. The ease, how-",54
NA,"ever, must still be referred to the Council,",54
NA,and the parties subsequently agree to act,54
NA,in accordance with the decision of the,54
NA,"Council, provided that it is concurred in",54
NA,by all members other than representatives,54
NA,of tlie parties which have engaged in,54
NA,hostilities. No time limit is fixed for the,54
NA,"period of the Pact, which also expressly",54
NA,states that it imposes no obligation on,54
NA,"any of the British Dominions, unless a",54
NA,dominion signifies its acceptance thereof.,54
NA,No dominion has accepted the obligation,54
NA,of Locarno.,54
NA,"Until 1935, there was no doubt as to",54
NA,Germany's intention to adhere to the Pact,54
NA,"of Locarno. On the 30th January, 1934,",54
NA,Herr Hitler himself made a public and,54
NA,"explicit, declaration in the Reichstag in",54
NA,tbe words:-,54
NA,The German Government is ready and,54
NA,"determined, after the solution of the",54
NA,"tion, to accept both the spirit and the letter",54
NA,"of the Locarno Pact, for there will then",54
NA,no territorial question between France,54
NA,Germany.,54
NA,At the beginning of 1935 there was,54
NA,evidence that Germany was beginning to,54
NA,chafe at the continuation of tbe demilito,54
NA,tarization of the Rhineland. On the 29th,54
NA,"May, 1935, the German Government proI",54
NA,"tested in a note to the guarantor powers,",54
NA,"that the Franco-Soviet Pact, signed on",54
NA,"2nd May, 1935, constituted an infringeunder",54
NA,"ment of the spirit of Locarno, mainly",54
NA,"i be ground that, although not specifically",54
NA,"stated, it was obviously directed against",54
NA,"Germany. After protesting that,",54
NA,"the Pact, France or Russia could take",54
NA,"action against Germany, even in a case",54
NA,where the League could not reach a,54
NA,"decision on the alleged act of aggression,",54
NA,the note went on to say that the Locarno,54
NA,Pact could not be modified by a treaty,54
NA,concluded with a third party by one,54
NA,tlie signatories.,54
NA,The British Secretary for Foreign,54
NA,Affairs replied to this note on the 5th,54
NA,"July, 1935, in the following words:-",54
NA,I have the honour to refer to the memor-,54
NA,andum which your Excellency was so good as,54
NA,"to hand my predecessor on the 29th May,",54
NA,in which were sot forth various considerations,54
NA,regarding the manner in which the Treaty of,54
NA,Locarno was. in the view of the German,54
NA,"vernment, affected hy the terms of the Franco-",54
NA,"Soviet Pact, of 2nd May. Since then",54
NA,Majesty's Government in the United,54
NA,Mr Casri;.,54
NA,have Had cugiiizancc of the note which the,54
NA,i icncii lioverniiient communicated lo tlie Ger-,54
NA,"man Government on the 25th June, in reply",54
NA,to this same memorandum.,54
NA,His Majesty's Government arc in entire,54
NA,agreement with the views expressed and the,54
NA,arguments used by the French Government in,54
NA,"Hi is note, and alter further consideration of",54
NA,the point* made by the German Government,54
NA,tliey are satisfied that there is nothing in the,54
NA,Franco-Soviet Treaty which cither conflicts,54
NA,with the Locarno Treaty or modifies its opera-,54
NA,tions in any way. They likewise agree with the,54
NA,French and German Governments in holding,54
NA,that the provisions of the Locarno Treaty,54
NA,cannot legally be modified or defined by the,54
NA,fact that a treaty has been concluded with a,54
NA,third party by one of the signatories.,54
NA,As this Franco-Russian treaty is,54
NA,regarded by Germany as the justification,54
NA,"for the repudiation of the Locarno Pact,",54
NA,it is of interest to note its main features.,54
NA,"By this treaty, Soviet Russia and France",54
NA,"undertake, in the event of a threat of",54
NA,"aggression by any European State, to con-",54
NA,sult as to common measures to be taken,54
NA,Saar queswithin the framework of the League,54
NA,exist Covenant. I n the event of an unprovoked,54
NA,and aggression on the part of any European,54
NA,"State, each shall come to the other's aid",54
NA,"and assistance. Further, in case of un-",54
NA,provoked aggression there is an obligation,54
NA,lend each other aid and assistance in,54
NA,application of article 16 of the Covenant.,54
NA,t is this provision to which Germany,54
NA,"particularly objects, as by it, i f unani-",54
NA,the mity cannot be obtained in the Council,54
NA,"article 15, and members thereby",54
NA,"on are freed from the Covenant obligation,",54
NA,France and Russia are still bound to,54
NA,assist each other in implementing the,54
NA,under sanctions under article 16.,54
NA,"The French Government, aware of",54
NA,"possible objections, was particularly care-",54
NA,ful to work out a text within the prin-,54
NA,ciples of the League Covenant and in,54
NA,harmony with France's international,54
NA,"of commitments, especially Locarno.",54
NA,A non-aggression pact of mutual assist-,54
NA,"ance, similar to the Franco-Soviet Treaty,",54
NA,was also recently entered into between,54
NA,Soviet Russia and Czechoslovakia.,54
NA,Although the Franco-Soviet Pact was,54
NA,"and signed in May, 1935, it was not to come",54
NA,into operation until ratifications were,54
NA,exchanged at Moscow. France has,54
NA,Godelayed ratification in the hope that the,54
NA,"His "" air pact"", known as the Aerial Locarno",54
NA,"Kingdom Pact, the Eastern Pact, and the Danubian",54
NA,"Pact, as proposed i n the London Declara-",55
NA,"tion of February, 1935, w^uld be nego-",55
NA,"tiated, and thereby lead to a general all-",55
NA,round pacification and settlement of out-,55
NA,standing differences. The intrusion of,55
NA,"tbe Italo-Abyssinian disrmte however,",55
NA,"affected the whole situation, and added",55
NA,to the prevailing unrest and uncertainty,55
NA,in Etirope. Despite repeated efforts on,55
NA,"the part of Great Britain , it was found",55
NA,impossible to make any advance with the,55
NA,"proposed pacts, as all States were unwill-",55
NA,ing to commit themselves to further inter-,55
NA,national obligations unti l the Abyssinian,55
NA,conflict was ended and clanger of a,55
NA,European conflagration had passed.,55
NA,"Consequently, France, with a growing",55
NA,uneasiness i n the face of German rearma-,55
NA,"ment, felt i t incumbent upon i t to proceed",55
NA,with the ratification of the Soviet,55
NA,Treaty. I t had passed the Chamber of,55
NA,Deputies and appeared most likely to be,55
NA,"approved by the Senate, when Germany",55
NA,announced its repudiation of the Locarno,55
NA,"Pact, and moved armed forces into the",55
NA,demilitarized zone on the 9th March.,55
NA,Despite the fact that the terms of,55
NA,"Soviet Pact were known i n May, 1935,",55
NA,and that Germany's objections to i t had,55
NA,not received support f r o m the other,55
NA,"Locarno guarantors, Germany subseconsider",55
NA,quently re-affirmed its intention to observe,55
NA,"the Locarno Pact. Herr Hitler, i n his",55
NA,"review of policy on the 2nd May, 1935..",55
NA,reiterated his assurance that now the,55
NA,"Saar issue was settled, Germany would,",55
NA,give no cause for French anxiety about,55
NA,the eastern frontier. On the 28th,55
NA,"February, 1936, he again declared that,",55
NA,"as there were no outstanding differences,",55
NA,be desired the friendship of France. The of,55
NA,representatives of Great Britain were the,55
NA,last week endeavouring to obtain some,55
NA,indication of Germany's views on the proGerman,55
NA,"posed London Declaration Pacts, particuconflicts",55
NA,larly in regard to the A i r Pact- a proplay,55
NA,"posal to supplement the Locarno Pact,",55
NA,the rendering of mutual assistance i n case,55
NA,of unprovoked air attack. The action of might,55
NA,Germany on the 9th March consequently,55
NA,cut right across these conversations ancl,55
NA,created a situation which i n gravity ancl,55
NA,importance overshadows all other inter-,55
NA,national issues at the moment.,55
NA,I do not propose to review the proposals,55
NA,submitted by the German Government,55
NA,"for a new settlement, as they were f u l l y",55
NA,reported i n the press. I t would be,55
NA,"unwise, moreover, to offer any comment",55
NA,"at the present juncture, as the issues",55
NA,raised therein are primaril y the concern,55
NA,"of the Locarno Powers, although the",55
NA,principle of the sanctity of treaties is one,55
NA,which profoundly affects the international,55
NA,relations of every State.,55
NA,"The French and Belgian governments,",55
NA,with the f u l l knowledge and agreement of,55
NA,"the United Kingdom Government, have",55
NA,asked that the Council of the League may,55
NA,be summoned as soon as possible to con-,55
NA,"sider the situation, and i t is understood",55
NA,"that the Council w i l l meet on Saturday,",55
NA,"the 14th March, i n London, instead of",55
NA,"its usual venue, Geneva. The Treaty",55
NA,"of Locarno lays down that, i n the event",55
NA,"of an alleged breach, this course shall be",55
NA,followed.,55
NA,Three courses appear to be open to the,55
NA,Council. I t may deal with the question,55
NA,"direct, and i n this connexion i t is to be",55
NA,noted that any opinion given by the,55
NA,Council on the dispute must be unani-,55
NA,"the mous. Secondly, the question may be",55
NA,referred to the committee which was,55
NA,appointed as a result of tbe special meet-,55

NA,the French petition regarding,55

NA,"was carried unanimously, and declares-",55
NA,That as the scrupulous respect of all treaty,55

NA,"peace, and as i t is an essential principle of",55

NA,contracting States must be obtained for libera-,55
NA,"tion from treaty obligations, and as the",55
NA,"military law of the Kith March, 1935,",55
NA,"with these principles, decides that",55
NA,such repudiation of treaties sliould call into,55
NA,"appropriate measures by League members,",55
NA,by and requests a committee to propose what,55
NA,"measures, particularly financial and economic,",55
NA,be applied should any State in future,55

NA,SECOND READING.,56
Mr THORBY ,Calare-Actin g Minisdelay,56
NA,ter for Commerce) [0.48] - I move-,56
NA,That tbe bill be now read a second time.,56
NA,The purpose of this bill is to provide,56
NA,financial assistance for wheat-growers,56
NA,with respect to the 1935-36 harvest. Each,56
NA,"year, since the sharp decliue in wheat",56
NA,"prices in 1930, financial assistance has",56
NA,been provided by various governments for,56
NA,wheat-growers. This assistance has been,56
NA,granted because it is realized that the,56
NA,prosperity of the wheat industry is enor-,56
NA,mously important to Australia. The,56
NA,industry engages the principal attention,56
NA,"of over 70,000 farmers, and its products",56
NA,are second in importance only to wool,56
NA,Australia's export trade.,56
NA,The trials and difficulties of the,56
NA,tralian wheat-farmer have in recent,56
NA,years been constantly before the Govern-,56
NA,"ment, and in 1933 a royal commission was",56
NA,appointed to investigate the problem of,56
NA,the industry with a view to recommending,56
NA,a more suitable basis for its operation,56
NA,than the yearly grant of assistance from,56
NA,"Government funds. That commission, in",56
NA,"its second report, indicated inter alia that",56
NA,the plan which promised the most perma-,56
NA,nent relief to the industry was one based,56
NA,upon the principle of a home-consump-,56
NA,tion price. This Government took the,56
NA,first available opportunity to implement,56
NA,the recommendations of the commission,56
NA,"in this connexion. I n October, 1935, it",56
NA,called a conference in Canberra of repre-,56
NA,of all parties interested in the,56
NA,1936. wheat industry. Following upon the,56
NA,deliberations and suggestions emanating,56
NA,"from that conference, the Australian",56
NA,Council unanimously,56
NA,decided to recommend the Commonwealth,56
NA,and the various State governments to,56
NA,introduce legislation having for its object,56
NA,a bill the provision of a home-consumption,56
NA,Tho Commonwealth,56
NA,Government duly honoured its obligations,56
NA,"in this respect by passing, in December,",56
NA,"1935, its Wheat and Wheat Products",56
NA,Act. Before the plan of that measure,56
NA,"could he brought into effective operation,",56
NA,"however, it was necessary for legislation",56
NA,prepare in accordance with the Agricultural,56
NA,Council's decision to be passed by the,56
NA,various State parliaments.,56
NA,Only three State parliaments passed,56
NA,such legislation. As the result of the,56
NA,by the other parliaments it was not,56
NA,found possible to put the plan into opera-,56
NA,tion for this year's harvest. At the con-,56
NA,ference referred to the Commonwealth,56
NA,Government gave an undertaking to the,56
NA,effect that i f it were not found possible,56
NA,to bring the home-consumption price plan,56
NA,"into operation for this year's harvest, the",56
NA,"flour tax .would be re-enacted, and finan-",56
NA,cial assistance rendered to wheat-growers,56
NA,from funds derived from that source.,56
NA,The prices ruling for wheat for this,56
NA,season's harvest have been consistently,56
NA,higher than has been the case for the,56
NA,past few years. The prices obtaining in,56
NA,i n the three months December to February,56
NA,this year are better to the extent of about,56
NA,AusIs. per bushel than those which obtained,56
NA,for the same period last year.,56
Mr MAHONEY ,Wha t is the present,57
NA,price ?,57
Mr THORBY ,Abou t 3s. 7d. a as follows:-,57
NA,bushel. I f this difference is maintained,57
NA,the increase in the total cheque received,57
NA,by the growers this year as compared with,57
NA,"last year will be between £5,000,000 and",57
NA,"£6,000,000. The shippers' limits for",57
NA,wheat f.o.r. Williamstown during the,57
NA,three months December to February in,57
NA,the years 1934-35 and 1935-36 compare,57
NA,as follows:-,57
NA,1934-35 .. .. 2 U i 2 4,57
NA,11)33-30 . . . . 3 10,57
NA,These higher prices this year are,57
NA,to an improvement in the world statistivision,57
NA,cal position of wheat.,57
NA,In briefly surveying this position,57
NA,find that up to the year 1926 the average,57
NA,carry-over at the 1st August was about,57
NA,"660,000,000 bushels. I n 1928 there was",57
NA,an abnormally large crop in the chief,57
NA,"wheat-exporting countries, and for some",57
NA,years afterwards the crops were above,57
NA,average. The result was that on the 1st,57
NA,"August, 1934, the wheat carry-over had",57
NA,"increased to about 1,140,000,000 bushels.",57
NA,I n 1934-35 and'again in .1935-36 bad sea-,57
NA,"sons were experienced in North America,",57
NA,"and low yields resulted. I n 1935-36,",57
NA,the crop in Argentina was attacked by,57
NA,drought and was the lowest on record for,57
NA,very many years. The result of these,57
NA,poor harvests has been that on the 1st,57
NA,"August, 1935, the world carry-over was",57
NA,"reduced to about S75,000,000 bushels. I",57
NA,seems probable that that figure will,57
NA,"still further reduced at the 1st August,",57
NA,".1936-probabl y to less than 700,000,000",57
NA,"bushels. Taking a line from this,",57
NA,seems likely that prices this year will,57
NA,maintained at a higher level than for,57
NA,several years past.,57
NA,"As honorable members are aware, the",57
NA,Flour Tax Act was re-enacted in order,57
NA,to provide a fund to assist wheat-growers,57
NA,pending the operation of the home-contralian,57
NA,sumption price legislation. The bill now,57
NA,before the House embodies the Governyield,57
NA,ment's proposals in regard to the distribuWestern,57
NA,tion of relief to the growers. The total,57
NA,amount provided in the bill for distribu-,57
NA,"tion is £1,878,906. I t is proposed to make",57
NA,this sum available by way of grants,57
NA,"the various States which will, in turn,",57
NA,effect the distribution amongst the,57
NA,growers. The amount has been allocated,57
NA,£,57

NA,crop in each State which is equivalent to,57
NA,we the proportion of the total crop in Aus-,57

NA,This does not mean that growers are to,57

NA,consumption quota. I t is simply a basis,57
NA,for calculating the amount to be paid,57
NA,to each State for wheat-growers' relief.,57
NA,The latest estimate of the total crop is,57
NA,"about 140,000,000 bushels. The quan-",57
NA,tity required for human consumption in,57
NA,"too, Australia is about 32,000,000 bushels,",57
NA,"which represeLts 23 per cent, of the total",57
NA,crop. The allocation under this heading,57
NA,"will therefore absorb £1,610,103. The",57
NA,"balance of £268,803 has been distributed",57
NA,amongst the States on the basis of the,57
NA,t degree of adverse seasonal conditions ex-,57
NA,be perienced. From the information avail-,57
NA,"able, Western Australia has suffered in",57
NA,this regard more than any other State.,57
NA,it To indicate the extent to which that,57
NA,be State has been affected in comparison,57
NA,"with the rest of the Commonwealth, I",57
NA,shall quote some crop figures for the past,57
NA,"few years. I n 1933, the total harvest",57
NA,"in Australia was 177,337,S03 bushels from",57
NA,"14,901,271 acres-a n average yield of",57
NA,11.9 bushels an acre. The Western Aus-,57
NA,"contribution was 37,305,100",57
NA,"bushels from 3,183,216 acres-a n average",57
NA,of 11.7 bushels an acre. The,57
NA,Australian yield for this year i3,57
NA,"estimated at just over 20,000,000 bushels",57
NA,-a n average of just over 8 bushels an,57
NA,"acre, compared with 11.8 bushels an acre",57
NA,to for the Commonwealth. An amount of,57
NA,"£161,600 has accordingly been allotted to",57
NA,"Western Australia from the £26S,803 pro-",58
NA,"vided in this connexion. Of the balance,",58
NA,"South Australia has been allotted £69,896,",58
NA,"and New South Wales, £31,784. Tbe",58
NA,balance will be divided amongst the other,58
NA,States on an acreage basis. The bill pro-,58
NA,vides that payments may be made by the,58
NA,States to individual wheat-growers on any,58
NA,basis deemed reasonable in the circum-,58
NA,"stances existing in the respective States,",58
NA,subject to the proposed method of dis-,58
NA,tribution being first approved by the,58
NA,Commonwealth Minister. The reason for,58
NA,this provision is that the circumstances,58
NA,each case are so different that it would,58
NA,"be impossible for this Parliament to pass,",58
NA,a bill setting out an exact and equitable,58
NA,basis upon whioh the distributions should,58
NA,be made in the respective States. I wish,58
NA,"to refer briefly, however, to the methods",58
NA,by which the various State governments,58
NA,propose to distribute the grant. The,58
NA,Government of New South Wales intends,58
NA,to distribute the greater part of the,58
NA,money on an acreage basis. Approxi-,58
NA,"mately £93,000 will be used for relief of",58
NA,wheat-growers who suffered serious loss,58
NA,through adverse seasonal conditions.,58
NA,The proposal of the Government,58
NA,of New South Wales is that all,58
NA,wheat-growers will get so much on an,58
NA,acreage basis. Those who have suffered,58
NA,through drought conditions will get in-,58
NA,creasing amounts according to loss or,58
NA,smaller returns from harvesting. I n,58
NA,"other words, it will be worked on a slid-",58
NA,"ing scale, taking the average crop returns",58
NA,for New South Wales over the last ten,58
NA,years as a basis. A l l who receive the,58
NA,average return or more will receive pay-,58
NA,ment on an acreage basis. Eor every,58
NA,bushel for which they receive a return,58
NA,"below the average, farmers will receive",58
NA,an increased amount. The unit will be,58
NA,decided by dividing the total amount of,58
NA,money available by the number of farmers,58
NA,whose returns show less than the average.,58
NA,The method may appear complicated,58
NA,"when expressed in words, but on paper i t",58
NA,is simple. I see no reason why we should,58
NA,not approve of the method as far as New,58
NA,South Wales is concerned.,58
Mr CURTIN ,Doe s not the bill leave,58
NA,it competent for the States to vary any,58
NA,measures that they have to pass?,58
Mr THORBY ,No . I have already,58
NA,explained that the bill provides that the,58
NA,States shall submit their methods of dis-,58
NA,tribution to the Commonwealth for,58
NA,approval.,58
Mr CURTIN ,Wil l not the States have,58
NA,to pass legislation?,58
Mr THORBY ,Eac h State has,58
NA,already submitted the proposed basis upon,58
NA,which it proposes to distribute the money.,58
Mr CURTIN ,Supposin g a State has,58
NA,difficulty in passing the bill in a form,58
NA,which has met with the approval of the,58
NA,"Minister, what happens then?",58
Mr THORBY ,I t is not my inten-,58
NA,"tion, nor is it the intention of the Com-",58
NA,"in monwealth, to impose unreasonable condi-",58
NA,tions on any State i n connexion with this,58
NA,money. We are concerned only with,58
NA,the broad principles. I t would be,58
NA,unreasonable to ask this Parliament to,58
NA,"pass a distribution of about £1,880,000 to",58
NA,the States without having some indication,58
NA,of how the money was to be distributed,58
NA,among the wheat-growers.,58
NA,Victoria has decided to distribute,58
NA,"£50,000 amongst growers who suffered",58
NA,"losses through drought, hail, storm and",58
NA,"other damage, approximately £200,000",58
NA,on an acreage basis and the balance of the,58
NA,grant on a production basis.,58
Mr MCEWEN ,Wh y such a small,58
NA,amount for adverse seasonal conditions in,58
NA,Victoria?,58
Mr THORBY ,Eo r the reason that,58
NA,the area affected by drought in Victoria,58
NA,is very small compared with the drought-,58
NA,affected area in New South Wales.,58
NA,"Queensland will distribute 25 per cent,",58
NA,of the grant to wheat-growers suffering,58
NA,"from specially adverse conditions, and the",58
NA,balance on an acreage basis.,58
NA,-South Australia proposes to distribute,58
NA,the amount specially added to that State's,58
NA,grant in respect of adverse seasonal con-,58
NA,ditions to those farmers who reaped three,58
NA,bushels an acre and under. The balance,58
NA,of the money will probably be distributed,58
NA,"50 per cent, on an acreage basis and 50",58
NA,"per cent, on a bushel basis.",58
NA,Western Australia proposes to distri-,58
NA,bute the amounts specially added to that,58
NA,State's grant in respect of the adverse,58
NA,seasonal conditions as sustenance to those,58
NA,growers who suffered losses through,58
NA,"drought, whilst the balance will be paid",58
NA,on an acreage basis.,58
NA,Tasmania will distribute the money on,58
NA,an acreage basis.,58
NA,"I might point out, so far as Tasmania",58
NA,"is concerned, the areas concerned are",58
NA,"small, and it is not a vital matter to that",59
NA,"State, although I concede it is a matter",59
NA,of importance to the wheat-growers them-,59
NA,selves.,59
NA,As certain of the States propose,59
NA,tribute some of the money as a bonus per,59
NA,bushel of production it will be necessary,59
NA,for both Houses of this Parliament to,59
NA,pass a resolution empowering the States,59
NA,"to pay a bounty on production, where",59
NA,"they desire to do so, out of the funds",59
NA,vided under this legislation. A resolu-,59
NA,tion to this effect will be submitted as,59
NA,soon as the present bill has passed,59
NA,through all stages.,59
NA,I have previously referred to the source,59
NA,of the funds to provide for these pay-,59
NA,"ments. The flour tax of £2 12s. 6d.""a",59
NA,ton was re-enacted for this purpose. The,59
NA,revenue derived from this tax was esti-,59
NA,"mated to produce about £1,600,000. As a",59
NA,result of representations made to it and,59
NA,particularly of the buoyancy of the,59
NA,revenue the Government decided to dis-,59
NA,continue the flour tax as from the 25th,59
NA,"February, 1936. The total revenue",59
NA,derived from the tax will be about,59
NA,"£1,200,000. The balance of approxi-",59
NA,"mately £680,000 will, therefore, have to be",59
NA,provided from revenue.,59
NA,I hope that this is the last occasion on,59
NA,which an appeal will be made to honor-,59
NA,able members to provide this form of,59
NA,financial assistance for the wheat,59
NA,industry.,59
Mr ROSEVEAR ,W e have heard that,59
NA,for the last four years.,59
Mr THORBY ,Tha t does not make,59
NA,the wish any the less sincere.,59
NA,As I previously mentioned three of the,59
NA,States have passed legislation necessary,59
NA,to give effect to the home-consumption,59
NA,"price plan, whilst two States have intro-",59
NA,"duced the necessary legislation, but have",59
NA,not proceeded with it beyond the first-,59
NA,"reading stage. I have confidence, how-",59
NA,"ever, that the plan will be brought into",59
NA,effective operation in sufficient time to,59
NA,enable it to be applied effectively at least 1935.,59
NA,to next season's harvest. Meantime the,59
NA,proposals in this bill should commend,59
NA,themselves to the House as the best avail-,59
NA,able for assisting an industry which re-,59
NA,quires it and which is of such vital im-,59

NA,That the bill be now read a second time.,59
NA,"Under the Financial Relief Act 1934,",59
NA,provision was made for payment; of a,59
NA,subsidy of 15s. a ton on all artificial,59
NA,manures used for purposes other than,59
NA,wheat-growing during the year ended the,59
NA,"SOth June, 1935. The closing date for",59
NA,making applications for the subsidy was,59
NA,"fixed at the 31st October, 1935. Unfortu-",59
NA,"nately, a number of farmers failed to",59
NA,submit their applications within the time,59
NA,"laid down, and requests have been",59
NA,made on their behalf for payment of the,59
NA,subsidy. After full consideration of all,59
NA,"the circumstances, the Government has",59
NA,decided to extend the closing date for,59
NA,applications in respect of the 1934-35,59
NA,"subsidy to the 30th April, 1936. This",59
NA,will involve an additional expenditure of,59
NA,"approximately £5,000.",59
NA,The other amendment in respect of this,59
NA,year's fertilizer subsidy simply provides,59
NA,for the elimination of the total estimated,59
NA,amount to be paid in respect of fertilizers,59
NA,"used in the year ended the 30th June,",59
NA,Considerable difficulty is ex-,59
NA,perienced in estimating the araouuts to,59
NA,be paid under this scheme during the,59
NA,"currency of a year, and it is considered",59
NA,preferable to make the estimate of,59
NA,expenditure when more definite informa-,59
NA,"tion is available, and to make provision",59
NA,"on the. Estimates for such, expenditure.",59
NA,"The act, as I have said, fixed the 31st",59
NA,"October, 1935, as the closing date for the",60
NA,receipt of applications. I n tbe previous,60
NA,year the date fixed was the 30th Novem-,60
NA,ber. Considerable confusion was thereby,60
NA,caused in the minds of those who were,60
NA,likely to apply for the subsidy in the,60
NA,"ordinary course, while, in addition, quite",60
NA,a number of wheat-growers did not know,60
NA,by the 3lst October whether they would,60
NA,be harvesting their crop for grain or,60
NA,cutting it for hay. I f it were cut for hay,60
NA,they would be entitled to claim the sub-,60
NA,"sidy, but if it were harvested for grain",60
NA,they would be disentitled to it.,60
Mr BEASLEY ,Wh y does not the bill,60
NA,state the amount which is likely to be,60
NA,involved ?,60
Mr THORBY ,I t is utterly impos-,60
NA,sible either for me or for anybody else,60
NA,to say exactly how much will be required,60
NA,to the end of any given year.,60
Mr WARD ,"How , then, was i t possible",60
NA,to state a definite amount in the act?,60
Mr THORBY ,I t was an estimated,60
NA,amount.,60
Mr WARD ,Wh y is not a similar reported.,60
NA,course followed on this occasion ?,60
Mr THORBY ,I t is very difficult,60
NA,estimate even approximately the amount,60
NA,that will be needed. Where a definite,60
NA,amount a ton is specified it is quite unof,60
NA,necessary to fix the total amount to be for,60
NA,distributed. We do not know how many,60
NA,tons are to be used until the whole of the,60
NA,applications are received. I t is then too,60
NA,late to ask for parliamentary appropriation adopted.,60
NA,tion.,60
NA,Mr BEAST.EY -Th e Minister must,60
NA,have an idea of the acreage involved.,60
Mr THORBY ,Eve n i f I knew the going resolution.,60
NA,exact acreage that is to have fertilizer,60
NA,"applied to it, which I do not, it would read a first time.",60
NA,be impossible for me or any authority,60
NA,to calculate the quantity that would be,60
NA,used to the acre. Every farmer uses a,60
NA,"different quantity to the acre, and vary-",60
NA,ing quantities are used for different,60
NA,"Then, too, many farmers who purchase",60
NA,superphosphate might not use it within,60
NA,"the prescribed period, and thus would not",60
NA,be entitled to the subsidy.,60
Mr BEASLEY ,Th e extra amount fertilizers,60
NA,"might be £20,000.",60
Mr THORBY ,"It , cannot be £20,000.",60
NA,The point to be considered is tbat Parliabe,60
NA,ment has already agreed to the payment,60
NA,of a subsidy of 15s. a ton irrespective,60
NA,"the number of tons used, tbe object being",60
NA,to encourage primary producers to use,60
NA,superphosphate or other fertilizers with,60
NA,a view to increasing the yield of the,60
NA,various crops that are being cultivated,60
NA,throughout the Commonwealth. That,60
NA,"principle having been approved, i t is",60
NA,illogical to argue that the total amount,60
NA,"should be fixed, for the simple reason",60
NA,"that i f insufficient money were voted, no",60
NA,funds would be available to pay the last,60
NA,"applicants, although they would be en-",60

Mr FROST ,Franklin) [10.22] - I,61
NA,ask the Government to give favorable con-,61
NA,sideration to the granting of a pension to,61
NA,the widow of the late Honorable W.,61
NA,"J. MCWilliams, who, for over 20",61
NA,"years, represented the Franklin elec-",61
NA,torate in this House. At the last,61
NA,election which he contested he unfortun-,61
NA,ately took i l l ancl his death took place,61
NA,during the afternoon of the clay upon,61
NA,which his election to the Franklin seat,61
NA,"was declared. His widow, who was left",61
NA,"in poor circumstances, has endeavoured",61
NA,to carry on since then but has had a,61
NA,difficult time in making ends meet. The,61
NA,late Mr MCWilliams was a good living,61
NA,and conscientious man who reared a large,61
NA,family. He followed the pursuit of,61
NA,"farming, but during the depression lost",61
NA,most of the money which he had been able,61
NA,"to save, with the result that his widow",61
NA,has been living in distressed circumstances,61
NA,since his death. Already a precedent,61
NA,for the granting of my request exists and,61
NA,I urge the Government to give sym-,61
NA,pathetic consideration to the claims of,61
NA,Mrs MCWilliams for some compassionate,61
NA,allowance.,61
Mr WARD ,East Sydney) [10.25] -,61
NA,During the last sittings of the Parlia-,61
NA,"ment, when the granting of service pen-",61
NA,"sions was being discussed, honorable",61
NA,"members and the public generally, par-",61
NA,"ticularly the returned soldiers affected,",61
NA,were given the impression that the recipi-,61
NA,ents of such pensions and their wives,61
NA,would not suffer any reduction in respect,61
NA,of other pensions received by them from,61
NA,the Government. I t was understood that,61
NA,"ex-soldiers, legally entitled to receive the",61
NA,"service pension, would not have their",61
NA,income or assistance from any other Go-,61
NA,vernment sources interfered with in any,61
NA,way. I bring under notice tbe case of,61
NA,an ex-soldier suffering from tuberculosis,61
NA,"who, at different times, has been an",61
NA,inmate of the Boddington Sanatorium,61
NA,and the Prince of Wales Hospital at,61
NA,"Randwick, and was in receipt of an",61
NA,"invalid, but not a military pension. He",61
NA,applied for a service pension. After a,61
NA,good deal of delay by the department in,61
NA,"the consideration of his application, be",61
NA,SERVICE was notified that he had been granted a,61
NA,"service pension of 10s. a fortnight, and",61
NA,he naturally thought that it would be,61
NA,"supplementary to the invalid pension, and",61
NA,would bring his total pension up to 23s.,61
NA,a week. But on the day he received the,61
NA,notification of the granting of the service,61
NA,"pension, he also received a communica-",61
NA,tion from the Pensions Department in-,61
NA,"forming him that, owing to the granting",61
NA,"of the service pension, his invalid pension",61
NA,had been reduced from 36s. to 25s. a fort-,61
NA,night. The result is that this man is now,61
NA,receiving a total of Is. a fortnight less,61
NA,than he formerly received as invalid,61
NA,"pension alone, i f that is the manner in",61
NA,which tbe Government proposes to assist,61
NA,"these unfortunate returned soldiers, in-",61
NA,stead of this Parliament being called upon,61
NA,to appropriate moneys to provide for,61
NA,"service pensions, it will be found the sur-",61
NA,plus accruing from the savings effected,61
NA,by the reduction of other pensions will,61
NA,more than offset the cost of the service,61
NA,pensions.,61
NA,I have had brought under my notice,61
NA,the case of another returned soldier who,61
NA,"applied for a service pension, but whose",61
NA,"application was rejected. His wife, who",61
NA,"was receiving an invalid pension, was",61
NA,informed by the Pensions Depart-,61
NA,"ment that, owing to the fact that",61
NA,her liusband liad been granted a service,62
NA,"pension, her invalid pension would i",62
NA,future be reduced from 36s. to 29s. 9d. a loss.,62
NA,fortnight.,62
NA,"I am sure that, when the proposal",62
NA,regard to service pensions was first,62
NA,"brought forward, every honorable member",62
NA,understood that when such a pension was,62
NA,granted other pensions granted to a service pension.,62
NA,the ex-soldier or his wife would,62
NA,"not be interfered with. I t appears now,",62
NA,"however, that the Government is giving",62
NA,with one hand and taking away,62
NA,"other, and that the soldiers are not to",62
NA,obtain any benefits f r o m the amended,62
NA,legislation. I have not cited names i n the,62
NA,"two cases which I have mentioned, because",62
NA,I have not yet obtained the permission,62
NA,the persons concerned to do so. I ask,62
NA,"the. Government, however, to indicate",62
NA,exactly its policy i n regard to service,62
NA,pensions. Is the department carrying,62
NA,"out the instructions of the Government,",62
NA,"or has i t not, understood the Government's",62
NA,"directions? A t an early date, the M i",62
NA,ister should give an indication of the employment.,62
NA,Government's wishes i n regard to,62
NA,the granting of service pensions.,62
NA,When this matter was previously,62
NA,under the consideration of,62
NA,"Parliament, I was not one of those who",62
NA,"complimented the Government, because I",62
NA,always am wary of legislation introduced,62
NA,"by anti-Labour administrations, particurequest",62
NA,larly when i t is made to appear that they this sitting.,62
NA,are prepared to assist deserving sections,62
NA,of the community. The present attitude,62
NA,of the Government i n 'regard to service,62
NA,pensions shows that my suspicions wer?,62
NA,"well founded, and that i t does not intend",62
NA,to assist returned soldiers i n any way.,62
NA,"it wished to do so, i t could give instrucappealing",62
NA,"tions to the department that, when sersupport",62
NA,"vice pensions are granted, ex-soldiers",62
NA,their dependants should not suffer lo3S,62

NA,orable member for East Sydney ( Mr unsuccessfully for a,62

NA,who are also granted service pensions,62
NA,have their invalid pension reduced. When,62
NA,the bill to amend the Repatriation Act not,62

Mr GARDEN ,Cook) [10.35] - I have,62
NA,my attention one or two,62
NA,cases cases of men who have been on,62
NA,service and have applied,62
NA,service pen-,62
NA,sion. One of them has been bedridden for,62
NA,nearly two years. He is suffering f r o m,62
NA,"rheumatism, but he is told that this is",62
NA,a disability arising f r o m war service.,62
NA,Although he gave excellent service f or,62
NA,"1,045 days, the department has informed",62
NA,that i t was not active service. I,62
NA,should like to know why service at Tel-el-,63
NA,Hobir is not regarded as war service. Th'.,63
NA,department has also declared that service,63
NA,in New Guinea is not regarded as active,63
NA,"service, notwithstanding the fact that an",63
NA,engagement was fought there and some,63
NA,men were killed. I f active service is con-,63
NA,sidered to be only that rendered in the,63
NA,"actual war zone, we shall know how tu",63

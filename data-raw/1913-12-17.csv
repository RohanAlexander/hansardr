NA,TEMPORA RY EMPLOYES .,12
Mr THOMAS ,"O n Tuesday, 2nd",12
NA,"December, on behalf of the Public Ser-",12
NA,"vice Commissioner, the Assistant M i n -",12
NA,ister of Home Affairs stated that tha,12
NA,Public Service A c t prevents temporary,12
NA,employe's from receiving higher pay than,12
NA,is given to permanent officials who are,12
NA,"doing the same work; and on Tuesday,",12
NA,"16th December, the Prime Minister, on",12
NA,behalf of the Public Service Commis-,12
NA,"sioner, made a statement to the effect",12
NA,that the rates paid to temporary employes,12
NA,"are governed by two factors, the ruling",12
NA,rate of pay fixed by a Wages Board or,12
NA,"other industrial authority being given,",12
NA,even though i t be higher than the rate,12
NA,of pay received by permanent officials,12
NA,doing the same work. These two,12
NA,"answers are seemingly contradictory, and",12
NA,I therefore ask the Prime Minister to,12
NA,call upon the Public Service Commis-,12
NA,"sioner to explain the position, and i f the",12
NA,"reply of the 2nd December is incorrect,",12
NA,to withdraw it?,12
NA,Mr JOSE PH COOK - I see no in-,12
NA,consistency. The reply given by my hon-,12
NA,orable colleague is quite correct. The law,12
NA,debar3 temporary employe's from receiv-,12
NA,ing more than is paid to permanent em-,12
NA,ployes who are doing the same' work.,12
NA,"The second reply was, in effect, that in",12
NA,"spite of the law, temporary employes are",12
NA,being paid the rates fixed by Wages,12
NA,Boards or other industrial authorities,12
NA,when these are higher than the rates paid,12
NA,to permanent employes.,12
Mr THOMAS ,D o I understand that,12
NA,if a trade unionist in the temporary,12
NA,employment of the Commonwealth ia paid',12
NA,"the trade union rate of wages, and that",12
NA,happens to be higher than the wages,12
NA,received by a permanent employ! doing,12
NA,"similar work, the law is being broken ?",12
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I ask the hon-,12
NA,orable member to read the section of the,12
NA,Act for himself.,12
NA,ELECTOR AL ENROLMENT.,12
Mr KING OMALLEY , I am i n -,12
NA,"formed that several persons at Stanley, in",12
NA,"the Darwin division, have been heavily",12
NA,"fined for failing to enrol, solicitors hav-",12
NA,ing been employed in the cases. I am,12
NA,"told, too, that those who have been fined",12
NA,are poor people. I ask the Assistant M i n-,12
NA,ister of Home Affairs i f i t would not be,12
NA,possible to issue the instruction that on,12
NA,the first charge the fine should be a small,12
NA,amount ?,12
Mr KELLY , I understand ..that the,12
NA,"first of cases of this kind, being test cases,",12
NA,necessarily involve the obtaining of legal,12
NA,"advice, but tbe fine need not be a large",12
NA,one. I t is the intention of the Depart-,12
NA,"ment, after the first cases have been dealt",12
NA,"with, to leave i t to the returning officers",12
NA,"to conduct their own business, and thus",12
NA,obviate legal expenditure.,12
NA,FITZROY DOCK.,13
Mr HOWE ,O n page 35 of the re-,13
NA,port of the Committee appointed to i n -,13
NA,quire into the partial suspension of some,13
NA,"operatives at the Fitzroy Dock, i t is",13
NA,stated by Captain Clarkson that he pre-,13
NA,vented tbe purchase of 200 lbs. of tungsten,13
NA,for certain purposes. Is the Minister,13
NA,prepared to lay on the table the corre-,13
NA,spondence between Captain Cutler and his,13
NA,officers i n connexion with the suspension,13
NA,of that order ?,13
Mr KELLY , - I shall submit the,13
NA,question to the Minister of Defence.,13
NA,PERSONAL EXPLANATION.,13
Mr FENTON , I n the Age of yester-,13
NA,day the following statement appears-,13
NA,Mr Fenton suggested that in order to popu-,13
NA,"larize the ios. bank note, thc Federal officers",13
NA,should be paid with them.,13
NA,"According to the Hansard report, this is",13
NA,what I said-,13
NA,I should like to ask why members of,13
NA,monwealth Service are not paid their salaries in,13
NA,Federal notes. It would be an admirable means,13
NA,of increasing tbe note circulation.,13
NA,The Age report attributes to me a foolish,13
NA,'suggestion. I do not know how the mis-,13
NA,take arose; i t may be due to sub-,13
NA,"editing, but these mistakes are much too",13
NA,frequent.,13
NA,SMALL - P OX OUTBREAK.,13
Mr GROOM ,Th e honorable member,13
NA,for Gwydir recently asked the following,13
NA,question-,13
NA,Is the Minister of Trade and Customs,13
NA,that recently a doctor and a nurse have,13
NA,alleged to be suffering from,13
NA,"quarantine area, although they are reported as",13
NA,"vaccinated ? In view of .this fact, and, there-",13
NA,"fore, of the futility of vaccination, will the posed-",13
NA,Minister now endeavour to remove the embargo,13
NA,on the people of Sydney?,13
NA,"I promised to have inquiries made, and",13
NA,to-day received the following report-,13
NA,One doctor and four nurse.s have been,13
NA,treatment at the Quarantine Station for small-,13
NA,pox since the beginning of the epidemic. These,13
NA,were all admitted on either the i6th or 17th,13
NA,"of July, and came from the Royal Prince",13
NA,"Alfred Hospital, in Sydney. Not any one of",13
NA,"these had been vaccinated in infancy, and",13
NA,any one of fhem had been vaccinated prior to,13
NA,the date of - infection; all were vaccinated,13
NA,"ing thc period of incubation, at a stage",13
NA,it was too late to prevent the development,13
NA,the disease. No evidence can be obtained of,13
NA,any medical man or nurse suffering from smallmatters.,13
NA,pox who was not treated at the station -,13
NA,[164],13
NA,BUSINESS OF THE SESSION.,13
Mr FISHER ,Thi s is a convenient,13
NA,occasion for the Prime Minister to make,13
NA,a statement regarding the business with,13
NA,which the session is to conclude. Private,13
NA,members have a good many notices on the,13
NA,paper. I wish to deal in some way with,13
NA,the Bills providing f or constitutional,13
NA,alterations. W i l l the Prime Minister,13
NA,say what business he intends to go on,13
NA,with ?,13
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Th e Leader of,13
NA,the Opposition is giving rather a large,13
NA,order at this period of the session. We,13
NA,wish to deal with the business on the,13
NA,"notice-paper, and that current between",13
NA,the two Houses. I am disappointed that,13
NA,the Senate went home last night.,13
Mr THOMAS ,Al l the Ministerial sup-,13
NA,porters except the three paid Ministers,13
NA,were away.,13
NA,Mr JOSE PH COOK -Wha t has that,13
NA,to do with the question? I t all depends,13
NA,upon how the business current between,13
NA,the Com- the two Chambers is disposed of. The,13
NA,honorable member would do better to,13
NA,address his question to the Senate.,13
Mr FISHER ,Wha t nonsense! I am,13
NA,"speaking of the business of this House,",13
NA,and not of the Senate.,13
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Th e business,13
NA,of this House is also the business of the,13
NA,Senate.,13
NA,DEFENCE LANDS PURCHASE,13
NA,BILL.,13
NA,Mr SPEAK ER reported the receipt of,13
NA,a message from His Excellency the Gover-,13
NA,aware nor-General recommending that an ap-,13
NA,been propriation be made for the purposes of,13
NA,small-pox in the this B i l l .,13
NA,Motio n (by Sir JOHN FOBBEST) pro-,13
NA,That the message be taken into consideration,13
NA,at a later hour this day.,13
Mr FISHER ,Wide Bay) [11.13] -,13
NA,I do not think the Prinie Minister should,13
NA,under refrain f r o m making a statement.,13
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I have made two,13
NA,"attempts, and you w i l l not let me do so.",13
Mr FISHER , T h a t is not correct. I,13
NA,did not intervene beyond giving the h o n -',13
NA,not orable member a lead. The Prime M i n -,13
NA,durister owes i t to the House not to be petu-,13
NA,when lant at a time like this. There are pro-,13
NA,of per ways of dealing with all these Supply,13
NA,W i l l the Prime Minister say,13
NA,what business he intends to go on with as,13
NA,"Government business, and when we may",14
NA,have private members' business brought,14
NA,on?,14
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Parramatta-,14
NA,Prime Minister and Minister of Home,14
NA,Affairs) [11.14] - I am disappointed at,14
NA,the progress made in another place. I,14
NA,thought we should be able to conclude the,14
NA,"business to-day, and get away without any",14
NA,"trouble, but owing to the delay there we",14
NA,are not able to do it. The business re-,14
NA,maining to be done here is the Oommittee,14
NA,"of Public Accounts Bill, the Old-age Pen-",14
NA,"sions Bill i f we can manage it, a Bill to",14
NA,rectify the trouble in the Public Service,14
NA,in connexion with the transfer of the,14
NA,"lighthouse officers, and another measure",14
NA,made necessary by the elimination of the,14
NA,"item of Â£300,000 from the Loan Bill for",14
NA,the purchase of land for defence purposes.,14
NA,That is the matter now before the Chair.,14
NA,"""We must have a further appropriation of",14
NA,revenue or hang the works up. I cannot,14
NA,say what we shall do about private mem-,14
NA,bers' business until I know what they are,14
NA,doing in another place.,14
Mr FISHER ,Canno t we go on with,14
NA,private members' business while waiting,14
NA,for the other?,14
NA,Mr JOSEPH COOK: -Immediatel y,14
NA,there is an opportunity I shall not be,14
NA,averse to going on with private business.,14
NA,Question resolved in the affirmative.,14
NA,PUBLIC DEBTS BILL .,14
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Swan-Trea -,14
NA,surer) [11.15] - I move-,14
NA,"That Order of the Day No. 7, Public Debts",14
NA,"B i l l , be discharged.",14
NA,I take this course because there is no time,14
NA,"to deal with the measure, and a difficulty",14
NA,which I did not anticipate has arisen in,14
NA,regard to the States. The States require,14
NA,to be consulted. I thought we had had,14
NA,"enough consultation, but I find that we",14
NA,have not. We propose to have a confer-,14
NA,ence as soon as we can with the State,14
NA,"Ministers, so as to leave them no reason",14
NA,to think that we desire to force this mat-,14
NA,ter upon the country without conferring,14
NA,again with them. A Bill has been pre-,14
NA,pared by myself and the Treasury,14
NA,"officials. Everything is ready, so far",14
NA,"as I am concerned, but in deference",14
NA,"the desire of the State Governments,",14
NA,in view also of the fact that there is,14
NA,time to deal with such an important mat-,14
NA,"ter this session, I am prepared to with-",14
NA,draw it.,14
Mr FISHER ,"Wide Bay) [11.17],-",14
NA,"Can .the right honorable gentleman say,",14
NA,"before the close of the session, what the",14
NA,proposals are which are to be discussed,14
NA,between the Government and the State,14
NA,Governments? That is a fair question,14
NA,to ask. I f the Commonwealth Govern-,14
NA,ment are going into a conference with,14
NA,the States on an important subject like,14
NA,"the State debts, the questions to be dis-",14
NA,"cussed should not be regarded as private,",14
NA,because this is not a party or political mat-,14
NA,ter. I f the Government have made up their,14
NA,minds as to the policy they intend to,14
NA,"pursue, they should be perfectly frank",14
NA,"with the country, and so should the",14
NA,"States, because there cannot be a satis-",14
NA,factory remedy of this anomaly unless,14
NA,the people are taken into the confidence,14
NA,of their leaders.,14
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Swan-,14
NA,Treasurer) [11.18] - I at first intended,14
NA,to introduce a measure and place on re-,14
NA,"cord the views of the Government, but",14
NA,when I found the States wished to have,14
NA,"a conference, I thought i t far better not",14
NA,to make a statement until the conference,14
NA,had taken place. I do n'ot think any-,14
NA,thing would be gained by doing i t .,14
NA,Perhaps a good deal of controversy would,14
NA,take place in the press and elsewhere on,14
NA,matters upon which we might be often in-,14
NA,clined to change our opinions. We are,14
NA,"not prepared, at present, to make a",14
NA,"statement, and will not be prepared to",14
NA,do so until after the conference.,14
NA,Question resolved in the affirmative.,14
NA,ATLANTIC CABLE.,14
Mr THOMAS ,^-Has the Postmaster-,14
NA,General taken any steps to bring before,14
NA,the Imperial authorities the desire of the,14
NA,present Government for the. nationaliza-,14
NA,tion of the Atlantic cable? The Prime,14
NA,Minister promised to do what he could,14
NA,in that way.,14
Mr AGAR WYNNE ,No .,14
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,I t is possible that,14
NA,the whole proposal may be modified by,14
NA,wireless arrangements.,14
NA,BEEF TRUST.,14
Mr SHARPE ,Ha s the Minister of,14
NA,to Trade and Customs seen an interview,14
NA,and which a newspaper in Queensland had,14
NA,no with Sir George Reid regarding the Beef,14
NA,"Trust now established i n Australia, and",15
NA,is i t the intention of the Government to,15
NA,take immediate action i n connexion with,15
NA,the trust? Different State Governments,15
NA,have prevented these people establishing,15
NA,themselves i n their respective States.,15
NA,Seeing that the Queensland Government,15
NA,"are not likely, however, to take any",15
NA,"action, and that the Commonwealth",15
NA,"Government have ,power to deal with",15
NA,"these people, I should like to know whe-",15
NA,ther i t is their intention to take,15
NA,immediate action to prevent the opera-,15
NA,tions of the trust i n Australia at the pre-,15
NA,sent time ?,15
Mr GROOM , I cannot say that I,15
NA,have seen the particular interview to,15
NA,"which the honorable member refers, but",15
NA,I read the opinion expressed by Sir,15
NA,George Reid i n an interview published,15
NA,i n this city. I have also had the privi -,15
NA,lege of a conference with the H i g h Com-,15
NA,missioner. The matter of the trust is,15
NA,"receiving very serious consideration, and",15
NA,the combined attention of the Department,15
NA,of Trade and Customs and the Depart-,15
NA,ment of the Attorney-General.,15
NA,B UREAU OP AGRICULTUREBILL . this Bill has been deferred pending,15
Mr HIGGS , I n view of the fact that,15
NA,a great deal of the work which i t is pro-,15
NA,posed shall be done by the Pederal Bureau,15
NA,of Agriculture is already being carried,15
NA,"out by the State Departments, does the",15
NA,Minister of Trade and Customs propose,15
NA,to move that the Bureau of Agriculture,15
NA,B i l l be discharged from the business-,15
NA,"paper, with a view to having the'whole",15
NA,question submitted to the conference of,15
NA,State Premiers whicli the Treasurer pro-,15
NA,poses to hold ?,15
Mr GROOM ,Th e honorable mem-,15
NA,ber's question is based upon inaccurate,15
NA,information. I t is not proposed that the,15
NA,Bureau of Agriculture shall duplicate,15
NA,work now oarried on by the State Depart-,15
NA,ments. The proposal is that i t shall,15
NA,undertake a large area of scientific re-,15
NA,search which at present the States cannot,15
NA,adequately take in hand.,15
NA,PANAMA EXPOSITION.,15
- Mr RILEY , H a s the Minister of,15
NA,External Affairs received an invitation,15
NA,from the United States Government with,15
NA,regard to the Parliament of the Com-,15
NA,monwealth being represented at the open-,15
NA,"ing of the Panama Canal, or at the",15
NA,"Panama Exposition, and, i f so, what ar-",15
NA,rangements does he propose to make ?,15
NA,[164]- 2,15
Mr GLYNN , I have not received,15
NA,any invitation for members of Parlia-,15
NA,"ment, but within the last few days I have",15
NA,had a renewal of the invitation extended,15
NA,to the Commonwealth to be represented,15
NA,at the Exposition.,15
Mr RILEY , W h a t form does the i n -,15
NA,vitation take ?,15
Mr GLYNN , T h e invitation is that,15
NA,the Commonwealth will take part in the,15
NA,"Exposition by sending exhibits, acting",15
NA,either alone or i n conjunction with the,15
NA,States. The matter is being considered.,15
NA,ELECTORAL BILL : ROYA L,15
NA,COMMISSION.,15
Mr TUDOR ,As one Order of the,15
NA,"Day has already been discharged, I wish",15
NA,to ask the Prime Minister whether he,15
NA,proposes to move that Order of the Day,15
NA,"No. 6, whicli relates to the further con-",15
NA,"sideration of the Electoral Bill, shall be",15
NA,discharged from the business-paper. The,15
NA,Prime Minister announced recently that,15
NA,it was intended to appoint a Royal Com-,15
NA,mission to inquire into the administra-,15
NA,"tion of the Electoral Act, and I under-",15
NA,stand that the further consideration of,15
NA,that,15
NA,inquiry. Has the Prime Minister any,15
NA,information to give to the House as to,15
NA,whether the Commission is to be ap-,15
NA,"pointed, and as to its personnel.",15
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I hope that we,15
NA,shall be able to appoint the Commission.,15
NA,"Meantime, I see no necessity for going",15
NA,through the formula of moving the dis-,15
NA,charge of the Orders of the Day which,15
NA,the Treasurer has thought f i t to adopt.,15
NA,I have no doubt that Orders of the Day,15
NA,will be discharged i n good time.,15

NA,"CONTBACTS FOR THE SUPPLY OP SLEEPERS,",15
NA,TRUCKS AND LOCOMOTIVES.,15
Mr MCWILLIAMS , I desire to ask,15
NA,the Minister of Home Affairs whether the,15
NA,Western Australian Government is carry-,15
NA,ing out its contract for the supply of,15
NA,sleepers to the Commonwealth?,15
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,I t is not. It,15
NA,"says, practically, that i t is unable to sup-",15
NA,ply the sleepers within the time allotted,15
NA,under the contract.,15
Mr RILEY , A r e the works being held,15
NA,up?,15
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Wha t have we,15
NA,to do with the works?,15
Mr RILEY , H a v e the works been,16
NA,layed ?,16
NA,Mr JOSE PH COOK -W e are buyers,16
NA,of sleepers from the Western' Australian,16
NA,"Government, and that Government is un-",16
NA,able to deliver these sleepers on time. I t,16
NA,does not appear that we are going to get,16
NA,them for some considerable time.,16
Mr KING OMALLEY , I s not the,16
NA,Minister of Home Affairs aware that tbe,16
NA,"delay is due, not to any fault on the part",16
NA,"of the Government of Western Australia,",16
NA,but to the heavy rains?,16
Mr SPEAKER ,Th e honorable mem-,16
NA,ber is not i u order i n asking a further,16
NA,question arising out of an answer given,16
NA,by a Minister to a previous question.,16
Mr MCWILLIAMS , I wish to put,16
NA,to the Minister of Home Affairs a further,16
NA,"question on the same subject, but not",16
NA,arising out of the question I have just,16
NA,"put. The question is, whether i t is a",16
NA,fact that the Western Australian Govern-,16
NA,ment had a period of thirteen months,16
NA,within wliich to supply sleepers be-,16
NA,fore,16
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! I am a f r a i d,16
NA,the honorable member's question is not,16
NA,in order.,16
Mr RILEY , W i l l the Minister of,16
NA,Home Affairs state whether i t is a fact,16
NA,that a contract was entered into with the,16
NA,Clyde Engineering Company for the,16
NA,manufacture and supply of a certain,16
NA,number of trucks with a view to facilitat-,16
NA,ing the construction of the transcon-,16
NA,tinental railway; that the trucks were,16
NA,not supplied within the time fixed by the,16
NA,"contract, and that an extension of that",16
NA,contract has been allowed ?,16
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I should think,16
NA,that tliat is a reason for trying to insist,16
NA,"upon the proper observance of contracts,",16
NA,and not an excuse for any delay.,16
Mr KING OMALLEY , I wish to,16
NA,"ask the Prime Minister whether, i n con-",16
NA,sidering the question of cancelling the,16
NA,contract for the supply of sleepers which,16
NA,the Western Australian Government,16
NA,"entered into with the Commonwealth, he",16
NA,will have regard to the fact that the,16
NA,whole of the transcontinental railway is,16
NA,depending upon the railways of Western,16
NA,"Australia; and, further, whether i t",16
NA,would not be wise for him to consider the,16
NA,question of transportation before he takes,16
NA,such action ?,16
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Th e honorable,16
NA,member may rely upon the Government,16
NA,degiving the Goverment of Western Aus-,16
NA,tralia justice i n regard to this matter.,16
NA,We shall not act unreasonably.,16
Mr TUDOR , I desire to ask the,16
NA,Assistant Minister of Home Affairs,16
NA,whether the tenders for the construction,16
NA,of locomotives for the transcontinental,16
NA,"railway, which closed about three weeks,",16
NA,"ago, have yet been dealt with, and",16
NA,whether any Australian firm is likely to,16
NA,obtain any of the work?,16
Mr KELLY , I very much regret to,16
NA,say that no Australian firm tendered in,16
NA,the second competition. I hope to invite,16
NA,"tenders shortly for further supplies,",16
NA,which may induce Australian tenderers,16
NA,to come forward.,16
NA,THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE,16

NA,Minister's statement that he cannot,16
NA,understand the action taken by the Trea-,16
NA,surer i n moving that certain Bills be dis-,16

NA,to ask the right honorable gentleman,16
NA,what he thinks of the statement made by,16
NA,the honorable member for Gippsland that,16
NA,the Prime Minister is the only Minister,16
NA,willing and able to fight the Labour,16
NA,party ?,16
Mr SPEAKER ,Orde r ! I would re-,16
NA,mind the honorable member that i t is not,16

Mr AGAR WYNNE , I think that,16

NA,ACCOUNTS BILL (No. 2).,17
NA,BILL. I n Committee (Consideration resumed,17
NA,"from 16th December, vide page 4507).",17
NA,Clause 1 (Short title).,17
NA,Mr W . H . IRVINE (Flinders-,17
NA,Attorney-General) [11.36] - I explained,17
NA,in outline last evening the necessity for,17
NA,bringing i n a B i l l i f we desired to accede,17
NA,generally to the desire of the Senate t q,17
NA,have a Joint Standing Committee. I,17
NA,"should like to add -to what I then said,",17
NA,COOK) pro-,17
NA,that this B i l l differs from the B i l l that,17
NA,"was withdrawn, not merely i n regard to",17
NA,"the constitution of the Committee, and",17
NA,in authorizing a new Joint Committee t o .,17
NA,"be formed, but i n expressly providing the",17
NA,main functions of the Committee. Clause,17
NA,3 is as follows-,17
NA,includes The duties of the Committee shall be-,17
NA,(a) to examine the accounts of the receipts,17
NA,the and expenditure of the Common-,17
NA,"wealth, and to bring under the notice",17
NA,of both Houses of the Parliament,17
NA,any items in those accounts or any,17
NA,circumstance connected with them to,17
NA,The which they think that attention should,17
NA,be directed;,17
NA,(i) to report to both Houses of the Parlia-,17
NA,ment any alteration which the Com-,17
NA,mittee think desirable in the form of,17
NA,the public accounts oi the method of,18
NA,"keeping them, or in the mode of re-",18
NA,ceipt control issue or payment of the,18
NA,public money.,18
NA,"In passing, I may say that this last -duty",18
NA,will include the power of making sug-,18
NA,gestions in regard to practically every-,18
NA,thing that comes under the Auditor-,18
NA,General's Department.,18
Mr FENTON ,Contracts ?,18
Mr WH IRVINE ,Thi s is a,18
NA,purely investigatory and informative,18
NA,"Committee, but the scope of the subjects",18
NA,i t may investigate and report on includes,18
NA,"the whole frame of the Estimates, for",18
NA,"instance, 'and any matter that arises out",18
NA,"of the Estimates, and the whole machinery",18
NA,"pf, and any matter that arises under, the",18
NA,"Audit Act, whether belonging to the",18
NA,"Audit Act or not, as to the "" mode of",18
NA,"receipt, control, issue, or payment of the",18
NA,"public money."" The clause proceeds-",18
NA,(c) to inquire into and report upon any,18
NA,questions in connexion with the pub-,18
NA,!,18
NA,lie .accounts which are referred to,18
NA,them by either House of the Parlia-,18
NA,ment ;,18
NA,(d) any other duties assigned to the Com-,18
NA,mittee by ' joint standing orders,18
NA,proved by both Houses of the Parlia-,18
NA,ment.,18
NA,When the previous Bill was before the,18
NA,"House, I pointed out, in the course of",18
NA,"the discussion, in answer to a criticism",18
NA,that was addressed to the fact that i t did,18
NA,npt contain any indication of the duties,18
NA,"of the Committee, that i t was not a Bill",18
NA,enabling a Committee to be appointed,18
NA,"and to fix the duties, but a Bill merely",18
NA,empowering the Committee when ap-,18
NA,"pointed, and when its duties had been",18
NA,"Allocated, to sit and call evidence. The",18
NA,"Etill before us, however, is an enabling",18
NA,Bill for the creation of a new Standing,18
NA,"Committee, and, therefore, i t is appro-",18
NA,priate that i t should set out the main,18
NA,"jSuties of the Committee, leaving i t , if",18
NA,"necessary, to the Houses, by Joint Stand-",18
NA,"ing Orders, to enlarge the duties if they",18
NA,"$hink fit, and to refer to the Committee",18
NA,?>ny matters regarding which they desire,18
NA,investigation and report. This is not,18
NA,"like a Public Works Committee, which",18
NA,"has a direct control, and without whose",18
NA,report certain works cannot be carried out.,18
NA,A Public Works Committee has an actively,18
NA,"restrictive function, whereas we now",18
NA,propose a purely informative Committee.,18
NA,The powers embodied in clause 3 are,18
NA,taken almost verbatim from the Standing,18
NA,Orders of the Victorian Legislative As-,18
NA,sembly of 1895. Those Standing Orders,18
NA,"include one or two things, such as in-",18
NA,quiry into the investments of Savings,18
NA,"Bank Commissioners, that are not em-",18
NA,"braced in our provision, but which may",18
NA,be referred to the Committee by either,18
NA,"House, or by a joint resolution of both",18
NA,Houses if thought necessary. The Vic-,18
NA,torian Committeehas been in existence,18
NA,"for a large number of years, and as it",18
NA,has done very excellent work under,18
NA,"these Standing Orders, i t is thought der",18
NA,sirable to start our Joint Standing Com-,18
NA,mittee on Public Accounts with the main,18
NA,powers fhat were granted to the Vic-,18
NA,torian Standing-Committee.,18
Mr FISHER ,Wide Bay) [11.42] -,18
NA,"The Bill, as I read i t , is intended to pro-",18
NA,vide statutory powers for a -Committee,18
NA,that might reasonably have been ap-,18
NA,pointed under our own Standing Orders.,18
NA,I direct the attention .of the Attorney-,18
NA,"Genera} ,to .the use of the words ' ' bring",18
NA,under the notice of both Houses of Par-,18
NA,"liament "" in .clause 3, whereas elsewhere",18
NA,"the words employed are "" shall report tp",18
NA,"Parliament."" I think the words "" bring",18
NA,under the notice of both Houses'' are ton,18
NA,ap- loose a phrase to be incorporated in a Bill,18
NA,that deals with finance. I should think,18
NA,that these words would permit any mem-,18
NA,"ber of the Committee, without the autho-",18
NA,"rity of the Qommitt.ee, to bring certain",18
NA,things under the notice of Parliament.,18
NA,Mr ^V. H . IBVINE -On e member of,18
NA,the Committee may be asked to inform,18
NA,Parliament. The provision was made as,18
NA,wide as possible for that reason.,18
NA,"Mr FISHER . ^ I am opposed to that,",18
NA,especially in regard to financial matters.,18
NA,There should be no loose method of mak-,18
NA,"ing any statement to Parliament, because",18
NA,"that would be the beginning of trouble,",18
NA,and possibly lead to the dissemination of,18
NA,misleading statements. I t is better to,18
NA,"bind the Committee to a report, either a",18
NA,majority report or a unanimous one. No,18
NA,statement should come down' from indi-,18
NA,viduals of the Committee through our em-,18
NA,"ploying the words ""bring under the",18
NA,"notice of Parliament."" Again, i t is not",18
NA,advisable to use varying terms in the one,18
NA,"measure, because the Committee might",18
NA,"reasonably say, '' A l l we are asked to do",18
NA,in this matter is to bring i t under the,18
NA,"'notice of Parliament, and our work is",18
NA,"done."" The Committee are likely to do",18
NA,a great deal of-good. Instead of our,18
NA,having suspicious statements that are,18
NA,"made sometimes inadvertently, and some-",18
NA,"times not, the Committee will be in a",18
NA,position to bring before Parliament the,19
NA,actual condition of our financial,19
NA,I wish to heaven everything could be,19
NA,"laid on the table, so that the people could it stronger.",19
NA,know exactly what had been ordered and,19
NA,what had been paid for. Governments,19
NA,"make blunders, but they are more likely",19
NA,to succeed when every matter is put,19
NA,fore Parliament aud the people.,19
NA,democratic country like tliis no one,19
NA,likely to attempt to cover up any matter;,19
NA,he would be the first to suffer. I think,19
NA,we should make this Committee report on,19
NA,everything that i s ' worth reporting on.,19
NA,The provision that Parliament may refer,19
NA,matters to the Committee for report,19
NA,good proposal. I f any honorable,19
NA,ber desires that a certain thing shall be,19
NA,"investigated, he can invite Parliament",19
NA,to pass a motion submitting the,19
NA,to the Committee ; and I suggest to hon-,19
NA,orable members that they should exercise,19
NA,that right very freely when they think,19
NA,"that the public interests are involved, i n",19
NA,order that the facts may be brought out,19
NA,i n an official way for the information,19
NA,Parliament and the public. The,19
NA,ber of members proposed is a workable our Under-Treasurers.,19
NA,one. I do not think another place will,19
NA,make any complaint as to the division-,19
NA,five for this House and two for the the Committee.,19
NA,Senate. Though another place has cerments,19
NA,"tain rights, undoubtedly the House of",19
NA,Representatives is more concerned i n,19
NA,"financial matters, so that a fair division",19
NA,has been proposed. I see no reason,19
NA,the B i l l should not be accepted.,19
NA,different matter from appointing a,19
NA,Committee of the House. We cannot,19
NA,elect this Committee until the B i l l be-,19
NA,comes law. I agree with the Attorney-,19
NA,General that a Committee of Public Ac-,19
NA,"counts - should be appointed by Statute, .",19
NA,and given statutory authority for every-,19
NA,thing they do. They will then be more,19
NA,answerable for their conduct than a Com-,19

Mr FENTON ,Maribyrnong) [11.49].,19
NA,- I welcome this measure as I welcomed,19
NA,the measure for the appointment of a,19
NA,Public Works Committee. There is a,19
NA,"growing feeling i n the community that, as",19
NA,"a rule, the Government of a country are",19
NA,"too much the tail that wags the dog, and",19
NA,I think these investigating Committees,19

NA,who showed clearly that since the in,20

NA,NA,20

Mr FOSTER ,Le t us have facts up to,20
NA,date-no t ten years old.,20
Mr FISHER , I am giving facts up,20
NA,"to date, extending over a period of ten",20
NA,years of railway work. I t was proved,20
NA,"that 12 per cent, actual saving was made,",20
NA,NA,20
NA,only did the day-labour system save,20
NA,"money, but that their permanent-way was",20
NA,better than it would have been i f the work,20
NA,had been done by contract. I appeal to,20
NA,honorable members not to act on pre-,20
NA,"judice in this matter, because day labour",20
NA,properly organized in the Northern Ter-,20
NA,ritory will undoubtedly be less expensive,20
NA,than contract. I n a country so far dis-,20
NA,"tant, the contractors will, undoubtedly, for",20
NA,the slightest deviation or change in con-,20
NA,"struction, bleed the Commonwealth.",20
Mr RICHARD FOSTER ,Wake-,20
NA,field) [12.3] -Th e Leader of the Opposi-,20
NA,tion has not told us how long it is since,20
NA,Queensland abandoned the contract,20
NA,system.,20
Mr FISHER ,Sh e tried i t f or thirty,21
NA,years.,21
Mr RICHARD FOSTER , I t is ten,21
NA,"years, I understand, since they abandoned",21
NA,i t ; that makes all the difference. I t is,21
NA,quite true that in the old days of the con-,21
NA,tract system we were not moving on econo-,21
NA,"mical lines, and that when that system was",21
NA,superseded by day labour there was a,21
NA,"considerable saving f o r some time, but",21
NA,there is as much difference between the,21
NA,contract system to-day and ten or fifteen,21
NA,years ago as there is between darkness,21
NA,and light. The Leader of the Opposi-,21
NA,"tion's illustration is no proof, because",21
NA,"there is, and can be, no test unless the",21
NA,principle adopted by South Australia is,21
NA,"brought into force-tha t is, to submit",21
NA,"public works to public tender, and allow",21
NA,the Department to tender.,21
NA,partment's tender is lowest then the De-,21
NA,partment does its own work. I n the case,21
NA,cited by the Leader of the Opposition we,21
NA,simply have an estimate of the responsible,21
NA,officer of the Department. I know that,21
NA,"is so, because the system of having the",21
NA,estimate of fhe responsible officer was,21
NA,tried i n the case of many public works,21
NA,"i u South Australia and other States, and",21
NA,you cannot be sure that the estimate,21
NA,"is a correct one, because there is no check",21
NA,on i t . There are industrial conditions i n,21
NA,these days that were never dreamt of i n,21
NA,previous days.,21
Mr TUDOR ,I s that why there was a,21
NA,deputation of the printers in South Aus-,21
NA,tralia to ask the Government to add to,21
NA,the price of the Government Printing,21
NA,Office 15 per cent.?,21
Mr RICHARD FOSTER ,I f,21
NA,"were so, i t must have been an awful price,",21
NA,because the Printing Office i n South Aus-,21
NA,"tralia, like those i n most of the other",21
NA,"States, is, and always has been, simply a",21
NA,sink into which public money is poured.,21
Mr ARCHIBALD ,Wh y do,21
NA,here slandering your own State?,21
Mr RICHARD FOSTER , I am,21
NA,simply speaking the t r u t h i n the i n -,21
NA,terests of the taxpayers.,21
NA,bound by irresponsible people outside,21
NA,to advocate a certain policy on the,21
NA,"floor of the House, whether i t is a",21
NA,policy of economy or of reckless expendi-,21
NA,ture. I n the case cited by the Leader of,21
NA,"the Opposition, we have simply the esti-",21
NA,"mate of the public official, who has to",21
NA,provide a margin to cover contingencies.,21
NA,T would remind the honorable member for,21
NA,"Hindmarsh of a case in our own State,",21
NA,"when Mr Verran, as Leader of a",21
NA,"Labour Government,"" was adopting the",21
NA,day-labour principle. He made the state-,21
NA,"ment to the men, and to the public, that",21
NA,the men made it almost impossible for,21
NA,"him to carry out the work, and he had to",21
NA,send for a contractor and give him prac-,21
NA,tically his own price. To-day we have,21
NA,the east to west railway as an example.,21
NA,The honorable member for Herbert only,21
NA,the other day made a scathing and abso-,21
NA,"lutely correct statement in this House,",21
NA,which I defy anybody to answer. His,21
NA,"allegations must be investigated, arid will,",21
NA,"I am certain, be found, if anything, to be",21
NA,understated. The workmen under the,21
NA,South Australian Government in the,21
NA,Northern service know that what the,21
NA,I f the De- honorable member said about the conduct,21
NA,of the work on the east to west railway,21
NA,is absolutely accurate. The honorable,21
NA,member's complaint is in Hansard.,21
Mr RILEY , W h y do you not make,21
NA,your Government investigate it?,21
Mr RICHARD FOSTER , I shall be,21
NA,ashamed of the Government i f they do,21
NA,not do so rightup to the hilt. I f they,21
NA,do not go into the charges at the earliest,21
NA,"opportunity i n the recess, they w i l l have",21
NA,"no quarter from me, and I shall tell the",21
NA,taxpayers of this country whab I know,21
NA,to be correct. Let honorable members,21
NA,"opposite, i n the interests of the taxpayers,",21
NA,put their principles to the simple test of,21
NA,"the tender, and if the Government, witli",21
NA,"all its advantages, cannot compete with",21
NA,"the contractor, we have no business to",21
NA,take a course which is not i n the best i n -,21
NA,terest of the taxpayers.,21
Mr RILEY , W e say they save money.,21
Mr RICHARD FOSTER ,Th e job,21

Mr FINLAYSON ,Brisbane) [12.12].,21
NA,"-Wheneve r this question is mentioned,",21
NA,ib is amusing to notice that certain hon-,21
NA,I am not orable members on the other side become,21
NA,"excited, and angry, and explosive. The",21
NA,honorable member for Wakefield has,21
NA,given us an exhibition of anger at the,21
NA,mere suggestion of the superiority of day-,21
NA,labour. He accused us of being subject,21
NA,to the dictation of some irresponsible,21
NA,"people outside, but that statemeut is",21
NA,quite i n keeping with his other irrespon-,21
NA,sible and untrue assertions. We have,21
NA,taken up a definite line of policy i n this,22
NA,"matter. I t is not a matter of estimate,",22
NA,but a matter of fact. I f the honorable,22
NA,member for Wakefield had read Mr .,22
NA,Paget's statement as to the conduct of,22
NA,construction work by day labour i n,22
NA,"Queensland, he would know that i t was",22
NA,based on an estimate taken by way of,22
NA,contrast with contract work.,22
NA,"that there was a saving of Â£1,000 per",22
NA,mile to the Government i n building rail-,22
NA,ways by day labour.,22
Mr RICHARD FOSTER ,Th e,22
NA,of the Opposition said i t was ten years,22
NA,since the Queensland Government had a,22
NA,contract.,22
Mr FINLAYSON , T h i s is an ad-,22
NA,ditional argument against the honorable,22
NA,member. I t was stated a minute ago,22
NA,"that, the additional cost was due to the",22
NA,increase i n the cost of labour and ma-,22
NA,terials during the last few years. That,22
NA,disadvantage would be against the day-,22
NA,labour system rather than the contract,22
NA,system.,22
Mr RICHARD FOSTER ,Th e union agi-,22
NA,tators made all the difference.,22
Mr RODGERS ,Le t us have a vote;,22
NA,our minds are made up.,22
Mr FINLAYSON , T h e honorable,22
NA,member for Wannon is to be commended,22
NA,for his admission that honorable members,22
NA,opposite have made up their minds.,22
Mr RODGERS ,An d so have the Op-,22
NA,position.,22
Mr FINLAYSON , '* Ephraim is,22
NA,"joined to idols; let him alone."" That the",22
NA,day-labour system is cheaper than the con-,22
NA,"tract system is a matter,' not of opinion",22
NA,"but of fact, and some of the strongest",22
NA,facts i n support of i t have come from,22
NA,members of the Liberal party.,22
NA,Brisbane Courier of 3rd instant there,22
NA,"appears a report"" of a deputation of",22
NA,master builders who waited on the State,22
NA,"Minister of Public Works, Mr W . H .",22
NA,Barnes. I shall not weary the Committee,22
NA,by reading the statements made by the,22
NA,"contractors, honorable members may read",22
NA,them for themselves; b u t may I read the,22
NA,reply made by the Minister?,22
NA,master builders requested that certain,22
NA,public works should be carried out by con-,22
NA,"tract, and made statements damaging i n",22
NA,their criticism of the day-labour system.,22
NA,They referred to the reported Josses under,22
NA,"the system i n other States, to the poor",22
NA,"quality of the work, the slowness of i t",22
NA,"and so forth . The Minister, who, i",22
NA,"should be remembered, is a member",22
NA,"a Conservative Government, and is op-",22
NA,"posed to the Labour party, said",22
Mr RICHARD FOSTER , I do not care,22
NA,two straws for that.,22
Mr FINLAYSON , I am sorry that,22
NA,the honorable member is not open t o,22
NA,argument.,22
Mr RICHARD FOSTER ,I t makes no,22
NA,I t showed difference to me whether a man is a Con-,22
NA,servative or a member of the Labour,22
NA,party.,22
Mr FINLAYSON , I f the honorable,22
NA,"Leader member will accept the facts, then my pur-",22
NA,pose will have been served. Tins was the,22
NA,reply made by the Queensland Minister,22
NA,of Public Works to the deputation-,22
NA,In the past the officers had been careful to,22
NA,"make their estimates, and i f the lowest tenders",22
NA,were higher the work was taken up by the De-,22
NA,partment. Often fresh tenders were invited.,22
NA,"Personally, his inclination was in favour o f",22
NA,tender. But he was face to face with the fact,22
NA,that the officers' estimate of day labour was,22
NA,sometimes much below the contract prices. There,22
NA,"was no other course, therefore, in the public",22
NA,"interests, but to go on with the work. He had",22
NA,no right to let his own desires weigh in that,22
NA,"regard, when public duty stood in the road.",22
NA,"So f a r as the Department was concerned, the.",22
NA,great bulk of the work was carried out by pub-,22
NA,lic tender. He was quite free to admit that,22
NA,very often the lowest tender was less than the,22
NA,official estimate. They had reminded him o f,22
NA,the high' cost in New South Wales of some o f,22
NA,the works recently carried out in that State.,22
NA,But there were no such figures available in con-,22
NA,nexion with his Department. So far as he knew,22
NA,there was no such thing in existence as the,22
NA,""" Government stroke."" He quoted a few cases",22
NA,to support his view. On the new refreshment,22
NA,"rooms in the gardens, though the work had been",22
NA,"increased on the original plan by Â£200, they",22
NA,had still saved Â£270. I n a Lands' Department:,22
NA,"job the lowest tender was Â£484, but they carried",22
NA,out the work for Â£286. I n the Geological!,22
NA,"branch they saved Â£234 on a job, as compared",22
NA,to the lowest tender. I t had been said that in-,22
NA,"I n the these works no charge was made f o r the work,",22
NA,"of the officers engaged, but that was not so..",22
NA,Everything was properly apportioned. Some--,22
NA,"thin"" had also been said about work at Goodna,.",22
NA,"which was being carried out by day labour,",22
NA,"but they would save something like Â£9,000 on-",22
NA,the job. I f they thought the specifications were-,22
NA,not adhered to he would be glad to drive a-,22
NA,party of them out to inspect i t . I t was only,22
NA,fai r to the officers to say that many thousands-,22
NA,of pounds had been saved by the system at,22
NA,present in force. One. big work had been men-,22
NA,"These tioned, which he would refer to. That was the-",22
NA,Rockhampton Technical College. The estimate-,22
NA,"was Â£12,733, a n d",22
NA,"lowest tender Â£15,703, and",22
NA,"it was expected that f u l l y Â£3,000 would be-",22
NA,saved on those figures. At Goodna the estimate,22
NA,"for one ward was Â£16,621, and the lowest ten-",22
NA,"der Â£20,790, and they expected to considerably",22
NA,cut under the estimate.,22
NA,", I f that is not an absolute answer to every",22
NA,t statement made by the honorable member-,22
NA,of for Wakefield I do not know what is.,22
Mr RICHARD FOSTER , A l l tha t we ask,23
NA,is that tihe work shall be submitted to,23
NA,"public tender, and i f the Department's",23
NA,"tender is the lowest, i t should be allowed",23
NA,to undertake the work.,23
NA,Mr FINLAYSON' -Th e honorable,23
NA,member's interjection reminds me of an,23
NA,erroneous statement which he made when,23
NA,NA,23
NA,"-statement,' had' only the Estimates of the",23
NA,Department before him.,23
NA,"only the Estimates,'but actual figures and",23
NA,facts i u connexion with the construction,23
NA,of railways. He had previous knowledge,23
NA,"of work conducted by the Department,",23
NA,as well as the tenders submitted.,23
Mr RICHARD FOSTER , I did not,23
NA,that he had tenders.,23
NA,made a mistake. I had i n,23
NA,statement of the Leader of the Opposition contractors.,23
NA,that no tenders had been received for,23
NA,railway construction i n Queensland,23
NA,about ten years.,23
Mr FINLAYSON , I am glad that,23
NA,the honorable member admits that he ment,23
NA,made a mistake. The Queensland,23
NA,vernment' had never abandoned tlie concontractor.,23
NA,tract system i n the building of railways.,23
NA,But experience of a very serious and the country to be traversed.,23
NA,-damaging character has induced them not everything ready to start at once.,23
NA,only to establish the principle of,23
NA,labour i n the construction of railway',23
NA,"work, but to apply i t also to other public",23
NA,"works. The Minister of Public Works,",23
NA,"as I ' have just read, has been' compelled",23
NA,' to adopt the' system against his own i,23
NA,"clinations, the facts being against",23
NA,"opinion, and i f the honorable member for",23
NA,Wakefield and His party Were open tb conplant.,23

NA,are those submitted by outside con-,23
NA,tractors.,23
Mr RICHARD FOSTER ,Th e Leader of,23
NA,the Opposition told us that Queensland,23

Mr FINLAYSON , I have just read,23

NA,:,23
NA,I t ' is,23

NA,Th'e CHAIRMAN - There is a ten-,23
NA,1,23
NA,State dency on this amendment to discuss the,23
NA,whole question' of day labour. I must,23
NA,ask honorable members to confine their,24
NA,attention to the question of the construc-,24
NA,tion of this line.,24
Mr HANS IRVINE ,Grampians),24
NA,[12.26] -I n reply to the honorable mem-,24
NA,"ber for Brisbane, I should like to say",24
NA,- thafc I read last night a statement i n a,24
NA,newspaper to the effect that i n Western,24
NA,Australia the Wilson Government con-,24
NA,structed a railway under the contract,24
NA,"system at a cost of Â£1,400 per mile,",24
NA,"whereas i t cost the Scaddan Government,",24
NA,"under the day-labour system, Â£2,000 per",24
NA,mile to build a line running through the,24
NA,same class of country. The difference is,24
NA,due to the fact that under the day-labour,24
NA,system we do not get the best results,24
NA,from the workers. I n nine cases out of,24
NA,ten i t is based on the principle that there,24
NA,"should be no work between meals, and",24
NA,that is what honorable members opposite,24
NA,want. The day-labour system is a bad,24
NA,one to adopt. Let tenders be invited,24
NA,for this work. Give the Department an,24
NA,"opportunity to -tender, and i f i n open",24
NA,"competition i t can secure the contract, let",24
NA,i t carry out the work. Under the rSgime,24
NA,of a Socialistic Labour Government in,24
NA,Western Australia we have had an illus-,24
NA,tration of the costliness of the day-labour,24
NA,system as applied to railway construc-,24
NA,"tion, and We have also had an illustration",24
NA,of its costliness i n New South Wales,24
NA,during the last three years.,24
Mr WEST , W h a t has happened i n,24
NA,New South Wales?,24
Mr HANS IRVINE , T h e people,24
NA,have declared themselves to be i n favour,24
NA,of the bribery and corruption which your,24
NA,party are supporting. The State Labour,24
NA,Government when i t took office inherited,24
NA,"a surplus of over Â£2,000,000.",24
NA,the largest revenue that had ever been,24
NA,raised i n the State,24
The CHAIRMAN , O r d e r !,24
Mr HANS IRVINE , I t borrowed,24
NA,"nearly Â£20,000,000",24
Mr CHARLTON , I rise to a point of,24
NA,order.,24
Mr HANS IRVINE , A n d closed its,24
NA,three years of office with a deficit of over,24
NA,"Â£2,000,000.",24
The CHAIRMAN , T h e honorable,24
NA,member is quite out of order i n referring,24
NA,to that matter.,24
Mr HANS IRVINE , I admit that I,24
NA,"am, sir; but I have simply told the t r u t h .",24
NA,The figures I have quoted show unmis-,24
NA,takably the added cost of day labour as,24
NA,compared with contract work.,24
Mr ARCHIBALD ,Hindmarsh),24
NA,[12.30] -I t is a matter of regret that the,24
NA,present Government show hostility to the,24
NA,"day-labour system - I n my opinion, i t",24
NA,is always better that the Government,24
NA,should have freedom of action.,24
Mr GLYNN , T h a t is all we desire.,24
Mr ARCHIBALD , O n the other,24
NA,"hand, I am inclined to think that the Go-",24
NA,"vernment are, to a certain extent, pledged",24
NA,"to the contract system. I t is, as I say, a",24
NA,great mistake to bind the Government,24
NA,"down i n this regard, because there may be",24
NA,times when i t is desirable to have work,24
NA,"done by contract, and other times when",24
NA,day labour may. be preferred. I am,24
NA,rather surprised at the tirade of the hon-,24
NA,"orable member f o r Wakefield, and at the",24
NA,prejudice he has displayed i n relation to,24
NA,day labour. N o one knows better than,24
NA,that honorable member that great savings,24
NA,have been made i n South Australia i n,24
NA,consequence of the Government undertak-,24
NA,ing the construction of their own rail-,24
NA,ways.,24
Mr RICHARD FOSTER ,"Yes , fifteen",24
NA,"years ago; but I can show a 60 per cent,",24
NA,added cost on the other side.,24
Mr ARCHIBALD , T h e honorable,24
NA,member will not deny that the contrac-,24
NA,tors f o r the overland railway f r o m Ade-,24
NA,laide to Melbourne made a remarkably,24
NA,""" good thing "" of i t .",24
NA,"Mr RICHAR D "" FOSTER - I am talking",24
NA,"of to-day, and not of twenty-five years",24
NA,ago.,24
Mr ARCHIBALD , T h e honorable,24
NA,member was i n ofiice when the contract,24
NA,system was superseded by the day-labour,24
NA,"I t had system; and, truly, the evolution of poli-",24
NA,ticians i n Australia is marvellous! I,24
NA,know men who at one time were strongly,24
NA,"i n favour of day labour, and who can now",24
NA,scarcely find language vivid enough to,24
NA,denounce i t . This ought not to be a mat-,24
NA,ter of politics-i t is simply a matter of',24
NA,fact.,24
Mr RICHARD FOSTER , I t is a matter-,24
NA,of the taxpayers' money!,24
Mr ARCHIBALD , W e are trustees-,24
NA,"for the taxpayers, and i t is our duty to see-",24
NA,that public works are carried out by the,24
NA,"cheapest and most efficient method, i r r e -",24
NA,spective of party. We know that railway-,24
NA,construction has been undertaken by the,24
NA,"various State Governments, and that the-",24
NA,work has proved cheaper than under con-,24
NA,tract.,24
Mr RICHARD FOSTER ,"Yes , ten or f i f -",25
NA,teen years ago!,25
Mr ARCHIBALD , W e have the evi-,25
NA,dence of a Conservative Minister i n,25
NA,"Queensland, who said that, i n regard to",25
NA,"day labour, he had heen "" reluctantly",25
NA,"compelled "" to alter his opinion. I re-",25
NA,gret the remarks of the honorable mem-,25
NA,"ber i n regard to South Australia, because",25
NA,we have not the figures here to enable us,25
NA,to judge.,25
Mr RICHARD FOSTER , I have,25
NA,figures here-th e tenders.,25
Mr ARCHIBALD , N o doubt the,25
NA,honorable inember has the figures f o r one,25
NA,"side, and, unfortunately, my experience",25
NA,of recent years is that there is always,25
NA,another side to any remarks he may make.,25
NA,"The Queensland evidence, to which I",25
NA,"have referred, is of to-day, and not years",25
NA,ago; and I think that our distinguished,25
NA,and learned friend the Attorney-General,25
NA,could tell us something about the price,25
NA,of locomotives i n Victoria under the con-,25
NA,"tract system. Of course, I do not deny",25
NA,that day labour under a weak Govern-,25
NA,"ment, with poor organization, may prove",25
NA,"expensive; b u t i n Queensland, and, as",25
NA,"matters wore i n South Australia, for i n -",25
NA,"stance, there is every guarantee that the",25
NA,taxpayers' interest is conserved. The as-,25
NA,"sumption of the late Government, i n in-",25
NA,"stituting day labour, was that the work",25
NA,would be properly organized. Another,25
NA,example of a saving under day labour is,25
NA,presented i n the Commonwealth Offices i n,25
NA,London.,25
Mr RICHARD FOSTER ,W e cannot find,25
NA,out what the cost has been.,25
Mr ARCHIBALD , I do not think,25
NA,there would he any difficulty i n finding,25
NA,out; and I have no hesitation i n saying,25
NA,"that, when the accounts are produced, we",25
NA,shall find a similar result to that obtained,25
NA,in Queensland. I regret that the honor-,25
NA,able member f o r Wakefield should have,25
NA,raked up the matter of the Government,25
NA,Printing Office i n Adelaide.,25
Mr RICHARD FOSTER , I,25
NA,""" rake "" i t up.",25
Mr ARCHIBALD ,Suc h,25
NA,"miÂ«ht very well be made i n Adelaide,",25
NA,where the necessary information to con-,25
NA,"firm it, or otherwise, is available. A t",25
NA,"any rate, we have the fact that the",25
NA,"master printers i n Adelaide, i n applying",25
NA,"to the Government for work, desired that",25
NA,the tenders of the Government Printing,25
NA,Office should be loaded to the extent of,25
NA,10 per cent.; and this cloes not look,25
NA,very much as ifthat establishment,25
NA,were a sink for public money. I f the,25
NA,printing work for this Parliament were,25
NA,"done by a private firm, the extras i n -",25
NA,volved i n the fact that the office would,25
NA,have to be practically kept going day,25
NA,"and night, would be staggering.",25
The CHAIRMAN , T h e honorable,25
NA,member must not discuss that matter.,25
NA,t-Re,25
Mr ARCHIBALD , T h e honorable,25
NA,"member for Wakefield wandered a b i t ,",25
NA,and I thought I would keep hi m com-,25
NA,pany. I f freedom of action were left,25
NA,"to the Government, as I think i t ought",25
NA,"to be, I feel pretty confident as to the",25
NA,course that would be pursued by the,25
NA,Minister i n charge of this B i l l ; b u t,25
NA,"members of the Government, and their",25
NA,"supporters, have gone throughout the",25
NA,country declaring that they are i n favour,25
NA,"of the, contract system, and this, of",25
NA,"course, makes honorable members on this",25
NA,side somewhat suspicious. The conten-,25
NA,tion that day labour is unsatisfactory is,25
NA,"all nonsense, for the simple reason, as",25
NA,"I have pointed out before, that i t all",25
NA,depends on the organization; and i t is,25
NA,"an insult to the Government, and to the",25
NA,army of trained engineers who are at,25
NA,"their service, to suggest that they can-",25
NA,not successfully carry out public works.,25
NA,"We all know what happens when, under",25
NA,"# private contracts, the - specifications are",25
NA,departed f r o m ; and i n this connexion,25
NA,alone there must be great savings under,25
NA,"the system of day labour, wliich permits",25
NA,variation as the circumstances demand.,25
Mr GLYNN ,Th e amendment would,25
NA,"prevent a modified contract system, which",25
NA,was one of the suggestions I made. The,25
NA,amendment ties my hands; and I think,25
NA,that the modified system would be the,25
NA,best for tlie men.,25
Mr ARCHIBALD , F o r many years,25
NA,past I have been i n favour of what is,25
NA,"called the "" b u t t y g a n g "" system, which",25
NA,has worked very satisfactorily. For the,25
NA,reasons I have given I think the,25
NA,did not amendment of the Seuate ought to be,25
NA,accepted.,25
Mr SAMPSON ,Wimmera) [12.42].,25
NA,The time has passed fo r a general dis-,25
NA,cussion on the relative merits of the,25
NA,day-labour and contract systems. One,25
NA,of the objections I - have to the amend-,25
NA,ment is that i t ties the Government down,25
NA,"to one course of action, and presents",25
NA,no opportunity f Â« r comparison between,25
NA,the two systems. The Northern Terri-,26
NA,"tory is very isolated, and, considering its",26
NA,"distance from the seat of government,",26
NA,the danger of lax supervision is very,26
NA,much increased.,26
Mr FALKINER ,Tha t is,26
NA,trouble i n regard to day labour-th e,26
NA,supervision.,26
Mr SAMPSON ,Quit e so.,26
NA,are times when advantages i n both sys-,26
NA,tems might be discovered i n practice. I n,26
NA,"Victoria some years ago, after the ap-",26
NA,pointment of the Railways Standing Com-,26
NA,"mittee, certain railways were, on the re-",26
NA,"commendation of that body, constructed",26
NA,"by day labour, but the whole administra-",26
NA,"tion, through the investigations of the",26
NA,"Committee, was revolutionized, so that",26
NA,"there can be no analogy drawn, or com;",26
NA,"parison made. Under the circumstances,",26
NA,day labour having apparently proved so,26
NA,"beneficial i n Queensland, i t seems to me",26
NA,that there is good reason for giving the,26
NA,Queensland Goyernment an opportunity,26
NA,ito tender for this railway.,26
Mr THOMAS ,Doe s the honorable,26
NA,member suggest that the Queensland,26
NA,Government will tender ?,26
Mr SAMPSON , I understand that,26
NA,i n South Australia the Government ten-,26
NA,der for Government work.,26
Mr THOMAS ,"Yes , for their own",26
NA,work; but would the Queensland Govern-,26
NA,ment tender for Commonwealth work ?,26
Mr SAMPSON ,Th e honorable mem-,26
NA,ber for Brisbane suggested that we,26
NA,should get the Queensland Government,26
NA,to construct this line.,26
Mr THOMAS ,Tha t is a different,26
NA,thing.,26
Mr SAMPSON ,I f the Queensland,26
NA,Government have all the necessary,26
NA,"equipment, why should they not under-",26
NA,take the work? 1,26
NA,for Wakefield has placed i n my hands,26
NA,some very interesting figures i n regard,26
NA,to South Australia. I n the case of the,26
NA,"Brownlow railway, a line 90 miles i n",26
NA,"length, tenders were called from outside",26
NA,"contractors, and the Government itself",26
NA,also put i n a price. The figures show,26
NA,"that the Government tender was Â£155,000",26
NA,The next tender was submitted by a pri-,26
NA,"vate contractor for Â£105,000, and the",26
NA,tender that was accepted was from a,26
NA,"private contractor for Â£89,000, or 60 per",26
NA,"cent, lower than the Government tender.",26
Mr LAIRD SMITH ,Bu t what,26
NA,did he get?,26
Mr RICHARD FOSTER ,Ther e were,26
NA,practically none.,26
Mr SAMPSON , I think i t must be,26
NA,clear that i f we are to carry out our i m -,26
NA,"portant works by day labour, without",26
NA,the whole having any of the disciplinary elements,26
NA,"of competition, our works w i l l necessarily",26
NA,be expensive. I do not intend to talk,26
NA,"There about the element of "" Government",26
NA,"stroke "" ""referred to by some honorable",26
NA,members; but when we eliminate competi-,26
NA,tion we set up an expensive system of,26
NA,"carrying out works, whether under pri-",26
NA,vate or under Government supervision.,26
NA,"I n my own district, postal work has been",26
NA,"done by day labour, and i t has been",26
NA,fairly expensive. I quite realize that,26
NA,there are small works that may be car-,26
NA,ried out by the Government under the,26
NA,"day-labour system, because the Govern-",26
NA,"ment have their own plant, and contrac-",26
NA,tors cannot be got to tender for work i n,26
NA,every part of the country.,26
The CHAIRMAN , I cannot allow,26
NA,anything but an occasional reference to,26
NA,matters outside railway construction.,26
Mr SAMPSON , I was merely using,26
NA,the outside work as an illustration. I,26
NA,was saying that the day-labour system,26
NA,may be employed by the. Commonwealth,26
NA,in certain small works; but I hold that,26
NA,"important public works, involving the",26
NA,"expenditure of hundreds of thousands,",26
NA,should be treated i n a different fashion.,26
NA,"The Commonwealth Parliament, as trus-",26
NA,"tees of the public money, should not",26
NA,"spend that money i n the way i t thinks fit,",26
NA,"or as a matter of patronage, or at the",26
NA,dictation of any section of the com-,26
NA,munity. I t is our duty to spend the,26
NA,money of the public to the very best ad-,26
NA,"vantage, and, i n accordance with our",26
NA,"wisdom, to devise means of carrying out",26
NA,public works i n the most economical way.,26
NA,The honorable member We are not justified i n introducing a,26
NA,system which prevents the Government,26
NA,carrying out those works with the elimi-,26
NA,nation of those elements of competition,26
NA,that are necessary to bring about the best,26
NA,results from the expenditure of public,26
NA,money.,26
Mr RILEY ,South Sydney) [12.50].,26
NA,- I hope that supporters of the Ministry,26
NA,will look at this question from a dif-,26
NA,ferent stand-point. I f we are to invite,26
NA,contractors to submit tenders fo r the con-,26
NA,struction of a railway i n the Northern,26
NA,"Territory, quite away from regular sup-",26
NA,"extras plies and from bodies of men, they must",26
NA,add to their prices a very large margin.,26
NA,I know something about contracting. I f,27
NA,"I tendered for this work, I would",27
NA,"a certain margin, because of the great risk that country.",27
NA,I should r u n i n getting labour there.,27
Mr RICHARD FOSTER ,Th e,27
NA,ment run the same risk.,27
Mr RILEY , B u t the difference,27
NA,that i f the Government frame a high,27
NA,"estimate for the work, and there is",27
NA,"saving effected, the Commonwealth benethey",27
NA,fits by the saving; whereas the contractor,27
NA,who submits a high price on account of the,27
NA,"risks, and effects a saving, gets all the",27
NA,advantage. Another point is that a conprice,27
NA,tractor must take a complete plant to,27
NA,"Northern Territory, and i t w i l l not",27
NA,him to take i t away again.,27
NA,Mr RICHA BD FOSTEB -Th e Governployed.,27
NA,ment will have to do the same.,27
Mr RILEY , N o . As the Governrisk,27
NA,ment intend to continue a railway policy extras.,27
NA,"there, the plant required for the con-",27
NA,struction of 50 miles of railway will come,27
NA,"i n handy f o r future extensions, and i t fore.",27
NA,can be stored i n the Northern Territory.,27
NA,We must look upon the building of this,27
NA,railway as an experiment. I,27
NA,tenders certainly there will be a very,27
NA,high price placed upon the construction of,27
NA,the line; but i f the Government decide to,27
NA,"build the railway, though the estimate",27
NA,of the Department may also be very,27
NA,"high, any saving effected w i l l be secured",27
NA,by the Government.,27
NA,will be able ito get people to go there,27
NA,work for them more readily than private,27
NA,employers can. Men always,27
NA,"Government employment, because their for",27
NA,"money is secure, and, as a rule, they are railway.",27
NA,not bullocked so hard. Not only has,27
NA,contractor to reckon on paying higher,27
NA,wages to induce men to go to the,27
NA,"thern Territory, b u t he must add 10",27
NA,"cent, or 15 per cent.",27
NA,"gencies, which there is no need f o",27
NA,Government to do. The surveyors may,27
NA,"alter a route, or build two arches instead",27
NA,"of one over a river, and i f the work",27
NA,"being carried out by contract, and",27
NA,"specification is altered i n one detail,",27
NA,contract is broken.,27
Mr LAIRD SMITH ," A n d then the f u n Â£1,000 less per mile than",27
NA,starts.,27
Mr RILEY , W h e n a contractor,27
NA,a contract; especially from the Governis,27
NA,"ment, his first aim is to get away",27
NA,the contract.,27
Mr FALKINER ," I f he can do so, does",27
NA,i t not show inefficiency on the part of the,27
NA,Department ?,27
Mr RILEY , N o surveyor or drafts-,27
NA,put on man can be absolutely accurate i n,27
NA,There will certainly,27
NA,be alterations to the original plans;,27
NA,Governand i t is no reflection on the De-,27

NA,is ing a lighter grade may save hun-,27
NA,dreds of thousands of pounds i n haulage.,27
NA,"anyThese things always happen, but when",27
NA,do occur the contractor claims that,27
NA,"the contract has been broken, and that",27
NA,he need not build the railway i n a certain,27
NA,time. A l l these things tend to keep up the,27
NA,of a work under the contract system.,27
NA,the Under the departmental system of carry-,27

NA,brains i n the Department can be em-,27

Mr JOSEPH COOK , I wonder i f we,27
NA,have not ever discussed this question be-,27
Mr RILEY , W e have; but we cannot,27
NA,let the statements of honorable members,27
NA,f we call for go without some reply.,27
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I am afraid hon-,27
NA,orable members on both sides are alike.,27
Mr RILEY ,Honorabl e members re-,27
NA,presenting South Australian constitu-,27
NA,encies have said that the construction of,27
NA,The Government railways i n New South Wales under the,27
NA,and day-labour system has cost more than con-,27
NA,struction under the contract system.,27
NA,"prefer There has been a great deal of criticism,",27
NA,"example, of the North Coast",27
NA,That line has been con-,27
NA,the structed at Tess than the Government,27

NA,r the standing the onslaught he made on this,27
NA,"railway, has been compelled to admit that",27
NA,the line has cost less than the original,27
NA,"is estimate. Mr Holman, the Premier of",27
NA,"the New South Wales,"" has pointed out that",27
NA,the the policy of building railways i n New,27

NA,gets way Commissioner i n New South Wales,27
NA,not bound to carry out any deviations,27
NA,from in railway construction by day labour;,27
NA,he can let contracts; but all the deviation,27
NA,work on the Blue Mountains has been car-,27
NA,ried out departmentally under the day-,27
NA,"labour system, and the work had been",27
NA,done cheaper than under the former,28
NA,system of contract work-,28
Mr FALKINER ,l t the supervision,28

Mr RILEY ,Thaf c is the whole thing.,28
NA,"I f the supervision is right, and the men",28
NA,employed are not delayed i n the matter,28
NA,"of material, the Government ought to",28
NA,construct a work by the day-labour system,28
NA,at least as cheaply as any contractor can,28
NA,do i t .,28
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,D o you not,28
NA,that we might experiment in a better,28
NA,place than i n the Northern Territory?,28
NA,Why tie the hands of the Government in,28
NA,"regard to the Northern Territory, when",28
NA,the great tiling ib to get anything done in,28
NA,any circumstances ?,28
Mr RILEY , I was pointing out at the,28
NA,outset of my remarks that i t was a great,28
NA,experiment to ask a contractor to take,28
NA,labour to the Northern Territory and,28
NA,"build this railway, and that as the con-",28
NA,"tractor would be taking so many risks,",28
NA,"ho would be sure to put up his price, and",28
NA,thus the building of the line would be,28
NA,more expensive.,28
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Bu t why,28
NA,hands of the Government up there above,28
NA,all other places?,28
Mr RILEY , T h e Government have,28
NA,announced their policy as a policy of as-,28
NA,"sisting contractors. We, on the other",28
NA,"hand, stand for a policy of day labour.",28
NA,Mir. JOSEPH COOK -Ar e you not madly,28
NA,running your theory by starting i t in the,28
NA,Northern Territory?,28
Mr RILEY , N o . The Government,28
NA,"have the land surveyed and the plans, and",28
NA,all they require are the men and mate-,28
NA,"rial, so that there will be no risk in build-",28
NA,ing this railway by day labour.,28
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Yo u are,28
NA,with this Bil l as you never thought of,28
NA,dealing with the Bills of your party. Is,28
NA,that fair treatment or fair play?,28
Mr RILEY , T f the Labour party,28
NA,were in power we would insist on this,28
NA,railway being built by day labour.,28
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Yo u would,28
NA,give a thought to i t .,28
Mr RILEY ," I n my opinion, the",28
NA,Senate had a perfect right to amend the,28
NA,"Bill i n this direction, and I shall give m j",28
NA,"vote lo support their action, because i t is",28
NA,in the interests of the country. I resent,28
NA,"the aitacKS ""that havo been made on work-",28
NA,ing men. I t is said that because men,28
NA,work with picks and shovels they go i n,28
NA,for the Government stroke. I resent tMs,28
NA,slander upon them. Workmen have done,28
NA,is just as good work for the Government as,28
NA,has been done for private contractors.,28
NA,The Prime Minister will remember that,28
NA,when he was Postmaster-General in New,28
NA,South Wales he carried out that splendid,28
NA,work of constructing telephone tunnels,28
NA,through Sydney. He increased wages to,28
NA,"the men, and tlte tunnels were made three",28
NA,"inches iarger, necessitating the use of",28
NA,"think millions of bricks more, yet ""the whole",28
NA,work was done under the day-labour,28
NA,system i n better style and at a saving of,28
NA,"Â£29,000. The first section of the tunnels",28
NA,was carried oufc by contract at so much,28
NA,"per cubic yard, and when tlie work was",28
NA,"measured up and compared ""with what",28
NA,"was done with day labour, this saving was",28
NA,shown to have been made. I n addition,28
NA,the Government paid men with horses,28
NA,and drays two shillings a day more than,28
NA,the contractor paid. W i t h these facts be-,28
NA,"fore me, I cannot support any proposal",28
NA,to bring about the pernicious system of,28
NA,letting contracts. The contractor always,28
NA,tries to get more .out of the worker. I,28
NA,have worked as builder on contract aud,28
NA,"tie the on day labour, aiid my experience is that",28
NA,"the Government will get"" a better class of",28
NA,"men, that the men will get a better deal",28
NA,from the Government than from private,28
NA,"contractors, and that this work will be",28
NA,constructed cheaper by clay labour than,28
NA,by letting a tender.,28
Mr WEST ,East Sydney) [12.59] - I,28
NA,have no desire to be dictated to by the,28
NA,Senate. The Senate is supposed to re-,28
NA,"present the States, and two States-Ne w",28
NA,South Wales and Queensland-hav e de-,28
NA,cided that the work of building railways,28
NA,shall be carried out by day labour.,28
NA,dealing Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.30 p.m.,28
Mr WEST ,"Whethe r the Senate, i u",28
NA,"making the amendments, is playing a",28
NA,"sensible game, or is merely endeavouring",28
NA,"to show its strength, is a, matter that",28
NA,"does not concern this Committee, so long",28
NA,as the Senate has not exceeded its con-,28
NA,not stitutional powers. I t may be thought,28
NA,that there would be a loss of dignity in,28
NA,"accepting this amendment, but that con-",28
NA,sideration should not receive much,28
NA,"weight, because we have*already accepted",28
NA,another amendment made by the Senate,28
NA,"in this B i l l , and have accepted amend-",28
NA,ments made by i t in several otherBills.,28
NA,Those who have visited the Northern,28
NA,Territory w i l l agree that i t would be,28
NA,abaurd to attempt to construct the pro-,29
NA,posed railway by contract. No con-,29
NA,tractor would tender for the work,29
NA,except at an extravagant price: Por,29
NA,"one thing, the proposed line begins at",29
NA,"a"" place 150 miles away from Port Dar-",29
NA,"win, and there is no timber suit-",29
NA,able for railway construction between,29
NA,"Port Darwin and Pine Creek, so that",29
NA,practically all the material required,29
NA,would have to be carried over the exist-,29
NA,"ing railway. Again, were a private con-",29
NA,"tractor to tender for the work, he would",29
NA,have to make a heavy charge to cover,29
NA,contingencies. He would be greatly,29
NA,handicapped i n the obtaining of labour.,29
NA,The .nearest place at which he could get,29
NA,the necessary labour would be somewhere,29
NA,"in Queensland, and i t would cost a good",29
NA,"deal to take men to the Territory, even",29
NA,from Queensland. Men going there,29
NA,"would require some security, and i t",29
NA,would be much easier for the Government,29
NA,to obtain labour than for a contractor to,29
NA,do so. The proposal of the Senate is one,29
NA,whose adoption would serve the interests,29
NA,of the taxpayers. We are told that the,29
NA,measure is urgent because i t is desirable,29
NA,to proceed with the making of the rail-,29
NA,way at once. B u t i f the contract system,29
NA,"be adopted, there, must be delay, because",29
NA,no contractor will tender until he has,29
NA,gone over the route and carefully con-,29
NA,sidered the specifications. There are not,29
NA,many engineering difficulties along the,29
NA,"route. The country is level, so that there",29
NA,would be no grades of more than 1 in,29
NA,"200, and not many bridges will be",29
NA,"needed. The MCDonald, the Mclntyre,",29
NA,and the Perguson Rivers will have to be,29
NA,crossed.,29
Mr GLYNN ,An d the Edith River.,29
Mr WEST ,Provisio n will also have,29
NA,to be made for crossing the depressions,29
NA,which in the rainy season become water-,29
NA,courses. The honorable member for,29
NA,Riverina has spoken of the need for,29
NA,"supervision, but, i f the work were done",29
NA,"by contract, the Government would have",29
NA,to employ an army of supervisors to see,29
NA,"that i t was being done properly, and",29
NA,these men might equally well be em-,29
NA,ployed i n directly supervising Govern-,29
NA,ment employes. The plant required,29
NA,"would not be very expensive, and could",29
NA,be used afterwards for the maintenance,29
NA,"of the existing line, and for carrying out",29
NA,extensions. The honorable member for,29
NA,Wakefield is always in a state of excite-,29
NA,"ment, and seems to lose his reason when",29
NA,"he speaks, but he makes statements that",29
NA,almost compel an answer. The saving,29
NA,on the Queensland railways by the adop-,29
NA,tion of day labour in their construction,29
NA,"has been from Â£900 to Â£1,200 a mile.",29
NA,The Queensland railways that were con-,29
NA,structed by contractors were for 8-ton,29
NA,"axles, whereas those which have been made",29
NA,"with day labour are for 12-ton axles, as",29
NA,"are also those of New South Wales, where",29
NA,"the saving has been from Â£1,000 to",29
NA,"Â£1,900 a mile. The present Secretary",29
NA,for Public Works i n New South .Wales,29
NA,was forced to adopt the' day-labour sys-,29
NA,"tem in the public interest on one line,",29
NA,for which the lowest tender was,29
NA,"Â£300,000 above . the estimate, a sav-",29
NA,"ing of 33 per cent, being made by",29
NA,the adoption of the day-labour system.,29
NA,The States are all adopting that system,29
NA,"now, not only for railway construction,",29
NA,but also for the building of railways and,29
NA,"rolling-stock, and we should follow their",29
NA,example. The railway from Port Dar-,29
NA,win to Pine Creek was constructed with,29
NA,"Chinese labour, a fact that accounts for",29
NA,the presence of so many Chinese in the,29
NA,Territory. The contractors employed,29
NA,"that labour because they said that, i t",29
NA,was more certain than white labour i n,29
NA,the Territory. I t being one of the prin-,29
NA,ciples of tbe Liberal party to encourage,29
NA,the contract system in connexion with,29
NA,"the Commonwealth public works, we on",29
NA,this side naturally fear that i t will apply,29
NA,that system to the construction of the,29
NA,"proposed line, and therefore we are mak-",29
NA,ing a fight for our own views and our,29
NA,own opinions. The majority in the Sen-,29
NA,ate is sure to insist on this amendment.,29
NA,I f there were twenty-nine Liberals in the,29
NA,"Senate, they would turn down every pro-",29
NA,"posal made by a Labour Government, and",29
NA,"this Government, although Ministers may",29
NA,"dislike i t , must recognise the position. I n",29
NA,"tho present position of parties, we on this",29
NA,side cannot be expected to forego our,29
NA,principles. What has kept us i n power,29
NA,"so long, and has made our supporters so",29
NA,"loyal, is that we hold our political prin-",29
NA,ciples as sacred as our religious beliefs.,29
NA,I f there were any disagreement between,29
NA,the Department and the contractors at,29
NA,that distance from the main centres of,29
NA,"population, the cost would be enormous.",29
NA,There will be no loss of dignity to the,29
NA,Ministerial party i n accepting the amend-,29
NA,ment. I am sure the people will indorse,29
NA,the Minister's action i f he agrees with,29
NA,the Senate instead of tryin g to create a,29
NA,bogy to frighten honorable members,30
NA,the other side of the House.,30
NA,really nothing for them to fear.,30
Mr THOMAS ,Hi s own party in the,30
NA,Senate were not in favour of it .,30
Mr WEST ,Th e position is really,30
NA,laughable.,30
Mr GLYNN ,Thi s amendment would,30
NA,render impossible the letting of,30
NA,modified contracts to the men.,30
Mr WEST , I believe that is so.,30
NA,do not think i t is possible to find,30
NA,"body to take the responsibility of carrytralia,",30
NA,ing out that 50 miles of railway by,30
NA,"tract, i t would be something like putting",30
NA,our money on a horse. A man would,30
NA,I ave to take the contract at a ridiculous,30
NA,"price, in order to have a possibility",30
NA,making something but of f t . The Prime,30
NA,Minister knows all the facts with regard,30
NA,"to day labour, and if he were allowed",30
NA,speak the truth he would say that,30
NA,Was the proper way to carry out this,30
NA,Work. I have some sympathy with him,30
NA,"la his position, because I know that",30
NA,he consulted his own views in the matter,30
NA,he would not hesitate as to what he would,30
NA,do. I f he had a knowledge of the NorthThere,30
NA,ern Territory he would be more convinced,30
NA,than ever that i t was impossible for,30
NA,man to take a contract there unless,30
NA,got an extraordinary price. A very large method.,30
NA,army of officers will be needed to super-,30
NA,"Vise the contract, and there will be great trouble",30
NA,difficulty in getting them there. I t is,30
NA,really a day-labour line. I quite under-,30
NA,stand that the Ministry object to being,30
NA,"dictated to, and if the Senate were",30
NA,strongly in favour of tlie day-labour,30
NA,tem I am sure they would not have proing,30
NA,"posed the amendment, knowing as they",30
NA,do that the Government are opposed,30
NA,it. I f the Government do the work by,30
NA,"contract, and make a loss, people will",30
NA,have to put up with i t through haying,30
NA,put into power a Government which is in,30
NA,favour of that policy. I would like to,30
NA,"the Bill passed, and I hope the Governnot",30
NA,"ment will not throw i t out, but will accept",30
NA,the amendment. I am sure the Senate,30
NA,proposed it in the interests of the taxwork,30
NA,payer; and that fact should be a cona,30
NA,sideration to the Government.,30
Mr BAMFORD ,Herbert) [2.48] -,30
NA,"should not have risen, but for the rethat",30
NA,marks of -the honorable member for,30
NA,Wakefield. I deprecate the manner,30
NA,which he associated my name with the,30
NA,transcontinental railway. I am quite,30
NA,willing to support the honorable member,30
NA,on m everything he has said regarding the,30
NA,There is maladministration of the Port Augusta,30
NA,"to Kalgoorlie railway, but he should not",30
NA,imply that I said that the fault was due,30
NA,to day labour. The fault was entirely,30
NA,due to mismanagement. The line has,30
NA,"been grossly mismanaged, and it is not",30
NA,owing to day labour that the cost has been,30
NA,small so high. From information I have re-,30
NA,ceived from a credible source the work,30
NA,I is being done more cheaply than on any,30
NA,anyother line of a similar character in Aus-,30
NA,or than i i ever was done in Aus-,30
NA,contralia. The cost of the plate-laying is,30
NA,less per yard that i t ever has been on,30
NA,any other line o f t h e same gauge or the,30
NA,same weight of rails-8 0 lb. The earth-,30
NA,"of work is done as cheaply, i f not more",30
NA,cheaply than elsewhere. I t is all a ques-,30
NA,"tion of management, and i f the Govern-",30
NA,to ment were to adopt a similar policy of,30
NA,that management in regard to the Northern,30
NA,Territory railway construction I should,30
NA,be entirely opposed to it. I t would be,30
NA,"if much more costly than is necessary, and",30
NA,the time taken in the construction of the,30
NA,line would be much longer than is needed.,30
NA,is no reason why the Government,30
NA,should not get the work done economic-,30
NA,a ally and well by day labour. I f properly,30
NA,"he supervised, day labour is the cheaper",30
Mr FALKINER ,I s not that the whole,30
NA,?,30
Mr BAMFORD ,Supervisio n is the,30
NA,whole trouble. I have been on railway,30
NA,not work where men have been sent to the,30
NA,sysman in charge with a note recommend-,30
NA,that they be put on. I f the man in,30
NA,"charge is a strong man, who knows his",30

NA,not take anybody selected by the Minister.,30
NA,That is the position which should be,30
NA,"taken up, but i t is not taken up with re-",30
NA,"gard to these railways. I f i t was, there",30
NA,see would be no reason why the work should,30
NA,be constructed by day labour. I f it,30
NA,"is a question of sub-contract, or giving a",30
NA,guarantee that the contractor will do the,30
NA,"more cheaply, i t will mean taking",30
NA,"good deal more out of the men, but",30
NA,the benefit of that will go into the pockets,30
NA,"of the contractor, and not into the coffers",30
NA,I of the Treasury. The contractor does-,30
NA,sort of thing for his own benefit. I,30
NA,"have been a contractor myself, and know",30
NA,in how things are worked. Three or four,30
NA,"men meet together, and say, "" We do not.",30
NA,"want a job; let A have i t, as he wants",30
NA,"i t . "" A then shows his estimate to them,",30
NA,aud they put i n their tenders i n such,31
NA,"a way that A ' s is the lowest, and he gets",31
NA,the work. Everybody who has been i n,31
NA,the swim knows that that is done.,31
NA,Local supervision of the work w i l l be re-,31
NA,"quired. We need local men i f possible,,",31
NA,"or, at any rate, men who are acclimatized,",31
NA,to act as supervisors. I am going to make,31
NA,a sporting offer to the Government. I,31
NA,will supervise the transcontinental railway,31
NA,from Port 'Augusta to Kalgoorlie for,31
NA,"Â£3,000 a year, and guarantee to do the",31
NA,"work i n less than three years, and",31
NA,"save the country at least Â£250,000 .",31
NA,I hope that the Government will accept,31
NA,"the Senate's amendment; but, i f they",31
NA,insist upon adopting the contract sys-,31
NA,"tem, I trust that they wil l at least modify",31
NA,"their attitude, and let more than one",31
NA,contract for the work.,31
Mr GLYNN ,W e have not done any-,31
NA,"thing, but the recommendation was that,",31
NA,assuming that we adoptecl the contract,31
NA,"system, we might modify i t to some ex-",31
NA,"tent. That, however, cannot be done i f",31
NA,this amendment be accepted.,31

Mr BAMFORD , W e are wedded to,31
NA,"the day-labour system, and rightly so,",31

NA,by experience to be the best.,31
Mr FLEMING ,Experienc e,31
NA,South Wales has been against railway,31
NA,construction by day labour.,31
Mr BAMFORD , N o t at all. Taking,31
NA,"all the conditions into consideration, we",31
NA,"find that the day-labour system, even i n",31
NA,"New South Wales, has been a pronounced",31
NA,"success, and we are perfectly justified i n",31
NA,the attitude that we are now taking up.,31
Mr FENTON ,Maribyrnong) [3.3] -,31
NA,I should not be at all apprehensive as,31
NA,to what the Minister of External Affairs,31
NA,"might do i f he were left, to himself i n",31
NA,"this matter, but I am apprehensive of",31
NA,what the Government as a whole may do.,31
NA,There is a strong desire on the part of,31
NA,the Cabinet to give preference to con-,31
NA,"tractors at all hazards, and I am inclined",31
NA,to think that contractors will get a very,31
NA,big pull on Government moneys. I do,31
NA,not know how many workmen the M i n -,31
NA,ister has i n the Northern Territory.,31
Mr GLYNN ," I was advised, in August,",31
NA,that about seventy men could be placed,31
NA,at once.,31
Mr FENTON , I know one man up,31
NA,there who is described by the Adminis-,31
NA,trator as a very valuable officer. He is,31
NA,"not i n the permanent service, but he",31
NA,married a native of the Northern Terri-,31
NA,tory- a daughter of a school teacher-,31
NA,and is likely to become a permanent re-,31
NA,sident. Letters that I have received,31
NA,from him lead me to believe that the,31
NA,Territory is not nearly so bad as i t is,31
NA,painted. He and several ethers now en-,31
NA,gaged on Government works would be,31
NA,able to play an important part i n the,31
NA,construction of this line on the day-labour,31
NA,"system. .The work involves, not merely",31
NA,"the laying of sleepers and rails, but the",31
NA,"erection of a number of buildings, and",31
NA,we have a number of practical builders,31
NA,i n the Territory.,31
Mr GLYNN ,Som e of the building,31
NA,work now i n hand i n the Territory is,31
NA,"nearly finished, and we shall have these",31
NA,men unemployed i f we do not get this,31
NA,B i l l through.,31
Mr FENTON ," W e should, avail our-",31
NA,selves of the labour already i n the T e r r i-,31
NA,tory. We have experts there.,31
NA,NA,31
Mr FENTON , I have always ob-,31
NA,jected to the employment of a number,31
NA,of experts to prepare plans and specifi-,31
NA,"cations for contracts, and thereafter to",31
NA,watch the contractors to see that they,31
NA,are doing their work properly. W h y,31
NA,should not these expertsundertake the,31
NA,whole work for the Government under the,31
NA,in New day-labour system? I t must be remem-,31
NA,bered t h a t we already have steamers of,31
NA,our. own which could carry rails and',31
NA,sleepers for less than a contractor would,31
NA,have to pay.,31
Mr LAIRD SMITH ,Th e Government,31
NA,will have to pay for thecarriage of rails,31
NA,and sleepers i f we let a contract.,31
Mr FENTON , I f the Government,31
NA,aregoing to carry' the' rails and sleepers,31
NA,"to thespot, why should they not go a",31
NA,step further' and place them i n position,31
NA,1,31
NA,under the day-labour system? We have,32
NA,in the Northern 'Territorya splendid,32
NA,opportunity to put that system into,32
NA,"operation, and I am sure that we could",32
NA,construct the line for less than any con-,32
NA,tractor could do. Even such a Tory,32
NA,newspaper as the Brisbane Courier con-,32
NA,fessed i n a recent issue that the day-,32
NA,labour system was far preferable to the,32
NA,contract system. I t said that- -,32
NA,The contract system was discarded in,32
NA,"land, in the first place, because it was",32
NA,pensive. The Government have carried,32
NA,"works-railwa y and others-t o retain the profit, toria.",32
NA,which went to the contractor.,32
NA,That is a very strong point. A man who,32
NA,takes a contract can make money out of,32
NA,"i t , only by getting more out of his",32
NA,"than he ought to do-b y working them a sum than Â£350,000.",32
NA,long hours on small pay-o r dipping,32
NA,the Treasury. I f we let a contract for,32
NA,this line we may find i t necessary to,32
NA,i t later on. As the honorable member,32
NA,"South Sydney has pointed out, as soon",32
NA,a contractor enters upon a work he enmore,32
NA,deavours to point out something outside,32
NA,"the contract that ought to be carried out,",32
NA,and directly tlie contract is departed,32
NA,he gets his extras. I want to .stop that,32
NA,sort of thing. The Minister says,32
NA,has men available for this work.,32
NA,NA,32
NA,opportunity to take small .contracts?,32
Mr FENTON ,Th e evidence,32
NA,whelmingly against the contract system.,32
NA,W i t h proper supervision the day-labour,32
NA,system will save us thousands of pounds.,32
NA,That has been the experience i n Victhe,32
NA,"toria, where the contract system, i",32
NA,"nexion with railway construction,",32
NA,been abandoned for years. I n reply,32
NA,the honorable member for Wakefield who,32
NA,referred to the Government Printing ment,32
NA,"Office i n Adelaide, I would say that,",32
NA,"few years ago, private printing firms",32
NA,this city declared that they could do,32
NA,the Government printing for less than,32
NA,was costing i n the State Printing Office. strong for me.,32
NA,"The Government Printer said at once,",32
NA,""" Call for tenders."" His advice was",32
NA,"cepted, tenders were invited, and those",32
NA,put i n by the Government Printer were,32
NA,hundreds of pounds below those of the,32
NA,outside contractors. The contract sysevery,32
NA,tem everywhere is being discarded. Muniold-fashioned,32
NA,"cipalities prefer the day-labour system,",32
NA,"and a big business man, like Mr Angliss,",32
NA,"M . L . C , who erects many large buildfered",32
NA,"ings, has them built by day labour.",32
NA,says that he has no time f o r the conand,32
NA,tract system. I n advocating day labour,32
NA,we believe that we should get a fair re-,32
NA,t u r n for fair wages. We are not going,32
NA,to support the loafer and the waster. We,32
NA,"want a fair return for a fair wage, and",32
NA,if we' get that we shall be satisfied.,32
Dr MALONEY ,Melbourne) [3.15].,32
NA,"-Thi s proposal opens up a great vista,",32
NA,but I do not propose to detain the Com-,32

The CHAIRMAN , I must ask the,32
NA,honorable member not to discuss these,32
NA,is overmatters more than incidentally.,32
Dr MALONEY , I n the case of this,32
NA,"Parliament House, the contractor failed",32
NA,"to bribe the inspector of plastering, and",32
NA,result was that the latter was dis-,32

NA,"Melbourne, he should look at the stone-",32
NA,"workof the second story, which was.",32

NA,the building was completed witli i n -,32

NA,contractors are as careless i n this respect,33

NA,That this Bill be now read a second time.,36
NA,I have already explained the purposes of,36
NA,the measure. Its introduction has be-,36
NA,come necessary by reason of the taking,36
NA,over of the Lighthouse Departments of,36
NA,"the'States, and the trained men who have",36
NA,been doing the work of those Depart-,36
NA,ments. The B i l l will prevent these men,36
NA,from being prejudicially affected by the,36
NA,"transfer, because i t wil l preserve all the",36
NA,rights and privileges which have accrued,36
NA,to them under State employment.,36
Mr THOMAS ,Will the Commonwealth,36
NA,have to pay the pensions of the men taken-,36
NA,over 1,36
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I t is a matter,36
NA,of arrangement with the Government of,36
NA,the State. We are doing i n con-,36
NA,nexion with these men what was done,36
NA,under the Constitution i n connexion with,36
NA,the transfer of the officers taken over by,36
NA,the Commonwealth at the beginning of,36
NA,Federation. A defect has been dis-,36
NA,covered i n our Public Service A c t which,36
NA,this Bill will remedy.,36
Mr TUDOR ,Yarra) [3.56] -Th e B i l l,36
NA,practically amends section 33 of the Pub-,36
NA,"lic Service Act, which reads-",36
NA,Anv person not more than sixty years of age,36
NA,who at the establishment of the Commonwealth,36
NA,was engaged in any office or employment in,36
NA,"the public, railway, or any other service of any",36
NA,State shall be eligible for appointment to a,36
NA,position in the corresponding division in the,36
NA,Public Service of the Commonwealth. On the,36
NA,recommendation of the Commissioner the pro-,36
NA,visions of this Act relating to the examination,36
NA,of candidates to appointments on probation to,36
NA,the division or class or subdivision of class and,36
NA,"the age of persons who ma""y be so appointed",36
NA,shall not apply to any such person. Provided,36
NA,thai any person in the Professional or Clerical,36
NA,Divisions of the Public Service of a State may,36
NA,be appointed to the Administrative Division.,36
NA,I understand that the B i l l provides that,36
NA,men transferred from State Services to the,36
NA,Commonwealth shall be put i n the same,36
NA,position as those who were transferred at,36
NA,"the beginning, of Federation. I t is",36
NA,proper that the accrued rights and privi -,36
NA,leges of transferred officers should be pre-,36
NA,"served, but we ought to take care not to",36
NA,make i t possible for men to get into the,36
NA,Commonwealth Service through the State,36
NA,Services more easily than they can get,36
NA,into the Commonwealth Service direct. I t,36
NA,may be that entrance to some of the State,36
NA,Services can be obtained without passing,36
NA,"an examination, or by passing an ex-",36
NA,amination which is easier than the Com-,36
NA,monwealth entrance examination.,36
Mr GROOM ,Thi s measure will be ap-,36
NA,plied only where large bodies of men are,36
NA,"transferred, as in the present instance,",36
NA,or in odd cases. Its provisions are not,36
NA,intended to be used generally.,36
Mr TUDOR ," I grant that, and I ad-",36
NA,mit that the Public Service Commis-,36
NA,"siouer is very careful, and will always",36
NA,exhaust tlie Commonwealth Service before,36
NA,going to a State Service for a man.,36
NA,"And rightly so, too.. But if we make ib",36
NA,easier for the men to come in from-,36
NA,the States than to enter the Com-,36
NA,"monwealth Service direct, they w i ll",36
NA,not be going up for our examina-,36
NA,"tions, but will go up for the State",36
NA,examinations. I want to make i t as,36
NA,easy for men to come directly into our,36
NA,"our Service as possible, as well as to cqme",36
NA,"in by the by-way of the State Services,",36
NA,if I may say so without offence to the,36
NA,"States, because capable men have been",36
NA,in exempt positions in the Commonwealth,36
NA,"Service for over twelve months, fulfillin g",36
NA,"the duties of their positions well, and are",36
NA,unable to come into tbe Public Service on,36
NA,account of the working of the Public Ser-,36
NA,vice Act. Had they gone for the State,36
NA,"Service, they might have got into the",36
NA,"Lighthouse, or some other Department,",36
NA,.and bave been transferred fo the Com-,36
NA,monwealth Service to-day. I have no ob-,36
NA,"jection to this B i l l , but I hope the M i n-",36

Mr LAIRD SMITH ,Denison) 4.2].,36
NA,r,36
NA,- I should like to know from the Prime,36
NA,Minister whether this measure will apply,36
NA,fco lighthouse officers now being taken over Mr THOMAS,37
NA,by the Commonwealth?,37
Mr GROOM ,Tha t is the reason f,37
Mr LAIRD SMITH , I am glad to,37
NA,"hear i t , because I have i n",37
NA,"case of a lighthouse engineer, who is",37
NA,"really an excellent man, and under the",37
NA,existing A c t i t is impossible f o r him,37
NA,be retained i n the service of the Comi,37
NA,monwealth. I t is exceedingly difficult,37
NA,get engineers capable of carrying out the,37
NA,work as that gentleman has,37
NA,"not only i n Australia, but i n the Old",37
NA,World. I am heartily i n accord with,37
NA,"measure, because i t will do much",37
NA,us to take over some very efficient men,37
NA,who are now i n the lighthouse services,37
NA,the various States.,37
Mr THOMAS ,Barrier) [4.3] -Per,37
NA,"sonally, I have no objection to the B i l l , but",37
NA,and am not going to oppose i t .,37
NA,understand that the B i l l enables an oflicer that,37
NA,to come over from the State Service,37
NA,"our Service, and bring his rights with",37
NA,him ? I f a State servant is entitled to a them.,37
NA,"pension, and we take him over under this",37
NA,"B i l l , would we become liable for his",37
NA,sion ? The Prime Minister said the B i l,37
NA,was to enable us to take over a State,37
NA,"servant i f we required him, ancl we agreed",37
NA,"with that, but I understood him to say",37
NA,"that, i n taking him over, we made his",37
NA,rights secure. Does that imply that i,37
NA,"has a right fco a State pension, we have Service.",37
NA,"to pay thafc pension? I f so, there will",37
NA,be a tendency to two classes i n our SerWill,37
NA,vice.,37
Mr JOSEPH COOK , N o ; you,37
NA,cure his accrued rights up to the time he,37
NA,is transferred.,37
Mr THOMAS ,The n i t means that,37
NA,we would have to pay his pension.,37
Mr JOSEPH COOK , N o ; i t means,37
NA,the State would pay i t under the terms,37
NA,of his transfer.,37
Mr THOMAS ,Th e States will have,37
NA,to agree fco that.,37
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I understand that,37
NA,-that is so with all transferred officers.,37
Mr GROOM ,W e take over these,37
NA,"cers, and this B i l l provides",37
NA,tinuing as Commonwealth public ser- .,37
NA,vants.,37
Mr THOMAS ,W e agree to that. person,37
NA,The question is who pays the pension.,37
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I think the States,37
NA,do.,37
Mr TUDOR ,The y pay their propor-,37
NA,tion for the time he was i n the State,37
NA,Service.,37
NA,- I suppose the States,37
NA,would be prepared to do t h a t ; but I,37
NA,or ifc. understand the B i l l goes further.,37
Mr GROOM ,I t makes a State officer,37
NA,my mind the eligible for appointment.,37
Mr THOMAS ,Decidedly . This B i l l,37
NA,goes f u r t h e r than the existing Public,37
NA,"to Service A c t, but I am not objecting to",37
NA,t. The Public Service A c t enables the,37
NA,to Public Service Commissioner to take over,37
NA,a State officer i f he was i n a State Ser-,37
NA,"been doing, vice previous to 1901.",37
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Th e A c t makes i t,37
NA,the mandatory on him to exhaust the Public,37
NA,to enable Service before going outside.,37
Mr THOMAS ,Tha t is quite a dif-,37
NA,i n ferent matter. The B i l l enables the,37
NA,"Public Service Commissioner, not only",37
NA,"- to take over a transferred officer,",37
NA,any oflicer who entered the,37
NA,Do I State Service after 1901. I think,37
NA,is a very good tiling. The,37
NA,to Prime Minister said that they brought,37
NA,over their rights and privileges with,37
NA,I am quite prepared to support,37
NA,fche Bill fco the extent of enabling the,37
NA,penPublic Service Commissioner to take ad-,37
NA,l vantage of the offer of any State officers,37
NA,who are prepared to come over. I shall,37
NA,be glad to seo the Public Service A c t so,37
NA,amended as fco enable the Commissioner,37
NA,to go outside i f he can get an abler man,37
NA,f he than there is i n the Pederal or State,37
Dr MALONEY ,Melbourne) [4.6] -,37
NA,this B i l l allow a system of pensions,37
NA,to creep into the Oommonwealth Service?,37
NA,"only seI f so, I should object to that.",37
Mr GROOM ,No .,37
Dr MALONEY , D o I understand,37
NA,that the State w i l l undertake to pay an,37
NA,officer whatever pension he is entitled to,37
NA,that under the State law when he retires from,37
NA,the Commonwealth Service ? I f he had,37
NA,"remained i n the State Service, that pen-",37
NA,sion would have increased as years went,37
NA,on. W i l l the Commonwealth have to pay,37
NA,"fchafc increase, or will ifc simply pay him",37
NA,his salary from the time he enters the,37
NA,offiCommonwealth Service? Section 61 o f,37
NA,for their conthe A c t says-,37
NA,For the purposes of this Act service in the,37
NA,"public, railway, or other service of a Slate by any",37
NA,who becomes an officer in the Public Ser-,37
NA,vice of the Commonwealth shall be reckoned as,37
NA,service in the Public Service of the Common-,37
NA,wealth.,37
NA,I take i t that i f an officer had ten years',37
NA,"service with a State, i t would give him a",37
NA,position i n the Commonwealth Service as,37
NA,i f he had served the ten years i n that,37
NA,Service. A l l I want to know is whether,38
NA,a system of pensions will be brought into,38
NA,"the Commonwealth Service, because I am",38
NA,absolutely opposed to i t .,38
NA,Mr W . H . IRVINE (Plinders-At -,38
NA,torney-General) [4.7] -Th e object of the,38
NA,B i l l is to render eligible certain persons,38
NA,who would nofc otherwise be eligible f or,38
NA,appointment. W i t h regard to the ques-,38
NA,tions how i t may. affect the rights of per-,38
NA,sons i n a State Service having accruing,38
NA,"pension rights, and to what extent the",38
NA,Commonwealth incurs any responsibility,38
NA,"with regard to those rights, and whether",38
NA,they will increase under the Common-,38
NA,"wealth r&gime, we have nothing to do so",38
NA,far as this B i l l is concerned. Probably,38
NA,"there will be no pensioners taken over, but",38
NA,let us assume that some are. Section 84 of,38
NA,the Constitution makes f u l l provision for,38
NA,officers who are transferred. These,38
NA,"not transferred officers, because this B",38
NA,does not deal w i t h transferred Depart-,38
NA,ments. The Lighthouse Department has,38
NA,"not been transferred, so that that sec-",38
NA,"tion does not apply, and there is no con-",38
NA,stitutional or statutory provision giving,38
NA,these officers who come over any statutory,38
NA,pension rights whatever. The question,38
NA,is what becomes of any pension rights,38
NA,they have. There is no compulsion on,38
NA,them to enter the service of the Common-,38
NA,wealth. The B i l l merely renders them,38
NA,eligible should they desire i t . Supposing,38
NA,we take over i n this case a public ser-,38
NA,vant who is already entitled to accruing,38
NA,"ension rights, the question is what is to",38
NA,"ecome of those rights, and who is respon-",38
NA,sible. That must be entirely a matter of,38
NA,agreement. The man need not come over.,38
NA,Supposing he has a pension right worth,38
NA,"a capitalized value of Â£200, whab becomes",38
NA,of it? We may say we invite him to,38
NA,"apply, with others, to enter the service",38
NA,"of the Commonwealth, but he need not",38
NA,"if he does not like to, and he still",38
NA,has his existing rights under,38
NA,Public Service A c t of the State.,38
NA,State is bound under the Public Service,38
NA,"law still to provide him a place, unless i t",38
NA,"abolishes his post. I f ifc does, the State",38
NA,has to make provision to do what,38
NA,is just regarding any accrued rights.,38
NA,"We are not compelling him to come over,",38
NA,"but i f he chooses to come, he must make",38
NA,his own arrangements with the State Go-,38
NA,vernment. We shall be prepared to give,38
NA,opportunities for such arrangements,38
NA,"being made, but shall take no financial",38
NA,responsibility. He w i l l enter our service,38
NA,as a newcomer. The only thing that will,38
NA,differentiate him i n any way from a man,38
NA,who enters the Commonwealth Service,38
NA,for the first time is the provision i n this,38
NA,B i l l which brings him under section 61,38
NA,of the Public Service A c t . That section,38
NA,is quite general i n its terms. Taken by,38
NA,"itself, however, i t would not apply to",38
NA,"such a man, because i t deals obviously",38
NA,with those transferred under section 60.,38
NA,But i t is expressly made applicable by,38
NA,"this B i l l , and we have to see what i t",38
NA,means. I t declares t h a t -,38
NA,For the purposes of this Act service in the,38
NA,"public, railway, or other service of a State by",38
NA,any person who become; an officer in the Public,38
NA,Service of the Commonwealth shall be reckoned,38
NA,as service in the Public Service of the Common-,38
NA,wealth.,38
NA,I t is to be reckoned i n relation only to,38
NA,are such matters as seniority with regard to,38
NA,"i l l subsequent promotion, or furlough. I f",38
NA,"we brought i n , say, an elderly man who",38
NA,had been i n the service of a State for,38
NA,"some years, we ought to offer him for",38
NA,these purposes the same rights fchafc he,38
NA,would have i f he had been fro m the com-,38
NA,mencement i n the service of the Common-,38
NA,wealth. Bufc the Commonwealth will not,38
NA,take over any responsibility with regard,38
NA,to that man's accrued rights. I n all,38
NA,probability he would be a non-pension,38
NA,"officer, but would have an insurance",38
NA,"policy, and i f he chose to keep i t i n force",38
NA,well and good.,38
Mr THOMAS , I think the explanation,38
NA,is quite sufficient.,38
Mr FENTON ,Suppos e he came over,38
NA,w i th pension rights?,38
NA,Mr W . H . IRVINE - H e could not,38
NA,come over with pension rights. Before,38
NA,he came over to the Commonwealth Ser-,38
NA,vice he would make his bargain with the,38
NA,State Government as to what was to be-,38
NA,come of those rights. No doubt the State,38
NA,the Government concerned' would treat him,38
NA,The fairly .,38
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Buf c if he resigned,38
NA,f r o m the State Service he would f o r f e i t,38
NA,his pension rights i n connexion w i t h i t .,38
NA,Mr W . H . IRVINE - Y e s ; i f this,38
NA,B i l l were not passed he would.,38
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,"Therefore , this",38
NA,B i l l is designed to conserve his pension,38
NA,rights.,38
NA,Mr W . H . IRVINE - I t is to give,38
NA,him an opportunity to enter into an,38
NA,agreement with the State which will pre-,38
NA,serve his pension rights.,38
Mr FENTON ,I f a man,39
NA,"t h i r t y years i n the State Service, and",39
NA,"only ten years i n our Service, should we",39
NA,have to pay him his pension when he re-,39
NA,tired ?,39
NA,Mr W . H . IRVINE - W e should pay,39
NA,him no pension whatever. I t would be,39
NA,entirely a matter of arrangement. The,39
NA,"State might say, "" I f you like to go over",39
NA,"to the Commonwealth Service, we will",39
NA,abolish your office and give you now the,39
NA,"value of your pension rights.""",39
Mr THOMAS ,O r i t might offer to find,39
NA,another billet f or him.,39
NA,Mr W . H . IRVINE - Q u i t e so. This,39

Mr FALKINER ,Riverina) [8.2] -,40
NA,The honorable member for Hume dealt,40
NA,with this B i l l from the scientific aspect.,40
NA,I shall not say anything about i t from,40
NA,"that point of view, but I would inform",40
NA,the honorable member for Capricornia,40
NA,t h a t ' this kind of legislation cannot be,40
NA,called Socialism and an aid to the far-,40
NA,mers and stock-owners i n New South,40
NA,Wales. They are very heavily taxed by,40
NA,the Pastures Protection Board for the,40
NA,"prevention of stock diseases, and the",40
NA,whole community benefits; but even i f i t,40
NA,"be so called, farmers and stock-owners are",40
NA,"the pioneers of the country, and i t is due",40
NA,"to their efforts that the towns exist, and,",40
NA,"therefore, they are entitled to some con-",40
NA,sideration. The farmers and stock-,40
NA,owners of Australia give the city workers,40
NA,all the monetary assistance they can by,40
NA,"supporting a protective policy, and all",40
NA,they ask for now i n return is an expendi-,40
NA,ture i n the shape of higher research i n,40
NA,"agriculture and stock diseases, which will",40
NA,have the result of bringing about a large,40
NA,national production and tend to cheapen,40
NA,living. As a matter of,40
NA,will also help to do .away,40
NA,a great deal of the Socialistic legislation,40
NA,that is now necessary i n the form of,40
NA,direct aid. The State institutions can still,40
NA,"continue their experimental farms, while",40
NA,the Federal Bureau of Agriculture can,40
NA,"pursue research work. So far, the",40
NA,State institutions have done very little,40
NA,for agriculture. They have certainly,40
NA,t i l advised the farmers in regard to the use,40
NA,"of superphosphates, but the use of these",40
NA,superphosphates was not the result of,40
NA,"their original research, because they",40
NA,were well known in England before,40
NA,they were spoken of i n Australia.,40
NA,There is the necessity for in-,40
NA,creasing the yield of our primary pro-,40
NA,ducts because of the increased cost of,40
NA,"government and production, and because",40
NA,of the claim for higher wages. I f the,40
NA,BILL. producers have to meet these demands,40
NA,"they must have increased yields, and they",40
NA,can only be obtained by -applying science,40
NA,to production from the soil i n a greater,40
NA,"Iu the past, Australia",40
NA,"suffered, as America did some time",40
NA,"back, from having too much land. When '",40
NA,land is plentiful and cheap the farmer,40
NA,is not obliged to put the labour into i t,40
NA,that he must when he has to adopt intense,40
NA,culture. The State institutions are really,40
NA,very little ahead of the methods of the,40
NA,formed.] Romans i n what they recommend to the,40
NA,farmers. Virgil mentions the necessity,40
NA,"for hand picking to get clean seed, and",40
NA,also the need for thoroughly working the,40
NA,"land after ploughing by harrowing, and",40
NA,"fallowing, and the rotation of crops. Ac-",40
NA,"cording to the Encyclopasdia Britannica,",40
NA,there are sixty institutions i n the United,40
NA,States of America. Fifty-five receive,40
NA,"Government aid, and they employ",40
NA,"795 , people, including seventy-one",40
NA,"directors and 163 scientific chemists,",40
NA,who deal with all phases of agricul-,40
NA,ture and diseases i n stock. They have,40
NA,men going all over the world looking,40
NA,for plants and seeds which may im-,40
NA,prove their own production. By the,40
NA,"improvement i n seed alone, the farmers i n",40
NA,the cotton belt of the United States of,40
NA,America have been raised from absolute,40
NA,poverty to plenty. There is no end to,40
NA,the scope ot this proposed bureau i n Aus-,40
NA,tralia. A large part of the Common-,40
NA,wealth has a hot climate and a light rain-,40
NA,"fall, and is of light carrying capacity. I n",40
NA,the western division of New South Wales,40
NA,"fact, i t there are .88,000,000 acres which, f u l l y",40
NA,"with stocked, will carry 7,000,000 or 8,000,000",40
NA,"sheep, but America would send men all",40
NA,over the world -to similar hot districts,40
NA,looking for grasses that would improve,40
NA,the carrying capacity of their land. I sug-,40
NA,gest to honorable members opposite that,40
NA,the time is coming when the pastoralists,40
NA,"and the farmers, so far fro m being",41
NA,garded as of no consequence to the city interest,41
NA,"workers, will be aided and supported, .as development.",41
NA,they-th e city workers-ar e absolutely,41
NA,-dependent on them for their meat supfor,41
NA,plies. I f we can increase the carryplace,41
NA,ing capacity of that district to which,41
NA,"I refer, and dry areas generally, leaving",41
NA,aside the question of making the land suittions.,41
NA,"able for agriculture, we should so increase",41
NA,our exports that i t would be a national,41
NA,benefit. There is a dry district on the,41
NA,"transcontinental railway route, between",41
NA,Adelaide and Albany. The rainfall there,41
NA,"is between 10 inches and 12 inches, and",41
NA,should be our endeavour to grow suitable,41
NA,"grasses there, and also a suitable wheat.",41
NA,I understand experiments are now being,41
NA,made in South A f r i ca with the-Durum,41
NA,"wheat, which is obtained from Italy , and",41
NA,they are trying to breed a wheat which,41
NA,will grow with practically none bufc,41
NA,conserved moisture.,41
Mr SHARPE ,Th e Beef Trust has,41
NA,"the land available there, and you know",41
Mr FALKINER , I f the honorable,41
NA,member is talking about South A f r i ca he,41
NA,"may or may not be correct, but i f",41

NA,ber of members of the Labour party,41
NA,in Western Australia own the bulk of,41
NA,"i t. However, there are millions of acres",41
NA,"of land there, and we need a wheat that",41
NA,will grow upon them. The State Dethe,41
NA,partment i n Victoria has recommended,41
NA,the pastoralists to grow saltbush i,41
NA,"dry districts, but saltbush bas a very light worker, who is dependent ou them.",41
NA,"carrying capacity, and will not carry",41
NA,many sheep as grass w i l l. The,41
NA,"Departments have not done anything i n cornia,",41
NA,regard to stock diseases. The Queensthey,41
NA,land Department has certainly done a hearty support.,41
NA,"little for fche tick trouble, but nothing",41
NA,new has been done i n regard to the,41
NA,"ordinary diseases of sheep, such as",41
NA,"rot, enlarged sheath i n male sheep, blowof",41
NA,"fly, and liver rot, things for wliich,",41
NA,"far, no cures have been discovered.",41
NA,stockowners had to rely on a private indicalled,41

NA,mously. I f we have a Federal Bureau,41

NA,with no hope of bettering their condi-,41

NA,the status of the agriculturists by apply-,41
NA,"ing science to their calling, and making",41
NA,"i t more productive, so thafc they may be",41
NA,"enabled to live lives of comfort, and have",41
NA,conveniences equal to those of city wor-,41
NA,"i t kers, and so that country life may be more",41
NA,"attractive to the young people who now,",41
NA,"in some instances, regard i t as a drudgery,",41
NA,"and, therefore, flock to the towns. We have",41
NA,now the benefit of telephones and motor-,41
NA,- cars. Every farmer should be i n the posi-,41
NA,"tion to be able to afford these things, so",41
NA,the that his life will be pleasant and at-,41
NA,"tractive, and, instead of people flock-",41
NA,"all ing to the towns, they will be content to",41

Mr KING OMALLEY ,Darwin),41

NA,"portant measure; but, i n the interests of",41
NA,"system and of organization, the Govern-",41
NA,enormeut oughfc not to carry i t into effect,41
NA,emuntil there has been a conference with the,41
Mr MATHEWS ,Tha t would be a waste,41
Mr KING OMALLEY , F o r tlie past,42
NA,thirteen years we have been wasting time,42
NA,by flouting the States. We have gained,42
NA,nothing by that.,42
Mr MATHEWS ,The y have flouted us.,42
Mr KING OMALLEY , T h e y were,42
NA,here first. The Commonwealth arose out,42
NA,"of the States, through their action i n",42
NA,voluntarily surrendering certain specified,42
NA,functions. A thing created ought not to,42
NA,persecute its creators. The Agricultura l,42
NA,Bureau of the United States of America,42
NA,"has done wonders, because the State",42
NA,authorities have worked i n conjunction,42
NA,with the Federal authorities.,42
NA,Washingtou and not to see the operations,42
NA,of that immense institution is not to see,42
NA,Washington at a l l. The Washington,42
NA,Agricultural Bureau enables the farmers,42
NA,"of America, by the co-operation of all the",42
NA,"States, to have soils investigated, to have",42
NA,"new kinds of plants and cereals created,",42
NA,to study the conditions oi the whole,42
NA,"earth, and to bring from all parts of the",42
NA,world the various kinds of growth that,42
NA,"are required, crossing them with other",42
NA,"growths already i n tlie' country, to i n -",42
NA,crease production. Let me give one Illus-,42
NA,tration : I n the State of Illinois they were,42
NA,producing about 15 bushels of wheat to,42
NA,the acre. Six counties i n the M u l t i -,42
NA,"nomer district joined together, and the",42
NA,United States Department sent out to,42
NA,"them a professor, who, crossing a wheat",42
NA,"brought from A f r i c a , or Siberia, with",42
NA,"an American wheat, in three years i n -",42
NA,creased the yield to 27 bushels an acre.,42
NA,"The crop grown on 200,000 acres is thus",42
NA,"increased by 12 bushels an acre, and, as",42
NA,wheat was worth 4s. 2d. a bushel i n,42
NA,"America then, the wealth of those six",42
NA,counties was increased,42
NA,"2,'o00,000 dols., or Â£500,000. That hap-",42
NA,pened i n districts where the land has been,42
NA,deteriorating through continuous crop-,42
NA,ping.,42
Mr RILEY , Did it make,42
NA,' cheaper to the consumers 1,42
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY -Eve n if i t,42
NA,"did not, i t enriched the neighbourhood,",42
NA,and gave more work. I believe that i f,42
NA,"the Government conferred with the States,",42
NA,they would willingly join to make their,42
NA,"bureaux part of the national bureau,",42
NA,working i n co-operation with i t . Eventu-,42
NA,ally we should i n this way establish one,42
NA,big institution. B u t i f we start with a,42
NA,"little instituton of our own, there w i l l",42
NA,"be overlapping, and various kinds of i n -",42
NA,"terference, until , at last, there will be a",42
NA,universal cry that our institution is not,42
NA,"wanted. Men can sit round a table, and",42
NA,"agree on certain things, but they soon",42
NA,get into diametrical opposition i f not,42
NA,asked to take part i n what is being done.,42
NA,The wonderful success of the Labour,42
NA,party is due to the fact that every mem-,42
NA,ber of i t has a voice i n the government,42
NA,of the country. I have never heard of,42
NA,any of our State bureaux finding a cure,42
NA,for the diseases which affect stock i n this,42
NA,country; but I well remember that when,42
NA,we used to send cattle across from the,42
NA,"Panhandle country, to ship them at",42
NA,"Kiawa, for Chicago, and pleuro-pneu-",42
NA,"To visit monia, and other diseases, broke out,",42
NA,scientific men were immediately sent down,42
NA,by the National Government to prescribe,42
NA,cures. This was done at the expense of,42
NA,the nation. We did not pay a penny f o r,42
NA,". i t . But, of course, the nation profited by",42
NA,"the industry. I f you had 20,000,000",42
NA,"head of cattle i n the Northern Territory,",42
NA,even though they were all owned by the,42
NA,"Beef Trust, they would create wealth f o r",42
NA,Australia. B u t I do not wish to talk out,42
NA,the B i l l . I hope that the Government,42
NA,"will confer with the States, and next ses-",42
NA,"sion establish a real institution ; that is,",42
NA,"unless, i n the meantime, there is a double",42
NA,"dissolution, and the present Ministry gets",42
NA,knocked out.,42
Mr GROOM ,Darling Downs-Min -,42
NA,"ister of Trade and Customs) [8.25],-Thi s",42
NA,is a measure that I have very deeply at,42
NA,"""heart. Early i n the history of Federa-",42
NA,"tion, I was associated with one",42
NA,who was deeply interested i n tryin g to,42
NA,get Parliament to take up a scheme of,42
NA,this kind. The powers of the Federa-,42
NA,tion were intended to assist those en-,42
NA,by nearly,42
NA,gaged i n primary production as much as,42
NA,any other class i n the community. Aus-,42
NA,"tralia depends, to a very great ex-",42
NA,"tent, for its prosperity on the pro-",42
NA,ductions of animal and plant life. In,42
NA,"wheat 1911, our agricultural output was worth",42
NA,"Â£38,774,000; our pastoral output,",42
NA,"Â£50,725,000; dairy, poultry, &c,",42
NA,"Â£19,107,000; forestry, & c , Â£5,728,000;",42
NA,"a total of Â£114,334,000. That was the",42
NA,contribution of. the animal and plant life,42
NA,of Australia to our material prosperity.,42
NA,I t is upon the prosperity of our primary,42
NA,production that our secondary industries,42
NA,exist. For the f u l l development of a,42
NA,"nation, you must have primary and",42
NA,secondary industries side by side. I t is,42
NA,by the establishment of the secondary i n -,42
NA,dustries in the cities that you produce the,42
NA,"skilled artisans, whose presence is evidence",42
NA,of a very high state of civilization. B u t,43
NA,the foundation of our national prosperity,43
NA,must be our primary industries.,43
NA,"have to consider, first, how we are to",43
NA,"preserve what we have, and, secondly,",43
NA,how we are to increase our output. A t,43
NA,the basis of this B i l l is the desire to,43
NA,preserve what we have i n the plant and,43
NA,animal life of Australia. We propose to,43
NA,establish a Bureau of Agriculture whose,43
NA,primary object will be research and the,43
NA,scientific investigation of the diseases,43
NA,which affect our animal and plant life.,43
NA,We have already taken action through the,43
NA,Quarantine Department to keep out of,43
NA,Australia many of the diseases which are,43
NA,to be found in other parts of the world.,43
NA,That i n many countries is part of the,43
NA,work of an agricultural bureau.,43
NA,have also a Commonwealth Meteorological,43
NA,"Department, and, i n the United States of",43
NA,"America, meteorology is part of the work",43
NA,"of the Agricultural Bureau. Thus, we",43
NA,have already made a start. As regards,43
NA,"the investigation of diseases, that is being",43
NA,asked for by persons i n nearly every part,43
NA,of Australia. When the honorable mem-,43
NA,"ber for Eden-Monaro was Minister, I",43
NA,visited with him the sugar-cane growing,43
NA,"districts of Queensland, where we were i n -",43
NA,formed of a pest that diminished the,43
NA,cane crops. The Minister was asked to,43
NA,put money on the Estimates for its i n -,43
NA,vestigation with a view to prevention.,43
NA,That pest alone has cost the sugar i n -,43
NA,dustry thousands of pounds.,43
NA,"toria, the fruit-growers asked for the i n -",43
NA,vestigation of the disease known as bitter,43
NA,"pit, and my predecessor i n office, by co-",43
NA,"operation with the States, appointed Mr .",43
NA,MCAlpine to conduct investigations. Some,43
NA,very high tributes have been paid by per-,43
NA,sons outside Australia to the work that he,43
NA,"has done. For instance, the consulting",43
NA,agriculturalist i n the United States of,43
NA,America says this of his work-,43
NA,I secured the loan of a copy of your Handbook,43
NA,"of Fungus Diseases of the Potato in Australia,",43
NA,"perused it carefully, and find it to be the best",43
NA,treatise on the diseases of potatoes I have,43
NA,seen.,43
NA,W i t h regard to his progress report on,43
NA,"pit, Professor White, of the New Yor k State",43
NA,"College of Agriculture, said, "" I have",43
NA,gone through this pretty carefully; i t,43
NA,certainly the best contribution we have,43
NA,"yet to date."" I have only quoted a",43
NA,of the -many opinions about this gentlemunicated,43
NA,man's work. Those are the opinions,43
NA,men capable of speaking and judging on,43
NA,the work of this scientist whom we have,43
NA,"working i n Australia, and of whose excel-",43
NA,lent work we may well be proud. Excel-,43
NA,"We lent as his work is, yet what Professor",43
NA,MCAlpine is doing is only a small contribu-,43
NA,tion to the great work that has yet to be,43
NA,done. The States have done splendid,43
NA,"work, but so far have not been able to",43
NA,take up the work on an adequate,43
NA,"scale. For instance, Queensland covers",43
NA,an enormous area. We have the pos-,43
NA,sibility of all sorts of diseases spring-,43
NA,ing up through all the industries i n,43
NA,that State ancl going across into New,43
NA,South Wales. I t would be infinitely bet-,43
NA,ter for Australia to get three or four,43
NA,highly-paid scientists to make a thorough,43
NA,"investigation of these questions, and re-",43
NA,We port for Australia as a whole.,43
Mr SHARPE ,Yo u have not provided,43
NA,for that i n this B i l l .,43
Mr GROOM , I am afraid the hon-,43
NA,orable member has not read the B i l l .,43
NA,"That is the intention, as the B i l l says dis-",43
NA,"tinctly, "" the investigation of pests and",43
NA,"diseases affecting animals, plant l i f e , "" and",43
NA,so on. We have many of these arising,43
NA,throughout Australia. The idea of this,43
NA,B i l l is not to supersede or do away with,43
NA,the existing State Agricultura l Depart-,43
NA,ments. You can divide the work being,43
NA,done by those Departments into three or,43
NA,four different functions. There is the,43
NA,"administrative work, educational work,",43
NA,"I n Vicexperimental work, and research work.",43
NA,A great deal of the administrative work,43
NA,will have to be continued to be done by,43
NA,"the States, such as appointing inspectors",43
NA,of orchards and stock. The educational,43
NA,work will continue to be done by them,43
NA,through their agricultural colleges aud,43
NA,high schools. The experimental work re-,43
NA,ferred to must also remain with them to a,43
NA,"great extent, as they have their experi-",43
NA,mental farms. I have had prepared by,43
NA,"the Commonwealth Statistician, for the",43
NA,"information of honorable members, a com-",43
NA,"plete chart, showing tlie whole scope of",43
NA,"ever the different Departments of Agriculture,",43
NA,"what they are doing, and the different",43
NA,bitter measures prepared by them. I t shows at,43
NA,"a glance the whole of the work"" that is be-",43
NA,ing covered i n Australia at present. The,43
NA,"is research work, to a great extent, can be",43
NA,usefully done by the Commonwealth A g r i -,43
NA,few cultural Bureau. Some time ago I com-,43
NA,"with Queensland, and the",43
NA,of Acting Premier of Queensland replied-,43
NA,I have received a long report from the De-,43
NA,partment of my colleague the Secretary for,43
NA,"Agriculture, the last paragraph of which I ap-",44
NA,"pend hereto, and in which I f u l l y concur :-",44
NA,""" The Minister .desires that the Commonwealth",44
NA,Government be informed that i f the Bureau is,44
NA,"established, this Department, recognising that it",44
NA,"will be for tbe common good, will be prepared",44
NA,in every way to full y co-operate in any work,44
NA,"that lies within its sphere, in which this De-",44
NA,"partment may be able to help.""",44
NA,"Mr Swinburne, speaking on behalf of",44
NA,"Victoria, pointed out that the Common-",44
NA,wealth-,44
NA,could with advantage confine its attention to,44
NA,research rather than administrative work. At,44
NA,present each of the States maintained a staff of,44
NA,experts to conduct research work. These experts,44
NA,"included entomologists, vegetable pathologists,",44
NA,"and veterinary officers, who were inquiring into",44
NA,many problems of vital importance to the pro-,44
NA,ducers of Australia. Among these problems,44
NA,"were rust in wheat, bitter-pit in -apples, and",44
NA,"stock diseases, for which no scientifically-based",44
NA,cure had yet been found. Were the Common-,44
NA,wealth to assume control of this work much,44
NA,good could be done. Instead of half-a-dozen,44
NA,States working for the same ends along dif-,44
NA,"ferent lines with expensive staffs, the Common-",44
NA,wealth would be able to co-ordinate the work,44
NA,and secure for its advancement the very best,44
NA,scientific and practical experts that the world,44
NA,offered. The bureau could be maintained by,44
NA,contributions from the States and the Federal,44
NA,"Government, and its establishment would open",44
NA,up a new era in production.,44
NA,T h a t was i n 1908. W h e n the Scottish,44
NA,"Commissioners came out, t h e y i n q u i r e d",44
NA,i n t o our a g r i c u l t u r a l conditions and edu-,44

NA,"Bureaux. I n t h e i r r e p o r t , a t page 172,",44
NA,they stated-,44
NA,A strong and well-equinned Federal Depart-,44
NA,ment would be more likely to cope with such,44
NA,diseases than the weaker and less well-equipped,44
NA,Departments of the States.,44
NA,problems' which are common to the whole of Aus-,44
NA,"tralia, or to the greater part of it, and it would",44
NA,appear that time and money would be saved by,44
NA,placing some of the work of research in the,44
NA,bands of the Federal Department.,44
NA,This B i l l is not intended to unnecessarily,44
NA,duplicate the work that is being done.,44
NA,I t would be the duty of the Pederal De-,44
NA,partment to work w i t h the States i n every,44
NA,"way possible, carrying out experiments",44
NA,and investigations all over Australia.,44
Mr SAMPSON ,Wil l i t mean a reduc-,44
NA,tion of State expenditure?,44
Mr GROOM ,Th e States w i l l have,44
NA,"to be consulted, as"" they should be.",44
NA,"believe they w i l l be able to assist, and",44
NA,-,44
NA,"when we get into practical operation, we",44
NA,shall find i t to our benefit to take advan-,44
NA,tage of the Australian universities also.,44
NA,"I asked Professor H . A . Woodruff, of the",44
NA,Veterinary School of the Melbourne U n i -,44
NA,"versity, to tell me to what extent scientific",44
NA,research work is being carried out in Mel-,44
NA,"bourne, and he wrote as follows-",44
NA,The original research which is being carried,44
NA,out at this school has reference to two diseases,44
NA,"of considerable economic importance, namely",44
NA,contagious pleuro-pneumonia of cattle and bovioe,44
NA,contagious abortion.,44
NA,The former is of particular importance in con-,44
NA,"nexion with the export of any ""live stock from",44
NA,Australia. The latter is chiefly of interest be-,44
NA,cause of the great loss it entails to dairymen.,44
NA,What is being attempted is to discover more,44
NA,"exact methods of diagnosis, and then, subse-",44
NA,"quently, improved methods of immunization.",44
NA,The scope of this work is necessarily limited,44
NA,by the fact that the staff is engaged primarily,44
NA,in teaching work. For special research it would,44
NA,be necessary to retain one or more skilled per-,44
NA,"sons to do nothing else, and little extra in equip-",44
NA,ment would be required. Experimental animals,44
NA,would from time to time have to be procured.,44
NA,.The two items requiring money are (i) the,44
NA,"salaries of the men set apart for the work, and",44
NA,(2) purchase of experimental animals.,44
NA,. I t appears to me that the best and most,44
NA,economical method of conducting pathological,44
NA,research is to appoint the most suitable person,44
NA,available for a stated period to investigate the,44
NA,"particular problem in hand, and not -to create",44
NA,a permanent staff.,44
NA,"The work of this school is fairly well defined,",44
NA,and in so far as investigations were on a large,44
NA,scale and called for by the Federal authorities,44
NA,(Agricultural Department) that special staff and,44
NA,extra cost would have to be met from Federal,44
NA,sources.,44
NA,"So far as I am personally concerned, every",44
NA,effort would be made to co-operate. No doubt,44
NA,you would be able to secure the consent of the,44
NA,u r a l Victorian Government to any necessary arrange-,44
NA,ment.,44
NA,"I think Australia will find, as the",44
NA,"United States of America has found,",44
NA,that i t will be a benefit for us to take,44
NA,advantage qf the work of the scientists,44
NA,There are many wherever they are throughout Australia.,44
NA,I t may be necessary to subsidize and assist,44
NA,"them, so t h at our experiments may be car-",44
NA,ried out on as wide aud extensive a scale,44
NA,as possible. I want particularly to em-,44
NA,phasize the fact that the scope of this B i l l,44
NA,is not intended to supersede the State De-,44
NA,"partments at all, but is to undertake a",44
NA,big branch of work that is absolutely vital,44
NA,to Australia's production. I believe that,44
NA,"if this B i l l is carried, we shall have the",44
NA,same experience as the honorable member,44
NA,for Darwin said that the United States',44
NA,Department has had. Many discoveries,44
NA,have been made i n the United States of,44
NA,I,44
NA,"America, the results of which have been",44
NA,to save more money to the producers than,44
NA,would pay for the cost of the equipment,44
NA,of the whole of the Department for years.,44
NA,The appointment of scientists is not a,44
NA,mere useless expenditure. Scientific i n -,45
NA,"vestigation has to be made, and althougn",45
NA,the first stage may appear to produce no,45
NA,"material advantage, experience has shown",45
NA,that i n the long r u n the result has,45
NA,been greatly to the benefit of the pro-,45
NA,ducers i n the country concerned. Science,45
NA,is coming more and more into play i n,45
NA,every department of life. Agriculture is,45
NA,"one of the oldest callings i n the world,",45
NA,and yet no calling is so dependent upon,45
NA,every advance and discovery i n science.,45
NA,Every latest discovery is being turned in,45
NA,some way to the improvement of agricul-,45
NA,ture. The two great problems before us,45
NA,are to cheapen the cost of production and,45
NA,to increase the output. I f we take ad-,45
NA,vantage of scieuce to increase the produc-,45
NA,"tion of material wealth i n Australia, the",45
NA,"national wealth will increase, the higher",45
NA,standards of civilization that we desire,45
NA,to see throughout Australia will be made,45
NA,"possible, and the fuller development of a",45
NA,greater Australia will be realized.,45
Mr SHARPE ,Oxley) [8.40] - I am,45
NA,sorry I have not heard all the speeches,45
NA,of houorable members representing the,45
NA,agricultural portions ol the Common-,45
NA,"wealth, but I havo had the pleasure of",45
NA,"hearing one speech to-night, and am not",45
NA,too well pleased with the effort that the,45
NA,honorable member made to convince the,45
NA,Chamber that he was i n favour of the,45
NA,B i l l . The measure is of serious import-,45
NA,"ance to the people, undoubtedly the most",45
NA,"serious introduced this session, yet i t is",45
NA,only brought forward at the eleventh,45
NA,"hour, and the Government are handling",45
NA,i t without auy serious consideration.,45
Mr FLEMING , I t was the first B i,45
NA,brought i n .,45
Mr SHARPE , I t is the more dis-,45
NA,credit to the Government and their sup-,45
NA,porters that they allow i t to be the last,45
NA,measure dealt with. I f they had been,45
NA,"sincere about i t , and desirous of seeing i t",45
NA,"become law this session, we should, i n",45
NA,"all probability, have allowed them to pass",45
NA,"i t , and given them our assistance to do",45
NA,so.,45
Mr RODGERS ,Yo u are going to do i t,45
NA,"now, are you not?",45
Mr SHARPE ,W e are not going to,45
NA,"do i t now, because the hour is too late,",45
NA,and the provisions of the Bil l are not suffi-,45
NA,cient to satisfy honorable members on this,45
NA,side. Honorable members opposite are,45
NA,not sincere i n their effort to bring i t into,45
NA,operation i n order to improve the condi-,45
NA,tions of the men on the land.,45
NA,[165],45
Mr GROOM ,Ar e you opposed to the,45
NA,Bill!,45
Mr SHARPE , I am i n favour of i t ;,45
NA,but I am not i n favour of i t being rushed,45
NA,through in its present form.,45
Mr GROOM ,Ho w do you think i t,45
NA,ought to be altered?,45
Mr SHARPE ,W e should have some,45
NA,opportunity to discuss the Bill and know,45
NA,its principles. The man on the land de-,45
NA,sires more opportunity to improve his con-,45
NA,dition ; but this Bill will not help i n that,45
NA,direction. We are told by honorable,45
NA,members opposite that many people in,45
NA,different parts of the world grow three or,45
NA,four times the amount of produce on their,45
NA,"land that we can grow here, because they",45
NA,"have a proper analysis made of their soil,",45
NA,with the assistance of their Governments.,45
Mr FALKINER ,Wher e is this?,45
Mr SHARPE ,"Germany , Switzer-",45
NA,"land, Holland, and France. The men",45
NA,who came into this Parliament as cham-,45
NA,"pions of the farmers, have remained silent",45
NA,so f a r as this B i l l is concerned. They,45
NA,have not raised their voices i n favour of,45
NA,the farmers.,45
Sir ROBERT BEST , Wha t suggestions,45
NA,does the honorable member rr.akeT,45
Mr SHARPE , I think that the B i l l,45
NA,should be drafted . on more liberal lines.,45
NA,Provision should be made for the analy-,45
NA,sis of soils and the teaching of farmers,45
NA,as to the crops for which their lands are,45
NA,most suited.,45
Mr RODGERS ,Rea d the B i l l .,45
Mr SHARPE , I t would be idle to,45
NA,read i t at this hour. I know that tbe,45
NA,Government are not sincere i n bringing,45
NA,l l i t down. I f they were they would tell as,45
NA,what i t is going to cost the country.,45
Mr SPEAKER ,Th e honorable mem-,45
NA,ber must not impute insincere motives,45
NA,to the Government.,45
Mr FLEMING ,Surel y the Government,45
NA,have not placed on the Estimates merely,45
NA,"for f u n an item of Â£5,000 i n connexion",45
NA,with this Bureau.,45
NA,Mr SHARPE . ^ - T h at amount should,45
NA,be expended i n carrying on the work of,45
NA,the Bureau. Of the new members sup-,45
NA,"porting the Government, only two or",45
NA,three representing rural districts havead-,45
NA,"dressed themselves to this question, al-",45
NA,though when they were before the people,45
NA,they were all most emphatic i n their de-,45
NA,clarations that they intended to do much,45
NA,to bring about improved conditions f o r,45
NA,the man on the land. This B i l l should,45
NA,have been brought down earlier i n fei\*Â»,45
NA,session. The Opposition are most anxious,46
NA,to improve the conditions of the man on,46
NA,"the land, and we feel that a B i l l of this",46
NA,"character, i f drafted on broad lines, must",46
NA,tend to help them considerably. We have,46
NA,been told that the Scottish Commis-,46
NA,"sioners, who visited Australia recently,",46
NA,were not altogether pleased with their,46
NA,"trip to Queensland, because they found",46
NA,that all the most suitable laud had al-,46
NA,ready been taken up. As a matter of,46
NA,"fact, we> have i n Queensland vast areas",46
NA,that could be put to a more profitable use,46
NA,than that to which they are at present,46
NA,devoted. I cannot vote for the B i l l i n its,46
NA,present form.,46
Mr GROOM ,Le t us get into Com-,46
NA,"mittee, and the Government will be pre-",46
NA,pared to consider any reasonable amend-,46
NA,ment that the honorable member may,46
NA,propose.,46
Mr SHARPE , I f the Government,46
NA,"will accept certain suggestions, which I",46
NA,"think will tend to improve the B i l l , then",46
NA,I shall be prepared to let the second read-,46
NA,ing go. A few years ago Sir Hector Car-,46
NA,"ruthers, when Minister of Lands i n New",46
NA,"South Wales, decided to institute a most",46
NA,"rigid inspection of dairy cattle, and the",46
NA,result of that inspection was that probably,46
NA,nearly one-half of the dairy cattle of the,46
NA,State were condemned.,46
Mr FLEMING ,Nothin g like one-half.,46
Mr SHARPE ,Th e honorable mem-,46
NA,ber knows nothing about the matter. I,46
NA,"can speak from experience, because I was",46
NA,living at the time i n a dairying district.,46
Mr FLEMING , A n d I was represent-,46
NA,ing a dairying district i n the New South,46
NA,Wales Parliament.,46
Mr SHARPE ,Th e dairymen of the,46
NA,State were greatly incensed at this action,46
NA,"on the part of the Government, and shortly",46
NA,afterwards the system was dropped. Since,46
NA,"then, however, dairymen i n the South",46
NA,"Coast district, fro m which Sydney draws",46
NA,"its milk supplies, have expressed their",46
NA,regret that the inspection was not con-,46
NA,"tinued, f o r i f i t had been they believe",46
NA,that there would have been healthier and,46
NA,more profitable dairy herds i n the coun-,46
NA,"try. Do the Government propose, under",46
NA,"this B i l l , to provide for the inspection of",46
NA,stock? They occupy tbeir present posi-,46
NA,"tion only temporarily, and we must take",46
NA,"them for what they are worth, but i f this",46
NA,"Bill be not passed this session, they wil l",46
NA,probably tell the people that i t was i m -,46
NA,"possible to pass i t , owing to the opposi-",46
NA,tion of the Labour party.,46
Mr TUDOR ,Member s of their own,46
NA,"party have "" stone-walled "" i t .",46
Mr SHARPE , I am prepared to,46
NA,meet whatever criticism they may indulge,46
NA,"in. wi\ h regard to our attitude, and since",46
NA,the Minister of Trade and Customs has,46
NA,promised to give us an opportunity to,46
NA,"move amendments i n Committee, I shall",46
NA,not further detain the House.,46
Mr ARTHUR ,Bendigo) [8.57] -I t is,46
NA,not my intention to detain the House by,46
NA,entering upon a discussion of the general,46
NA,"merits of this B i l l , since I believe that",46
NA,fchey are well recognised. Nearly every,46
NA,member of every party who has sat i n,46
NA,this House has afc one time or another ex-,46
NA,"pressed his approval of the proposal, and",46
NA,if i t were for no other reason than that,46
NA,i t will extend i n some degree the activi-,46
NA,ties of the Commonwealth into an area,46
NA,"where beneficial results must be achieved,",46
NA,I should give the B i l l my support. This,46
NA,question came before the House as far,46
NA,"back as 1901, when the ex-member for",46
NA,Bendigo moved-,46
NA,"That, in the opinion of this House, a National",46
NA,Department of Agriculture and Productive I n-,46
NA,"dustries, on the same lines as that of the United",46
NA,"States of America, ought to be organized and",46
NA,maintained in connexion with the Government of,46
NA,the Commonwealth.,46
Mr TUDOR ,Tha t was one of the first,46
NA,motions to be submitted i n this Parlia-,46
NA,ment by a private member.,46
Mr ARTHUR ," T h a t is so, and I",46
NA,find that i t was supported by the greater,46
NA,part of the talent of the House..,46
NA,"I f i t were necessary, I would refer hon-",46
NA,orable members t o the very elaborate,46
NA,memorandum on the proposed Australian,46
NA,Bureau of Agriculture which was pre-,46
NA,pared by the present Minister of Trade,46
NA,and Customs when he was Attorney-,46
NA,General i n 1908. I t will benefit hon-,46
NA,orable members i f they read that,46
NA,"document, and consider i n detail all the",46
NA,ramifications of the matter. R u t what I,46
NA,wish particularly to refer to is the ques-,46
NA,tion of the constitutionality of the B i l l .,46
NA,I have not come to any conclusion on the,46
NA,"point, but a great number of doubts have",46
NA,been raised by constitutional authorities as,46
NA,to the power of the Commonwealth to ap-,46
NA,propriate money f o r anypurposes other,46
NA,"than those mentioned i n section 51, which",46
NA,specifies the powers that may be exercised,46
NA,"by the Commonwealth. I n that section,",46
NA,there is no reference whatever to encour-,46
NA,"aging or fostering agriculture, or any-",46
NA,"thing of the sort, and therefore i t is a",46
NA,question whether the Commonwealth can,46
NA,"spend money for the purposes of this B i l l ,",47
NA,or any purpose not there mentioned.,47
Sir ROBERT BEST ,Th e,47
NA,member does not think that as a lawyer?,47
Mr ARTHUR , Mr Speaker just now,47
NA,-called an honorable member to order for,47
NA,"imputing motives of insincerity, and I",47
NA,think that the honorable member for Kooconstitutional,47
NA,yong is imputing such motives to myself.,47
NA,I ask that the honorable member shall,47
NA,withdraw the words.,47
Mr SPEAKER , I ask the honorable,47
NA,member for Kooyong to withdraw the,47
NA,words complained of.,47
Sir ROBERT BEST ," I f the honorable welfare"" of the Commonwealth.",47
NA,"member is serious, I shall, of course,",47
NA,withdraw the words.,47
Mr SPEAKER , I took the remark,47
NA,being merely jocular.,47
Sir ROBERT BEST , O f course i t was.,47
Mr SPEAKER ," I f , however,",47
NA,words are regarded as offensive by the,47
NA,"honorable member for Bendigo, they must",47
NA,be withdrawn.,47
Sir ROBERT BEST ,"Certainly ,",47
NA,"Speaker, I withdraw them.",47
Mr ARTHUR ,Perhap s I made too,47
NA,much of the honorable member's jocular,47
NA,remark. I n support of the view I,47
NA,indicating rather than expressing any,47
NA,support of- a probable view fora constiin,47
NA,tutional lawyer to take- I may say that,47
NA,"Mr Justice Higgins, when a member of",47
NA,"this House, expressed one exactly similar",47
NA,in 1903. He was then dealing w i th,47
NA,"Naval Agreement B i l l , which was somedo",47
NA,thing outside the ordinary purposes of,47
NA,fence as laid down i n the expressed powers,47
NA,of section 51. When Mr Justice H i,47
NA,"gins was speaking, Mr Deakin said-",47
NA,The honorable and learned member's argument,47
NA,implies that the power to make appropriations,47
NA,is limited by the legislative powers conferred,47
NA,by section 51.,47
NA,Mr Higgins -Yes . Under the States Constinot,47
NA,"tutions, very much wider powers are conferred,",47
NA,"and so on. We know, as a matter of fact,",47
NA,that the United States of America,47
NA,tablished a National Bureau of Agricul-,47
NA,"ture, but the powers under the United extent",47
NA,States Constitution are very much wider,47
NA,than our own i n this respect. Congress is,47
NA,"given expressed power to spend money wealth.""",47
NA,"for the purposes of the ""general welof",47
NA,"fare."" On anything that may be conof",47
NA,"sidered for the general welfare, the branch",47
NA,United States Government may spend extend,47
NA,"money, but our Constitution, as I say, is general",47
NA,much more limited. Section 81 of our taxation,47
NA,Constitution says-,47
NA,A l l revenues or moneys raised or received by,47
NA,-he Executive Government of the Common-,47
NA,[105]- 2,47
NA,wealth shall form one consolidated revenue,47
NA,"fund, to be appropriated for. the purposes of the",47
NA,Commonwealth in the manner and subject to,47
NA,honorable the charges and liabilities imposed by this Con-,47
NA,stitution.,47
NA,That that excludes any appropriation of,47
NA,"this kind is borne out, I think, by sound",47
NA,reason. I f we are able to,47
NA,"spend money for this purpose, we are able",47
NA,to spend money for any other purpose,47
NA,"which seems good to us-tha t is, i f our",47
NA,"power of spending money for the "" pur-",47
NA,"poses of the Commonwealth "" is equiva-",47
NA,"lent to spending money for the "" general",47
NA,We,47
NA,"may, from this point of view, spend the",47
NA,m'oneys raised by taxation for any pur-,47
NA,"as poses we choose, and i t is the doubt i n",47
NA,that regard that I desire to express. Can,47
NA,this be done? Can we spend the money,47
NA,"the we raise for any purpose, whether that",47
NA,"purpose is, or is not, outside the scope of",47
NA,our legislative powers? Professor Har-,47
NA,"rison Moore, i n his Commonwealth of Aus-",47
NA,"Mr tralia, which is well known to many hon-",47
NA,"orable members, deals with this subject;",47
NA,and i f the honorable member for Koo-,47
NA,"yong, who is also a lawyer, will",47
NA,"am read what is said by the Professor,",47
NA,he will see that there is some substance,47
NA,the position X present. I personally,47
NA,"hope there is no substance i n i t , because",47
NA,"I desire this B i l l to go through, regarding",47
NA,"i t , as I do, as a measure which will prove",47
NA,the of benefit to the Commonwealth. But we,47
NA,not desire to pass such legislation i f,47
NA,"dethere is any doubt, without having that",47
NA,doubt expressed and considered by the,47
NA,gHouse. I t is for that purpose only I rose,47
NA,to make this contribution to the debate.,47
Mr AHERN ,Whic h way is the honor-,47
NA,able member going to advise us?,47
Mr ARTHUR ," U n f o r t u n a t e l y , i t is",47
NA,"my function, but that of the A t t o r-",47
NA,"ney-General, to advise the House on such",47
NA,"matters. A t page 523 of his book, Pro-",47
NA,has esfessor Harrison Moore says-,47
NA,A very important question arises as to the,47
NA,of the power of appropriation. By sec-,47
NA,"tion 81, the Consolidated Revenue Fund is "" to",47
NA,be appropriated for the purposes of the Common-,47
NA,Unquestionably the Commonwealth,47
NA,may appropriate money for the maintenance,47
NA,its Government and for the execution of any,47
NA,the objects which have been committed to any,47
NA,of it. Does the power of appropriation,47
NA,"beyond this so that the Parliament, hav-",47
NA,"ing a general power of taxation, has an equally",47
NA,power to extend the proceeds of that,47
NA,as it thinks fit without regard to whether,47
NA,the object of expenditure is for the purpose of,47
NA,an incident to some matter which belongs to the,47
NA,Federal Government?,47
NA,"That is the question he puts, and he goes",48
NA,on to say-,48
NA,"In the United States, after keen controversy,",48
NA,"it is now agreed that "" the power of Congress",48
NA,"over the Treasury is, in effect, absolute, and",48
NA,extends to the appropriation of money for any,48
NA,object which in their judgment will conduce,48
NA,to the defence of the country or promote its,48
NA,"welfare."" This, however, is under an express",48
NA,"power to "" provide for the general welfare.""",48
NA,Professor Harrison Moore deals with a,48
NA,"similar position i n Canada, which has also",48
NA,"expressed powers, and on the following",48
NA,page he says-,48
NA,"There is, moreover, what appears a vital dis-",48
NA,tinction between the United States and the Com-,48
NA,"monwealth Constitutions in that, in the former,",48
NA,the proceeds of taxation are the unqualified pro-,48
NA,"perty of the Federal Government, subject to no",48
NA,claim by any one else.,48
NA,Professor Harrison Moore points out that,48
NA,in our Constitution there is a claim which,48
NA,the States may have on the surplus re-,48
NA,"venue, and that, therefore, there is some-",48
NA,"body, or there was before the Financial",48
NA,"Agreement came into operation, who",48
NA,could make a claim i f tbe money were,48
NA,spent for purposes other than those speci-,48
NA,fied i n the Constitution.,48
Mr AHERN ,Wa s that claim not dissi-,48
NA,pated by the Financial Agreement?,48
Mr ARTHUR ,Professo r Harrison,48
NA,"Moore says that the claim might go, but",48
NA,that does not affect the construction.,48
NA,"The Constitution must be construed,",48
NA,not by future events-no t by things,48
NA,which happen afterwards-bu t by the,48
NA,document as i t stood originally.,48
NA,the Constitution we have the fact that,48
NA,"the States can claim the surplus revenue,",48
NA,"and, therefore, they have",48
NA,say whether the Commonwealth shall,48
NA,spend its money on this or that thing.,48
NA,Professor Moore points out a further fact,48
NA,that is important. I f honorable members,48
NA,"will look at section 51, they w i ll see",48
NA,there are all sorts of directions as to,48
NA,ways i n which the moneys may be spent.,48
NA,I f the Commonwealth has power to,48
NA,"in any direction i t pleases, what object",48
NA,was there i n placing i n the Constitution,48
NA,those particular directions? Honorable,48
NA,members w i l l remember that there,48
NA,power to give bounties; and there would,48
NA,"be no necessity for that, i f the CommonAttorney-General",48
NA,"wealth has power to spend for any purnamely,",48
NA,poses i t chooses.,48
Mr GROOM ,Coul d we not spend money,48
NA,in connexion with quarantinable diseases,48
NA,affecting animals and plants?,48
Mr ARTHUR , T h a t would probably,48
NA,come under the power relating to quaran-,48
NA,tine.,48
Mr GROOM ,Th e proposed appropria-,48
NA,tion is one for the investigation of those,48
NA,diseases.,48
Mr ARTHUR , I am speaking of the,48
NA,general position. The Commonwealth is,48
NA,"taking up a position which, I hope, i t cat*",48
NA,"take u p ; and I hope that, i f i t has the",48
NA,"power, that the power w i l l be exercised.",48
Mr GLYNN ,Thi s was discussed at,48
NA,"great length last session, and we thought",48
NA,we had the power.,48
Mr ARTHUR , T h a t was for another,48
NA,"purpose altogether, namely, the mater-",48
NA,nity allowance.,48
Mr GLYNN , B u t the points that would,48
NA,* guide us now were taken into considera-,48
NA,tion.,48
Mr GROOM ,Th e maternity bonus goes,48
NA,"all to pieces i f the honorable member's,",48
NA,contention is correct.,48
Mr ARTHUR ,Honorabl e members,48
NA,"who were then i u Opposition, bufc a,re now",48
NA,"on the Government side, apparently had",48
NA,not the courage to tackle this important,48
NA,point.,48
Mr GROOM , I can assure the honor-,48
NA,able member that there was courage here,48
NA,even before he came into the House.,48
Mr ARTHUR , T h e opposition to the,48
NA,maternity allowance on this ground was,48
NA,"not, I think, pressed with any great eager-",48
NA,ness.,48
Mr GLYNN , I was one of the then,48
NA,Opposition who supported the conten-,48
NA,A n d i n tion that we had the power.,48
Mr ARTHUR , T h e point is whether,48
NA,i t is right or wrong to appropriate money,48
NA,some power to for such a purpose.,48
Mr GROOM ,Th e honorable member,48
NA,is questioning the whole power of ap-,48
NA,propriation except fbr specified objects.,48
Mr ARTHUR , I am questioning the,48
NA,that power to appropriate moneys for any pur-,48
NA,the poses other than those specified i n section,48
NA,51 and purposes incidental thereto. The,48
NA,spend Minister of Trade and Customs appre-,48
NA,"hends the position, because, i u his memo-",48
NA,"randum, he deals with i t most elaborately",48
NA,and f u l l y . On page 7 of that report we,48
NA,"is find, if I may say so, the error which I",48
NA,"conceive the honorable gentleman, as the",48
NA,"of that day, fell into,",48
NA,he did not discriminate between-,48
NA,the powers expressed i n the Constitution,48
NA,of the United States of America and those,48
NA,expressed i n fche Constitution of Aus-,48
NA,tralia.,48
Mr GROOM , I think the honorable,49
NA,member will find that I rested my argu-,49
NA,ment on the combined effect of all the,49
NA,expressed powers.,49
Mr ARTHUR , T h e honorable gentle-,49
NA,man went on to deal with tlie matter from,49
NA,another point of view. He dealt with i t,49
NA,first by way of analogy between the Aus-,49
NA,tralian Constitution and that of the,49
NA,"United States of America,-' and, appa-",49
NA,"rently, found the analogy perfect.",49
NA,then went on to deal with i t from the,49
NA,"point of view of the expressed powers, and",49
NA,he says-,49
NA,"Moreover, the power to organize such a de-",49
NA,partment is incidental to the grant of the various,49
NA,specific powers under the Constitution. Under,49
NA,section 51. sub-section (<)> Parliament under its,49
NA,powers of trade and commerce may appoint,49
NA,officers to inspect both imports and exports of,49
NA,agricultural products and stock.,49
NA,How can that power apply to the scope of,49
NA,this Bill?,49
Mr GROOM ,Ther e is. the combined,49
NA,effect.,49
Mr ARTHUR , I will take the powers,49
NA,"piecemeal, and then see whether taking",49
NA,them i n conjunction carries them any f u r -,49
NA,ther. The power as to the exports and,49
NA,"imports does not assist us, for that does",49
NA,-not refer to the general encouragement of,49
NA,the agricultural production of the Com-,49
NA,monwealth. The next mentioned is the,49
NA,power to grant bounties on the production,49
NA,or export of goods-t o grant bounties to,49
NA,encourage persons to produce a certain,49
NA,Â«lass of commodity. That i n no wise,49
NA,-carries the general power to spend money,49
NA,on the general encouragement of agricul-,49
NA,ture; because this alone indicates the ex-,49
NA,Xcnt to which the Commonwealth is given,49
NA,power to encourage agriculture. The,49
NA,-Commonwealth is given power to en-,49
NA,"-courage agriculture by granting bounties,",49
NA,"and that, i n itself, indicates that the",49
NA,.general power to encourage is not given.,49
NA,The Minister of Trade and Customs knows,49
NA,tliat one of the most important principles,49
NA,in the construction of a document is that,49
NA,"""the expression of one thing excludes the",49
NA,implication of another. The Minister of,49
NA,Trade and Customs goes on to deal with,49
NA,"the question of quarantine, and the ap-",49
NA,pointment of officers connected therewith.,49
NA,These are the only powers he mentions.,49
NA,"Standing alone, they would ""not include",49
NA,"'this power, and, in conjunction, I sub-",49
NA,"mit, they do not give i t , and therefore the",49
NA,matter is one that should be taken into,49
NA,consideration. I am not' raising this,49
NA,doubt in order to oppose the B i l l .,49
NA,merely wish to point out that we must be,49
NA,extremely careful.,49
Mr GROOM ,Thes e doubts were con-,49
NA,sidered by Sir John Quick and by Mr .,49
NA,Justice Isaacs also.,49
Mr ARTHUR ,Accordin g to the re-,49
NA,"cord i n Hansard, Sir John Quick dealt",49
NA,"very briefly with i t . Apparently, he f e l l",49
NA,into the same error as the Minister of,49
NA,Trade and Customs i n using an analogy,49
NA,He which does not exist between the powers,49
NA,of the United States and the powers of,49
NA,the Commonwealth i n their respective,49
NA,Constitutions. We do not wish to fall,49
NA,into any error. We require wider,49
NA,powers for the purpose of the welfare,49
NA,of the Commonwealth. A n effort was re-,49
NA,"cently made to get those wider powers,",49
NA,but they were refused; and though we feel,49
NA,Â° that we live under a very narrow Consti-,49
NA,"tution, we must appreciate the limits of",49
NA,that Constitution. I t is for that reason,49
NA,that I make these few remarks on the,49
NA,"constitutionality of the measure, while re-",49
NA,peating that I support the B i l l i n every,49
NA,particular. I hope the law advisers of the,49
NA,Government will find that the points,49
NA,"raised by Mr Justice Higgins, Professor",49
NA,"Moore, and other people are not valid.",49
NA,NA,49
NA,gratulate honorable members on the una-,49
NA,nimity displayed i n the direction of for-,49
NA,warding this measure. I think i t would,49
NA,be an advantage to the Commonwealth,49
NA,and the whole community i f the Common-,49
NA,wealth could control quarantine in regard,49
NA,to diseases in animals and plant life.,49
NA,Many farmers i n my district send,49
NA,potatoes to Deniliquin. These potatoes,49
NA,have to pass over the Victorian railway,49
NA,"system to reach .Echuca, where they re-",49
NA,"cross the border, and are forwarded to",49
NA,their destination. A t the time that Irish,49
NA,blight was prevalent i n the Common-,49
NA,"wealth, New South Wales was not quar-",49
NA,"antined, but Victoria was, and though",49
NA,potatoes on the way to Deniliquin could,49
NA,cross the border from New South Wales,49
NA,"into Victoria, when they reached Echuca",49
NA,they were classed as being affected by,49
NA,blight. I t would be well i f we could havo,49
NA,effective legislation dealing with this mat-,49
NA,"ter, so that a particular disease might be",49
NA,confined to a portion 'of a State irrespec-,49
NA,tive of State boundaries. I f there is,49
NA,"blight at Warrnambool, the quarantine",49
NA,need not apply to the whole of Victoria.,49
Mr TUDOR ,Tha t is a matter for the,49
NA,State Departments. The Commonwealth,49
NA,I has not the power.,49
NA,NA,50
NA,Federal Bureau has absolute power of think,50
NA,quarantine i n regard to diseases i n plant lately been,50
NA,"and animal life, and I consider a",50
NA,monwealth Bureau should be given the,50
NA,same power. The tick is prevalent i n,50
NA,"some districts of Queensland, but I think",50
NA,the quarantine should be restricted,50
NA,those areas. We are all concerned i n the,50
NA,"passing of this B i l l , because i t deals",50
NA,the most important industry i n Australia.,50
NA,"I t applies not only to the farmers, but Federation.",50
NA,also to the farm labourers.,50
NA,"homesteads and farmhouses, I have seen Federation ?",50
NA,the farm hands engaged at night in read-,50
NA,ing agricultural gazettes to improve their,50
NA,minds. They already have the practical,50
NA,"knowledge, and i t is our task to give them",50
NA,the theoretical knowledge. The farm,50
NA,labourer of to-day should be the farmer,50
NA,"of to-morrow, and should have every",50
NA,"portunity given to him, so that he",50
NA,attain a better position i n life.,50
NA,land laws are being considerably liberalother,50
NA,"ized to enable him to get a footing,",50
NA,"with his practical knowledge, combined",50
NA,"with a theoretical knowledge, he should",50
NA,be thoroughly equipped.,50

NA,mark can do that with her small popufood-stuffs,50
NA,"lation, surely we i n Australia, with our ing.",50
NA,wonderful potentialities and opportuniwin,50
NA,"ties, should be able to do more. I n New",50
NA,South Wales i t is said that every farmer,50
NA,needs to get a thorough grip of the three,50
NA,"F's-Farrar , fallow, and fertilizers. I t",50
NA,"was Mr Farrar who made the discovery modest sum of Â£5,000, which, divided",50
NA,of that wonderful wheat called Federaamong,50
NA,"tion, which is now used throughout",50
NA,tralia. We must put the farmers i n,50
NA,way of selecting the very best seed,50
NA,wheats. We need to put the best ferwe,50
NA,tilizers on the market to give the people,50
NA,an opportunity to examine their qualidiseases,50
NA,"ties, and use the very best, instead of",50
NA,ing with their wheat a lot of sand and,50
NA,"bish, as they have been doing i n the past.",50
NA,The Agricultura l Bureau could analyze,50
NA,"fertilizers, and act as advisers to the",50
NA,farmers i n this very important matter.,50
NA,"Fallowing is no new system, because a",50
NA,Roman ruler named Cincinnatus centuries,50
NA,the ago wrote largely on the subject. I,50
NA,the Federation wheat has,50
NA,eclipsed. I was 168-,50
NA,Commiles west from Melbourne the other,50
NA,day i n this wonderful State of Vic-,50
NA,"toria, and I saw a great deal of Federa-",50
NA,tion wheat growing. Fully one-third o f,50
NA,to the area under crop was sown with,50
NA,"Federation, but alongside I saw a better-",50
NA,"with wheat, namely, the Wallace, which should",50
NA,go one bag to the acre more than,50
Mr FLEMING , I s i t as hardy as,50
NA,NA,50
NA,stalk. I do not know whether i t will,50
NA,"stand the weather as well. Mr Farrar,",50
NA,"at the experimental farm at Windsor, i n",50
NA,"New South Wales, experimented for six",50
NA,opyears before he discovered the Federa-,50
NA,"may tion wheat, which produces something",50
NA,Our like 3 bushels an acre more than any,50
NA,wheat previously hybridized. I f,50
NA,"and we estimate that a third of the wheat,",50
NA,"grown i n Australia is Federation, then",50
NA,"on 8,000,000 acres under wheat the 3",50

NA,The honorable member f or Dar-,50
NA,was on the right lines i n suggesting,50
NA,a conference with the State Departments.,50
NA,There is danger of overlapping; we need,50
NA,"co-ordination, but I can see no harm i n",50
NA,passing the B i l l . I t will only cost the,50

NA,the much to ask the House to grant this,50
NA,amount to encourage the biggest industry,50
NA,have. A national agricultural bureau,50
NA,would deal with such things as the-,50
NA,"of sheep, horses and cattle,",50
NA,"mixpoisonous plants and weeds, and other-",50
NA,rubmatters common to the whole of Aus-,50
NA,"tralia, leaving to the State bureau the in -",50

NA,the conditions peculiar to our various dis-,50

NA,-give the national bureau power to deal,51

Mr SPENCE ,Darling) [9.37] -Th e,51
NA,Ministry has made two attempts to ex-,51
NA,plain its proposal for assisting the farm-,51
NA,ers; but I hope that whatever may be done,51
NA,will not in any way interfere with the,51
NA,excellent work of the State Departments.,51
NA,I protest against the idea that it is only,51
NA,in America and in other parts of the world,51
NA,that they do tilings. The people of,51
NA,America recognise the value of the train-,51
NA,ing which our institutions give to agri-,51
NA,"cultural students, and those who have gone",51
NA,there after passing tlirough the Hawkes-,51
NA,bury Agricultural College have had no,51
NA,difficulty in securing good positions in the,51
NA,States.' Even the Japanese realize the,51
NA,value of our institutions. The desire to,51
NA,go abroad for information reminds me of,51
NA,an incident which occurred i n this,52
NA,ber some years ago. The Vice-President,52
NA,"of the Executive Council, who was then",52
NA,"member of this House, attended a great to be used for agriculture.",52
NA,conference on dry farming i n the United,52
NA,"States, and returned f u l l of the wonderful",52
NA,discovery that he had heard of there-th,52
NA,profitable growing of crops with a 12-inch,52
NA,rainfall. B u t a member of this House,52
NA,showed him that i n his own electorate,52
NA,farming was being successfully carried toria.,52
NA,ou i n districts which had only that rain-,52
NA,fall. I have been pleased to hear,52
NA,"our greatest scientists, the late Mr Far-",52
NA,"rar, referred to. His loss was mourned",52
NA,more in other parts of the world than,52
NA,"was i n Australia, where he is only just",52
NA,"beginning to be 'appreciated. I know others,",52
NA,"another scientist, a constituent of mine,",52
NA,whose knowledge of our native grasses,52
NA,recognised and appreciated in the United,52
NA,States of America. He frequently,52
NA,ceives requests from the Agricultural,52
NA,Bureau there for grass seed and for,52
NA,formation about grasses.,52
Mr FLEMING , W h a t is his-name?,52
Mr SPENCE ,"H e is a Mr Greig. America,",52
NA,Those who visited the last show of,52
NA,Royal Agricultural Society in Sydney,52
NA,rsmember his magnificent display of ing,52
NA,grasses there. He is a great authority on ing to other countries for experts.,52
NA,"saltbush, too. A t several shows",52
NA,occupied a whole section with things that them more encouragement.,52
NA,lie had produced himself-clothing,52
NA,"leather, vegetables, and many other",52
NA,things. JtLe has demonstrated that,52
NA,tain plants will grow i n country where,52
NA,had been said they could not grow. There,52
NA,s.re a number of men like him whose inwhich,52
NA,vestigations have been encouraged by.the,52
NA,State bureaux. The State Departments men on the land all the time.,52
NA,are doing work that a central bureau,52
NA,could not do. I n South Australia there,52
NA,is a college and three experimental farms;,52
NA,in Victoria two colleges and five excentral,52
NA,perimental farms; i u Queensland,52
NA,college arid six experimental farms; in,52
NA,"New South Wales, the Hawkesbury A g r i",52
NA,"cultural College, which is known all over",52
NA,"the world, and sixteen experimental",52
NA,farms; in Western Australia five experinot,52
NA,mental farms; and i n Tasmania one. I n,52
NA,"New South Wales, under expert advice,",52
NA,experiments are continually proceeding find - something to,52
NA,with different soils and under different,52
NA,climatic conditions. The farmers,52
NA,selves are encouraged to experiment.,52
NA,best results are obtained from observations,52
NA,taken under natural conditions. I t was,52
NA,"thus that Mr Farrar, by his experiments, .",52
NA,champroduced that splendid wheat whicli has,52
NA,enabled country that was previously,52
NA,a thought capable only of producing grasa,52
NA,I n driving,52
NA,through country districts you will some-,52
NA,times see t i n plates on the fences with the,52
NA,"e names of different wheats on them, show-",52
NA,ing that the farmer is experimenting and,52
NA,keeping records under expert direction.,52
NA,This is being done a great deal i n Vic-,52
Mr FENTON ,Ha s much experimenting,52
NA,one of been done with natural grasses ?,52
Mr SPENCE , Mr Greig has experi-,52
NA,"mented chiefly with natural grasses, of",52
NA,i t which an immense number are known and,52
NA,"appreciated by pastoralists, but by few",52
NA,because i t is generally thought that,52
NA,to get anything good we must import. I t,52
NA,is is time that that idea was knocked on the,52
NA,head. Mr Greig has quite a big corres-,52
NA,"repondence with other countries, including",52
NA,"the great United States of America,",52
NA,inon the subject of Australian grasses.,52
NA,"Years ago Baron von Mueller, of",52
NA,"Melbourne, sent the saltbush to",52
NA,"and thus alkali plains,",52
NA,"the which had previously been valueless,",52
NA,will became worth 5s. per acre for carry-,52
NA,stock. I t is nonsense to talk of send-,52
NA,We,52
NA,"he have experts here, arid we should give",52
NA,I read as,52
NA,", many of their reports as I can for general",52
NA,information. The honorable member for,52
NA,cerCapricornia showed samples of them,52
NA,"i t here, and deserves credit for doing so.",52
NA,They gave some idea of the fine work,52
NA,all the States are doing i n the way,52
NA,of' publications. They are educating the,52
NA,Each,52
NA,"State has varying conditions, and six",52
NA,separate sets of officers are more likely to,52
NA,discover something of value than is - one,52
NA,bureau. W i t h one central bureau,52
NA,a 'you would have one man's idea only.,52
NA,W i t h six sets of officers you would have,52
NA,- different opinions and methods. I object,52
NA,to the work of the States being dupli-,52
NA,cated i n this regard. A strong case has,52
NA,"been made out, even by the Minister,",52
NA,"although I am not opposing the B i l l , be-",52
NA,"cause, possibly, the Federal bureau will",52
NA,do. The only,52
NA,thing of importance he has men-,52
NA,themtioned has related to diseases i n stock.,52
NA,The These are already being investigated,52
NA,"by all the State Departments, which have",52
NA,most excellent officers. I doubt i f,52
NA,cleverer men than the States have doing,52
NA,this work can be found. I t would be,53
NA,difficult to find a man more capable than,53
NA,an ordinary stock inspector whom I know,53
NA,"away back i n New South Wales, engaged",53
NA,"in looking after the sheep, &c. He con-",53
NA,"ducts his own experiments, and has his",53
NA,ownmicroscope and specimens. Such,53
NA,"men are worthy of every encouragement,",53
NA,and get i t under the present system. We,53
NA,must be very careful before we interfere,53
NA,with the splendid work they are doing.,53
NA,"This department of activity, while highly",53
NA,"important, is non-revenue producing, and",53
NA,we have seen a good deal of readiness on,53
NA,the part of the States to hand over all,53
NA,their non-productive Departments to,53
NA,Federation. The States may be only too,53
NA,"ready to hand over this matter, which is",53
NA,"costing, i n the aggregate, for their six",53
NA,"Departments, over Â£751,000 a year.",53
NA,"I n order to save cost, we must see that",53
NA,"efficiency is maintained, and i t would be",53
NA,a retrogressive step for the Commonwealth,53
NA,to attempt to centralize the work alto-,53
NA,"gether. This could not be properly done,",53
NA,as means of communication are not too,53
NA,easy. A farmer at Swan-Hill sends down,53
NA,to Melbourne for a regular supply of,53
NA,"seeds and information, but a farmer i n",53
NA,Queensland would not be so ready to send,53
NA,to a central bureau in Melbourne. I do,53
NA,not know that the Minister has shown,53
NA,that there has been any neglect by the,53
NA,State Departments of necessary work.,53
NA,am inclined to resent the implied reflec-,53
NA,tion on the States and the work they,53
NA,"have been doing,",53
Mr GROOM ,"Ther e was no reflection,",53
NA,either expressed or implied.,53
Mr SPENCE ,Ther e is an impli-,53
NA,cation that some work is neglected; but,53
NA,the States have not neglected any of the,53
NA,things which the Minister has mentioned.,53
NA,"His idea, and the idea of some honorable",53
NA,"members, seems to be that there are some",53
NA,geniuses elsewhere to be brought to Aus-,53
NA,tralia to tell us some things we do not,53
NA,know. I do not think he will find that,53
NA,any one of them can tell us more about,53
NA,diseases i n stock or plants than the Aus-,53
NA,tralian-trained men can. The Australian,53
NA,is the best of the lot. .Some of our weeds,53
NA,"are indigenous to Australia, and im -",53
NA,ported men have to learn all about them,53
NA,when they come here. I t is time we set,53
NA,to work seriously to encourage our own,53
NA,men. One of the greatest losses Aus-,53
NA,tralia has sustained was i n the death of,53
NA,the late Mr Farrar. I am glad the hon-,53
NA,orable member for Calare has given him,53
NA,- i,53
NA,credit for his magnificent work. I have,53
NA,"mentioned Mr Greig, and there are others",53
NA,whom I know. Mr Greig and Mr Farrar,53
NA,"were friends, and co-operated largely. One",53
NA,took up the investigation of saltbush and,53
NA,"grass, and the other wheat. Some of my",53
NA,constituents who met Mr Farrar have con-,53
NA,tinued experimenting with different kinds,53
NA,"of wheat i n the dry area, and are doing",53
NA,valuable work that is unknown to the,53
NA,general public. This work ought to be,53
NA,appreciated and encouraged. 1 am not,53
NA,"in opposition to the measure, because,",53
NA,"probably, the Minister will find some work",53
NA,to do in addition to what the States are,53
NA,doing when he starts the bureau.,53
NA,He has not told us anything that he is,53
NA,going to do that the States have neglected.,53
NA,I do not know how the Commonwealth is,53
NA,going to carry out its experiments. We,53
NA,have not found the States too ready to,53
NA,"grant land for Commonwealth purposes,",53
NA,although they will probably sell i t i f the,53
NA,Commonwealth is willing to buy i t . I do,53
NA,not think we shall reap the immense gain,53
NA,that the Minister seems to think. I have,53
NA,a very high opinion of the work being,53
NA,done so well and quietly by the various,53
NA,"State Departments, and i f we can help",53
NA,them i t will be a good thing. The,53
NA,"modern farmer, to be successful, must be",53
NA,"scientific, and the Australian farmer is",53
NA,I getting away from that old conservatism,53
NA,wliich thought that what was good enough,53
NA,for a man's grandfather must be good,53
NA,enough for him. The fact that he is,53
NA,abandoning those ideas is due to the edu-,53
NA,cational methods now adopted. The re-,53
NA,"cord shows that 95 per cent, of those who",53
NA,have passed through the Hawkesbury A g -,53
NA,ricultural College have either gone on the,53
NA,land or taken positions associated with,53
NA,"the land, many i n other parts of tho",53
NA,world. I hope the Minister will realize,53
NA,that we have plenty of trained men of,53
NA,our own to do experimental work of this,53
NA,kind miles ahead of any persons who can,53
NA,be brought from other parts of the,53
NA,world.,53
Mr FLEMING ,Robertson) [9.55] - I,53
NA,cordially indorse the remarks of the hon-,53
NA,orable member for Darling with regard to,53
NA,employing our own talent where i t is avail-,53
NA,able. A n y one who knows the bush knows,53
NA,that there are plenty of men available who,53
NA,understand our conditions better than an,53
NA,imported man could hope to do. They,53
NA,"have been brought up on the land, and",53
NA,trained to observe. They are producers,53
NA,by instinct and by training ; but tbe hon-,54
NA,orable member and I differ on the quesa,54
NA,tion of whether this matter should be,54
NA,"i n the hands of the States, or whether tlie",54
NA,Federal Parliament is to create a Bureau,54
NA,of Agriculture. I have here some,54
NA,marks made by the New South Wales Gowith,54
NA,"vernment Entomologist, Mr Walter Frogquestion",54
NA,"gatt, F . L . S . , who is an authority on",54
NA,matter. H e says-,54
NA,"As in Washington, a Federal Bureau here",54
NA,would include an economic entomologist,54
NA,cope with the many insect pests that are,54
NA,mon to all the States of the Commonwealth. most importance.,54
NA,This is one of the questions that will have to,54
NA,"be considered by the Federal Government, as it",54
NA,has already formed an agricultural branch in,54
NA,"the Northern Territory, with an experiment",54
NA,farm.,54
NA,"I f we had nothing else to deal with, the",54
NA,Commonwealth Parliament has at least,54
NA,the Northern Territory and the Federal,54
NA,"Capital Territory, which should give any",54
NA,amount of scope for all the experiments,54
NA,that we can call on our authorities to,54
NA,make. Mr Froggatt goes on to say-,54
NA,Among the questions affecting the whole of,54
NA,"Australia may be noted the following :-First ,",54
NA,"the locust, or grasshopper, plague.",54
NA,"That is a growing plague, increasing i u",54
NA,"intensity every year, most federal i n",54
NA,"character, and knowing no boundaries.",54
NA,The time is coming when Australia must,54
NA,"treat the matter seriously, as they do i n",54
NA,South Africa . Mr Froggatt says-,54
NA,The time is rapidly approaching when Aus-,54
NA,tralia will have to deal with the locust question.,54
NA,The locust plague is growing every,54
NA,"year, and whereas a few years ago we",54
NA,used to look on a visitation of locusts,54
NA,as a matter of merely a few days,54
NA,"and some slight trouble, when they",54
NA,come into a district now we know they,54
NA,will not leave i t until a considerable,54
NA,amount of damage has been done. Mr .,54
NA,Froggatt mentions one of the most i m -,54
NA,portant matters with which Australia has,54
NA,to deal-th e fly amongst sheep.,54
NA,sheep have practically ceased to increase.,54
NA,A l l over tlie world there has been a great,54
NA,"decrease i n the number of sheep, but we",54
NA,in Australia have been priding ourselves,54
NA,on the fact that all along ours have been,54
NA,"increasing. There can be no doubt, how-",54
NA,"ever, that unless we take steps to cope",54
NA,with the pests that trouble ourflocks we,54
NA,shall have before long a positive decrease.,54
NA,The fly pest is causing more destruction,54
NA,amongst our sheep than is anything else.,54
Mr SPENCE ,The destruction of birds,54
NA,as the result of the laying of poison for,54
NA,rabbits largely accounts for its existence.,54
NA,Mr Fleming.,54
Mr FLEMING , T h e poison cart -has,54
NA,"lot to do with the existence of the pest,",54
NA,"left and, undoubtedly, some action must be",54
NA,taken to deal with i t . As Mr Froggatt,54
NA,"rightly points out, the Commonwealth",54
NA,reParliament is the right authority to deal,54
NA,"the matter, and no more important",54
NA,than this could be threshed out,54
NA,this either i n this or any other House. De-,54
NA,spite what may be said by honorable mem-,54
NA,"bers opposite, I think i t must be admitted",54
NA,to that the wool-growing and meat produc-,54
NA,coming interests of Australia are of the ut-,54
Mr FENTON ,Th e export of lambs,54
NA,must be reducing our flocks.,54
Mr FLEMING , T h e trouble is due,54
NA,not so much to the lamb exports as to*,54
NA,the fact that we are not getting nearly,54
NA,so high a percentage of lambs as we used,54
NA,to obtain. The falling off is largely due,54
NA,to the f ly pest. Mr Froggatt says-,54
NA,It has been estimated on good authority that,54
NA,this new and increasing pest has costthe sheep-,54
NA,"men of Australia nearly ,Â£1,000,000 annually in",54
NA,"loss of wool, sheep, and lambs, not including",54
NA,the increased expenditure m station management,54
NA,in dressing the blown sheep.,54
NA,"I n my estimation, Mr Froggatt has un-",54
NA,"derstated the position. As he points out,",54
NA,this is an Australian rather than a purely,54
NA,"State matter, and i f the Bureau of A g r i -",54
NA,culture does no more than enable us t o,54
NA,get r i d of those two pests i t will have jus-,54
NA,tified its existence. The productions of,54
NA,"this country need to be fostered, and I",54
NA,hope that a Federal bureau will soon,54
NA,be established. Whilst the honorable,54
NA,"member for Darwin was speaking, an hon-",54
NA,orable member of the Opposition inquired,54
NA,whether the Bureau of Agriculture i n the,54
NA,United States had lowered the price of,54
NA,wheat. That has nothing to do with the,54
NA,question now' before us. We are face,54
NA,to face with the seriousfact that our,54
NA,productions are not increasing at any-,54
NA,Our thing like the rate at which our,54
NA,markets are extending. I t is surely essen-,54
NA,"tia l f or Australia, i f we are to keep-",54
NA,up the balance of our exports over im-,54
NA,"ports, that our production shall be i n -",54
NA,creased. I n that way alone can we hope to-,54
NA,maintain the high standard of civilization,54
NA,"and living which we enjoy, and which We",54
NA,all hope will improve rather than de-,54
NA,"crease. I trust that this bureau, which",54
NA,will extend its operations all over Aus-,54
NA,"tralia, will do much to help our producers,",54
NA,and that i t will so increase our pro-,54
NA,duction that we shall not only over-,54
NA,"take our markets, but have more than",54
NA,sufficient to pay the annual amount of i n -,55
NA,terest on our public debt.,55
Mr FENTON ,Maribyrnong) [10.3] -,55
NA,"I was very much struck by a paragraph,",55
NA,"which I made prisoner, setting f o r th a",55
NA,"statement made by Professor Watt, of the",55
NA,"Sydney University, that-",55
NA,I f all the dairy herds in the State were as,55
NA,"good and as well cared for as the best, the out-",55
NA,"put of butter would increase 50 per cent, without",55
NA,an additional acre ofland being utilized for the,55
NA,purpose-,55
NA,"A n d further, that- '",55
NA,I f all the wheat farmers in the State were,55
NA,farming to the standard of the best the average,55
NA,"yield, would be increased 50 per cent, with very",55
NA,little increase in the cost of production.,55
NA,Those are weighty words. I find that i f,55
NA,we could improve the average to the ex-,55
NA,"tent suggested by Professor W a t t , our",55
NA,annual wheat yield would be raised from,55
NA,"92,000,000 bushels to 184,000,000, repre-",55
NA,"senting an increase of Â£13,000,000 to the",55
NA,"wheat-growers of Australia, whilst our",55
NA,yield of butter would be increased from,55
NA,"187,000,000 lbs. to 374,000,000 lbs., or an",55
NA,increased value to our -dairy farmers of,55
NA,"Â£9,350,000. I n addition to this, there",55
NA,would be an increase i n the returns from,55
NA,"milk, cream, and cheese. I know some-",55
NA,"thing of the butter industry, and I do",55
NA,not hesitate to repeat the statement which,55
NA,was questioned when I uttered i t the,55
NA,"other day, that the return from our dairy",55
NA,herds is only about one-half what i t ought,55
NA,to be. The honorable member for Cor-,55
NA,"angamite seems to be surprised, but we",55
NA,have to remember that he resides i n a,55
NA,dairying district where the farmers get a,55
NA,return of from Â£ 1 3 to Â£ 1 4 per cow per,55
NA,annum. Those figures show how low must,55
NA,be the average i n respect of some of our,55
NA,"dairy farms, inasmuch as we are not get-",55
NA,ting throughout Australia to-day more,55
NA,than Â£ 7 per cow per annum. I n Den-,55
NA,mark the average return is Â£ 1 3 10s. per,55
NA,cow per annum.,55
Mr FLEMING , B u t remember the care,55
NA,they get.,55
Mr FENTON ,N o doubt they are,55
NA,"well cared for, but as against that, feed",55
NA,has to be imported for their use. They,55
NA,have to be housed for the greater part of,55
NA,the year because of the severity of the,55
NA,"climate. I n Australia, however, we can",55
NA,leave our dairy herds unrugged for nine,55
NA,months of the year.,55
Dr MALONEY , A n d i t is only i,55
NA,districts that our dairy cattle are rugged,55
NA,at all.,55
Mr FENTON ,Th e failure to pro-,55
NA,vide proper protection for dairy cattle,55
NA,during the winter months is responsible,55
NA,for heavy losses to our dairymen. The,55
NA,figures I have given should be interesting,55
NA,"to honorable members, and i f the Federal",55
NA,Bureau of Agriculture helps us to i n -,55
NA,crease our average returns to the extent,55
NA,"mentioned by Professor Watt, i t will have",55
NA,achieved something of which we may well,55
NA,be proud. I wish now to quote a few,55
NA,figures showing what the States are doing,55
NA,for the man on the land by the employ-,55
NA,ment of experts to assist him. Accord-,55
NA,ing to a paper laid on the table of the,55
NA,House by the Minister of Trade and Cus-,55
NA,"toms, the Department of Agriculture i n",55
NA,New South Wales employs the following,55
NA,"officers:-Agriculture , 405; forestry,",55
NA,"125; stock, 205; and botanic, 147, mak-",55
NA,ing a total of 882. The annual expendi-,55
NA,"ture is Â£273,916. I n the Victorian De-",55
NA,partment of Agricultur e the list of,55
NA,"officers is as follows:-Hea d office, 3 2 ;",55
NA,"agriculture, 50; stock and dairy, 83; ex-",55
NA,"port, 65; or a total of 230 officers, the",55
NA,"cost being Â£154,858 per annum. I n",55
NA,Queensland 336 officers are employed by,55
NA,"the Department, and the cost is",55
NA,"Â£100,857 per annum. I n the South Aus-",55
NA,tralian Department of Agriculture the,55
NA,experts employed are as follow -Agri -,55
NA,"culture, 128; stock, 24; produce, depart-",55
NA,"ment, 179; total, 331. The cost of the",55
NA,"Department is Â£125,019. A Liberal Go-",55
NA,vernment i n South Australia some time,55
NA,ago established a Produce Department i n,55
NA,connexion with which the largest butter,55
NA,factory i n the State is conducted. I t,55
NA,"receives cream from the farmers, manu-",55
NA,"factures butter, and exports any surplus",55
NA,"over local requirements, thus setting a",55
NA,very excellent example to the dairymen,55
NA,of the State.,55
Mr SAMPSON ,Ther e is only a defi-,55
NA,"ciency of about Â£350,000 i n connexion)",55
NA,with that Department.,55
Mr FENTON ,Th e whole cost of the,55
NA,"Department, including the agriculture,",55
NA,"stock, and produce branches, is only.",55
NA,"Â£125,019.",55
Mr SAMPSON ,Tha t is not correct.,55
Mr FENTON ,The n the honorable-,55
NA,member had better quarrel with the M i n -,55
NA,"ister of Trade and Customs, who pre^",55
NA,sented to the House the paper from which,55
NA,I have taken these figures. I n the West-,55
NA,n a few ern Australian Department there are 110,55
NA,"agricultural experts, 14 stock experts,",55
NA,"and 1.74 miscellaneous officers, or a total!",55
NA,"of 298, the annual cost being Â£87,122.",56
NA,I n Tasmania there are 16 agricul-,56
NA,"tural experts and 7 stock experts, the",56
NA,"cost of the Department being Â£9,472 .",56
NA,The six State Departments are thus,56
NA,"spending Â£751,244 per annum, and em-",56
NA,"ploy 2,100 experts.",56
Mr GROOM ,Woul d the honorable,56
NA,member say they were all experts' The,56
NA,-figures include f r u i t inspectors and,56
NA,ministrative officers.,56
Mr FENTON ,Tha t may be. The,56
NA,fact remains that the States are expend-,56
NA,ing three-quarters of a million pounds,56
NA,per annum i n carrying on work similar to,56
NA,that with whicli this bureau will deal.,56
NA,Care must be exercised that we do not,56
NA,overlap. This bureau should work i n,56
NA,"harmony with the State Departments, and",56
NA,should make an effort to branch out upon,56
NA,new lines of investigation. Another mat-,56
NA,ter which should also receive the atten-,56
NA,tion of the bureau is the underground,56
NA,water supplies of Australia. We have,56
NA,far more water underground than we have,56
NA,in sight. Our artesian water supplies are,56
NA,"the greatest we have. Mr Symonds, an",56
NA,agricultural chemist i n the Department,56
NA,"of Agriculture i n New South Wales, said",56
NA,some time ago that i f we could extract,56
NA,from these artesian supplies the minerals,56
NA,that are so destructive to vegetable,56
NA,"growth - and life, we should be able to",56
NA,open up millions of acres i n the western,56
NA,"and north-western divisions of that State,",56
NA,and to profitably cultivate them. I hope,56
NA,that the matter will receive the attention,56
NA,"of the Commonwealth bureau, f or i f ex-",56
NA,periments in this direction proved success-,56
NA,f u l we should be able to open up new,56
NA,"country, and settle many people upon i t .",56
NA,"I heartily favour this B i l l , and would",56
NA,like to see a really live Department of,56
NA,Agriculture established i n the Common-,56
NA,wealth.,56
Mr SAMPSON ,Wimmera) [10.14] -,56
NA,There is a general consensus of opinion,56
NA,that the Federal Bureau of Agriculture,56
NA,is to be endowed with functions that are,56
NA,highly essential to the advancement of,56
NA,the agricultural section of the community.,56
NA,Anything that will tend to increase pri-,56
NA,mary production should command the,56
NA,hearty support of all honorable members;,56
NA,"indeed, there is no room f or any opposi-",56
NA,"tion. The only question is, how far the",56
NA,States are prepared tb relinquish some of,56
NA,their present functions in order that a,56
NA,Federal Bureau may have f u l l scope for,56
NA,its activities. M y idea is that this,56
NA,"bureau, instead of being established for",56
NA,"research work only, should be a practical",56
NA,as well as a theoretical institution. Com-,56
NA,parisons have been made between the pro-,56
NA,posed bureau and that of the United,56
NA,"States of America; but, as a matter of",56
NA,"fact, there is no analogy between the two.",56
NA,The United States Agricultura l Depart-,56
NA,"ment covers a wide field of research, ex-",56
NA,adperimental and practical administrative,56
NA,"work, such as we cannot possibly under-",56
NA,"take. I n the first place,'we have no com-",56
NA,"mand of the public estate, while the",56
NA,American Department has been enabled,56
NA,"to achieve the great results i t has, simply",56
NA,"by the fact that, i n the early days, two-",56
NA,thirds of the public lands were vested i n,56
NA,the Government. This great distinction,56
NA,between the two Constitutions ought to be,56
NA,borne i n mind i n discussing these matters.,56
NA,"I n America, the Bureau of Agriculture",56
NA,has the advantage of liberal financial sup-,56
NA,port from the revenue raised by the sales,56
NA,of the public estate to cultivators.,56
Mr RILEY ,I beg to call attention to,56
NA,the state of the House. [Quorum formed.'],56
Mr SAMPSON ,I n view of a general,56
NA,"desire to pass the second reading now, I",56
NA,shall not further detain honorable mem-,56
NA,bers.,56

Dr MALONEY ,Melbourne) [10.20].,56
NA,-Thi s is one of the most important sub-,56
NA,jects any Government or Legislature could,56
NA,"consider; and there w i l l not be, I know,",56
NA,any opposition to the proposal now before,56
NA,"us. I trust that this bureau, as a central",56
NA,"body, will follow the splendid example set",56
NA,in the United States. There any farmer,56
NA,"or settler, on written application, is sup-",56
NA,"plied with a small booklet, and some-",56
NA,"times a large one, informing liim how to",56
NA,cultivate any special products. A n i n -,56
NA,"teresting fact is that, great as the value",56
NA,"of the wheat harvest of America is, i t is",56
NA,now second to that of the poultry indus-,56
NA,"try. Some fifteen or twenty years ago,",56
NA,Australia lost a very valuable customer,56
NA,"for her wheat i n the French Government,",56
NA,because the article supplied was not up to,56
NA,"sample. I n other words, the wheat did",56
NA,not contain enough gluten; and the,56
NA,French have always been very particular,56
NA,"in this regard, whether the bread be for",56
NA,"their citizens at home, or for their con-",56
NA,victs and soldiers in New Caledonia.,56
NA,"Since then, however,, various agricultural",56
NA,"colleges, especially that at Dookie, where",57
NA,the experiments i n regard to the Federa-,57
NA,"tion wheat were carried on, have suc-",57
NA,ceeded i n producing a wheat that will,57
NA,"ultimately take the place of flesh, so much",57
NA,have the food constituents been developed.,57
NA,"Over 20,000 varieties are planted at",57
NA,Dookie every year; and I may refer to,57
NA,the success that has been met.with i n con-,57
NA,nexion with what is known as macaroni,57
NA,"wheat. Even i n Italy , the white of an",57
NA,egg has to be added to the flour,57
NA,"in order to make macaroni,",57
NA,in - the case of the wheat grown,57
NA,"at Dookie, the flour alone is suffi-",57
NA,cient. That needs only to be known to,57
NA,create a demand for our seed from all,57
NA,"parts of the world. I n this connexion,",57
NA,"I wish to pay a compliment, not only to",57
NA,NA,57
NA,NA,57
NA,"leges, and others like them, are engaged",57
NA,in friendly rivalry that must prove of -,57
NA,benefit to the whole community.,57
NA,best asset that a country can have is the,57
NA,scientifically trained farmer.,57
NA,compare the farming methods of England,57
NA,generally with the farming as carried on,57
NA,"in nearly every part of the Continent,",57
NA,we realize that the old-fashioned ideas,57
NA,must give way to the advance of science-.,57
NA,I t has beeu said that Denmark takes more,57
NA,sovereigns from England for her proauce,57
NA,than are represented by all the gold pro-,57
NA,"duced i n Australia. I n that country,",57
NA,they have learned to develop what are,57
NA,"known as the heath lands, which, after",57
NA,"twenty years' work, have been rendered",57
NA,f r u i t f u l . I f we are going to import,57
NA,"specialists, I should say we ought to get",57
NA,"them from Denmark or Holland, but only",57
NA,to supply us with information i n branches,57
NA,regarding which Australian-trained men,57
NA,have no experience. We have university,57
NA,"men now teaching, not only at Dookie,",57
NA,"but at Hawkesbury; and they have, beside",57
NA,"the necessary brain power, opportunities",57
NA,for acquiring knowledge to the same ex-,57
NA,tent as workers i n the same directions,57
NA,have i n other countries. I look forward,57
NA,to the time when every young Austra-,57

Mr CHARLTON , I have had numewhen,60

NA,"and have been appointed officers, find i t Ordinance.",60
NA,"difficult to obtain uniforms, and do not",60

Mr FISHER , I do not wish to lose,60

NA,was think that i t would be well to per-,60

Mr GLYNN ,W e can give a promise,60

Mr FISHER ," I t would be unwise,",60
NA,there is a difference of this kind,60

Mr GLYNN , I t can be done i n an,60
Mr FISHER , W e should have some-,60
NA,"thing tangible, something i n writing, be-",60
NA,cause verbal statements do not count for,60
NA,but much. I think most honorable members,60
NA,desire to see the B i l l carried. I will do,60
NA,"best to get a Constitution voted, but",60
NA,the we should have something more than a,60
NA,mere verbal promise i n this matter of,60
NA,tenure.,60
Mr GLYNN ,Tha t could not be done,60
NA,"tonow, but when the Executive Council is",60
NA,dealing with the matter provision could,60
NA,be made by Ordinance that this land,60
NA,of should be kept as a reserve. I t will,60
NA,"not be sold i n any case, because i t is",60
Mr FISHER , N o t only should no,60
NA,"land be alienated, but i t should be re-",60

NA,obbe made impossible to alienate i t except,60
NA,A n Ordinance,60

NA,t i l a clear statement that the Government,60
NA,will not deal with this reserve land i n any,60
NA,way other than was indicated by the Min -,60
NA,ister i n charge of the B i l l . I f that assur-,60
NA,ance can be conveyed through the repre-,60
NA,sentative of the Government i n another,60
NA,"place, perhaps the difficulty can be got",60
NA,for over. I have not had an opportunity of,60
NA,with my colleagues i n another,60

NA,"t we they hold very strong views on i t , and",60
NA,if that suggestion will bridge the diffi-,60

NA,as far as possible and practicable with,60
NA,W i l l the Prime Minister state,60
NA,has when an opportunity will be afforded to,60
NA,discuss private members' business ? I,60
NA,want particularly to discuss some business,60

Mr ATKINSON ,Wilmot) [11.4] -,61
NA,Owing to the peculiar nature of the situa-,61

NA,in a very precarious position.,61
NA,never knew when one would have,61
NA,a chance to bring a motion for-,61
NA,ward. I had a motion on,61
NA,notice-paper which was discussed slightly,61
NA,with reference to tho inspection of produce,61
NA,passing from State to State. Is i t the,61
NA,intention of the Minister of Trade and,61
NA,Customs to look into that matter during,61
NA,the recess to see i f some better and more,61
NA,satisfactory conditions can be brought,61
NA,about for the producers than they have,61
NA,"at the present time, either through the",61
NA,Commonwealth agency or in conjunction,61
NA,with the States. Perhaps they can i n -,61
NA,duce the States to come to a more satis-,61
NA,factory and amicable arrangement,61
NA,amo'ngst themselves'. I am not par-,61
NA,"ticular how i t is done, so long as a",61
NA,generous and real effort is made on be-,61
NA,half of the producers.,61
Mr GROOM ,Darling Downs-Minis -,61
NA,ter of Trade and Customs) [11.6] -Whe n,61
NA,the honorable member's motion was being,61
NA,"considered, 1 pointed out that i t was im-",61
NA,possible for the Commonwealth to take,61
NA,over Inter-State inspection at this stage.',61
NA,I promised him and other members at the,61
NA,time that we' certainly would make re-,61
NA,presentations to Western Australia with,61
NA,respect to their regulations. We received,61
NA,a telegram from Mr Scaddan nn Mon-,61
NA,"day, informing us that a despatch dealing",61
NA,with the matter IB on its way to the De-,61
NA,partment. I can assure the honorable,61
NA,member that the matter will be looked,61
NA,into during the recess. Certainly any,61
NA,inclination on the part of the States to,61
NA,use their inspection regulations for' other,61
NA,than purely inspection purposes will re-,61
NA,ceive the attention of the Department.,61
NA,Mr JOSEPH COOK .(Parramatta-,61
NA,Prime Minister and Minister of Home,61
NA,Affairs) [11.7] - I hope the Leader of the,61

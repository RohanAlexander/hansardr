NA,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS.,14
NA,"FINANCIAL RELATIONS, COMMONWEALTH",14
NA,AND STATES.,14
Mr HENRY WILLIS ,Robertson),14
NA,[10.31] - r wish to make a personal ex-,14
NA,planation. During his very interesting,14
NA,"speech last evening, the honorable member",14
NA,for iFremantle referred to a statement made,14
NA,by me on the previous day regarding the,14
NA,proposed arrangement for future payments,14
NA,"by the Commonwealth to the States, and",14
NA,contrasted it with what I said a year or,14
NA,two ago on the same subject. But in my,14
NA,earlier speech. I was referring to the pro-,14
NA,1,14
NA,bable future expansion of the Common-,14
NA,"wealth power, and the services which would",14
NA,have to be taken over. I said-,14
NA,It does not necessarily follow that we should,14
NA,take over these large services at once.,14
NA,"Then come these words, which were",14
NA,quoted by the honorable member-,14
NA,We cannot adjust the nnancial relations of,14
NA,the Commonwealth and States unless we take,14
NA,over these great services. Unless we obtain,14
NA,control of them we must return to the States,14
NA,"at least ^9,000,000 annually.",14
NA,The honorable member for Fremantle has,14
NA,"charged me with inconsistency, but the",14
NA,two speeches are quite consistent. In,14
NA,"1907-8, the States were receiving from the",14
NA,"Commonwealth ,£8,856,905. That sum I",14
NA,wish to capitalize under a scheme which I,14
NA,put forward as better than that of the Go-,14
NA,vernment. He claims that I should sup-,14
NA,"port the Government scheme, but the quo-",14
NA,tation which he made does not prove that,14
NA,I was ever in favour of such an arrange-,14
NA,ment. I proposed to give to the States,14
NA,to the very fraction what the Government,14
NA,"proposes to give to them, and to take from",14
NA,"them, within a trifling amount, what would",14
NA,be taken from them under the Government,14
NA,"scheme. But, instead of first giving them",14
NA,"25s. per capita, and then taking away",14
NA,that and 14s. 3d. to pay the interest on the,14
NA,"public debt, I would treat them much more",14
NA,liberally. I would give the States as,14
NA,much as they would receive under the,14
NA,"Government proposal, and was within the",14
NA,"mark in saying that £9,000,000 would",14
NA,have to be returned to them on the basis,14
NA,of the 1907-8 payment. The basis of,14
NA,the calculation on which the Government,14
NA,"scheme rests is not sound, whereas my",14
NA,scheme has an actuarial foundation.,14
Mr SPEAKER ,Th e honorable mem-,14
NA,ber must not discuss the Government,14
NA,scheme.,14
Mr HENRY WILLIS , I am merely,14
NA,mentioning facts which show that my,14
NA,speeches on this subject have not been in-,14
NA,consistent. I propose to give to each,14
NA,State what it is actually entitled to. I t,14
NA,is because the Government scheme will not,14
NA,do so that I cannot support it. My scheme,14
NA,"would provide funds for all time, whatever",14
NA,the expansion of the Commonwealth ex-,14
NA,penditure might be by reason of the taking,14
NA,"over of new services, but under the Go-",14
NA,vernment proposal such expansion cannot,14
NA,be provided for.,14
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY -Th e honorable,14
NA,member's scheme is a good one.,14
Mr HENRY WILLIS ," I fear, Mr.",14
NA,"Speaker, that you may think that it was",14
NA,arranged between the honorable member,14
NA,for Fremantle and me that he should make,14
NA,"the quotation to which I have referred, in",14
NA,order that. I might have an opportunity,14
NA,this morning to again explain the merits,14
NA,"of my scheme, but I assure you that, al-",14
NA,"though we sit together, nothing of the kind",14
NA,has been done.,14
Mr WISE ,Gippsland) [10.37] -Un -,14
NA,"fortunately, I was temporarily absent last",14
NA,evening when the honorable member for,14
NA,Fremantle referred to something which I,14
NA,said in this House on a former occasion.,14
NA,He quoted from a speech delivered in,14
NA,"1907, to charge me with inconsistency. To",14
NA,"understand the position, it must be remem-",14
NA,bered that my remarks were made in con-,14
NA,sequence of something said by the honor-,14
NA,"able member for Flinders who, in estimat-",14
NA,ing what the revenue from Customs duties,14
NA,"would be a few years ahead, referred to",14
NA,the States' debts. He said-,14
NA,What we might fairly say is that the lower,14
NA,limit bf tbe amount which we ought to hand,14
NA,"back to the States is that which, to my mind, is",14
NA,impliedly prescribed by the Constitution. I re-,14
NA,"fer to what is, I think, the basis of the consti-",14
NA,"tional proposals, and that is that we should",14
NA,burden ourselves with the whole ofthe interest,14
NA,of the States' debts as existing at the time of the,14
NA,establishment of the Commonwealth. I believe,14
NA,that to have been in the minds of most of those,14
NA,who framed our Constitution,14
Mr SPEAKER ,Th e honorable mem-,14
NA,ber is now dealing with the speech of an-,14
NA,other honorable member which is not in,14
NA,question. I ask him to confine himself to,14
NA,a personal explanation of such remarks of,14
NA,his as he considers to have been misrepre-,15
NA,sented.,15
Mr WISE , I cannot do so without re-,15
NA,ferring to the speech of the honorable,15
NA,member for Flinders.,15
Mr SPEAKER ,Th e honorable mem-,15
NA,"ber may refer to it incidentally, but may",15
NA,not quote from it at length. Were such,15
NA,"quotations allowed, it would be possible,",15
NA,"under cover of a personal explanation, to",15
NA,read the whole of the speech made by,15
NA,another honorable member.,15
Mr WISE ,Th e report of the speech,15
NA,of the honorable member for Flinders,15
NA,"covers several pages of Hansard, and I",15
NA,wish to read only about twenty lines of it.,15
NA,"I f I cannot do so now, I shall",15
NA,certainly take an opportunity to deal,15
NA,with the matter fully on the second reading,15
NA,of the Bill; but to clear myself now of the,15
NA,charge of Inconsistency let me say that the,15
NA,honorable member for Flinders had stated,15
NA,that the idea in the minds of the members,15
NA,of the Convention .was that the Common-,15
NA,"wealth, in taking over the Customs and",15
NA,"-Excise revenue, should take with it the",15
NA,"sponsibility for the debts, and the interest",15
NA,"on them, at the time of federating. He",15
NA,"pointed out that, in his opinion, the",15
NA,revenue from Customs and Excise in two or,15
NA,"three years' time would be £9,000,000,",15
NA,of which three-fourith's would be about,15
NA,"£6,750,000. As that would not be suf-",15
NA,"ficient to pay interest on their debts, he",15
NA,"proposed to give them another £500,000,",15
NA,"or, in all, about £7,250,000. I said",15
NA,"that I agreed with that proposal, but, since",15
NA,then we have relieved the States of ex-,15
NA,penditure on old-age pensions amounting,15
NA,"to £1,500,000, which brings the amount",15
NA,"down to less than £6,000,000. When",15
NA,"speaking the other evening, I said that I",15
NA,had no objection to the proposal on the,15
NA,score of the amount that it was proposed,15
NA,"to pay to the States, but that I was in",15
NA,"favour of the Lyne-Deakin scheme, which",15
NA,"was based on the Harper scheme, under",15
NA,"which the States would have received, to",15
NA,1,15
NA,"begin with, £6,000,000. The honorable",15
NA,member for Mernda originally proposed to,15
NA,"give them £6,500,000 a year. ""Under the",15
NA,scheme now before us they would get,15
NA,"about £5,500,000 a year. In reply to an",15
NA,"interjection, I said the other evening that",15
NA,1 was in favour of the scheme which the,15
NA,honorable member for Mernda outlined in,15
NA,his speech on the Constitution Alteration,15
NA,(Finance) Bill. He proposed that the,15
NA,States should receive 25s. per capita until,15
NA,"their population had increased to 7,200,000,",15
NA,"and the payments to £9,000,000, the",15
NA,"amount of the interest on the State debts,",15
NA,as they exist at the present day. I found,15
NA,"no fault with the proposal to pay,",15
NA,"£5,500,000 to the States, and was, in-",15
NA,"deed, prepared to commence vvith a pay-",15
NA,"ment of £6,000,000 under the Lyne-Dea-",15
NA,kin scheme. The honorable member for,15
NA,Mernda showed that the payments under,15
NA,"his scheme would increase to £9,000,000",15
NA,in about the same length of time as they,15
NA,would increase to that sum under the,15
NA,Lyne-Deakin scheme-betwee n thirty and,15
NA,thirty-five years. There was no incon-,15
NA,sistency between my speech of 1907 and,15
NA,that of the other evening.,15
Mr HEDGES ,Fremantle) [10.42] -,15
NA,By way of personal explanation,15
Mr SPEAKER , I hope that honor-,15
NA,"able members do not intend to, each day,,",15
NA,redeliver speeches vvhich they have recently,15
NA,made. The right of personal explanation,15
NA,is always afforded to honorable members,15
NA,"who have been misrepresented, but May",15
NA,points out clearly that such explanations,15
NA,reare against the forms and rules of the,15
NA,"House, and an indulgence which should",15
NA,be only used on very important occasions.,15
NA,1 hope that honorable members will not,15
NA,"feel it incumbent on them, when a personal",15
NA,"explanation has been made, and their",15
NA,"names, perhaps only incidentally, men-",15
NA,"tioned, to make explanations on their own",15
NA,account. I f the honorable member desires,15
NA,"to explain something vvhich he has said,",15
NA,"and which has been misrepresented, I shall",15
NA,"allow him to proceed, but I hope that this",15
NA,will not continue verv much further.,15
Mr HEDGES , I wish to explain,15
NA,something whichhas been misrepresented.,15
NA,What I said last night has been mis-,15
NA,understood. The honorable member for,15
NA,Gippsland misunderstood the point which,15
NA,1 took. It was contained in the quotation,15
NA,of these words-,15
NA,"Such an amount represents about ^500,000 in",15
NA,excess of the three-fourths of the present Cus-,15
NA,toms revenue.,15
NA,POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S,15
NA,DEPARTMENT.,15
NA,OVERSEA MAIL CONTRACT : STAY OF,15
NA,VESSELS IN PORT-MORE E POST,15
NA,OFFICE-CHARG E AGAINST A POSTAL,15
NA,ASSISTANT.,15
Mr FRAZER ,I n regard to the sug-,15
NA,gested alteration of ' the time-table for the,15
NA,"oversea mails, I wish to ask the Post-",15
NA,"master-General i f , during the currency of",15
NA,the present contract with the Orient,16
NA,"Steam Navigation Company, "" complaint",16
NA,has been lodged with the Department that,16
NA,the time allowed under it for the stay of,16
NA,their steamers at Port Melbourne is insuf-,16
NA,ficient to enable the necessary loading to,16
NA,take place?,16
Sir JOHN QUICK , I am not aware,16
NA,of any such complaint having been made.,16
NA,Under the new contract the cool storage,16
NA,accommodation provided on the vessels of,16
NA,"the company will be increased to 2,000 tons.",16
NA,The taking in of cargo to fill that largely,16
NA,"increased space will, it is said, require",16
NA,"additional time, and the vessels of the",16
NA,company will not be able to load in time,16
NA,to leave Adelaide as hitherto on Thursday.,16
NA,The company is therefore strongly urging,16
NA,"the adoption of the new time-table, which",16
NA,will enable its vessels to leave Adelaide on,16
NA,Friday.,16
Mr FRAZER , I wish to ask the,16
NA,Postmaster-General whether the cool stor-,16
NA,"age space now provided on the Moldavia,",16
NA,"the Morea, and two or three other new",16
NA,steamers of the Peninsular and Oriental,16
NA,Steam Navigation Company is equal,16
NA,to that which has to be provided,16
NA,on the new vessels of the Orient,16
NA,Steam Navigation Company's,16
NA,"vice. I f it is, will the honorable gentle-",16
NA,man say whether a complaint has been,16
NA,made that the time allowed at present to,16
NA,fill that space at Port Melbourne is insuffi-,16
NA,cient ?,16
Sir JOHN QUICK , I am not aware,16
NA,of the exact extent of the cool storage accom-,16
NA,modation provided at present on the ves-,16
NA,sels of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam,16
NA,"Navigation Company, but there is a",16
NA,material difference between the two.,16
NA,Another point which must not be over-,16
NA,looked is that the vessels of the Peninsular,16
NA,and Oriental Steam Navigation Company,16
NA,"terminate their voyage at Sydney, whereas",16
NA,the Orient Company's vessels have to go,16
NA,"on to Brisbane, and they cannot go there",16
NA,"and back, and take in cargo at Port Mel-",16
NA,"bourne, in the same time as do the vessels",16
NA,on the other line whose terminal port is,16
NA,Port Jackson.,16
Mr THOMAS BROWN , I desire to,16
NA,ask the Postmaster-General whether his at-,16
NA,tention has been drawn to the following tele-,16
NA,"gram, appearing in this morning's issue of",16
NA,"the Age, under the headings "" Alleged Em-",16
NA,"bezzlement "" ; ""Postal official charged.""",16
NA,""" A n overworked staff.""",16
NA,At the Moree Quarter Sessions to-day Stanley,16
NA,"George Weber, assistant at the local post-office,",16
NA,"was charged with stealing £ S , the property of",16
NA,the Commissioners of the Government Savings,16
NA,Bank. Accused pleaded not guilty. . . . The,16
NA,Crown Prosecutor described the condition of af-,16
NA,fairs at the Moree post-office at that time as,16
NA,chaotic and disgraceful. Further evidence,16
NA,showed that complaints were frequent about thai,16
NA,time of the Moree post-office being undermanned,16
NA,and the staff overworked. The business was very,16
NA,"heavy, and large sums of money passed through",16
NA,the hands of youths like defendant. I n a writ-,16
NA,ten statement defendant attributed his failure to,16
NA,hand over the £ 8 to the rush of work at the,16
NA,"counter, and the non-entry of the amount in the",16
NA,office book owing to the latter having been mis-,16
NA,laid.,16
NA,Acting Judge Dawson commented in strong,16
NA,terms on the Postal Department summoning de-,16
NA,fendant some time after the missing money had,16
NA,"been handed in by the defendant. There was,",16
NA,"he said, considerable doubt in the case, and",16
NA,therefore the jury could not convict. The jury,16
NA,acquitted defendant.,16
NA,Is the Postmaster-General aware that the,16
NA,chaotic condition of affairs referred to is,16
NA,"not peculiar to the Moree post-office, but ob-",16
NA,"tains generally throughout the States, and",16
NA,"will he take steps to remove, as speedily",16
NA,"as possible, the cause of complaint as to",16
NA,the undermanning of the Department?,16
NA,"Further, will he inquire into this case and",16
NA,ascertain why the prosecution was instituted,16
NA,in the circumstances to which the learnea,16
NA,ser- Judge referred?,16
Sir JOHN QUICK , I gave no,16
NA,"authority for the prosecution, which must,",16
NA,"therefore, have been instituted by the De-",16
NA,puty Postmaster-General of New South,16
NA,"Wales, acting on legal advice. Under",16
NA,"his delegated power, he has a certaindis-",16
NA,cretion .,16
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Thi s was a prose-,16
NA,cution in connexion with Savings Bank,16
NA,work.,16
Sir JOHN QUICK ,Th e Moree post-,16
NA,office transacts business in connexion with,16
NA,the Savings Bank.,16
Mr THOMAS BROWN ,Tha t is so.,16
Sir JOHN QUICK ,Ther e has been,16
NA,some slight disorganization in the Moree,16
NA,post-office. The matter has been brought be-,16
NA,"fore me, and I have on two or three occasions",16
NA,directed the attention of the Deputy Post-,16
NA,master-General of New South Wales to it.,16
NA,He reported that the disorganization arose,16
NA,from the frequent changes made .in the,16
NA,"office, and he promised to rectify the",16
NA,"matters complained of. No doubt, in times",16
NA,"past, there has been ground for complaint",16
NA,of undermanning in connexion with many,16
NA,"post-offices, but I need scarcely remind the",16
NA,"honorable member that, in the Estimates",16
NA,"now before the House, provision is made",16
NA,for an increase of over 600 hands in the,17
NA,staff of the Department in New South,17
NA,Wales. I t is believed that when those ad-,17
NA,ditional hands are employed many of the,17
NA,complaints about overwork and overtime,17
NA,will be removed.,17
NA,. DISORDERLY QUESTIONS.,17
NA,ABSENCE OF THE OPPOSITION.,17
Dr WILSON ," I have noticed, with",17
NA,"great pain, Mr Speaker, that during the",17
NA,last few . mornings honorable members,17
NA,usually occupying the direct Opposition,17
NA,benches have been absent when the House,17
NA,"has met, and I wish to ask .whether you",17
NA,have received any information from them,17
NA,that they object to the prayers.,17
Mr FRAZER ,I f we drew attention to,17
NA,every absence on the part of the honorable,17
NA,member at the opening of the House the,17
NA,record would be a pretty long one.,17
Dr LIDDELL ,"I n all sincerity, Mr.",17
NA,"Speaker, and with a full sense of the re-",17
NA,"sponsibility of my position, I desire to",17
NA,ask whether you can inform the House,17
NA,what has become of our dear friend and,17
NA,"comrade, and ex-Leader of the Opposi-",17
NA,"tion, the honorable member for South",17
NA,Sydney'.,17
Mr SPEAKER , I think that I ought,17
NA,to be able to rely upon honorable members,17
NA,to put to the Chair only such questions,17
NA,as relate to matters with which the Chair,17
NA,"is concerned. I may say, in passing, that",17
NA,the Chair is not supposed to answer ques-,17
NA,tions. I sincerely hope that I shall not,17
NA,have to remind honorable members again,17
NA,that it is unbecoming to put to the Chair,17
NA,questions of the character of those which,17
NA,have just been addressed to me. Questions,17
NA,of a similar character have previously been,17
NA,allowed'by the Chair to pass without com-,17
NA,"ment, but they ought not to be made.",17
Mr MCDONALD , I wish to ask your,17
NA,"ruling, Mr Speaker, on a point of order",17
NA,in regard to the two questions to which,17
NA,"you have just, very properly, taken excep-",17
NA,tion. Is an honorable member in order,17
NA,"in rising, under pretence of asking a ques-",17
NA,"tion, and deliberately offering an insult",17
NA,either to an honorable member or to a party,17
NA,in this House? I f such a practice is to,17
NA,be continued by honorable members oppo-,17
NA,"site, the Opposition will have to retaliate.",17
Mr SPEAKER , I think that the,17
NA,honorable member will admit that I have,17
NA,already dealt with the two questions in the,17
NA,only way in which they could be dealt,17
NA,with. I t is impossible for the Chair to,17
NA,know the nature of the question that an,17
NA,"honorable member is going to put, but the",17
NA,growth of the practice of asking questions,17
NA,without notice is very largely responsible,17
NA,for what has just taken place. In the,17
NA,Parliament with which I was previously,17
NA,"connected, questions without notice were",17
NA,not asked without the permission of the,17
NA,"Chair, previously obtained, and with'",17
NA,the permission of the Minister who was to,17
NA,be interrogated. But for the practice which,17
NA,has grown up in this House we should,17
NA,haye been spared questions of the kind to,17
NA,"which attention has just been directed, and",17
NA,"which, I think, are disorderly and of an",17
NA,objectionable character.,17
Mr THOMAS BROWN , I desire to,17
NA,ask Mr Speaker whether the insulting,17
NA,questions addressed to you - questions,17
NA,which you have described as disorderly- -,17
NA,in regard to honorable members on this side,17
NA,of the House,17
Mr SPEAKER , I f the honorable,17
NA,"member will permit me, I think that I have",17
NA,dealt with the matter in a way which will,17
NA,"prevent its recurrence, and that no good",17
NA,can be obtained by putting further ques-,17
NA,"tions, which must tend only to embarrass",17
NA,the Chair.,17
Mr THOMAS BROWN ,I wish to,17
NA,"ask, sir, whether the questions addressed to",17
NA,"you in respect to the Opposition, and which",17
NA,"you have held to be disorderly, are to ap-",17
NA,pear in Hansard ? They seem to have been,17
NA,asked solely with the object of securing,17
NA,their publication in Hansard.,17
Mr SPEAKER , That is a matter,17
NA,which I shall have to consider.,17
NA,HOURS OF SITTING.,17
NA,NA,17
NA,tance of the discussion of the nnancial rela-,17
NA,tions of the Commonwealth and States,17
NA,"which is now taking place in this House,",17
NA,will the Prime Minister consider the ad-,17
NA,visableness of inviting honorable members,17
NA,to sit on Friday evenings?,17
Mr DEAKIN ,An y proposition for the,17
NA,extension of the hours of sitting during this,17
NA,session will be warmly welcomed by the,17
NA,"Government, and I hope the honorable",17
NA,member will be able to add other represen-,17
NA,tations to his own in order that we may,17
NA,take the earliest advantage of the sugges-,17
NA,tion.,17
Mr BATCHELOR ,I n considering the,17
NA,suggestion just made by the honorable mem-,17
NA,"ber for Echuca, will the Prime Minister",18
NA,"have regard to an alternative proposal,",18
NA,which would suit the convenience of a much,18
NA,"larger proportion of honorable members, following papers :-",18
NA,"namely, that we should meet on Wednesday",18
NA,and Thursday mornings?,18
Mr DEAKIN ,A n extension of the,18
NA,hours of sitting can be made only by im-,18
NA,posing increased difficulties and responsi-,18
NA,bility on certain honorable members. At,18
NA,"an early date, however, it will be necessary",18
NA,"to have morning sittings, but I hope, with",18
NA,"the assistance of the House, to avoid going",18
NA,further. I f it be necessary to sit later as,18
NA,"well as earlier, we must do so.",18
NA,PUBLIC SERVICE : MINIMUM,18
NA,WAGE.,18
Mr TUDOR ,Recentl y a return was,18
NA,"prepared to the order of the House, on a",18
NA,"motion submitted by myself, showing the",18
NA,number of adults in the Public Service of,18
NA,thc Commonwealth receiving less than the,18
NA,minimum wage. Will the Minister of Home,18
NA,Affairs make an effort to have the return,18
NA,prepared in a more intelligible form than,18
NA,that in which it has been submitted?,18
Mr FULLER ,Th e honorable member,18
NA,having called my attention to the nature of,18
NA,"the return, I caused it to be sent back to",18
NA,"the Public Service Commissioner, with a",18
NA,request that a further investigation be made,18
NA,with a view to setting out more clearly the,18
NA,information sought by the honorable mem-,18
NA,ber.,18
NA,FEDERAL CAPITAL SITE.,18
Mr HENRY WILLIS ,Ha s the atten.,18
NA,tion of the Minister of Home Affairs been,18
NA,called to a paragraph in this morning's news-,18
NA,papers stating that the Premier of New,18
NA,"South Wales, in the Legislative Assembly,",18
NA,yesterday took certain action in regard to,18
NA,the Federal Capital site? Has the honor-,18
NA,able gentleman any information on the sub-,18

NA,state when the next step will be taken by,18
NA,the Commonwealth Government to secure,18
NA,finality in the selection and location of the,18
NA,site of the Capital?,18
Mr FULLER , I have read the para-,18
NA,"graph in question, and can only say that the",18
NA,Government are extremely anxious that this,18
NA,important matter shall be dealt with with,18

NA,Debate resumed from 30th September,18
NA,"(vide page 4008), on motion by Mr.",18
NA,DEAKIN-,18
NA,That leave be given to bring in a Bill for an,18
NA,Act to alter the provisions of the Constitution,18
NA,relating to finance.,18
Mr COON ,Batman) [11.2] - I do not,18
NA,think I should be ashamed to confess that,18
NA,I rise with some diffidence to address my-,18
NA,self to this question. The fact that I,18
NA,"have been preceded by the Prime Minister,",18
NA,"the Treasurer, the honorable member for",18
NA,"Flinders, the honorable member for",18
NA,"Mernda, the honorable member for North",18
NA,"Sydney, the honorable member for Ken-",18
NA,"nedy, the honorable member for Wide",18
NA,"Bay, and last, but not least, the honorable",18
NA,"member for Darwin, makes my task all the",18
NA,"more difficult, and here I might add that",18
NA,I regret that I have not yet had the plea-,18
NA,sure of being able to read the honorable,18
NA,member for Darwin's speech. I wish to,18
NA,say at the outset that I intend to put my,18
NA,"own case in my own way, and from a lay-",18
NA,man's point of view. The honorable,18
NA,"member for Wakefield, a new member of",18
NA,"the House, delivered from this bench the",18
NA,other night a speech in which there was a,18
NA,"lot of force and energy, and by which he",18
NA,-,18
NA,made out a splendid case for a land tax.,18
NA,He said that our great necessity was land,18
NA,"settlement, that people were flocking from",18
NA,"the country to the cities, and that if this",18
NA,agreement were carried out it would be the,18
NA,"means of settling people upon the land, of",18
NA,"constructing more railways, and of ridding",18
NA,us of the unemployed difficulty. In this,18
NA,connexion it seems strange to reflect that in,18
NA,Victoria a few nights ago a candidate for,18
NA,a vacant seat in the State Parliament said,18
NA,that he was opposed to the land tax,18
NA,"proposed in this State, and that an easier",19
NA,way of getting the money was for the State,19
NA,to settle the people on the land and collect,19
NA,£ i 5s. per head from the Commonwealth.,19
NA,The honorable member for Wakefield also,19
NA,drew attention to the question of closer,19
NA,settlement. He asserted that what Aus-,19
NA,tralia wanted was more people in the,19
NA,"country districts, and that the cry should",19
NA,"be, "" From the cities to the lands.""",19
NA,"He told us that about 36 per cent,",19
NA,of the population of Australia lived in,19
NA,the crowded cities. The figures for the,19
NA,"various States are as follow :-Sydney ,",19
NA,"36 per cent, of the population of New",19
NA,"South Wales; Melbourne, 43 per cent of",19
NA,"the population of Victoria; Brisbane, 25",19
NA,"ptr cent, of the population of Queensland :",19
NA,"Adelaide, 45 per cent, of the population of",19
NA,South Australia-th e State from which the,19
NA,"honorable member comes; Perth, 19 per",19
NA,"cent, of the population of Western Aus-",19
NA,"tralia; and Hobart, 21 per cent, of the",19
NA,population of Tasmania.,19
Mr THOMAS BROWN ,"""H e made out a",19
NA,good case on those figures.,19
Mr COON ,Undoubtedl y he made out,19
NA,a good case in favour of getting the peonle,19
NA,"on to the land, and I quite agree with",19
NA,him. In Victoria there are 120 families,19
NA,"which own between them 6,000,000 acres,",19
NA,"and a short time ago, when the Victorian",19
NA,Government were desirous of purchasing,19
NA,"land for closer settlement, one estate was",19
NA,"offered to them for £1,000,000, although",19
NA,"it was rated at only £50,000. The only",19
NA,way to settle the people upon the land is,19
NA,"to impose a stiff land tax, and the",19
NA,only authority that can impose such,19
NA,a tax for the purpose of land settle-,19
NA,ment 5s the Commonwealth Parliament.,19
NA,The State Parliaments have utterly failed,19
NA,"to do so. Mr Watt, the Treasurer of",19
NA,"Victoria, in introducing his Land Tax Bill",19
NA,"recently, said that the purpose of the tax",19
NA,was not altogether to promote closer,19
NA,"ment, .but to produce revenue. While it is",19
NA,a very good thing to impose taxation in,19
NA,"order to obtain revenue from the land, I",19
NA,believe that a land tax should be so im-,19
NA,posed as to become the means of bursting,19
NA,up large estates. The figures for Victoria,19
NA,"according to Mr Watt, are as follow:",19
NA,There are on the land-tax register 405 es-,19
NA,"tates, each over £20,000 in capital value,",19
NA,"with a total value of £24,707,448, and a",19
NA,"taxable value of £5,748.213. Included",19
NA,"in those are 170 estates, each of over",19
NA,"£50,000 capital value, with an average",19
NA,"value of £105,021, a total value of",19
NA,"£ 7)853,675, and a taxable value of",19
NA,I,19
NA,"£4,337,413. Included in these are forty-",19
NA,"five estates each, over £100,000 in capital",19
NA,"value, with an average value of £158,899,",19
NA,"and a total value of £7,153,444. The",19
NA,total area of those forty-five holdings is,19
NA,"1,296,538 acres, and the average area is",19
NA,"28,812 acres. One man owns 81,348",19
NA,"acres, another 55,448 acres, and a third-",19
NA,"52,655 acres. Those estates are devoted",19
NA,"almost exclusively to grazing, and have little",19
NA,or no tillage upon them. Those are state-,19
NA,ments made by the Treasurer of Victoria,19
NA,when introducing his Land Tax Bill- a,19
NA,measure which he will have very little op-,19
NA,portunity of carrying if all the members,19
NA,of the State Parliament are of the same,19
NA,way of thinking as the candidate to whom,19
NA,I referred as being against the proposed,19
NA,"land tax, and in favour of getting the Com-",19
NA,monwealth to make up the State revenue,19
NA,by a per capita contribution of 25s. per,19
NA,annum.,19
Mr JOHN THOMSON ,I s the honorable,19
NA,member in favour of an improved or un-,19
NA,improved land value tax?,19
Mr COON ,Unimproved .,19
Mr JOHN THOMSON , The figures,19
NA,quoted represent improved values.,19
Mr COON , I am not sure upon that,19
NA,"point, but I want to make it clear that I",19
NA,favour taxing the land and settling the,19
NA,people upon it. Where one man owns at,19
NA,"present 80,000 acres, I would impose a",19
NA,tax sufficiently stiff to settle a few hun-,19
NA,"dred people on such an area, which at pre-",19
NA,"sent supports, perhaps, ten or a - dozen.",19
NA,That is the sort of taxation that I favour.,19
NA,While we have an area of something like,19
NA,"2,978,000 square miles, the great trouble",19
NA,is that the people cannot get upon the,19
NA,land. The only way to get them upon it,19
NA,"is to make the owners use it, or allow",19
NA,some one else to use it for them. Here,19
NA,"is a case in point: At Terang, a few miles",19
NA,"settlefrom Melbourne, there is some of the",19
NA,"richest land in Victoria, but this is the",19
NA,condition of affairs found to exist there by,19
NA,a gentleman who went there recently for,19
NA,the purpose of erecting a church-,19
NA,The people down there had not much accom-,19
NA,modation. I f they needed five rooms they gener-,19
NA,ally put up two. He would never forget a ride,19
NA,"he had. They had first to cross the creek, and",19
NA,"then climb a hillside, slipping every step or so,,",19
NA,for it was raining heavily; then they had to-,19
NA,zig-zag down the other side. I t took an hour,19
NA,and forty minutes to go those four miles. When-,19
NA,they reached Chapel Creek he found how the,19
NA,members of the farmer's family he was to stav,19
NA,"with came. The ""bush buggy"" was there; thev",19
NA,could not bring it across the creek. On week,19
NA,days it was used to take cream to the nearest,19
NA,"factory. I t was a sledge, and on i t was lashed",20
NA,a kerosene case; and on the kerosene case sat,20
NA,the farmer's wife. A big draught-horse was -,20
NA,"drawing the sledge, a boy was driving it, and",20
NA,"the daughter was walking ahead, carrying a",20
NA,"-candle in a bottle to show the way. He, on",20
NA,"horseback, followed them all.",20
NA,One of the first things that the States have,20
NA,to do is to impose a stiff land,20
NA,they do not do it I think this Parliament,20
NA,will do it for them. I believe,20
NA,-of every party in this House has declared,20
NA,in favour of a land tax. The right,20
NA,orable member for East Sydney has done,20
NA,so.,20
Mr JOHN THOMSON ,Whe n did,20
NA,so?,20
Mr COON ," Mr Watt, in introducing",20
NA,his Land Tax Bill in the State Parliament,20
NA,"-recently, stated that the right honorable",20
NA,member for East Sydney had declared,20
NA,if the States would not do their duty in,20
NA,direction the Federal Parliament would.,20
NA,He also said that the present Prime Ministhe,20
NA,ter and the honorable member for Wide,20
NA,"Bay had declared for a land tax, and",20
NA,asked whether the State Parliament was,20
NA,"going to do its duty, or leave the matter",20
NA,to the Commonwealth.,20
Mr MCWILLIAMS ,Tha t was a very,20
NA,"good "" whip "" !",20
Mr COON ,"Whethe r it was a ""whip",20
NA,"-or not, the day is coming when the States",20
NA,"will see the necessity for a land tax,",20
NA,we shall be placed in the proud position,20
NA,-of imposing one.,20
Mr JOHN THOMSON ,W e shall have,20
NA,job to do i t !,20
Mr COON , I do not think so; I berun,20
NA,lieve that at the next general election,20
NA,"people will declare for a land tax,",20
NA,they will tolerate no longer conditions,20
NA,"under which land is unobtainable, and there",20
NA,"are no less than 1,200 applicants for",20
NA,-eighty vacant blocks. The honorable,20
NA,member for Wakefield told us the General,20
NA,-other night that crowds of men are,20
NA,applying for positions in the Victorian,20
NA,"railway service, and that many of them",20
NA,.are from the country districts. We,20
NA,told that farmers' sons are leaving,20
NA,"-land, and it is clearly the duty of",20
NA,"State, and also the Commonwealth, to",20
NA,that people are afforded facilities for,20
NA,settlement under satisfactory conditions.,20
Mr ATKINSON ,Wil l a land tax result,20
NA,"""in settlement?",20
Mr COON , A land tax will give,20
NA,-people the opportunity which they do,20
NA,now possess of going on the land.,20
Mr ATKINSON , I thought the honor-,20
NA,able member said that the people were,20
NA,leaving the land?,20
Mr COON ,Tha t is because sufficient,20
NA,land is not available. The fact that 120,20
NA,"families own 6,000,000 acres in Victoria,",20
NA,shows what chance there is for an ordinary,20
NA,"tax, and i f person to obtain a block.",20
Mr ATKINSON ,I t all depends on the,20
NA,every leader quality of the land.,20
Mr COON , I am speaking of some of,20
NA,honthe best lands. The States have parted,20
NA,"with about 123,000,000 acres of Crown",20
NA,"lands, for which they have received an",20
NA,he do average price of £ 1 per acre.,20
Mr JOHN THOMSON ,Wher e does the,20
NA,honorable member get his figures?,20
Mr COON ,The y are the figures used,20
NA,by the Treasurer of Victoria when he in-,20
NA,that troduced his land tax proposals. When,20
NA,"that Federation was inaugurated, we were told",20
NA,that there would be a great reduction in,20
NA,"expenditure of the States, and in the",20
NA,membership of the State Parliaments. As,20
NA,"a matter of fact, the Commonwealth, with",20
NA,"a population of 4,275,000, and 2,109,562",20
NA,"electors, has 633 members of Parliament.",20
NA,There is a member of Parliament for every,20
NA,"6,000 people, a Minister of the Crown for",20
NA,"every 73,000, and a representative of the",20
NA,"King for every 579,000. The Governors",20
NA,""" of Australia cost £59,000 annually; and",20
NA,I quote these figures simply because the,20
NA,_ or people voted for Federation on the under-,20
NA,standing that the expenditure would be re-,20
NA,"duced. The Agents-General cost £24,000",20
NA,"a per annum, and I suppose that the ap-",20
NA,pointment of the High Commissioner will,20
NA,"that amount up to £40,000 or £50,000,",20
NA,the though it was clearly understood that the,20
NA,because High Commissioner would act for the,20
NA,whole of the States. For the present,20
NA,state of affairs the Commonwealth Parlia-,20
NA,"ment cannot be blamed, seeing that we have",20
NA,not the power to dispense with the Agents-,20
NA,"of the States; and, under the cir -",20
NA,"cumstances, I am justified in urging that",20
NA,the States have not reduced their,20
NA,-expenditure to the extent anticipated. I,20
NA,are am one who believes that the railways,20
NA,the should be controlled by the Common-,20
NA,the wealth. A lengthy debate took place,20
NA,see on this question at the Adelaide Federal,20
NA,"Convention, and a number of the speakers",20
NA,took the same view. I f we are to develop,20
NA,Australia in the way it should be de-,20
NA,"veloped, this Parliament must have control",20
NA,"the of the railways, the lands, the mines,",20
NA,not and education. A Select Committee of,20
NA,the State Parliament of Victoria some,20
NA,years ago recommended that a Federal,21
NA,"Parliament, when it came into existence,",21
NA,"should have jurisdiction over the land, the",21
NA,"railways, and the mines; and certainly, i f",21
NA,"we are to control our trade, and make",21
NA,"our own goods, it is absolutely necessary",21
NA,to have our people technically educated.,21
NA,In the city of Melbourne there are be-,21
NA,"tween 33,000 and 36,000 boys and girls",21
NA,"from fourteen to eighteen years of age,",21
NA,and of that number only 900 are receiving,21
NA,any technical education. We can prosper,21
NA,"only by having efficient workmen, and, to",21
NA,"that end, our young people should be",21
NA,thoroughly trained; and I venture to say,21
NA,that in this connexion the States are not,21
NA,doing their duty. It has been stated by,21
NA,more than one honorable member that this,21
NA,is not a fiscal question-no t a question of,21
NA,Protection or Free Trade. The honorable,21
NA,member for North Sydney said that we,21
NA,"could increase our Tariff, or maintain the",21
NA,"present Tariff of £ 2 ios. per head, with-",21
NA,out in any way interfering with its pro-,21
NA,tective incidence; but I have the temerity,21
NA,to disagree with that view. I f the revenue,21
NA,"is to decrease, it must ibe on the side of the cent., £29,000; matches,",21
NA,"protective duties, for we can raise addi-",21
NA,tional monev through the Customs only by,21
NA,"revenue duties, which f a l l on the masses.",21
NA,At the present time it is clear that the,21
NA,"importer is paying the duty, as is shown",21
NA,"by the fact that when, for a short time,",21
NA,"there was a duty on wire netting, and a",21
NA,"revenue of £18,000 was received by the",21
NA,"Commonwealth, the price of the com-",21
NA,modity was reduced. Who paid the duty?,21
NA,"The importer, undoubtedly.",21
Mr BAMFORD ,Doe s the honorable,21
NA,member not think that the consumer paid,21
NA,the duty ?,21
Mr COON ,Th e honorable member,21
NA,for Echuca challenged the statement I have,21
NA,"made, though I do not quite know on what",21
NA,"grounds; but I am certain of the fact that,",21
NA,"while the duty was in operation, the price",21
NA,of wire netting was reduced for the pur-,21
NA,pose of trying to crush out competition in,21
NA,New South Wales.,21
NA,NA,21
NA,wire netting paid more for the commodity.,21
Mr COON ,The y may have had to,21
NA,"pay more for some wire netting, but the",21
NA,price in New South Wales was reduced,21
NA,while the duty was in operation.,21
NA,revenue from Customs and Excise in,21
NA,"1908-9 was £10,843,900, or £ 2 8s. 6d. per",21
NA,head; and we have to ask ourselves where,21
NA,that revenue came from? Did it come,21
NA,"from the revenue duties, or from the pro-",21
NA,tective duties?,21
Mr MCDONALD ,Th e revenue duties.,21
Mr COON ,Di d it? Ready-made,21
NA,clothing with a duty of 35 per cent -,21
NA,"which ,is clearly not a revenue duty-",21
NA,"produced £447,000. This clothing is",21
NA,"made in the sweating dens of London,",21
NA,where women work from morning to night,21
NA,under conditions which the House of Com-,21
NA,mons has said should not be permitted to,21
NA,"continue, and to cope with which the",21
NA,House of Lords has approved of Wages,21
NA,Boards on the lines of those instituted at the,21
NA,"instance of the present Prime Minister, when",21
NA,in the State Parliament of Victoria. Fur-,21
NA,"niture, with a duty of 35 per cent., pro-",21
NA,"duced £57,000; boots and shoes produced",21
NA,"£60,000; hats and caps, £112,000; sta-",21
NA,"tionery, with a duty of 25 per cent.,",21
NA,"£60,000; metals and machinery, at 25",21
NA,"per cent., £140,000; glassware, at 10",21
NA,"per cent., £96,000; bolts and nuts, at",21
NA,"20 per cent., £90,000; cement, at is. a",21
NA,"cwt., £60,000; twine, at 25 per cent.,",21
NA,"£ 5 > ° ; motive machinery, at 20 per",21
NA,2 0 0,21
NA,"£97,000;",21
NA,"pianos, £72,000; mining machinery, at",21
NA,"20 per cent., £20,000; electrical ma-",21
NA,"chinery, at 20 per cent., £22,000;",21
NA,"earthenware, at 25 per cent., £37,000;",21
NA,"and confectionery, at 2jd. per lb.,",21
NA,"£50,000; making a total of £2,564,640.",21
Mr MCDONALD ,Th e revenue from the,21
NA,articles just named will decrease as the,21
NA,import duties become more effective.,21
Mr COON , I shall endeavour to,21
NA,show that it will disappear. To sum-,21
NA,marize the figures which I have just,21
NA,"given, one line, on which the duty is 35",21
NA,"per cent, and 30 per cent., returns",21
NA,"£447,800; five, at 30 per cent., return",21
NA,"£165,000; ten, at 25 per cent., return",21
NA,"£398,000; twelve, at 20 per cent., return",21
NA,"£505,000; one, at 17J per cent., returns",21
NA,"£72,000; one, i t 15 per cent., returns",21
NA,"£25,000; one, at 12J per cent., returns",21
NA,"£22,000; and two, at 10 per cent, return",21
NA,"£119,000. From miscellaneous duties we",21
NA,"get £810,198, making a grand total of",21
NA,"£2,564,640. Ready-made clothing is duti-",21
NA,"able at 35 per cent, and 30 per cent. I n",21
NA,the Old Country some of the women em-,21
NA,ployed in making such clothing receive,21
NA,only 6s. a -week; girls are paid only,21
NA,"The 2s. 6d. a dozen for making night-dresses,",21
NA,and fined 2s. each for damaging them. For,21
NA,making blouses they are paid 8d. per,21
NA,"dozen, and have to pay 4s. 6d. for any",21
NA,garment that may be damaged. I t is the,21
NA,importation of clothing made under such,22
NA,conditions that is swelling our Customs re-,22
NA,venue. I do not think that honorable,22
NA,members desire that women and girls shall,22
NA,be sweated in order that our Customs re-,22
NA,turns may be high. From the duty on,22
NA,"pianos we have received from £72,000 to",22
NA,"£74,000 per annum, but since the imposi-",22
NA,tion of the duty a factory has been estab-,22
NA,"lished in Victoria. I f 30 per cent, is not",22
NA,a sufficiently high rate to keep out im-,22
NA,"ported pianos, we should do as they do in",22
NA,Japan-increas e it to 60 per cent.,22
Mr DUGALD THOMSON ,I t would be,22
NA,better to declare that pianos shall not be,22
NA,imported.,22
Mr COON , I should be prepared to,22
NA,prohibit the importation of pianos while,22
NA,we have men walking about looking for,22
NA,employment. Those who require pianos,22
NA,should buy the Australian article. Why,22
NA,"should our people, by purchasing imported",22
NA,"goods, send money out of the country?",22
NA,From the duties on iron and steel we re-,22
NA,"ceive ,£72,000 a year, notwithstanding that",22
NA,we grant bounties for the production of,22
NA,iron and steel. I f the importation is to,22
NA,"continue, the bounty will be wasted. I t",22
NA,will be useless under such circumstances to,22
NA,"spend £150,000 in trying to encourage the",22
NA,industry. We have also offered a bounty,22
NA,"for tops, to encourage wool-combing for ex-",22
NA,"port, and bounties to encourage other in-",22
NA,dustries. A ll the goods from which the,22
NA,revenue to which. I have just referred is,22
NA,"now obtained will, within ten years, be",22
NA,made within the Commonwealth. In justi-,22
NA,"fication for that statement, I would men-",22
NA,"tion the fact that Mr Jeffery, whom the",22
NA,Board of Trade sent to Australia in 1905,22
NA,to inquire why Great Britain was losing,22
NA,"business here, reported that we should",22
NA,never be able to manufacture our own,22
NA,"matches, because rates of wages here were",22
NA,"too high, and hours of labour too short.",22
Mr DUGALD THOMSON ,Ther e was a,22
NA,match factory here at the time.,22
Mr COON ,I t was not in a satisfactory,22
NA,"condition, and we were still importing",22
NA,"matches, because the duty was not sufficient",22
NA,to keep out foreign-made matches.,22
NA,"present we are obtaining £97,000 a year",22
NA,from the duty on matches. But an up-to-,22
NA,"date factory has recently been erected, at a",22
NA,"cost of £14,000, and it is expected that the",22
NA,matches made there will compete success-,22
NA,"fully again&t the imported article. Now,",22
NA,"in the Old Country, women get 2^d. a",22
NA,gross for making match-boxes in their own,22
NA,"homes, and, working ten or twelve hours a",22
NA,"day, they earn 3s. or 4s. a week. I f we",22
NA,can shut out the production of such cheap,22
NA,"labour, surely we can successfully manu-",22
NA,"facture our own clothing, confectionery,",22
NA,"twine, glassware and earthenware. The",22
NA,proposal to pay 25s. per capita is based on,22
NA,the assumption that the Tariff will continue,22
NA,to produce £ 2 8s. 6d. per head. But i f,22
NA,the revenue from the articles which I have,22
NA,mentioned is deducted from the total re-,22
NA,"turns, the yield per head will be reduced",22
NA,to £ 1 19s. 8d. A Commission appointed,22
NA,"by Mr Justice Isaacs, when Acting Pre-",22
NA,"mier of Victoria, reported that a Protective",22
NA,Tariff might be expected to yield about,22
NA,"£ 2 per head, which is practically the same",22
NA,"figure. During the last seven years, the",22
NA,return from the Commonwealth Tariff .has,22
NA,"been about £ 1 16s. 3d. per head. I f , in",22
NA,"the future, it amounts to £ 1 19s. 8d. per",22
NA,"head, and the States receive £ 1 5s. of",22
NA,"that, 14s. 8d. will be left for Common-",22
NA,"wealth expenditure, or 2s. per head more",22
NA,than we get now. But the Commonwealth,22
NA,"liabilities will greatly increase. Therefore,",22
NA,although I do not say that the proposed ar-,22
NA,rangement would make it impossible to con-,22
NA,"tinue a Protective Tariff, I say that that",22
NA,"would be its tendency, should it be made",22
NA,permanent. I f our Tariff gives the same,22
NA,amount of Protection as is given bv the,22
NA,"Tariffs of the United States and Japan, we",22
NA,"shall lose at least £2,564,640 of",22
NA,revenue which we now levy by means,22
NA,of import duties. The money will,22
NA,have to be found in some ether way.,22
NA,Of the 450 items in the Tariff only,22
NA,200 are at present producing revenue.,22
NA,"There are 250 items on the free list, and",22
NA,more than one statesman and writer has,22
NA,"urged that it is impossible, with such a",22
NA,"large free list, for the present Customs and",22
NA,"Excise revenue of the Commonwealth, to be",22
NA,maintained. There are 750 items in the,22
NA,"Canadian Tariff, of which only 232 are on",22
NA,the free list. Under the Commonwealth,22
NA,Tariff we impose on boots and shoes duties,22
NA,"ranging up to 30 per cent. Japan, on the",22
NA,"other hand, imposes duties on boots and",22
NA,"shoes, shirts, and musical instruments, rang-",22
NA,"ing as high as 40 per cent., and on um-",22
NA,At brellas duties as high as 50 per cent. The,22
NA,"average of our Tariff, so far as the Pro-",22
NA,"tective itemsare concerned, is about 30",22
NA,"per cent., as against 33 per cent, in the",22
NA,"case of New Zealand and 44 per cent, in",22
NA,the case of the United States. How can,22
NA,"Australia, with a population of 4,275,000,",22
NA,compete with a nation with a population,22
NA,"of 90,000,000, which possesses a Tariff",22
NA,"averaging 14 per cent, higher than her own",23
NA,The Commonwealth Tariff must be inimmigration.,23
NA,creased if we are to retain our present,23
NA,tion. The fact that we are able in respect,23
NA,of certain items bearing duties of 35 per,23
NA,"cent., to collect a revenue of £ 4 7 5 ,",23
NA,should satisfy honorable members either,23
NA,that the Protection granted is not high,23
NA,enough or that the local industries to,23
NA,they relate have not yet been sufficiently,23
NA,established. I come now to the question,23
NA,preferential trade. In connexion with the,23
NA,visit to Australia of representatives,23
NA,"Chambers of Commerce from the Old wealth,",23
NA,"Country, a number of importers, in Sydney,",23
NA,were interviewed with reference to the 5 labourers.,23
NA,"per cent, preferential duty in favour",23
NA,"Great Britain, and the general consensus",23
NA,opinion was th'at it was too low. I t was,23
NA,"urged that a preference of 10 per cent.,",23
NA,"and in some cases of 20 per cent, was necesin",23
NA,sary. As scon as we granted a preference,23
NA,"of 5 per cent, on British goods, German",23
NA,manufacturers made a corresponding reducrespect,23
NA,tion in the prices of their manufactures,23
NA,"Australian buyers, and in that way the mayoral term.",23
NA,preference granted to the Old Country,23
NA,been nullified. I maintain that we are,23
NA,in a position at present to reduce our duties,23
NA,in order to increase the preference granted,23
NA,to Great Britain.,23
Mr MAUGER ,VV e could increase the,23
NA,preference by raising the duties against,23
NA,foreign imports.,23
Mr COON , I agree with the honorable,23
NA,"member that that could be done, but as",23
NA,showing that we have already granted a,23
NA,"substantial preference to Great Britain,",23
NA,would point out that i f the duties collected,23
NA,on imports from the Old Country last year,23
NA,had been the same as those collected on,23
NA,"ports from foreign countries, an additional",23
NA,"sum of £740,000 would have been raised.",23
NA,"In other words, the preference granted to",23
NA,British imports amounted last year to,23
NA,"£740,000. I f , at the next general election",23
NA,"there is returned to this Parliament,",23
NA,jority in favour of granting an increased,23
NA,"ference to British goods, there will be a",23
NA,"ther reduction in our Customs revenue, and,",23
NA,taking into consideration what may happen,23
NA,in the future I do not think we should be,23
NA,justified in tying up the Commonwealth for,23
NA,all time to this agreement. I f a majority,23
NA,were returned at the next general election,23
NA,in favour of extending a greater prefergreat,23
NA,"ence to imports from Great Britain, the",23
NA,"sult would be, under this agreement, an",23
NA,crease of taxation paid by those least able for all time,23
NA,to bear it. In dealing vvith this,23
NA,? must also have regard to the question of,23
NA,"During the last six years,",23
NA,"posi1,232,000 persons have entered Canada,",23
NA,and when the Prime Minister was in Eng-,23
NA,"land, he strongly advocated not only pre-",23
NA,0 0 0,23
NA,"ferential trade, but the settlement of our",23
NA,empty spaces by British immigrants. Under,23
NA,this agreement we should have to pay to the,23
NA,"which States, 25s. in respect of every new",23
NA,"arrival, and we should also have to",23
NA,of make that payment in respect of the,23
NA,natural increase in population. Last year,23
NA,"of there were 111,545 births in the Common-",23
NA,and it is interesting to note that,23
NA,"the fathers of 17,046 of these were",23
NA,Under this agreement every-,23
NA,of one of those children of labourers w&uld,23
NA,of have to bear taxation through the Customs,23
NA,to the extent of £ 1 5s. per head. I have,23
NA,heard of countries where a bonus is granted,23
NA,respect of every increase in a man's,23
NA,family. I have heard of the mayor of a,23
NA,city who decided to give a bonus of £ 1 in,23
NA,"of every child, twelve months of",23
NA,"to age, brought before him at the end of his",23
Mr DUGALD THOMSON ,Th e honorable,23
NA,not member does not mean that we shall have,23
NA,to pay to the States 25s. in respect of every-,23
NA,one of the children born. He must deduct,23
NA,the deaths from the births.,23
NA,Mi;.. COON -M y point is that we,23
NA,should have to pay that amount in respect,23
NA,of every child that survived. I t is a dis-,23
NA,"grace to the Commonwealth that, accord-",23
NA,"ing to an undoubted authority, every year",23
NA,"3,000 infants, whose lives could be saved,",23
NA,I die before reaching the age of twelve,23
NA,months. That statement was made by Dr,23
NA,"Dunbar Hooper, who represented the Com-",23
NA,immonwealth at the recent convention held in,23
NA,"Brussels. He declared that 8,000 children",23
NA,under the age of twelve months die annu-,23
NA,"ally in the Commonwealth, and that of that",23
NA,"number the lives of 3,000 could be saved.",23
NA,"Last year, as I have said, 111,545 children",23
NA,a mawere born in the Commonwealth. The,23
NA,"preparents of 32,000 were engaged in the pas-",23
NA,furtoral and mining industry; the fathers of,23
NA,"40,000 belonging to the labouring and indus-",23
NA,"trial classes, and only 140 were of indepen-",23
NA,dent means. Whilst I believe that the States,23
NA,"should be treated with some consideration,",23
NA,I am not in favour of this agreement being,23
NA,fixed for all time. I am confident that the,23
NA,masses of the people do not believe,23
NA,"rein it, and will not indorse it. I f we are",23
NA,into put this provision in the Constitution,23
Mr MAUGER ,W e cannot.,23
Mr COON ,"W e cannot, but i f we say",24
NA,"that, while making it ostensibly a per-",24
NA,"manent provision, we expect the people to",24
NA,"afterwards remove it, we shall be asking",24
NA,the people to do something that we do not,24
NA,believe in. We should not take any such,24
NA,course. I f I thought that this was a,24
NA,"good provision, and should be retained in",24
NA,"the Constitution, it would be my duty to",24
NA,"vote to make it binding for all time, and",24
NA,"to ask the people who sent me here, and",24
NA,whose suffrages I should be seeking in the,24
NA,"future, to vote for me because I was in",24
NA,favour of it for all time. But I ' have no,24
NA,right to disfranchise the people I represent,24
NA,by casting in this House a yote which I,24
NA,"do not believe in, and* which I do not",24
NA,"think they believe in. That being so,",24
NA,while I am prepared to give the States,24
NA,"every consideration, I cannot forget that",24
NA,the people who return the members of the,24
NA,"State Parliaments, and the people who re-",24
NA,"turn the members of this Parliament, are",24
NA,one and the same. I t is for them to say,24
NA,"that, where the States have been extra-",24
NA,"vagant in the past, that extravagance must",24
NA,cease. I f they decide that there must,24
NA,be one member of Parliament for every,24
NA,"6,000 inhabitants, a Minister of the Crown",24
NA,"for every 73,000, and a Governor for",24
NA,"every 500,000, that is their business.",24
NA,"Speaking as a member of this Parliament,",24
NA,I hold that the States should do their,24
NA,"duty, and, i f they do, I venture to say",24
NA,that the Commonwealth Parliament will,24
NA,also do its duty. I f the States and the,24
NA,"Commonwealth work hand in hand, as they",24
NA,"should, I believe there is a great future",24
NA,"for Australia. While that is so, we must",24
NA,"safeguard, at all hazards, the 257,000",24
NA,persons who are engaged in our manufac-,24
NA,turing industries. While the States have,24
NA,"the control of the lands, it is their duty",24
NA,"to promote land settlement, and i f they",24
NA,"fail in that direction, it will be the duty",24
NA,of this Parliament to undertake it.,24
NA,venture to say that we have dpne our share,24
NA,in finding employment for the people .of,24
NA,the Commonwealth in the factories and,24
NA,workshops throughout Australia. As we,24
NA,"have done our part, I trust that the States",24
NA,"will do theirs, by seeing that the vast",24
NA,areas of Australia are filled with men and,24
NA,"women able and willing to work, because",24
NA,such a policy must be in the interests of,24
NA,the whole of the people of the Common-,24
NA,wealth.,24
NA,Mr .FOWLER (Perth) [12.4] - I think,24
NA,T may congratulate the House on the high,24
NA,"tone, as a whole, of the debate which has",24
NA,taken place upon this important question.,24
NA,Some of the speeches might with advan-,24
NA,"tage have been considerably curtailed, but",24
NA,nevertheless I have been very pleased to,24
NA,sit here during the days upon which the,24
NA,"debate has proceeded, and have been un-",24
NA,able to refrain from contrasting favorably,24
NA,the House and its attitude towards this,24
NA,"large public question, with what transpired",24
NA,too frequently during the previous part of,24
NA,this session.,24
Mr WILKS , A reminiscence of the early,24
NA,days of Federation.,24
Mr FOWLER,"I t is, undoubtedly,",24
NA,reminiscent of the early days of the Fede-,24
NA,ration to hear a question like this discussed,24
NA,"so earnestly and with so much ability,",24
NA,"and, I am pleased to be able to add, with-",24
NA,out so much of the purely party aspecf,24
NA,that we have sometimes had. There are,24
NA,"only two points which I wish to discuss,",24
NA,and which have not been dealt with in,24
NA,this debate up to the present. The one,24
NA,note during this debate which has seemed,24
NA,to me to ring somewhat hollow is the crv,24
NA,that some members of this House are sacri-,24
NA,"ficing "" national interests "" to some less im-",24
NA,portant State interests. The cry of,24
NA,""" Nationalism "" is found to rest on a very",24
NA,"slight basis, when we inquire into the rela-",24
NA,tive positions of the State and Federal Par-,24
NA,liaments. I deny that the great Common-,24
NA,wealth Parliament is any more National,24
NA,than is the sum total of the State Parlia-,24
NA,ments. I would remind honorable mem-,24
NA,bers that throughout the discussion in,24
NA,the States of the question of Federation,24
NA,the fact was never lost sight of that we,24
NA,"were to have a Federation, not only of thc",24
NA,"peoples, but also of the States of Australia.",24
NA,In every phase of the extensive and able,24
NA,dehates upon the Federal question one can,24
NA,see how fully and earnestly the matter of,24
NA,the conservation of the duties and rights of,24
NA,the States was intended to be provided for,24
NA,I in the Federal compact. I have heard a,24
NA,good deal about the predominant position of,24
NA,"the Canadian National Parliament, as it",24
NA,"is called, in contrast with the powers of the",24
NA,Parliaments of the Provinces. I have,24
NA,heard honorable members express regret,24
NA,that this Parliament has not been endowed,24
NA,with what they choose to call the same,24
NA,national powers as are possessed by the,24
NA,Parliament of the Dominion of Canada.,24
NA,I f they take the trouble to look up the Act:,24
NA,which brought that Dominion Parliament,24
NA,"into existence, and compare the list of",24
NA,functions apportioned to it with those,24
NA,apportioned to the Parliaments of the,24
NA,"Provinces, they will find that substantially",25
NA,there was made in that great part of the,25
NA,Empire the same re-arrangement as has been,25
NA,made in Australia. There is undoubtedly,25
NA,"the one difference, that the Dominion Parbounds,",25
NA,liament has under its control all powers,25
NA,"directly handed over to the Provinces,",25
NA,whereas the Commonwealth Parliament has,25
NA,only the powers specifically handed over,25
NA,"to it by the States. In other words,",25
NA,"position is reversed, but in both cases there",25
NA,"was, in the minds of those responsible",25
NA,"the creation of the two central bodies,",25
NA,recognition of the same common-sense with,25
NA,"principle. What ruled their minds,",25
NA,determined their allocation of duties and,25
NA,"functions, was simply a question of common",25
NA,sense. They asked themselves what duties,25
NA,could be best performed by a centralized,25
NA,"authority, and what by the States or",25
NA,vinces. That was the problem that they such,25
NA,"endeavoured to solve, and the framers of population",25
NA,"our Constitution most emphatically decided small; but, of",25
NA,it apart from any question of creating,25
NA,"""Imperial'' Parliament for Australia. They",25
NA,settled it purely and simply on a utilitarian,25
NA,"basis, having due regard to what appeared",25
NA,to them to be the capacity of the Commonfrom,25
NA,"wealth Parliament for certain functions,",25
NA,and the corresponding ability of the State,25
NA,Parliaments to carry out other duties.,25
NA,would remind honorable members that when,25
NA,the Federal Convention had finished its,25
NA,"work, there were very many Democratic",25
NA,members of the Australian community who,25
NA,denounced the result as contrary to the best,25
NA,interests of the Democracy. They had a,25
NA,wholesome objection to that centralization,25
NA,of power which is undoubtedly anti-Demoin,25
NA,cratic. They regarded such powers as,25
NA,were handed to the Federal Parliament as,25
NA,"tending in an undemocratic direction,",25
NA,they consequently opposed the' Federal facts,25
NA,Constitution as it was put before the people.,25
NA,"There is no doubt that, with perhaps the",25
NA,single exception of centralization for,25
NA,"fence purposes, the peoples of civilized",25
NA,munities show an increasing inclination,25
NA,decentralize. Honorable members who remuch,25
NA,present Victoria should not forget that,25
NA,objection urged in the early days against,25
NA,"the government of the Port Phillip settletion,",25
NA,ment by the New South Wales authorities,25
NA,"was, from a Democratic stand-point, well",25
NA,"founded. It was said then, with a great",25
NA,"deal of force, that certain functions carried",25
NA,out by that remote Government in New,25
NA,South Wales could be much better perfor,25
NA,formed by the people of the Port Phillip,25
NA,settlement themselves. A separation took,25
NA,"place, and the supreme control of their",25
NA,Mr Fowler*,25
NA,own affairs was granted by the Imperial,25
NA,authorities to the people of Port Phillip.,25
NA,"From that time, the development of Vic-",25
NA,toria undoubtedly went on by leaps and,25
NA,"and the people of that State found,",25
NA,not until the defence problem became of such,25
NA,"supreme importance, that very little objec-",25
NA,tion could be taken to the decentralizing in-,25
NA,fluence which had given them the control of,25
NA,the their own territory. We hear a great deal,25
NA,about the fact that Australia has no fewer,25
NA,"for than seven Parliaments, and some honor-",25
NA,"a able members go so far as to wish that,",25
NA,"the exception of this Parliament, they",25
NA,and were all wiped out. But i f any one con-,25
NA,siders the tremendous distances that sepa-,25
NA,"rate the various, parts of Australia, he",25
NA,"will, I think, begin to realize that",25
NA,even seven Parliaments are by no,25
NA,Promeans an excessive number to control,25
NA,a vast geographical region.,25
NA,"Of course, one may be reminded that the",25
NA,Australia is comparatively,25
NA,an so much a matter ofI contend,25
NA,"again, that it is not",25
NA,population as of area,25
NA,or of geographical separation of one part,25
NA,of this island continent from another. The,25
NA,"population of Port Phillip, when separation",25
NA,New South Wales was demanded and,25
NA,"obtained, was comparatively insignificant,",25
NA,but that was regarded as no obstacle; and,25
NA,1 I say without hesitation that any one who,25
NA,"looks at the huge area of Australia, and the",25
NA,geographical separation of certain parts of,25
NA,"the continent, must realize that the State",25
NA,"Parliaments, although they control, nomi-",25
NA,"nally, only a handful of people, have func-",25
NA,tions that cannot be performed as well by,25
NA,"any centralized authority. We have, room",25
NA,Australia for twenty-five TJnited King-,25
NA,doms ; and in my own State there is an area,25
NA,equivalent to half-a-dozen average European,25
NA,"and Kingdoms. Any one who looks, at such",25
NA,"as these will, I think, hesitate to say",25
NA,"that, while it is quite proper there.should",25
NA,be a central authority to deal with trade,25
NA,"deand commerce, and so forth, the functions",25
NA,comof the State Parliaments cannot be carried,25
NA,to oiit by them in their respective spheres,25
NA,better than they could be carried out,25
NA,the by us. I am glad to be able to compliment,25
NA,the Ministry on having dealt with this ques-,25
NA,"as it appears to me, in that broad,",25
NA,general spirit required in such a crisis in.,25
NA,the history of Australia. Here we have,25
NA,no question affecting one or two particular,25
NA,"States, but one affecting the welfare and",25
NA,"development of the whole of Australia. I ,",25
NA,"one, intend to give hearty support to the",25
NA,proposals of the Government. I realize,25
NA,"that the proposals, as they stand, cannot be",25
NA,interfered with without seriously injuring,26
NA,the possibility of a settlement with the,26
NA,States. We have an understanding between,26
NA,"two parties; and if we, on the one hand,",26
NA,"interfere with it, it stands to reason",26
NA,that the other side may have some,26
NA,hesitation in accepting any changes we,26
NA,"may make. On the whole, it seems",26
NA,"to me that, with the years of ex-",26
NA,"perience behind us, the Government pro-",26
NA,posals meet the situation in Australia; and,26
NA,"the provision made for the future is,",26
NA,"humanly speaking, as well thought out as",26
NA,any such provision could possibly be.,26
NA,"Another phase of the question, with which I",26
NA,"desire to deal very briefly, more particu-",26
NA,larly affects my own State. An impression,26
NA,has been sedulously fostered in certain,26
NA,"quarters that Western Australia, in parti-",26
NA,"cular, in supporting, as I believe it does",26
NA,through the length and breadth of its vast,26
NA,"area, the proposals of the Government, is",26
NA,very selfishly doing so in order to obviate,26
NA,other taxation of a. State character. There,26
NA,is no doubt that up to the present time,26
NA,Western Australia has suffered consider-,26
NA,ably financially from the effects of Federa-,26
NA,tion. While some members of this House,26
NA,have suggested that Western Australia,26
NA,"comes to the other States, and to the Com-",26
NA,"monwealth Parliament, in the attitude of a",26
NA,"mendicant, I am glad that such a view is",26
NA,not general. I t is a view which was re-,26
NA,pudiated by those who gave special con-,26
NA,sideration to the-circumstances of Western,26
NA,"Australia when drawing up the Constitution,",26
NA,"and who now, under the present arrange-",26
NA,"ment, seek to continue that con-",26
NA,sideration. In both cases it is ad-,26
NA,mitted by those who have gone into the,26
NA,question that the sliding scale provided for,26
NA,"Western Australia was only an equivalent,",26
NA,"and not an absolute equivalent, for the",26
NA,losses she sustained by entering the Federal,26
NA,"compact. I t is also admitted, in the arrange-",26
NA,"ment we are asked to seal, that Western",26
NA,"Australia is fully entitled, as a matter",26
NA,"of justice and equity, to special considera-",26
NA,"tion, in view-an d I quote the phraseology",26
NA,of the memorandum-o f the large contri-,26
NA,bution to the Customs revenue -per cafita,26
NA,made by that State. We undoubtedly re-,26
NA,quire all the money we can get in Western,26
NA,Australia for our local development. West-,26
NA,ern Australia has been behind the other,26
NA,States in obtaining that inflow of capital,26
NA,and of humanity without which no new,26
NA,"country can progress. We have, as I have",26
NA,"already said, suffered severely in our de-",26
NA,velopment by reason of the steadily decreas-,26
NA,ing amount of money available for us under,26
NA,Federal conditions. The State has done,26
NA,all in her power - all that she can,26
NA,reasonably be expected to do - to,26
NA,supplement by local taxation the shortage,26
NA,of revenue from Federal sources. The,26
NA,fact is-an d may come as a surprise to,26
NA,many honorable members-tha t the total,26
NA,revenue of Western Australia per head,26
NA,through direct taxation is not less than £ 1,26
NA,"is. 3d., as compared with an average of",26
NA,17s. 2d. for the whole of the Common-,26
NA,"wealth. Western Australia is, I think,",26
NA,second only to Tasmania in the thorough-,26
NA,ness with which it has applied the prin-,26
NA,ciples of direct taxation. In view of the,26
NA,"rudimentary character of our development,",26
NA,I contend that the taxation of this charac-,26
NA,ter imposed in Western Australia is even,26
NA,"greater, relatively, than that of any of the-",26
NA,"other part of the Commonwealth.' That,",26
NA,"I think, is a fairly sufficient reply to those",26
NA,"who contend that Western Australia, in",26
NA,order to make up the shortage of Federal,26
NA,"revenue, ought to tax herself still more.",26
NA,In that State there is a land tax of id. in,26
NA,"the £ i , an income tax of 4d. in the £ 1",26
NA,"on incomes over £200, a dividend tax of",26
NA,"id._ in the £ i for all companies, stamp",26
NA,"duties, and totalizator duties; and in view",26
NA,of a list of that kind the charge of not,26
NA,having sufficiently contributed from local,26
NA,resources is totally and absolutely un-,26
NA,founded.,26
Sir PHILIP FYSH ,Ar e there probate,26
NA,duties in Western Australia?,26
Mr FOWLER ,Not up to the present;,26
NA,the large - fortunes of Western Australia,26
NA,have not yet developed-they are in fosse,26
NA,and not in esse.,26
NA,NA,26
NA,there are young.,26
Mr FOWLER ,An d doubtless their,26
NA,fortunes will increase with increasing years.,26
NA,I sincerely hope that in Western Australia,26
NA,there will be none of those great fortunes,26
NA,which characterize particularly the land,26
NA,"magnates of the other States, but the people",26
NA,there may look forward to competence and,26
NA,"independence as the result of energy, in-",26
NA,"dustry, and thrift, as is being proved",26
NA,every day of our existence. I f Western,26
NA,Australia places 100 settlers on the land,26
NA,through the exercise of the functions of,26
NA,"the State Parliament, that is as much a",26
NA,step in the direction of national welfare,26
NA,and development as the creation of an in-,26
NA,dustry in Melbourne by means of a high,26
NA,"Protective duty. In regard to settlement,",26
NA,the State Parliaments have a national duty,26
NA,"to perform- a duty which, with the",27
NA,"exception of defence, transcends any,",27
NA,"I think, that lie before us in this",27
NA,Parliament. So long as the power of,27
NA,dealing with the land is left in the,27
NA,"hands of the State Parliaments, so long",27
NA,are they entitledto be regarded as,27
NA,"national in their character, quite as much",27
NA,as is the Parliament in which we have the,27
NA,honour to sit. I hope that the proposed,27
NA,"arrangement will be carried. I t will, I be-",27
NA,"lieve, be the means of giving the States a",27
NA,solidarity in their financial relations that,27
NA,will enable them to carry on effectively,27
NA,their work of development. I f that be,27
NA,"done, and i f we can settle thousands where",27
NA,"none are at present, the Commonwealth,",27
NA,"through the Customs, will be given an in-",27
NA,creased revenue that I feel sure will sup-,27
NA,ply the whole of our requirements for an,27
NA,indefinite period to come.,27
NA,NA,27
NA,"Prime Minister, in opening this important",27
NA,"discussion, wisely pointed out that the",27
NA,"Constitution, under which we work and are",27
NA,"governed, not only affects us as a Common-",27
NA,"wealth Parliament, but has an important",27
NA,bearing on the State Parliaments and Go-,27
NA,vernments. Particularly in the matter of,27
NA,finance the interests of one are irrevocably,27
NA,connected with the interests of the other;,27
NA,"and this, of course, is especially the case",27
NA,during the ten years existence of the opera-,27
NA,tion of the Braddon section. I have viewed,27
NA,the approach of the expiration of the opera-,27
NA,tion of that section with some measure of,27
NA,anxiety. It was clear to my mind that,27
NA,"if we allowed the time to pass without, in",27
NA,"the meantime, arriving at some satisfactory",27
NA,"arrangement, we should find ourselves in",27
NA,absolute possession of an income very much,27
NA,larger than we could at times judiciously,27
NA,"expend, while the States would be placed",27
NA,"in financial difficulties. This being so, I",27
NA,am glad that we have so far arranged mat-,27
NA,ters that an agreement has been come to in,27
NA,conference between representatives of the,27
NA,Commonwealth and the States.,27
NA,not concern me now that under it some of,27
NA,the States will not fare as well as others;,27
NA,it is sufficient to know that their represen-,27
NA,"tatives were able to fall into line, and agree",27
NA,to accept a per capita payment of 25s.,27
NA,Many extraneous matters have been dis-,27
NA,"cussed on the motion before the House, but",27
NA,I do not propose to follow the example of,27
NA,those who introduced them. The honorable,27
NA,member for Batman referred to the imposi-,27
NA,tion of a land tax. I f land taxation is to,27
NA,"be imposed, it should be by the Govern-",27
NA,ments of the States. Only under very ex-,27
NA,traordinary circumstances should the. Com-,27
NA,monwealth impose land taxation. Should,27
NA,the Commonwealth impose a land tax with-,27
NA,out being impelled thereto by pressing ne-,27
NA,"cessity, it would to some extent offend",27
NA,against the Constitution. I refuse to con-,27
NA,sider the agreement as affecting the Tariff.,27
NA,It has been argued that the natural result,27
NA,of a Protective Tariff is to diminish the,27
NA,"returns from Customs, and, undoubtedly, to",27
NA,the extent to which Protective duties' are,27
NA,"effective, they reduce Customs revenue. But",27
NA,the statistics of the world show that many,27
NA,of the most effective Tariffs yield a good,27
NA,"return. Moreover, it has been freely stated",27
NA,"by the Prime Minister that, although we are",27
NA,asked to agree to pay to the States 25s.,27
NA,"per capita, the money must not necessarily",27
NA,be raised by Customs and Excise duties.,27
Mr TUDOR ,Dee s the honorable mem-,27
NA,"ber suggest raising it by direct taxation r""",27
NA,NA,27
NA,"No doubt, when the need arises, the Par-",27
NA,liament of the time will adopt the wisest,27
NA,means_ to meet the occasion. The discus-,27
NA,sions in the Convention make it clear that,27
NA,it was intended that the States should,27
NA,always participate with the Commonwealth,27
NA,in the Customs and Excise revenue.,27
Sir PHILIP FYSH ,Nothin g is more cer-,27
NA,tain.,27
NA,NA,27
NA,breach of faith if the Commonwealth were,27
NA,to refuse to return to the States their fair,27
NA,portion of that-revenue. The Protective,27
NA,policy of Australia is likely to he more,27
NA,stringent in the future than in the past.,27
NA,Honorable members generally are agreed,27
NA,that 25s. per capita is not too large a sum,27
NA,"to return to the States, but it is objected",27
NA,that should the agreement be embodied ip,27
NA,"the Constitution, it will be unalterable. 1",27
NA,do not indorse that view. The electois who-,27
NA,choose the Commonwealth Parliament choose-,27
NA,"also the State Pao-l-iaments, and i f they",27
NA,It does found that more money was going to either,27
NA,the Commonwealth or to the States thart,27
NA,"was needed by one or the other party, thev",27
NA,would insist on a re-division. I t has been-,27
NA,argued that the States will -be against anv,27
NA,amendment of the Constitution with a view-,27
NA,to an alteration of the agreement. But,27
NA,should the Commonwealth find itself in,27
NA,"financial difficulties, and compelled to re-",27
NA,"sort to direct taxation, while the States had",27
NA,"more revenue than they needed, the people",27
NA,would surely insist on an amendment of the,27
NA,Constitution.,27
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , The honorable pied land.,28
NA,member's speech would lead one to regard,28
NA,liim as an anti-Federalist.,28
NA,NA,28
NA,Federalist. The Commonwealth alone can,28
NA,-deal with defence and certain other large,28
NA,"matters; but, while it has great and imtheir",28
NA,"portant functions to discharge, the Governberations",28
NA,ments of the States have also their duties.,28
NA,Australia is too large to be governed wholly,28
NA,from any one centre. Had we had unificamatters,28
NA,tion before the Coolgardie water scheme,28
NA,"was carried out, would it not",28
NA,many years to convince the central Govern-,28
NA,"ment that that scheme was needed, and",28
NA,would have results justifying the expendicaucus?,28
NA,ture ?,28
Mr FOWLER ,W e may judge how long caucus ?,28
NA,it would have taken by the time needed to,28
NA,-obtain a survey of the proposed railway,28
NA,from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta.,28
NA,NA,28
NA,-how long would it take to convince Western',28
NA,Australians or Queenslanders of the justithe,28
NA,fication for expenditure on perhaps necessuch,28
NA,sary irrigation works in Victoria ? Both,28
NA,Commonwealth and the State Governments,28
NA,have work to do in developing the contisiderable,28
NA,"nent, and it is our business to see that",28
NA,revenue is fairly divided between them.,28
NA,"Unquestionably, had this matter been",28
NA,-settled four or five years ago the States,28
NA,-would have received more than they are,28
NA,now likely to receive. New schemes for,28
NA,"-expenditure have been brought forward,",28
NA,"Defence is likely to prove more costly,",28
NA,in various ways we have been made aware,28
NA,of the need for more money for the proper,28
NA,exercise of the functions of the Commonwould,28
NA,"wealth. I t seems to me, however, that",28
NA,return to the States 25s. per capita would,28
NA,-he fair and reasonable. The honorable,28
NA,member for Gippsland said that he would,28
NA,agree to the scheme i f it were to have effect,28
NA,for only a three years' orfiveyears' period.,28
NA,Such an arrangement would not be acceptbeen,28
NA,"able to the States, because it would mean",28
NA,continual financial unrest. The Treasurers,28
NA,of the States would not know how they,28
NA,"would stand at the end of the period,",28
NA,the matter would have to be repeatedly,28
NA,-discussed. I t has been said that the sons,28
NA,"of Victorian, farmers are leaving this State.",28
NA,"Tl is true that some of them, are going",28
NA,"New South Wales, Queensland, and even",28
NA,Western Australia; but I am glad of.that.,28
NA,One of the best things that can happen,28
NA,that Australian-born men should push,28
NA,"into the more remote parts of the continent,",28
NA,and undertake the development of unoccutainty,28
NA,Newcomers will find the,28
NA,"settled parts more congenial, and we may",28
NA,expect immigrants in increasing numbers.,28
NA,consider the proposed agreement accept-,28
NA,able. The members of the Conference are,28
NA,to be commended for having transacted,28
NA,business in private. Had their deli-,28
NA,"been open to the press', an agree-",28
NA,ment might not have been arrived at. I t,28
NA,is often an advantage to be able to discuss,28
NA,"calmly and deliberately, when the",28
NA,eye of the press is not focused on those,28
NA,have taken who are deliberating.,28
NA,NA,28
NA,argument in favour of the Labour party's,28
Mr BATCHELOR ,O r of the Government,28
NA,NA,28
NA,played its cards remarkably well. The,28
NA,caucus method is a good one from the point,28
NA,of view of honorable members opposite.,28
NA,It is essentially a good system to adopt in,28
NA,settlement of big financial questions,28
NA,as these. I f this agreement is em-,28
NA,"the bodied in the Constitution, the problem",28
NA,will of necessity be settled for some con-,28
NA,time. That it will be settled for,28
NA,"the all time, however, I absolutely deny. Lt",28
NA,will be disposed of for a time long enough,28
NA,to enable us to determine more clearly and,28
NA,conclusively what are likely tb be the per-,28
NA,manent requirements of the Commonwealth,28
NA,and State Legislatures. We are certainly,28
NA,wiser to-day than we were ten years ago.,28
NA,and' At the Federal Conventions the foremost,28
NA,thinkers of the time had no data upon,28
NA,which to arrive at a determination as to what,28
NA,be the relative expenditures of the,28
NA,to different Parliaments. But with the know-,28
NA,ledge that has since been gained as the re-,28
NA,sult of our experience during the last ten,28
NA,"years, we are now in a much better posi-",28
NA,tion-to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion.,28
NA,Taking advantage of the data that has thus,28
NA,"obtained, the Commonwealth Govern-",28
NA,"ment, in conjunction with the State Pre-",28
NA,"miers, have determined that a certain pay-",28
NA,ment can be legitimately made to the States,28
NA,and without unduly inconveniencing either,28
NA,"party to the agreement. I f , say, ten years",28
NA,"hence, it is found that the agreement is not",28
NA,"an equitable one', I venture to think that",28
NA,to the people who will to-day consent to its,28
NA,embodiment in the Constitution will just as,28
NA,readily consent to an amendment of the,28
NA,is Constitution to meet the then existing re-,28
NA,out quirements. In the meantime the States,28
NA,will have secured that measure of cer-,28
NA,with respect to their finances which,28
NA,is necessary to enable them to proceed with,29
NA,the various important projects which they,29
NA,"have in view. These considerations, and",29
NA,the fact that I know that the closest at-,29
NA,tention has been given to the. subject by the,29
NA,"Government, induce me to favour the agree-",29
NA,ment. I know that the States are not get-,29
NA,ting all that they wanted. Their repre-,29
NA,sentatives spoke of a per capita payment,29
NA,"of 26s. or 28s. per annum, but they, like",29
NA,"the Commonwealth Government, have had",29
NA,to make concessions. The States have now,29
NA,agreed to accept this per capita payment of,29
NA,"25s. per annum, which is less than.they",29
NA,would have been prepared to accept i f a,29
NA,guarantee of the continuance of the ar-,29
NA,rangement could not have been given.,29
Mr BATCHELOR ,"The y have to accept,",29
NA,"under the Constitution, what this Parlia-",29
NA,ment provides.,29
NA,NA,29
NA,we-should work amicably with the States.,29
Mr BATCHELOR ,"Admittedly , but that",29
NA,is not the question.,29
NA,NA,29
NA,"States in a false position, which might re-",29
NA,sult in their having to impose an amount of,29
NA,direct taxation that would be burdensome to,29
NA,the people. One result of the agreement ar-,29
NA,rived at by the Premiers' Conference was,29
NA,made apparent immediately in Victoria.,29
NA,"Directly the agreement was arrived at, the",29
NA,Victorian State Government faced the,29
NA,"situation, and, wisely or unwisely, pro-",29
NA,posed a land tax.,29
Mr ROBERTS ,Th e State land tax was,29
NA,proposed long before the Conference was,29
NA,held.,29
NA,NA,29
NA,not fixed until after the Conference had,29
NA,taken place. The land tax proposals of,29
NA,the State Government have been framed,29
NA,with due regard to the fact that under,29
NA,this agreement Victoria will receive much,29
NA,less than it has been receiving from the,29
NA,Commonwealth under the Braddon sec-,29
NA,tion. This agreement will relieve the,29
NA,Commonwealth Government of the neces-,29
NA,sity of having to resort to the issue of,29
NA,Treasury bonds as an expedient for meet-,29
NA,ing our immediate difficulties. Surely that,29
NA,is a matter of some importance. The issue,29
NA,"of short-dated bonds is riot wise, but the",29
NA,"Treasurer, in his Budget statement, inti-",29
NA,mated that the Government proposed to,29
NA,resort to that expedient in order to meet,29
NA,temporary difficulties. I f this agreement,29
NA,"be adopted, however, those difficulties will",29
NA,"be removed, since the Commonwealth will",29
NA,be relieved of the obligation to return,29
NA,three-fourths of its Customs and Excise,29
NA,"revenue to the States, and will have more",29
NA,than is necessary to finance the current,29
NA,year. Having regard to the obligations,29
NA,"that are likely to confront us, and to the",29
NA,"revenues we shall possibly receive, it ap-",29
NA,pears to me that i f this agreement be car-,29
NA,"ried -into effect, the Commonwealth will",29
NA,have at its disposal sufficient funds to en-,29
NA,able it to do all that it can legitimately be,29
NA,expected to do out of revenue. I f we at-,29
NA,"tempted, however, to provide out of re-",29
NA,venue for all the great developmental,29
NA,"schemes that we have in view, we should",29
NA,be called upon to impose such heavy taxa-,29
NA,"tion that, instead of Australia holding out",29
NA,attractions to people in other parts of the,29
NA,"world, it would be regarded as a country",29
NA,for people to avoid. That consideration,29
NA,must lead us to the adoption of a rational,29
NA,system of borrowing.,29
Dr WILSON ,I f we construct some of,29
NA,"the proposed transcontinental railways, we",29
NA,shall shortly have to borrow.,29
NA,NA,29
NA,"circumstances all that we have ""to consider",29
NA,is what is a fair division ofthe Customs,29
NA,and Excise revenue between the States and,29
NA,".the Commonwealth, - and I think that, hav-",29
NA,ing regard to the basis of distribution,29
NA,"which has been arrived at, and to the",29
NA,statistical returns which have been laid,29
NA,before us as to the per capita return,29
NA,of Customs and Excise revenue in other,29
NA,"countries, it must be admitted that we are",29
NA,not proposing to return to the States more,29

NA,do.,29

Mr BATCHELOR ,Boothby) [2.15].,29
NA,"-W e occasionally hear complaints, and",29
NA,perhaps sometimes they are made with a,29
NA,"great deal of justice, that honorable mem-",29
NA,bers take no interest in financial debates;,29
NA,but that is certainly not'true of this de-,29
NA,bate. Honorable members are in this in-,29
NA,stance taking a great deal of interest-i n,29
NA,their own speeches at any rate. I,29
NA,admit that I have not heard all the,29
NA,"speeches, but I have been most in-",29
NA,"terested in those I have heard, and",29
NA,regard some of them as very real contri-,29
NA,butions to our information and knowledge,29
NA,upon the various aspects of the financial,29
NA,differences between the Commonwealth,29
NA,and the States. I think it is a pity that,29
NA,"some method could not be"" adopted by",29
NA,which the people of Australia generally,29
NA,might read and examine what is said by,29
NA,both sides on a question of this import-,30
NA,"ance, which will, probably have to be",30
NA,"settled ultimately by the people, and in-",30
NA,evitably by direct reference to them i f this,30
NA,Bill is carried. The necessity for both,30
NA,"sides of every. question being put, so that",30
NA,the people may be in a position to de-,30
NA,"cide, is obvious at any time, but it is ex-",30
NA,tremely difficult to attain that end in this,30
NA,case in the present circumstances of Aus-,30
NA,tralian politics. In this State the Age,30
NA,"puts the views, and reports to some extent",30
NA,"the statements on one side, while the Argus",30
NA,"is reporting on the other side, f n the",30
NA,"other States, all the big daily papers, I",30
NA,"think without exception, are on one side.",30
NA,That is a very great disadvantage from the,30
NA,stand-point of an equitable settlement of,30
NA,the question. When honorable members,30
NA,"talk of the value of a referendum,",30
NA,it is necessary to assume-i f there,30
NA,are any virtues in a general sense of,30
NA,"fairness, and any advantages in a mass",30
NA,decision-tha t a certain amount of accu-,30
NA,rate information will reach the people in,30
NA,order that they may be able to express a,30
NA,"true opinion. When, however, the whole",30
NA,of the information which is placed be-,30
NA,"fore them comes from one side only, then",30
NA,there is a referendum only in name. It is,30
NA,not a referendum to the intelligence of,30
NA,"the people, and the decision obtained will",30
NA,be based on false information or misrepre-,30
NA,sentation supplied from one side only.,30
Mr HARPER ,O r on insufficient infor-,30
NA,mation.,30
Mr BATCHELOR ,O r based on in-,30
NA,"sufficient information, which comes to the",30
NA,"same thing. Of course, one can never",30
NA,hope that full information will be obtained,30
NA,"by the mass of the people generally, but",30
NA,sufficient should be made available to them,30
NA,to enable them to give a vote indicative of,30
NA,"their real interests. I t is a pity, therefore,",30
NA,that we have no means by which we can,30
NA,more widely circulate a debate of this,30
NA,"character, but I suppose it is of no use",30
NA,talking about' that. I am afraid that the,30
NA,day is still far distant when we shall,30
NA,"adopt the sensible plan, which has been",30
NA,suggested by one or two honorable mem-,30
NA,"bers, of having published through all the",30
NA,States a daily Hansard in the same way,30
NA,that the debates of the State Parliament,30
NA,are published each day by the newspapers,30
NA,in South Australia. I only wish that we,30
NA,could adopt a similar method of circulat-,30
NA,ing a report of the debates of this Par-,30
NA,liament throughout the Commonwealth.,30
NA,One thing that I should be glad to feel,30
NA,sure of in discussing this question is,30
NA,whether this Bill is anything more than,30
NA,another feeler on the part of the Govern-,30
NA,ment. The Government have put forward,30
NA,so many financial propositions. For in-,30
NA,"stance., in the Ministerial statement sub-",30
NA,mitted to Parliament in the early days of,30
NA,"this session, the Prime Minister indicated,",30
NA,as the Government's proposal regarding,30
NA,the financial relations of the Common-,30
NA,"wealth and the States, that "" a temporary",30
NA,arrangement for a term of years to replace,30
NA,"the existing distribution "" was being pre-",30
NA,pared. That was the financial basis upon,30
NA,which the present Ministerial fusion was,30
NA,brought about. Whatever may be said,30
NA,about the arrangement now put forward,30
NA,"by the Government, it cannot by anv",30
NA,stretch of the imagination be regarded as,30
NA,"a ""temporary arrangement for a term of",30
NA,"years."" It may be a good or a bad ar-",30
NA,"rangement for the States, but it obviously",30
NA,supersedes the proposal which the same,30
NA,"Goyernment put forward, after taking an",30
NA,adjournment of three weeks to specially,30
NA,consider the financial problem to tide over a,30
NA,period offinancialdifficulty. They have now,30
NA,"dropped that proposition,'and I , therefore,",30
NA,may be pardoned for wondering whether,30
NA,the Prime Minister will stick to the pre-,30
NA,sent arrangement for any length of time.,30
NA,"That ""temporary arrangement for a term",30
NA,"of years "" was only one of many proposals",30
NA,which the Prime Minister has been re-,30
NA,sponsible for submitting. He has been,30
NA,"Prime Minister for a number of years,",30
NA,and a leading member of almost every,30
NA,Goyernment since the beginning of Fede-,30
NA,"ration, and we have had a whole series",30
NA,of financial proposals emanating from the,30
NA,Governments with which he has been con-,30
NA,nected. The Treasurer has also pointed,30
NA,out that he has frequently brought in,30
NA,"Budgets, and he, too, has had a different",30
NA,scheme on each occasion on which he has,30
NA,dealt with this question. We have now,30
NA,"this latest scheme .before us, and ,we are",30
NA,entitled to wonder whether it is of any,30
NA,more use to discuss it than it has been,30
NA,to discuss the other financial proposals,30
NA,which have been put forward and dropped,30
NA,by the Government. All the discussions,30
NA,which took place on the previous proposals,30
NA,upon the assumption that they were the,30
NA,definite and final determination of the .Go-,30
NA,"vernment, were so much waste time. '",30
Mr MCWILLIAMS ,I t is a contract this,30
NA,time.,30
Mr WISE ,Ther e is a political factor,30
NA,behind this!,30
Mr BATCHELOR , I admit the,31
NA,strength of the honorable member's sug-,31
NA,"gestion, but, i f I recollect aright, there",31
NA,vvas a political compact three or four years,31
NA,"ago, and the scheme put forward as the.",31
NA,result of it had to be reconstructed when,31
NA,the compact was broken and new ties were,31
NA,formed. My own view is that the present,31
NA,compact in the very nature of things can-,31
NA,not possibly last. Nothing could testify,31
NA,more strikingly to the fact that it is an,31
NA,"unreal compact, and destined to an early",31
NA,"termination, than the speech which was de-",31
NA,livered by the honorable member for Bat-,31
NA,man this morning in advocacy of a land,31
NA,"tax, to the horror of all those who were",31
NA,sitting immediately around him.,31
Dr WILSON ,D o not sav that.,31
Mr BATCHELOR ,Th e honorable,31
NA,"member himself vvas driven out, and I",31
NA,had to support the maintenance of,31
NA,law and order.. The honorable member,31
NA,for Batman also indicated that he vvas a,31
NA,pronounced unificationist. I notice that he,31
NA,"is now sitting upon this side, where he",31
NA,ought to be always. I admit that he did,31
NA,"not apply the word ""unificationist"" to",31
NA,himself.,31
Mr MAUGER ,H e was perilously near,31
NA,it.,31
Mr BATCHELOR ,Perilousl y neai,31
NA,"i t ! He was right over it, because he",31
NA,favoured the Commonwealth taking over,31
NA,"the railways, education, mines, and lands.",31
NA,"That left the States' with the police, but",31
NA,"as we also have some control over them,",31
NA,and would practically have entire control,31
NA,over them i f all the functions enumerated,31
NA,by the honorable member were taken over,31
NA,"by the Commonwealth, although the States",31
NA,might still have the nomination of the,31
NA,"members of that body, the difference be-",31
NA,tween the honorable member's proposals,31
NA,and unification is so small that it would,31
NA,he rather difficult to measure it.,31
Mr MCDONALD ,I t is only extending,31
NA,the powers of the Commonwealth.,31
Mr BATCHELOR , I should like to,31
NA,tell the honorable member for Batman that,31
NA,although he gains the cheers of the hon-,31
NA,"orable member for Kennedy, he has not",31
NA,the unanimous support of honorable mem-,31
NA,bers upon this side. I certainly do not,31
NA,agree with him. Any one who gives any,31
NA,particular thought to the question must re-,31
NA,cognise that education in particular is one,31
NA,of the last things that should be placed,31
NA,in the hands of a central Government. I,31
NA,quite agree with the honorable member as,31
NA,to the importance of technical and general,31
NA,"education, but it is because I attach such",31
NA,great value to it that I want to,31
NA,see some emulation and rivalry be-,31
NA,tween the States in bringing about,31
NA,the very best method of education.,31
NA,.The methods of education are constantly,31
NA,"being altered and improved; and, in my",31
NA,"opinion,' one huge imiform centralized De-",31
NA,partment for all Australia would be in-,31
NA,tensely conservative and exceedingly un-,31
NA,"wieldy, and, instead of better results,",31
NA,would give much Worse than we have under,31
NA,the administration of the States.,31
Mr MCDONALD ,W e have had the same,31
NA,argument used about every function now,31
NA,exercised by the Federation.,31
Mr BATCHELOR , I may tell the,31
NA,honorable member that at the Brisbane,31
NA,Labour Conference a proposal.for the uni-,31
NA,fication of the railways and education was,31
NA,"rejected, the idea of education as a Federal",31
NA,matter being scouted.,31
Mr MATHEWS , I think it would be,31
NA,easier to unify education than the railways.,31
Mr BATCHELOR ,I t would be one,31
NA,of the easiest things in the world to unify,31
NA,"education, but I should fight to the last",31
NA,"ditch against such a proposal, because I",31
NA,should regard it as extremely prejudicial,31
NA,to the interests of the young people of,31
NA,Australia Honorable members opposite,31
NA,twit us on this side with being unifica-,31
NA,"tionists ; and, in reply, I may point but",31
NA,that there is more dissimilarity in the views,31
NA,of our friends on the Government side on,31
NA,the question of finance and . State Rights,31
NA,generally than is consistent with a party,31
NA,which is said to have a homogeneous,31
NA,"policy, and which expects to endure.",31
NA,"The Prime Minister, in his very ex-",31
NA,"cellent speech, laid much emphasis on",31
NA,"the necessity of treating the States fairly,",31
NA,and of making a proper allotment of the,31
NA,"revenues, urging that, as the States",31
NA,have important and onerous duties to per-,31
NA,"form, they should not be crippled in their",31
NA,finances. All these claims were made very,31
NA,eloquently; and I am sure that we all,31
NA,"admit their truth, though they do not carry",31
NA,us much further in the consideration of the,31
NA,"proposed agreement. We all know that,",31
NA,"under the Constitution, the States have",31
NA,"certain functions, and that it is essential",31
NA,they should not be financially crippled by,31
NA,the Commonwealth j but it is also essen-,31
NA,tial that the Commonwealth should not be,31
NA,crippled. Nobody questions the trite ob-,31
NA,"servations of the Prime Minister, and,",31
NA,"therefore, there is no need for an endless",31
NA,repetition of them. We may assume that,31
NA,every one is anxious that the Public Services,32
NA,"generally, whether Commonwealth or State,",32
NA,should not be hampered by an unfair divi-,32
NA,sion of the revenues. The Braddon,32
NA,"section, after all, was only a temporary",32
NA,"expedient, and is admittedly a clumsy",32
NA,"method of settling the nnancial difficulty,",32
NA,in that it requires the Commonwealth to,32
NA,raise four time its necessary revenue. In,32
NA,"itself, however, the Braddon section is",32
NA,more essentially Federal than the agree-,32
NA,ment we are now considering. I t takes,32
NA,from the Commonwealth only a share of,32
NA,the revenue from a taxing power,32
NA,"which it alone has, and does not",32
NA,permit the States to touch revenues raised,32
NA,in any other form which the Commonwealth,32
NA,may choose to adopt. Seeing that the,32
NA,power to impose Customs duties 'was being,32
NA,"taken away from the States, it was very",32
NA,fairly claimed that the States should have,32
NA,a share of the resultant revenue. And,32
NA,the Braddon section does not im-,32
NA,pose on the Commonwealth any re-,32
NA,striction in regard to the Tariff. We,32
NA,could have a high Protective Tariff with no,32
NA,"revenue, or a Free Trade Tariff equally",32
NA,"with no revenue, or, on the other hand, we",32
NA,could impose a Tariff which would raise,32
NA,"a great deal of money, the only condition",32
NA,being that three-fourths of the revenue must,32
NA,be returned to the States. Awkward as,32
NA,the Braddon section may be from the point,32
NA,"of view of national development, it is not",32
NA,nearly so inconsistent with a national pro-,32
NA,"gressive scheme of finance, as is the ar-",32
NA,rangement now proposed.,32
Sir JOHN FORREST ,"A t any rate, under",32
NA,"the proposed agreement, we shall not have by us.",32
NA,to raise four times the amount we require.,32
Mr BATCHELOR ,-A short time ago,32
NA,the Treasurer was speaking of the virtues,32
NA,"of the Braddon section, of which he was",32
NA,one of the framers. No doubt it was the,32
NA,"best expedient possible at the moment, and,",32
NA,"therefore, we have no right to cast any re-",32
NA,flection on those who gave it birth. Under,32
NA,"all the circumstances, it was not a bad",32
NA,way of meeting an extremely awkward set,32
NA,"of circumstances; and, of course, it has",32
NA,never been claimed that it is anything more,32
NA,than a compromise. The Treasurer must,32
NA,"admit, however, that the Braddon section",32
NA,left fhe Commonwealth more free than,32
NA,does the proposed agreement.,32
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Th e Braddon sec-,32
NA,tion was all right until we wanted to raise,32
NA,more money.,32
Mr BATCHELOR ,An d now I sup-,32
NA,pose it is all wrong whichever way we,32
NA,look at it? The Treasurer has advocated,32
NA,a number of financial schemes.,32
Mr WISE ,An d all totally opposed to,32
NA,the present Government scheme !,32
Mr BATCHELOR ,Quit e so. I t may.,32
NA,be said that I am rather late in the day,32
NA,"in finding virtues in the Braddon section,",32
NA,"but, while agreeing that it is clumsy, I",32
NA,have always held that it possessed the,32
NA,virtue of not imposing on the Common-,32
NA,wealth any obligation as to the form of,32
NA,the Tariff.,32
Mr CHANTER ,Supposin g we decided on,32
NA,"a Tariff such as New South Wales had,",32
NA,where would the revenue come from?,32
Mr BATCHELOR ,Ther e would have,32
NA,been practically no revenue. I do not,32
NA,"often quote my own speeches, but I should",32
NA,like to read the following from some re-,32
NA,marks I made in this House in 1905-,32
NA,It is said that the Braddon section protects,32
NA,"the finances of the States, and, under existing",32
NA,"conditions, it certainly does to some extent.",32
NA,"There appears, however, to be a tendency in",32
NA,"certain quarters to regard it as a fetish, which",32
NA,"must be preserved at all hazards. I , for one,",32
NA,fail to see what special guarantee is afforded,32
NA,through its agency to the States. As a matter,32
NA,"of fact, the guarantee which it offers from the",32
NA,point of view of the States Treasurers is not,32
NA,half as good as that which would follow the,32
NA,adoption of the proposal made by the Trea-,32
NA,surer,32
NA,That is the present Treasurer-,32
NA,that the Constitution should be so amended as,32
NA,to provide that a fixed sum should be neces-,32
NA,"sarily returned, fer cafita, to the States. The",32
NA,Braddon section merely provides that three-,32
NA,fourths of the revenue raised by the Common-,32
NA,wealth shall be returned to the States. I t does,32
NA,not declare what sum shall be annually raised,32
NA,That accords with the view I am to-day,32
NA,"expressing, that the Braddon section is a",32
NA,more Federal arrangement than the,32
NA,proposed agreement. I f we ratify,32
NA,"the agreement, the Commonwealth will",32
NA,be obliged to pay to the States f o r,32
NA,all time a sum much greater than can,32
NA,"bereasonably spared, unless we are to in-",32
NA,crease our revenue by making the Cus-,32
NA,toms taxation of the people heavier. The,32
NA,"Prime Minister told us that, under the-",32
NA,"agreement, the Commonwealth would be",32
NA,free to impose any kind of Tariff. He,32
NA,said-,32
NA,I f our agreement be adopted by this Parlia-,32
NA,"ment, the Commonwealth for the future becomes:",32
NA,free. The ist July next will see the disappear-,32
NA,"ance of S'tate borders, the disappearance of the-",32
NA,"bookkeeping system, and will also find the Com-",32
NA,monwealth relieved of the necessity which has-,32
NA,pressed on us for a number of years of study-,32
NA,ing State Budgets and State circumstances.,32
NA,"As a joke, that is good. As a statement of",33
NA,"fact, coming from such a source, it",33
NA,amounts almost to an insult to the intelli-,33
NA,gence of the community. The Braddon,33
NA,"section empowers the Commonwealth,",33
NA,twelve months hence; to deal with the,33
NA,"finances as it likes. TJnder it, we can raise",33
NA,just as much revenue as we may think,33
NA,"necessary for our purposes, impose such a",33
NA,"Tariff as we may consider best, and pay to",33
NA,the States as much or as little as we feel to,33
NA,be due to them. To compare that position,33
NA,"with our position under the agreement,",33
NA,whereby we shall be compelled to pay to,33
NA,"the States for all time 25s. fer cafita, and",33
NA,to say that the latter is a condition of,33
NA,"freedom, is absurd. Under the agreement",33
NA,we shall have to raise a revenue of at,33
NA,"least 50s. fer cafita, because we shall have",33
NA,"25s. to pay to the States, and will require",33
NA,at least 25s. for our own needs. I shall,33
NA,not consider now what the effect of the,33
NA,present Tariff is likely to be on the revenue,33
NA,"of the future, because we have no data for",33
NA,determining the result .of. its protective,33
NA,duties. When the Treasurer brought down,33
NA,"his Budget papers, I expressed the view",33
NA,that it would be useful to honorable mem-,33
NA,bers to have information regarding the,33
NA,effect of the duties which were imposed for,33
NA,"protective purposes, and the like informa-",33
NA,tion regarding the operation of purely,33
NA,revenue duties. It is important to know,33
NA,the exact effect of-our legislation. At pre-,33
NA,"sent, however, the returns from protective",33
NA,and revenue duties are lumped together,33
NA,"under various heads. For instance, we",33
NA,know what the revenue from the duties on,33
NA,"narcotics and stimulants is, but some of the",33
NA,duties on those articles are highly protec-,33
NA,"tive, while others are merely revenue-pro-",33
NA,"ducing, and we do not know what each set",33
NA,"returns. Similarly, we do not know the",33
NA,effect of the protective duties on agricul-,33
NA,"tural products and groceries, or the return",33
NA,from the revenue-producing duties on those,33
NA,articles. We should be able to compare,33
NA,from year to year the results of both pro-,33
NA,tective and revenue duties. At present we,33
NA,have no d.ita as to the extent to which the,33
NA,Tariff is protective. I therefore ask the,33
NA,Treasurer to consult his officers as to the,33
NA,possibility of some such division of the,33
NA,statistics as I have suggested. The ex-,33
NA,"Minister of Trade and Customs, I under-",33
NA,"stand, directed that something of this kind",33
NA,"should be done, and he informs me that in",33
NA,Mr Knibbs' latest statistics figures are,33
NA,given in regard to nearly one thousand,33
NA,subdivisions.,33
NA,Mr Batchelor.,33
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Th e matter is for,33
NA,the Customs ofncials rather than for the,33
NA,Treasury.,33
Mr BATCHELOR ,Th e preparation,33
NA,"of the Budget is a matter for the Treasury,",33
NA,and surely the Treasurer should know,33
NA,"what the effect of the Tariff is, and what",33
NA,difference alterations of rates are .likely to,33
NA,make. At the present time it is not very,33
NA,profitable to discuss what the future re-,33
NA,venue of Australia will be under the,33
NA,"existing Tariff. We know that, generally",33
NA,"speaking, import duties, Iby encouraging",33
NA,"local industries, cause a diminution of re-",33
NA,"venue. The year before last, our Cus-",33
NA,toms and Excise revenue amounted to about,33
NA,"50s. per head, and, last year, to a little",33
NA,over 48 s.,33
Mr CHANTER ,Las t year there was a,33
NA,"decrease of about £8OQ,OOO.",33
Mr BATCHELOR ,Tha t was in com-,33
NA,parison with the returns of the previous,33
NA,"year, when the clearances in anticipation,",33
NA,"of Tariff changes were abnormal, and the",33
NA,revenue amounted to -£2 ios. per,33
NA,head. So long as the conditions of,33
NA,"commerce are normal, we may expect",33
NA,the revenue from Customs to decline.,33
NA,Hence any scheme based on our ability,33
NA,to pay to the States for all time 25s. per,33
NA,"head per annum, while at the same time",33
NA,having sufficient to meet our own require-,33
NA,"ments, must necessarily fail. The Prime",33
NA,Minister referred to the fact that New,33
NA,Zealand the year before last raised from,33
NA,"Customs and Excise, 70s. per head of her",33
NA,population. Several honorable members,33
NA,"have commented on that statement, but",33
NA,there are one or two aspects of the question,33
NA,to which I should like to draw attention.,33
NA,The honorable gentleman suggested that,33
NA,there was no reason to suppose that Aus-,33
NA,tralia could not raise an equal amount.,33
NA,We should doubtless be able to do so,33
NA,provided that we adopted the New Zea-,33
NA,"land Tariff. That, however, would mean",33
NA,the sacrifice of a good deal of our Pro-,33
NA,"tection. I find, for instance, that in 1906",33
NA,New Zealand's fer cafitareturn from,33
NA,"Customs and Excise duties on sugar, to-",33
NA,"bacco and cigars, spirits and wine, was 27s.,",33
NA,and that in 1907 it amounted to 28s. gd.,33
NA,I have not included in the list all nar-,33
NA,"cotics and stimulants, because the duties",33
NA,in respect to some of them both under the,33
NA,Commonwealth and New Zealand Tariffs,33
NA,are purely revenue producing. Last year,33
NA,the revenue from these four items in New,33
NA,Zealand dropped because sugar was made,33
NA,"free, and the Tariff was altered in some",33
NA,other direction. Instead of being £ 3 ios.,34
NA,"per head of the population, it dropped last",34
NA,year to £ 3 4s. per head. Thefiguresfor,34
NA,last year will not be found in the bound,34
NA,"volume of the New Zealand Year-Book,",34
NA,but I have obtained them from some ad-,34
NA,vance unbound copies that have reached,34
NA,the Library. The Customs and Excise col-,34
NA,"lected on spirits, tobacco and cigars, and",34
NA,sugar in Australia in 1906 amounted to,34
NA,"only 18s. i d . per head of the population,",34
NA,as against 27s. per head collected in New,34
NA,"Zealand, and in 1907 to 18s. n d . as",34
NA,against 28s. 9d. per head collected in the,34
NA,Dominion. That difference is entirely due,34
NA,to the fact that we produce the commodi-,34
NA,ties in question to a much larger extent,34
NA,than New Zealand does. New Zealand,34
NA,has dropped the Excise duty and has,34
NA,abandoned the idea of producing narcotics,34
NA,and stimulants from which she is anxious,34
NA,to obtain as much revenue as possible.,34
Mr TUDOR ,Th e New Zealand Goform,34
NA,vernment with that object in view bought,34
NA,out the local distilleries.,34
Mr BATCHELOR,I n order that it items.,34
NA,might increase its revenue from spirits New,34
NA,Zealand bought out the local distilleries;,34
NA,and the distillation of spirits is no longer,34
NA,carried on there. We have also to rememand,34
NA,ber that New Zealand is not a wine proit is fo-day.,34
NA,ducing country. We could not hope to,34
NA,raise as much revenue as New Zealand,34
NA,does since Australia with a climate ranging,34
NA,from the heat of the tropics to the extreme raising now.,34
NA,cold of the south offers a wider field for,34
NA,production. In these circumstances,34
NA,cisely similar Tariff would give a larger,34
NA,fer cafita return in New Zealand than,34
NA,the Commonwealth. New Zealand derives,34
NA,a large proportion of her revenue from,34
NA,"wine, but in Australia we have no Excise",34
NA,"duty upon it, and could obtain a revenue",34
NA,"-excepting , of course, sparkling wines",34
NA,which are imported to some extent-onl,34
NA,by the imposition of such a duty.,34
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Doe s the honorable,34
NA,member advocate an Excise duty?,34
Mr BATCHELOR ,Th e right honorTerritory,34
NA,able member is really advocating,34
NA,position by urging the adoption of this scale that the majority,34
NA,agreement. I f it is to be carried,34
NA,shall have to give up the production of the,34
NA,commodities to which I have referred.,34
NA,The agreement will land the Commonber,34
NA,wealth in such difficulties that it will have,34
NA,to raise more revenue in order to give effect,34
NA,to it. Naturally in such circumstances the,34
NA,"first step taken with a view to ""securing way ?",34
NA,more revenue would be to impose an Excise,34
NA,duty on wine.,34
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Whe n shall we be,34
NA,in the difficulties to which the honorable,34
NA,member refers?,34
Mr BATCHELOR , I do not think,34
NA,that it will be very long.,34
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Ha s the honorable,34
NA,member made any calculation as to the re-,34
NA,venue we shall be receiving in 1920? We,34
NA,shall have more.,34
Mr BATCHELOR ,Th e tright hon-,34
NA,orable 'member after all is indulging in,34
NA,mere guess work. He admits that he has,34
NA,not in his Department statistics to guide,34
NA,him as to what will be the future,34
NA,operationof the Tariff. I have not calcu-,34
NA,"lated what the revenue will be in 1920, and",34
NA,no one can say what it will be. We may,34
NA,"use the data at our disposal, but after all",34
NA,we can arrive only at an approximation of,34
NA,what the returns will be. To enable us to,34
NA,a more definite conclusion on the sub-,34
NA,"ject, the right honorable member, in his",34
NA,"Budget Papers, should distinguish between",34
NA,purely revenue-producing and protective,34
Mr BAMFORD ,Th e probabilities are,34
NA,that the fer cafita return from Customs,34
NA,Excise in 1920 will not be more than,34
Mr BATCHELOR ,I t is not reason-,34
NA,able to suppose that we shall be able to,34
NA,raise more fer cafita in 1920 than we are,34
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Bu t i f we do we,34
NA,a preshall be all right.,34
Mr BATCHELOR ,Surel y the right,34
NA,in honorable member does not think that we,34
NA,have reached the limit of our expenditure?,34
NA,I f we make this return to the States for,34
NA,"all time, it will be impossible for us to",34
NA,carry out the undertakings to which the,34
NA,Commonwealth is pledged. Assuming that,34
NA,"y we make this payment, and that our Cus-",34
NA,toms and Excise return fer cafita is main-,34
NA,tained at 50s -whic h is very unlikely-w e,34
NA,shall not be able to take over the Northern,34
NA,and to develop it by constructing,34
NA,its imwe be able to pay railway.,34
NA,a transcontinental Neither shall',34
NA,old-age pensions on the,34
NA,of honorable mem-,34
NA,out we bers desire to see adopted.,34
Mr KELLY ,Does - the -honorable mem-,34
NA,think that the Treasurer would sup-,34
NA,port this agreement i f he thought it would,34
NA,interfere with' the construction of the,34
NA,Western Australian transcontinental rail-,34
Mr BATCHELOR , I have known the,35
NA,right honorable member to be guilty of,35
NA,many inconsistencies; and perhaps' the sug-,35
NA,gestion just made by the honorable member,35
NA,for Wentworth may cause him even now to,35
NA,hesitate to urge the Parliament to adopt,35
NA,this agreement.,35
Sir JOHN FORREST , I am not,35
NA,frightened.,35
Mr BATCHELOR ,I f the honorable,35
NA,"member were, I think that he would be slow",35
NA,to ask the people of Australia to support,35
NA,"this proposal. I do not desire, however, to",35
NA,"labour this point. Every one knows, no",35
NA,matter what statements may be made for,35
NA,"party purposes, that it is exceedingly un-",35
NA,likely that the people would submit to the,35
NA,imposition of a Tariff that would pro-,35
NA,duce from Customs and Excise more,35
NA,than 50s. per head of the population.,35
NA,The tendency is certain to be in the,35
NA,direction of a decrease per head.,35
NA,those circumstances we cannot hope in the,35
NA,future to be able to pay 25s. per head to,35
NA,"the States, and still hare enough to meet",35
NA,our own commitments. What would have,35
NA,been very much better was some modifica-,35
NA,tion of the proposals of the honorable,35
NA,member for Mernda. I have always looked,35
NA,to the taking over of the State debts by,35
NA,the Commonwealth to wipe out all these,35
NA,financial difficulties.,35
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Tha t is,35
NA,"Constitution, any way.",35
Mr BATCHELOR ,I t is the Consti-,35
NA,tution. The Constitution lays it down dis-,35
NA,tinctly that the Commonwealth may take,35
NA,"over the State debts, and one of the great",35
NA,reasons urged upon the people for accept-,35
NA,ing the Constitution was the hope that,35
NA,great savings would result through the,35
NA,Commonwealth taking the debts over.,35
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Tha t is right; but,35
NA,the States had to indemnify the Common-,35
NA,wealth'.,35
Mr BATCHELOR ,O f course; but,35
NA,that is not the point. The whole point,35
NA,I wish to make is that it would get over,35
NA,the difficulty as between the States and the,35
NA,Commonwealth. The right honorable mem-,35
NA,ber interjects that it was not contemplated,35
NA,"in the Constitution, but it certainly was.",35
NA,I f there was one thing more than another,35
NA,contemplated in the Constitution it was,35
NA,"that the State debts should be taken over,",35
NA,and it was laid down expressly that the,35
NA,States were to indemnify the Common-,35
NA,wealth for 'any costto which it might be,35
NA,put. That part of the problem has now been,35
NA,dropped. I admit that I cannot attach any,35
NA,"great importance to the State Debts Bill,",35
NA,"which is also to be brought forward, be-",35
NA,cause all that it proposes to do is to ex-,35
NA,tend the Constitution so that the whole,35
NA,"of the State debts, and not only a part of",35
NA,"them, may be taken over. That does not",35
NA,"easily get us any "" forrarder."" For ten years",35
NA,we have had the right to take over the,35
NA,debts incurred by the States up to the time,35
NA,"of Federation, but we have done nothing",35
NA,in the matter. We could have wiped out,35
NA,"the Braddon blot, and saved all the trouble",35
NA,if we had taken over the debts in the last,35
NA,ten years.,35
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Wipe d out the,35
NA,Braddon blot?,35
Mr BATCHELOR ,Th e Constitution,35
NA,provided that the Braddon section should,35
NA,apply until the Commonwealth took the,35
NA,"In debts over, and not after.",35
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Th e Braddon sec-,35
NA,tion applied for ten years. It had nothing,35
NA,to do with the taking over of the debts.,35
Mr BATCHELOR ,Th e taking over,35
NA,of the debts would have superseded the,35
NA,Braddon section,35
Mr GROOM ,Th e honorable member,35
NA,"means "" in effect.""",35
Mr BATCHELOR ,O f course I ' mean,35
NA,in effect. I did not mean to say in so,35
NA,not the many words that it would do so.,35
Mr SPEAKER ,Order . I would point,35
NA,out to honorable members that this is vir-,35
NA,"tually ,a second-reading debate, and not a",35
NA,"dialogue, and that honorable members are",35
NA,not entitled to take up the time occupied,35
NA,by others in making their speeches.,35
Mr BATCHELOR ,I f three-fourths,35
NA,of the Commonwealth revenue had ibeen ab-,35
NA,"sorbed in paying interest on the State debts,",35
NA,"that would have absolutely wiped out, in",35
NA,"effect, the Braddon section.",35
Mr GROOM ,Bu t it would have left,35
NA,the Commonwealth with only one-fourth.,35
Mr BATCHELOR ,"O f course, it",35
NA,would not have affected the revenue of the,35
NA,"Commonwealth, but it would have wiped",35
NA,out the difficulties that existed at the time,35
NA,between the Commonwealth and the States.,35
NA,One of the reasons why I greatly object to,35
NA,"this agreement is that, instead of being",35
NA,likely to hasten the taking over of the,35
NA,"State debts, it will delay it, and I think",35
NA,that any one who looks at the question can,35
NA,hardly avoid arriving at the same conclu-,35
NA,"sion. Under the Constitution as it stands,",35
NA,if the Commonwealth were to take over the,36
NA,State debts at the present time it would be,36
NA,to the interest of the Commonwealth to,36
NA,"make every saving possible, because it",36
NA,would receive a larger revenue in conse-,36
NA,quence. There would be every incentive to,36
NA,the Commonwealth to insure the most care-,36
NA,"ful management, and to save to the people",36
NA,"as much as possible, because every penny",36
NA,that could be saved would increase the,36
NA,Commonwealth revenue.,36
Sir JOHN FORREST ,How ?,36
Mr BATCHELOR ,Whe n we take,36
NA,"over the debts, the interest on them be-",36
NA,comes a charge on the Commonwealth re-,36
NA,"venue, and the more savings we make in",36
NA,"conversion, the more economical the man-",36
NA,"agement of the debts, the more revenue",36
NA,will be left to the Commonwealth.,36
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Woul d not,36
NA,States get the saving?,36
Mr BATCHELOR ,Certainl y not.,36
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Tha t is a,36
NA,idea!,36
Mr BATCHELOR ,Doe s the right,36
NA,honorable member mean to say that if the,36
NA,"Commonwealth took over the State debts,",36
NA,and gradually wiped out the whole of,36
NA,"them, it would still have to pay to the",36
NA,States the amount which it had wiped out,36
NA,by the saving that it made?,36
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Certainly ;,36
NA,savings would go to the States.,36
Mr BATCHELOR ,Tha t is a most,36
NA,extraordinary proposition !,36
Sir JOHN FORREST ,I t was part of my,36
NA,proposal.,36
Mr BATCHELOR , I have never,36
NA,"heard it before, and i f the right honorable",36
NA,"member considers it, I am sure he will",36
NA,recognise that it is an unthinkable proposi-,36
NA,tion. I admit that that would be the re-,36
NA,sult i f the agreement now before us were,36
NA,"carried, and the Constitution were amended",36
NA,in such a way that we had to pay the,36
NA,States 25s. per head for all time.' In that,36
NA,"case, no matter how many savings the",36
NA,"Commonwealth made, it would be no better",36
NA,off. The Commonwealth might wipe out,36
NA,that proportion of the debts which is re-,36
NA,presented by 25s. per head-abou t,36
NA,"£160,000,000-i n a period of years, by",36
NA,means of savings in conversion and careful,36
NA,"management, but it would ibe no better off",36
NA,as the States would still receive from it,36
NA,25s. per head. We should then have taken,36
NA,"over the debts from the States, handed over",36
NA,"to them their reproductive works, and left",36
NA,them with all their assets and undertak-,36
NA,ings,36
Sir JOHN FORREST ,"O f course, the",36
NA,honorable member regards the States as a,36
NA,lot of aliens !,36
Mr BATCHELOR ,Th e right honor-,36
NA,able member need not be silly. According,36
NA,"to the present proposal of the Government,",36
NA,if we wipe out the State debts in twenty or,36
NA,"thirty years, and leave the States with their",36
NA,"assets free, and in full enjoyment of all",36
NA,"the revenues derivable from those assets, it",36
NA,will make no difference to the Common-,36
NA,"wealth, which will have to go on paying",36
NA,the States 25s. per head.,36
Mr HEDGES ,W e should wipe the,36
NA,"debts out with the States' money, which the",36
NA,States allow us to collect.,36
Mr BATCHELOR ,Tha t is a curious,36
NA,the sort of argument.,36
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Her e are my pro-,36
NA,posals as reported in Hansard. Will the,36
NA,new honorable member look at No. 8 of them?,36
Mr BATCHELOR ,Th e right honor-,36
NA,able member has handed me a report of,36
NA,"the Budget speech for 1906, in which he",36
NA,lays it down that-,36
NA,A l l net profits arising from any conversion,36
NA,or redemption of existing loans should be,36
NA,credited by the Commonwealth to the State con-,36
NA,"cerned, and the annual payment by that State",36
NA,reduced accordingly from time to time.,36
NA,"all the Of course, I agree with that, but that is",36
NA,not the point which I was making. I t,36
NA,simply means that any saving made would,36
NA,go to reduce the amounts which the States',36
NA,had to make up to the Commonwealth dur-,36
NA,.ing the time that the Braddon section con-,36
NA,tinued to operate. I was dealing with the,36
NA,"period when we had got beyond that stage,",36
NA,and when the savings became much more,36
NA,than the amounts by which the States had,36
NA,to indemnify the Commonwealth. Even,36
NA,the Treasurer has never yet suggested that,36
NA,we should then go on paying all the profits,36
NA,to the States.,36
Sir JOHN FORREST , I do.,36
Mr BATCHELOR ,Th e words-,36
NA,The annual payment by that State reduced,36
NA,"accordingly from time, to time,",36
NA,refer only to payments by the States to the,36
NA,Commonwealth. They cannot refer to a,36
NA,time when the payments by the States to,36
NA,the Commonwealth will have ceased - As I,36
NA,"should like to clear up this point, which is",36
NA,"of some importance, I should be glad to",36
NA,obtain leave to continue my remarks on a,36

Dr MALONEY ,Melbourne) [3.30] -,37
NA,I am sorry to have again to bring the ad-,37
NA,ministration of the Old-age Pensions Act,37
NA,under the notice of the House. I have,37
NA,NA,37
NA,the representative of North Melbourne in,37
NA,"the State Parliament, and forwarded by",37
NA,"that gentleman to me, and I have also had",37
NA,brought under my notice by Sir Alexander,37
NA,"Peacock, M.L.A., the great difficulty that",37
NA,is caused by the number of questions that,37
NA,are put to applicants. I should have,37
NA,"thought that, seeing the Postmaster-Gene-",37
NA,ral and the honorable member for Batman,37
NA,"are opposed to the present system, that",37
NA,some remedy would have been applied;,37
NA,but it would appear that all questions,37
NA,asked or communications sent are evaded or,37
NA,"put on one side. The Treasurer, whose",37
NA,"stomach is never empty, tells us that cases",37
NA,brought under his notice have been sent,37
NA,"011 to the registrars, and that in a few",37
NA,weeks replies may be expected. Such a,37
NA,state of things is really absurd; and I be-,37
NA,lieve that the unnecessary delay is resented,37
NA,by nine out of ten of the taxpayers.,37
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Th e consideration,37
NA,of the Victorian applications is nearly,37
NA,finished.,37
Dr MALONEY ,I f the Treasurer says,37
NA,"that, let me tell him that he does not know",37
NA,what he is talking about; and i f the mat-,37
NA,"ter were debated in a meeting, say, at the",37
NA,"Melbourne Town Hall, the pity and con-",37
NA,tempt of the people would be his. The,37
NA,NA,37
NA,is as follows:-,37
NA,"In regard to your memo, re Mrs Fahey, ""a",37
NA,pension of ios. per week was recommended in,37
NA,"her case on the ist instant, and the papers",37
NA,were sent on the same day to the Old-age Pen-,37
NA,"sion Office. I have written in re the matter,",37
NA,which will perhaps liven them up. JFhe above,37
NA,remarks apply to Mr Tucker's case. There,37
NA,seems to be an extraordinary amount of delay,37
NA,in dealing with the claims at the Old-age Pen-,37
NA,sion office. I shall always be glad to do any-,37
NA,thing for you in this matter.,37
NA,On that letter is the following note by Mr.,37
NA,Prendergast:-,37
NA,Please note the length of time the pension,37
NA,papers remain undealt with in the Common-,37
NA,wealth offices.,37
NA,I have another letter here which was,37
NA,handed to me -by the honorable member for,37
NA,"Maribyrnong, in whose district the case is,",37
NA,and it is as follows:-,37
NA,"I wrote you, and gave you f u l l particulars",37
NA,"about my husband,- F. W. Ellsworth, applying",37
NA,"for a pension, the ist of July. You were kind",37
NA,"enough to answer that letter, and thanks very",37
NA,much for your kind sympathy. I thought I,37
NA,would let you know how he got on. The first,37
NA,"lime he went before the Court, he was recom-",37
NA,mended for ios. .a week. Another month passed;,37
NA,then he was told to apply again at Court. He,37
NA,"did so, and the gentleman said, "" The papers",37
NA,"are returned,"" and said, "" They will not grant",37
NA,"you ios. a week."" Everything had to be gone",37
NA,"over again, then he was recommended for 7s.",37
NA,6d. a week. Another month passed. This,37
NA,"week he got word his pension was granted, and",37
NA,"when he went, all they had granted him is",37
NA,"5s. a week. Now, sir, is that all respectable",37
NA,old people can get at the age of 71 years? He,37
NA,"has not been able to work for some years, and",37
NA,I have had a hard struggle to make ends meet.,37
NA,"My age is 64, and for many years I have had",37
NA,"very bad health, suffering from gall stones.",37
NA,"We possess nothing, but i f we live for another",37
NA,"five years, and can keep the payment up of the",37
NA,"house we are buying, we should have a roof",37
NA,over our heads.,37
NA,It seems to me that the Department does,37
NA,not make any allowance for a house that,37
NA,has been bought on the instalment plan.,37
NA,"I f the amount paid up were considered, it",37
NA,would be a fair thing; but it is decidedly,37
NA,not right to take into account a house which,37
NA,will not be paid for until five years have,37
NA,elapsed. This man is suffering from,37
NA,diabetes.,37
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Wh y do you not,37
NA,send on these cases to the Department?,37
Dr MALONEY , I am sick and tired,37
NA,of sending cases on.,37
Sir JOHN FORREST , I am sure the hon-,37
NA,orable gentleman always gets civility and,37
NA,attention.,37
Dr MALONEY , I get civility from,37
NA,those who do not know what these delays,37
NA,mean to the poor people-fro m an officer,37
NA,"who draws £ 2 0 a week, and has as much",37
NA,"sympathy with the cases as, perhaps, the",37
NA,Treasurer has.,37
Mr CROUCH , I have written several,38
NA,"letters to the Treasurer, and have not re-",38
NA,ceived answers.,38
Dr MALONEY ,"What , then, becomes",38
NA,of the alleged civilitv and readiness to re-,38
NA,ply?,38
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Th e honorable,38
NA,member only desires to find fault and ad-,38
NA,vertise himself.,38
Dr MALONEY ,I f I advertised my-,38
NA,"self as the honorable member does, I",38
NA,should be a Guy Fawkes.,38
Mr SPEAKER , 1 have-already called,38
NA,"honorable members to order several times,",38
NA,and I ask them not to break the Standing,38
NA,Orders by interrupting the honorable mem-,38
NA,ber addressing the House.,38
Dr MALONEY ,Her e is another case,38
NA,in the constituency of the honorable mem-,38
NA,"ber for Gippsland, to whom I shall hand",38
NA,on the letter-,38
NA,"A short time ago, I wrote, to you calling your",38
NA,attention to how I had been treated in reference,38
NA,"to my old-age pension, but, since then, I have",38
NA,come acquainted with the new feature in refer-,38
NA,ence to the administration of pensions. My,38
NA,"wife, not being satisfied as to the amount that",38
NA,"she was receiving, wrote to the police magis-",38
NA,"trate that inquired into her case, at the Moe",38
NA,"Court-house, on 26th July last, explaining some",38
NA,mistakes she had made in answering some of,38
NA,the questions that the police magistrate asked,38
NA,"her with a view of getting things reviewed, and",38
NA,"informing him of the amount she was receiving,",38
NA,"viz., 4s. 6d. per week. She got an answer to",38
NA,"her letter, a copy of which I herein enclose,",38
NA,"informing her that the amount that he, the police",38
NA,"magistrate, had recommended to the Commis-",38
NA,"sioner, that she should have was £14 a year for",38
NA,"herself, and also, her husband. Now, I con-",38
NA,sider the difference between £14 that the police,38
NA,"magistrate recommended, and the 4s. 6d. a week",38
NA,"which we are paid, amounts to £11 14s., mak-",38
NA,ing a difference of £ 2 6s. a year for each of,38
NA,us. The question I should like to have answered,38
NA,"is, what is the use of appointing a police magis-",38
NA,trate to inquire into the old-age pension ap-,38
NA,"plications, i f their decisions and recommenda-",38
NA,"tions are not to be followed out, and by whose",38
NA,"authority this kind of thing can be carried out,",38
NA,whether it is by the instruction of the Trea-,38
NA,"surer to the Chief Commissioner, or the Com-",38
NA,"missioner to his deputy, to carry on these cheese-",38
NA,"paring tactics? I t would be interesting to know,",38
NA,so that the blame might rest on the right,38
NA,shoulders. I t might not seem much to the,38
NA,officer who has the administration of the pen-,38
NA,"sions, that the difference of £14 and £11 14s. is",38
NA,"only £ 6s. a year, is very much to make",38
NA,2,38
NA,"a complaint about, but i f those officers had to",38
NA,"change places with us, they would find that that",38
NA,would make a material difference.,38
NA,"In reference to this case, the following",38
NA,memorandum was sent by the Clerk of,38
NA,Courts at Traralgon : -,38
NA,I am directed by the police magistrate to in-,38
NA,form you that he recommended £14 per annum,38
NA,"in each case, yours and that of your husband.",38
NA,Any further communication in the matter should,38
NA,be to the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions for,38
NA,"Victoria at Melbourne, who may remit the cases",38
NA,to the police magistrate for rehearing i f he,38
NA,"thinks fit, on the materials that are on the fresh",38
NA,matter you may place before him.,38
NA,There are about 180 questions to be,38
NA,answered by the applicants and their,38
NA,"friends j and, in addition, the police magis-",38
NA,trate has power to ask any question he,38
NA,"likes, and the latter, unlike the officers of",38
NA,"the Department, has before him the appli-",38
NA,cants. I should like to know why it is that,38
NA,the Department so frequently alters the,38
NA,"decisions of the magistrates, and why such",38
NA,an unreasonable length of time is occupied,38
NA,in the remission of the cases. It is not,38
NA,pleasant to me to have to continually bring,38
NA,such cases before the House; but if honor-,38
NA,able members could see the worry caused,38
NA,"by the unnecessary and infamous questions,",38
NA,"I feel certain that, on a vote in the House,",38
NA,"95 per cent, of them would be wiped out.",38
Mr CROUCH ,Corio) [3.43] - I do not,38
NA,be- think it is a good practice to bring indivi-,38
NA,"dual cases before the House, but i f the",38
NA,"honorable member for Melbourne, who ap-",38
NA,pears to have an unusually large number,38
NA,"of them on his hands, has had the same",38
NA,"experience as myself, he is justified in his",38
NA,action. ' Personally I have had only five-,38
NA,"cases of the kind sent to me, and I wrote",38
NA,in reference to them to the Department.,38
NA,Three of the communications' I forwarded,38
NA,"to the Treasurer, and not one of them has",38
NA,"been replied to, even in acknowledgment",38
NA,"of their receipt. One of these cases, how-",38
NA,"ever, I know has been attended to; but, in",38
NA,"reference to the other two, I addressed",38
NA,"myself to individual officers, and then they",38
NA,were looked after. I f letters are addressed,38
NA,"to the Treasurer, it should be somebody's",38
NA,"duty to, at any rate, acknowledge their re-",38
NA,ceipt. No matter what time may be occu-,38
NA,"pied, the honorable member for Melbourne,",38
NA,"if his treatment has been similar, should",38
NA,"see that the facts are laid before the House,",38
NA,"or, otherwise, his constituents may think that",38
NA,he is neglecting his duty. There is a mat-,38
NA,ter in connexion with the Defence Depart-,38
NA,ment to which I desire to direct attention.,38
NA,For the last seventeen months the infantry,38
NA,militia of Victoria has been without,38
NA,bayonets. New rifles were issued in,38
NA,"March, 1908, to the force at Bendigo,",38
NA,"Ballarat, and in the metropolis, and to a",38
NA,number of the men of the volunteer in-,38
NA,"fantry, but they were not accompanied with",38
NA,bayonets. The average service of a,38
NA,"militiaman is about eighteen months, so",38
NA,that between one-half and two-thirds of,38
NA,the present militia forces of Victoria are,38
NA,without training in the use of the bayonet.,39
NA,We know how important a part the bayonet,39
NA,"played in the Russo-Japanese wai, not-",39
NA,withstanding the long range of the modern,39
NA,"rifle, and the usefulness of and need for",39
NA,training in bayonet work is obvious. 1,39
NA,have been told that representations have,39
NA,been made to the District Commandant by,39
NA,"the regimental commanders, but that, as",39
NA,"an artilleryman, he knows little about infan-",39
NA,try requirements and does not see the im-,39
NA,"portance of issuing bayonets, and has",39
NA,pooh-poohed the proposals submitted to,39
NA,"him. About 50,000 bayonets are at some",39
NA,future time to be altered to fit the short,39
NA,rifle. It must be remembered that what-,39
NA,ever defence scheme may be adopted will,39
NA,not be perfected for seven years.,39
NA,proposed by the Government is not to be,39
NA,"initiated until ist July, 1911. I f , until",39
NA,"then, the Victorian District Commandant",39
NA,has decreed that the militiamen are to be,39
NA,without training in the use of the bayonet,39
NA,-i t is only in Victoria that this state of,39
NA,affairs obtains-i t will be a very unfor-,39
NA,tunate thing for the country.,39
NA,NA,39
NA,have received numerous complaints regard-,39
NA,ing the administration of the Old-age Pen-,39
NA,"sions Act, one of the most serious reaching",39
NA,me within the last two days. A magis-,39
NA,trate in the northern part of the State which,39
NA,"I represent is alleged to have said, when",39
NA,inquiry was made as to the cause of delay,39
NA,"in dealing with pension applicants, that he",39
NA,had no time for Commonwealth work while,39
NA,"there was State, work to be done.",39
NA,informed that he is not paid for Common-,39
NA,wealth work.,39
Mr TUDOR ,Surel v that is incorrect.,39
NA,NA,39
NA,"mation which I have received, and I sug-",39
NA,gest that inquiry should be made to ascer-,39
NA,tain whether it is correct. It is very hard,39
NA,"that the old persons of South Australia,",39
NA,where pensions have been promised since,39
NA,"the nineties, should be prevented from tak-",39
NA,ing advantage of our humane legislation.,39
NA,It will be a crying shame if this great Act,39
NA,loses its effect by reason of the inaction,39
NA,of stipendiary magistrates or others. There,39
NA,has been published in Adelaide a list o'f,39
NA,the applications dealt with and finally,39
NA,"settled, but it contains only an infinitesimal",39
NA,part of the whole number of applicants.,39
NA,I cannot understand why so much time,39
NA,is taken in dealing with applications. One,39
NA,complaint I make is that everything is done,39
NA,to prevent old persons from getting pen-,39
NA,"sions. Applicants living in miserable,",39
NA,"ramshackle structures, only suitable for",39
NA,"wood houses, have had large sums deducted",39
NA,from their pensions. The other day I,39
NA,heard of such a deduction in connexion with,39
NA,an applicant living in a three-roomed,39
NA,"wooden house in Port Augusta, valued by",39
NA,the council at £160. A few years ago I,39
NA,sold a five-roomed wooden house in that,39
NA,"town for JQT.0, and am certain that no-",39
NA,three-roomed wooden affair would realize-,39
NA,in the market-whic h is a true test of,39
NA,value-one-thir d of £160. Those ad-,39
NA,ministering the Invalid and Old-age Pen-,39
NA,sions Act accept every inflated valuation,39
NA,"made by a municipality, to the detriment of",39
NA,the unfortunate applicants for pensions. I,39
NA,trust that the Minister will have inquiries,39
NA,made from the Deputy Commissioner in,39
NA,That Adelaide as to the cause of the delays,39
NA,"which have occurred in South Australia,",39
NA,and as to the reported utterances of the,39
NA,magistrate to whom I have referred.,39
Dr LIDDELL ,Hunter) [3.53] - I de-,39
NA,sire to put myself right about a matter as,39
NA,to which I have been misunderstood. On,39
NA,Wednesday last I drew attention to the,39
NA,fact that it was the declared policy of the,39
NA,Postmaster-General's Department 'not to,39
NA,put public telephones into hotels. Since,39
NA,"then, persons have spoken to me on the",39
NA,subject in a manner which makes me think,39
NA,that there are some who regard me as an,39
NA,advocate for the placing of telephone .,39
NA,bureaux in public-houses or other buildings,39
NA,where drink is sold. That is not my,39
NA,desire. What I wished to point out was,39
NA,that the Department is depriving the travel-,39
NA,"I am ling public of a necessary .convenience, and",39
NA,"is losing revenue, by refusing to place",39
NA,penny-in-the-slot telephones in hotels. I,39
NA,am acquainted with a hotel in Melbourne,39
NA,where there are three telephones-on e in,39
NA,"the manager's office, another under the",39
NA,"care of the housekeeper, and a third for the",39
NA,use of the guests. As persons staying in,39
NA,"the hotel may not use the manager's, or",39
NA,"the housekeeper's, telephone, it is very",39
NA,difficult for them to despatch messages.,39
NA,Were the Department managed on commer-,39
NA,"cial principles, it would seize an oppor-",39
NA,tunity like this to install a slot instrument.,39
NA,Some time ago I brought the matter under,39
NA,the notice ot the honorable member for,39
NA,"Eden-Monaro, when he was Postmaster-",39
NA,"General, and being a man of liberal ideas",39
NA,"and considerable business experience, he",39
NA,"was inclined to adopt my view that, where",39
NA,telephones are needed in large residential,39
NA,"hotels, the Department should supply them.",39
NA,"I do not blame the Postmaster-General, be-",39
NA,cause I think that these matters are con-,39
NA,"trolled by his officers. They, however,",39
NA,have been trained from their earliest years,40
NA,"in the rules of the Department, and have",40
NA,had to look at the world through their,40
NA,"pigeon-holes. Nor travelling much, they",40
NA,know of little beyond what happens in the,40
NA,Department.,40
Sir JOHN QUICK ,Thi s is a matter' for,40
NA,which the Minister is responsible.,40
Dr LIDDELL , The Department,40
NA,Should conduct its business on commercial,40
NA,"lines, and give the public the facilities to",40
NA,which it is entitled. At the present time,40
NA,the Departmental practice is inconsistent.,40
NA,I t is stated in the Telephone Directory that,40
NA,public telephones will not be allowed in,40
NA,public-houses. A hotelkeeper may hire a,40
NA,telephone from the Department at the rate,40
NA,"of two calls a penny, and charge his",40
NA,lodgers one call a penny. But this ar-,40
NA,rangement necessitates the continuous em-,40
NA,ployment of an attendant. I t has been,40
NA,suggested that a box might be provided,40
NA,into which users of telephones might drop,40
NA,their coins. But the public will not pay,40
NA,when it can get a service without paying.,40
NA,Notwithstanding the rule that public tele-,40
NA,"phones are not to be placed in hotels, I",40
NA,"find that there is one at the Palace Hotel,",40
NA,"Bourke-street, another at the Anglers'",40
NA,"Hotel, Ascot Vale, and a third at the Sur-",40
NA,"vey Hotel, Deepdene. Strangely enough,",40
NA,there are only seventy-nine slot payment,40
NA,telephones in Victoria.,40
Mr TUDOR ,I s that all the public tele-,40
NA,phones there are?,40
Dr LIDDELL ,Ther e appears to be,40
NA,a difference between slot payment tele-,40
NA,phones 'and telephone bureaux. The num-,40
NA,ber of public telephones could be advan-,40
NA,tageously increased i f storekeepers and,40
NA,others were encouraged to provide them for,40
NA,their customers. In New South Wales,40
NA,there are only fourteen slot payment tele-,40
NA,phones. There must be revenue to be de-,40
NA,"rived from the use of these machines, and",40
NA,yet the Department does not encourage,40
NA,them.,40
Mr TUDOR , I think that there are four,40
NA,at Circular Quay alone.,40
Dr LIDDELL ,Ther e is certainly,40
NA,"one at the Grosvenor Hotel, Church Hill,",40
NA,Sydney. There are also what are called,40
NA,public telephones. At the Hotel Austra-,40
NA,lia! there is a public office from which tele-,40
NA,"grams can be sent, and other postal busi-",40
NA,ness transacted. Yet we have the Post-,40
NA,"master-General saying that, on moral",40
NA,"grounds, he will not allow these instru-",40
NA,"ments to be used in hotels, lest any one",40
NA,should be encouraged to imbibe liquor. I n,40
NA,"New South Wales, there are public tele-",40
NA,phones at the following hotels:-Th e,40
NA,"Arcadia, the Australia, the Metropole, the",40
NA,"Wentworth, Tattersall's, the United Ser-",40
NA,"vice, and the Merrylands, at Holroyd. So",40
NA,"that, although the Department says that it",40
NA,"will not encourage hotel telephones, we",40
NA,"have, nevertheless, a series of public tele-",40
NA,phones at the principal hotels. One rea-,40
NA,-,40
NA,son given by the Department is that the,40
NA,establishment of slot telephones at hotels,40
NA,might prevent hotelkeepers from having,40
NA,private instruments. But the reply is that,40
NA,"if a hotelkeeper had a slot machine, and",40
NA,used it for his own purposes the Depart-,40
NA,ment would probably derive a larger revenue,40
NA,therefrom than it would do i f he paid for,40
NA,a private telephone. It is absolutely ridi-,40
NA,culous that we in Australia should not be,40
NA,as up-to-date in these matters as are other,40
NA,countries.,40
Mr MAUGER ,Ther e are States in,40
NA,America where the telephones are not per-,40
NA,mitted in hotels at all.,40
Dr LIDDELL ,Bu t the telephones in,40
NA,America are not run by the Government.,40
NA,"They are controlled by private companies,",40
NA,"and, to some extent, the people are ex-",40
NA,ploited. We want to prevent that kind of,40
NA,thing in Australia. I hope that I shall,40
NA,be able to persuade the Postmaster-General.,40
Mr MAUGER ,N o chance !,40
Dr LIDDELL ,Surel y the honorable,40
NA,member can recognise that these residential,40
NA,hotels are not drinking shops in back,40
NA,streets. The people who live at them should,40
NA,have reasonable conveniences of this kind,40
NA,placed at their disposal.,40
Mr COON ,Batman) [4.6] - I consider,40
NA,that there is something wrong with the ad.,40
NA,ministration of the Old-age Pensions De-,40
NA,partment. Otherwise people would not,40
NA,have to wait so long for an answer after,40
NA,making an application. When a police,40
NA,"magistrate has conducted an inquiry, and",40
NA,"recommended the granting of a pension,",40
NA,"the applicants are informed, often days, or",40
NA,"even weeks later, that the Department can-",40
NA,"not accede to the request. In some cases,",40
NA,no reason is given. I f the officers are,40
NA,"overworked, and cannot keep up with the",40
NA,"demands, steps should be taken by the",40
NA,"Treasurer to increase the staff, and to bring",40
NA,the work up-to-date. I trust that the,40
NA,Postmaster-General will convey to the,40
NA,Treasurer the protests that have been,40
NA,lodged by the honorable member for Mel-,40
NA,"bourne and others, with which I thoroughly",40
NA,agree.,40
Sir JOHN QUICK ,Bendigo-Post -,41
NA,master-General) [4.8] -Th e Treasurer,41
NA,"having been called away on urgent business,",41
NA,has requested me to make a note of mat-,41
NA,ters affecting his Department. With re-,41
NA,ference to the complaint of the honorable,41
NA,member for Melbourne regarding old-age,41
NA,"pensions, and particularly as to questions",41
NA,"put to applicants, and the ensuing 'delays,",41
NA,I may say that some time ago I did make,41
NA,a remark to the honorable member for,41
NA,Melbourne to the effect that I thought that,41
NA,the questions prescribed by the regulations,41
NA,were too numerous and complicated. I,41
NA,"mentioned the subject to the Commissioner,",41
NA,and talked it over with him. He pointed,41
NA,"out to me that the questions, which had",41
NA,"been framed by him, were necessary for",41
NA,"the purpose of protecting the Government,",41
NA,and particularly for the purpose of iden-,41
NA,tifying applicants. Particulars concerning,41
NA,"parentage, history, and so forth, were re-",41
NA,"quired, in order that persons might be",41
NA,traced. The questions are not put for any,41
NA,"other than public reasons, and to enable",41
NA,the Department to exercise a strict super-,41
NA,vision over the administration of the Act.,41
NA,The Commissioner assured me that i f he,41
NA,could see his way to recommend a modifica-,41
NA,tion of the regulations he would do so.,41
Dr MALONEY ,Wha t was the matter,41
NA,"with the Victorian system, under which penquisition",41
NA,sioners had not to answer any such questrates,41
NA,tions ?,41
Sir JOHN QUICK ,Th e CommonWe,41
NA,wealth system is more liberal than the Vicexclusively,41
NA,"torian system was. Moreover, the regulation",41
NA,tions had to be framed with a view to other,41
NA,old-age pension systems in Australia.,41
NA,"may have been found, from experience, the",41
NA,that the Victorian regulations were defecshown,41
NA,"tive. At air events, I have no doubt that",41
NA,the Commissioner considered that the reguance,41
NA,lations drawn up formed a perfect code.,41
NA,I should like the honorable member to,41
NA,collect that while the late Ministry was,41
NA,"solely responsible for the regulations,",41
NA,tainly the present Ministry is not. They,41
NA,were drawn up by the Chief Commissioner,41
NA,and his officers; and at the present time,41
NA,could not undertake to order a revision,41
NA,"modification of them, unless such a course",41
NA,were supported by the chief administrative,41
NA,officer -,41
Dr MALONEY ,H e is the.brute of the,41
NA,whole lot.,41
Sir JOHN QUICK ,Havin g had time,41
NA,to reconsider the opinion which I expressed,41
NA,"to the honorable member, I should not",41
NA,"to say now, in the light of the information",41
NA,"given to me, that the Chief Commissioner",41
NA,is wrong. I t is also to be remembered,41
NA,that many of the difficulties which have,41
NA,occurred were incidental to the initial stages,41
NA,of the working of the new Commonwealth,41
NA,"Act. They are merely initial difficulties,",41
NA,and' they will pass away. As people be-,41
NA,"come identified, and their rights to pen-",41
NA,"sions are established, it will not be neces-",41
NA,sary to go over the ground year after year.,41
NA,It will certainly be necessary to take pre-,41
NA,"cautions in dealing with each application,",41
NA,but the Department and the public will,41
NA,have become more familiar with the law.,41
NA,I have no doubt that the honorable mem-,41
NA,ber has rendered valuable assistance to a,41
NA,lot of these old people. We have all had,41
NA,to help them. I have had to introduce,41
NA,"claimants to my clerks, and to instruct",41
NA,them to draw out their forms of applica-,41
NA,"tion. They are certainly entitled to help,",41
NA,and I hope that the honorable member will,41
NA,accept my assurance that the regulations,41
NA,were not framed solely for the purpose of,41
NA,embarrassing or worrying claimants. They,41
NA,were drafted to insure legal projection.,41
NA,It may be that they have caused inconveni-,41
NA,"ence, but I hope that, with time and prac-",41
NA,"tice, that inconvenience will be found to",41
NA,grow less and less. As to the delay in,41
NA,"dealing with applications, it must be re-",41
NA,membered,41
NA,thethat we have had to call into re-,41
NA,services' of State police magis-,41
NA,in dealing with the vast array of,41
NA,claims. We are not their sole masters.,41
NA,cannot compel them to give their time,41
NA,and primarily to the investiga-,41
NA,"of these cases, and i f we had to em-",41
NA,ploy special officers for the work great ex-,41
NA,I t pense would be incurred. I believe that,41
NA,police magistrates of all the States have,41
NA,a disposition to deal promptly with,41
NA,applications consistently with the perform-,41
NA,of their other duties. A little con-,41
NA,sideration ought to be conceded to the police,41
NA,remagistrates who have these vast additional,41
NA,"not duties imposed upon them, and I trust that",41
NA,cerno honorable member will suggest that we,41
NA,"should employ special officers, and thereby",41
NA,add materially to the expense of adminis-,41
NA,we tering the Act. We have received from all,41
NA,or the States an assurance that the judicial,41
NA,officers intrusted with this duty are per-,41
NA,"forming it conscientiously, earnestly, and",41
NA,as expeditiously as possible. In Victoria,41
NA,nearly the whole of the applications have,41
NA,been dealt with. The work has been,41
NA,"grappled with in a splendid manner, and",41
NA,"is almost complete. In the other States, it",41
NA,"like may be that, owing to the many other",41
NA,"duties of the magistrates, it is not so well",42
NA,"advanced, but the Treasurer will make a",42
NA,note of the complaints that have been,42
NA,"voiced this afternoon, and will endeavour to",42
NA,expedite the work as much as possible. I,42
NA,am sorry to hear the complaint as to the,42
NA,non-acknowledgment of letters that have,42
NA,"been sent to the Department, but honorable",42
NA,members will recognise that the pressure of,42
NA,correspondence on the Old-age Pensions,42
NA,Office is enormous.,42
Mr TUDOR ,M y experience has not been,42
NA,that of the honorable member for Mel-,42
NA,bourne. I have received dozens of letters,42
NA,from the DeDartment.,42
Sir JOHN QUICK , I also have written,42
NA,"to the Department, and have received replies",42
NA,within a reasonable time. There may be,42
NA,special circumstances to account for the,42
NA,delay in certain instances. I can assure,42
NA,"honorable members, however, that the Trea-",42
NA,surer will make inquiries into this com-,42
NA,plaint. The valuation of properties is un-,42
NA,doubtedly a complicated matter. I have,42
NA,had brought under my own notice a case in,42
NA,which a police magistrate adopted the,42
NA,"municipal valuation, and have obtained, in",42
NA,"one case, evidence that the municipal valua-",42
NA,tion was excessive. The Old-age Pensions,42
NA,Commissioner is not bound by the municipal,42
NA,"valuation of properties, although a police",42
NA,magistrate may consider that he is. In one,42
NA,case within my own knowledge the Com-,42
NA,"missioner has reviewed a valuation, and has",42
NA,reduced it in favour of the claimant. No,42
NA,"doubt, i f honorable members will take the",42
NA,trouble to bring proper evidence before the,42
NA,"Commissioner, he will review every case-",42
NA,"as he is entitled, as an appellate officer to",42
NA,"do^-upon its merits, and will not neces-",42
NA,sarily be bound by either municipal valua-,42
NA,tions or those fixed by a police magistrate.,42
Dr MALONEY ,Doe s not the honorable,42
NA,member think that a claimant for an old-,42
NA,age pension should receive an acknowledg-,42
NA,ment of his application?,42
Sir JOHN QUICK , I am not aware of,42
NA,any instance in which an acknowledgment,42
NA,has not been received. The honorable,42
NA,member for Corio referred to the deficiency,42
NA,in bayonets for rifles. Th.e Minister of,42
NA,Defence has authorized me to say that he,42
NA,"has ordered 28,000 bayonets, to be pro-",42
NA,"vided as soon as possible, and that he ex-",42
NA,pects that upon their arrival the cause of,42
NA,the complaint will disappear. As to the use,42
NA,"of telephones in hotels, to which the honor-",42
NA,"able member for Hunter has referred, I",42
NA,"have little to add, and do not think it ad-",42
NA,"visable, at this late stage of the sitting, to",42
NA,[M7],42
NA,enter upon a full discussion of the question.,42
NA,I believe that it has been the practice of,42
NA,the Department since Federation not to in-,42
NA,crease the number of slot-payment tele-,42
NA,"phones in hotels, and I thoroughly approve",42
NA,of that practice as a whole. The honor-,42
NA,able member has mentioned several hotels-,42
NA,that are in possession of slot-payment tele-,42
NA,phones. It may be that they were pro-,42
NA,vided under the State system before Fede-,42
NA,ration.,42
Dr MALONEY , I know of one that was,42
NA,not.,42
Sir JOHN QUICK , I can offer no ex-,42
NA,planation of particular instances. Of late,42
NA,"years, at all events, the Department has",42
NA,refused to increase the number of slot-pay-,42
NA,"ment telephones in hotels, on the ground",42
NA,that it is not desirable or proper to do so.,42
NA,Although there may be no objection to slot-,42
NA,payment telephones being fixed in high-,42
NA,"class hotels, it would be hard to discrimi-",42
NA,nate. I f we began to extend the system we,42
NA,should have applications from every hotel-,42
NA,"keeper in the country, on the ground that",42
NA,"his was a respectable residential house, and ©",42
NA,it would be difficult to refuse any. I cer-,42
NA,tainly approve of the proposition that the,42
NA,Department should popularize and extend,42
NA,the use of slot-payment telephones where-,42
NA,ever there is no serious objection to their,42
NA,establishment. We have caused special in-,42
NA,quiries to be made in Melbourne as to locali-,42
NA,"ties where they may be established, and their",42
NA,number has been largely increased. I am,42
NA,surprised to hear that there are only four-,42
NA,teen in New South'Wales. I t seems almost,42
NA,"incredible; but i f the statement be correct,",42
NA,I shall cause the Deputy Postmaster-,42
NA,General in New South Wales to submit sug-,42
NA,gestions as to suitable places in which they,42
NA,may be established there as in Victoria.,42
Mr THOMAS BROWN ,Ar e they public,42
NA,telephones ?,42
Sir JOHN QUICK ,Yes ; Depart-,42
NA,mental telephones.,42
Mr THOMAS BROWN , I think that there,42
NA,must be more than fourteen public tele-,42
NA,phones in Sydney alone.,42
Dr LIDDELL ,I took the figures from,42
NA,the Postal Guide.,42
Mr THOMAS BROWN , A distinction may,42
NA,be made by the Department between slot-,42
NA,pavment and public telephones.,42
Sir JOHN QUICK , I shall inquire,42
NA,into the statement made by the honorable,42
NA,member for Hunter. It is my desire to,42
NA,extend and popularize the use of slot-pay-,42
NA,"ment telephones, and I think that may be",42
NA,done witnout establishing them in hotels.,42
NA,Hotel proprietors can have as many tele-,43
NA,phone instruments' as they are willing to pay,43
NA,for. We do not limit them. Either Men-,43
NA,zies' Hotel or the Grand Hotel or Scott's,43
NA,Hotel can get as many subscribers' - instru-,43
NA,ments as they think fit. No limitation is,43
NA,imposed. What we do object to is that,43
NA,they should call upon the Department to,43
NA,establish Departmental telephones in any,43
NA,hotels further than they have been estab-,43
NA,lished. Let them get as many subscribers',43
NA,"telephones as they think fit, and, i f they",43
NA,their guests and others can use the instru-,43
NA,"ments on payment of a penny, provided that",43
NA,"it is under the toll system, but, of course,",43
NA,if it is tmder the slot system,43
Mr MAUGER ,I t must be under the toll,43
NA,svstem now.,43
Sir JOHN QUICK ,"Yes , all the new-",43
NA,telephones are under the toll system.,43
NA,do not see how even these high-class hotels,43
NA,are interfered with by the Departmental,43
NA,regulation. I fail to see why they should,43
NA,ask us to extend Departmental telephones,43
NA,for the use of themselves and their patrons,43
NA,and customers. Thev should remember,43
NA,that i f we establish Departmental slot-,43
NA,payment telephones in their hotels every,43
NA,member of the public will have the right,43
NA,to have access to them. They could not,43
NA,reserve their use exclusively for their cus-,43
NA,tomers and patrons.',43
NA,NA,43
NA,discriminate between high-class and low-,43
NA,class hotels?,43
Sir JOHN QUICK ,Tha t is the diffi-,43
NA,culty. I should not like to be called,43
NA,upon to draw a line and say what applica-,43
NA,tion should be refused and what applica-,43
NA,tion should be granted. I do not think it,43
NA,is desirable to extend the number of public,43
NA,"telephones in hotels, nor do I think that",43
NA,the revenue will suffer from our action. I f,43
NA,the demand in any hotel is sufficiently,43
NA,"great, the proprietor has his remedy bv",43
NA,applying for a subscriber's instrument.,43
NA,Any number of subscribers' instruments,43
NA,will be conceded to the hotels on the toll,43
NA,system. In that way their customers will,43
NA,"be accommodated, and the revenue will be",43
NA,protected and promoted.,43
Mr THOMAS BROWN ,Calare) [4.23].,43
NA,- I desire to again bring before the House,43
NA,the great difliculty which old-age pensioners,43
NA,in remote country districts experience under,43
NA,the present arrangements in getting their,43
NA,payments made to them. Some days ago,43
NA,I brought the matter under the notice of,43
NA,"the Treasurer, and showed that pensioners",43
NA,had to travel from a post-office to a,43
NA,money-order office-a distance of from,43
NA,20 to 26 miles-in order to have their,43
NA,payments made. I suggested that the diffi-,43
NA,culty might be largely overcome by having,43
NA,the payment of a pension made at any post-,43
NA,"office, irrespective of whether or not it was",43
NA,a money-order office. The Treasurer,43
NA,gave me to understand that I wns labouring,43
NA,"under a misapprehension, and that what I",43
NA,suggested was the practice of the Depart-,43
NA,ment. I have here a typical case which,43
NA,"do, I should like to have specially brought",43
NA,under his notice. In the Sydney Worker,43
NA,of the 23rd September the following jetter,43
NA,"appeared under the heading of "" Callous",43
NA,"Treatment of Old-Age Pensioners "" :-",43
NA,"Dear Worker,",43
NA,I wish to bring under your notice a matter,43
NA,in connexion with the payment of my old-age,43
NA,pension which presses heavily on one of mv,43
NA,"I years, and as there are no doubt many hundred's",43
NA,"similarly placed to myself, I trust this publicity",43
NA,of the circumstances will be the means of bring-,43
NA,ing some redress of our grievance.,43
NA,"Now, sir, from Humula where I reside, to",43
NA,"Tarcutta, to which place I have to go for my",43
NA,"pension, is 18 miles. To make this journey",43
NA,once a month on a very slow old horse was,43
NA,"quite enough, but this change once a fortnight",43
NA,"is too severe? I spoke, to a friend and asked",43
NA,him i f he could do something for me. He,43
NA,kindly offered to draw my pension money for,43
NA,"me, and I went back to Humula feeling very",43
NA,grateful and glad. But later on our constable,43
NA,informed me the warrant had been returned to,43
NA,"him, as the gentleman referred to above could",43
NA,"not l i f t my money for me, as all storekeepers",43
NA,and business people were barred from drawing,43
NA,"a pensioner's money. Now, sir, Humula is a",43
NA,"village, and one may stand at the post-office",43
NA,"or police station, and count thirty houses, so I",43
NA,ask can nothing be done that we old pensioners,43
NA,could draw our money in Humula post-office.,43
NA,> JOHN MORGAN.,43
NA,To that letter this footnote was appended,43
NA,by the editor-,43
NA,"We have brought this case, typical, unfortu-",43
NA,"nately, of many hundreds of others of our old",43
NA,"folk in the backblocks, under the notice of Mr.",43
NA,"Clegg, the Registrar of old-age pensions in",43
NA,Sydney. Mr Clegg explained that our corre-,43
NA,spondent has to make such a long journey ow-,43
NA,ing to the fact that there is probably no money-,43
NA,order office at which the pensions are made pay-,43
NA,able nearer than Tarcutta. Should there be one,43
NA,"nearer, - the Department in this, and in anv",43
NA,"similar cases, will gladly meet the wishes of",43
NA,the applicant. I t frequently happens that a,43
NA,post-office is not a money-order office. I f it,43
NA,is preferred the pension will be paid monthly,43
NA,to obviate the necessity of making the fort-,43
NA,nightly journey.,43
NA,While the Worker believes that the officers are,43
NA,willing to assist the old-age pensioners to the,43
NA,"f u l l extent of their present powers, it is scan-",43
NA,dalous that some more humane system has not,43
NA,been devised by the responsible heads of the,43
NA,"Department which will enable pensioners, like",43
NA,"our correspondent, to draw their money without",43
NA,"having to make a journey which, to. those placed",44
NA,"as he ia, is nothing short of the infliction of",44
NA,downright cruelty.,44
NA,The letter is on similar lines to a number,44
NA,which I have received! from my constituents.,44
NA,Apparently the Department have no general,44
NA,scheme by which payments can be made at,44
NA,post-offices other than money-order offices.,44
NA,In this case the old man had to travel from,44
NA,a post-office in a little town with a police,44
NA,station and other advantages to the neaicst,44
NA,"money-order office, 18 miles away, in order",44
NA,"to get his payments made, and what ap-",44
NA,plies to his case applies to hundreds of,44
NA,others.,44
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I know that the,44
NA,Treasurer has the matter under considera-,44
NA,tion.,44
Mr THOMAS BROWN , J asked the,44
NA,Treasurer some questions and he gave me,44
NA,"to understand that I was misinformed, and",44
NA,that the condition of affairs I was pointing,44
NA,out did not exist. I again bring this mat-,44
NA,"ter under the notice of the Government, and",44
NA,I trust that some means will be devised to,44
NA,"meet a very serious position, and obviate the",44
NA,cruelty of requiring the pensioners to travel,44
NA,long distances.,44
NA,Question resolved in the affirmative.,44
NA,House adjourned at 4.28 p.m.,44

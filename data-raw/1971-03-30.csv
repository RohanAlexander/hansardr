NA,State of Victoria respectfully sheweth:,14
NA,1. The red kangaroo and many other mar-,14
NA,"supials, through shooting for commercial",14
NA,"purposes, have been reduced to a numerical",14
NA,level where their survival is in jeopardy.,14
NA,2. None of the Australian States have sufficient,14
NA,wardens to detect and apprehend people,14
NA,"breaking the laws in existence in each State,",14
NA,and in such a vast country only uniform,14
NA,laws and a complete cessation of com-,14
NA,mercialisation can ensure the survival of our,14
NA,national emblem.,14

NA,resource can withstand hunting on such a,14
NA,"' concentrated scale, unless some provision is",14
NA,made for its future.,14
NA,"We, your petitioners, therefore humbly pray that:",14
NA,The export of all kangaroo products be banned,14
NA,immediately and the Commonwealth Government,14

NA,the State of Victoria respectfully sheweth:,14
NA,ELECTORAL That because of uncontrolled shooting for,14
NA,"commercial purposes, the population of kangaroos,",14
NA,"particularly the big red species is now so low,",14
NA,that they may become extinct.,14
NA,There are insufficient wardens in any State of,14
NA,the Commonwealth to detect or apprehend those,14
NA,who break the inadequate laws which exist. As a,14
NA,"tourist attraction, the kangaroo is a permanent",14
NA,source of revenue to this country.,14
NA,It is an indisputable fact that no species can,14
NA,"withstand hunting on such a scale, when there is",14
NA,"no provision being made for its future. We, your",14
NA,"petitioners, therefore humbly pray, that:",14
NA,The export of kangaroo products be banned,14
NA,"immediately, and the Commonwealth Government",14
NA,take the necessary steps to have all wildlife in,14
NA,Australia brought under its control.,14
NA,Only a complete cessation of killing for com-,14

Mr SPEAKER,I s leave granted?,16
Mr MCMAHON ,No .,16
Mr SPEAKER,Leav e is not granted.,16
NA,TARIFF ON TRUCK PARTS,16
Mr WHITLAM , I ask the Miuister for,16
NA,Trade ancl Industry a question. I apprehend,16
NA,that the honourable gentleman will not,16
NA,"again tell me, as he did on Wednesday",16
NA,"week, that he is not aware of the decision",16
NA,to cancel tariff concessions on a wide range,16
NA,of commercial vehicle components from,16
NA,1st October next. I also apprehend that he,16
NA,will remember that the Minister for Cus-,16
NA,toms and Excise thereupon said that a sub-,16
NA,mission wns presently before Cabinet.,16
NA,"Accordingly, I ask again: What is the justi-",16
NA,fication in the present circumstances for a,16
NA,decision which' willso obviously increase,16
NA,the costs of all those who use trucks in,16
NA,"primary production, in manufacturing",16
NA,enterprises and in transport businesses?,16
Mr ANTHONY,Th e other day when I,16
NA,answered a question on this matter from,16
NA,the Leader of the Opposition 1 was,16
NA,unaware of the facts. It is true that there,16
NA,had been discussions between the Depart-,16
NA,ment of Customs ancl Excise and thc,16
NA,"Department of Trade and Industry, and",16
NA,indeed a note had been prepared for mc,16
NA,but I had not seen it at that stage. Thc,16
NA,matter has been raised in the House by,16
NA,the Minister for Customs and Excise.,16
NA,He gave an answer detailing his responsi-,16
NA,bilities in the application of by-law and the,16
NA,cancellation of any by-law that might,16
NA,exist. What he said was proper and correct.,16
NA,The matter now has been studied by the,16
NA,Government and it has endorsed the action,16
NA,of the Minister for Customs and Excise.,16
NA,The action is merely the application of thc,16
NA,long-standing principle that rales of,16
NA,decided by the Tariff Board should applv,16
NA,to protected - Australian produced goods,16
NA,when they are a suitable equivalent for,16
NA,goods produced overseas and when they are,16
NA,reasonably available.. The effect of the,16
NA,cellation of tbe by-law on costs of finished,16
NA,commercial vehicles has yet to be seen.,16
NA,However I would like to quote what the,16
NA,Tariff Board had to say in 1965. I t said:,16
NA,. . . The performance of at least one manu-,16
NA,facturer suggests that a significantly higher local,16
NA,content may not mean appreciably higher costs of,16
NA,commercial vehicle production where large,16
NA,volumes of production are concerned.,16
NA,The following extract from the same report,16
NA,by the Tariff Board is also worth noting:,16
NA,When the problem is examined in more detail at a,16
NA,later date the Board would expect to see that the,16
NA,local contents of commercial vehicles as normally,16
NA,sold by vehicle builders have been raised to higher,16
NA,levels.,16
NA,It is very hard to determine at this early,16
NA,stage just what the effects of additional,16
NA,"costs will be, but one must say that the",16
NA,action by the Minister for Customs and,16
NA,Excise is consistent with established policy.,16
NA,It was taken after detailed examination by,16
NA,his Department and in consultation with Ihe,16
NA,"industry, with both the component manu-",16
NA,facturers and the users of those components.,16
NA,It is in conformity with the expressed,16
NA,"expectations of the Tariff Board and, as I",16
NA,"mentioned previously, has been endorsed",16
NA,by the Government.,16
NA,RURAL DIVERSIFICATION,16
Mr MCLEAY, I ask the Minister for,16
NA,Trade and Industry whether his attention,16
NA,has been drawn to the recent debate in,16
NA,this House on the loan to the Australian,16
NA,Wheat Board and the references to his own,16
NA,speech when opening the Agricultural Out-,16
NA,look Conference this year. Is any action,16
NA,"being taken by the Minister's Department,",16
NA,the departments of agriculture in the States,16
NA,or the Commonwealth Scientific and In-,16
NA,dustrial Research Organisation to conduct,16
NA,research into and encourage wheat farmers,16
NA,to diversify and to undertake the produc-,16
NA,tion and export of other grain? Has the,16
NA,"production of edible oil seed, for which",16
NA,there is a world-wide demand and which is,16
NA,imported into Australia in considerable,16
NA,"quantities, even been subjected to such an",16
NA,analysis?,16
Mr ANTHONY,Wit h the application,16
NA,duty of the wheat quotas there is indeed,16
NA,encouragement to wheat growers to try to,16
NA,diversify and engage in other types of crop-,16
NA,ping. I did mention at the Agricultural,16
NA,Outlook Conference that there were oppor-,16
NA,cantunities for diversification although they,16
NA,were not limitless. Certainly in the oil seed,16
NA,industry there is a chance for further,16
NA,development and expansion but this must,17
NA,be measured against the domestic require-,17
NA,ments and the economic attractiveness of,17
NA,"producing such crops. However, at the",17
NA,moment there does appear to be sufficient,17
NA,local demand to require further production.,17
NA,I know the area for oil seed production has,17
NA,increased quite dramatically in recent years.,17
NA,"It is now up to something like 400,000",17
NA,"acres, but it appears there is still further",17
NA,room for increased production.,17
NA,TRI-SERVICE ACADEMY,17
Mr BARNARD, 1 ask the Minister for,17
NA,Defence whether his Department's submis-,17
NA,sion on the establishment of a tri-Service,17
NA,academy has been redrafted as directed by,17
NA,"Cabinet last October? If so, when will",17
NA,revised plans for the college be approved?,17
NA,Is the Minister now satisfied that abolition,17
NA,of the present system of individual Service,17
NA,colleges is justified? Can he give the House,17
NA,any estimate of savings involved in integrat-,17
NA,ing the 3 colleges? Will the delay in approv-,17
NA,ing the proposal mean that the academy,17
NA,will not be ready to take officer cadets from,17
NA,all 3 Services until 1975 or later?,17
Mr GORTON,"A s indicated previously,",17
NA,the Government required more informa-,17
NA,"tion, more detailed information, and a good",17
NA,deal more facts presented to it before it felt,17
NA,it could have proper grounds to take a,17
NA,decision that a tri-Service college should,17
NA,be established. Consequently the Depart-,17
NA,ment of Defence was asked to make further,17
NA,studies and put forward a further submis-,17
NA,sion to Cabinet. I understand that those,17
NA,studies have been undertaken and that a,17
NA,"submission, which has not yet come to me,",17
NA,has been virtually prepared. That is all I can,17
NA,tell the honourable member because I can-,17
NA,not tell him whether or not it will be,17
NA,approved by Cabinet when it does come,17
NA,before the Government.,17
NA,WINE EXCISE,17
Mr GILES, I address my question to,17
NA,the Minister for Primary Industry. May I,17
NA,say initially that I am grateful to the,17
NA,Minister and to the Minister for Customs,17
NA,and Excise for the consideration they have,17
NA,shown me in respect of the matter I am,17
NA,about to mention. Has the Minister noticed,17
NA,any trends in recent wine sales relating to,17
NA,price sensitivity on the one hand and,17
NA,flagon sales on the other? Has he,17
NA,"been able to discern, from any of his",17
NA,"inquiries, any significance in these figures?",17
NA,"Finally, in thanking him for the considera-",17
NA,tion shown to me personally recently I ask:,17
NA,Is there any further suggestion he can make,17
NA,about improving the Government's know-,17
NA,ledge of these matters of great concern to,17
NA,the wine industry?,17
Mr SINCLAIR, I know that the hon-,17
NA,ourable gentleman has expressed on fre-,17
NA,quent occasions in this House and in the,17
NA,"Murray Valley basin, for which he exer-",17
NA,"cises quite a deal of electoral'responsibility,",17
NA,his concern at the impact of excise on wine,17
NA,and grape producers insofar as it apparently,17
NA,"has, in the minds of those who are grow-",17
NA,"ers, affected their markets and fheir returns.",17
NA,Similarly I know that other honourable,17
NA,"members, particularly fhe'honourable mem-",17
NA,"ber for Mallee, have raised this question",17
NA,with me. 1 am happy to advise the honour-,17
NA,able member that since he last asked me,17
NA,"a question in this House, further inquiries",17
NA,have been made about the'impact of excise,17
NA,on producers' returns and it seems statisti-,17
NA,cally there is no direct evidence that there,17
NA,has been any reduction in outlets this year,17
NA,compared with the same period last year.,17
NA,From a study that my colleague the,17
NA,Minister for Customs and Excise initiated,17
NA,"in respect of some 10 wine producers, I",17
NA,am told that there is'still'no direct evi-,17
NA,dence available of an impact. 'Four of these,17
NA,wine producers are co-operatives. I am told,17
NA,that in respect of one'of'them it appears,17
NA,that the direct problem I s ' a marketing,17
NA,problem rather than a problem consequen-,17
NA,tial on the imposition of excise. The Prime,17
NA,Minister has been in contact with me and,17
NA,has expressed his concern that there should,17
NA,1,17
NA,be full knowledge of the circumstances,17
NA,"surrounding the impact of excise and, as",17
NA,"a result, an interdepartmental committee",17
NA,will be constituted to inquire into all the,17
NA,circumstances surrounding the excise and,17
NA,its application. I am sure that the honour-,17
NA,able member's representations will be kept,17
NA,closely in mind.,17
NA,HOSPITAL. COSTS,17
Mr KENNEDY, I address a question lo,17
NA,the Prime Minister. Has the Common-,17
NA,wealth bed subsidy to hospitals declined as,17
NA,a percentage of all hospital costs since the,17
NA,subsidy was first introduced? Have hospital,17
NA,costs risen faster than other costs during the,17
NA,same period? Do the States find it more,17
NA,difficult to finance their hospitals adequately,18
NA,than the Commonwealth finds it to subsidise,18
NA,its own hospitals? Is the Prime Minister con-,18
NA,cerned with the crisis facing hospitals? Will,18
NA,he take steps to remove or relieve this crisis,18
Mr MCMAHON, 1 will obtain the ans-,18
NA,"wer from the Minister for Health, who is in",18
NA,"the other chamber, and let the honourable",18
NA,member know.,18
NA,PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA,18
Mr MAISEY,I s the Minister for Trade,18
NA,and Industry aware of the magnitude of,18
NA,problem confronting the People's Republic,18
NA,of China in its efforts to gainfully employ,18
NA,and raise the living standards of its vast,18
NA,population? ls he conversant with the policy,18
NA,of that Government to purchase raw,18
NA,materials in their most basic form and,18
NA,cess them into a finished article for presentacome,18
NA,"tion to world markets, in conformity with",18
NA,the need to provide maximum employment,18
NA,opportunities? Will the Minister,18
NA,Australian Wool Commission to send a mis-,18
NA,"sion, comprising persons fully qualified and",18
NA,experienced in wool selling and processing,18
NA,techniques as well as at least one person,18
NA,"skilled in handling and arranging finance,",18
NA,to the People's Republic of China with a,18
NA,view to selling direct to its Government wool,18
NA,from the stockpile presently held by the,18
NA,"Commission? Furthermore, because of the",18
NA,"meticulous manner, in which the Chinese",18
NA,have honoured their commitments in the,18
NA,"purchase of Australian wheat on credit, will",18
NA,the Minister authorise this mission to enter,18
NA,"into credit transactions, if required, on much",18
NA,the same terms of payment as have been,18
NA,successfully negotiated by the Australian,18
NA,"Wheat Board? Finally, in the review and",18
NA,restructuring of the Australian Tariff Board,18
NA,will the Minister give consideration to offeroutside,18
NA,ing advantages to Chinese exports in return,18
NA,for contracts for the purchase of Australian,18
NA,wool?,18
Mr ANTHONY,Th e honourable memmonwealth,18
NA,ber's question was long and interesting,18
NA,"and had many facets to it. In fact, I think",18
NA,some of them infringed a little on Governtralia.,18
NA,ment policy. The first point that I want,18
NA,make is that it has been a long-standing,18
NA,principle accepted by this Government that,18
NA,commodities produced remain the property ticular,18
NA,of the people who produce them. For sealing,18
NA,"instance, Australian wheat is sold under",18
NA,the jurisdiction and management of the,18
NA,"Australian Wheat Board, and this has been",18
NA,the body which has initiated and been able,18
NA,to successfully negotiate sales to the,18
NA,People's Republic of China. In the case of,18
NA,"wool, I would certainly not give a direction",18
NA,"to the Australian Wool Board, or to any",18
NA,"other group, to send representatives to",18
NA,China in order to try to sell wool,18
NA,"there, but what I would be quite happy to",18
NA,"do is to consult my colleague, the Minister",18
NA,"for Primary Industry, on the question",18
NA,which the honourable member has raised.,18
NA,It would be of interest for him to know,18
NA,thc that members of the Australian Wool Com-,18
NA,mission would have been overseas dis-,18
NA,cussing with some countries with state-,18
NA,controlled economies the possibility of buy-,18
NA,ing wool from Australia on a negotiated,18
NA,arrangement. I know that discussions have,18
NA,protaken place but I am not aware of the out-,18
NA,of them. I will certainly discuss the,18
NA,question that the honourable member has,18
NA,Drought up with my colleague the Minister,18
NA,request the for Primary Industry.,18
NA,EYRE HIGHWAY,18
Mr BENNETT,M y question is directed,18
NA,to the Minister for Shipping and Transport.,18
NA,In view of the recent ministerial and Gov-,18
NA,"ernment rearrangement, will he give urgent",18
NA,consideration to presenting again to Cabinet,18
NA,the proposal for special Government funds,18
NA,to be made available for the purpose of,18
NA,effecting the early completion of the sealing,18
NA,"of the Eyre Highway? Further, will he, if",18
NA,"he has not already done so, inspect the",18
NA,unsealed portion of the highway-prefer-,18
NA,ably by driving over it-s o that he will be,18
NA,fully aware of the problem?,18
Mr NIXON,Thi s matter has been,18
NA,raised from time to time both inside and,18
NA,this House. On previous occasions,18
NA,I have given the answer to honourable,18
NA,members who have raised the question that,18
NA,the Commonwealth provision for the,18
NA,sealing of roads is made through the Com-,18
NA,Aid Roads Act. The honour-,18
NA,able member refers to that portion,18
NA,of the Eyre Highway that is in South Aus-,18
NA,The South Australian Government,18
NA,to has had assistance to the extent of about,18
NA,$125m from the Commonwealth for roads,18
NA,purposes. The initiative for sealing any par-,18
NA,road and setting the priorities for the,18
NA,of roads lies with the State Govern-,18
NA,ment. So in this case it is a matter for the,18

NA,what roads it wants to seal and in what,19
NA,order those roads will be sealed.,19
NA,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY,19
Mr HAMER,M y question is directed,19
NA,to the Minister for the Navy. Is the Min-,19
NA,ister aware of the closing of the White,19
NA,Ensign Club in Melbourne? Does the Min-,19
NA,ister agree that the Navy has a special,19
NA,"responsibility for the welfare of its sailors,",19
NA,some of whom are as young as 16 years,19
NA,and are far from their homes? Will he see,19
NA,that suitable cheap respectable accommo-,19
NA,dation is available in Melbourne for such,19
NA,"sailors on leave, if necessary by subsidy",19
NA,from public funds?,19
Dr MACKAY,Th e White Ensign Club,19
NA,"in Victoria is, to the best of my know-",19
NA,"ledge, intended to be a self-supporting instipolicy.",19
NA,"tution. It has, over recent years, been",19
NA,steadily losing money mainly because,19
NA,sailors' habits with regard to spending,19
NA,their weekends ashore have changed some-,19
NA,what. As a result the Club has gone into,19
NA,"debt to the extent of between $20,000 and",19
NA,"$30,000 and it has been decided to wind",19
NA,up the affairs of the Club. The Common-,19
NA,wealth has made a considerable gesture,19
NA,towards meeting this debt. The Navy Can-,19
NA,"teen Fund has contributed $5,000 and has",19
NA,indicated that it will stand by with other,19
NA,sums if necessary. Having regard to the,19
NA,honourable member's concern for young,19
NA,sailors I point out that HMAS 'Lonsdale',19
NA,provides accommodation if it is required.,19
NA,The sailors' clubs at HMAS 'Flinders' also,19
NA,provide for these young men. At HMAS,19
NA,"'Leeuwin', in Western Australia, there is",19
NA,an excellent scheme of sponsorship whereby,19
NA,members of the public may look after,19
NA,young sailors. In the light of the honourable,19
NA,member's question I will have inquiries,19
NA,made about the number of personnel who,19
NA,may be involved and if it is substantial the,19
NA,matter will certainly get close attention.,19
NA,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT,19
Mr MARTIN,M y question is addressed,19
NA,to the Minister for Housing. Is it a fact,19
NA,that the grant made under the ' Homes,19
NA,Savings Grant Act is restricted to eligible,19
NA,applicants who build or acquire a home,19
NA,"the total cost of which is less than $17,500,",19
NA,including the cost of the land? Is the Minis-,19
NA,ter aware that it is impossible to obtain,19
NA,a reasonable home in the capital cities for,19
NA,"less than $17,500? Because of this is it a",19
NA,fact that the homes savings grant is not,19
NA,being paid to a large number of young,19
NA,married people who are otherwise eligible,19
NA,for the grant? What does the Minister in-,19
NA,tend to do to rectify this anomalous situa-,19
NA,tion?,19
Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,I t is correct that,19
NA,an upper limit is placed on the value of a,19
NA,house which is the subject of a homes,19
NA,savings grant. Representations have been,19
NA,made from time to time to increase this,19
NA,value. It is also correct to say that payments,19
NA,by the Commonwealth under the homes,19
NA,savings grant scheme have been increasing,19
NA,within recent years. The' honourable mem-,19
NA,ber will appreciate that any alteration to,19
NA,the limit in the value of a home in respect,19
NA,of which a grant is sought is a matter of,19
NA,INDUSTRIAL UNREST,19
Mr BUCHANAN, I .'direct a question,19
NA,to the Minister for Labour and National,19
NA,Service. As one of the thousands of people,19
NA,"who were inconvenienced., by a strike last",19
NA,week by some members..of the Federated,19
NA,Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association,19
NA,at the State Electricity Commission's plant,19
NA,at Morwell I ask: Will the Minister give,19
NA,the House the facts of this strike? Was the,19
NA,public once again made the victim in a,19
NA,"needless, costly strike which should not",19
NA,have occurred and which was one of a series,19
NA,of incidents in which ihe unions have,19
NA,proved powerless to discipline their own,19
NA,members?,19
Mr LYNCH,Strik e action by approxi-,19
NA,mately 140 members of the Federated,19
NA,Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association,19
NA,employed at the Morwell. open cut did take,19
NA,place on 23rd March and continued until,19
NA,:,19
NA,12 noon on 26th March. I understand that,19
NA,the men concerned were dissatisfied with,19
NA,a recent decision by Conciliation Com-,19
NA,missioner Brack to increase..their site allow-,19
NA,ance by $1.25. Clearly the facts of the,19
NA,situation are these: As a consequence of,19
NA,this irresponsible action by a .very small,19
NA,number of men in one of this country's,19
NA,"major industrial plants some 200,000",19
NA,"workers were thrown out, of work with a",19
NA,loss in wages of approximately $4m and a,19
NA,loss in production exceeding $12m. The,19
NA,House may reflect on the serious incon-,19
NA,venience which this strike caused to the,19
NA,Victorian community and its many in-,20
NA,dustries which are dependent on a con-,20
NA,tinuous flow of power for their plants. In,20
NA,addition the men concerned dishonoured an,20
NA,agreement made on their behalf and for a,20
NA,period of 3 days were apparently prepared,20
NA,to go their own way regardless of the con-,20
NA,sequences. As the honourable member,20
NA,"observed, this was in fact a needless strike",20
NA,at great expense to the public. It was not,20
NA,productive as far as the men were con-,20
NA,cerned. It should not have occurred. This,20
NA,was one of a series of incidents which,20
NA,clearly shows the problems which arise,20
NA,when unions are unable to discipline effec-,20
NA,tively their members. I might say that Com-,20
NA,misioner Brack has agreed to re-open the,20
NA,"hearing on the site allowance, on an applica-",20
NA,tion by the Federated Engine Drivers ancl,20
NA,"Firemen's Association, and that hearing will",20
NA,take place shortly.,20
NA,Finally. I might observe that d uring,20
NA,course of 1970 the number of industrial the situation.,20
NA,"disputes in this country was some 2,700,",20
NA,which was an increase of 35 per cent over,20
NA,the number for the preceding year. That,20
NA,situation is clearly inimical to the public,20
NA,interest and is a major inhibiting factor to,20
NA,the attainment of the productivity objectives,20
NA,of this Government.,20
NA,F i l l AIRCRAFT,20
Mr HANSEN,M y question is directed,20
NA,to the Minister for Repatriation in his,20
NA,capacity as the Minister in this chamber,20
NA,representing the Minister for Air. I ask:,20
NA,what extent is the Australian Government,20
NA,responsible for costs connected with the,20
NA,coming vijiit to Australia of F i l l aircraft,20
NA,belonging to the United States,20
NA,What resemblance is there between these,20
NA,aircraft and the aircraft which Australia,20
NA,"ordered, as an urgent defence necessity,",20
NA,1963? Will the Royal Australian Air Force,20
NA,receive the 1963 version or a later and,20
NA,proved model of the aircraft when delivery,20
NA,eventually is made?,20
Mr HOLTEN, I will refer the honouradhere,20
NA,able member's question to my colleague,20
NA,another place.,20
Mr KING,Ha s the Minister for,20
NA,mary Industry read a report of alleged,20
NA,changes in support for the buying-in,20
NA,vities of the Australian Wool Commission?,20
NA,"If so, will he explain the present position,",20
NA,having in mind the critical circumstances,20
NA,of the Australian wool industry at this,20
NA,"time, and the effect which the present",20
NA,price of about 30c per lb or below has on,20
NA,the profitability of wool growing?,20
Mr SINCLAIR,Som e rumours have,20
NA,been circulating about alleged Cabinet deci-,20
NA,sions regarding the activities of the Aus-,20
NA,"tralian Wool Commission. First of all, in",20
NA,answer to the honourable member's ques-,20
NA,tion I emphasise that there has been no,20
NA,change in the Government's policy regard-,20
NA,ing the purchase of wool by the Australian,20
NA,"Wool Commission. Indeed, over the past",20
NA,"week prices for wool have remained firm,",20
NA,and there has been a reduction in the pass-,20
NA,ing-in rate from an average of between 22,20
NA,"and 25 per cent to 18.5 per cent. Secondly,",20
NA,bearing in mind the seriousness of the,20
NA,"present wool marketing situation, the Go-",20
NA,vernment will continue to keep under con-,20
NA,the stant review all factors which may affect,20
NA,RHODESIA,20
Mr WHITLAM,"M y question, which I",20
NA,"address to the Prime Minister, relates to",20
NA,his Government's attitude to the regime in,20
NA,Rhodesia ancl arises from the recent visit,20
NA,to Rhodesia as guests of the regime by 3,20
NA,"Government senators, including the new",20
NA,Minister for Health. I ask the right honour-,20
NA,"able gentleman whether, in view of these",20
NA,visits and his appointment of one of the,20
NA,"visitors to the Ministry, he will repeat the",20
NA,"assurance which he, as Minister for Exter-",20
NA,"To nal Affairs, gave a year ago to the honour-",20
NA,able member for Bradfield that the Gov-,20
NA,ernment has 'no intention of giving any,20
NA,assistance' to 'this illegal Government in,20
NA,Air Force? Southern Rhodesia'.,20
Mr MCMAHON,I t has been made,20
NA,known to the House on many occasions,20
NA,in that the British Government has the pri-,20
NA,mary responsibility for relationships be-,20
NA,imtween itself and the illegal regime in,20
NA,Southern Rhodesia. There has been no,20
NA,change in this Government's policy. We,20
NA,to the United Nations resolution.,20
NA,in There are some exports within the resolu-,20
NA,"tion, such as wheat for humanitarian",20
NA,"reasons or medicines, books and similar",20
NA,WOOL things. We do not export to Southern,20
NA,PriRhodesia those items covered by the,20
NA,resolution. I can confirm what the,20
NA,actihonourable gentleman said I stated in,20
NA,"answer to a question asked of me, that that",20
NA,still remains the Government's policy.,20
NA,SNOWY MOUNTAINS ENGINEERING,21
NA,CORPORATION,21
Mr WHITTORN, I ask the Minister,21
NA,for National Development whether the,21
NA,newly formed Snowy Mountains Engineer-,21
NA,ing Corporation has been active in obtain-,21
NA,ing consultant work or construction con-,21
NA,tracts either within Australia or overseas?,21
NA,"Will the Minister outline the results, if",21
NA,"any, of these activities and confirm what",21
NA,success has resulted from the Govern-,21
NA,ment's decision to form the Corporation?,21
Mr SWARTZ,Th e Snowy Mountains,21
NA,Engineering Corporation has settled down,21
NA,very satisfactorily to carry out the policy,21
NA,which has been laid down by this Parlia-,21
NA,ment. It is pleasing to know that it has,21
NA,been able to obtain quite a number of con-,21
NA,"tracts, some of which are very substantial,",21
NA,particularly overseas. Under the terms of,21
NA,constitution the Corporation does this in,21
NA,many cases in conjunction with private,21
NA,"consultant firms. Recently, a very substan-",21
NA,tial contract was obtained by the Corpora-,21
NA,tion in South Korea. The Minister for,21
NA,Primary Industry happened to be in that,21
NA,country at the time and he assisted very,21
NA,substantially in the finalisation of the,21
NA,tract. The Government anticipates that,21
NA,more contracts will be obtained in the,21
NA,future because the standing of the Snowy,21
NA,"Mountains Hydro-electric Authority, now",21
NA,the Snowy Mountains Engineering Cor-,21
NA,"poration, is very high throughout the",21
NA,world. Many inquiries have been received.,21
NA,Many openings are being followed by the,21
NA,Corporation at the present time. I antici-,21
NA,"pate that, in addition to the hundreds of",21
NA,contracts which the Corporation is assisting,21
NA,"in Australia, it will win an increasing",21
NA,number of substantial contracts overseas in,21
NA,the future.,21
NA,SERVICE PAY RATES,21
Mr KEITH JOHNSON , I ask a quesMinister,21
NA,tion of the Minister for the Army. Does should provide.,21
NA,the Minister know of any reason why,21
NA,tradesmen at the Army Design Establish-,21
NA,ment in Melbourne have not yet received,21
NA,the recent 6 per cent increase announced,21
NA,by the Commonwealth Conciliation and,21
NA,Arbitration Commission late last year? Is,21
NA,aware that all other employees at the,21
NA,establishment have received the increase?,21
NA,Will he take steps to expedite the,21
NA,ment? Will he ensure that future decisions,21
NA,are implemented closer to the date,21
NA,announcement than has been the practice,21
NA,for many years?,21
Mr GORTON,I f the honourable mem-,21
NA,"ber will permit, I will answer this question",21
NA,because pay rates apply not to one Service,21
NA,but to all Services. The reason why the 6,21
NA,per cent increase awarded by the Com-,21
NA,monwealth Conciliation and Arbitration,21
NA,Commission has not yet passed to uni-,21
NA,formed members of the Services is because,21
NA,it is necessary under the law for regula-,21
NA,tions to be made increasing the amounts,21
NA,paid. This is the duty of the Service con-,21
NA,"cerned and, in the case of the Army, I am",21
NA,informed that there were no fewer than 35,21
NA,pages of regulations required in order to,21
NA,make those and other amendments which,21
NA,were necessary as a result of various,21
NA,changes in pay rates. The law requires that,21
NA,its these regulations should then go through,21
NA,the Executive Council and should,21
NA,then,21
NA,Mr Keith Johnson-Thes e are civil-,21
NA,ians,21
Mr GORTON,Woul d you mind letting,21
NA,me finish? They are then laid on the table,21
NA,"conof each House. The regulations are, as I",21
NA,"understand, in draft form and they are",21
NA,expected to go before the Executive Coun-,21
NA,cil at its next meeting. The honourable,21
NA,member was interjecting when I was,21
NA,speaking as to the 6 per cent increase to,21
NA,uniformed personnel. Were you talking not,21
NA,of uniformed personnel?,21
NA,Mr Keith Johnson-No . I was speaking,21
NA,of civilians. I mentioned the word 'trades-,21
NA,"men', Mr Speaker. These are people who",21
NA,are employed by the Army Design Estab-,21
NA,"lishment, and are not uniformed personnel",21
NA,at all.,21
Mr GORTON,"I n that case, it would",21
NA,need to be a different answer which per-,21
NA,haps the Minister for the Army or the,21
NA,for Labour and National Service,21
NA,HYGIENE STANDARDS,21
Mr ROBINSON,Ha s the Minister for,21
NA,Trade and Industry seen a statement,21
NA,attributed to the honourable member for,21
NA,"he Riverina that foodstuffs, including cheese",21
NA,"and canned meat, of unknown and doubt-",21
NA,ful hygienic standard are flooding into,21
NA,"payAustralia, and further that increasing",21
NA,quantities of canned meat from areas,21
NA,of affected by foot and mouth disease are,21
NA,appearing in supermarkets? I ask the,22
NA,Minister: Is this statement a gross reflec-,22
NA,tion upon Australia's trade arrangements,22
NA,and stringent quarantine control measures?,22
NA,"Mr Stewart- Mr Speaker, I rise on a",22
NA,point of order. I draw your attention to,22
NA,standing order 144 which states in part:,22
NA,Questions should not contain-,22
NA,(a) statements of facts or names of persons,22
NA,unless they are strictly necessary to render,22
NA,the question intelligible and can be authen-,22
NA,ticated;,22
NA,I would ask you to ask the honourable,22
NA,member to authenticate his statement.,22
Mr SPEAKER, I think that the ques-,22
NA,tion asked by the honourable member for,22
NA,Cowper shows no disrespect or disregard,22
NA,for the honourable member for Riverina.,22
NA,The honourable member for Cowper is,22
NA,referring to a statement. Can he vouch for,22
NA,the accuracy of that statement?,22
NA,"Mr Robinson-Yes , Mr Speaker.",22
Mr ANTHONY, I did see in a paper a,22
NA,report of a speech made by the honourable,22
NA,"member for Riverina at, I think, the Uni-",22
NA,versity of Sydney or the University of New,22
NA,South Wales. I doubt whether the depart-,22
NA,ments concerned-th e Department of,22
NA,Health or the Department of Customs and,22
NA,Excise-woul d think that this was a reflec-,22
NA,"tion on them because, really, this gentle-",22
NA,man makes so many statements on so,22
NA,many things that they just take that state-,22
NA,ment for granted.,22
NA,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,22
Mr GRASSBY ,"Riverina)- Mr Speaker,",22
NA,I wish to make a personal explanation.,22
Mr SPEAKER,Doe s the honourable,22
NA,member claim to have been misrepre-,22
NA,sented?,22
Mr GRASSBY,Yes . I claim to have,22
NA,been misrepresented on 2 counts. In phras-,22
NA,ing his question to the Minister for Trade,22
NA,and Industry the honourable member for,22
NA,Cowper indicated that I had made criti-,22
NA,cisms of trading and quarantine arrange-,22
NA,ments in relation to an undefined matter,22
NA,which I could not quite identify by the,22
NA,honourable member's question. In answer,22
NA,to this question the Minister for Trade and,22
NA,Industry was inaccurate in the only thing,22
NA,he said. The Minister mixed up his univer-,22
NA,sities. I made some comments at the Uni-,22
NA,versity of New England. I would commend,22
NA,the Minister to study what is happening,22
NA,and perhaps to ask me in future before,22
NA,speculating about something which I was,22
NA,reported to have said.,22

NA,Ministerial Statement,22
Mr MCMAHON ,Lowe-Prim e Minis-,22
NA,ter)-b y leave-O n 7th April 1970 the,22
NA,Government announced to the House the,22
NA,membership of a joint committee estab-,22
NA,lished by the Commonwealth and Queens-,22
NA,land to investigate the problem of the,22
NA,Crown of Thorns Starfish on the Great,22
NA,Barrier Reef. The committee comprised:,22
NA,Commonwealth Nominees,22
NA,"Professor R. J. Walsh, O.B.E., Professor",22
NA,of Human Genetics at the University of,22
NA,New South Wales (Chairman).,22
NA,"Professor W. G. H. Maxwell, Associate",22
NA,Professor of Geology at the University of,22
NA,Sydney.,22
NA,"Mr D. J. Tranter, Senior Research Sci-",22
NA,"entist, Division of Fisheries and Oceanog-",22
NA,"raphy, Commonwealth Scientific and",22
NA,Industrial Research Organisation.,22
NA,Queensland Nominees,22
NA,"Dr J. M. Harvey, Director-General ot",22
NA,Primary Industries.,22
NA,"Professor J. M. Thomson, Professor of",22
NA,Zoology at the Queensland University.,22
NA,"Mr C. L. Harris, of the Department of",22
NA,Primary Industries.,22
NA,The anouncement of the committee's,22
NA,membership followed agreement reached,22
NA,on 29th January 1970 by both Govern-,22
NA,ments that such a committee be established,22
NA,and that it should be financed on a dollar,22
NA,for dollar basis by each Government.,22
NA,I am pleased to be able to tel] the,22
NA,"House that on last Thursday, 25th March,",22
NA,"the Chairman of the Committee, Professor",22
NA,"Walsh, reported to me on the results of",22
NA,the committee's work. In view of the,23
NA,importance of the report and of the wide-,23
NA,spread interest which has been taken in its,23
NA,progress I arranged for Cabinet to consider,23
NA,the report today and for the report to be,23
NA,tabled so that honourable members will be,23
NA,able to inform themselves fully of its con-,23
NA,"clusions, and of the reasons underlying",23
NA,these conclusions. Honourable members,23
NA,will be aware of the very deep concern,23
NA,which is felt by many about the possibility,23
NA,of destruction to the Great Barrier Reef by,23
NA,the crown of thorns starfish. This concern,23
NA,has been deepened for many by the belief,23
NA,that perhaps complete destruction of the,23
NA,Reef was inevitable unless early Govern-,23
NA,ment action was taken. Some have sug-,23
NA,gested that it may now be too late to save,23
NA,the Reef. It is therefore pertinent to draw,23
NA,to honourable members' attention a refer-,23
NA,ence in the Committee's report to articles,23
NA,in the Press and in semi-technical journals,23
NA,on the starfish as being either repetitive,23
NA,presentation of eye-catching speculations or,23
NA,exaggerations of .the limited facts available.,23
NA,Some of the confusion appears to have,23
NA,occurred because the available methods of,23
NA,estimating population densities of the,23
NA,starfish are rather crude. Extrapolations,23
NA,from these results are not reliable and are,23
NA,of doubtful value. Also overlooked has,23
NA,been the fact that the publishedfiguresof,23
NA,the proportion of dead coral on reefs,23
NA,attacked by the starfish have included an,23
NA,estimated 10 to 50 per cent of corals killed,23
NA,by other means-suc h deaths being a nor-,23
NA,mal state of affairs. Analogies have been,23
NA,drawn between the action which had been,23
NA,taken on Guam and the situation in the,23
NA,"Great Barrier Reef. On Guam, teams of",23
NA,divers were used to combat the starfish.,23
NA,Some felt that a similar operation should,23
NA,be mounted on the Great Barrier Reef.,23
NA,Such suggestions overlooked the fact that,23
NA,Guam has a comparatively simple reef sur-,23
NA,"rounding it, around which the starfish were",23
NA,"said to move, limited on one side by the",23
NA,island beach and on the other by the sea,23
NA,"proper, whereas the Great Barrier Reef is",23
NA,of a size and a complexity which makes,23
NA,similar generalised action to that taken on,23
NA,Guam ineffective.,23
NA,In the light of the wide differences,23
NA,"authoritative opinion as to the threat,",23
NA,"any, which the starfish posed to the Great",23
NA,Barrier Reef the Commonwealth considered,23
NA,it necessary to obtain more facts before,23
NA,any further action was taken to deal,23
NA,with the starfish beyond that already,23
NA,set in train by the Queensland Government,23
NA,and to which reference is made in the,23
NA,committee's report. The Great Barrier,23
NA,Reef is perhaps the most complex eco-,23
NA,system known to man and many experts,23
NA,considered that it would have been irre-,23
NA,sponsible for generalised action to be taken,23
NA,before knowing the likely consequences of,23
NA,such action upon the chain of life which,23
NA,comprises the Reef as we know it. As to,23
NA,the results of the committee's investiga-,23
NA,"tions, the committee has found that:",23
NA,the crown of thorns starfish does not,23
NA,constitute a threat to the Great Barrier,23
NA,Reef as a whole;,23
NA,there is no danger of substantial erosion,23
NA,of the physical structure of the reef; and,23
NA,there is no threat to the Queensland,23
NA,coastline or ports.,23
NA,"The entire living cover, or even a large",23
NA,"proportion of the coral cover, of the Reef",23
NA,will not disappear as a result of the crown,23
NA,of thorns starfish. Whilst there has been,23
NA,extensive damage to coral because of the,23
NA,"starfish, serious damage is limited. Re-",23
NA,colonisation and regeneration of coral have,23
NA,occurred on all reefs examined by the,23
NA,committee. The committee has not been,23
NA,able to determine whether the high density,23
NA,of starfish in some areas is a unique or a,23
NA,cyclical phenomenon but it appears more,23
NA,likely to be an episodic event which may,23
NA,have occurred previously.,23
NA,The committee refers to the fact that,23
NA,the feeding by the crown of thorns on liv-,23
NA,"ing coral constitutes, in the long term, part",23
NA,"of the reef building process, whereby dead",23
NA,material is consolidated in order to provide,23
NA,the platform necessary for ihe Reef's con-,23
NA,tinued growth. Tourist activity has not,23
NA,declined as a result of the starfish damage.,23
NA,The committee cannot give the reason for,23
NA,the population increase of crown of thorns,23
NA,starfish in some areas. It reports that the,23
NA,hypothesis that local collection of triton,23
NA,shells has reduced predator pressure on the,23
NA,starfish has not been substantiated nor has,23
NA,the hypothesis that pesticides and other,23
NA,organic chemicals may have been causal.,23
NA,of The committee believes that there is no,23
NA,if need to attempt to reduce Ihe population,23
NA,of the crown of thorns starfish throughout,23
NA,the whole of the Great Barrier Reef at the,23
NA,present time. It does not dispute that cer-,24
NA,tain reefs or portion of reefs having social,24
NA,or commercial importance may be pro-,24
NA,tected by manual destruction of accessible,24
NA,starfish.,24
NA,The committee finds that present,24
NA,ledge of reef ecology is inadequate to,24
NA,assess fully present and future problems,24
NA,concerning the crown of thorns starfish,24
NA,and related matters. It therefore suggests,24
NA,programme of research involving continued,24
NA,monitoring of starfish population; research,24
NA,"into reef ecology, with particular attention",24
NA,to the biology of the starfish and corals;,24
NA,and experiments in local control of,24
NA,starfish. To achieve this programme it,24
NA,recommends that a sum of money of the,24
NA,"order of $90,000 to $120,000 be provided",24
NA,in the first year to allow such research,24
NA,that the sum provided be increased proplay,24
NA,gressively in each of the second and third,24
NA,years at which time there would be a,24
NA,review in the light of the operation of,24
NA,Australian Institute of Marine Science.,24
NA,"I have already mentioned, Cabinet has",24
NA,considered the recommendations of the,24
NA,committee. I am pleased to be able to say,24
NA,that the Government agrees with the recthis,24
NA,ommendations of the committee. I have,24
NA,been in touch with the Queensland Premier,24
NA,"and we have agreed that $45,000 be the",24
NA,allocated on a matching basis by each,24
NA,Government for research projects recomquate,24
NA,mended in its first year by an advisory,24
NA,committee. The advisory committee would,24
NA,report to the Minister for Education and,24
NA,"Science, who will act on behalf",24
NA,Governments. This amount will be,24
NA,"increased by $10,000 by each Government",24
NA,in each of the second and third years.,24
NA,Each Government is prepared to increase,24
NA,its grant on a matching basis to the upper,24
NA,limits recommended by the report if the,24
NA,advisory committee finds in practice that,24
NA,has sufficiently good research projects,24
NA,warrant this. I shall announce the memas,24
NA,bership of the advisory committee as,24
NA,as possible.,24
NA,I present the following paper: .,24
NA,Crown of Thorns Starfish-Ministeria l,24

NA,LEADER OF THE HOUSE,24
NA,Ministerial Statement,24
Mr SWARTZ ,Darling Downs-Ministe r,24
NA,for National Development)-b y leave-A s,24
NA,this is the first sitting day since my,24
NA,"knowappointment as Leader of the House, I",24
NA,wish to take the opportunity to indicate,24
NA,briefly my intention to work at all times,24
NA,towards the smooth and efficient operation,24
NA,a of the House. It will be my aim to estab-,24
NA,lish as quickly as possible a close co-opera-,24
NA,tive working arrangement with Mr,24
NA,"Speaker, The Clerks of the House, the",24
NA,"Government and Opposition Whips, and",24
NA,the the Leader and Deputy Leader of the,24
NA,Opposition. The efficient transaction of,24
NA,"Government, general and private members'",24
NA,business can result only from the utmost,24
NA,"and co-operation of all members, and I hope to",24
NA,my part in working with the Deputy,24
NA,Leader of the Opposition towards this end.,24
NA,The prestige and dignity of Parliament,24
NA,the are vital to the maintenance of a demo-,24
NA,"As cratic system of government, and at this",24
NA,early point of time I can assure the House,24
NA,that there will be no lack of. effort on my,24
NA,part to ensure that the high standing of,24
NA,House is maintained. It is my duty to,24
NA,ensure that the Government's legislative,24
NA,"programme proceeds' on schedule, but at",24
NA,same time there must be a full recognis-,24
NA,tion of the rights of all members to ade-,24
NA,debating time for general and private,24
NA,1,24
NA,members' business. I am sure that I can,24
NA,depend upon the support of all members,24
NA,of the House in the maintenance of these,24
NA,of ooth principles and practice.,24
Mr BARNARD ,Bass)-b y leave-Firs t,24
NA,"of all, on behalf of fhe Opposition, I",24
NA,"extend congratulations or commiserations,",24
NA,"whichever is in order, to the Minister for",24
NA,National Development ( Mr Swartz). I can,24
NA,assure the Minister for National Develop-,24
NA,"it ment that I will try tb work, as he sug-",24
NA,"to gests, in very close co-operation with him",24
NA,the Deputy Leader of the Opposition,24
NA,soon and the one on this side of the House,24
NA,having the responsibility for duties such as,24
NA,those for which the Minister has responsi-,24
NA,bilities on behalf of the Government. I,24
NA,hope that the same very close relationship,24
NA,Statewill exist between the Minister and me as,24
NA,"existed between me and his predecessor,",24
NA,"the present Treasurer ( Mr Snedden), with",24
NA,whom I worked for a very. long time and,24
NA,with whom I was very closely associated in,24
NA,conducting the business of the House. I,24
NA,agree that the conduct of the business of,24
NA,the House depends to a very large extent,25
NA,upon the degree of co-operation between,25
NA,the Leader of the House and the Deputy,25
NA,Leader of the Opposition.,25
NA,I certainly welcome the assurance that,25
NA,the Minister has given that he will give,25
NA,very close consideration to the matters,25
NA,raised by honourable members on this side,25
NA,and lhat all members will be given the,25
NA,fullest opportunity to debate the matters,25
NA,that come before the Parliament: Of,25
NA,"course, the Minister was referring particu-",25
NA,larly to private membeis and in this resp-,25
NA,ect one can assume that there will be full,25
NA,opportunity to debate all the matters that,25
NA,come before the House. I am now refer-,25
NA,ring more specifically to debates on Bills.,25
NA,hope that there will be no curtailment of,25
NA,members' activities in respect of debating,25
NA,legislation introduced by the Government.,25
NA,We assume that the new Leader of the,25
NA,House will not be moving the guillotine as,25
NA,"often as his predecessor did, and that if",25
NA,there arc members on this side of the,25
NA,House who wish to debate a Bill the,25
NA,Minister will always agree that the max-,25
NA,imum time should be allowed for debate.,25
NA,May 1 say also that we on this side of the,25
NA,House believe that debating time should,25
NA,not be curtailed and that it would be far,25
NA,better and that far greater advantage,25
NA,would accrue to all members if the length,25
NA,of sittings were extended instead of having,25
NA,members' activities curtailed as they are at,25
NA,"present. Finally, I again congratulate the",25
NA,Minister. I appreciate that he has made a,25
NA,very concise statement to the Parliament,25
NA,on the way in which he intends to conduct,25
NA,the business of the House on behalf of the,25
NA,Government. I am sure I can work with,25
NA,"him on the same basis, and, I hope, with",25
NA,the same degree of competence as I was,25
NA,"able to work with his predecessor, the pre-",25
NA,sent Treasurer.,25
Mr DALY ,Grayndler)-b y leave-,25
NA,wish to join in the welcome to the new,25
NA,Leader of the House ( Mr Swartz). I lisalmost,25
NA,tened with interest to the announcement,25
NA,his appointment. We on this side of the,25
NA,House are becoming almost dizzy from the,25
NA,changes in those appointed fo this imporremind,25
NA,"tant position on the other side of the Parsition,",25
NA,liament. We do not know from day to day,25
NA,how long the Minister announced by the,25
NA,Liberals to be in charge of the proceedings,25
NA,of this Parliament will remain in that,25
NA,position. Not long ago we had the former,25
NA,Minister for Air.,25
Mr SPEAKER,Order ! The matter,25
NA,under discussion is the statement just made,25
NA,"by the Leader of the House, the Minister",25
NA,for National Development. The honourable,25
NA,member is not allowed to go outside this,25
NA,subject matter to talk about other Minis-,25
NA,ters.,25
Mr DALY, I always admire the wis-,25
NA,"dom underlying your judgments, Mr",25
NA,"Speaker, and from long experience I know",25
NA,"that you bave the last say. Consequently, I",25
NA,have no wish to infringe today. I was,25
NA,making passing reference to the prede-,25
NA,cessors of the earnest new Leader of the,25
NA,House. I listened with interest to his state-,25
NA,I ment that he will work at all times towards,25
NA,the noble objectives which will govern his,25
NA,administration of this important position. I,25
NA,hope he succeeds in giving effect to that,25
NA,statement because expressions of that kind,25
NA,were made by many of the numerous,25
NA,Ministers who occupied this position in the,25
NA,past and generally the Opposition has,25
NA,never been treated more harshly than it,25
NA,has by the Leaders of the House who,25
NA,uttered those expressions.,25
NA,The Minister said he will uphold the,25
NA,prestige and dignity of the Parliament.,25
NA,"Fancy a Liberal member, aftei what has",25
NA,"gone on in recent weeks, telling the House",25
NA,that he will uphold the dignity of the Par-,25
NA,liament. The honourable member should,25
NA,first try to establish law and order in his,25
NA,own Party before trying to uphold the dig-,25
NA,nity of the Parliament. Then he said that,25
NA,the high standing of this House will be,25
NA,maintained. These are noble principles but,25
NA,what guarantee have we that he will do all,25
NA,these things? When all is said and done he,25
NA,"is only one of many, the voice of a Min-",25
NA,"istry elected on a spoils-to-the-victor basis,",25
NA,and if he does not obey the Prime Minister,25
NA,"( Mr MCMahon) in his every whim, irres-",25
NA,pective of the effects on our rights in this,25
NA,"I Parliament, honourable members know as",25
NA,well as I do that he will be replaced,25
NA,overnight. As he is congratulated,25
NA,of today by the Deputy Leader of the Oppo-,25
NA,sition ( Mr Barnard) on his appointment to,25
NA,"this position, we on this side of the House",25
NA,him that we are not just the Oppo-,25
NA,that we are not the minority party.,25
NA,We polled more votes at the last Federal,25
NA,election than the collection of nondescripts,25
NA,who govern the country from that side of,25
NA,"the House at this stage. Therefore, we are",25
NA,entitled not only to justice but also to the,25
NA,fairest possible treatment.,25
NA,There should not be any curtailment ot,26
NA,"debate, and I hope the Leader of thc",26
NA,House understands this. Every member is,26
NA,entitled to talk on every Bill if he so,26
NA,desires. With 12 months available in everv,26
NA,year there is no reason why the Leader of,26
NA,the House should guillotine or curtail,26
NA,debate at any time in the Parliament. The,26
NA,honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr,26
NA,"Turner), an outspoken advocate in this",26
NA,"Parliament of the rights of members, well",26
NA,knows that he has been harshly treated by,26
NA,former Leaders of the House. I hope he,26
NA,will add a few words to what 1 am saying.,26
NA,We expect fair treatment from the Minis-,26
NA,ter who is now responsible for the task of,26
NA,running the Parliament and we expect him,26
NA,to recognise the rights of an Opposition.,26
NA,"After all, it is not much satisfaction to",26
NA,members who have been sent here to rep-,26
NA,resent their constituencies to be gagged by,26
NA,a government which is afraid of criticism.,26
NA,"Therefore, fhe Minister who in days gone",26
NA,by has had a certain tolerance in the,26
NA,"administration of his Department, will be",26
NA,fully tested and'we will judge bim accord-,26
NA,ing to how he treats honourable members,26
NA,on this side of the House.,26
NA,I do not know what the Government has,26
NA,in mind for the future running of the,26
NA,House but already speeches have been cur-,26
NA,"tailed, debates have been curtailed and the",26
NA,gag has been used on numerous occasions.,26
NA,1 understand another Ministry is to be,26
NA,"created, to be known as the Department of",26
NA,the Vice-President of the Executive Coun-,26
NA,cil. The Minister's full responsibility prob-,26
NA,ably will be to move the gag in this House,26
NA,as that is generally the responsibility of the,26
NA,Minister holding that position. Perhaps the,26
NA,"Minister in reply will tell us, apart from",26
NA,"expressing his sentiments, precisely what he",26
NA,intends to do to improve on the adminis-,26
NA,tration of the previous Leader of the,26
NA,House. 1 hope he does not have the chequ-,26
NA,ered career in the Parliament that the new,26
NA,Treasurer has had. We thought he was a,26
NA,reasonably good leader of the House but,26
NA,"the Prime Minister did not, so out he",26
NA,went. The Government thought it had a,26
NA,better one and the next thing we knew the,26
NA,Treasurer bobbed up again like a jack-in-,26
NA,the-box. We do not know whether this will,26
NA,happen to the present incumbent now sit-,26
NA,ting at the table.,26
NA,I regret the restriction you have placed,26
NA,"on my address today, Mr Speaker, but I",26
NA,could not let the occasion pass without,26
NA,saying that we on this side of the House,26
NA,look forward to big things from the Minis-,26
NA,"ter, but with some trepidation, because the",26
NA,machine that grinds behind him and tells,26
NA,him precisely what he is to do in this Par-,26
NA,liament does not know much about noble,26
NA,"objectives, high principles and all those",26
NA,"things of which the Minister, spoke. Let us",26
NA,hope that the Minister gives to honourable,26
NA,members on this side of (he House and all,26
NA,members of the Parliament equitable treat-,26
NA,ment in respect of parliamentary business.,26
NA,"For instance, we would like to see the 11",26
NA,o'clock rule imposed again so that honour-,26
NA,able members would not need to debate in,26
NA,the dead of night. We. would like to sec,26
NA,the Minister keep the Parliament going,26
NA,instead of rushing into recess to hide the,26
NA,divisions in the ranks of those who sit,26
NA,behind him. We would like .to know that,26
NA,we can debate the nation's needs in this,26
NA,Parliament.,26
NA,1 suppose the Minister's appointment as,26
NA,Leader of the House is a matter for con-,26
NA,gratulations because anybody who has sur-,26
NA,vived the' last purge of the Liberal Party is,26
NA,entitled at least to some Credit. The Minis-,26
NA,ter is amongst those who have survived,26
NA,and his elevation is something that must,26
NA,have surprised even him. I urge the Minis-,26
NA,ter to give effect to the things he has enun-,26
NA,"ciated today. We look forward to justice,",26
NA,understanding and tolerance being,26
NA,extended to members on this side of the,26
NA,House. Whilst I say that! we look forward,26
NA,"to this, we are not too confident that we",26
NA,"will get it. In any case, this change indi-",26
NA,cates the turmoil that exists opposite. It,26
NA,indicates also that whilst . Liberal Party,26
NA,members will speak well of what they will,26
NA,"do in the Parliament, long, experience has",26
NA,taught us that their actions are totally,26
NA,different. I hope that the Minister retains,26
NA,his position and does not disappear in a,26
NA,"night as do some Ministers because, in a",26
NA,"funny kind of way, we like him. However,",26
NA,at the same time we are not too confident,26
NA,that he will be much better than those who,26
NA,have preceded him.,26

NA,TERRITORY,27
Mr DALY ,Grayndler)-O n behalf of,27
NA,the Joint Committee on the Australian,27
NA,Capital Territory I bring up the Commit-,27
NA,tee's report on proposals for variations of,27
NA,the plan of the layout of the city of,27
NA,Canberra in tbe Australian Capital Terri-,27
NA,tory as gazetted in 1925-th e forty-seventh,27
NA,series of variations. I ask leave to make a,27
NA,short statement in connection with the,27
NA,report.,27
Mr SPEAKER,Order ! There being no,27
NA,"objection, leave is granted.",27
Mr DALY," Mr Speaker, the report",27
NA,which 1 have just tabled is the first of its,27
NA,kind though the mailer with which it deals,27
NA,is one to which the Joint Committee on,27
NA,the Australian Capital Territory has given,27
NA,consideration ro on a number of previous,27
NA,"occasions, namely, proposed variations to",27
NA,the plan of layout of the city of Canberra.,27
NA,Honourable members will be aware that,27
NA,the resolution of appointment of the Joint,27
NA,Committee on the Australian Capital Terri-,27
NA,tory requires it to:,27
NA,examine and report on all proposals for modifica-,27
NA,tions or variations of the plan of lay-out of the,27
NA,City of Canberra and its environs published in the,27
NA,Commonwealth of Australia Gazette on the ninefor,27
NA,"teenth day of November 1925, as previously move:",27
NA,"modified or varied, which are referred to the",27
NA,committee by the Minister for the Interior.,27
NA,For a variety of reasons the Committee,27
NA,has not reported to Parliament before,27
NA,considers it proper to do so in the case,27
NA,"the current proposals, known as the fortyreason",27
NA,"seventh series of variations, and on all",27
NA,future occasions.,27
NA,It will be of interest to honourable,27
NA,members lo know that the proposals for,27
NA,variations are fully explained to the,27
NA,mittee in private session by officers of,27
NA,National Capital Development Commission,27
NA,and the Department of the Interior and,27
NA,following examination of these officers,27
NA,"inspection, where necessary, of the sites",27
NA,"proposed variations, the",27
NA,satisfies itself as to the desirability,27
NA,practicality of the variations befoie recom-,27
NA,mending their adoption. These matters are,27
NA,"not considered lightly, nor are members of",27
NA,the Committee easily satisfied of the worth,27
NA,of the proposals. Much evidence is taken,27
NA,and the National Capital Development,27
NA,Commission and the Department of the,27
NA,Interior go to considerable trouble to satis-,27
NA,fy the penetrating examination of the pro-,27
NA,posals made by the members of the Com-,27
NA,"Report mittee, in short, this is not a rubber stamp",27
NA,procedure. The House is assured that,27
NA,where proposed variations are recommend-,27
NA,"ed, they have been well considered.",27
NA,Honourable members will be aware that,27
NA,there is a requirement for the proposed,27
NA,variations to lie on the table in both the,27
NA,Senate and the House of Representatives,27
NA,for a minimum period of 6 sitting days,27
NA,and this procedure follows the consider-,27
NA,ation by members of the Committee. There,27
NA,"is, therefore, and there always has been,",27
NA,the opportunity for honourable members to,27
NA,satisfy themselves as to the merit of the,27
NA,proposals. The tabling of this report does,27
NA,not in any way affect the procedure,27
NA,referred to and the proposals will still lie,27
NA,on the table in the customary fashion at,27
NA,some point after this report has been,27
NA,tabled.,27

NA,AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL,27
NA,BILL 1970,27
NA,Discharge of Order of the Day,27
Mr SWARTZ ,Darling Downs-Ministe r,27
NA,National Development) (3.45)- I,27
NA,"That Government Business, Order of the Day",27
NA,"No. 1, Australian War Memorial Bill 1970. sec-",27
NA,"ond reading, be discharged.",27
NA,but In moving this motion 1 should like,27
NA,of to explain briefly to the House the,27
NA,behind it. Since the Bill as now,27
NA,drafted was introduced on 21st May last,27
NA,year the Government has been considering,27
NA,further amendments to it. I am advised by,27
NA,the Clerk that the proposed amendments,27
NA,Comwould fall outside the long title of the,27
NA,the present Bill so that the amendments could,27
NA,be incorporated only as a result of some,27
NA,"complicated procedures. In addition, the",27
NA,and honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr,27
NA,of Turner) has indicated to the Government,27
NA,Committee his interest in certain other proposals.,27
NA,and For these reasons the Government believes,27
NA,it preferable to withdraw the present Bill.,28
NA,In due course a redrafted Bill will be,28
NA,introduced by the Minister for the Interior,28
NA,( Mr Hunt).,28
Mr TURNER ,Bradfield) (3.46)-Ther e,28
NA,are 3 observations I should like to make in,28
NA,"connection with this matter. First, it is",28
NA,proposed to withdraw the present Bill and,28
NA,to substitute another Bill for it. I would,28
NA,hope that the Leader of the House ( Mr,28
NA,Swartz) may be able to give some assur-,28
NA,ance that the substituted Bill will be,28
NA,brought before the House within a reason-,28
NA,able time. By this I mean that 1 hope that,28
NA,it will not be squeezed into the last week,28
NA,"of the sittings, perhaps at a late hour of",28
NA,the night. The reason why I ask for such,28
NA,"an assurance is that, as I think most hon-",28
NA,ourable members know both from notices,28
NA,that have appeared in the Party rooms and,28
NA,from a notification in their mail if they,28
NA,"have had time to read it, Mr Frank",28
NA,"Channon, who represents a particular point",28
NA,of view in relation to the incorporation of,28
NA,a tomb in the Memorial to contain the,28
NA,"remains of an unknown Australian soldier,",28
NA,is to come to Parliament House next,28
NA,Thursday at 3.30 p.m. and in Committee,28
NA,Room No. 2 to give an explanation of his,28
NA,point of view which is supported by the,28
NA,Returned Services League. It would be,28
NA,"unfortunate if, when members' minds have",28
NA,"been freshly devoted to this matter, the",28
NA,Bill were to be postponed for such a time,28
NA,that they had forgotten what they had,28
NA,heard about the issue.,28
NA,The second matter that I wish to raise,28
NA,concerns an assurance from the Leader of,28
NA,the House that the long title of the Bill,28
NA,will be amended in such a way as to make,28
NA,possible the incorporation of an amend-,28
NA,ment dealing with the matter which Mr,28
NA,Channon will be discussing with members,28
NA,on Thursday. Standing order 227 states in,28
NA,part:,28
NA,Any amendment may be moved to any part of,28
NA,"tbe Bill, provided the same be within the title or",28
NA,relevant to the subject matter of the Bill.,28
NA,The long title of the Bill that is to be,28
NA,withdrawn is: 'To amend section 6 of the,28
NA,Australian War Memorial Act 1962-1966'.,28
NA,The standing order I have just quoted,28
NA,limits amendments to amendments to sec-,28
NA,tion 6. If when the substituted Bill is,28
NA,"brought forward the title is restrictive, for",28
NA,example to amend section 6 and some,28
NA,"other section of the Act, then amendments",28
NA,will be limited to those 2 sections and it,28
NA,may be that those 2 sections do not offer,28
NA,the opportunity to me to move an amend-,28
NA,ment in relation to Mr Channon's pro-,28
NA,posal. I therefore hope that when the sub-,28
NA,stituted Bill is produced in the House it,28
NA,"will have a wide long title-fo r example,",28
NA,simply to amend the Australian War,28
NA,Memorial Act 1962-1966. This will then,28
NA,allow for the kind of amendment that I,28
NA,think should be moved in order that the,28
NA,sense of the House may be tested on this,28
NA,matter which has too long waited for a,28
NA,decision.,28
NA,The third and last matter that I wish to,28
NA,raise is this: I should like to appeal to the,28
NA,"Leader of the House to decide for himself,",28
NA,"if he has the authority to do so, or to seek",28
NA,"the opinion of the Government upon this,",28
NA,that this is a matter- I refer to the tomb,28
NA,with which Mr Channon . is concerned-,28
NA,that should be the subject of a free vote.,28
NA,The question whether or not the tomb con-,28
NA,taining the remains of an unknown Aus-,28
NA,tralian serviceman should be incorporated,28
NA,in the War Memorial is in no sense a,28
NA,Party matter. It affects the people of Aus-,28
NA,tralia as represented by members in this,28
NA,Parliament and in no way can it be consid-,28
NA,ered a matter of Government policy. So I,28
NA,appeal to the Leader of - the House to,28
NA,:,28
NA,decide for himself or to bring to the con-,28
NA,sideration of the Government the question,28
NA,"of making this matter, when raised on an",28
NA,amendment to the Bill ' proposed to be,28
NA,"brought into the House, the subject of a",28

Mr SWARTZ ,Darling Downs-Ministe r,28
NA,for National Development)- I ask the,28
NA,indulgence.of the House to raise a point of,29
NA,procedure on this legislation. Before the,29
NA,debate is resumed on this Bill I would like,29
NA,to suggest that it may suit the convenience,29
NA,of the House to have a general debate cov-,29
NA,"ering this Bill, the Dried Fruits Levy Bill,",29
NA,"and the Dried Fruits Levy Collection Bill,",29
NA,as Ihey are related measures. Separate,29
NA,"questions may, of course, be put on each",29
NA,of the Bills at the conclusion of the,29
NA,"debate. I suggest, therefore, Mr Deputy",29
NA,"Speaker, that you permit the subject mat-",29
NA,ter of the 3 Bills to be discussed in this,29
NA,debate.,29
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Lucock),29
NA,"-Ther e being no objection, that course",29
NA,will be followed.,29
Dr PATTERSON ,Dawson) (3.53)-Th e,29
NA,Opposition supports in principle the 3 Bills,29
NA,before the House. In the Committee stages,29
NA,we shall move 2 amendments dealing,29
NA,specifically with penalties and in relation,29
NA,evidence secured by people authorised by,29
NA,writ to do so. The principal objective of,29
NA,the Dried Fruits Research Bill 1971 is to,29
NA,establish a joint Commonwealth-industry,29
NA,research scheme following the accepted,29
NA,and tried principles laid down by legisla-,29
NA,tion pertaining to other industries. Funds,29
NA,will be raised by means of a levy on dried,29
NA,"fruit, and in addition the Commonwealth",29
NA,"Government, following again the principles",29
NA,"adopted with respect to other industries,",29
NA,will match this contribution on a $1 for $1,29
NA,"basis. The second Bill, the Dried Fruits",29
NA,"Levy Bill, authorises the imposition of the",29
NA,levy relating to dried fruits. The amounts,29
NA,equivalent to levy collection will be,29
NA,credited to the Dried Fruits Research,29
NA,Trust Account and this Account will be,29
NA,the working arrangement whereby the,29
NA,moneys which are used for research pur-,29
NA,poses are debited. The second Bill will,29
NA,provide that the rate of levy must not,29
NA,"exceed $1 a ton of currants, sultanas and",29
NA,"raisins and $5 a ton of dried apricots,",29
NA,"pears, peaches, nectarines and prunes. As",29
NA,with other similar pieces of legislation the,29
NA,operative rates of levy to be imposed will,29
NA,be prescribed by regulation.,29
NA,As the Minister for Primary Industry,29
NA,( Mr Sinclair) pointed out in his second,29
NA,"reading speech, the levy will be imposed",29
NA,on a net sweat box weight of all dried,29
NA,fruits of these kinds delivered to packing,29
NA,houses after the commencement of the,29
NA,Act. The operative rate is the rate which,29
NA,will apply in the first instance. The opera-,29
NA,"tive rate in respect of currants, sultanas",29
NA,and raisins will be 50c a ton and in respect,29
NA,of dried tree fruits the operative rates of,29
NA,levy relating broadly' to' the prospective,29
NA,sale value of each kind of fruit will be,29
NA,"prescribed. As the Minister pointed out,",29
NA,!,29
NA,this will be done in consultation with the,29
NA,research committee.' The third Bill is sim-,29
NA,ply the machinery Bill which again is com-,29
NA,mon to all similar pieces of legislation in,29
NA,Connection with the collection of research,29
NA,funds. This Bill enables the Government to,29
NA,"provide the machinery"" necessary for the",29
NA,collection of the levy On dried fruits,29
NA,imposed by the Dried Frdits Levy Bill.,29
NA,"The principal objective, of this legisla-",29
NA,"tion, of course, is to. enable the industry,",29
NA,by a process of self-help backed by Com-,29
NA,"monwealth finance, to - undertake specific",29
NA,measures of research-directly or indirectly,29
NA,to concerned with the production and market-,29
NA,ing of dried fruits. It will relate specifically,29
NA,"to currants, sultanas .and raisins and the",29
NA,"deciduous tree fruits.; such as apricots,",29
NA,"pears, peaches, nectarines and prunes. I",29
NA,understand from reading the second read-,29
NA,ing speech of the Minister that although,29
NA,there are some small . pockets of dried,29
NA,"apple production in. Tasmania, at this stage",29
NA,this part of the Tasmanian apple industry,29
NA,will not be the. subject of research. I do,29
NA,not know the reason for that. I would,29
NA,have thought that it could easily have been,29
NA,included beoause although it is only a,29
NA,"minor industry as such, nevertheless the",29
NA,principles in the process of drying fruit,29
NA,could equally apply in some instances to,29
NA,apples. We will not . make an issue of this,29
NA,but I cannot see any - basic reason why,29
NA,dried apples should not be covered by this,29
NA,Bill even though they represent only a,29
NA,small proportion of the apple industry,29
NA,located in Tasmania. ',29
NA,There is no need for me to emphasise,29
NA,the great importance .ofdried fruits to,29
NA,"some regions of Australia, basically the",29
NA,area in close proximity to the Murray,29
NA,River. There are areas in Western Aus-,29
NA,tralia where dried fruits are also important,29
NA,but without question it is the Murray,29
NA,environment which is the principal produc-,29
NA,ing region in Australia and with which we,29
NA,are concerned here. Members who repre-,29
NA,sent such areas fully realise the great,29
NA,importance to the economies of those,29
NA,"regions of specific industries, in this case,",30
NA,the dried fruits industry.,30
NA,Honourable members who represent that,30
NA,Murray River electorates know full well,30
NA,great importance of regional development,30
NA,and the economic consequences if anything,30
NA,goes wrong with the financial health of,30
NA,specialised industry. I represent an elecWe,30
NA,torate wbich contains the biggest sugar,30
NA,growing area in Australia. The same,30
NA,nomic principles as regards regional develfruits,30
NA,opment apply there. It is of utmost imporof a fruit.,30
NA,tance that vve realise this because in recent,30
NA,years we have had under discussion the,30
NA,consequences of Britain's entry into the,30
NA,European Common Market. Although the,30
NA,"loss of markets, specifically in terms",30
NA,"fruit, sugar, soft wheat and similar",30
NA,ucts may not be in aggregate greatly,30
NA,mental to the economy of Australia-tha,30
NA,is relative to the total gross value of,30
NA,duction or even the gross value of our,30
NA,exports-t o a region any significant loss,30
NA,a market and any significant reduction,30
NA,income could not only affect primary,30
NA,"ducers but, through the multiplier theory,",30
NA,influence and affect greatly those who,30
NA,depend on the hard core or nucleus of,30
NA,primary production. We have seen pracresentatives,30
NA,tical examples of this in Australia quite,30
NA,clearly in the great wool industry because,30
NA,of recent droughts and falling prices.,30
NA,belies'e that the principle of regional,30
NA,opment is something we have to emphasise,30
NA,a lot more. Too often we look at primary,30
NA,industry in Australia as a whole and,30
NA,not concentrate sufficiently on regional,30
NA,development. That is one reason why,30
NA,Opposition will always support the GovCommittee,30
NA,ernment in any constructive plan to duction,30
NA,increase the economic health of a basic,30
NA,"Australian industry, be it primary or",30
NA,ondary industry.,30
NA,I think the 2 main avenues of research,30
NA,in dried fruits are processing and marketrepresents,30
NA,ing. The actual production of dried fruits,30
NA,is important but this is a separate matter.,30
NA,In this Bill the 2 areas of priority for,30
NA,"research funds would, I think, be the proof",30
NA,cessing and marketing of the product. This,30
NA,would involve economic research into the,30
NA,packaging and marketing of the finished,30
NA,product both in Australia and overseas. We,30
NA,must keep abreast of technological changes,30
NA,and one way to do this is to utilise,30
NA,"own scientists, agricultural economists",30
NA,marketing economists in their respective,30
NA,specialised fields. In the dried fruits indus-,30
NA,try technology is on the move and anyone,30
NA,who believes that we can sit still and hope,30
NA,markets will come to Australia is in for,30
NA,the a shock. We have to' produce a product,30
NA,which will sell in competition from other,30
NA,major exporting countries and we have to,30
NA,:,30
NA,a get out and find markets for our products.,30
NA,have had research in the dried fruits,30
NA,industry but it has been on an ad hoc,30
NA,ecoapproach and it has applied to specific,30
NA,rather than to the different varieties,30
NA,The Research Committee will follow the,30
NA,usual pattern of other' research organisa-,30
NA,tions. From memory I think there are,30
NA,of approximately 9 industries which have vol-,30
NA,"produntarily agreed to contribute finance,",30
NA,detribacked by Commonwealth contributions.,30
NA,"t The Dried Fruits Research,Committee will",30
NA,probroadly follow the same basis of other,30
NA,research committees in that the industry,30
NA,of itself will have the dominant voice on the,30
NA,in Committee as to the allocation of funds,30
NA,proand the evaluation and the determination,30
NA,of priorities. The Research Committee will,30
NA,comprise 4 representatives of the Aus-,30
NA,"tralian Dried Fruits Association, 2 rep-",30
NA,"of packers of dried fruits, 3",30
NA,representatives of the Australian Agricul-,30
NA,"tural Council, one Representative of the",30
NA,I Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial,30
NA,develResearch Organisation and one represen-,30
NA,"tative of the Department, of Primary",30
NA,"Industry. This will be, a, well balanced",30
NA,do Committee with men of practical experi-,30
NA,ence of the problems .relating to specific,30
NA,the areas and industries. The men on this,30
NA,will be experienced in the pro-,30
NA,"and marketing of dried fruits, both",30
NA,domestically and overseas. The Committee,30
NA,secwill also have the assistance of funda-,30
NA,mental and applied scientists. Taken by,30
NA,and large I believe that the Committee,30
NA,another excellent step forward,30
NA,in tbe formulation of research projects for,30
NA,the benefit of the dried fruits industry and,30
NA,for the benefit of the nation. One function,30
NA,"the Committee will be ,to receive appli-",30
NA,cations from various institutions such as,30
NA,universities in Australia and from people,30
NA,concerned with production or with,30
NA,"scientific research into dried fruits, includ-",30
NA,"ing fundamental, applied or technical",30
NA,our research. The Committee will decide,30
NA,and whether to allocate funds to the research,30
NA,proposals submitted to it. The research will,30
NA,be administered and supervised by compe-,31
NA,tent authorities. At the same time the,31
NA,Committee will be highly conscious of the,31
NA,principles underlining priorities.,31
NA,I want to say something about research,31
NA,because it is something about which I feel,31
NA,"very strongly, and I am not the only one",31
NA,in industry or in research fields who feels,31
NA,this way. We are inclined to look at a lot,31
NA,of research in isolation when we do not,31
NA,have the machinery with which to examine,31
NA,at length whether there is any overlapping,31
NA,of research. We are also inclined to take,31
NA,for granted that because a first class scienare,31
NA,tist is doing the research such research,31
NA,"must be good, and this applies particularly",31
NA,in the field of fundamental research. 1 do,31
NA,not question in any way the value of,31
NA,research. What I am saying is that 1,31
NA,believe that today we have to think more,31
NA,"of priorities, particularly economic",31
NA,research and we should give it a greater,31
NA,weighting than perhaps even fundamental,31
NA,research. I do not in any way decry the,31
NA,work of the fundamental research scientist.,31
NA,We need these people. But world markets,31
NA,are changing so quickly and the profitabi-,31
NA,"lity in the dried fruits market, which is",31
NA,"small, is also changing, so that we have to",31
NA,have greater emphasis placed on economic,31
NA,and marketing research.,31
NA,I do not want my remarks to be conpast,31
NA,strued in any way that I am criticising,31
NA,work of the fundamental scientist. I was,31
NA,associated with research organisations prior,31
NA,to entering into politics. What I am trying,31
NA,to say is that I know that very often,31
NA,fundamental scientist is treated as some,31
NA,"sort of a god, that what he says goes",31
NA,if you question or evaluate the benefits,31
NA,"his work he will say T do not know, but",31
NA,may be able to tell you in one year or,31
NA,years time'. This is fundamental research,31
NA,and there is nothing wrong with it. We,31
NA,need replicated research. I may criticise,31
NA,any overlapping of fundamental research,31
NA,but by the same token the more people,31
NA,have doing the research the greater,31
NA,chance we have of achieving a constructive,31
NA,and substantive conclusion. The point,31
NA,want to make is that I believe this,31
NA,Research Committee will have to detercern,31
NA,mine priorities and this is one reason why,31
NA,the industry should have the dominant say,31
NA,in determining research proposals rather,31
NA,than perhaps the scientists.,31
NA,I urge the Government to give consider-,31
NA,ation to the evaluation of research. I am,31
NA,not one of the those people who treat,31
NA,research as a magic word. As one who has,31
NA,been trained in the field of research 1 am,31
NA,fully conscious of its deficiencies. I am,31
NA,conscious of the fact that any Government,31
NA,that is spending huge amounts of Federal,31
NA,money on research carried out by the,31
NA,CSIRO or by universities should ensure,31
NA,that there is some accounting of that,31
NA,research to the Parliament. Where indus-,31
NA,tries are involved there should also be,31
NA,some accounting to those industries. There,31
NA,plenty of scientists who would like to,31
NA,build a research empire; given the chance,31
NA,they would and good luck to them if they,31
NA,can get away with it.. One can always,31
NA,argue that all research is good. Perhaps it,31
NA,"is, provided it is constructive and adds to",31
NA,"knowledge. However, research has to be",31
NA,subject to evaluation and I believe it has to,31
NA,be subject to scrutiny. It should be,31
NA,accountable to the Parliament from time to,31
NA,time and particularly to the industry,31
NA,involved. which is supplying half of the,31
NA,funds. I make that plea in regard to the,31
NA,evaluation of research.,31
NA,"As I have said, I ""feel' very strongly",31
NA,about this. Perhaps one of these days when,31
NA,we get a chance we will be able to debate,31
NA,some of the avenues of research over the,31
NA,20 years. If we evaluated this research,31
NA,the we might have second thoughts about,31
NA,spending hundreds of thousands of dollars,31
NA,in a particular field of research. I repeat,31
NA,that this is not to decry in any way the,31
NA,the role of fundamental or applied research.,31
NA,"We have to have both;, we have to have",31
NA,"and extension, but at the same time we must",31
NA,of have the machinery for evaluation. I hope,31
NA,I that in the debate on this Bill the Minister,31
NA,10 will give honourable members some idea,31
NA,of what is to happen to the stability of the,31
NA,dried vine fruits industry. This industry is,31
NA,vitally affected by this .legislation.,31
NA,Honourable members will recall that on,31
NA,we 10th September 1969 the then Minister for,31
NA,"the Primary Industry, now the Minister for",31
NA,Trade and Industry ( Mr Anthony) made a,31
NA,I statement in which he said that the Gov-,31
NA,ernment was considering' with some con-,31
NA,the question Of the stability of the,31
NA,dried vine fruits industry and that it had,31
NA,agreed in principle to consider the possibil-,31
NA,ity of implementing a further stabilisation,31
NA,"scheme, which would be an extension of",31
NA,the 1964-68 dried vine fruits stabilisation,32
NA,"scheme. The Minister, after considerable",32
NA,discussion with the Australian Dried Fruits,32
NA,"Association, had arrived at a stabilisation",32
NA,"plan for currants, sultanas and raisins. This",32
NA,generated considerable speculation and,32
NA,controversy throughout the industry. In,32
NA,"fact, a major split developed in the indus-",32
NA,"try, which is something that an industry",32
NA,should attempt to avoid. The people in the,32
NA,dried vine fruits industry were for and,32
NA,against the plan. Some wanted a statutory,32
NA,authority and others wanted a stabilisation,32
NA,scheme.,32
NA,Uuder such circumstances a referendum,32
NA,was held to decide whether a stabilisation,32
NA,scheme would he acceptable to a majority,32
NA,of growers. The closing date of the poll,32
NA,was 23rd March 1970. Then the Minister,32
NA,made a statement to the effect that the,32
NA,proposal had been rejected by the eligible,32
NA,growers on the criteria laid down by the,32
NA,Government. Although 65 per cent of,32
NA,growers voted in favour of the proposal,32
NA,"and 35 per cent voted against it, the fact",32
NA,was that only two-thirds of all eligible,32
NA,"growers voted, so only 42 per cent of eligi-",32
NA,ble growers voted in favour of the scheme.,32
NA,It is important to consider this factor,32
NA,because no matter whether we establish a,32
NA,statutory authority or introduce a stabilisa-,32
NA,"tion scheme, as we know it, we must have",32
NA,"a stable industry, and the research which is",32
NA,to be undertaken as a result of this Bill,32
NA,must and should be applied to a stable,32
NA,industry.,32
NA,The question that I ask the Minister,32
NA,What is happening to the stability of the,32
NA,dried vine fruits industry? At the present,32
NA,time we are receiving disturbing reports,32
NA,about the increasing production of the dual,32
NA,"variety of grapes, that is, grapes which can",32
NA,be used for drying and for fresh consumpmajor,32
NA,"tion. Of course, once the bearing acreage",32
NA,increased the industry can be confronted,32
NA,with the problem of oversupply. From,32
NA,time to time in this Parliament I have,32
NA,argued strongly that all phases of primary,32
NA,industry have to be reorganised and that,32
NA,we have to refrain from adopting this ad,32
NA,"hoc, uncoordinated approach to primary",32
NA,"industry. We have, to reorganise primary",32
NA,industry in relation to realistic markets;,32
NA,"not airy-fairy markets which,",32
NA,"sised, might eventuate, but realistic mar-",32
NA,kets which exist at the present time and,32
NA,which wiil exist in the immediate future.,32
NA,We have to tailor our production in basic,32
NA,demand to fit the realistic markets. It is,32
NA,important to consider this factor because,32
NA,the dried fruit industry is unlike the wheat,32
NA,"industry which produces a cash crop, and",32
NA,production can be increased or decreased,32
NA,very quickly. Once vines and trees are,32
NA,established there are virtually fixed produc-,32
NA,tion levels and the only way in which,32
NA,production can be reduced is to chop,32
NA,down the vines or trees or for the vines or,32
NA,"trees to be subjected to weather conditions,",32
NA,such as frost. I ask that question so that,32
NA,the Minister might be able to give honour-,32
NA,able members and the industry some indi-,32
NA,cation of what the Government is thinking,32
NA,at the present lime.,32
NA,That is all I have to say on this,32
NA,measure. The Opposition supports the leg-,32
NA,"islation, as it has done with other research",32
NA,Bills which have come before the Parlia-,32
NA,"ment. However, at the Committee stage we",32
NA,will move 2 amendments dealing with the,32
NA,questions of penalties and the collection of,32
NA,evidence by those people authorised under,32
NA,the legislation.,32
NA,Debate (on motion by Mr Turnbull),32

NA,FUTURE OF AUSTRALIAN FORCES,32
NA,IN VIETNA M,32
NA,Ministerial Statement,32
Mr MCMAHON ,Lowe-Prim e Minis-,32
NA,"ter)-b y leave- Mr Speaker, the Govern-",32
NA,ment has been reviewing the position of,32
NA,Australia's military forces in Vietnam in,32
NA,is: order to determine what further with-,32
NA,"drawal options are open to it, having",32
NA,regard to the security situation and the,32
NA,intentions of the Government of the,32
NA,Republic of Vietnam and of our other,32
NA,allies. This review follows from the,32
NA,"is policy stated by the then Prime Minister,",32
NA,now the Minister for Defence ( Mr Gor-,32
NA,"ton), in April 1970 when, in announcing",32
NA,"the withdrawal of one Army battalion, he",32
NA,said that 'Should the progress of pacifica-,32
NA,tion and Vietnamisation succeed as the,32
NA,President (of the United States) hopes and,32
NA,"believes that it will, then at some stage",32
NA,during the 12 months period we will con-,32
NA,sider phasing additional troops into the,32
NA,it is hypotheplanned withdrawal'.,32
NA,"During his recent visit to Vietnam, the",32
NA,Minister for Defence had valuable discus-,32
NA,sions with Vietnamese leaders and with the,32
NA,Commander of United States forces in,33
NA,Vietnam. These consultations,33
NA,confirmed our assessment that steady,33
NA,improvement is being achieved in the secu-,33
NA,rity situation. Many factors have contri-,33
NA,buted to this improvement. The policy of,33
NA,"Vietnamisation, that is, the development of",33
NA,the capability and effectiveness of South,33
NA,"Vietnam's armed forces, has produced a",33
NA,much stronger and more cohesive fighting,33
NA,force. The pacification programme has also,33
NA,"achieved notable successes, and its contri-",33
NA,bution towards improved security in the,33
NA,rural areas has necessitated the enemy con-,33
NA,centrating his effort against that pro-,33
NA,"gramme. These developments, in combina-",33
NA,tion with North Vietnam's manpower,33
NA,"problems, have seen a significant decline in",33
NA,enemy-initiated activity over the last 2,33
NA,years.,33
NA,An important consequence of these,33
NA,achievements has been that the South Viet-,33
NA,namese have been able to continue their,33
NA,operations in Cambodia against North,33
NA,Vietnamese regular forces. Additionally,33
NA,they were able to initiate and conduct the,33
NA,recent operations against the North Viet-,33
NA,namese supply lines in southern Laos. The,33
NA,effect of these operations so far has been,33
NA,to prevent the enemy mounting large-scale,33
NA,actions inside South Vietnam and thus they,33
NA,have given the South Vietnamese time for,33
NA,the further development of their forces,33
NA,and for strengthening the pacification pro-,33
NA,gramme. In a number of key areas within,33
NA,South Vietnam the North Vietnamese have,33
NA,for the present lost the military initiative.,33
NA,The enemy forces are thus being forced to,33
NA,a position of reacting to the South Viet-,33
NA,namese rather than being able to fight at a,33
NA,time and place of their own choosing.,33
NA,Turning to the overall security of South,33
NA,"Vietnam, it is undeniable that there has",33
NA,been satisfactory progress towards the,33
NA,objective of establishing the circumstances,33
NA,in which South Vietnam can determine its,33
NA,"own future. There remain, of course,",33
NA,difficulties which should not be minimised.,33
NA,The North Vietnamese at the Paris talks,33
NA,have remained intransigent. Nothing con-,33
NA,structive has been offered by them towards,33
NA,a negotiated settlement. In Vietnam itself,33
NA,there has been some resurgence in Com-,33
NA,"munist terrorism, political agitation, and",33
NA,attacks against lines of communication.,33
NA,"These tactics by the Communists, using",33
NA,their remaining infrastructure in the,33
NA,"country, will doubtless be employed",33
NA,have against the Government and people for,33
NA,some time to come.,33
NA,ln its weighing up of the overall situa-,33
NA,"tion, the Government has. decided that fur-",33
NA,ther reductions of the Australian forces in,33
NA,Vietnam are feasible and desirable. With,33
NA,the agreement of the Government of the,33
NA,"Republic of Vietnam, and following con-",33
NA,sultations with United States military auth-,33
NA,"orities in Saigon, some forces will now be",33
NA,withdrawn. These are:,33
NA,Selected - combat and -supporting forces,33
NA,"of the Army task force,- including the",33
NA,"tank squadron, totalling about 650",33
NA,men; . .. >,33
NA,"Royal Australian Navy., personnel, about",33
NA,"45 in number, serving with the United",33

NA,No. 2 Canberra . Bomber Squadron,33
NA,involving 280 men; - ;,33
NA,Some aircraft of the;Caribou transport,33
NA,squadron and about 44 men.,33
NA,The reductions are therefore to be,33
NA,spread over the 3 Services and will have,33

NA,the Opposition)-b y leave-Th e new,34
NA,"Prime Minister ( Mr MCMahon), is the last",34
NA,of Australia's leading guilty men of Viet-,34
NA,nam. With the Postmaster-General ( Sir,34
NA,"Alan Hulme), he alone survives of the",34
NA,Menzies Government which committed,34
NA,"Australia to this disastrous, divisive war.",34
NA,He was one of the architects; he remains,34
NA,chief apologist. He and Sir Keith Holyoake,34
NA,are the only heads of government who,34
NA,have participated at every stage in the,34
NA,escalation of the war. But Sir Keith,34
NA,Holyoake at least has the grace to stop,34
NA,tifying it.,34
NA,"The commitment itself, ill-conceived as",34
NA,"it was, has not been the worst aspect of",34
NA,the Australian Government's baleful role,34
NA,"in this vast, interminable tragedy. At every",34
NA,stage in this war the Australian Govern-,34
NA,"ment-th e Menzies Government, the Holt",34
NA,"Government, the Gorton Government-ha s",34
NA,used whatever influence it had to enlarge,34
NA,and lo prolong the war. No government or,34
NA,administration has been so consistent or,34
NA,more malign. Even the Johnson Adminis-,34
NA,tration stopped the bombing of North,34
NA,Vietnam. This Government was supporting,34
NA,such bombing to the bitter end. The John-,34
NA,son Administration started negotiations and,34
NA,included the National Liberation Front in,34
NA,those negotiations. Four successive Aus-,34
NA,tralian Prime Ministers denounced the very,34
NA,concept of negotiations.,34
NA,The present Prime Minister was the,34
NA,most trenchant in his denunciations. It was,34
NA,coun- left to the present Prime Minister in,34
NA,November 1967 to denounce as treason,34
NA,proposals which were accepted in part by,34
NA,the United States in March 1968 and in,34
NA,whole by November 1968. Of all these,34
NA,Prime Ministers he has been the hottest in,34
NA,his optimism and the coldest in his percep-,34
NA,tion of what this war has meant in human,34
NA,terms-i n terms of scorched earth and,34
NA,"scorched bodies, in terms of the devas-",34
NA,"tation of the whole of Indo-China, in terms",34
NA,of the destruction of one of the proudest,34
NA,civilisations in the region and in terms of,34
NA,the degradation of an entire generation of,34
NA,the Vietnamese people. One can go,34
NA,through all his speeches-h e has made,34
NA,many on this subject-ye t not find one,34
NA,"word to indicate the slightest conception,",34
NA,compassion or compunction about what we,34
NA,are doing to a whole race of human,34
NA,"beings. On the contrary, to him such ques-",34
NA,tioning and such doubts were treason. He,34
NA,"remains unrepentant, defiant to the last. In",34
NA,November 1967 he was predicting victory,34
NA,"just around the corner. In March 1968,",34
NA,"just after the Tet offensive, he was one of",34
NA,those who claimed that this had been a,34
NA,great setback to the Vietcong because they,34
NA,its had over-extended and exhausted them-,34
NA,selves. As Minister for Foreign Affairs he,34
NA,endorsed the inruption into Cambodia. As,34
NA,Prime Minister a fortnight ago he was,34
NA,claiming victory in Laos. His reaction to,34
NA,"justhese events shows that, even after a dec-",34
NA,"ade of blood and blunders, he and his gov-",34
NA,ernment are incapable of learning the les-,34
NA,son of Vietnam and are wilfully blind to,34
NA,the nature of this war. They still see this,35
NA,struggle solely in military terms. They still,35
NA,seek the mirage of military victory.,35
NA,The Prime Minister has made a state-,35
NA,ment which continues the tradition of,35
NA,deceit which has characterised this war.,35
NA,continues the charade that the disposition,35
NA,of our forces is related to the military,35
NA,ation in the Province of Phuoc Tuy. This,35
NA,"was a war conceived in deceit, nurtured in",35
NA,deceit and it is ending in deceit. It is an,35
NA,appalling thing-appallin g for demo-,35
NA,cracy-whe n 70 per cent of the American,35
NA,people say that they no longer believe their,35
NA,Administration on Vietnam. Yet the Amer-,35
NA,ican Administration has been infinitely,35
NA,more truthful with its people than any of,35
NA,the Australian governments since 1965.,35
NA,"Brigadier Serong, formerly with the Task",35
NA,"Porce in Vietnam, told the truth when he",35
NA,said in Canberra in January that the role,35
NA,of the Australian Army in Vietnam had,35
NA,always been political. Politics determined,35
NA,our going in and politics are determining,35
NA,our coming out.,35
NA,Politics sent in the first battalion in,35
NA,"1965. The political situation in Australia,",35
NA,"not the military situation in Phuoc Tuy,",35
NA,decided Mr Holt on a second escalation of,35
NA,our commitment in 1966 and a third esca-,35
NA,lation in 1967. It was the political situation,35
NA,of February 1968 that induced the present,35
NA,"Minister for Defence ( Mr Gorton), then",35
NA,"Prime Minister, to announce immediately",35
NA,after the Tet offensive that no more troops,35
NA,would be sent to Vietnam. It was the politi-,35
NA,cal situation in 1969 that persuaded him,35
NA,"to say that it must be one out all out, that",35
NA,"a phased withdrawal, as I proposed, would",35
NA,endanger the lives of the troops remaining.,35
Mr MORRISON ,Wh o said that?,35
Mr WHITLAM,Th e immediate past,35
NA,"Prime Minister, the present Minister for",35
NA,Defence. It was the political situation of,35
NA,1970 that forced him to announce that the,35
NA,"withdrawal would, after all, be piecemeal.",35
NA,"It is the political situation, not the situ-",35
NA,ation in Phuoc Tuy Province or Vietnam or,35
NA,"Indo-China, that has prescribed the terms",35
NA,of the announcement today by the new,35
NA,Prime Minister. And it will be the political,35
NA,situation of 1972 that will spell the end of,35
NA,our commitment altogether. Never in its,35
NA,history has the Australian Army been so,35
NA,shamefully treated. It is a remarkable trib-,35
NA,ute to the honour of the Australian Army,35
NA,that it has so steadfastly served so dishon-,35
NA,"ourable a government, so disgraceful a",35
NA,policy.,35
NA,The Prime Minister's statement contains,35
NA,perhaps the most disturbing indication of,35
NA,policy since the commitment. For the,35
NA,alarming fact is that the forces remaining,35
NA,situin Vietnam are being endangered for,35
NA,reasons of sheer political expediency. The,35
NA,Government proposes to achieve a statis-,35
NA,tical reduction in the number of personnel,35
NA,in Vietnam; that is the minimum reduction,35
NA,required by the politics of Vietnam. It,35
NA,proposes to do this by trimming the sup-,35
NA,port for the 2 combat battalions remaining.,35
NA,A force of 2 battalions is itself,35
NA,dangerously unbalanced. Their security,35
NA,"requires more, not less, support. The force",35
NA,"is now dangerously exposed, more so than",35
NA,at any time since it arrived in Vietnam. It,35
NA,is folly to believe that the reduced level of,35
NA,Vietcong activity in Phuoc Tuy Province,35
NA,means long term security for Australia's,35
NA,forces there. We delude ourselves if we,35
NA,think that this reduced activity in Phuoc,35
NA,Tuy and throughout South Vietnam is sole-,35
NA,May ly the result of allied superiority over the,35
NA,"Vietcong forces. It is also, the result of a de-",35
NA,cision by the Vietcong and Hanoi them-,35
NA,selves. They will not undertake military,35
NA,actions which would pave the effect of,35
NA,seriously slowing down or reversing the,35
NA,"American withdrawal., Hanoi , and Washing-",35
NA,ton are in unspoken accord on this point-,35
NA,that the American withdrawal must go on,35
NA,as rapidly as possible. The Australian Gov-,35
NA,ernment is placing our troops in a position,35
NA,of dependence on decisions of their adver-,35
NA,saries. If it suits the enemy to raise the,35
NA,"level of activity in Phuoc Tuy, they can do",35
NA,it and they will do it. at a time when our,35
NA,troops have been rendered most vulner-,35
NA,able. This Government is placing Aus-,35
NA,tralian soldiers in jeopardy.,35
NA,The extent to which. political consider-,35
NA,ations are deciding the Australian Govern-,35
NA,ment's actions in Vietnam are exposed by,35
NA,the phoney preliminaries .of this announce-,35
NA,ment-th e Minister for Defence's farcical,35
NA,"visit to Vietnam. His, predecessor was",35
NA,"booked to go to Vietnam for 10 days, so",35
NA,he went for 4. His predecessor had created,35
NA,a Cabinet convulsion because of allegations,35
NA,that the Army had unilaterally decided tp,35
NA,curtail civil aid; so the new Minister for,35
NA,"Defence, having himself chosen that port-",35
NA,folio to give the honourable member for,35
NA,Wannon ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) a slap in,36
NA,"the face, pointedly spent most of his time",36
NA,inspecting our civil aid projects. Does,36
NA,body believe that today's announcement,36
NA,owes anything to such insights or know-,36
NA,ledge as the Minister for Defence may,36
NA,have gained in his 4 days in Vietnam?,36
NA,Nothing so fully epitomises the whole,36
NA,approach of this Government to the Viet-,36
NA,nam commitment from its inception.,36
NA,Nothing so fully epitomises the Govern-,36
NA,ment's total lack of understanding of the,36
NA,Indo-China catastrophe as fhe Minister for,36
NA,Defence's statements on the operation in,36
NA,Laos. His considered judgment was that,36
NA,"the operation had been, and. I quote his",36
NA,very words: 'about four times as successful,36
NA,as the Press had made out'.,36
NA,"Ever since the war began to go sour, its",36
NA,sponsors have blamed the Press. In fact all,36
NA,that has happened is that the Press could,36
NA,not for ever suppress the realities of this,36
NA,war. This is what fhe Australian Govern-,36
NA,ment resents. It resents that Indo-China,36
NA,refuses to fit into its own preconceptions,36
NA,"and preoccupations or, as the Prime Minis-",36
NA,ter himself pnt it last year when as Minis-,36
NA,ter for External Affairs he was speaking on,36
NA,Cambodia: 'it does not readily fit into my,36
NA,framework'. In Australia and overwhelm-,36
NA,ingly in the Australian Press the war did,36
NA,initially enjoy a great deal of support. This,36
NA,was based not only on. the natural patrio-,36
NA,tism of the Australian people but on a,36
NA,predisposition to believe that their govern-,36
NA,ment would tell the truth. People in a,36
NA,democracy are reluctant to think that their,36
NA,elected government is party to lies and,36
NA,"deception, particularly in matters involving",36
NA,the Armed Forces and the nation's security.,36
NA,In 1965 rhe people were inclined to,36
NA,"accept that our commitment was justified,",36
NA,"not to say required, by the American alli-",36
NA,ance. The Government sold its case on the,36
NA,basis that America would be strengthened,36
NA,in our region and that our commitment,36
NA,would strengthen the alliance. Now of,36
NA,course people have had it brought home to,36
NA,"them that, as a result of Vietnam, the",36
NA,United States will never again intervene on,36
NA,land in Asia and that the American Con-,36
NA,gress and people are bitterly resentful of,36
NA,those who they believe inveigled them into,36
NA,this imbroglio which has deeply divided,36
NA,"their country', 'alienated their youth;",36
NA,demoralised their army and disrupted their,36
NA,economy.,36
NA,This has been the end result of Aus-,36
NA,tralia's conduct as far as the United States,36
NA,any- is concerned. All these negative results,36
NA,have been achieved at the price of the dev-,36
NA,astation of Indo-China. We are leaving,36
NA,Vietnam; but what are we leaving? By pro-,36
NA,longing the war we have put a political,36
NA,solution further and further away and,36
NA,made a political solution more and more,36
NA,difficult ever to achieve. Our real military,36
NA,achievement has been to raise the level of,36
NA,violence to unprecedented heights. Three,36
NA,times the weight of bombs have been,36
NA,dropped as were dropped in the Second,36
NA,World War. In a kind of unholy alliance,36
NA,"with Russia and China, we have provided",36
NA,the 2 Vietnams with almost limitless capac-,36
NA,ity for mutual self-destruction. We are,36
NA,leaving 2 of the world's largest armies to,36
NA,confront each other. We have exchanged a,36
NA,neutral ancl peaceful Cambodia for war,36
NA,and chaos. In Laos we have undermined,36
NA,the neutralist settlement of 1962. In South,36
NA,Vietnam itself we are leaving a regime,36
NA,which carries within itself the seeds of,36
NA,inevitable failure. Even if the Thieu regime,36
NA,"were reformist or democratic, it has 2",36
NA,insuperable disqualifications for genuine,36
NA,support in that country. It is a regime visi-,36
NA,bly dependant on outside support-foreig n,36
NA,support-i n a country with a thousand,36
NA,years' history of rebellion against foreign,36
NA,"dominance. Secondly, it is committed to, it",36
NA,"in fact embodies, the concept of keeping",36
NA,Vietnam divided. This is an impossible,36
NA,"basis for popular support in any nation,",36
NA,much less a nation with the history of,36
NA,Vietnam. What we have done in Vietnam,36
NA,is to give the Communists a monopoly of,36
NA,"the issues of nationalism, independence",36
NA,and unity.,36
NA,The Australian Government now has no,36
NA,recognisable or achievable war aims in,36
NA,Vietnam. It has no influence on events in,36
NA,Vietnam. It has no role in Vietnam. Viet-,36
NA,namisation is not a solution or a settlement-,36
NA,for Vietnam; it is the means the United,36
NA,States has chosen to secure the withdrawal,36
NA,of her combat forces. The justification,36
NA,President Nixon has given for expanding,36
NA,the war into Cambodia and Laos is that it,36
NA,was necessary to ensure the safe with-,36
NA,drawal of American troops. However,36
NA,"much we may deplore the means, let us at",36
NA,"least accept the aim-th e safest, quickest",36
NA,withdrawal. The method chosen by the,36
NA,Australian Government is neither quick,36
NA,nor safe. It is monstrous that Australian,37
NA,lives should be endangered simply because,37
NA,this Government refuses to admit its folly.,37
NA,How long must the courage of Australian,37
NA,soldiers be used to cover ihe cowardice of,37
NA,Australian Ministers?,37
NA,DRIED FRUITS RESEARCH BILL,37
NA,Second Reading,37
NA,Debate resumed (vide page 1147).,37
Mr TURNBULL ,Mallee) (4.38)-,37
NA,Before the Prime Minister ( Mr MCMahon),37
NA,made his ministerial statement we were,37
NA,discussing 3 Bills in connection with the,37
NA,dried fruits industry. These Bills are the,37
NA,"Dried Fruits Research Bill 1971, the Dried",37
NA,Fruits Levy Bill 1971 and the Dried Fruits,37
NA,Levy Collection Bill 1971. The honourable,37
NA,"member for Dawson (Dr Patterson), who",37
NA,"was the previous speaker in this debate,",37
NA,explained the provisions of the Dried it.,37
NA,Fruits Levy Bill and the Dried Fruits Levy,37
NA,Collection Bill. He also spoke about the,37
NA,"Dried Fruits Research Bill, which is",37
NA,main BiH of the three. There is no need,37
NA,for me to go over the technical parts,37
NA,the Bills with which the honourable,37
NA,"ber for Dawson has dealt, because anyone",37
NA,who was listening to him would have,37
NA,heard this explained and others can read,37
NA,Hansard what the honourable member had,37
NA,to say. The honourable member for Daw-,37
NA,son said that the Opposition supports these Dr Price said:,37
NA,Bills. I appreciate that announcement very,37
NA,much and there is not very much for me and,37
NA,to say in that regard.,37
NA,I represent at least twice as many dried He said:,37
NA,fruits growers as all other members of the,37
NA,"House of Representatives combined. poUtical,",37
NA,"Therefore, I am very concerned with anyScience",37
NA,thing that happens in the dried fruits the world market.,37
NA,industry. I am most happy with the Dried,37
NA,Fruits Research Bill which has been,37
NA,approved by State Ministers for Agriculindustry. He said:,37
NA,ture and the Australian Dried Fruits Associ-,37
NA,ation and which is generally accepted by opment,37
NA,growers. I would like to make one or two greater,37
NA,remarks. I do not want to repeat what has crops.,37
NA,been said by the honourable member for,37
NA,Dawson for I am always a great co-operatries,37
NA,tor if I get the opportunity. It is only,37
NA,I think that what has been said by some,37
NA,members is not right that I try to put them,37
NA,"right, but never in a personal way.",37
NA,The Bill is in line with the normal,37
NA,Government procedure of providing matchabout,37
NA,ing contributions on a $1 for $1 basis to,37
NA,meet expenditure on approved research,37
NA,projects. One thing about the Bill with,37
NA,which I am very pleased and which has not,37
NA,been mentioned in the debate is that the,37
NA,funds provided by the industry and the,37
NA,Commonwealth will be used only for addi-,37
NA,tional research. Excellent research work,37
NA,1971 is already being undertaken by the State,37
NA,departments of agriculture and the Com-,37
NA,monwealth Scientific and Industrial Re-,37
NA,"search Organisation, especially at the",37
NA,Merbein station of the CSIRO which was,37
NA,"extended recently at a cost of $120,000.",37
NA,That station has done splendid work for the,37
NA,dried fruits industry and it will continue,37
NA,under this Bill in its usual capacity. The,37
NA,staff there numbers 70. It has an annual,37
NA,"budget of about $500,000. The station has",37
NA,been operating for 50 years. The people,37
NA,of the area are quite rightly very proud of,37
NA,There was quite a crowd at Merbein,37
NA,when the extensions to the CSIRO station,37
NA,"the were opened by the Minister for Works,",37
NA,Senator Wright. Also present were CSIRO,37
NA,of executives. I quote from the 'Sunraysia,37
NA,"memDaily' what was said by Dr Price, the",37
NA,"Chairman of the CSIRO, when speaking",37
NA,at the opening of the new administration,37
NA,in building and library at the CSIRO division,37
NA,of horticultural research station at Merbein.,37
NA,"Scientists, by showing how to produce efficiently",37
NA,"economically, did point tlie way to an",37
NA,"abundance of production, but at the same time",37
NA,research did lead to improved quality.,37
NA,Primary industry faced problems that were,37
NA,social and economic as well . . .,37
NA,had shown the way to compete better on,37
NA,He pointed to colour and cleanliness as 2,37
NA,ways research bad helped the dried fruits,37
NA,Science in agriculture also has aided the devel-,37
NA,"of new markets, diversification and given",37
NA,flexibility to production and marketing of,37
NA,"Generally speaking, in all primary indus-",37
NA,throughout Australia there has been,37
NA,"when some research, more in some industries",37
NA,than in others. The Australian dried fruits,37
NA,industry is one which requires continual,37
NA,"research, perhaps more than any other",37
NA,industry. I think I am right in saying that,37
NA,50 years ago the research station of,37
NA,the CSIRO at Merbein started to operate,38
NA,because of an outbreak of fungus black,38
NA,spot. The station has been operating ever,38
NA,since. Black spot and all sorts of pests,38
NA,have cut down the volume and the quality,38
NA,"of dried fruits. This Bill, in addition to",38
NA,what the CSIRO and the State departments,38
NA,"of agriculture do, will add greatly to effec-",38
NA,tiveness by showing growers how they can,38
NA,overcome at least what is possible to over-,38
NA,come of the menaces that sap the dried,38
NA,fruits industry of its economic wealth.,38
NA,The dried fruits industry is a very great,38
NA,export industry. I refer to the 'Australian,38
NA,Handbook' for 1971 which points out that,38
NA,from 1930 to 1939 the dried fruits produc-,38
NA,"tion averaged 70,000 tons and for the",38
NA,seasons from 1950 tr> 1959 the average was,38
NA,"78,389. It is necessary to have irrigation",38
NA,for growing grapes for dried fruits. The,38
NA,Handbook points out that the irrigated,38
NA,"areas produced 85,000 tons of dried vine",38
NA,"fruits in the 1967-68 season, and 67,000",38
NA,tons of these were exported. The 1968-69,38
NA,crop was severely affected by heavy rain,38
NA,and was 40 per cent below average. This,38
NA,"year again the crop is very low, I am sorry",38
NA,to say. Growers are concerned about the,38
NA,general prospects. I have kept in close,38
NA,"touch with the industry, which is situated",38
NA,chiefly in the Mallee electorate. I have cor-,38
NA,responded with people when I could not,38
NA,visit them due to my attendance in tbis,38
NA,chamber.,38
NA,The honourable member for Dawson,38
NA,spoke about stabilisation. I think that any,38
NA,primary industry that is not stabilised is,38
NA,out of touch with reality. A number of,38
NA,years ago the stabilisation of the dried,38
NA,fruits industry was started and ran for,38
NA,"quite a period. As has been stated, about",38
NA,12 months ago or a little more the growers,38
NA,in a poll refused to give their approval to,38
NA,the stabilisation plan that was put forward,38
NA,by the Government. I think that 65 per,38
NA,cent of the growers voted for it and about,38
NA,35 per cent against it. A statutory number,38
NA,"of votes was required, not just a simple",38
NA,"majority, so the stabilisation plan suggested",38
NA,by the Government on that occasion,38
NA,lapsed. I would like the Minister for,38
NA,Primary Industry ( Mr Sinclair) when he is,38
NA,replying in this debate to give some esti-,38
NA,mate of what the dried fruits industry,38
NA,might have lost by not supporting stabilisa-,38
NA,"tion. It has been stated, that there has been",38
NA,a split in the dried fruits industry. This is,38
NA,"right to a certain extent, but it is right",38
NA,"only in relation to that vote, because cer-",38
NA,tain people in the industry advised growers,38
NA,to vote against the proposition.,38
NA,The greatest trouble was the apathy of,38
NA,growers who thought that the proposal,38
NA,would be carried quite easily and did not,38
NA,vote at all. 1 know that the Minister has,38
NA,had long and serious discussions with rep-,38
NA,resentatives of the ADFA. 1 hope-h e may,38
NA,tell us this-tha t he is reaching a stage,38
NA,where another proposition for stabilisation,38
NA,will be submitted to the growers. It is my,38
NA,prediction that this time they will not let it,38
NA,pass by. They will vote for it and so will,38
NA,have stabilisation. I regard the dried fruits,38
NA,industry as one of the most precarious,38
NA,industries of all. First of all the crop is,38
NA,supposed to show a certain production.,38
NA,The growers say that the sugar has come,38
NA,down into it. It is sometimes hard to get,38
NA,pickers. When the grower does get pickers,38
NA,and the crop is picked and put on the,38
NA,"racks, his troubles usually continue. The",38
NA,grower does not know what his return will,38
NA,be even when the crop is in the packing,38
NA,shed for then there is the situation with,38
NA,markets and the world conditions.,38
NA,The reasonable attitude adopted by the,38
NA,honourable member for Dawson in this,38
NA,debate is appreciated. I support the Bill,38
NA,very strongly. The honourable member,38
NA,said that in the Committee stages the,38
NA,Opposition will move 2 amendments. I,38
NA,shall wait to see what they are before I,38
NA,can comment on them. The growers rep-,38
NA,resentatives in negotiation with the Gov-,38
NA,ernment and with all the Ministers of,38
NA,Agriculture have brought forward a Bill,38
NA,very acceptable to this Parliament and to,38
NA,"that great primary producing unit, the",38
NA,dried fruits industry.,38
NA,I refer now to increased plantings. There,38
NA,is some concern in the dried fruits industry,38
NA,that increased plantings may bring about,38
NA,"quantities of grapes, especially dried fruit",38
NA,"grapes, that the growers may not be able",38
NA,to market. I do not want to say more,38
NA,"about this, because the matter of increased",38
NA,plantings is definitely in the hands of the,38
NA,State governments. The Commonwealth,38
NA,Government has nothing whatever to do,38
NA,with it and can perhaps only offer advice,38
NA,on the subject. It is not my idea to offer,38
NA,"advice on it here today, but in my elector-",38
NA,ate I am always willing to meet people and,38
NA,discuss the matter with them. I support the,38
NA,Bill. 1 believe it will be in the best interests,39
NA,"of the industry, of the exports that benefit",39
NA,"Australia, and of the Commonwealth gen-",39
NA,erally.,39
NA,Mr FitzPATRICK (Darling) (4.49)- I,39
NA,cannot understand why the honourable,39
NA,member for Mallee ( Mr Turnbull) made a,39
NA,point of informing the House that he rep-,39
NA,resents more dried fruit growers than any,39
NA,other honourable member. Of course there,39
NA,are many fruit growers in my electorate.,39
NA,Whether they represent the largest number,39
NA,of fruit growers in any electorate does not,39
NA,seem to me to be the most important issue in,39
NA,this debate. Whether or not they represent,39
NA,"the greatest number, they are entitled to",39
NA,"good representation in this Parliament, and",39
NA,honourable members on this side of the,39
NA,House intend to see that they gel such repre-,39
NA,sentation. Mention was made of the stabilis-,39
NA,ation scheme and the fact that some of the,39
NA,growers failed to vote on this very impor-,39
NA,"tant issue. Of course, it is well known why",39
NA,they did not vote. It was because they,39
NA,were not satisfied with the proposition that,39
NA,"was being put forward, and they wanted",39
NA,some say in the alteration of the proposi-,39
NA,tion. The honourable member for Mallee,39
NA,mentioned that a new stabilisation scheme,39
NA,has been considered. It is to be hoped that,39
NA,greater notice will be taken of the growers',39
NA,opinion in the formulation of the new,39
NA,scheme and that greater consideration will,39
NA,be given to their wishes in the matter.,39
NA,I support in principle the establishment,39
NA,of rhe Dried Fruits Research Trust,39
NA,Account mentioned in the Dried Fruits,39
NA,"Research Bill 1971. However, I consider",39
NA,that many of the clauses of the Bill are,39
NA,obnoxious in that they fail to guarantee the,39
NA,grower any real representation on the pro-,39
NA,posed Dried Fruits Research Committee.,39
NA,These clauses must create the impression,39
NA,in the grower's mind that he will have,39
NA,little or no say regarding the direction that,39
NA,research will take. Clause 11 states:,39
NA,The Committee shall consist of-,39
NA,(a) four persons to represent the organisation,39
NA,known as the Australian Dried Fruits,39
NA,Association;,39
NA,(b) two persons to represent the packers of,39
NA,dried fruits;,39
NA,(c) three persons to represent the organisation,39
NA,known as the Australian Agricultural,39
NA,CouncU;,39
NA,(d) one person to represent the CommonweaUh,39
NA,Scienlific and Industrial Research OrganisaThe,39
NA,tion: and,39
NA,(e) one person to represent the Department of,39
NA,Primary Industry.,39
NA,"In other words, on the Committee, there is",39
NA,not to be direct representation of the dried,39
NA,fruit grower; yet he is the one most depen-,39
NA,dent on the results of research. It is evi-,39
NA,dent from the wording of the Dried Fruits,39
NA,"Levy Bill that this Government, irrespec-",39
NA,tive of its wishes regarding the composition,39
NA,"of the Committee, leaves no doubt which",39
NA,group it thinks should pay the piper. Of,39
NA,course this is not any of the groups men-,39
NA,tioned in the clause relating to the com-,39
NA,position of the Committee. These groups,39
NA,will have all the say about where the,39
NA,"research will take place, who shall be",39
NA,"trained for the purpose of such research,",39
NA,"and the publication of reports, periodicals,",39
NA,books and papers in connection with such,39
NA,research. As far as the grower is concerned,39
NA,everything is done in an indirect manner in,39
NA,regard to the dried fruits research. Until,39
NA,we reach the point at which it is decided,39
NA,who should pay the levy lo support the,39
NA,Dried Fruits Research Committee's,39
NA,expenses and the expenses involved in car-,39
NA,"rying out its decisions, it is very indirect.",39
NA,But from this point on the Bill leaves no,39
NA,doubt that it is the grower who is expected,39
NA,to pay. Clause 5(1.) of the Dried Fruits,39
NA,Levy Collection Bill is one of the most vis-,39
NA,cious clauses in that Bill. It states:,39
NA,. . . levy on dried fruits of a season received,39
NA,for packing on or before the thirtieth day of Sep-,39
NA,tember in that season is due for payment on the,39
NA,thirtieth day of November in that season.,39
NA,"This means that the grower, who at pre-",39
NA,sent is badly in need of credit and often,39
NA,has to wait more than 2 years to receive,39
NA,"payment for his dried fruiis, is now",39
NA,expected to pay this extra levy in 3,39
NA,months. If he cannot pay the levy in 3,39
NA,months he then has to pay interest on the,39
NA,amount to the extent of 10 per cent per,39
NA,annum. It appears to me that whoever,39
NA,drew up this Bill gave little or DO consider-,39
NA,"ation to the very serious economic, situa-",39
NA,tion of the dried fruit industry. The Bill,39
NA,provides ample protection for the packers.,39
NA,This is given in swch clauses as clause 9 of,39
NA,"the Dried Fruits Levy Collection Bill,",39
NA,which states:,39
NA,Where the packer of any dried fruits received,39
NA,"for packing has paid a levy on those dried fruits,",39
NA,he is entitled lo recover the amount of that levy,39
NA,from the grower of the dried fruits as a debt due,39
NA,to the packer from thc grower.,39
NA,Government is also protected because,39
NA,not only is the interest rate on unpaid levy,39
NA,10 per cent but the grower Ls also liable to,39
NA,a fine of $200. if he fails or neglects to,40
NA,furnish a return or information that he is,40
NA,required under the regulations to furnish.,40
NA,This provision can be found in clause 11,40
NA,of the Dried Fruits Levy Collection Bill.,40
NA,"In addition, a prosecution for an offence",40
NA,against this proposed section may be com-,40
NA,menced at any time within 5 years after,40
NA,the commission of the offence. This clause,40
NA,will be the subject of the amendment we,40
NA,have foreshadowed in the Committee stage.,40
NA,I believe that the whole spirit of this,40
NA,takes no cognisance of the grave economic,40
NA,position of the dried fruits industry. It does,40
NA,not consider what is to happen to the,40
NA,grower who pays the levy. The products,40
NA,have to pass inspection to ensure that the,40
NA,"citrus, dried or canned fruits are whole-",40
NA,some and fit for consumption; that they,40
NA,will in fact conform to specifications. Bu:,40
NA,when the producer makes a purchase of,40
NA,pesticide or spray chemical he receives no,40
NA,such guarantee of effectiveness. As has,40
NA,"already been mentioned in this Parliament,",40
NA,a particular case is that of citrus red scale.,40
NA,There is nil tolerance for rod scale on cit-,40
NA,rus fruit packed for export. The grower is,40
NA,forced to spray the fruit nr his fruit will,40
NA,not be accepted. Yet grower-financed tests,40
NA,have shown that of 20-odd brands of a,40
NA,recommended chemical onlv one will con-,40
NA,sistently kill red scale. There i.s no Govern-,40
NA,"ment inspectorial service in m..s field, and",40
NA,yet many of the growers say that spray,40
NA,chemical bills exceed their net taxable,40
NA,income.,40
NA,In the production of sultanas it is well,40
NA,known that prices are low and costs are,40
NA,high. The seemingly obvious answer is to,40
NA,produce more tons per acre. The growers',40
NA,organisation already contributes a large,40
NA,sum towards research into better root,40
NA,stocks and high producing cones for graft-,40
NA,ing on to them. I am told that they are,40
NA,"now available for planting in Mildura, bu!",40
NA,a. man-made rule decrees that vines,40
NA,certified in Victoria may not be planted in,40
NA,South Australia. The whole of this,40
NA,research must be duplicated in South Aus-,40
NA,"tralia, and while the grower waits there",40
NA,comes the really serious blow. Growers,40
NA,completely new to the industry are taking,40
NA,the improved varieties and planting large,40
NA,areas further upstream. While the present,40
NA,"production is already in excess of demand,",40
NA,of course this can only depress further the,40
NA,present low prices. The new grower will,40
NA,survive because he is on virgin soil witb,40
NA,high per acre production. The struggling,40
NA,grower who paid for the research will not,40
NA,be able to afford to replant his property.,40
NA,What guarantee has the grower that the,40
NA,same sort of thing will not happen under,40
NA,"this new Dried Fruits Research Act, when",40
NA,there is no reai protection written into the,40
NA,Act that directly concerns the grower? It,40
NA,must also be remembered that there comes,40
NA,a time when further increases in efficiency,40
NA,are just not possible due to limitations,40
NA,Bill imposed by high soil salinity and other,40
NA,matters. At this point the dried fruits,40
NA,grower can add to the size of his property,40
NA,or get out. Yet he is forced to pay a levy,40
NA,which will help others produce more and,40
NA,thus put him out of business more quickly.,40
NA,Due to his precarious credit position he is,40
NA,often unable to purchase the property next,40
NA,"door so that he can increase, his production",40
NA,and allow a dignified retreat for his neigh-,40
NA,bour. Both continue to eke out an exis-,40
NA,tence on their increasingly unecpnomically-,40
NA,sized properties. At the same time they see,40
NA,Government support and encouragement,40
NA,given to new outside finance to come on,40
NA,"new land and plant 200 acres pf apricots,",40
NA,"500 acres of citrus and nearly 1,000 acres",40
NA,of wine grapes.,40
NA,In the light of this it would .be reason-,40
NA,able to expect other sections ofthese Bills,40
NA,to assist the grower or give him a further,40
NA,say in the way in which the research will,40
NA,be directed. But this is not the case and it,40
NA,"appears, as we look further into the",40
NA,"clauses of the Bill, that less and less con-",40
NA,sideration seems to be given to the know-,40
NA,"ledge, experience and wishes of the grow-",40
NA,"er. To indicate this, let us examine section",40
NA,11. (5.) of the Dried Fruits Research Trust,40
NA,Account Bill which says:,40
NA,Tbe appointment of a nominated member is not,40
NA,invalidated and shall not be called in question by,40
NA,reason of a defect or irregularity iri' connexion,40
NA,with his nomination -' - ',40
NA,Section 13. (I.) says:,40
NA,A membei may. with the approval of ihe,40
NA,"Minister, appoint a person to be his deputy.1",40
NA,My point is that a member could be,40
NA,appointed to the Committee in 'spite of a,40
NA,defect or irregularity. Not only could he,40
NA,retain his seat in spite of this defect or,40
NA,irregularity; he could appoint as' his deputy,40
NA,someone else who was even less entitled to,40
NA,act on this Committee. If the member,40
NA,elected by defect or irregularity were the,40
NA,chairman of the Committee! his deputy,40
NA,could then act as chairman. In my opinion,41
NA,this is far outside the wishes of the pro-,41
NA,ducer and shows a disregard for his wel-,41
NA,fare. These growers should have access to,41
NA,the best advice and advisers in the indus-,41
NA,"try, people who should be able to make a",41
NA,decision for the grower and who are not,41
NA,influenced by any political leaning. These,41
NA,decisions should be made only after full,41
NA,consultation with the growers. The only,41
NA,conclusion that one can reach after a close,41
NA,study of these Bills is that they offer no,41
NA,signposts to the future but lay down plenty,41
NA,of controls and penalties for the grower,41
NA,who ts asked to pay the costs of their,41
NA,implementation.,41
NA,If this Government really wanted to,41
NA,help the dried fruit growers it would have,41
NA,introduced long before now the new dried,41
NA,fruits stabilisation scheme which has been,41
NA,talked about for so long. Also it would,41
NA,ensure that information already gathered,41
NA,"by Government departments, such as",41
NA,departments of agriculture and the Com-,41
NA,monwealth Scientific and Industrial,41
NA,"Research Organisation, as mentioned by",41
NA,the honourable member for Mallee ( Mr,41
NA,"Turnbull), is available to all growers and",41
NA,not only those in areas that enjoy a rural,41
NA,broadcasting programme. During the last,41
NA,session both the honourable member for,41
NA,Mallee and the honourable member for,41
NA,Angas ( Mr Giles) made this point. They,41
NA,pointed out the great disadvantage that,41
NA,fruit growers in the Sunraysia area suffered,41
NA,because they did not have a rural broad-,41
NA,casting programme. It is not the intention,41
NA,of honourable members on this side of the,41
NA,"House to oppose these Bills. However, we",41
NA,say that due regard should be given to,41
NA,some of these problems. The grower is,41
NA,entitled to be told that he is a part of any,41
NA,scheme claimed to have been introduced,41
NA,for his welfare. He is entitled to feel part,41
NA,of it. He can feel part of it only if he is,41
NA,given equal rights on the Committee and,41
NA,equal rights to say where research will take,41
NA,place. I hope honourable members opposite,41
NA,will give some consideration to these mat-,41
NA,ters.,41
Mr GRASSBY ,Riverina) (5.06)- I rise,41
NA,"with great pleasure to follow my colleague,",41
NA,the honourable member for Darling ( Mr,41
NA,"FitzPatrick), who has given a masterly",41
NA,exposition of the problems that confront,41
NA,dried fruits growers at the present time. He,41
NA,has also dissected the legislation before us,41
NA,in a particularly commendable way. I am,41
NA,delighted to be able to follow the honourable,41
NA,member and pay him that compliment. I,41
NA,stand with him in the comments he made,41
NA,about the serious problems facing the dried,41
NA,fruits industry at the present time.,41
NA,Mr Turnbull-Wha t about the honour-,41
NA,able member for Dawson?,41
Mr GRASSBY,"M y friend, the honour-",41
NA,able member for Mallee interjects and,41
NA,asks me: 'What about the honourable,41
NA,member for Dawson?' I may say that,41
NA,the honourable member for Dawson (Dr,41
NA,Patterson) led for the Opposition in this,41
NA,debate and we on this side of the House,41
NA,are at one with him. There is no need,41
NA,for the honourable meniber for Mallee,41
NA,to be concerned with the Opposition; he,41
NA,shbuld apply himself to some of the pro-,41
NA,blems facing the industry which are rather,41
NA,more urgent than was indicated by the,41
NA,Minister for Primary Industry ( Mr,41
NA,Sinclair). I agree with the honourable,41
NA,member for Darling that it does not matter,41
NA,whether we have a greater or lesser number,41
NA,of growers. We stand with them and serve,41
NA,them to tbe best of our ability. The references,41
NA,the honourable member made to industry,41
NA,stabilisation are very much to the point.,41
NA,There is a desire in the industry generally,41
NA,"to see a stabilisation programme, but the",41
NA,industry wants to see discussions continued,41
NA,not on the basis of the Government's,41
NA,"edict of take it or leave it, whatever propo-",41
NA,"sition is put forward by the Government, but",41
NA,on the basis of taking into account all the,41
NA,"doubts, worries and concerns that my",41
NA,colleague mentioned in relation to stabilisa-,41
NA,tion in the future. The honourable member,41
NA,did a very fine service in referring to the,41
NA,need for regional broadcasting services. This,41
NA,"is something that all honourable members,",41
NA,"from both sides of the Murray, are con-",41
NA,"cerned about, and I hope we will not lose",41
NA,sight of this need. It seems to me to be,41
NA,pretty disgraceful that in Australia at the,41
NA,present time there are areas in the South-,41
NA,east corner of the continent that just cannot,41
NA,get good radio reception. I am sure this is,41
NA,a problem in the Congo Republic but we,41
NA,do not expect it in Australia in 1971. How-,41
NA,"ever, this is what we have got.",41
NA,In relation to the measures before us the,41
NA,Minister for Primary Industry in his second,41
NA,reading speech did not seem to be fully,41
NA,seized with the seriousness of the problems,41
NA,the industry faces. Let me quote a fraction,42
NA,of his speech. He said:,42
NA,Dried fruit production is of considerable economic,42
NA,importance to the rural communities where these,42
NA,fruits are grown and exports of dried fruits con-,42
NA,tribute significantly to our export earnings.,42
NA,They are not just of considerable economic,42
NA,importance to some of these communities;,42
NA,they are the life and death of these com-,42
NA,munities. I think this should be recognised.,42
NA,The Minister went on to say:,42
NA,"In common with other primary industries, dried",42
NA,"fruit producers are faced with rising costs,",42
NA,increasing competition in world markets and more,42
NA,stringent standards imposed by importing countries.,42
NA,This is as much as to say that these are the,42
NA,normal sorts of things the Government deals,42
NA,with and there is no real cause for special,42
NA,concern. I feel this is a great understate-,42
NA,ment of the position. It may be due to lack,42
NA,of knowledge of the position. In the dried,42
NA,fruits industry we should recognise that,42
NA,"more than in any other industry, disaster",42
NA,is endemic and in nearly every other year,42
NA,the industry has to face a crisis either in,42
NA,"marketing or, and particularly, in relation",42
NA,to the weather and the crop. Yet every,42
NA,year that it has been in existence in this,42
NA,century no basic measures have been,42
NA,taken to remove some of this lack of,42
NA,security. I refer particularly to the fact,42
NA,that even at this stage we are considering a,42
NA,research proposal- a measure to improve,42
NA,industry research and to make funds avail-,42
NA,able for a better approach to problems,42
NA,within the industry. As a principle the,42
NA,Opposition has always supported the need,42
NA,for increased and improved industry,42
NA,research. Tbe 2 things are not always syn-,42
NA,"onymous, but I make that point quite",42
NA,clearly. We have before us a measure,42
NA,"which says, in effect, that we are dedicated",42
NA,to further research to improve the product,42
NA,"yet, at present, the Government has turned",42
NA,its face away from the position confronling,42
NA,"one of our major export markets, the",42
NA,United Kingdom. We still have no commit-,42
NA,ment from the Government about what,42
NA,will happen to the range of industries that,42
NA,will be affected by Britain's entry into the,42
NA,European Economic Community or her,42
NA,association with the European Common,42
NA,Market.,42
NA,J believe that in the quiet of the evening,42
NA,some members of the Government still get,42
NA,down on their knees and pray very hard,42
NA,that Britain does not enter the Community.,42
NA,This is their forward planning-the y pray,42
NA,desperately that tbe problem they see com-,42
NA,ing does not arise. This is a bankruptcy of,42
NA,thought. We have no commitment from,42
NA,the Government regarding the survival of,42
NA,these industries in the face of changes,42
NA,which must be made in advance of Britain,42
NA,entering the European EconomicCommu-,42
NA,"nity. This Bill relates to one industry, yet",42
NA,we have no Government commitment con-,42
NA,cerning that industry if Britain enters the,42
NA,European Economic Community. I suggest,42
NA,"that prayers, however commendable in the",42
NA,"dark of the evening, are not a substitute",42
NA,for action. Both should apply.,42
NA,Mr Turnbull-D o not make a joke of,42
NA,Christianity.,42
Mr GRASSBY,A n honourable member,42
NA,from the Government benches interjects,42
NA,that this is a joke. It is not a joke to the,42
NA,growers who have waited for many years,42
NA,for some semblance of action. We have,42
NA,been waiting for 50 years-no t that the,42
NA,honourable member for Mallee ( Mr Turn-,42
NA,"bull) has been in this place for 50 years,",42
NA,although he has been here for. a genera-,42
NA,tion-an d still we do not have a national,42
NA,disaster authority or a nations! disaster,42
NA,fund. We still do not have any national,42
NA,crop or livestock insurance provisions such,42
NA,as are enjoyed by our competitors in other,42
NA,countries. We do not have any of these,42
NA,things and yet Government members inter-,42
NA,"ject and say: 'Oh, some joking is going on'.",42
NA,There has been joking and lethargy for a,42
NA,generation and it is time it caine .to an end,42
NA,"because, after all, if we deal witb' the prob-",42
NA,lems of the industries in the dim future,42
NA,"instead of now, the industries will not sur-",42
NA,vive. The Pontius Pilate attitude of the,42
NA,"Government saying: 'We will', await the",42
NA,industry's desires; we will await ' advice,42
NA,from the States; and we will not establish,42
NA,any positive guidelines ourself jiist will not,42
NA,"do. However, I pay the Government, a trib-",42
NA,ute for being consistent in tliis regard. It,42
NA,has never said: 'We will give you' a lead' or,42
NA,;,42
NA,'We will take the lead'. What it has said is:,42
NA,'We will wait on the industry* or 'We will,42
NA,wait on the States'.,42
NA,Let us examine the position of the dried,42
NA,fruits industry. The refusal of the Victor-,42
NA,ian Government to control expansion of,42
NA,plantings of dual purpose or drying variety,42
NA,grapes has not been accepted as 'final by,42
NA,the Australian Dried Fruits Association.,42
NA,The Association has said that it will make,42
NA,a direct approach to the Government on,42
NA,this. The Association submits that over,43
NA,production already poses serious problems.,43
NA,The Association has had before it the,43
NA,report of the United States Department of,43
NA,Agriculture Foreign Agricultural Service,43
NA,that the combined world sultana produc-,43
NA,"tion is estimated at 704,900 tons or some 5",43
NA,per cent more than last year's production.,43
NA,The estimate of Australia's total sultana,43
NA,"production is 94,900 tons. It is obvious",43
NA,that there is a desire by the industry to see,43
NA,some action. Likewise there is a desire by,43
NA,a State to do something different. I am,43
NA,suggesting that the Commonwealth Gov-,43
NA,ernment cannot wash its hands once again,43
NA,in its recurring role of Pontius Pilate and,43
NA,say: 'We have no guidelines. We have no,43
NA,leadership to give. We will just have to,43
NA,await developments'. This is exactly the,43
NA,"kind of policy, or attitude, which has got",43
NA,Australia into serious difficulty with prac-,43
NA,tically every primary industry in the,43
NA,nation.,43
NA,There is a need for positive guidelines in,43
NA,relation to the dried fruits industry. There,43
NA,is a need for action on the 3 points that,43
NA,have been raised in this debate. There is,43
NA,need for stabilisation. As a matter of fact I,43
NA,would suggest that even before stabilisation,43
NA,there is a need for a firm commitment by,43
NA,the Government concerning the dried,43
NA,fruits industry if Britain enters,43
NA,Economic Community. If Britain enters,43
NA,that Community will the Government say:,43
NA,"'Well, this is bad for that industry. We",43
NA,have lost that export market. We will have,43
NA,to cut the industry down or cut it out'? We,43
NA,need a commitment now because obviously,43
NA,"action should, be intrain in advance of Bri-",43
NA,tain's entering the European Economic,43
NA,Community. This is the first point I raise.,43
NA,"Secondly, we should be taking all posGrassby)",43
NA,sible steps to confer with all sides of,43
NA,industry to ensure a basic stabilisation,43
NA,"scheme. Thirdly, the Government should",43
NA,make a commitment that the Opposition,43
NA,"has already made, namely, to establish",43
NA,national disaster fund which could be,43
NA,great and continuing value to the dried,43
NA,fruits industry. Concurrently or conjointly,43
NA,with that we should be exploring the poswrong.,43
NA,sible introduction of a national crop and,43
NA,livestock insurance fund which is needed,43
NA,and which has been needed all this,43
NA,or ever since primary industry was estab-,43
NA,lished. These are matters on which the,43
NA,Opposition has made commitments and I slightly.,43
NA,invite the Government to share our commit-,43
NA,ments. The Government is in power and it,43
NA,should be taking action now.,43
NA,I agree with the points that were made,43
NA,by thc honourable member for Darling,43
NA,about the present Act. There is always a,43
NA,tendency to impose the greatest burden on,43
NA,the producers. This has been revealed in,43
NA,many directions but as an Opposition we,43
NA,have said that we will support legislation,43
NA,which has the support of the industry or,43
NA,the overwhelming number of people in the,43
NA,industry. Despite growers' reservations,43
NA,"about the Bill, there is a great and con-",43
NA,tinuing need for improved ancl extended,43
NA,research. Because of that urgency members,43
NA,of the Opposition support the Bill. How-,43
NA,"ever, it is no use having measures such as",43
NA,this before the Parliament in isolation. In,43
NA,dealing with the great rural industries of,43
NA,this nation ihe fundamental problems,43
NA,should be acknowledged. I again express,43
NA,"my dismay that the Minister, in his second",43
NA,"reading speech, tended to dismiss the great",43
NA,problems of the industry and dealt with,43
NA,only this one facet. This is not good,43
NA,enough. It will not do and I suggest that,43
NA,while members of the Opposition accept,43
NA,this Bill they have served notice that they,43
NA,will expect a belter performance in relation,43
NA,to the other rural problems than they have,43
NA,the European seen this afternoon.,43
Mr TURNBULL ,Mallee)- Mr Deputy,43
NA,"Speaker, I wish to make a personal expla-",43
NA,nation.,43
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Drury)-,43
NA,Order! Does the honourable member claim,43
NA,to have been misrepresented?,43
Mr TURNBULL,Ver y much so. When,43
NA,the honourable member for Riverina ( Mr,43
NA,said that members cf the Govern-,43
NA,the ment go down on their knees at eventide,43
NA,and pray about Britain's possible entry,43
NA,into the European Common Market I,43
NA,interjected: 'Do not make a joke of Chris-,43
NA,a tianity'. The honourable member tried to,43
NA,of make out and have accepted that I iaid:,43
NA,'Do not make a joke of the present,43
NA,position of growers'. That was quite,43
NA,I objected to his reference to pray-,43
NA,ing which has certain associations with the,43
NA,Christian principles of members and of,43
NA,century people throughout Australia.,43
Mr GRASSBY ,Riverina)- Mr Deputy,43
NA,"Speaker, I have been misrepresented just",43
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! Does,44
NA,the honourable member claim to have been,44
NA,misrepresented?,44
Mr GRASSBY,Yes . I should not like,44
NA,the honourable member for Mallee ( Mr,44
NA,Turnbull) to put on record something,44
NA,about myself which is quite wrong. 1,44
NA,would point out that I did not hear his,44
NA,reference to Christianity at all. I would,44
NA,"assume that we are all Christians here, at",44
NA,least in spirit if not in practice.,44
Mr GILES ,Angas) (5.19)- Mr Deputv,44
NA,"Speaker, now that the little argument in",44
NA,the far corner has subsided I should like to,44
NA,say one or two words about the dried fruit,44
NA,industry in my electorate and in the elec-,44
NA,torate of the honourable member for Mal-,44
NA,lee ( Mr Turnbull). In the area that I repre-,44
NA,sent the growing of dried fruit has become,44
NA,proportionately less important to the econ-,44
NA,"omy of the district over recent years, so",44
NA,that the vast weight of opinion in relation,44
NA,"to these matters must now, of course,",44
NA,come from the next door electorate of my,44
NA,friend the honourable member for Mallee.,44
NA,"However, I have growers in my electorate",44
NA,and they expect to be represented and have,44
NA,their voices heard. They support the Aus-,44
NA,tralian Dried Fruits Association in prin-,44
NA,ciple but I would point out to honourable,44
NA,members who perhaps have not been in,44
NA,the House quite as long as others have that,44
NA,on more than one occasion I have brought,44
NA,to the notice of this chamber the opinion,44
NA,"of a small minority, if I could put it that",44
NA,"way, of growers who do not necessarily",44
NA,conform to the viewpoint of the Australian,44
NA,Dried Fruits Association.,44
NA,I imagine that my friend the honourable,44
NA,"member for Darling ( Mr FitzPatrick), who",44
NA,"spoke earlier in the debate, probably did",44
NA,not mean to suggest that there are no,44
NA,grower's representatives on the research,44
NA,committee.,44
NA,Mr FitzPatrick-Direc t representation.,44
Mr GILES,H e now says 'direct rep-,44
NA,resentation'. I think if he studies clause 11,44
NA,of the Dried Fruits Research Bill he will,44
NA,find that the membership of the Committee,44
NA,includes 4 persons to represent the organiscall,44
NA,ation known as the Australian Dried Fruits,44
NA,"Association. As I understand the position,",44
NA,that is direct representation by growers.,44
NA,far as I am aware there are no members,44
NA,the Australian Dried Fruits Association,44
NA,who are not growers. If I heard the,44
NA,"ourable member correctly, he said tnat",44
NA,there was not enough grower represen-,44
NA,tation on the Committee. In my view,44
NA,there is ample grower representation,44
NA,on a committee primarily geared to,44
NA,the job of rationalising research projects.,44
NA,This is not the sort of committee where,44
NA,one would necessarily expect a majority of,44
NA,"grower representatives. As I see it, it is a",44
NA,committee on which appointees from the,44
NA,Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial,44
NA,"Research Organisation, the Department of",44
NA,Primary Industry and the Australian Agri-,44
NA,cultural Council logically should have,44
NA,more knowledge with which to advise the,44
NA,industry on research projects. I think there,44
NA,is a reasonably generous complement of,44
NA,growers representatives on the committee,44
NA,by virtue of clause 11 (1.) (a) which states:,44
NA,four persons to represent the organisauon known,44
NA,as thc Australian Dried Fruits Association;,44
NA,The honourable member for Riverina ( Mr,44
NA,Grassby) did mention that he feit it wns,44
NA,hard to have a policy until we knew,44
NA,whether tbe United Kingdom was goinj> to,44
NA,join the European Common' Market or,44
NA,not. I do not argue very much with the,44
NA,honourable member for Riverinj in rela-,44
NA,tion to this. Obviously . whether Britain,44
NA,joins the Common Market or not will,44
NA,determine the way future policies will have,44
NA,"to go, and if he thinks verbosity or verbal",44
NA,diarrhoea is a substitute for policy in rela-,44
NA,"tion to these matters, I cannot help that.",44
NA,Anyone with an ounce o'f commonsense,44
NA,would surely agree that until'we know the,44
NA,exact marketing conditions to apply to this,44
NA,industry in the future we cannot very well,44
NA,have a certain policy. The policy' might be,44
NA,"to produce more or to produce less, or",44
NA,"perhaps to stabilise the industry, hut until",44
NA,we know the direction in which production,44
NA,is going I submit that only an ass wou'd,44
NA,consider it of any importance at all to he,44
NA,"more specific than that. However, it is up",44
NA,to the honourable member for Riverina to,44
NA,make up his own mind. .,44
NA,The most important thing about the,44
NA,dried fruit industry in my electorate i.s that,44
NA,over many years it has been what I might,44
NA,the basic common denominator or the,44
NA,fall-back industry of the area. The canned,44
NA,"fruit, citrus and wine industries have their",44
NA,As peaks of profitability to' growers on,44
NA,"of irrigated properties in those' areas, but",44
NA,fundamentally it is the dried fruits industry,44
NA,honon which they can fall back when times,44
NA,are not so good in the other industries that,45
NA,"1 mentioned, it is on the basis of this his-",45
NA,torical fact that this legislation is of great,45
NA,"importance to my area, we are now faced",45
NA,with a situation in my electorate in which,45
NA,predominantly citrus growing farms are,45
NA,very often not proving profitable. We are,45
NA,also faced with a situation in which certain,45
NA,sections of the canned fruit industry,45
NA,around Berri and Renmark have had their,45
NA,"difficulties, particularly with",45
NA,"peaches, much more, I think, than growers",45
NA,"in any other part of Australia, due to",45
NA,peculiarities of production patterns in,45
NA,which peaches from that area form a pre-,45
NA,dominant part of tolal production. This,45
NA,pattern is not mirrored in other areas of,45
NA,Auslralia. So we therefore have a situation,45
NA,"in which, with problems of surplus produc-",45
NA,tion facing the wine industry within the,45
NA,"next 5 years if not sooner, the producers",45
NA,will once again want to know where they,45
NA,stand in relation to the dried fruits,45
NA,industry.,45
NA,It is for that very purpose that the,45
NA,duction of a stabilisation scheme to come,45
NA,foi ward shortly is a matter of grave con-,45
NA,cern to growers of gordo and sultana,45
NA,grapes in particular in that locality. So,45
NA,not purely a matter of a policy in relation,45
NA,to dried fruits. There is an automatic inter-,45
NA,"weaving of different products, affecting the",45
NA,"entire economy of those areas, as in the",45
NA,diversity of uses for grapes in both the wine,45
NA,and dried fruit industries. It is important,45
NA,that all possible efforts be made to conduct,45
NA,proper research into alternate uses and,45
NA,functions for sultana and gordo grapes,45
NA,produced in those areas. Very often this,45
NA,type of research does not hold the answer,45
NA,to the marketing or merchandising of these,45
NA,"products. I think, for instance, of years",45
NA,gone by when the average production of,45
NA,sultanas on an irrigated farm was perhaps,45
NA,10 tons to the acre. It is entirely due to,45
NA,this type of research that there are varities,45
NA,of sultana grapes available today which,45
NA,produce 20 tons to the acre. I quote this as,45
NA,an example where we are not necessarily,45
NA,solving marketing difficulties through,45
NA,"research, but research is making it possible",45
NA,for individual farmers on irrigated proper-,45
NA,ties to make some gains in productivity,45
NA,within their enterprise.,45
NA,I appreciate that the Opposition views,45
NA,the word 'productivity' with complete,45
NA,ror and a lack of understanding but I,45
NA,assure them that people struggling to keep,45
NA,their heads above the debt structures in,45
NA,industries such as thc dried fruit industry,45
NA,"do not see it in that light. Productivity,",45
NA,whether it be related to the poorer sectors,45
NA,of primary industry such as small dairy,45
NA,farmers and dried fruit producers or other,45
NA,"more profitable industries, is a matter of",45
NA,great concern and the Government,45
NA,deserves great commendation for introduc-,45
NA,canned ing or formalising-i f I could put it that,45
NA,way-industr y investment on the one hand,45
NA,and Government matching grants for,45
NA,research on the other in a search for pro-,45
NA,"ductivity, for new marketing methods and",45
NA,a higher quality of dried fruit produced.,45
NA,Many honourable members have toured,45
NA,areas such as South East Asia on behalf of,45
NA,their electorates for the purpose of assist-,45
NA,ing businesses and industries within their,45
NA,electorates. 1 expect that many of them,45
NA,"will have run into, as I have in the past in",45
NA,"countries such as Japan, the Australian",45
NA,Trade Commissioner who has said 'Come,45
NA,introalong with me and try a sample of an,45
NA,Australian product'. This happened to me,45
NA,many years ago and it may be that the,45
NA,position has now been remedied. The,45
NA,it is Trade Commissioner might say 'Try this,45
NA,piece of dried fruit' and you sample it but,45
NA,you find some grit in it.. For some quaint,45
NA,reason not only Australians but also the,45
NA,Japanese seem to think that grit has an,45
NA,association with dirt.. Being a race with,45
NA,very hygienic attitudes the Japanese do not,45
NA,like the association of a gritty taste in the,45
NA,mouth with dirt. When the fruit is con-,45
NA,tracting in the drying stages on racks it is,45
NA,difficult to exclude grit that might be in,45
NA,"the air, but its presence can have an",45
NA,adverse effect on a small bu! important,45
NA,export industry.,45
NA,"I believe that in the progressive areas,",45
NA,such as those represented by tbe honour-,45
NA,"able member for Mallee, the drying of sul-",45
NA,tanas and other grapes is now being done,45
NA,on vine. This is a breakthrough. The process,45
NA,involves cincturing the bark on the rods of,45
NA,"sultanas or whatever variety is being treated,",45
NA,thereby stopping the flow of sap therein,45
NA,and drying the product on the vine. By,45
NA,"this process there is a fair chance, through",45
NA,eliminating triple handling and rack drying,45
NA,that airborne earth particles will not attach,45
NA,to the dried fruit. I believe the quality of,45
NA,horthe fruit produced in this way is of an,45
NA,can exceptionally high order. Any industry,45
NA,worth its salt will look at change and,46
NA,vation. It needs this type of research.,46
NA,the dried fruits industry is,46
NA,"position as a most dependable industry, as",46
NA,"it traditionally has been in irrigated areas,",46
NA,this type of research must take pride,46
NA,place. The growers themselves must,46
NA,to profit by the type of research and,46
NA,results when they are announced.,46
NA,1 think 1 need say no more at the,46
NA,ond reading stage of these associated Bills.,46
NA,I look forward to seeing what amendments,46
NA,arc moved during the Committee stage,46
NA,the Bills. I hope that when they are moved,46
NA,by honourable members on either side,46
NA,the House they will bear directly towards,46
NA,the betterment of an industry in which the,46
NA,people involved are struggling to make,46
NA,their way in life and in many cases to,46
NA,off their commitments. I commend fhe,46
NA,Government very heartily for working with,46
NA,the industry and in bringing in the type,46
NA,research that will not penalise or interfere,46
NA,with research that has been contributed,46
NA,"by both sides in the past. In other words,",46
NA,this research is in addition to any research,46
NA,which has previously been carried out I,46
NA,support the Bill.,46
Mr SINCLAIR ,New England-Ministe r,46
NA,for Primary Industry) (5.34)-Severa l mat-,46
NA,ters were raised during the course of this,46
NA,debate about which I would like to compart,46
NA,"ment briefly. First of all, significant",46
NA,ence was made by the honourable member,46
NA,for Dawson (Dr Patterson) to the fact that,46
NA,in the view of tbe Opposition there should,46
NA,be an organisation of primary industry,46
NA,relation lo realistic markets. Whilst one,46
NA,can on the surface see that here is perhaps,46
NA,a realistic approach I think that one must,46
NA,look below the surface to see the spectre,46
NA,of arbitrary control applied by governfor,46
NA,ments. For my part 1 would be apprehenwithin,46
NA,sive that such a move might well ignore,46
NA,the prospects of the maintenance of normarketing,46
NA,mal production by those who own the,46
NA,"land, who work the land, who share farm",46
NA,the land and who traditionally take investof,46
NA,ment decisions. Whilst one must acknowlnear,46
NA,edge that at a time of market contraction,46
NA,and marketing difiiculties there is a very,46
NA,real need for research in the terms of this,46
NA,Biil and for marketing exploration and,46
NA,"development, both in terms of the prosthe",46
NA,"pects abroad and within Australia, I think",46
NA,one must still ensure that there is a preserthrough,46
NA,vation of the role and capacity of the stantial,46
NA,11804/71-Jt-144 ],46
NA,"innoproducer himself. It is, of course, towards",46
NA,If that end and in that connotation that this,46
NA,to maintain its Bill has been framed.,46
NA,Several specific matters have been,46
NA,of referred to by a number of honourable,46
NA,learn members. The honourable meniber for,46
NA,the Dawson suggested the inclusion of dried,46
NA,apples in this research and he said that,46
NA,whilst it was a small industry there would,46
NA,secseem to be some advantage in research,46
NA,being pursued with regard to dried apples,46
NA,as well as to all the other dried varieties of,46
NA,of fruit included in this Bill. 1 am advised,46
NA,that the proposals originated with the Aus-,46
NA,of tralian Dried Fruits Association and the,46
NA,specific varieties that are included in the,46
NA,Bill result from that Association's submis-,46
NA,sion and from discussions within the Aus-,46
NA,pay tralian Agricultural Council. I can assure,46
NA,the honourable member that if the pro-,46
NA,ducers of dried apples were to make a sub-,46
NA,of mission to the Government it would be,46
NA,considered in the same light as submissions,46
NA,to now included in the Bill were considered.,46
NA,Should there be some basis on which the,46
NA,dried apple industry should be included,46
NA,either in this or in similar legislation the,46
NA,representations would of course be taken,46
NA,into account.,46
NA,Several suggestions were made during,46
NA,the course of this debate that this is only a,46
NA,of the total problem of the dried vine,46
NA,referfruits industry. I completely concur with,46
NA,that statement. In fact very real problems,46
NA,"are emerging, both this year in relation to",46
NA,what has been an unexpectedly poor crop,46
NA,in and in the future in relation to market,46
NA,contraction. It is true that 12 months ago,46
NA,in April 1970 the industry unfortunately,46
NA,did not support a stabilisation scheme sub-,46
NA,mitted to it. As the honourable member,46
NA,"Dawson said, 2 factions emerged",46
NA,the industry and the result was that,46
NA,unfortunately the indu.stry suffered with,46
NA,difficulties last year and this,46
NA,"year from a marked contraction, in thc",46
NA,crop so that the general economic position,46
NA,the dried fruits producers is nowhere,46
NA,as viable as one would like it to be.,46
NA,The honourable member for Mallee ( Mr,46
NA,Turnbull) wanted to know what the indus-,46
NA,try lost by not accepting that scheme. It,46
NA,might be possible to put some figure on,46
NA,loss that was incurred but I think it is,46
NA,suffice to say that if the scheme had gone,46
NA,there would have been a very sub-,46
NA,payout to the industry in respect of,46
NA,last year's crop. I would prefer not to quan-,47
NA,tify it other than to say that under the,47
NA,terms of the proposal which was rejected,47
NA,"by the industry, without doubt the money",47
NA,that would have been paid to the pro-,47
NA,ducers would have given them very real,47
NA,assistance in their present difficulties.,47
NA,Negotiations have been continuing in the,47
NA,last month or 6 weeks between officers of,47
NA,"the Department of Primary Industry, exec-",47
NA,utive officers and elected officers of the,47
NA,ADFA and me. As late as yesterday we,47
NA,moved quite well along the way towards,47
NA,settling the details of a new proposition,47
NA,which I hope will be submitted as a pack-,47
NA,age deal to growers. I trust that we will be,47
NA,in a position to do this fairly shortly. This,47
NA,new scheme has some modifications of the,47
NA,previous proposal which was placed before,47
NA,the Government. This scheme has emerged,47
NA,largely as a result of discussions between,47
NA,the producer representatives and me. When,47
NA,we are in a position to submit a firm pro-,47
NA,posal it will be done as a total package,47
NA,"deal. As I said, I hope that this will be",47
NA,fairly soon. When the new scheme in detail,47
NA,is available to producers I trust that this,47
NA,time they will give it their full support,47
NA,because there is no doubt that their unfor-,47
NA,tunate rejection of the last scheme has cer-,47
NA,tainly prejudiced their present financial,47
NA,position.,47
NA,The honourable member for Darling,47
NA,( Mr FitzPatrick) referred to 2 specific mat-,47
NA,ters. I did not quite follow the point that,47
NA,he made regarding representation of pro-,47
NA,ducers. Clause 11 (l.)(a) of the Dried,47
NA,Fruits Research Bill 1971 provides that the,47
NA,Research Committee shall include 4 per-,47
NA,sons representing an organisation known as,47
NA,the Australian Dried Fruits Association,47
NA,and clause ll(l.)(b) provides that 2 per-,47
NA,sons will represent the packers of dried,47
NA,fruits. There is in fact no packers organisathe levy.,47
NA,tion. Those 2 representatives will be,47
NA,nominated by the ADFA. The ADFA is,47
NA,specifically a producers' organisation. The,47
NA,members of that organisation consist,47
NA,entirely of elected representatives of pro-,47
NA,ducers and they will control 6 out of the,47
NA,11 members on the Committee who will,47
NA,determine the allocation of research pro-,47
NA,jects. I am sure that when the honourable,47
NA,member for Darling looks at the detail of,47
NA,this Bill he will see that his concern about,47
NA,lack of producer representation will be,47
NA,alleviated.,47
NA,"Indeed, on the Dried Fruits Research",47
NA,Committee will be other persons represent-,47
NA,ing government in one form or another.,47
NA,There will be 3 persons to represent the,47
NA,"Australian Agricultural Council, one per-",47
NA,son to represent the Commonwealth,47
NA,Scientific and Industrial Research Organis-,47
NA,ation and one person to represent the,47
NA,Commonwealth Department of Primary,47
NA,Industry. So there is no provision for rep-,47
NA,resentation other than by those persons,47
NA,representing government and those repre-,47
NA,senting producers. In that sense I believe,47
NA,that the Dried Fruits Research Committee,47
NA,is truly reflective of the wishes and the,47
NA,requirements of producers themselves.,47
NA,The other question which the honour-,47
NA,able member for Darling raised refers to a,47
NA,matter contained in clause 5 of the Dried,47
NA,Fruits Levy Collection Bill. Specifically he,47
NA,expressed concern that growers would have,47
NA,only 2 months in which to pay the levy as,47
NA,set out in clause 5 (1.). The position as I,47
NA,understand it-an d I believe that this,47
NA,applies to nearly all districts-i s that in,47
NA,most seasons delivery is completed by the,47
NA,"end of May or, at the latest, in June and",47
NA,consequently there will be a considerable,47
NA,period between the time when delivery is,47
NA,completed and 30th November when the,47
NA,payment of the levy is required. If grapes,47
NA,"should be delivered after 30th September,",47
NA,"of course, payment of the levy would not",47
NA,be required until 30th November of the,47
NA,"following year. So growers, instead of",47
NA,"having 2 months in which to pay the levy,",47
NA,in fact will have a very considerable period,47
NA,in which to pay it. I am told that most,47
NA,pickings commence at some time in Febru-,47
NA,"ary, and this year, because of the very",47
NA,"small size of the crop, they have already",47
NA,"been completed. Consequently, growers",47
NA,have between now and 30th November- a,47
NA,period of some 8 months-i n which to pay,47
NA,I believe that the other matters which,47
NA,have been raised relate more to the mar-,47
NA,keting side of the industry. I agree that,47
NA,they are of great significance to the indus-,47
NA,try. I believe that the industry is passing,47
NA,through a period of some uncertainty,47
NA,which has been caused by the virtual col-,47
NA,lapse of the International Sultana Agree-,47
NA,ment. But I assure honourable members,47
NA,that the suggestion that nothing is being,47
NA,done to produce an alternative policy in,47
NA,the event of Britain entering into the Euro-,47
NA,pean Economic Community is incorrect,47
NA,and that exactly the contrary is the case.,48
NA,"In fact, the Government's firm intention",48
NA,and its actions have been aimed at 2 areas.,48
NA,The first is the development of new mar-,48
NA,"kets, and a great deal of activity, both",48
NA,"direct and indirect, has taken place in this",48
NA,"regard, and the second is the negotiation",48
NA,of international commodity agreements.,48
NA,One hopes that the International Sultana,48
NA,Agreement can be replaced in some form,48
NA,because it has served the industry well. It,48
NA,has provided a reliable and stable price,48
NA,over a considerable period. I believe that,48
NA,this has been very much to the advantage,48
NA,"of Greece, Turkey and Australia, which",48
NA,are the 3 principal producing countries and,48
NA,"which, of course, are members of the",48
NA,International Sultana Agreement. Some,48
NA,peculiar problems have arisen from Tur-,48
NA,key's devaluation of its currency. These,48
NA,problems have been mentioned not in the,48
NA,debate this afternoon but to me on other,48
NA,occasions. I can recognise the industry's,48
NA,"concern about its future, but I believe that",48
NA,the positive steps which have been taken,48
NA,by the Govemment in searching for over-,48
NA,seas markets will be in the long term of,48
NA,real assistance to the industry.,48
NA,"Of course, within Australia I think there",48
NA,is a necessity for the continued promotion,48
NA,and encouragement of the use of dried,48
NA,fruits. I was surprised to hear that,48
NA,apparently there has been a slight reduc-,48
NA,tion in the sale of dried fruits across the,48
NA,grocery counter and that the only increase,48
NA,in the domestic demand for dried fruits,48
NA,has been for manufacturing purposes.,48
NA,Thanks to the efforts of the honourable,48
NA,"member for Mallee, honourable members",48
NA,have been able lo sample dried fruits in,48
NA,their dining room for many years. I believe,48
NA,that if more Australians were given the,48
NA,opportunity to eat dried fruits the domestic,48
NA,demand for them across the grocery,48
NA,counter might similarly increase. I com-,48

NA,The Bill gives effect to the announcement,48
NA,made by the Prime Minister ( Mr,48
NA,MCMahon) on 15th March that an imme-,48
NA,diate increase would be granted in pensions,48
NA,"now being paid at maximum rates, with",48
NA,similar increases for certain other benefits.,48
NA,The increase of 50c a week in the basic,48
NA,"standard rate payable to age, invalid and",48
NA,widow pensioners will bring the new rate,48
NA,"to $16 a week-this , of course, excludes",48
NA,to the pension such as supple-,48
NA,mentary assistance and additional pay-,48
NA,ments for children. The increase of $1 a,48
NA,week for married couples will bring their,48
NA,combined basic rate to $28.50 a week. The,48
NA,maximum basic rate for widows without,48
NA,a children will rise to $14.25 a week. The,48
NA,full increase of 50c will be payable to all,48
NA,pensioners who are now receiving the max-,49
NA,"imum rate-tha t is, those whose means as",49
NA,assessed are not more than $10 a week in,49
NA,the case of unmarried persons or $17 a,49
NA,week for married couples. A proportion of,49
NA,the 50c increase will be payable to unmar-,49
NA,ried pensioners whose means as assessed,49
NA,fall between $10 a week and $11 a week,49
NA,and to married pensioners where the com-,49
NA,bined means as assessed of husband and,49
NA,wife are between $17 a week and $19 a,49
NA,week. The provisions to pay portion of the,49
NA,50c increase to these pensioners will ensure,49
NA,that their total income is not less than that,49
NA,of maximum rate pensioners with full,49
NA,allowable means. Similar increases will,49
NA,apply to sheltered employment and rehabil-,49
NA,itation allowances. Long-term sickness,49
NA,benefits will also be increased by 50c a,49
NA,"week, bringing the maximum rate to $16 a",49
NA,week for single adults and married minors,49
NA,or to $10.50 a week for other persons.,49
NA,These rates apply after a person has been,49
NA,in receipt of sickness benefit for a continu-,49
NA,ous period of 6 weeks. Additional amounts,49
NA,"payable for dependants will, where applica-",49

NA,"The real level of the pension-tha t is, its",50
NA,purchasing power in terms of goods and,50
NA,services-i s usually set at budget time at a,50
NA,"level which, in terms of real purchasing",50
NA,"power, generally, though not invariably,",50
NA,gives pensioners an increase. Last Budget,50
NA,the increase in money rates just about,50
NA,"covered the increase in prices, so that the",50
NA,pensioner's position was held static. Since,50
NA,that time there has been a rise of about,50
NA,2.5 per cent in the consumer price index.,50
NA,The present proposed increases in the pen-,51
NA,sion rate are substantially greater than,51
NA,this-namel y 3.2 per cent in the single rate,51
NA,and 3.6 per cent in the married rate. These,51
NA,should be contrasted with the 2.5 per cent,51
NA,rise in the consumer price index; they indi-,51
NA,cate the rise in the real value of the pension.,51
NA,It is true that the December quarter,51
NA,"price rise was 1.9 per cent, which was out",51
NA,of line with previous experience. The,51
NA,"March quarter figure is not, of course, yet",51
NA,"available, and it would be wrong to pretend",51
NA,"to any accuracy in forecasting it, but",51
NA,"preliminary indications, for what they are",51
NA,"worth, suggest that the rise will be less",51
NA,than that for the December quarter. Never-,51
NA,theless the price rise which has already,51
NA,taken place gives grounds for the present,51
NA,"extra-budget rise in the basic pension rate,",51
NA,and one hopes that future price rises will,51
NA,slow down. The Prime Minister has,51
NA,already described the present pension,51
NA,"increase as an interim measure, and it",51
NA,would be agreeable indeed- I hope that,51
NA,honourable members would find it agree-,51
NA,able-i f the rise in money rate which he,51
NA,has forecast for the next budget were to be,51
NA,substantially a rise in the real rate of,51
NA,sion-tha t is a rise which would not be,51
NA,significantly eroded by subsequent price,51
NA,increases.,51
NA,Price increases occur through excess,51
NA,"demand, which makes possible sales at an",51
NA,increased price. Behind this process there,51
NA,"are 2 engines, a big engine and a small",51
NA,one. The small engine is the tendency of,51
NA,certain business men to increase their,51
NA,"profit margin-tha t is, to increase their",51
NA,prices faster than their costs. The big,51
NA,engine is the tendency of workers to,51
NA,"demand over-award payments, beyond the",51
NA,increase in net productivity. This increases House.,51
NA,"costs, and leads to massive price rises with-",51
NA,out any profit increase. The reason,51
NA,the extra profit margin must be considered,51
NA,"the 'small' engine, and over-award pay-",51
NA,ments the 'big' engine is purely one of,51
NA,figures; as a component of total prices,51
NA,much the more substantial. I am distributmaking,51
NA,ing to honourable members herewith- I him to withdraw it.,51
NA,am sorry that it is not possible for prac-,51
NA,tical reasons to incorporate it in Han-,51
NA,sard- a graph showing the relationship,51
NA,between award wages and average earnings,51
NA,over recent years. The diverging distance,51
NA,between the 2 lines on this graph largely,51
NA,"represents over-award payments. I would, the House. .",51
NA,"of course, be the last person to suggest",51
NA,that real wages should not rise. As produc-,51
NA,"tivity increases, real wages have risen, and",51
NA,this process should be encouraged to con-,51
NA,tinue. Provided money wages rise in step,51
NA,with productivity the price level can still,51
NA,be held-i t is where the rise in money,51
NA,wages oversteps the rise in productivity,51
NA,that the trouble starts. Would it be too,51
NA,much to suggest that the rises in real,51
NA,wages awarded by the Arbitration Court,51
NA,are more responsibly based than the system,51
NA,of ad hoc over-award payments?,51
NA,Mr Kennedy-Th e Minister is supposed,51
NA,to be in charge of the Department of Social,51

NA,Order! The honourable member will re-,51

Mr WENTWORTH, I realise entirely,51
NA,the sensitivity of Opposition members in,51
NA,this matter. I know that they have been,51
NA,peddling false doctrines and trying to de-,51
NA,pen- ceive the Australian people and they are,51
NA,not happy at being exposed. I realise en-,51
NA,tirely the motives behind the interjections,51
NA,of the Opposition. I know that certain,51
NA,trade union leaders have gone on record,51
NA,saying that if wages are controlled by the,51
NA,Court then prices should be controlled by,51
NA,law. I venture to suggest that these trade,51
NA,union spokesmen have not thought out,51
NA,their position.,51
Mr HAYDEN , 1 rise on a point of order.,51
NA,This has reached the stage where it is a,51
NA,little hard to bear. We all indulge the,51

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! That,51
NA,why is a personal reflection.,51
Mr HAYDEN , I raise the point-,51
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! The,51
NA,it is honourable member is out of order in,51
NA,a personal reflection. I would ask,51
Mr HAYDEN ,Wha t is the personal,51
NA,reflection?,51
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Th e honour-,51
NA,able member is not in order in making a,51
NA,personal reflection on another member of,51
Mr HAYDEN ," I am sorry, I thought 1",52
NA,was being descriptive in the literary sense.,52
NA,I will withdraw it if it is offensive.,52
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER, I asked the,52
NA,honourable niember to withdraw it because,52
NA,it is a personal reflection.,52
Mr WENTWORTH, I realise the,52
NA,motives of the honourable member for,52
NA,Oxley. The little man is obviously,52
NA,distressed.,52
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order !,52
Mr WENTWORTH,H e is trying to,52
NA,prevent the truth,52
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! 1 call,52
NA,the honourable member for Oxley on a,52
NA,point of order.,52
Mr HAYDEN ,I f the Minister will sit,52
NA,down and behave himself in uncharacteristic,52
NA,style I will make the point with you,52
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order !,52
Mr HAYDEN ,"Oh , I am sorry. I did not",52
NA,realise that one should be more tolerant.,52
NA,The point I wanl lo raise with you is,52
NA,whether you would be good enough to rule,52
NA,on the terminology of this Bill. I rather,52
NA,doubt whether the Minister has the brief,52
NA,to rampage as widely as he is,52
NA,present time.,52
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! That while I am in the chair.,52
NA,is a matter for the Chair to decide.,52
Mr HAYDEN ,"Well , I think the Chair",52
NA,ought to look at it and I have asked,52
NA,Chair to do so.,52
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! It Minister,52
NA,has. I call the Minister for Social Services.,52
Mr HAYDEN ,"O n the point of order,",52
NA,have asked the Chair to look at the,52
NA,and to decide,52
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! I rule should be withdrawn.,52
NA,that the Minister is in order and I have,52
NA,called the Minister for Social Services.,52
Mr WENTWORTH, I realises,52
Mr HAYDEN , I have raised a point,52
NA,order in regard to this silly trivia that,52
NA,Minister is putting before the House. We,52
NA,have before us a Bill for an Act to amend,52
NA,the Social Services Act 1947-1970 in cersition,52
NA,tain respects. As you have ruled that,52
NA,in order for the Minister to discourse over,52
NA,"the area of industrial relations, I ask",52
NA,to indicate to me which sections of this,52
NA,Bill relate to industrial relations.,52
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! It is,52
NA,not necessary for the Chair to explain the,52
NA,reasons for ruling the Minister in order. I,52
NA,rule that the Minister is in order. I call the,52
NA,Minister for Social Services.,52
Mr FOSTER , I rise on a point of order.,52
NA,My point of order is this: Is it right for,52
NA,the Minister at the table to insult the pen-,52
NA,sioners and at the same time to insult,52
NA,members of this House?,52
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! The,52
NA,honourable member is being frivolous. I,52
NA,warn him not to waste the time of the,52
NA,House with frivolous points of order.,52
Mr WENTWORTH, I realise fully the,52
NA,desperate straits that the Opposition is in,52
NA,in its endeavour to cover up the truth. It,52
NA,does not want these things discussed. It,52
NA,knows that it itself is guilty in endeavour-,52
NA,ing to affect the inflation. It is therefore,52
NA,raising these trivial and unworthy points of,52
NA,order.,52
Mr BRYANT ," Mr Deputy Speaker, in",52
NA,"bowing to your ruling, can we receive an",52
NA,assurance from the chair that in the subse-,52
NA,quent debate no restriction whatsoever will,52
NA,be placed upon speakers from the Opposi-,52
NA,doing at the tion side of the House?,52
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER, I can,52
NA,account only for what I do in the chair,52
NA,Mr Daly- I rise on a point of order. A,52
NA,few moments ago you asked the honour-,52
NA,the able member for Oxley to withdraw cer-,52
NA,tain statements he made in reference to the,52
NA,for Social Services. In the circum-,52
NA,stances is it right for the Minister in the,52
NA,guise of making a second reading speech to,52
NA,I make a bitter personal attack on every,52
NA,Bill member on tbe Opposition side of the,52
NA,"House? If not, I think that these remarks",52
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Ther e is no,52
NA,validity in the point of order. The honour-,52
NA,able member for Grayndler has been in,52
NA,of the House for many years and he knows,52
NA,the quite well that he is being facetious.,52
Mr WENTWORTH, I think it should,52
NA,be apparent even to members of the Oppo-,52
NA,that the rise in prices is of particular,52
NA,"it is importance to pensioners. Indeed, the",52
NA,reason for this Bill is the rise in prices.,52
NA,you Therefore I am entirely in order in dis-,52
NA,cussing this matter now. I know that cer-,52
NA,tain trade union leaders have gone on,52
NA,record saying: 'If wages are controlled by,53
NA,"the Court, then prices should be controlled",53
NA,by law'. I venture to suggest that these,53
NA,trade union spokesmen have not thought,53
NA,out their position. The Court does not pre-,53
NA,scribe a maximum wage-i t prescribes a,53
NA,minimum wage. Over-award payments are,53
NA,"perfectly legal, and, indeed even though",53
NA,they may sometimes be morbidly devel-,53
NA,"oped, on other occasions, when they are",53
NA,"matched by increased productivity, these",53
NA,over-award payments may be eminently,53
NA,desirable. But trade union spokesmen do,53
NA,not want to declare a minimum price-in -,53
NA,"deed, and in this they are following the",53
NA,line originally laid down by the Liberal-,53
NA,"Country Party Government, they have set",53
NA,their face against these minimum prices.,53
NA,But they want to declare a maximum,53
NA,"price. These trade union spokesmen, who",53
NA,want to compare the treatments of wages,53
NA,"and prices, apparently have not realised",53
NA,the difference between a maximum and a,53
NA,"minimum, and have consequently got",53
NA,themselves into a state of utter confusion.,53
NA,"Let me repeat that, as the Prime Minis-",53
NA,"ter has said, the present pension rise is an",53
NA,interim rise only. In saying that it lifts,53
NA,"pension to a record level, not merely in",53
NA,money terms but in terms also of real,53
NA,"purchasing power, I do not mean that the",53
NA,Government regards this as an ultimate,53
NA,"goal. As productivity rises, so also should",53
NA,pensions. One other point is of major,53
NA,importance. Pension rates are not the only,53
NA,assistance which is vital to the pensioner.,53
NA,"Housing, nursing services and home help-",53
NA,and indeed many of the fringe benefits,53
NA,most of which have been introduced by,53
NA,governments on our side of politics-ar e,53
NA,all vital. In the course of the present,53
NA,liament I believe it will be possible to,53
NA,improve them still further. The Prime,53
NA,Minister has spoken of the 'fundamental,53
NA,review of social services' which is now in,53
NA,process. This is too large a matter to be,53
NA,"dealt with here, where the time for debate",53
NA,before this Bill should be passed is so,53
NA,short. I hope before long to be able to,53
NA,bring before Cabinet the results of the,53
NA,review to which the Prime Minister has,53
NA,referred. I trust that the House will permit,53
NA,me to refer to this in passing rather than,53
NA,to anticipate any details. The Prime Minister down?,53
NA,ter also referred to consideration being,53
NA,given to 'method of adjusting' our benefits,53
NA,in the future. This matter also is under,53
NA,"review, and, once again, I hope that",53
NA,Cabinet will be considering it before too,53
NA,long.,53
NA,Honourable members will note the com-,53
NA,plexity of the Bill. This stems from the,53
NA,fact that it is being incorporated in existing,53
NA,legislation which has from time to time,53
NA,been changed and become more complex,53
NA,with the changes. Some time ago I,53
NA,indicated to the House that I was hoping,53
NA,to have the whole Act codified and rewrit-,53
NA,ten in a simpler form. This matter has,53
NA,been referred to the Parliamentary Counsel,53
NA,but pressure of business has so far pre-,53
NA,vented it from being undertaken. Perhaps,53
NA,it may now be considered in conjunction,53
NA,with the fundamental review of the social,53
NA,services structure to which the Prime,53
NA,Minister has already referred. The Govern-,53
NA,ment has decided that the increase in all,53
NA,pension rates will apply in respect of all,53
NA,pension payments made after 31st March.,53
NA,There is a repatriation pension pay day on,53
NA,"1st April, age and invalid pension on 8th",53
NA,"April, and widow's pension on 13th April.",53
NA,The rate of Service pensions-whic h are,53
NA,paid under the Repatriation Act-depend s,53
NA,the upon the rates set in the Social Services,53
NA,Act.,53
NA,It is thus essential that the whole of the,53
NA,legislation should operate as from 1st,53
NA,April. Honourable members will note that,53
NA,"clause 2 of the Bill provides for this, even",53
NA,though the legislation may not receive the,53
NA,Governor-General's assent by that date.,53
NA,"Originally we thought that, following upon",53
NA,a public statement made some time ago by,53
NA,"the Leader of the Opposition, the Bills",53
NA,would receive a speedy passage. We now,53
NA,Par- understand that the Opposition desires to,53
NA,"debate them, as is of course the Opposi-",53
NA,tion's right if it so chooses. No doubt hon-,53
NA,ourable members opposite desire to make a,53
NA,public show in order to rid themselves of,53
NA,the odium which must hang round them in,53
NA,view of the equivocal attitude adopted by,53
NA,their Leader in regard to the previous,53
NA,statements which he made on the 'feather,53
NA,bedding of pensioners',53
Mr HAYDEN , I take a point of order.,53
NA,"Mr Deputy Speaker, will you sit the Minis-",53
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Drury)-,53
NA,Order! Is the honourable member taking a,53
NA,point of order?,53
Mr HAYDEN ,"Yes , indeed I am. This is",54
NA,a gross and wilful misrepresentation of the,54
NA,situation of the Leader cf the Opposition.,54
NA,"I draw your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker,",54
NA,to a statement made by the Leader of the,54
NA,Opposition in this House on 24th Febru-,54
NA,ary. I quote the Leader of the Opposition.,54
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! The,54
NA,honourable member is now debating the,54
NA,point of order.,54
Mr HAYDEN ,No . I am quoting to you,54
NA,evidence in support of the point that the,54
NA,Minister well knows that what he is saying,54
NA,is a misrepresentation of the Leader of the,54
NA,Opposition.,54
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! I,54
NA,bave no personal knowledge of such mis-,54
NA,representation,54
Mr HAYDEN , I am not going to allow,54
NA,the Minister to continue with this sort of,54
NA,misrepresentation. It is childish and it is,54
NA,trivial.,54
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! The,54
NA,honourable member is making comment.,54
NA,He is out of order.,54
Mr HAYDEN ," Mr Deputy Speaker, I had",54
NA,hoped that you would uphold the dignity,54
NA,of the House. I will have to move dissent,54
NA,"from your ruling, because I do not see",54
NA,why we should have to listen to the foolish,54
NA,sort of trivia which the Minister brings,54
NA,into this House and the slander of an hon-,54
NA,ourable member's character. But you seem,54
NA,"to tolerate it, Mr Deputy Speaker.",54
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! The,54
NA,honourable member for Oxley will resume,54
NA,his seat.,54
Dr PATTERSON , I take a point of order.,54
NA,"With due reference to your ruling, Mr",54
NA,"Deputy Speaker, in this House second",54
NA,reading speeches have always been of a,54
NA,standard commensurate with the quality of,54
NA,the Bill itself. I submit that the Minister,54
NA,blatantly misusing this House to put over,54
NA,the views which he wants to express. I,54
NA,"believe that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, have",54
NA,a right,54
Mr BRYANT , A duty.,54
Dr PATTERSON ,An d a duty to make the,54
NA,Minister conform to the standards of this,54
NA,House with respect to this Bill.,54
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! I,54
NA,have already ruled that it is within the,54
NA,ambit of the Minister's second reading,54
NA,speech to continue on the subject matter,54
NA,of the Bill.,54
Mr HAYDEN ,"I n that case, I regret it,",54
NA,because I have a very warm personal,54
NA,"regard for you, Mr Deputy Speaker, as",54
NA,"you know, but I am going to move dissent",54
NA,from your ruling. I will take the oppor-,54
NA,"tunity of indicating the reasons why, once",54
NA,I have fulfilled the normal requirements.,54
NA,Debate interrupted.,54
NA,OBJECTION TO RULING,54
Mr HAYDEN ,Oxley) (8.25)- I move:,54
NA,That the ruling be assented from.,54
Dr PATTERSON , I second the motion.,54
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Th e motion,54
NA,must be in writing.,54
NA,( Mr Hayden having submitted his,54
NA,motion in writing.),54
Mr HAYDEN, I understand that I have,54
NA,the opportunity to speak in support of the,54
NA,"motion. I regret having to do this because,",54
NA,"as you know, I have a great personal",54
NA,"regard for you, Mr Deputy Speaker. We",54
NA,both come from the same State and we,54
NA,have been in this Federal Parliament for,54
NA,"many years. You are a warm hearted,",54
NA,Christian and compassionate gentleman.,54
NA,Unfortunately you do not seem to have the,54
NA,sort of firm character that is necessary in a,54
NA,situation like this.,54
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! The,54
NA,honourable member is out of order in,54
NA,making a personal reflection on the Chair,54
NA,or on any other member of the House.,54
Mr HAYDEN, 1 am sorry that this,54
NA,should be so.,54
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! The,54
NA,honourable member wil! withdraw the,54
NA,reflection on the Chair.,54
Mr HAYDEN, I will withdraw any,54
NA,reflection on the Chair. I do not want to,54
NA,"take up much of your time, Mr Deputy",54
NA,Speaker. This is a pretty serious situation.,54
NA,is I have indicated to you-o r I have tried to,54
NA,indicate to you but you have curtailed it-,54
NA,an application of Standing Orders which is,54
NA,different from what I see in the book on,54
NA,Standing Orders provided on this side of,54
NA,the House. I have suspected for some time,54
NA,that there are 2 editions and that the one,54
NA,on the other side of the House is different,54
NA,from the one we have. The point I want to,54
NA,make is,54
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! The,54
NA,honourable member is clearly making a,54
NA,reflection on the Chair in suggesting that,54
NA,there are double standards.,54
Mr HAYDEN, I apologise. It is uninten-,55
NA,tional. The point I want to make is that order.,55
NA,we all know the Minister for Social Ser-,55
NA,vices and his cerebral problems. But,55
NA,allowing for those,55
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! That,55
NA,again is a reflection on the Minister. I ask,55
NA,the honourable member for Oxley to with-,55
NA,draw that personal reflection. I ask the,55
NA,House to come to order. A lot of time is,55
NA,being wasted. 1 ask the honourable memHouse,55
NA,ber to withdraw that personal reflection.,55
Mr HAYDEN,Whic h one Ls that?,55
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Th e last perorder,55
NA,sonal reflection that the honourable memhave,55
NA,ber has just made.,55
Mr HAYDEN,Tha t the Minister suffers,55
NA,"from a cerebral problem? Yes, indeed.",55
NA,am sorry about that. Are we going to have,55
NA,enshrined in the records of this,55
NA,statement of wilful dishonesty by the,55
NA,Minister? The Leader of the Opposition,55
NA,has denied the allegations made by the,55
NA,Minister for Social Services. The Minister,55
NA,wel! knows that it is dishonest to suggest,55
NA,that the LeadeT of the Opposition is,55
NA,responsible for the statement concerned.,55
NA,"Nonetheless, he will pursue it for the simpoint of order.",55
NA,ple reason that it is a clever little side,55
NA,"tracking device. For instance, it will take",55
NA,"pressure away from the Government, he",55
NA,hopes. I do not know how adequate or,55
NA,"effective it will be, but he hopes that it",55
NA,take pressure away from the Government,55
NA,of the publie censure which is directed,55
NA,"it. After all, it is only a matter",55
NA,weeks since the Minister was suggesting,55
NA,that it was incredible io piopose,55
NA,increase in pensions. Subsequently he said,55
NA,"on a television programme, on which I",55
NA,appeared with him-,55
NA,Mr Irwin- 1 take a point of order. The,55
NA,honourable member is not speaking to the order?,55
NA,point of order whatsoever. He is speaking,55
NA,about something that happened some,55
NA,weeks ago.,55
Mr HAYDEN,"No . It is indeed relevant,",55
NA,"because it indicates motives, and motives",55
NA,are always important in a certain pattern,55
NA,of behaviour. On that television prohe,55
NA,gramme the Minister for Social Services,55
NA,said rather ingenuously that the only,55
NA,reason the increase was provided was,55
NA,mark the accession to office of the Prime,55
NA,Minister.,55
NA,Mr Donald Cameron- I fake a point of,55
Mr HAYDEN,Human e considerations,55
NA,even of matters of social economic justice,55
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! I call,55
NA,the honourable member for Griffith.,55
NA,Mr Donald Cameron-I f the honourable,55
NA,member wil] resume his seat-than k you.,55
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! The,55
NA,will come to order. I call the hon-,55
NA,ourable member for Griffith on a point of,55
NA,order.,55
NA,Mr Donald Cameron-M y point of,55
NA,is that 5 members of the Opposition,55
NA,told me in private that the Leader of,55
NA,the Opposition did make the statement,55
NA,referred to. I believe that this debate,55
NA,I should not be used as an opportunity for,55
NA,the honourable member for Oxley to try to,55
NA,House a get his Leader out of it.,55
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Order ! This,55
NA,is not a point of order.,55
Mr SCHOLES , I take a point of order. A,55
NA,"few moments ago, Mr Deputy Speaker,",55
NA,you warned a member of the Opposition,55
NA,for making frivolous points of order. I,55
NA,take fhe point that that was a frivolous,55
Mr HAYDEN,Al l I want to say is that,55
NA,"the Minister can pursue this if he wishes,",55
NA,for all we care. He knows full well that he,55
NA,will is misrepresenting the situation by pursuing,55
NA,it in this way. He may have some devious,55
NA,"to purpose, which I think is fairly obvious to",55
NA,of a few all honourable members.,55
Mr WENTWORTH , 1 take a poini of order.,55
NA,an The honourable member for Oxley,55
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Ther e is no,55
NA,point of order before the Chair.,55
Mr WENTWORTH ,I. s there a motion of,55
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,No .,55
Mr HAYDEN ,Tha t is all finished.,55
Mr WENTWORTH ,I t seems somewhat,55
NA,strange to me that the honourable meniber,55
NA,"for Oxley has behaved as he was, because",55
NA,has in front of him the text of my,55
NA,"speech. Apparently he did not read it,",55
NA,or if he did read it he slurred over the,55
NA,"to next sentence. I had spoken, as the hon-",55
NA,"ourable member will recall, of the state-",55
NA,ment of the Leader of the Opposition in,55
NA,regard to the feather bedding of pen-,56
NA,sioners. The text of tbe speech which the,56
NA,honourable member has in front of him,56
NA,goes on as follows:,56
NA,statements which he has somewhat unconvincingly,56
NA,denied in the face of solid evidence to the con-,56
NA,trary adduced by honourable members of his own,56
NA,Party.,56
NA,Hansard will show that when this matter,56
NA,first arose in this House and the Leader of,56
NA,the Opposition denied that he had used,56
NA,"those words, I accepted his denial, because",56
NA,one does accept the word of an honourable,56
NA,member. Subsequently I was placed in an,56
NA,embarrassing position because in this,56
NA,House the honourable member for Short-,56
NA,land ( Mr Griffiths) said the opposite. He,56
NA,made a definite statement. When he made,56
NA,that statement 1 was placed in an embar-,56
NA,rassing position because I could not believe,56
NA,both honourable members. They were say-,56
NA,ing things which were directly contrary one,56
NA,"to the other, so I had to look at Hansard",56
NA,and try to weigh up the evidence and try,56
NA,to find where the truth was. I had hoped,56
NA,that it would be possible for me to have,56
NA,excused the Leader of the Opposition by,56
NA,assuming that he had had a lapse of mem-,56
NA,"ory or something like that, but he came",56
NA,into this House- I am looking only at the,56
NA,Hansard-an d he specifically denied,56
NA,this.,56
NA,I had to choose between these 2 honour-,56
NA,able members. Of course one would always,56
NA,try to accept the word of an honourable,56
NA,"member in this House, but when one has",56
NA,to choose between 2 honourable members,56
NA,both in the same Party one has to look at,56
NA,the probabilities. One tries to weigh the,56
NA,evidence. In weighing the evidence it seems,56
NA,to me that the positive statements of the,56
NA,honourable member for Shortland are of,56
NA,more consequence than the denial of the,56
NA,"Leader of the Opposition, and I come to",56
NA,this conclusion very largely because the,56
NA,Leader of the Opposition has made in this,56
NA,House a couple of statements which are,56
NA,obviously untrue. The first statement was,56
NA,that every member of his Caucus would,56
NA,support him in this matter.,56
Mr HAYDEN , I take a point of order.,56
NA,Can we get back to the Bill?,56
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Drury)-,56
NA,Order! The motion before the Chair is one,56
NA,of dissent from my ruling.,56
Mr HAYDEN , I have withdrawn that,56
NA,motion. 1 indicated that some time ago.,56
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Ha s leave,56
NA,been obtained for the withdrawal of the,56
NA,motion?,56
Mr HAYDEN ,Yes .,56
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER, I was not,56
NA,aware that it had been withdrawn. You,56
NA,had not asked for leave.,56
Mr WENTWORTH,Th e honourable,56
NA,member for Oxley has brought this on his,56
NA,own head. I did not want to examine the,56
NA,motives and the probabilities. I dislike try-,56
NA,ing to weigh the truthfulness of 2 members,56
NA,of the Opposition but it has been forced,56
NA,upon me by the honourable member for,56
NA,Oxley.,56
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! I,56
NA,must ask the House to come to order. I,56
NA,understand from the honourable member,56
NA,for Oxley that he has withdrawn his,56
NA,"motion, but he can withdraw it only by",56
NA,leave of the House. Is the House agreeable,56
NA,to the honourable member withdrawing the,56
NA,motion?,56
Mr WENTWORTH,Yes .,56

NA,Second Reading,56
Mr HOLTEN ,Indi-Ministe r for,56
NA,Repatriation) (8.34)- I move:,56
NA,That the Bill be now read a second time.,56
NA,The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to,56
NA,"the Government's proposals, announced by",56
NA,the Prime Minister ( Mr MCMahon) in this,56
NA,"House on 15th March, to increase the rate",57
NA,of certain repatriation war and service,57
NA,sions from the first pay day after 31st,57
NA,March 1971. The clients of the Repatria-,57
NA,tion Department will receive the increases,57
NA,as from Ist April 1971 even though royal,57
NA,assent may not be obtained by that date.,57
NA,Clause 2 of the Bill is so worded as to,57
NA,achieve the desired date of payment. It,57
NA,was originally hoped that the Bill would go,57
NA,through tbe House of Representatives,57
NA,"today and tbe Senate on Wednesday but,",57
NA,due to the Opposition's request for an,57
NA,"adjournment of the debate until tomorrow,",57
NA,this will not be achievable. Another obvi-,57
NA,ous reason that it will not be possible to,57
NA,receive royal assent by Ist April is that,57
NA,Parliament was not sitting last week. My,57
NA,"colleague, the Minister for Social Services",57
NA,"( Mr Wentworth), has outlined some other",57
NA,factors also involved. The Government,57
NA,wishes to make it clear that the retrospec-,57
NA,"tivity involved on this occasion, because",57
NA,"special circumstances, should not be taken",57
NA,"as a precedent for the future, particularly",57
NA,in view of the very small time period,57
NA,involved and because of the other factors,57
NA,mentioned.,57
NA,This Bill provides for higher war comincrease,57
NA,pensation payments by way of increases in sions.,57
NA,the rates of war pension for totally and,57
NA,permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen,57
NA,"and women and those who, because of the",57
NA,"severity of their war-caused disabilities,",57
NA,"receive payments equal to the TPI rate,",57
NA,"namely, the war blinded, those temporarily",57
NA,"totally incapacitated, those receiving",57
NA,special rate of war pension for tuberService,57
NA,"culosis, and those double amputees who",57
NA,receive additional amounts under the first,57
NA,six items of the Fifth Schedule. It provides,57
NA,also for increases in the intermediate,57
NA,"payable to those whose war-caused incasioners,",57
NA,pacity allows them to work only part time,57
NA,"or intermittently, ahd for an increase",57
NA,the rate of pension payable to war widows.,57
NA,The Bill also incorporates some amendyear,57
NA,ments to the Act of a machinery nature,57
NA,necessary for applying to Service penHouse.,57
NA,sioners the increases which are being pro-,57
NA,posed for age and invalid pensioners. The,57
NA,rates of war pension for which,57
NA,are proposed in this Bill are to be found in,57
NA,the schedules to the Repatriation Act.,57
NA,Although they are expressed in the Act as Is leave granted?,57
NA,"fortnightly amounts, it has long been the",57
NA,custom for honourable members to refer to,57
NA,penthe weekly amounts payable and 1 will,57
NA,continue this practice.,57
NA,The Bill provides for an amendment to,57
NA,the Second Schedule to the Act to give,57
NA,eifect to an increase of $1 a week for the,57
NA,special TPI rate of pension paid to those,57
NA,people whose war-caused incapacities pre-,57
NA,vent them from earning more than a neg-,57
NA,"ligible percentage of a living wage, to the",57
NA,war blinded and to certain sufferers from,57
NA,tuberculosis. The new rate will be $39 a,57
NA,"week, which will also apply to ex-service-",57
NA,men who are temporarily totally incapaci-,57
NA,tated. The amounts payable under the first,57
NA,six items of the Fifth Schedule for more,57
NA,severe incapacity resulting from double,57
NA,amputations will also be increased by $1 a,57
NA,week so that the total amount payable to,57
NA,these pensioners will continue to be equal,57
NA,to the TPI rate of pension. The intermedi-,57
NA,"ate rate, payable under the sixth footnote to",57
NA,"the First Schedule to those who, because",57
NA,"of of war-caused incapacity, can work only",57
NA,part time or intermittently and are thereby,57
NA,"unable to earn a living wage, will be",57
NA,increased by 50c a week. The new rate will,57
NA,be $28.50 a week. The Bill amends column,57
NA,3 of the First Schedule to provide an,57
NA,of 50c a week in war widows pen-,57
NA,"As honourable members will know, the",57
NA,Repatriation Act provides for payment of,57
NA,Service pensions at rates expressed in the,57
NA,Social Services Act as applying to age and,57
NA,"invalid pensions. However, to enable the",57
NA,new provisions proposed for age and inval-,57
NA,the id pensioners to be similarly applied to,57
NA,pensioners it has been necessary to,57
NA,make some machinery amendments to the,57
NA,"Repatriation Act. Clauses 3, 4 and 5 of the",57
NA,Bill do this. The increases iu this Bill will,57
NA,"rate benefit approximately 24,000 war pen-",57
NA,"49,500 war widows and 43,000",57
NA,Service pensioners. The Bill also appropria-,57
NA,in tes the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the,57
NA,extent necessary to provide in the current,57
NA,the additional payments to which this,57
NA,Bill gives effect. I commend the Bill to the,57
Mr BARNARD ,Befor e I move the,57
NA,adjournment of this debate I ask leave to,57
NA,increases make a short statement.,57
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Drury)-,57
NA,Mr Holten-No .,57
Mr BARNARD , I merely point out that it,58
NA,is a matter of courtesy,58
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Leav e is not,58
NA,granted.,58
Mr BARNARD ,A s a matter of courtesy a,58
NA,Minister makes available a copy of his sec-,58

NA,to lead for the Opposition on the Bill.,58
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! Leave,58
NA,is not granted.,58
Mr BARNARD ,I f the Minister on a,58
NA,future occasion attempts to introduce a Bill,58
NA,without acknowledging these usual cour-,58
NA,tesies he will not be granted leave to do so.,58
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! The,58
NA,Deputy Leader of the Opposition is out of,58
NA,order. He can make a statement only with,58
NA,leave of the House. He may move the,58
NA,adjournment of the debate.,58
NA,Mr Holten- Mr Deputy Speaker,58
Mr BARNARD , I understood leave was,58
NA,not granted.,58
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,B y indul-,58
NA,gence of the House the Minister for,58
NA,Repatriation may make a statement in,58
NA,reply to the statement just made by the,58
NA,Deputy Leader of the Opposition.,58
Mr BARNARD ,Leav e was not granted to,58
NA,me.,58
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! The,58
NA,Deputy Leader of the Opposition rose and,58
NA,commenced to make a statement. I pulled,58
NA,him up and pointed out that he needed to,58
NA,obtain leave of the House in order to,58
NA,make fhe statement. He persisted in mak-,58
NA,ing the statement and then sat down. By,58
NA,indulgence of the House I allowed the,58
NA,Minister for Repatriation to rise and make,58
NA,a brief reply to the Deputy Leader of the,58
NA,Opposition.,58
Dr PATTERSON , I rise to order. Under,58
NA,what section of Standing Orders have you,58
NA,the right to grant indulgence?,58
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! I rule,58
NA,that way.,58
Mr BARNARD , I raise a point of order. I,58
NA,asked leave to make a statement. You,58
NA,ruled me out of order. The Minister at the,58
NA,same time refused to grant me leave to,58
NA,make a statement. Therefore I think the,58
NA,matter is closed.,58
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Th e Deputy,58
NA,Leader of the Opposition knows quite well,58
NA,that in order to make a statement leave,58
NA,must be obtained first. Leave was not,58
NA,granted so it is outside the power of the,58
NA,Chair.,58
NA,Mr Holten- I wish to make a personal,58
NA,explanation.,58
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,I s leave,58
NA,granted?,58
Mr BARNARD ,No .,58
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Leav e is not,58
NA,granted.,58
Mr BARNARD , I ask leave to make a,58
NA,statement.,58
NA,Mr Holten-I f the Deputy Leader of,58
NA,the Opposition wishes to make the state-,58
NA,"ment he just indicated, leave is granted.",58
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,I s leave,58
NA,granted for the Deputy Leader of the,58
NA,Opposition to make a statement?,58
NA,Mr Holten-Yes .,58
Mr BARNARD ,Bass)-b y leave- I,58
NA,merely wanted to point out to the Minister,58
NA,for Repatriation ( Mr Holten) that as a,58
NA,matter of courtesy a Minister normally,58
NA,makes a copy of the second reading speech,58
NA,available to the member on this side of the,58
NA,House who is to move the adjournment of,58
NA,the debate. This was not done by the,58
NA,Minister. I wanted to make it perfectly,58
NA,clear that in these circumstances it is,58
NA,difficult for me to have to wait until,58
NA,tomorrow to read Hansard before I am in,58
NA,a position to recommend to honourable,58
NA,members on this side of the House what,58
NA,ought to be done. Hansard is not available,58
NA,until tomorrow morning. I want to indicate,58
NA,"to the Minister, in all fairness to him, that",58
NA,if he attempts on some future occasion to,58
NA,introduce a Bill into this House without,58
NA,obeying the normal rules of courtesy that,58
NA,apply leave will be refused.,58
NA,Mr Holten- I seek leave to make a very,58
NA,brief comment.,58
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,I s leave,58
NA,granted?,58
Mr BARNARD ,Yes .,58
Mr HOLTEN ,Indi-Ministe r for Repa-,58
NA,triation)-b y leave-Th e Deputy Leader of,58
NA,the Opposition ( Mr Barnard) was quite,58
NA,correct when he said that 1 did not give,58
NA,him a copy of the second reading speech. I,58
NA,can assure him that it was purely an,59
NA,sight. It was not meant to be a reflection,59
NA,on the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in,59
NA,any way. The position was that I just did,59
NA,not have a duplicate copy of the speech,59
NA,with me. I can assure the Deputy Leader,59
NA,"of the Opposition of 2 things. Firstly, if",59
NA,had explained to me in the first place the,59
NA,subject about which he wanted to make,59
NA,"the statement, of course I would have",59
NA,"granted him leave. Secondly, I can assure",59
NA,him that he will not have to wait until ances Act.,59
NA,tomorrow morning when Hansard is avail-,59
NA,able to get a copy of the second reading,59
NA,speech. I now hand it to him. I apologise,59
NA,to him and indicate that if the usual forms,59
NA,for the presentation of a second reading,59
NA,"speech by a Minister were not observed,",59
NA,the reason is fhat I overlooked them.,59

NA,That the Bill be now read a second time.,59
NA,It is thc usual practice of the Government,59
NA,to keep the rates of pensions,59
NA,ances payable to seamen war pensioners,59
NA,under the Seamen's War Pensions and,59
NA,Allowances Act in line with the rates of recovered) byThe,59
NA,pensions and allowances payable,59
NA,war pensioners under the Repatriation Act.,59
NA,The purpose of the Bill now before the,59
NA,"House is to raise, in relation to seamen,",59
NA,various rates of pension in line with the,59
NA,increases of corresponding rates being,59
NA,made in the Repatriation Bill just introamount,59
NA,"duced. These increases are in accordance sub-section,",59
NA,"with the higher rates recently announced plaint,",59
NA,by the Prime Minister.,59
NA,Clause 3 of the Bill increases the inter-,59
NA,mediate rate of war pension by SOc per,59
NA,week to $28.50. The intermediate pension,59
NA,is paid to seriously disabled persons whose,59
NA,war-caused incapacities render them incaa,59
NA,pable of working other than on a part-time,59
NA,"basis, or intermittently. Clause 4 substitutes",59
NA,a new First Schedule to the Act to provide,59
NA,for an increase of 50c in the weekly rate,59
NA,overof pension payable to widows of Aus-,59
NA,tralian mariners. The Bill does not have to,59
NA,provide for the increase of $1.00 to $39.00,59
NA,"per week in the rate of T.P.I, pension or",59
NA,for the increase of $1.00 in the weekly,59
NA,amounts payable in respect of certain disa-,59

NA,seamen pensioners by virtue of section 22A,59
NA,of the Seamen's War Pensions and Allow-,59
NA,As in the case in respect of the Repatria-,59
NA,"tion legislation, the Government wishes",59
NA,to make it clear that the increases in pen-,59
NA,sions for which the Bill provides will be,59
NA,"payable from 1st April 1971, and that the",59
NA,retrospectivity involved on this occasion,59
NA,because of the special circumstances,59
NA,should not be taken as a precedent for the,59
NA,"future, particularly in view of the very",59
NA,small time period involved and because of,59
NA,other factors to which I have already,59
NA,in my second reading speech on,59

NA,dence of the matter so averred or stated.,59
Dr PATTERSON ,Dawson) (8.50)- I,59
NA,move:,59
NA,Omit sub-clause (2.).,59
NA,This sub-clause deals with the recovery of,59
NA,levy. The Opposition has no quarrel with,59
NA,sub-clause (1.) which relates to amounts,59
NA,that may be recovered by the Common-,59
NA,wealth as debts due to the Commonwealth.,59
NA,That provision is quite straightforward but,59
NA,sub-clause (2.) is quite obnoxious and con-,60
NA,trary to British justice. What it means is,60
NA,"that any person, who has the right to go",60
NA,on to a producer's property if he or she,60
NA,"chooses, can make any averment whatso-",60
NA,ever and that averment then can be taken,60
NA,as evidence and there can be no argument,60
NA,against it. This contravenes the very,60
NA,essence of democracy. To make matters,60
NA,"worse the Commonwealth, if it is the pro-",60
NA,"secuting authority, can wait up to 5 years",60
NA,before the averment is dealt with. We will,60
NA,be dealing with that aspect soon. Any con-,60
NA,tention or any statement supposedly relat-,60
NA,ing to a complaint can be made by a per-,60
NA,son acting on behalf of the Common-,60
NA,"wealth. We must assume, therefore, that",60
NA,"every such person-publi c servant, bailiff",60
NA,or whatever he may be-concerne d with,60
NA,this legislation will be scrupulously honest,60
NA,to the degree that he would never bear a,60
NA,"grudge against a primary producer, never",60
NA,bear malice of any sort against any grower,60
NA,and never show any degree of bias. He,60
NA,will be a. pillar of virtue and impartial at,60
NA,every stage. We do not even accord this,60
NA,"degree of virtue to the professionals, the",60
NA,"police, yet we are prepared to accept any",60
NA,averment by a person who will be policing,60
NA,the levy.,60
NA,I find it incredible that a Country Party,60
NA,Minister can be a party to the sub-clause.,60
NA,One could imagine the admission of this,60
NA,type of evidence in some Gestapo state but,60
NA,it is foreign to Australian democracy. It is,60
NA,completely incredible that the Country,60
NA,Party Minister in charge of the Bill should,60
NA,agree to this type of averment against,60
NA,which there will be no argument. Any,60
NA,averment in the complaint by the plaintiff,60
NA,can be used as evidence and it may not be,60
NA,challenged for up to 5 years. Imagine this,60
NA,hanging over the head of a dried vine,60
NA,fruits producer who has a family to main-,60
NA,tain and whose children are going to,60
NA,school. But this is what the Government,60
NA,proposes. Australia is becoming almost a,60
NA,police state when the Minister for Primary,60
NA,Industry ( Mr Sinclair) starts these capers.,60
NA,The people whom the Minister allows to,60
NA,go on to properties to check trees or what-,60
NA,ever else it is can make an averment which,60
NA,can be used in evidence. For our part the,60
NA,Opposition will have no part of this.,60
Mr SINCLAIR ,New England-Ministe r,60
NA,for Primary Industry) (8.55)- I think that,60
NA,the honourable member for Dawson (Dr,60
NA,Patterson) has inferred that the introduc-,60
NA,tion of an averment provision is in some,60
NA,way denying the fundamental rights of,60
NA,"producers. In fact, the contrary is true. The",60
NA,"purpose of the Bill, as has been agreed to",60
NA,"generally during the second reading stage,",60
NA,is to provide for research for the purposes,60
NA,of the industry. The Bill does not levy a,60
NA,tax for consolidated revenue. It is designed,60
NA,to ensure that all growers join in con-,60
NA,tributing on a $1 for $1 basis with the,60
NA,Government to facilitate research which,60
NA,we all agree is highly desirable. That is the,60
NA,first point that it is essential for people to,60
NA,"recognise. Secondly, it is true that in order",60
NA,to ensure that all growers contribute it is,60
NA,necessary for there to be some sort of,60
NA,penal provision in the legislation so that,60
NA,one or two growers do not hang off and,60
NA,leave it to those many responsible growers,60
NA,who are prepared to make the contribution,60
NA,and over whom there is no necessity to,60
NA,have supervision. Those one or two grow-,60
NA,ers should not enjoy the advantages but,60
NA,deny the responsibilities which the provi-,60
NA,sion entails.,60
NA,In order to ensure that all growers con-,60
NA,tribute and that equity is done to growers,60
NA,"in the implementation of the Bill, which",60
NA,"we all agree is highly desirable, there are",60
NA,enforcement provisions. The way in which,60
NA,these enforcement provisions can be,60
NA,applied depends on the extent to which,60
NA,"inspectors are available. True, if we had an",60
NA,inspector in every packing shed or in every,60
NA,vineyard we would be able to get away,60
NA,without an averment procedure because it,60
NA,would then be possible to provide evidence,60
NA,"to show which fruits were being picked,",60
NA,what quantities were being consigned and,60
NA,"to which packing house, and the whole",60
NA,procedure would be simple and capable of,60
NA,"proof. But, of course, that is not the way",60
NA,in which the system operates. Relatively,60
NA,few inspectors are employed by the,60
NA,Department of Primary Industry in this,60
NA,"field, and rightly so. What we do is to",60
NA,provide a few inspectors who cover the,60
NA,whole field and who move around as,60
NA,quickly as their resources will allow.,60
NA,In no way are the growers harassed. In,60
NA,order to ensure that they are not harassed,60
NA,but so that those facts which are clearly,60
NA,within the knowledge of the grower can be,60
NA,determined there is an averment provision.,60
NA,The grower has the knowledge and under-,60
NA,"standing of what fruit has been delivered,",60
NA,what packing house has collected his fruit,61
NA,and what he has been paid for it. An aver-,61
NA,ment simply means that the Common-,61
NA,wealth can say that such and such is a fact,61
NA,and that fruit was delivered to a packing,61
NA,house but the grower has it completely,61
NA,within his knowledge to prove that this,61
NA,was not the case. He may have a delivery,61
NA,order indicating what fruit was delivered.,61
NA,The simple procedures of justice give him,61
NA,the capacity to deny what the Government,61
NA,would find it impossible to prove without a,61
NA,considerable back-up of inspectors. That is,61
NA,the reason for the inclusion of the aver-,61
NA,"ment, provision in this legislation and in",61
NA,many other similar pieces of legislation.,61
NA,is essential that we consider the general,61
NA,trouble and costs of administration which,61
NA,would be necessary if there were no aver-,61
NA,ment provision. This provision is not,61
NA,designed fbr the destruction of the rights,61
NA,of the grower. The contrary is the position.,61
NA,The purpose of the provision is to ensure,61
NA,that those facts which are not within the,61
NA,Government's knowledge can be averred,61
NA,and those facts which are within the grow-,61
NA,er's knowledge can be used to deny the,61
NA,averment if such should be necessary.,61
NA,"Accordingly, the Government will not",61
NA,accept the amendment.,61
Mr GRASSBY ,Riverina) (8.59)- I sup-,61
NA,port the points that were put by the hon-,61
NA,ourable member for Dawson (Dr Patter-,61
NA,son) and I want to comment on what was,61
NA,said by the Minister for Primary Industry,61
NA,( Mr Sinclair). The Minister says that the,61
NA,"whole of this clause, in fact the whole of",61
NA,the penal clauses of this Bill which the,61
NA,"Government is enacting, is there to ensure",61
NA,that one or two growers do not opt out,61
NA,or do not take advantage of the legis-,61
NA,lation and fail to make a proper contribu-,61
NA,tion. We accepted the principle of the leg-,61
NA,islation at the second reading stage but 1,61
NA,would point out to the Committee that we,61
NA,are talking about a penalty of $200. The,61
NA,major objection that we put forward is,61
NA,that under the offending sub-clause (2.),61
NA,of the actions by the inspector are,61
NA,validated and accepted while all tbe evi-,61
NA,dence of the growers can be challenged. It,61
NA,"seems to me, as the honourable meniber",61
NA,"for Dawson has said, that this sets aside",61
NA,"important legal provisions and processes,",61
NA,"provisions which are in many Acts, in",61
NA,many statutes. In relation to this matter,61
NA,a possible penalty of $200 what is being,61
NA,said here is that all of the statements by,61
NA,the inspectors-an d the Minister admits he,61
NA,does not have many-ar e accepted. If the,61
NA,"inspector does call, no matter how hur-",61
NA,riedly he conducts his investigation and no,61
NA,"matter how mistaken he may be, his state-",61
NA,ment is to be accepted.,61
NA,"Surely this is a sweeping, hammer-like",61
NA,provision to put into a piece of legislation,61
NA,where we are dealing-an d the Minister,61
NA,has admitted this-wit h possibly only one,61
NA,or two growers. He is setting aside a great,61
NA,principle for a very sniall reason. But the,61
NA,thing that concerns me perhaps even more,61
NA,It than the offending sub-clause (2.) is the,61
NA,provision that a prosecution for an offence,61
NA,against this sub-clause may be commenced,61
NA,at any time within 5 years. This is not,61
NA,reasonable. Imagine the situation of a man,61
NA,standing for public office. Five years pre-,61
NA,viously he could have committed an occur-,61
NA,rence for which action against him could,61
NA,possibly have been initiated. It may not,61
NA,"have been initiated. It may be, of course,",61
NA,that someone with an eye to denying him,61
NA,"public office could say: 'Well, it would be",61
NA,a very good idea to go ahead with this,61
NA,action now.' Surely there is no real,61
NA,reason,61
The CHAIRMAN , Mr Lucock),61
NA,Order! ] think the honourable member for,61
NA,Riverina is possibly confusing the 2,61
NA,amendments which were foreshadowed.,61
NA,The one that the Committee is considering,61
NA,at the moment refers to clause 8 (2.) which,61
NA,deals with proceedings for the recovery of,61
NA,an amount referred to. The matter of 5,61
NA,years and 12 months is dealt with in the,61
NA,second amendment proposed to be moved.,61
Mr GRASSBY," I am sorry; I defer, of",61
NA,course. I will withhold my comments on,61
NA,that until a later stage. I would just say in,61
NA,conclusion that I would like to submit to,61
NA,the Minister that this is taking a very,61
NA,heavy hammer in relation to the accept-,61
NA,ance of evidence in this matter and setting,61
NA,aside a great principle for something,61
NA,"all involving, in fact, one or two growers. I",61
NA,think it is a noxious provision and we,61
NA,would be opposed to it.,61
Dr PATTERSON ,Dawson) (9.3)- I,61
NA,would like to comment briefly on what the,61
NA,Minister for Primary Industry ( Mr Sin-,61
NA,clair) said. Taking what he has said to be,61
NA,of true it would seem that this clause was,61
NA,inserted in the Bill to deal with only a few,61
NA,"people. I would submit that clause 11,",62
NA,- which we have not dealt with but which is,62
NA,"relevant, deals with a person who fails to",62
NA,furnish returns and provide basic informa-,62
NA,tion and the penalty of S200 is sufficient.,62
NA,"In fact, I would submit that if this were",62
NA,omitted thc Bill would be just as viable,62
NA,and just as lethal. I really do not believe,62
NA,that the fact that it is in other research,62
NA,Bills that have gone through is relevant.,62
NA,That does not impress me at all; that does,62
NA,not mean it is right. But I would submit,62
NA,lhat if this were taken out it would not,62
NA,weaken the Bill in any way because we,62
NA,have clause 11 which fully protects the,62
NA,inspectors and enables the Commonwealth,62
NA,to take the defaulters to court. The penal-,62
NA,ties are there. But to me this is a question,62
NA,of the violation of a principle. This is,62
NA,obnoxious to the idea of justice which we,62
NA,"in this country support, and frankly, I find",62
NA,"it, as I said before, rather incredible that",62
NA,the Country Party would be wanting to put,62
NA,something in a Bill which oould in fact,62
NA,lead to abuse and the penalising of,62
NA,primary producers.,62

NA,move:,62
NA,"In sub-clause (2.), omit 'five years', insert",62
NA,'twelve months'.,62
NA,Sub-clause (2.) of clause 11 of this Bill,62
NA,deals with prosecution for an offence under,62
NA,this clause and it provides that prosecution,62
NA,may be commenced at any time within 5,62
NA,years after the commission of the offence.,62
NA,The part of clause II which the Opposi-,62
NA,tion seeks to amend is that which relates,62
NA,to the time limit within which prosecution,62
NA,may be commenced. The Opposition takes,62
NA,Tellers: the view that to allow a prosecution for,62
NA,such an offence to be commenced at any,62
NA,time within 5 years after the commission,63
NA,of the offence is contrary to the spirit of,63
NA,this Bill. The offences covered in clause 11,63
NA,are not criminal offences. The Minister,63
NA,went to great pains to say that the levy is,63
NA,to be collected from persons concerned,63
NA,with the dried fruits industry and that the,63
NA,Commonwealth will provide matching,63
NA,grants. In the event of an offence against,63
NA,clause 11 a certain penalty can be,63
NA,imposed. The Opposition's objection to,63
NA,clause 11 is the time of 5 years within,63
NA,which a prosecution may be commenced.,63
NA,"One can imagine that if a grower, a packer",63
NA,or someone concerned with the provisions,63
NA,of this Bill committed some criminal,63
NA,offence the time limit of 5 years within,63
NA,which to commence prosecution may well,63
NA,"apply. However, one can imagine a trivial",63
NA,offence being committed by such a person.,63
NA,"For example, an inspector may find some-",63
NA,thing wrong and this would be hanging,63
NA,over the head of the producer and his,63
NA,family; they would be waiting for the,63
NA,Commonwealth to make up its mind to,63
NA,prosecute. I believe this is wrong and con-,63
NA,trary to British justice.,63
NA,If the Commonwealth Government is,63
NA,properly to administer the provisions of,63
NA,this Bill it should be able to commence,63
NA,proceedings within 12 months. Why should,63
NA,it have to wait up to 5 years? This is an,63
NA,incredible clause. With all the resources,63
NA,"available to the Commonwealth, if it can-",63
NA,not prosecute within 12 months after the,63
NA,commission of such an offence it must be,63
NA,guilty of mismanagement. This clause is,63
NA,offensive and it is contrary to the spirit of,63
NA,this Bill. It is not a Bill which makes,63
NA,provision for criminal proceedings. The,63
NA,Government should be able to commence,63
NA,proceedings within 12 months of the com-,63
NA,mission of the offence. This is why the,63
NA,Opposition has moved this amendment.,63
Mr GRASSBY ,Riverina) (9.17)-Earlie r,63
NA,I was directing my remarks to the,63
NA,wrong clause but let me direct myself very,63
NA,specifically to sub-clause (2.) of clause,63
NA,The honourable member for Dawson (Dr,63
NA,Patterson) has referred to this incredible,63
NA,provision to which I previously referred.,63
NA,The provision contained in this clause is,63
NA,that prosecution for an offence against,63
NA,clause 11 may be commenced at any time,63
NA,within 5 years after the commission of the,63
NA,offence. Let us look at what the Govern-,63
NA,ment has done. It has the agreement of the,63
NA,industry to have a levy for a certain pur-,63
NA,pose. This is desirable and we agree tbat,63
NA,all growers should contribute and should,63
NA,"bear an equal burden. There can, of",63
NA,"course, be accidental circumstances in",63
NA,which returns are not lodged or in which,63
NA,the information provided may not be,63
NA,totally accurate. Mistakes may be made by,63
NA,"the grower, in good faith. Mistakes may be",63
NA,"made by government inspectors, also in",63
NA,good faith. Let us be quite clear on this.,63
NA,The onus here is on the grower.,63
NA,What we have agreed to is that anything,63
NA,the inspector says in evidence is to be,63
NA,accepted! There is to be no argument,63
NA,about it. This places the whole onus on fhe,63
NA,grower. I agree with the honourable mem-,63
NA,ber for Dawson that the provisions of sub-,63
NA,clause (2.) are against the principles of jus-,63
NA,tice as they have applied in this country.,63
NA,In regard to the nature of the offence we,63
NA,find that the provision relates to the failure,63
NA,or neglect to furnish a return or the fur-,63
NA,nishing of a return or information that is,63
NA,false or misleading. The penalty provided,63
NA,is $200. That is not an inconsiderable pen-,63
NA,"alty, but the onus is on the grower. The",63
NA,government inspectors enshrined in this,63
NA,legislation are never to be permitted to,63
NA,make an error. That is an incredible piece,63
NA,"of infallibility, but there it it. We lost the",63
NA,vote on that issue and it has now been,63
NA,accepted. Now we are being asked to,63
NA,"accept this, time limit in relation to this",63
NA,awful offence of failing to make a return,63
NA,or making an inaccurate return. Of course,63
NA,it is an offence but we are being asked to,63
NA,give the Commonwealth a period of 5,63
NA,years in which to launch a prosecution for,63
NA,such an offence. I draw the attention of,63
NA,this Committee to the fact that under the,63
NA,Crimes Act the statutory time limit for,63
NA,certain offences is 6 months. The Crimes,63
NA,Act deals with serious matters including,63
NA,assault on the person. It deals with a,63
NA,whole range of real crimes. In such a case,63
NA,the onus is on the State to marshal its case,63
NA,and to take action within 6 months. In this,63
NA,11. case for this awful crime on the part of,63
NA,the grower of not furnishing his return or,63
NA,of making some inaccuracy in it we are,63
NA,asked to give the Commonwealth a period,63
NA,of 5 years within which to launch a prose-,63
NA,cution. This is an incredible provision. The,63
NA,Opposition is opposed to it. I hope that the,63
NA,Minister will have second thoughts about,63
NA,it.,63
NA,I want to come back to a point which I,64
NA,previously mentioned. There could well be,64
NA,a situation in which a man has decided to,64
NA,contest a public oflice. A prosecution could,64
NA,be launched against him many years after,64
NA,the event. Let us imagine what happens in,64
NA,relation to the case. The case comes for-,64
NA,"ward and the inspector's evidence must,",64
NA,"under this Biil, be accepted. But perhaps",64
NA,the defendant's witnesses have died and,64
NA,their evidence is lost. The defendant is,64
NA,"standing there naked and unashamed, with-",64
NA,out any hope of opposing the whole weight,64
NA,and resources of tbe Commonwealth in a,64
NA,matter such as this. Surely this is not,64
NA,reasonable. I hope that the Minister will,64
NA,take very serious note of the objection and,64
NA,refer to the Crimes Act in which there is,64
NA,an analogy. A Stale in these serious mat-,64
NA,ters is allowed only 6 months in which to,64
NA,act.,64
NA,"The Commonwealth, with all the powers",64
NA,"that it has taken unto itself-and , after",64
NA,"this is not a very impressive offence, but",64
NA,is certainly a material one; let us put,64
NA,its proper perspective-i s asking for,64
NA,period of 5 years in which it can act. I head.,64
NA,submit this is neither desirable nor just. I,64
NA,ask the Minister to examine the submis-,64
NA,sions we have made in a reasonable way.,64
NA,We agree tbat one or two growers might,64
NA,"want to be gently brought into line, but",64
NA,surely to goodness we do not want to drag,64
NA,the growers through a long drawn out,64
NA,period of prosecution in the way which,64
NA,envisaged under this Bill.,64
Mr TURNBULL ,Mallee) (9.21)-Th e,64
NA,honourable member for Riverina ( Mr For,64
NA,Grassby) when he spoke on the last,64
NA,amendment on which we have voted at,64
NA,first advanced one step to this amendment.,64
NA,Now he has retreated one step in order,64
NA,speak about the amendment which has,64
NA,"been defeated. Therefore, very briefly I",64
NA,"want to do the same thing. But first of all,",64
NA,the Minister has said that the word of the,64
NA,inspector is to be taken as the basis,64
NA,"charge, but he said that after that all the",64
NA,appropriate laws in Australia are open,64
NA,the grower to show that the charge is not,64
NA,correct. The honourable membeT for Dawof,64
NA,son (Dr Patterson) said that for 5 years,64
NA,charge could be hanging over the heads,64
NA,the grower and his family who would be,64
NA,wondering whether he was to be charged.,64
NA,The honourable member for Dawson nods,64
NA,his head to indicate that he accepts what,64
NA,have said. What does the Bill state? Clause,64
NA,11 (1.) states:,64
NA,A person shall not-,64
NA,(a) fail or neglect duly to furnish a return or,64
NA,information that he is required under the,64
NA,regulations to furnish;,64
NA,This is the basis of the whole legislation,64
NA,because it is imperative that the scheme,64
NA,must embrace all growers. If a number of,64
NA,growers were to remain outside the,64
NA,"scheme, the scheme could fail and at least",64
NA,would be unfair. Clause 11 (1.) continues:,64
NA,"(b) furnish, in pursuance of the regulations, a",64
NA,return or information that is false or mis-,64
NA,leading in a material particular.,64
NA,The point I make is that the honourable,64
NA,"member for Dawson, by nodding his head,",64
NA,indicated he agreed with me when I said,64
NA,that he said a grower's family could have a,64
NA,charge hanging over its head and it would,64
NA,be wondering whether the grower was to,64
NA,be charged. But if a prosecution is com-,64
NA,"all, menced towards the end of S years, the",64
NA,it grower must have known all the time that,64
NA,"it in he had committed an offence, otherwise",64
NA,a the threat would not be hanging over his,64
NA,I turn now to what the honourable,64
NA,member for Riverina said about this clause,64
NA,creating a great injustice and about the,64
NA,fact that inspectors may not be infallible.,64
NA,"Of course, they may not be infallible.",64
NA,Then he said the criminal law provides,64
NA,is that a prosecution for an offence must be,64
NA,commenced within 6 months. I am not,64
NA,"sure whether that is right, but I know that",64
NA,he has not referred to the taxation law.,64
NA,what period after an offence has been,64
NA,discovered can a prosecution for an,64
NA,offence under the taxation law be com-,64
NA,menced? A prosecution can be commenced,64
NA,to during a period longer than 5 years.,64
Dr PATTERSON ,Ho w do you know?,64
Mr TURNBULL, 1 know that. Of,64
NA,"of the course, the honourable member for",64
NA,Riverina does not refer to the taxation law,64
NA,to because it does not suit his argument. If,64
NA,we look at the report of the Commissioner,64
NA,Taxation we find that certain people,64
NA,a have been charged with offences which,64
NA,of have been committed 10 years previously*,64
NA,These people did wrong by not providing,64
NA,the right information when they submitted,64
NA,their taxation returns. This Bill is on all,64
NA,I fours with the taxation law. It is only,64
NA,asking people to do what is right. If prose-,65
NA,cutions can be commenced under the taxa-,65
NA,tion law all these years after offences have,65
NA,"been committed, why does the Opposition",65
NA,"say that the provision in this Bill, which",65
NA,says that a prosecution for an offence may,65
NA,"be commenced within 5 years, is wrong",65
NA,and that the period should be only 1 year?,65
NA,"If this were the case, a person who did not",65
NA,submit his taxation return correctly could,65
NA,not be charged after 1 year from the time,65
NA,of the commission of the offence. This is,65
NA,the whole story. It is perfectly inconsistent,65
NA,for the honourable member for Riverina to,65
NA,say that we should forget about a large,65
NA,sum of money which should properly be,65
NA,paid to the Commonwealth by way of,65
NA,taxation and try to make a political case,65
NA,out of the provision now before the,65
NA,chamber. This is completely wrong. It is,65
NA,preventing the real situation from being,65
NA,revealed and it is trying to build up a case,65
NA,on a very frail foundation.,65
Mr DUTHIE ,Wilmot) (9.26)- I reject,65
NA,entirely the argument advanced by the,65
NA,honourable member for Malice ( Mr,65
NA,bull). There is no similarity between this,65
NA,Bill and the taxation law. Clause 11 (2.),65
NA,the Bill states:,65
NA,A prosecution for an offence against this,65
NA,tion may be commenced at any time within five,65
NA,years after the commission of the offence.,65
NA,"That is, 5 years after the mistake has been",65
NA,discovered by the inspector. The taxation,65
NA,law refers to offences which are discovered,65
NA,much later after they have been commitdiscovered,65
NA,ted. The honourable member for Mallee,65
NA,referred to prosecutions being commenced,65
NA,under the taxation law after a period of,65
NA,years. Although something may have hapter,65
NA,"pened 10 years previously, the prosecution",65
NA,was commenced immediately the offence,65
NA,was discovered. But under this clause,65
NA,the Bill there could be a delay of 5 years have now.,65
NA,before a prosecution was commenced,65
NA,against a grower who failed to carry,65
NA,the terms of the clause. This is why I,65
NA,claim it is a terrible injustice to provide,65
NA,that a prosecution may be commenced at,65
NA,any time within 5 years.,65
NA,I want to ask the Minister two or three,65
NA,questions. Can he refer to similar legislation,65
NA,in which such an amazing and incredible,65
NA,provision is included? This means that,65
NA,if a person broke into a house and subseinefficiencies,65
NA,"quently was apprehended, the prosecution",65
NA,could wait for 5 years before it brought,65
NA,charge against him. What an outrageous,65
NA,concept.,65
NA,Mr Adermann-D o you want to let him,65
NA,off?,65
Mr DUTHIE,"No , we do not want to",65
NA,let him off. We want him to be charged,65
NA,within 12 months of it being discovered,65
NA,that he has committed an offence. Within,65
NA,those 5 years the grower against whom a,65
NA,prosecution was commenced could die. He,65
NA,could be killed in an accident or he could,65
NA,die from natural causes. Will the Govern-,65
NA,ment then withdraw the charge against him,65
NA,because he is no longer alive to be,65
NA,charged? If the charge is not withdrawn on,65
NA,the death of the grower who has commit-,65
NA,"ted an offence, will the grower's wife have",65
NA,the spectre of the prosecution hanging over,65
NA,her head for a period up to 5 years after,65
NA,her husband's death? These factors ought,65
NA,to be considered in a humanitarian way.,65
NA,No humanitarianism is shown in this,65
NA,clause at all. It is a vicious clause. There is,65
NA,no common sense about it. What the,65
NA,clause is telling the Committee and the,65
NA,Turncountry is that the Commonwealth's,65
NA,officers are so inefficient and so confound-,65
NA,of edly lazy that it will take them 5 years to,65
NA,bring a charge against a person who has,65
NA,seccommitted an offence. Let us assume that,65
NA,this Bill is passed in the next week or two.,65
NA,"Let us assume that, during the next season,",65
NA,an offence is committed by a grower either,65
NA,by withholding information or by giving,65
NA,misleading information. If that offence is,65
NA,"at the beginning of 1972, clause",65
NA,11 gives the Commonwealth until the,65
NA,beginning of 1977 to charge that grower,65
NA,10 with that offence. I believe that fhe Minis-,65
NA,is a pretty capable man. I admire him.,65
NA,But if he permits a clause of this type to,65
NA,remain in the legislation I wiil have only,65
NA,in half the respect for the Minister that I,65
Mr SINCLAIR ,New England-Ministe r,65
NA,out for Primary Industry) (9.31)- Mr Chair-,65
NA,"man, I think that my dear friend, the hon-",65
NA,"ourable member for Wilmot ( Mr Duthie),",65
NA,has the wrong understanding altogether of,65
NA,this clause. Before the debate gets too far,65
NA,"off the rails, perhaps I ought to explain",65
NA,what this clause is all about. It is not a,65
NA,"clause, any more than clause 8 is, which is",65
NA,designed to try to cloud in any way the,65
NA,or ineptitudes of officers of,65
NA,the Commonwealth Public Service. The,65
NA,a whole purpose of the clause is to try to,65
NA,"ensure that, without having an army of",66
NA,"inspectors, it will be possible to prosecute",66
NA,somebody who. in accordance with any of,66
NA,the criteria set down in clause 11 (I.) (a) or,66
NA,"(b), adjusts his returns in a false way or",66
NA,gives misleading information. The clause is,66
NA,designed so that such people can be,66
NA,brought before a court.,66
NA,The Department in fact does not have,66
NA,an army of inspectors. It provides a few,66
NA,inspectors only. I specifically went through,66
NA,this clause with my officers to try to find,66
NA,out why a period of 5 years rather than a,66
NA,"shorter period was set down, lt was",66
NA,explained to me that in fact many packing,66
NA,sheds would not see an inspector in 5,66
NA,"years, lf the requirement was that a pros-",66
NA,"ecution be launched within 12 months, the",66
NA,Department would need to appoint a con-,66
NA,siderably greater number of inspectors with,66
NA,"the dire consequence, as I explained when",66
NA,"dealing with the earlier amendment, that a",66
NA,battery of inspectors would be intruding,66
NA,constantly on the normal way of packing,66
NA,and on the normal operations of growers. I,66
NA,do not believe that that is the sort of prin-,66
NA,ciple on which any honourable member,66
NA,would wan! the Government to act.,66
NA,The reason for the inclusion of the,66
NA,period of 5 years is to cover the time,66
NA,within which it should be reasonably,66
NA,"sible for the Department, maintaining the ment.",66
NA,sort of inspection services that it does and,66
NA,without any undue interference in the,66
NA,"packing operations of growers, to go about",66
NA,"its inspections and, if there is an instance",66
NA,where a person has committed an offence,66
NA,"prescribed, that person can be brought",66
NA,before a court. The penalty prescribed is,66
NA,maximum penalty. A court is at liberty,66
NA,fine anything less than that amount accordalso,66
NA,ing to thc circumstances of the offence.,66
NA,The whole purpose of the provision of,66
NA,period of 5 years is not to try to cover,66
NA,any way the inefficiencies of the DepartRiverina,66
NA,"ment, but rather lo ensure that it will",66
NA,be necessary to engage a battery of inspecincome,66
NA,tors and that it will be quite practicable,66
NA,within the present resources of the Departhis,66
NA,"ment, with the co-operation of growers,",66
NA,ensure that there is a reasonable compliclarify.,66
NA,ance with the requirements of the legisla-,66
NA,tion. It seems to me that the period of 5,66
NA,years is not unreasonable if it is taken,66
NA,account in that light.,66
NA,The honourable member for Wilmot did,66
NA,ask a question relating to the family of,66
NA,"deceased fruit grower who, in some way,",66
NA,may have commited one of these offences.,66
NA,The honourable member asked as to the,66
NA,"liability, for example, of that grower's",66
NA,widow. My general understanding is that if,66
NA,that beneficiary had in any way been a,66
NA,"party to the offence, she would be one of",66
NA,"those who would be included, but that if",66
NA,the offence had been committed by the,66
NA,husband and she was not a party to it in,66
NA,"any way, without being sure of the exact",66
NA,legal position I would think that those cir-,66
NA,cumstances certainly would be taken into,66
NA,account when any action was being consid-,66
NA,ered. I do not think that any beneficiaries,66
NA,of any deceased person referred to in the,66
NA,legislation need really be concerned unless,66
NA,they themselves have been a party to the,66
NA,falsification or otherwise.,66
NA,"Accordingly, while I can sympathise",66
NA,with the point that has been put forward,66
NA,by the honourable member for Dawson,66
NA,"(Dr Patterson), 1 assure him that the pur-",66
NA,pose of the 5 years term is not as has been,66
NA,suggested but purely to ensure that in the,66
NA,process of normal administration no neces-,66
NA,sity arises to create an army of inspectors,66
NA,and that some capacity still exists within,66
NA,the Department to prosecute if an offence,66
NA,"should be commited. Accordingly, the",66
NA,posGovernment does not accept the amend-,66
Mr FOSTER ,Sturt) (9.35)- Mr Chair-,66
NA,"man, I rise to support the amendment.",66
NA,With all due respect to the honourable,66
NA,member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) I am,66
NA,somewhat disappointed that the period pre-,66
NA,a scribed by the amendment is not 6 months,66
NA,to instead of 12 months as proposed. I rise,66
NA,because the honourable member for,66
NA,Mallee ( Mr Turnbull) has seen fit to mis-,66
NA,a construe the objectiveness of the speech,66
NA,in that was made by my friend and -:ol-,66
NA,"league, the honourable member for",66
NA,( Mr Grassby). The honourable,66
NA,not member went into some discourse on,66
NA,tax. No doubt he was referring to,66
NA,"the Premier of Queensland, a member of",66
NA,"own Party, Mr Bjelke-Petersen. I do",66
NA,to not know; that is a matter for him to,66
NA,Another reason why I have risen is the,66
NA,into very weak and wishy washy manner in,66
NA,which the Minister for Primary Industry,66
NA,( Mr Sinclair) sought to justify clause 11 of,66
NA,a the Bill. In his closing remarks he more,66
NA,than implied that a person who has sub-,67
NA,mitted a return that he believes to be abso-,67
NA,"lutely true may be said by his Department,",67
NA,"some 5 years later, to be guilty of an",67
NA,offence if it is found that the return is in,67
NA,part false. The Opposition has questioned,67
NA,what this would mean in the case where,67
NA,the business of that grower was in joint,67
NA,"names, that is, either husband or wife, or",67
NA,the grower and his son. The Minister in,67
NA,"his explanation, as far as I am concerned,",67
NA,has not been clear enough as to whether,67
NA,there could not be some form of prosecu-,67
NA,"tion, per se, even after the death of that",67
NA,grower. At no time did I feel that the hon-,67
NA,ourable member for Riverina was speaking,67
NA,of people who would in conscience offend.,67
NA,"As I understood the honourable member,",67
NA,he was putting to the Committee the dis-,67
NA,tinction between the person who uncon-,67
NA,sciously commits an offence- I use the,67
NA,term 'offence' with some degree of reluc-,67
NA,"tance, but it is contained in this measure-",67
NA,and the person who in conscience commits,67
NA,an offence.,67
NA,Listening to the speech by the honour-,67
NA,"able member for Mallee ( Mr Turnbull),",67
NA,honourable members would think that 50,67
NA,per cent of the growers would be classed,67
NA,as offenders. I visualise those growers,67
NA,"ing for the months and years to go by and,",67
NA,"in 5 years time, in the Murray area gener-",67
NA,ally a great stampede of people occurring,67
NA,with growers throwing their hats in the,67
NA,and saying: 'We are off the hook; the 5,67
NA,years have elapsed'. That was the way in,67
NA,which the honourable member for Mallee,67
NA,approaching this provision.,67
NA,1 believe that the provision that a prosof,67
NA,ecution for an offence may be commenced,67
NA,at any time within 5 years after the comto,67
NA,mission of the offence is quite stupid.,67
NA,Surely the system under which the industry,67
NA,"operates is that a check, even a self-evident",67

NA,a person was being dishonest to the degree,67
NA,provided by this clause of the Bill. I,67
NA,opposed to this long drawn out delay in,67
NA,prosecution. The threat of the Government,67
NA,filching a fine of $200 from a grower for,67
NA,such an offence exists for 5 years. A grower,67
NA,"may discover in the second year, after",67
NA,"unknowingly committing an offence,",67
NA,he has committed an offence. He may,67
NA,endeavour to cover up that offence by,67
NA,"committing further offences in the second,",67
NA,third and fourth years. Because of the be followed.,67
NA,threat of prosecution from the Department,67
NA,his conscience is under quite a burden as a,67
NA,result of an honest mistake he has made.,67
NA,Is this the way in which a penalty should,67

NA,The Minister has said that the Govern-,67

NA,Let me say this to the Minister: If he,67
NA,wishes to catch up with the smarties he,67
NA,will have a job including all necessary pro-,67
NA,visions in a Bill to give protection against,67
NA,such smarties. What the Government possi-,67

NA,debate is resumed on this Bill I would like,67
NA,suggest that it may suit the convenience,67
NA,of the House to have a general debate,67
NA,"covering the Pig Industry Research Bill,",67
NA,the Pig Slaughter Levy Bill and the Pig,67
NA,Slaughter Levy Collection Bill as they are,67
NA,related measures in a similar way to the,67

NA,"There being no objection, that course will",67
Dr PATTERSON ,Dawson) (9.41)-Th e,68
NA,objective of the Pig Industry Research Bill,68
NA,1971 is to provide for the establishment and,68
NA,to enable the operation of a Common-,68
NA,wealth industry research scheme for the,68
NA,Australian pig industry. This Bili follows,68
NA,in principle the Dried Fruits Research Bill,68
NA,which we have just discussed. We are dis-,68
NA,cussing 3 Bills in this debate. One makes,68
NA,provision for the establishment of a research,68
NA,scheme: the second Bill authorises the,68
NA,imposition of a levy for research purposes;,68
NA,and the third Bill deals with the machinery,68
NA,for the collection of that levy. The basic,68
NA,objective i.s for a levy to be imposed on al!,68
NA,"pigs slaughtered for human consumption,",68
NA,the moneys collected to be used to finance,68
NA,research schemes for the benefit of the pig,68
NA,industry throughout Australia. Under this,68
NA,proposal the maximum levy will be 10c,68
NA,per pig slaughtered. As with other research,68
NA,"Bills, there is an operative rate and this",68
NA,has been fixed by the Pig Slaughter Levy,68
NA,Collection Bill at 5c per pig.,68
NA,in his second reading speech the Minister,68
NA,for Primary Industry ( Mr Sinclair) esti-,68
NA,"mated that approximately $150,000 to",68
NA,"$165,000 will be collected from the levy.",68
NA,He also said that the Commonwealth will,68
NA,make matching grants on a $1 for $1 basis.,68
NA,"In other words, the total funds available to",68
NA,the industry for research will be double the,68
NA,amount collected. The levy will be payable,68
NA,"by abattoirs and they will, of course, be",68
NA,the places where the pigs are to be,68
NA,slaughtered. The incidence of the levy will,68
NA,fall on the owner of the pigs at the time,68
NA,of slaughter. The pig industry is another,68
NA,industry which has joined the ranks of,68
NA,research. At the present time it is estimated,68
NA,that approximately 70 per cent of the total,68
NA,value of primary production or rural pro-,68
NA,duction in Australia-an d this includes the,68
NA,pig industry-i s actually covered by pro-,68
NA,ducers who are making payments for the,68
NA,purposes of research. Therefore we have,68
NA,self-help which is backed by Federal,68
NA,finance. The Minister has informed us that,68
NA,the request for research arose through the,68
NA,Australian Commercial Pig Producers,68
NA,Federation which is the Federal organisation,68
NA,of thc pig industry. The Federation consists,68
NA,of 6 State councils which represent the,68
NA,"great majority, as the Minister has said,",68
NA,of the pig farmers in Australia.,68
NA,The Minister said that the ACPPF speaks,68
NA,with a national voice. He implied that all,68
NA,"pig bodies are represented. This, ot course,",68
NA,is not strictly true. The Minister's second,68
NA,reading speech implied that the decision to,68
NA,implement a research scheme was a unani-,68
NA,mous one. From reading the Minister's,68
NA,second reading speech one gains the,68
NA,impression that the Federal body speaks,68
NA,with a national voice and it could be in-,68
NA,ferred that the whole of the industry was,68
NA,"behind it. However, the pig committee of",68
NA,the Victorian Farmers Union does not agree,68
NA,with the proposition which is before the,68
NA,"House. Also, the Australian Primary Pro-",68
NA,ducers Union pig committee in Queensland,68
NA,does not agree. I believe that the Minister,68
NA,should have stated this in his second read-,68
NA,"ing speech. It is desirable that, if possible,",68
NA,all organisations of a particular industry,68
NA,should be within a Federal body. I have,68
NA,always argued in this House that it is far,68
NA,better to speak with one voice than to speak,68
NA,with a divided voice.,68
NA,A delegation from the pig committee of,68
NA,the Victorian Farmers Union saw members,68
NA,of the Opposition and expressed the opinion,68
NA,to us that they would first of all like to,68
NA,see a referendum before legislation for a,68
NA,compulsory levy was introduced in this,68
NA,House. The delegation informed members,68
NA,of the Opposition that there was a signifi-,68
NA,cant difference of opinion on this issue,68
NA,within the industry throughout Australia. I,68
NA,made it clear to members of the delegation,68
NA,th^t if they could prove this and if in fact,68
NA,there was a considerable difference of,68
NA,opinion and widespread opposition to a levy,68
NA,for research in the pig industry the Opposi-,68
NA,tion would take a responsible attitude and,68
NA,raise this question with the Government in,68
NA,the Parliament. The policy of the Australian,68
NA,Labor Party is quite clear: If there is evi-,68
NA,dence of widespread opposition from the,68
NA,"rank and file pig producers, we believe a",68
NA,referendum should be held.,68
NA,Let me summarise the policy of the Aus-,68
NA,tralian Labor Party in respect of such a,68
NA,compulsory levy. If an industry asks for,68
NA,research and if a government believes that,68
NA,this research is in the best interests of the,68
NA,industrj' and the nation-an d this includes,68
NA,the consumers-tha t research levy should,68
NA,"be implemented. Tn other words, if there",68
NA,is a unanimous decision within the industry,68
NA,and if the Government believes that such a,68
NA,levy is in the best interests of the nation,68
NA,"and the industry, measures to effect it",68
NA,"should be implemented. In this case, if",68
NA,there is uncertainty to the degree that there,69
NA,is a wide difference of opinion and open,69
NA,opposition among the rank and file pig pro-,69
NA,"ducers, newspapers, delegations, parlia-",69
NA,"mentary representatives and so on, of",69
NA,course producers should have the right to,69
NA,express that opinion through a referendum.,69
NA,"As an example, we can recall that some",69
NA,years ago a price reserve scheme was pro-,69
NA,"posed for wool, although this was not a",69
NA,compulsory levy. Just recently we had a,69
NA,stabilisation scheme proposal for the dried,69
NA,"vine fruits industry. Also, we hoped that",69
NA,the Government would allow a referendum,69
NA,because of the widespread opposition to the,69
NA,lifting of the embargo of merino sheep.,69
NA,There has been wide opposition to all of,69
NA,these schemes. There has been wide opposi-,69
NA,tion to the degree that members of Parlia-,69
NA,ment received constant delegations from the,69
NA,rank and file primary producers and a crosswould,69
NA,section of the community. There was a,69
NA,definite case for a referendum. The Pig,69
NA,Committee of the Victorian Farmers Union,69
NA,has made it clear to us in writing that its,69
NA,pig producers are not opposed to research,69
NA,or a levy for research purposes. It seems,69
NA,tbat what they are basically opposed to is,69
NA,the way in which research moneys are,69
NA,allocated. They question the priorities on,69
NA,which research funds are allocated.,69
NA,The main point I am making here is that,69
NA,the Opposition has given very careful con-,69
NA,sideration to whether or not it should,69
NA,move an amendment to defer this legislation,69
NA,until a referendum has been held. After,69
NA,careful consideration and consultation we,69
NA,came to the conclusion that this would not,69
NA,be fair unless we received evidence of,69
NA,spread opposition from pig producers them-,69
NA,"selves. To be quite fair, despite previous",69
NA,concern and the possible need for a referenthe,69
NA,"dum, we have not had this widespread",69
NA,opposition to the imposition of a research,69
NA,levy- I stress the term 'the imposition of a,69
NA,research levy' as distinct from the value,69
NA,of research or the allocation of research,69
NA,funds. I wish to say forcefully to the,69
NA,Minister that if there is evidence of wide- to Japan.,69
NA,spread opposition from the rank and file,69
NA,pig producers to the payment of the levy,69
NA,for research then a referendum should be,69
NA,held. But the Opposition has not received,69
NA,any factual evidence of widespread opposi-,69
NA,tion from pig producers to research or to,69
NA,levy as distinct from the distribution crr,69
NA,allocation of funds for research and the,69
NA,priorities for research.,69
NA,"I wish to make that clear, because when",69
NA,the Pig Committee of the Victorian,69
NA,Farmers Union first discussed the matter,69
NA,with us I must admit I was quite con-,69
NA,"cerned, as I thought there was widespread",69
NA,opposition to the levy from the commercial,69
NA,pig producers of Australia. I conferred at,69
NA,some length with members of the Opposi-,69
NA,tion and others to see if pig producers had,69
NA,come to Canberra and expressed their,69
NA,opposition to the levy. The Opposition will,69
NA,always move for referenda if it believes,69
NA,there is a case for them and particularly,69
NA,if there is controversy or opposition on a,69
NA,widespread basis or if it believes that the,69
NA,research is not in the best interests of the,69
NA,nation. I do not think that anybody in this,69
NA,Parliament or any of the pig producers,69
NA,argue that research is not warranted,69
NA,"at this point of time. However, the question",69
NA,is one of the evaluation of research. That,69
NA,is a different proposition.,69
NA,The Federal Pig Committee of the,69
NA,Victorian Farmers' Federation has,69
NA,expressed grave concern at the way research,69
NA,projects are frequently determined. Some,69
NA,criticism is made of the priorities and the,69
NA,benefits of particular research projects. As,69
NA,"T mentioned in thc debate on the last Bill,",69
NA,there is some validity in this concern. I,69
NA,believe that there should be an annual,69
NA,evaluation of research funds to see whether,69
NA,they are being used to achieve the optimum,69
NA,benefits for the industry and for the nation,69
NA,as a whole. The pig industry in Australia,69
NA,"has scope for expansion, but not as great",69
NA,widean expansion as many people would like.,69
NA,Some people believe that we have a great,69
NA,potential for increased pig production for,69
NA,export market. Before the war approxi-,69
NA,"mately 15,000 tons of pig meats were",69
NA,exported each year. At the end of the war,69
NA,"about 3,000 tons a year were exported.",69
NA,Since then there has been a slight surplus.,69
NA,In very recent years this has been increased,69
NA,to some degree with considerable exports,69
NA,The 2 major markets on the Continent-,69
NA,United Kingdom and the European,69
NA,Economic Community countries-ar e the,69
NA,"biggest importers of pig meats in the world,",69
NA,the but these 2 markets are the most difficult,69
NA,for Australia to break into. The United,69
NA,Kingdom imports principally cured pig,70
NA,"meats from Denmark, Poland and Ireland.",70
NA,The principal Common Market countries,70
NA,"which import pork are France, West Ger-",70
NA,many and Italy. These are supplied by the,70
NA,European Economic Community countries,70
NA,themselves. As we are now more familiar,70
NA,with the common agricultural policy of,70
NA,the European Economic Community we,70
NA,know that it is virtually a free trade area,70
NA,in itself with a huge protective barrier,70
NA,around it inhibiting imports from countries,70
NA,not in the Common Market. This makes,70
NA,it most difficult for Australia to break into,70
NA,"the 2 main traditional markets, the United",70
NA,Kingdom and Europe. It wilt be difficult,70
NA,to increase our exports to those 2 markets.,70
NA,The only other area which appears to offer,70
NA,prospects for increased exports of pig,70
NA,meats is Asia. One example is Hong Kong.,70
NA,We must realise that China is an,70
NA,important country as far as pig production,70
NA,is concerned. China has the capacity to,70
NA,swamp any Asian market of any conse-,70
NA,quence.,70
NA,Perhaps one of the best markets in the,70
NA,future will be Japan. If we handle the pig,70
NA,situation constructively Japan could,70
NA,emerge as a major importer of pig meats.,70
NA,The best market for pig meats is obviously,70
NA,our own domestic market. 1 would sound,70
NA,this note of warning about research into,70
NA,meats. There is a fairly stable aggregate,70
NA,demand for meat per capita. If one adds,70
NA,"together the total consumption of beef, veal,",70
NA,"mutton, lamb, poultry and pig meats one",70
NA,gets a fairly stable aggregate which is,70
NA,about 220 lbs of meat per annum. In the,70
NA,last 20 years or so the aggregate has varied,70
NA,around that figure. It is a fairly stable,70
NA,aggregate per capita per annum. Where the,70
NA,big change takes place is between meats.,70
NA,We have to be very careful about doing a,70
NA,lot of research and promotion in one of,70
NA,the meat industries. We could increase the,70
NA,"domestic consumption of, say, pig meats",70
NA,at the expense of other meats. One could,70
NA,"legitimately say: 'So what?' After all, pigs",70
NA,"are competing with beef, lamb and so forth.",70
NA,It might be a good thing to reduce the con-,70
NA,sumption of beef and increase the con-,70
NA,sumption of pig meats at a time when we,70
NA,could sell all our beef on the export,70
NA,market and therefore gain a greater amount,70
NA,of export earnings. There is some logic in,70
NA,that.,70
NA,I want to warn the Government that,70
NA,we have to be very careful in the pro-,70
NA,motion of meats. We are not going to,70
NA,get more people to eat more meat in the,70
NA,aggregate. It would simply mean that we,70
NA,would be spending a lot more money in,70
NA,the various research and promotion fields,70
NA,to get more people to change their dietary,70
NA,habits. One could then argue that it is a,70
NA,waste of resources simply to change from,70
NA,one to the other. The only people who,70
NA,would really benefit would be the adverti-,70
NA,sing companies. There has been a marked,70
NA,change in the dietary habits of Australians,70
NA,with respect to pig meats. In 1950 the,70
NA,consumption per head per annum of car-,70
NA,cass pig meats was approximately 7 Ibs At,70
NA,the present time it is about 20 Ibs. So there,70
NA,has been a significant increase in the'con-,70
NA,sumption per head and total consumption.,70
NA,"On the other hand, the compensating",70
NA,factor has been a fall in beef and veal,70
NA,consumption. In 1950 the consumption per,70
NA,head of beef and veal was 124 Ib. This,70
NA,has fallen to about 90 Ib per head. So,70
NA,there has been a marked increase in the,70
NA,consumption of pig meats and a marked,70
NA,decrease in the consumption of beef. As,70
NA,"I said before, there is nothing wrong with",70
NA,"this provided that we can sell all our beef,",70
NA,"which we have been able to do, and pro-",70
NA,vided that the export market is as good as,70
NA,the domestic market.,70
NA,It would seem that there is considerable,70
NA,"scope in Australia, however, for increased",70
NA,consumption of pig meats. 1 mentioned,70
NA,"before that, taking bacon into account, the",70
NA,total consumption of pig meat per head in,70
NA,Australia is 20 Ib to 25 Ib per annum.,70
NA,When we compare this with consumption,70
NA,"in the United States of America, which ""s",70
NA,"approximately 65 lb per head per annum,",70
NA,we see that there is considerable scope for,70
NA,an increase in the consumption of pig,70
NA,meats in Australia. In European countries,70
NA,the consumption is as high as 85 lb per,70
NA,head per annum. So if Australia follows the,70
NA,pattern of other developed countries such,70
NA,"as the United States, the United Kingdom",70
NA,"and the continental countries, we can ex-",70
NA,pect to see a steady increase in the con-,70
NA,sumption of pig meats in Australia. There,70
NA,are several factors which will bring this,70
NA,about. One relates to the dietary habits of,70
NA,people. Since the War we have had an in-,70
NA,"flux of migrants, who are perhaps more",70
NA,prone 10 eat pork than are Australians.,71
NA,There has been an increase in the quality,71
NA,of pig meat and more housewives are order-,71
NA,"ing and cooking roast pork, pork chops and",71
NA,so on. than before.,71
NA,Another factor is the price of feed grains.,71
NA,The pig industry is peculiar in that it is,71
NA,one of the few industries in Australia in,71
NA,which there has not been a significant,71
NA,increase in the cost of production because,71
NA,70 per cent to 80 per cent of the cash,71
NA,costs of production of pigs are feed costs.,71
NA,As there has been a tremendous change in,71
NA,"the pattern of production, from the tradi-",71
NA,tional by-products of the dairy industry to,71
NA,"grains, one sees that this is an industry",71
NA,in which considerable savings can be,71
NA,effected. It is one of the few industries in,71
NA,which there has not been a significant,71
NA,increase in costs of production because the,71
NA,price of feed grains has not increased at,71
NA,the same rate as the price of other feed,71
NA,stocks which contribute to the costs of,71
NA,production in other industries. Another,71
NA,factor affecting the consumption of pig,71
NA,meats is Australia is the lower price,71
NA,"relatively for skim milk. So, taken by and",71
NA,"large, there is a climate for a steady",71
NA,increase in the annual per capita consump-,71
NA,tion of pig meats in Australia.,71
NA,What types of pig research are needed?,71
NA,"The Victorian Farmers Union, whose",71
NA,"representatives saw us, has put forward",71
NA,some constructive views on the types of,71
NA,research that are needed and what priori-,71
NA,ties they should be given. But looking at,71
NA,the problem of ihe pig industry in Aus-,71
NA,tralia as a whole and what we know from,71
NA,"past experience, it is quite obvious that the",71
NA,productive efficiency of piggeries is rela-,71
NA,tively poor compared with overseas,71
NA,standards. Therefore we have those,71
NA,standards as a goal. This does not mean,71
NA,thai we will reach overnight the very high,71
NA,"standards of productive efficiency in, say,",71
NA,"Denmark, the Netherlands or parts of the",71
NA,"United States, but it does allow us to have",71
NA,a goal which we can aim to achieve over,71
NA,a period of time. Research work already,71
NA,shows that each sow has approximately,71
NA,1.5 litters annually. The number of pig-,71
NA,lets born each year can obviously be,71
NA,increased significantly.,71
NA,One of the most important avenues of,71
NA,fundamental and applied research in the pig,71
NA,industry is in regard to disease. I think,71
NA,Australia has made tremendous advances,71
NA,in this field in recent years. As I said be-,71
NA,"fore, there has been a marked change in",71
NA,the pattern of pig production in Australia.,71
NA,In fact 'pig' used to be a dirty word. We,71
NA,used to think of pigs being raised in a,71
NA,"pigsty, and the pigsty was regarded as a",71
NA,place to be avoided if possible. Today pigs,71
NA,are raised on grain in immaculately kept,71
NA,piggeries in some parts of Australia. In,71
NA,fact the mating and farrowing facilities for,71
NA,some pigs are better than the housing of,71
NA,some humans. This is good. After all why,71
NA,should they not have decent housing? As,71
NA,"has been shown in America, one of the",71
NA,most significant variables in relation to,71
NA,mortality is inefficient mating and farrow-,71
NA,ing facilities. I am. very pleased to see,71
NA,that the commercial pig owners are now,71
NA,devoting a great deal of attention to im-,71
NA,proving facilities for management and hus-,71
NA,bandry based on principles which they,71
NA,know to be correct because they have,71
NA,been proven in other countries as well as,71
NA,in Australia.,71
NA,There is a great need for research into,71
NA,"feeding. As I said before, 70 per cent to",71
NA,80 per cent of costs of pig meat produc-,71
NA,"tion are in the feeding. 1 was amazed,",71
NA,"when 1 studied in America, by the tremen-",71
NA,dous commercial efficiency of pig pro-,71
NA,ducers in the Mid-West. In fact most of,71
NA,their feeding programmes are worked out,71
NA,by computers. The best mixes and most of,71
NA,their profit variables in relation to those,71
NA,mixes are worked out by computers. The,71
NA,information is fed into the computers at,71
NA,the Universities of Iowa and Illinois. A,71
NA,farmer might ring up and say: 'What is the,71
NA,best mix to use under present prices?' He,71
NA,would get an answer within a matter of,71
NA,hours. It might include all the protein,71
NA,"values, whatever it might be, but those cost",71
NA,facilities were there. This illustrates that,71
NA,there is considerable scope for feeding,71
NA,research in Australia.,71
NA,Another avenue of research is breeding,71
NA,stock and culling. In the area of north,71
NA,Queensland that I represent there must be,71
NA,some of the worst pigs in Australia. Most,71
NA,of them seem to be half wild or wild pigs.,71
NA,In fact if a person wants to get a pig for,71
NA,his lunch he goes out into the bush and,71
NA,spends a few hours finding one and catch-,71
NA,ing it. I can tell honourable members that,71
NA,they are pretty tough to eat.,71
Mr SINCLAIR ,"A s Mrs Beeton says, first",72
NA,catch your hare.,72
Dr PATTERSON,Yes . Of course this,72
NA,is not the standard I am talking about when,72
NA,discussing this Bill. Certainly there has,72
NA,a great improvement in pig standards in,72
NA,recent years. Surely the principles that,72
NA,to animal husbandry in regard to cattle,72
NA,apply also to pig husbandry. We must have,72
NA,good breeding stock and sound animal,72
NA,husbandry principles in regard to culling.,72
NA,The objective is the same-t o get the,72
NA,maximum possible turnoff per annum. A,72
NA,man who can market 18 pigs per sow per,72
NA,year is financially better off than one who,72
NA,can market only 12.,72
NA,Mr Robinson-H e is doing pretty well.,72
Dr PATTERSON, 1 am quoting levels,72
NA,that have been achieved in Australia and,72
NA,Ttainly in other parts of the world. Maxi-,72
NA,mum turnoff and minimum mortality are,72
NA,"matters on whicb the research people,",72
NA,"under this Bill, will obviously give a lead",72
NA,been to the industry. My time is almost up. The,72
NA,Opposition will move the same amendments,72
NA,"apply and go through the same motions, though",72
NA,"perhaps for no* as long, with regard to",72
NA,penalties. Here we have exactly the same,72
NA,amendments regarding averment and the 5,72
NA,year provisions relating to the commence-,72
NA,ment of prosecutions.,72

NA,ourable member's question is as follows:,73
NA,U) and (2) ln the House on 24th September,73
NA,19h9 my predecessor as Minister for Trade and,73
NA,Industry said that 'there would be no precedent,73
NA,for the Minister responsible for the Tariff Board,73
NA,writing to the Board and instructing it or seeking,73
NA,to influence it'.,73
NA,Where the Government has considered i l neces-,73
NA,sary to inform the Tariff Board of a specific pol-,73
NA,icy objective when referring a particular industry,73
NA,to the Board this has been made clear in the,73
NA,terms of reference sent to the Board. In such,73
NA,cases thc Tariff Board has always taken the Gov-,73
NA,ernment's specific objectives into account.,73
NA,i ' i In iis rtcem Annual Reports the Tariff,73
NA,Board has suggested a progressive review of the,73
NA,tarifl and has described the approach it proposed,73
NA,to apply in considering whether an industry is,73
NA,economic and efficient and the level of tariff it,73
NA,would recommend.,73
NA,The Government has decided that there should,73
NA,be a progressive review of tbe tariff and that tbe,73
NA,principles to be observed by Ihe Tariff Board in,73
NA,"that review, and in its normal tariff reviews,",73
NA,should be the subject of further examination by,73
NA,the Government,73
NA,(Question No. 2132),73
NA,D r J. F. Cairns asked the Minister for,73
NA,"Trade and Industry, upon notice:",73
NA,(1) Has additional staff been sought by the,73
NA,Tariff Board.,73
NA,(2) Did the Pubhc Service Board recommend,73
NA,the creation of additional staff positions at the,73
NA,beginning of June 1970.,73
NA,(3) Was the Chairman of the Tariff Board,73
NA,informed that ihe matter raised important ques-,73
NA,tions whicb be should discuss with the Minister at,73
NA,the first opportunity.,73
NA,(4) Has the Tarifl Board stated that the,73
NA,resources available to it have been fully occupied,73
NA,"on normal tariff revision, dumping and New Zea-",73

NA,(5) Has he had discussions with the Minister,73
NA,for Customs and Excise about the additional staff,73
NA,"required by the Tariff Board; if not, why not.",73
NA,"(6) If he has had such discussions, what was",73
NA,the result.,73
NA,(7) Was the desire of the Tariif Board for more,73
NA,"staff considered to be a matter of policy; if so,",73
NA,why.,73
NA,(8) Is il a fact that the Government does not,73
NA,desire the Tariff Board to obtain more staff,73
NA,because of the possibility lhat i l may then pro-,73
NA,ceed with inquiries into high tariff areas and,73
NA,embarrass ihe Government by recommendations,73
NA,for reductions.,73
NA,(9) Has it been decided that this is tbe best,73
NA,way lo maintain independence of the Tariif Board,73
NA,whilst still avoiding problems of having to deal,73
NA,with any recommendations it may make for tarifl,73
NA,reductions.,73
NA,(10) When does he anticipate that the Tariff,73
NA,Board will have sufficient staff to complete the,73
NA,"inquiries envisaged in its reports for 1967-68,",73
NA,"1968-69, 1969-70 which are not yet completed or",73
NA,even begun.,73
Mr ANTHONY ,Th e answer to the hon-,73
NA,ourable member's question is as follows:,73
NA,"(1) During 1970, 38 additional positions were",73
NA,created in thc Office of the Tariff Board. Submis-,73
NA,sions seeking a further 20 positions were made,73
NA,towards the end of ihe year and these are under,73
NA,consideration by the Public Service Board.,73
NA,"(2) , (3), (7), (8) and (9) On 10th and 12th June",73
NA,"1970, the Public Service Board recommended the",73
NA,creation of a number of additional positions and,73
NA,approved the reclassification of a number of exist-,73
NA,ing positions. In respect of nine of the additional,73
NA,"positions, the Minister Assisting the Minister for",73
NA,Trade and Industry in response to a letter from,73
NA,the Chairman of the Tariff Board advised him,73
NA,that the conditions under which the Public Service,73
NA,Board recommended creation of these positions,73
NA,raised important policy questions which he would,73
NA,discuss with the Minister for Trade and Industry,73
NA,who had been overseas at that time. These nine,73
NA,Tariff Board additional positions were sought for work in con-,73
NA,nection with inquiries which would form part of,73
NA,a progressive review of the Tariff. At that time,73
NA,the question of whether there would be a progres-,73
NA,sive review of the Tariff was under consideration,73
NA,by the Minister. The additional nine positions,73
NA,were approved by the Governor-General-in-,73
NA,Council on llth September 1970. The Government,73
NA,has since decided that there should be a progres-,73
NA,sive review of the Tariff and that the principles to,73
NA,be applied by the Tariff Board in that review and,73
NA,in normal tariff inquiries would be the subject of,73
NA,further examination by the Government.,73
NA,(4) The Tariff Board stated in its Annual,73
NA,Report for 1969-70 that the resources available to,73
NA,it had been fully occupied on normal tariff revi-,73
NA,sion inquiries (including inquiries on some sec-,73
NA,tions of chapter 84 of the Tariff) and dumping,73
NA,and NZAFTA inquiries. The Board also stated in,73
NA,its 1969-70 Annual Report that the Minister had,73
NA,recently informed the Board that he expected a,73
NA,significant increase in the number of by-law,74
NA,dumping and NZAFTA matters referred to the,74
NA,Board.,74
NA,(S) and (6) Ministerial responsibility for the,74
NA,staffing of the Office of the Tariff Board rests,74
NA,with the Minister for Trade and Industry.,74
NA,(10) When the Tarifl Board considers lhat its,74
NA,"work load warrants additional staff resources, its",74
NA,requests are submitted to the Public Service Board,74
NA,for examination in the normal way.,74
NA,(Question No. 2133),74
NA,D r J. F . Cairns asked the Minister f o r,74
NA,Trade and Industry:,74
NA,(1) Did the Tariff Board in 1966-67 propose a,74
NA,progressive and systematic review of the tariff,74
NA,consisting of an internal examination by the,74
NA,Board of the structure and levels of protection in,74
NA,"the tariff, together with public inquiries into the",74
NA,main areas of production where there had been,74
NA,no recent public inquiry and where the levels of,74
NA,protection were in the medium to high range.,74
NA,"(2) I f so, what inquiries has the Board carried",74
NA,out as part of this progressive and systematic,74
NA,review and what public inquiries has the Board,74
NA,made into the main areas of production where,74
NA,there has been no recent public inquiry and where,74
NA,the levels of protection are in the medium to high,74
NA,range.,74
NA,"(3) Did the Board, in the same year, also",74
NA,propose a classification of industries into those,74
NA,"which have (a) a high level of protection, (b) a",74
NA,medium level of protection and (c) a low level of,74
NA,"protection, and state that it would not recommend",74
NA,protection for industries found to have little pros-,74
NA,pect of operating with an effective rate below SO,74
NA,"per cent and, in the case of industries requiring",74
NA,an effective rate exceeding 25 per cent but not,74
NA,"exceeding 50 per cent, it would be influenced by",74
NA,the likely effects on other industries and their,74
NA,prospects for more competitive production.,74
NA,"(4) If so, has the Board made this classification.",74
NA,(5) Has the Board (a) proceeded to inquire into,74
NA,"industries within this classification, (b) recom-",74
NA,mended that protection should not be given to,74
NA,industries found to have little prospect of operat-,74
NA,ing with an effective rate below 50 per cent and,74
NA,(c) recommended lhat protection should not be,74
NA,given in the case of industries requiring an effec-,74
NA,tive rate exceeding 25 per cent but not exceeding,74
NA,50 per cent where the Board has been influenced,74
NA,by the likely effects on other industries and their,74
NA,prospects for more competitive production.,74
NA,"(6) If so, what are, in each case, the industries",74
NA,for which the Board has not made recommen-,74
NA,dations for protection.,74
Mr ANTHONY ,Th e answers to the hon-,74
NA,ourable member's questions are as follows:,74
NA,(1) Yes.,74
NA,(2) In its Annual Report for 1966-67 the Board,74
NA,suggested that there would be advantages in con-,74
NA,ducting an inquiry into sections of Chapter 84 of,74
NA,the Tariff (which covers machinery and mechani-,74
NA,cal appliances). A summary list of the references,74
NA,under Chapter 84 since sent to the Board by the,74
NA,Minister is as follows:,74

NA,(3) In its Annual Report for 1966-67 the Tariff,74
NA,Board stated that it proposed to establish an ini-,74
NA,tial classification of industries into those which,74
NA,"have (a) a high level of protection, (b) a medium",74
NA,level of protection and (c) a low level of protec-,74
NA,tion in relation to the overall structure of assis-,74
NA,tance under which Australian import competing,74
NA,industries operate. In its Annual Report for 1967-,74
NA,68 the Board stated that in the case of areas of,74
NA,production which are found to have little prospect,74
NA,of operating with an effective rate below 50 per,74
NA,"cent, the Board would not recommend protection",74
NA,sufficient to allow the industries concerned to,74
NA,compete for resources on the same terms as low,74
NA,cost industries. In the same Report the Board,74
NA,also stated that in the case of activities requiring,74
NA,an effective rate of protection exceeding 25 per,74
NA,cent but not exceeding 50 per cent the Board,74
NA,would be influenced by the likely effects on other,74
NA,industries and their prospects for more competi-,74
NA,tive production.,74
NA,(4) In its Annual Report for the year 1967-68,74
NA,the Tariff Board presented a preliminary ranking,74
NA,of products according to height of ad valorem,74
NA,tarifl protection and in its Annual Report for the,74
NA,year 1969-70 gave a classification of industries,74
NA,according to average effective rates of protection.,74
NA,(5) and (6) With regard to the references,74
NA,"referred to in (2) above, reports have been tabled",74
NA,on:,74
NA,"Agricultural, horticultural and other machinery",74
NA,"and mechanical appliances, and parts therefor",74
NA,Gang slitting machines,74
NA,Centrifuges,74
NA,Weighing machinery and weights,74
NA,Extrusion presses,74
NA,In none of these reports has the Tarif) Board,74
NA,recommended that protection should not be given,74
NA,because the industry had little prospect of operat-,74
NA,"ing with an effective rate below 50 per cent, nor",74
NA,has there been any recommendation that protec-,74
NA,tion should not be given to an industry requiring,74
NA,an effective rate exceeding 25 per cent but not,74
NA,exceeding 50 per cent because of the likely effects,74
NA,on other industries and their prospects for more,74

NA,ourable member's question is as follows:,82
NA,(I) and (2) Are matters which are predomi-,82
NA,nantly administered by the relevant State authori-,82
NA,ties. Several Stales have attempted to control,82
NA,cropping rales by introducing licensing of shooters,82
NA,and kangaroo meat chillers.,82
NA,(3) The method is reliable both as a research,82
NA,tool and for the continuous monitoring of,82
NA,"kangaroo numbers. For the latter purpose, how-",82
NA,"ever, in a State management programme, it would",82
NA,be very expensive.,82
NA,"(4) In CSIRO, the method was used in a",82
NA,research programme to determine numbers and,82
NA,movements of kangaroos in specified areas in a,82
NA,variety of climatic regimes. The programme was,82
NA,terminated because its prime aim was achieved.,82
NA,(5) While studies by CSIRO and other bodies,82
NA,showed lhat kangaroo numbers were severely,82
NA,depleted in parts of the area in question as a,82
NA,result of the combined effects of prolonged,82
NA,"drought and expanded shooting, more recently",82
NA,there have been signs that kangaroos are increas-,82
NA,ing in number. Thc last meeting of the Australian,82
NA,"Fauna Authorities' Conference, comprising rep-",82

NA,The great majority of motor vehicle accidents,82
NA,in which Naval personnel are involved occur,82
NA,when they are travelling in privately owned vehi-,83
NA,cles and in their own time. Consequently there,83

NA,cumstances in which these accidents occur or of,83
NA,the contributing causes. These accidents are,83
NA,reported to the local police in accordance with,83
NA,local traffic law and included in the ordinary way,83
NA,in any relevant statistics compiled by the civil,83
NA,authorities. Convictions of naval personnel in the,83

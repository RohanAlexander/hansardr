Mr CHIFLEY ,Macquarie - Trea-,15
NA,surer) -Th e news of the death of,15
NA,"General Sir Harry Chauvel on Sunday,",15
NA,"the 4th March, will have been received",15
NA,by all members of the Commonwealth,15
NA,Parliament with very great sorrow. Sir,15
NA,"Harry was a distinguished soldier, and",15
NA,a great Australian. I f his greatness has,15
NA,not been fully appreciated by our genera-,15
NA,"tion, posterity certainly will acclaim him",15
NA,one of our Empire's great men. Born at,15
NA,"Tabulan, in northern New South ""Wales,",15
NA,"on the 16th April, 1865, he obtained, his",15
NA,early education at Toowoomba and,15
NA,Sydney Grammar .Schools. Selecting,15
NA,"a military career, he applied himself",15
NA,throughout his active soldiering days,15
NA,to mastering the profession of arms.,15
NA,"That he was successful, ,is indicated, by",15
NA,the history of his achievements.,15
NA,"When our defence force was in embryo,",15
NA,Harry Chauvel joined the New South,15
NA,"Wales Cavalry in 1886, the Queen's Own",15
NA,"Mounted Infantry i n 1890, and the Per-",15
NA,manent Forces ia 1896. He fought,15
NA,through the South African War from,15
NA,1899 to 1902 with the Queensland,15
NA,"Mounted Infantry, and later as com-",15
NA,"mander of a composite force of English,",15
NA,"Canadian, South African and Australian",15
NA,"horsemen known as "" Chauvel's Mounted",15
NA,"Infiantry"". For those services he was",15
NA,"created a C.M.G., and was granted a",15
NA,brevet rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. I n,15
NA,"1911, he became Adjutant-General of the",15
NA,"Australian Military Forces, and was",15
NA,Australian representative on the Imperial,15
NA,General Staff at the War Office in 1914.,15
NA,On the outbreak of the first Great War he,15
NA,was given command of the First Light,15
NA,"Horse Brigade in Egypt, and took i t to",15
NA,"Gallipoli, dismounted. There, again,",15
NA,Harry Chauvel demonstrated his capacity,15
NA,for leadership. During the most bitter,15
NA,"fighting of that campaign, he commanded",15
NA,the centre section of the Anzac defences;,15
NA,[21],15
NA,the command included his own brigade,15
NA,and the 4th Australian Infantry Brigade.,15
NA,"I n September, 1915, he commanded for",15
NA,a time the New Zealand and Australian,15
NA,"Division, and later the First Australian",15
NA,"Division, which formation he took back",15
NA,to Egypt. Throughout the Sinai cam-,15
NA,"paign, Harry Chauvel led the Anzac",15
NA,"Mounted Division, to which was attached",15
NA,"the Imperial Gamel Corps, and further",15
NA,distinguished himself in the battles at,15
NA,"Romani, Magdhaba and Gasa. Follow-",15
NA,"ing these battles, he was created a",15
NA,"K.C.M.G., as an "" immediate"" decora-",15
NA,tion- a very rare distinction. His com-,15
NA,mand-th e Desert Column-wa s enlarged,15
NA,"into the Desert Mounted Corps, and in",15
NA,"August, 1917, he was promoted to the",15
NA,"rank of Lieutenant-General, being the",15
NA,first Australian soldier to reach that rank.,15
NA,From among all the cavalry generals of,15
NA,"the British Empire, . Sir Harry Chauvel",15
NA,was selected to lead the largest force of,15
NA,mounted troops the modern world had,15
NA,known. His generalship at the battles,15
NA,"which followed, which brought about the",15
NA,destruction of the Turkish armies and,15
NA,culminated in the capture of Damascus,15
NA,"and Aleppo, and the capitulation of the",15
NA,"Turks, proclaimed to the world the genius",15
NA,of the man whose passing we now mourn.,15
NA,His awards during the 1914-18 war,15
NA,"earned him the O.B., K.C.M.G., K.C.B.,",15
NA,"G.C.M.G., Oroix de Guerre (France),",15
NA,Order of the Nile-thir d and second class,15
NA,-an d Mention in Despatches nine times.,15
NA,"Following the 1914-18 war, Sir Harry",15
NA,"Chauvel became Inspector-'General, and",15
NA,"later Chief o£ the General Staff, of the",15
NA,"Australian Military Forces, and was pro-",15
NA,moted to f u l l General in 1929. During,15
NA,"this time, and indeed for some years",15
NA,"afterwards, his vision and influence did",15
NA,much to build up the nucleus of the Army,15
NA,of which we are so proud to-day. Retire-,15
NA,ment from the Army in 1930 was not the,15
NA,end of Sir Harry's life work. Right up,15
NA,"to the time of his death, he held the",15
NA,appointment of Inspector-in-Chief of the,15
NA,"Volunteer Defence Corps. I n addition,",15
NA,he had actively engaged in pursuits of,15
NA,"a philanthropic nature, with a view to",15
NA,advancing the well-being of ex-service-,15
NA,"men, and promoting worthy objects",15
NA,in various spheres of community,15
NA,life. He pursued these activities,15
NA,"until only a few months ago, when his",15
NA,"declining health, aggravated :by an injury",16
NA,"sustained while riding, prevented his con-",16
NA,tinuance of them. The late general was,16
NA,accorded a State military funeral as a,16
NA,tribute to his outstanding public service.,16
NA,I n paying the respects of the House,16
NA,"to the memory of this great Australian,",16
NA,whose deeds and service had earned the,16
NA,"gratitude of our nation, and indeed, of",16
NA,"the Empire, I am sure that every honor-",16
NA,able member joins with me in extending,16
NA,the deepest sympathy to Lady Chauvel,16
NA,and her family. I move-,16
NA,That this House expresses its deep regret,16

NA,"capacity for decision, tlie force of characand",16
NA,ter and the strength of mind that must,16
NA,"have informed his military actions, he",16
NA,was in private life a man of the greatest,16

NA,"and of direct, honest and attractive",16
NA,"character. Indeed, although they were",16

NA,I add my -humble quota of appreciation,16
NA,of the services which that great man has,16
NA,"rendered to this young nation, and of the",16
NA,example which he -has set to those who,16

NA,the New South Wales branch of the new,16
NA,Liberal party has appointed Mr George,16
NA,I A. Wilson as its State organizer at a,16
NA,"salary of £2,000 .a year ? I n view of the",16
NA,fact that this gentleman is not a re-,16
NA,"soldier, will the Minister consider",16
NA,making provision in the preference-to-,16
NA,legislation that this position,16
NA,t shall be declared vacant so that the,16
NA,party will have to give preference,16
NA,to servicemen when filling any posi-,16
NA,of tions which are created in its new,16
Mr DEDMAN ,"Yes , I am aware",16
NA,"that the appointment has been made,",16
NA,had the position become vacant after,16
NA,the passing of certain legislation that is,16
NA,"to be brought jbef ore the House, i t would",16
NA,have been obligatory on the Liberal party,16
NA,to appoint an ex-serviceman. I cannot,16

NA,"can be made retrospective, but I shall",16
NA,meet give the matter consideration.,16
NA,PRICE OF MILK .,16
Mr ABBOTT ,Mor e than a fort-,16
NA,"night ago, I asked the Prime Minister,",16
NA,"on notice, to arrange for the holding of",16
NA,an independent inquiry into the cost to,16
NA,dairymen of producing milk i n the,16
NA,"Sydney and Newcastle zones, and I asked",16
NA,the price recommended by the,16
NA,authority appointed for this purpose be,16
NA,accepted by the Prices Commission as the,16
NA,are amount to be paid to dairymen. As,16
NA,"matter' is urgent, I ask the Acting",16
NA,of the House to see that the,16
NA,"shall be, i f possible, answered",16
Mr CHIFLEY , I shall arrange for,17
NA,"an answer to be given, as soon as possible.",17
NA,RAIL TRANSPORT.,17
NA,ACCOMMODATION FOR MEMBERS OF,17
NA,PARLIAMENT-RESTRICTION S ON INTER-,17
NA,STATE TRAVEL.,17
Mr BRYSON ,Whe n I was travel-,17
NA,ling from Melbourne to Canberra yester-,17
NA,day I was given a seat at Albury in,17
NA,an obsolete second-class railway carriage,17
NA,of the kind that is normally used for,17
NA,carrying passengers between intermediate,17
NA,stations. A bus capable of seating 36,17
NA,passengers was provided to carry four,17
NA,members of Parliament from Yass to,17
NA,"Canberra, and took two hours to make",17
NA,the journey of less than 40 miles. A,17
NA,private car was waiting for another,17
NA,member. I ask the Minister for Trans-,17
NA,port whether he can make immediate,17
NA,arrangements to provide a sleeping-car,17
NA,for the journey between Albury and,17
NA,"Canberra. I f not, will he arrange for",17
NA,some other suitable method of transport,17
NA,to replace the present one?,17
Mr WARD ,Mor e than one authority,17
NA,is involved in arranging transport to and,17
NA,"from Canberra. The State railways, as",17
NA,"the honorable memiber is aware, still",17
NA,remain under the direct administration,17
NA,of State authorities. The provision of,17
NA,a bus service between Yass and Canberra,17
NA,is the concern of the Minister for the,17
NA,Interior. As for the suggestion that sleep-,17
NA,ing cars be restored in order to suit the,17
NA,"convenience of members of Parliament,",17
NA,I regret that I cannot favorably con-,17
NA,sider any proposal for discriminating in,17
NA,favour of members of Parliament as,17
NA,compared with the general public.,17
NA,The question of the restoration of sleep-,17
NA,ing cars is to be considered at the next,17
NA,"meeting of the War Railway Committee,",17
NA,and it is hoped that arising out of its,17
NA,deliberations a decision to restore sleeping,17
NA,cars at an early date will be. made.,17
Mr SHEEHAN ,Ca n the Minister,17
NA,for Transport say whether the War Rail-,17
NA,way Committee at its forthcoming con-,17
NA,ference will give consideration to the,17
NA,lifting of restrictions on interstate rail,17
NA,"travel? I f not, will he arrange to have",17
NA,this matter placed on the committee's,17
NA,agenda?,17
Mr WARD ,Tha t matter is included,17
NA,"in the committee's agenda, and judging",17
NA,from the latest reports I am very hopeful,17
NA,that some of the restrictions will be lifted.,17
NA,QUESTIONS.,17
Mr HOLT ,Ha s the Acting Leader,17
NA,of the House any information to give to,17
NA,honorable members regarding press,17
NA,reports that the practice which has existed,17
NA,for many years in dealing with questions,17
NA,without notice is to be changed? Is it,17
NA,intended tbat the proposed change shall,17
NA,apply only to questions directed to the,17
NA,"Prime Minister, and, i f so, does the right",17
NA,honorable gentleman propose to nominate,17
NA,a deputy in this House to deal with,17
NA,matters concerning his own administra-,17
NA,tion when put to him by private members ?,17
NA,Can he say whether it is proposed to,17
NA,extend the new practice to Ministers,17
NA,other than the Prime Minister?,17
Mr CHIFLEY ,A s the result of,17
NA,what appears to be a growing practice of,17
NA,"asking, without notice, questions which",17
NA,are not of urgent public importance,17
Mr SPEAKER,Order ! The Chair,17
NA,at all times determines the importance,17
NA,and urgency of questions. I hope that,17
NA,the Treasurer is not reflecting on the,17
NA,Chair.,17
Mr CHIFLEY , I had no intention to,17
NA,"reflect on the Chair, Mr Speaker. I was",17
NA,merely expressing the Prime Minister's,17
NA,"opinion that some questions, without",17
NA,"notice, do not seem to him to be of urgent",17
NA,"public importance, and that the number",17
NA,of such questions is increasing.,17
Mr MENZIES , Questions without,17
NA,notice are not more numerous than they,17
NA,were ten years ago.,17
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! I cannot,17
NA,allow a debate on the subject.,17
Mr CHIFLEY ,Whe n Mr Bruce,17
NA,was Prime Minister he referred to this,17
NA,"matter in, I think, 1929. The Prime",17
NA,Minister proposes to give direct answers,17
NA,only to questions which are addressed to,17
NA,"him by party leaders in the House, and",17
NA,then only i f he is able to answer them,17
NA,with the information at his disposal.,17
Mr HOLT ,Ar e questions by private,17
NA,members to be addressed to a deputy of,17
NA,the Prime Minister?,17
Mr CHIFLEY ,"Generall y speaking,",17
NA,the Prime Minister's intention is to,17
NA,confine his answers to questions addressed,17
NA,to him by the leaders of the parties,18
NA,the House. As to questions addressed,18
NA,"private members to other Ministers,",18
NA,is hoped that i f they are of an urgent,18
NA,"character and can be answered readily,",18
NA,Ministers will continue to reply to,18
NA,I t is proposed to ask that long questions,18
NA,which obviously the Ministers to whom,18
NA,they are addressed cannot answer such,18
NA,off hand shall be placed on the noticeof,18
NA,paper.,18
Mr MENZIES ,Th e Prime Minister is,18
NA,also Minister for Defence. Should,18
NA,-private member desire to ask a question,18
NA,"touching the Department of Defence, to",18
NA,what Minister should he direct it?,18
Mr HOLT ,Th e Prime Minister also House?,18
NA,will deputize for the Minister for the,18
NA,Army during the absence of the latter,18
NA,from Australia.,18
Mr CHIFLEY ,Tha t is a matter to may,18
NA,"which I have not given much thought, to",18
NA,and I do not know the Prime Minister's lating,18
NA,views concerning it.,18
Mr SPENDER ," I ask you, Mr.",18
NA,"Speaker, whether it is competent for any",18
NA,Minister to state as a matter of practice,18
NA,that he will not answer any. questions,18
NA,in respect of a matter of public,18
NA,portance and urgency ? Is i t not for you,18
NA,to permit any private member to put any,18
NA,question on any matter of public,18
NA,urgency to a Minister? Can there,18
NA,any preclusion of that right?,18
Mr SPEAKER ,A n honorable mem-,18
NA,ber has the choice of asking a question,18
NA,"either orally or in writing, upon notice,",18
NA,"in his own way, provided always that forthwith.",18
NA,he keeps within the 'Standing Orders;,18
NA,and it then rests with the Minister,18
NA,whom the question is asked to decide ing a question?,18
NA,"whether he will answer it orally, or re-",18
NA,quire that notice of it be given. How-,18
NA,"ever, i t is a well-established practice,",18
NA,"for which they are many precedents,",18
NA,that a Minister need not answer any,18
NA,"question, and it is totally disorderly",18
NA,an honorable member to insist that,18
NA,given an answer.,18
NA,Later:,18

NA,in statement of the Acting Leader of,18
NA,"by the House, will you, Mr Speaker,",18
NA,it rule as to whether or not the Prime,18
NA,"Minister, or any other Minister,. has",18
NA,any power under the Standing Orders,18
NA,them. to refuse to accept a question that,18
NA,is put to him by an honorable,18
NA,"member? I f no such power exists, and",18
NA,a refusal would constitute a breach,18
NA,the Standing Orders and of the rights,18
NA,"and privileges of honorable members, will",18
NA,"you, as the custodian and guardian of",18
NA,"those rights and privileges, submit to the",18

NA,matter connected with the business on the,18
NA,"Notice Paper, of which such Members may",18
NA,have charge.,18
NA,I t will be noted that honorable members,18
NA,have the privilege of asking Ministers,18
NA,questions. The practice has been for a,18
NA,imMinister either to answer a question,18
NA,orally or to require its submission in writ-,18
NA,"ing, in order that a written reply may",18
NA,be made. I have already informed the,18
NA,be honorable member for Warringah that,18
NA,there is not the slightest doubt that,18
NA,although an honorable member is pri-,18

NA,I am pointing out to him that nothing,18
NA,which the Prime Minister or any other,18

NA,anti-Labour members from Queensland,20
NA,is that their suspense will not last very,20
NA,"long, because they all will disappear at",20
NA,next general elections.,20
NA,HOUSING.,20
Mr CONELAN , I ask the Minister,20
NA,representing the Acting Minister for the,20
NA,"Army whether,, in view of the housing",20
NA,"shortage in Queensland, he will take",20
NA,immediately to have private homes now,20
NA,occupied by Army base officers released,20
NA,immediately in order to relieve the he -belongs?,20
NA,position ?,20
Mr DEDMAN , I shall refer the,20
NA,matter to the Acting Minister for the,20
NA,Army.,20
NA,COMMONWEALTH GRANTS,20
NA,COMMISSION.,20
Mr GUY , I ask the Treasurer,20
NA,whether he has yet received a report from,20
NA,what is known as the caucus committee wool industry.,20
NA,appointed some time ago to investigate,20
NA,a claim made by the Government of report,20
NA,"Tasmania for an additional grant, and",20
NA,to inquire into the methods adopted,20
NA,the Commonwealth Grants Commission,20
NA,in calculating the grants to be,20
NA,the claimant States? I f the report ha3,20
NA,"been received, will he lay it upon the",20
NA,table of the House? I f it has not,20
NA,"received, when does he anticipate it will",20
NA,be made available to honorable members?,20
Mr CHIFLEY ,M y knowledge of Probably,20
NA,the matter is that the Government party,20
NA,appointed a committee of its members,20
NA,look into certain complains that were,20
NA,made regarding the calculation of,20
NA,State grants. I did not know that the,20
NA,complaint referred to any one particular,20
NA,State.,20
NA,Mr 'GUY -Th e whole committee,20
NA,visited Tasmania to investigate this,20
NA,matter.,20
Mr CHIFLEY ,"Probably , that wns",20
NA,on account of the Tasmanian climate.,20
NA,My impression is that the committee is,20
NA,to report generally to the party with re-,20
NA,spect to the commission's method of cal-,20
NA,culating grants to all of the claimant,20
NA,"States and not, in particular, to Tas-",20
NA,"mania. I -have not received the report,",20
NA,and I am unable to say when I am likely,20
NA,to receive it.,20
NA,TAXATION.,20
Mr FADDEN ,Wil l the Treasurer,20
NA,the announce to the House the tentative esti-,20
NA,mate which he has had prepared of the,20
NA,total and detailed expenditure from taxa-,20
NA,"tion receipts in 1947-48? I n future, will",20
NA,the honorable gentleman ensure that,20
NA,"figures of this kind, prepared at the ex-",20
NA,"pense of the Commonwealth, shall be",20
NA,steps made available publicly to taxpayers,20
NA,"generally, instead of being reserved for",20
NA,members of the political party to which-,20
Mr CHIFLEY , I shall examine the,20
NA,question asked by the right honorable,20
NA,"gentleman, and supply an answer later.",20
NA,"At this juncture, I merely remark that I",20
NA,have always been prepared to give to any,20
NA,honorable member any information that,20
NA,lie has sought from me.,20
Mr FADDEN ,Th e Treasurer did not,20
NA,make available the Jensen report on the,20
Mr SPEAKER,Order ! The Jensen,20
NA,is not the subject of the question.,20
Mr CHIFLEY , I said that I have,20
NA,by always been prepared to give to any,20
NA,honorable member any information,20
NA,made to that he has sought from me. I,20
NA,did not mention reports. I t is perfectly,20
NA,"true that, as Treasurer, when addressing",20
NA,been the Labour party on the Government's,20
NA,"proposals at various times, I have placed",20
NA,tentative estimates before the meeting.,20
NA,"every Minister,' regardless of",20
NA,"the party to which he belonged, has fol-",20
NA,to lowed that procedure from time to time.,20
NA,I do not make i t a general practice to,20
NA,supply to the House any document or,20
NA,statement that I make to the party.; but,21
NA,if an honorable member wants some par-,21
NA,"ticular information, I shall make it",21
NA,available to him.,21
Mr HUTCHINSON ,I n last Satur-,21
NA,day's press there appeared extracts from,21
NA,"a nnancial statement, which apparently",21
NA,is being circulated to members of the,21
NA,"Labour party, in which the Treasurer",21
NA,said that expenditure from taxa-,21
NA,"tion will reach £297,000,000 in 1947-48,",21
NA,unci that actual tax collections last,21
NA,"year amounted to only £269,000,000,",21
NA,"cr £2S,000,000 less than will be",21
NA,required two years from now. In,21
NA,view of the widespread interest and con-,21
NA,"cern which this statement has aroused,",21
NA,-and having regard to the faet that higb,21
NA,taxes are already seriously affecting,21
NA,"duction, and that the present high taxa-",21
NA,tion returns are influenced largely by,21
NA,"central bank credit expansion, does not",21
NA,that statement portend serious financial,21
NA,"difficulties in 1947-48, and indicate that",21
NA,the whole social service structure of this,21
NA,country has no real or satisfactory,21
NA,foundation ?,21
Mr CHIFLEY ,S o far as I can,21
NA,"gather, there are always many difficulties",21
NA,associated with finance. That is true of,21
NA,all governments and also of a great num-,21
NA,"ber of people. However, I see no danger",21
NA,to the foundation on which the social,21
NA,services of this country are being built,21
NA,by the Government. Social services can-,21
NA,not be provided unless somebody pays for,21
NA,them. The honorable member's question,21
NA,"is rather, a lengthy one and i f he",21
NA,"on the notice-paper, I shall answer it in",21
NA,greater detail.,21
NA,MIGRATION.,21
Mr WILSON , I ask the Ministertion,21
NA,re presenting the Minister for the I,21
NA,terior to inform me whether the Governmittee.,21
NA,ment has formulated a policy covering,21
NA,the admittance to Australia of migrants,21
NA,who desire to settle in this country? At,21
NA,"present, the door appears to have been",21
NA,"closed to such persons, and although",21
NA,many desirable people from Great,21
NA,Britain and elsewhere desire to make,21
NA,"their home in Australia, .all their efforts",21
NA,to obtain permits to land have been,21
NA,abortive.,21
Mr LAZZARINI, I shall bring the,21
NA,honorable member's question to the notice,21
NA,"of the Minister for the Interior, and ask",21
NA,him to supply an answer.,21
NA,CIVIL AVIATION.,21
NA,AIRCRAFT CRASH AT SPRING PLAINS-,21
NA,REPORT OF INTERDEPARTMENTAL COM -,21
NA,MITTEE.,21
Mr MCEWEN ,Wil l the Minister for,21
NA,Civil Aviation inform me whether the,21
NA,date has been fixed for the inquiry into,21
NA,"tbe recent disaster at Spring Plains,",21
NA,in which a Stinson aircraft was involved ?,21
NA,"I f so, what is the date ?",21
Mr DRAKEFORD ,Th e inquiry,21
NA,will commence on the 27th March. Some,21
NA,"pro- delay has heen caused, because Captain",21
NA,"Crowther, whom the Government in-",21
NA,tended to appoint to the inquiry as an,21
NA,"assessor, is not available, and another",21
NA,assessor had to be found. Captain,21
NA,Crowther is engaged on urgent work i n,21
NA,connexion with the Indian Ocean air,21
NA,route and therefore we cannot secure his,21
NA,"services. However, we have obtained as",21
NA,"an assessor Captain Jackson, who was the",21
NA,leading pilot in the service of W. R.,21
NA,Carpenter Airlines and has had wide,21
NA,experience.,21
Mr FRANCIS ,Havin g regard to the,21
NA,nation-wide anxiety as to the future of,21
NA,eivil aviation in Australiaj will the,21
NA,Minister for Civil Aviation lay on the,21
NA,table of the House the report of the inter-,21
NA,"departmental committee which, appar-",21
NA,"ently, the Government used recently in",21
NA,puts it arriving at certain decisions?,21
Mr DRAKEFORD , I have no know-,21
NA,"ledge of any nation-wide anxiety, but",21

Sir FREDERICK STEWART ,Wil l,21

NA,Medical Association for a supply of news-,21
NA,print for the purpose of enabling it to,21
NA,circulate its comments on the Govern-,22
NA,ment's pharmaceutical benefits legis-,22
NA,lation?,22
Mr BEASLEY ,Whe n a similar,22
NA,"question was asked recently, the Prime",22
NA,Minister gave a certain undertaking on,22
NA,"the matter. By this time, a decision",22
NA,"should have been reached, and I shall",22
NA,endeavour to ascertain from the Minister,22
NA,for Trade and Customs what has been,22
NA,done -Supply and Shipping to discuss the,22
NA,ALIEN DOCTORS.,22
Mr DALY ,Wil l the Minister,22
NA,senting the Minister for Health state how,22
NA,many alien doctoi-s were granted a licence,22
NA,tc practise in New South Wales under,22
NA,the Commonwealth Emergency Medical,22
NA,"Scheme, at the direction of the Medical",22
NA,Co-ordination Committee? What are the,22
NA,"names of these doctors, and where are",22
NA,they practising at present?,22
Mr HOLLOWAY , I shall obtain the,22
NA,information sought by the honorable,22
NA,member.,22
NA,F. VIGGERS LIMITED .,22
NA,Mr JAMEiS -I s it a fact that the,22
NA,"firm of F. Viggers Limited, which is",22
NA,"producing 3,000 gallons of oil and petrol",22
NA,"monthly from shale at Hamilton, near",22
NA,"Newcastle, has been served with a notice",22
NA,of eviction to take effect on the 1st,22
NA,"April ? I n view of the shortage of petrol, consider it.",22
NA,and in view of the fact that the,22
NA,Public Works Committee which,22
NA,been inquiring into the production of oil,22
NA,"from shale, has come to the conclusion",22
NA,"that this project has great possibilities,",22
NA,will the Minister representing the MinisMinister,22
NA,ter for Supply and Shipping state whether,22
NA,any action has been taken at the request,22
NA,of the committee to interview the Premier,22
NA,of New South Wales in order to prevent,22
NA,"any eviction? If; not, will the Governtralian",22
NA,ment issue a regulation to safeguard,22
NA,industry ?,22
Mr BEASLEY ,Th e honorable,22
NA,"gentleman's question was lengthy, but it",22
NA,missed the main point. I t did not indi-,22
NA,cate why the eviction was to be carried,22
NA,"out, or who was responsible for serving",22
NA,the notice.,22
Mr JAMES ,Th e City Council,22
NA,Newcastle is responsible. I t stated that,22
NA,the smell from the industry created,22
NA,nuisance.,22
Mr BEASLEY ,Tha t opens a much,22
NA,wider field. I t appears to be a matter,22
NA,affecting the by-laws of the Newcastle,22
NA,City Council. I am aware of the impor-,22
NA,"tance of extracting oil from shale, and I",22
NA,believe that all honorable members are,22
NA,aware of the enormous sums of money,22
NA,that the Commonwealth is expending on a,22
NA,development of that character at Glen,22
NA,Davis. I shall ask the Minister for,22
NA,matter with the Premier of New South,22
NA,"Wales, and to make representations to",22
NA,reprethe City Council of Newcastle.,22
NA,SHORTAGE OF NURSES.,22
Mr CONELAN ,I n view of the,22
NA,favorable war situation and the acute,22
NA,shortage of nursing sisters in Australian,22
NA,"hospitals, will the Minister representing",22
NA,the Minister for the Army give favorable,22
NA,consideration to the release of nursing,22
NA,sisters from the Army in order to augment,22
NA,the staffs of civil hospitals?,22
Mr DEDMAN , I was under the im-,22
NA,pression that this matter had been dealt,22
NA,with by a committee representing the,22
NA,Department of the Army and the Depart-,22
NA,ments of Health and Social Services.,22
NA,"However, I shall refer the honorable",22
NA,member's representation to the Acting,22
NA,"Minister for the Army, and ask him to",22
NA,has ROYAL AUSTRALIA NAIR FORCE.,22
NA,EQUIPMENT.,22
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,Ha s the,22
NA,for Air had an opportunity to,22
NA,study the remarks of Air Vice-Marshal,22
NA,Jones at the meeting of the' Air Force,22
NA,"Association held in Adelaide, regarding",22
NA,lack of equipment for the Royal Aus-,22
NA,"Air Force ? I f so, will the honor-",22
NA,the able gentleman say whether or not the,22
NA,views expressed are a reflection of those,22
NA,held by the Government? Has he any,22
NA,comment to make in regard to them?,22
Mr DRAKEFORD , I have read in,22
NA,various newspapers a number of reports,22
NA,of the remarks of Air Vice-Marshal,22
NA,"Jones, and each differs from the others.",22
NA,of I have taken steps to verify their,22
NA,correctness or otherwise. When this has,22
NA,"a been determined,, I shall study the",22
NA,matter further.,22
NA,WHEAT INDUSTRY.,23
Mr WILSON , I ask the Minister,23
NA,for Commerce and Agriculture whether,23
NA,the proposed first advance of 4s. 3d. a,23
NA,bushel for wheat is to be regarded as,23
NA,inclusive or exclusive of the l i d .,23
NA,agreed upon as an additional payment for,23
NA,"labour. Secondly, as the indications in",23
NA,respect of future sales of wheat are that,23
NA,a price considerably in excess of 4s. 3d. a,23
NA,"bushel will be realized, will the honorable",23
NA,gentleman consider a straight-out advance,23
NA,payment of 5s. a bushel for the next,23
NA,harvest?,23
Mr SCULLY ,Th e 4s. 3d. a bushel,23
NA,is to be only the first advance. The,23
NA,direct payment is a matter for future,23
NA,consideration. The honorable member,23
NA,may rest assured that the pool will be,23
NA,wound up quickly. Perhaps the ultimate,23
NA,realization will exceed the price he has,23
NA,suggested.,23
NA,TEXTILE S AND CLOTHING.,23
NA,CIVILIAN SUPPLIES-DOUBLE-WEF T,23
NA,CLOTH: EXPOET TO NEW ZEALAND.,23
Mr BERNARD CORSER ,Wil l the,23
NA,Minister representing the Minister for,23
NA,Supply and 'Shipping explain the reason,23
NA,for the severe shortage of textiles and,23
NA,"clothing for civilian use, despite the fact",23
NA,that i t has been found necessary to,23
NA,appoint a Manufacturers Advisory Comsay,23
NA,mittee to assist the War Disposals Comtions,23
NA,mission in the clearing of surplus stocks,23
NA,of those goods?,23
Mr BEASLEY ,"Upo n reflection, the",23
NA,honorable member will note that it is,23
NA,quite possible that stocks of textiles,23
NA,clothing acquired for the use of. the,23
NA,"the Army, and the Air Eorce may be",23
NA,greater than the requirements. He will information.,23
NA,appreciate that the depletion of the,23
NA,stocks is governed by operational needs.,23
NA,"This applies also, to munitions. Surplus",23
NA,stock of that character would become,23
NA,useless if held too long.,23
Mr BERNARD CORSER ,Ther e is,23
NA,evidence that they are defence stocks.,23
Mr BEASLEY ,Th e object in conthe,23
NA,stituting the War Disposals Commission,23
NA,was to clear surplus defence stocks;,23
NA,"therefore, the honorable member may",23
NA,take it for granted that these come within,23
NA,that category. The position generally is,23
NA,"easing considerably, and the public will",23
NA,be satisfied when it realizes what progress,23
NA,is being made.,23
Mr CONELAN ,I s the Minister,23
NA,representing the Minister for Supply,23
NA,a bushel and Shipping aware that textiles,23
NA,"made in Australia, and exported to New",23
NA,"Zealand, are being sold there as having",23
NA,been made in England? Will he take,23
NA,steps to see that those materials are,23
NA,"branded "" Made in Australia "" ?",23
Mr BEASLEY , I am surprised to,23
NA,"hear that that is being done, because",23
NA,double weft cloth has been manufac-,23
NA,tured in Australia for the very purpose,23
NA,of supplying the New Zealand market.,23
NA,I do not attempt to hide that fact.,23
NA,I t would have been the duty of any,23
NA,government to endeavour to secure,23
NA,"that export trade, and double weft",23
NA,cloth was made for New Zealand when,23
NA,people in our own country were not,23
NA,being supplied with it. I f the goods,23
NA,are being sold as having been made in,23
NA,"England, I think that the suggestion that",23
NA,"they should be branded "" Made in Aus-",23
NA,"tralia "" is a wise one, and should be",23
NA,ad'opted.,23
NA,SYDNEY GRAVING DOCK.,23
Mr SHEEHAN , W i l l the Minister,23
NA,representing the Minister for the Interior,23
NA,who is responsible for issuing invita-,23
NA,to attend the opening of the Sydney,23
NA,graving dock? - Have invitations been,23
NA,issued to representatives of the em-,23
NA,ployees? Have arrangements been made,23
NA,to prevent an occurrence similar to that,23
NA,and in which Captain de Groot figured at the,23
NA,"Navy, opening of the Sydney harbour bridge?",23
Mr LAZZARINI , I shall obtain the,23
NA,POSTAL DEPARTMENT.,23
Mr MARTENS , I received to-day,23
NA,from Home H i l l a telegram protesting,23
NA,against the refusal of the Postmaster-,23
NA,no General's Department to take mail,23
NA,"matter across a river in a boat, with",23
NA,result that a letter posted at,23
NA,"Home H i l l for delivery at Ayr, 6",23
NA,"miles distant, had to go through Rock-",23
NA,"hampton and Winton, the total distance",23
NA,"covered being between 1,400 and 1,500",23
NA,miles. Will the Minister representing the,23
NA,Postmaster-General give the reason for,24
NA,this departure from the usual practice in,24
NA,similar circumstances?,24
NA,"M""r. CALWELL - I shall bring the",24
NA,complaint to the notice of the Postmaster-,24
NA,"General, and shall ask him to give urgent",24
NA,and sympathetic consideration to it.,24
NA,SEED OATS.,24
Mr ADERMANN , I ask the Minis-,24
NA,ter for Commerce and Agriculture,24
NA,whether or not there are any seed oats in,24
NA,"Western Australia. I f there are, will the",24
NA,Government make transport available,24
NA,"immediately, in order that the seed may",24
NA,be brought to the eastern States; or,24
NA,dairying industry to understand definitely,24
NA,"that no seed is to be made available, and",24
NA,that the Government does not regard the,24
NA,growing of fodder for dairy cattle as of,24
NA,any consequence?,24
Mr SCULLY ,I t is a reflection on,24
NA,the Government to suggest that it does,24
NA,not desire the growing of feed for dairy,24
NA,stock; that is most essential.,24
NA,information supplied by the Minister for,24
NA,Agriculture in Western Australia is that,24
NA,there is only a limited quantity of oats,24
NA,in that State. Everything possible is,24
NA,being done to have oats brought,24
NA,eastern States for all essential purposes;,24
NA,this seed has even been given priority,24
NA,over wheat. The honorable gentleman,24
NA,may rest assured that the Government FEASEB-,24
NA,has explored every avenue in its attempts,24
NA,"to secure seed, the importance of which",24
NA,it recognizes fully.,24
NA,PILLAGING.,24
Mr ANTHONY ,Wil l the Minister,24
NA,for Supply and Shipping inform the,24
NA,House whether he has read a report from,24
NA,Lae by Brigadier Pascoe to the effect,24
NA,"that, of 2,000 cases of beer consigned to",24
NA,"troops in that area at Christmas time,",24
NA,over 400 cases were pillaged at Sydney?,24
NA,"I f not, will he scrutinize the report, and",24
NA,lay it on the table of the House? Has,24
NA,the Minister also received a report that,24
NA,Red Cross supplies of orange juice and,24
NA,other goods directed to troops in that,24
NA,"area were similarly pillaged, as were",24
NA,also Red Cross hygiene supplies for,24
NA,nurses? What action does the Govern-,24
NA,ment propose to take to put an end to,24
NA,these depredations on goods and com-,24
NA,"forts consigned to the troops, in the",24
NA,fighting areas?,24
Mr BEASLEY ,Nobod y with any,24
NA,national pride or spirit could be other,24
NA,than disgusted at the pillaging that has,24
NA,"occurred in some ports of Australia,, and",24
NA,"in other ports throughout the world, of",24
NA,goods destined for the fighting forces. I,24
NA,am sure that there is no difference of,24
NA,"opinion between us on this matter, be-",24
NA,cause no person could stoop to a more,24
NA,despicable action than that referred to;,24
NA,"but, unfortunately, pillaging is rife. The",24
NA,Government originally set aside a sum,24
NA,"of about £200,000 for the purpose of",24
NA,is the building up an organization on the,24
NA,"waterfront to meet this problem, but",24
NA,"unfortunately, the trouble is not con-",24
NA,fined to pillaging on the water-,24
NA,f.ront. The origin of the evil is far,24
NA,behind the waterfront. The Government,24
NA,believes that goods are pillaged long,24
NA,before they reach the ships' sides. 1,24
NA,do not blame the wharfi labourers alone,24
NA,for what has occurred. I hope that we,24
NA,The shall soon be able to root out those,24
NA,"responsible for the evil, and expose them",24
NA,to the world at large.,24
NA,to the GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH.,24
NA,ADDKESS-IN-REPLY.,24
NA,Debate resumed from the 9th March,24
NA,"(vide page 546), on motion by Mr.",24
NA,That the following Address-in-Reply to His,24
NA,Royal Highness the Governor-General s Speech,24
NA,be agreed to:-,24
NA,MAY IT PLEASE YOUB ROYAL HIGHNESS :,24
NA,"We, the House of Representatives of the",24
NA,"Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia,",24
NA,"in Parliament assembled, desire to express",24
NA,"our loyalty to our most Gracious Sovereign,",24
NA,to extend to Your Royal Highness a welcome,24
NA,"to Australia, and to thank Your Royal High-",24
NA,ness for the Speech which you have been,24
NA,pleased to address to Parliament.,24
Mr SMITH ,Wakefield) [3.0] - I asso-,24
NA,ciate myself with the sentiments that have,24
NA,been expressed by honorable members,24
NA,regarding the appointment of His Royal,24
NA,Highness the Duke of Gloucester as,24
NA,Governor-General of the Commonwealth.,24
NA,I appreciate the fact that a Labour Go-,24
NA,vernment has shown in a practical way,24
NA,its loyalty to the British Throne by the,24
NA,appointment to that high office of a,24
NA,"brother of His Majesty the King. This,",24
NA,"Mr Speaker, gives tlie lie direct to those",25
NA,who have been loud in their criticism of,25
NA,the Labour party i n saying that its mem-,25
NA,bers are not loyal subjects of the K i n g .,25
NA,I feel sure that this appointment proves,25
NA,"beyond doubt that we are, and always",25
NA,"have been, as loyal as any other body,",25
NA,"and perhaps more loyal than some. I ,",25
NA,in common with other honorable members,25
NA,"of the House, trust that the term of office",25
NA,of His Eoyal Highness w i l l be a most,25
NA,"pleasant one, and I feel sure that i t w i l l",25
NA,bo. The Prime Minister ( Mr Curtin),25
NA,"rightly said, at the parliamentary dinner",25
NA,"tendered to the Governor-General, that i t",25
NA,"was a family gathering, meaning, I take",25
NA,"it, that f r o m now on we should regard",25
NA,His Eoyal Highness as one of ourselves.,25
NA,I am sure that he will feel as much at,25
NA,home with us as we shall be w i th h i m .,25
NA,I trust that his wish fo r world peace to be,25
NA,restored during his stay amongst us w i l l,25
NA,be realized.,25
NA,I express my pleasure at the fact that,25
NA,the Prime Minister has been able to take,25
NA,up his important duties again. I trust,25
NA,that his health w i l l remain sufficiently,25
NA,robust to enable h i m to continue his excel-,25
NA,lent leadership of this country. I am,25
NA,sorry to hear that at present he is slightly,25
NA,"indisposed, but I am. pleased to know",25
NA,that he is not seriously i l l . I hope the,25
NA,people realize the tremendous responsi-,25
NA,bility which he has had to shoulder dur-,25
NA,ing the trying years i n which he has been,25
NA,in office. No doubt his onerous duties,25
NA,its Prime Minister have been the greatest,25
NA,contributing factor to the undermining,25
NA,"of his health. I wonder sometimes, when",25
NA,hearing certain criticism of the Govern-,25
NA,"ment, whether the people f u l l y realize tlie",25
NA,true value of the work which the present,25
NA,Ministry has done during the greatest,25
NA,crisis i n the world's history. The job i3,25
NA,"not yet finished, but, when listening to",25
NA,"the remarks of some honorable members,",25
NA,one would imagine that the war was a,25
NA,secondary matter. They ask for the,25
NA,"transfer of man-power, speak of a wastage",25
NA,"of man-power, and allege that too many",25
NA,men are i n the fighting forces. They,25
NA,say that many of those men could be,25
NA,employed more profitably i n other direc-,25
NA,"tions. That, of course, would be a fact",25
NA,if we could direct the operations of the,25
NA,enemy.,25
NA,When I was passing a fire brigade,25
NA,"station a few days ago, I saw men stand-",25
NA,"ing around seemingly with, nothing to do.",25
NA,But would any honorable member con-,25
NA,tend that the brigade should be disbanded,25
NA,because of that fact? Of course not. A,25
NA,similar position arises with regard to the,25
NA,fighting forces. The Prime Minister,25
NA,rightly pointed out that the disposition,25
NA,and use of Australia's fighting forces have,25
NA,been agreed to by the H i g h Command.,25
NA,Surely that position could not be i m -,25
NA,proved upon. Certainly we i n this,25
NA,"chamber, not knowing all of the facts, are",25
NA,not competent to pass judgment as to,25
NA,whether the best use is being made of,25
NA,those forces. Some honorable members,25
NA,"have had the audacity to do so, but only",25
NA,for the purpose of furthering their own,25
NA,political ends. I n that respect they are,25
NA,prepared to play the game of politics,25
NA,pretty low. The Leader of tlie Opposi-,25
NA,"tion ( Mr Menzies), speaking i n this",25
NA,debate of the operations upon which the,25
NA,Australian forces were engaged i n the,25
NA,"Pacific Islands, said-",25
NA,Tlie role allotted to the Australian forces,25
NA,since the drive began is the secondary role of,25
NA,"mopping up by-passed areas which, as I under-",25
NA,"stand it, cannot be regarded any longer as of",25
NA,primary military moment.,25
NA,The honorable member for Flinders,25
NA,( Mr Ryan) is recorded i n Hansard as,25
NA,having said-,25
NA,I do not forget these things when I say that,25
NA,Australian troops have been relegated to the,25
NA,"role of charwoman of the Pacific, mopping up",25
NA,the mess left behind as the front oi battle,25
NA,moved forward.,25
NA,"Very properly, the members of our forces",25
NA,who have returned f r o m the north have,25
NA,taken exception to statements of that,25
NA,kind. I n the Melbourne Herald of the,25
NA,"8th of this month, the following",25
NA,appeared:-,25
NA,Thirty walking wounded Army and Air,25
NA,"Force men, who returned by flying boat from",25
NA,"the islands, ridiculed recent public statements",25
NA,that Australian military operations were con-,25
NA,fined to mopping up.,25
NA,"""Nothing made us more mad than to get",25
NA,reports from home saying we have been rele-,25
NA,"gated to mopping-up operations"", said one",25
NA,"of the soldiers. "" I would like to organize",25
NA,a patrol of politicians who have been making,25
NA,"these statements.""",25
NA,'Such statements were made i n this House,25
NA,for one reason only. I am certain that,25
NA,"those who made them, did not intend to",25
NA,"reflect on our forces, but they were using",25
NA,them for political ends. Unfortunately,26
NA,"for them, their statements have rebounded",26
NA,to their own political disadvantage.,26
NA,"""When this was brought to the attention",26
NA,"of the Leader of the Opposition, he",26
NA,said-,26
NA,The point that we have made is that this,26
NA,appears to he a secondary i-ole.,26
NA,That qualification was not used when the,26
NA,original statement was made. I t is only,26
NA,"natural that our soldiers, who are doing",26
NA,"such a wonderful job in the north, should",26
NA,take exception to remarks of the kind,26
NA,which I have quoted.,26
NA,Members of the Opposition are very,26
NA,fond of recalling tbe result of the recent,26
NA,referendum for the enlargement of Com-,26
NA,monwealth powers. The spate of propa-,26
NA,ganda released during the referendum,26
NA,campaign by those who objected to the,26
NA,Government's proposals appealed to the,26
NA,"selfishness and fear of the people, who",26
NA,"were war-weary, and had become tired of",26
NA,regulations. They were led to believe,26
NA,that if they voted against the referendum,26
NA,"proposals, they could, and would, get rid",26
NA,of war-time controls almost immediately.,26
NA,"As a matter of fact, war-time controls",26
NA,were imposed and kept in operation for,26
NA,"the benefit of the (people, and I",26
NA,am convinced that they will eventually,26
NA,"realize that fact. Of course, mistakes",26
NA,"were made, and it is probable that more",26
NA,will be made in the future. Perhaps,26
NA,officers did not always discharge their,26
NA,"duties in a way to inspire confidence, but,",26
NA,"for the most part, they have done a diffi-",26
NA,cult job well. We have not had to go,26
NA,without any essential commodity. In the,26
NA,"course of my travels, I have seen no one",26
NA,"who was cold or hungry. Indeed, never",26
NA,"have I, in all my experience, seen the",26
NA,"people so prosperous, and my memory",26
NA,"goes back over a good many years, during",26
NA,which time I have seen many ups and,26
NA,downs in Australia. When I read letters,26
NA,"from people in England and Scotland,",26
NA,where they have to go without the most,26
NA,"necessary things, while at the same time",26
NA,being subjected to the danger of bomb-,26
NA,"ing, I realize that we in this country",26
NA,"should, in the words of the Prime Minis-",26
NA,"ter, go down on our knees and thank God",26
NA,"that, in the main, we have been spared",26
NA,"thus far. This is due, first, to the sacri-",26
NA,"fice of the Mother Country, and then to",26
NA,the timely assistance given to Australia,26
NA,Mr Smith.,26
NA,by the United States of America. I well,26
NA,remember that when the Prime Minister,26
NA,took action to obtain assistance from the,26
NA,"United States of America, there was an",26
NA,outcry from a certain class of person in,26
NA,Australia that the Labour Government,26
NA,"was disloyal, and that the Prime Minister",26
NA,was slighting the Mother Country. At,26
NA,"that time, the Prime Minister knew per-",26
NA,"fectly well that Great Britain, which was",26
NA,undergoing a terrible ordeal in fighting,26
NA,"the battle for world freedom, could not",26
NA,"help us. Therefore, he appealed to the",26
NA,"United States of America, which came to",26
NA,our aid. When our men came back from,26
NA,"the Middle East, I watched company",26
NA,after company marching through the,26
NA,"streets of Adelaide, and I remember the",26
NA,feeling of security which the spectacle,26
NA,gave to the public. As the Prime Min-,26
NA,"ister said, Australia was saved by the",26
NA,help of Great Britain and of the United,26
NA,"States of America, and by the sacrifice",26
NA,"of our own gallant men, who placed their",26
NA,bodies between us and the enemy. We,26
NA,can never thank those men enough for,26
NA,what they did for us and for civilization.,26
NA,I have heard people use the phrase,26
NA,""" equality of sacrifice "". There can be",26
NA,no sacrifice equal to that made by men,26
NA,who give their lives. That is the,26
NA,supreme sacrifice.,26
NA,Last week honorable members had the,26
NA,privilege of hearing the Minister for the,26
NA,Navy ( Mr Makin) give an account of,26
NA,"what one unit of the "" silent service""",26
NA,had done in this war. What a record,26
NA,of gallantry on the ipart of men who go,26
NA,down to the sea in ships! Their deeds,26
NA,and their names will live in history.,26
NA,Those men gave their all-thei r lives.,26
NA,"In view of all the circumstances, it is",26
NA,clear that the regulations which have,26
NA,"been promulgated, and the restrictions",26
NA,which the Government in its wisdom has,26
NA,"seen fit to impose, have been for the",26
NA,preservation of the people of Australia,26
NA,"and the good of the nation; and,",26
NA,"accordingly, we should accept them un-",26
NA,"complainingly, and do all that we can",26
NA,"to carry them out. I n this connexion,",26
NA,the press could play a helpful part. The,26
NA,newspapers of this country could be a,26
NA,powerful factor in maintaining the,26
NA,"morale of the people, but I fear that",26
NA,they have not been so helpful as they,26
NA,"might have been. Take, for instance,",26
NA,newspaper references to troubles i n tbe,27
NA,coal-mining industry. Every day we,27
NA,read bow much coal has ibeen lost because,27
NA,"of actions of the coal-miners, and",27
NA,the public gets the impression that these,27
NA,men are intent on sabotaging .the war,27
NA,effort. One honorable member said i n,27
NA,this House that coal-miners who would,27
NA,not work should be taken f r o m the mines,27
NA,and put i n the f r o n t line; i n other,27
NA,"words, that they should be short. M y",27
NA,experience as an employee and as an,27
NA,employer convinces me that that is not,27
NA,"the way ,to get the best out of men.",27
NA,"Goal-mining is not attractive work, and",27
NA,"in the main, the coal-miners of this",27
NA,country have done well. Like other,27
NA,"people, they are much more likely to",27
NA,give their best when they are encouraged,27
NA,and given credit for the services that,27
NA,they have rendered. A t various times,27
NA,the Premier of South Australia has said,27
NA,"that, unless more coal were provided,",27
NA,train services would have to be curtailed,27
NA,and restrictions imposed on the use of,27
NA,"electric light and power, and f r o m time",27
NA,to time the dwindling stocks of coal have,27
NA,been featured i n the newspapers of that,27
NA,"State. Nevertheless, train services have",27
NA,"been maintained, and there have been",27
NA,no restrictions on the use of electricity,27
NA,for domestic purposes. The needs of the,27
NA,people have been met. Propaganda of,27
NA,that kind is not i n the best interests,27
NA,an all-in war effort.,27
NA,I listened with interest to the speech,27
NA,of the right honorable memiber f o r Cow-,27
NA,"per ( Sir Earle Page), i n which he ex-",27
NA,pressed his ideas concerning the need,27
NA,for water conservation. I agree w i th,27
NA,him that something of that kind,27
NA,"should be done, but, fo r the most",27
NA,"part, he referred to projects within the",27
NA,"sphere of the States-work s which, as he",27
NA,"well knows, the Commonwealth Govern-",27
NA,ment has no power to undertake. To,27
NA,the uninitiated the proposals of the right,27
NA,"honorable gentleman may sound all right,",27
NA,hut those who know how he opposed the,27
NA,granting of further powers to the Com-,27
NA,monwealth realize that his speech was,27
NA,"merely so much "" kite-flying"".",27
NA,right honorable gentleman also men-,27
NA,"tioned housing needs, but what did the",27
NA,"Government of which he was a member,",27
NA,and other governments which he sup-,27
NA,"ported, do to supply the needs when",27
NA,labour and material were available i n,27
NA,abundance? 'Can he say how many,27
NA,houses were built under the Common-,27
NA,wealth housing scheme ? Although many,27
NA,national works could have been under-,27
NA,"taken i n those years, nothing was done;",27
NA,previous governments preferred to give,27
NA,men the dole rather than opportunities,27
NA,to work.,27
NA,The right honorable gentleman and,27
NA,other honorable members opposite advo-,27
NA,cate an active immigration policy; their,27
NA,"slogan is, "" Populate or perish"". I",27
NA,agree that Australia needs a much larger,27
NA,"population, but something more than the",27
NA,policy which has been followed i n the,27
NA,past is necessary to that end. As I,27
NA,have passed through country towns and,27
NA,villages I have missed many once-,27
NA,"thriving industries; they no longer exist,",27
NA,because those who control industry find,27
NA,"it, cheaper to concentrate their businesses",27
NA,"in the metropolitan areas. "" B i g busi-",27
NA,"ness "" has crushed out competition, and",27
NA,the result is seen in deserted country,27
NA,"towns and villages. I n the past, many",27
NA,primary .producers have not been able,27
NA,to pay their way. I t has taken a war,27
NA,and a Labour government to give some,27
NA,stability to primary production. I am,27
NA,reminded of what the honorable member,27
NA,for I n d i ( Mr MCEwen) once said when,27
NA,of he was a Minister in a former govern-,27
NA,ment-,27
NA,Australia could not afford to {guarantee,27
NA,"more tlian 3s. ]0d. a bushel f.o.b., which,",27
NA,"on the basis of guaranteed .production, is",27
NA,equal to approximately 3s. a bushel at sidings.,27
NA,He went on to say that a war expendi-,27
NA,"ture of £70,000,000 would not permit i t .",27
NA,"To-day, war expenditure is at the rate, of",27
NA,"over £400,000,000 a year. The present",27
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies),27
NA,"visited Adelaide i n September, 1939,",27
NA,"when he was Prime Minister, and was",27
NA,reported i n the Adelaide Advertiser as,27
NA,having said-,27
NA,"With £32,000,000 needed for defence, I can-",27
NA,not see how I am goinig to raise money for,27
NA,"the wheat -industry, either by loan or from",27
NA,revenue.,27
NA,The The present Leader of the Opposition,27
NA,"in the 'Senate, Senator MCLeay, when",27
NA,"Minister for Commerce, announced that",27
NA,he favoured the nayment of 2s. 10-id. a,27
NA,bushel fo r bagged wheat. That repre-,27
NA,sented approximately 2s. 6d. a bushel,27
NA,"at country sidings. On that occasion,",28
NA,Senator MCLeay said-,28
NA,I earnestly say that these financial pro-,28
NA,"posals represent not only a fair, but a",28
NA,"generous, nipiproach to the problem by the",28
NA,Government.,28
NA,"On the same subject, the honorable",28
NA,memiber for Barker ( Mr Archie,28
NA,Cameron) said-,28
NA,"In my opinion, the .price is too high. I",28
NA,confess frankly that I have not been enthusi-,28
NA,"astic ,'tliout any whe/it stabilization scheme.",28
NA,To-day those men are telling the people,28
NA,of Australia that the present Govern-,28
NA,ment lias let the primary producers down.,28
NA,By whom this broadcast statement Avas,28
NA,"authorized, I cannot remember-",28
NA,We cannot continue to provide largo sums,28
NA,of public money to support the wheat-growers,28
NA,while they go on producing unsaleable grain.,28
NA,Such a procedure would be demoralizing and,28
NA,unsound.,28
NA,"The Leader of the Opposition, speaking",28
NA,"at a meeting on one occasion, said words",28
NA,to the effect that farmers never paid a,28
NA,decent wage. That is not the farmer's,28
NA,fault. He is the creature of circum-,28
NA,stance. Always at the mercy of financial,28
NA,"interests, he has never controlled his own",28
NA,business. He had no control over the,28
NA,"price of the goods he produced, and this",28
NA,city concentration has been a disadvan-,28
NA,tage to him and to the nation. I f we,28
NA,are to develop this country and increase,28
NA,"its population, we must have greater re-",28
NA,gard for human values than we have had.,28
NA,"We must be prepared, with other nations,",28
NA,to practise the principles of the Atlantic,28
NA,"Charter: Freedom from fear, freedom",28
NA,"from want, freedom of speech and free-",28
NA,dom of worship. Those ideals offer some,28
NA,"hope to the human race, and i f they are",28
NA,realized they will give this nation an,28
NA,"incentive to expand, confident that its",28
NA,future is assured.,28
NA,.If the primary producers of this,28
NA,munity are to succeed-we should make,28
NA,that possible for them as there is,28
NA,shadow of doubt that they are of the,28
NA,first importance to the country-the,28
NA,mortgage branch of the Commonwealth,28
NA,Bank must give advances at a much,28
NA,lower rate of interest than at present;,28
NA,"alternatively, we must create a producers'",28
NA,hank. Of all the evils afflicting the,28
NA,"primary producer, the mortgage is the",28
NA,Mr Smith.,28
NA,"greatest, because its demands must be",28
NA,satisfied before he can satisfy the barest,28
NA,needs of himself and his dependants and,28
NA,because it forces him to work his soil,28
NA,"without rest. While the farmer must,",28
NA,in order to meet heavy annual interest,28
NA,"commitments, continue to deny his soil",28
NA,"the rest that Nature ordains, we shall",28
NA,never be able effectively to grapple with,28
NA,the twin problems of maintaining soil,28
NA,fertility and preventing soil erosion.,28
NA,"I u this chamber last September, I",28
NA,showed that soil erosion is one of the,28
NA,most urgent problems which this,28
NA,"country has to face, and I hope that the",28
NA,Commonwealth Soil Conservation Ser-,28
NA,"vice, the proposed establishment of",28
NA,which has been announced by the Minis-,28
NA,ter for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr.,28
NA,"Scully), will be set up without delay in",28
NA,order that it may speedily take up its,28
NA,"task, which, I consider, should also em-",28
NA,brace water conservation and re-afforesta-,28
NA,tion. More than ever before is the heed,28
NA,evident for an authority to undertake,28
NA,those three tasks in the interests not,28
NA,only of ourselves but also of posterity.,28
NA,We live from our soils. Depleted soil,28
NA,vigour means depleted human vigour and,28
NA,unfertile soil an unfertile people.,28
NA,Destroy the soil and you destroy the,28
NA,"nation. A nation with 60 per cent, of its",28
NA,population living in cities under arti-,28
NA,"ficial conditions of life, will not repro-",28
NA,duce in sufficient numbers to maintain,28
NA,a natural life. Keep only sufficient on,28
NA,the land to feed the population in the,28
NA,cities and then denature the foodstuffs,28
NA,"by refining and preservation, and the",28
NA,result must be national extinction.,28
NA,Rural areas are the only sure source of,28
NA,population increase. A natural affinity,28
NA,exists between man and the soil; remove,28
NA,him from contact with freshly grown,28
NA,foods and he becomes as stale as the,28
NA,food he consumes. Our need is to dis-,28
NA,comtribute our population over the more,28
NA,fertile areas of our land on smaller,28
NA,not a holdings. To that eud the financial,28
NA,octopus that is strangling the life out,28
NA,of our nation must be grappled with.,28
NA,Because primary production is the life-,28
NA,"stream of this nation, the Commonwealth",28
NA,"Bank, through its mortgage department",28
NA,"or a producers' bank, should purchase -",28
NA,all banks and privately held mortgages on,28
NA,"land used for primary production, and",29
NA,interest should be reduced to a flat rate,29
NA,of 11 per cent.,29
NA,I make it quite clear to those who,29
NA,have written to me protesting against,29
NA,the Government's banking proposals,29
NA,that they have a perfect right to exby,29
NA,press their opinions on that or any assuming,29
NA,"other subject, but that they must give",29
NA,me the same right. Most of the protests,29
NA,"1. have received were prepared for those matter,",29
NA,who signed them by the banks or other,29
NA,financial interests. I have no hesitation,29
NA,"in saying that because, for the most part,",29
NA,the phrasing of the letters is identical. and,29
NA,Those from the same district are written,29
NA,on the same class of paper and contained,29
NA,in similar envelopes. I n contrast to years,29
NA,"the stereotyped protests sent to me, I which",29
NA,received from a farmer constituent of,29
NA,"mine, who is not obliged to go cap in",29
NA,"hand to the bank for an overdraft, a destruction.",29
NA,letter from which the following is an,29
NA,extract:-,29
NA,I am anxiously waiting for the bank legis-,29
NA,lation. I hope i t will go through. I know,29
NA,for a fact that many who had petitions placed,29
NA,"under their noses to sign, signed because",29
NA,"under the banks' thumb,, they dare not refuse,",29
NA,otherwise they be asked to reduce their over-,29
NA,"draft, so if I were in your place I would take",29
NA,the petitions for what they are worth.,29
NA,[Extension of lime granted.'],29
NA,When I sought the suffrages of my con-,29
NA,stituents at the last general election I,29
NA,gave them a pledge that i f I and the,29
NA,Labour party I supported were returned,29
NA,to office I should make it one of my first,29
NA,duties to advocate banking reform. I am,29
NA,well pleased that I now have the,29
NA,opportunity to address myself to this sub-,29
NA,ject so soon after the Treasurer ( Mr.,29
NA,Chifley) has introduced the measures,29
NA,embodying the Government's proposals,29
NA,for banking reform. I have not yet failed,29
NA,"to honour any pledge which I have given,",29
NA,"and, regardless of the consequences to",29
NA,"myself personally, I have no intention of",29
NA,retracting the promise which I gave to,29
NA,my constituents in respect of this subject.,29
NA,"Fortunately, I am not wholly dependent",29
NA,upon my parliamentary salary for a,29
NA,"livelihood. However, the Government's",29
NA,proposals are in the best interests of the,29
NA,country. On this matter I agree entirely,29
NA,with the views expressed in the follow-,29
NA,"ing letter, dated the 20th January last,",29
NA,which I received from one of my con-,29
NA,stituents who is a returned soldier of the,29
NA,"last war, and whose name I shall be",29
NA,pleased to supply to any who might doubt,29
NA,the authenticity of the communication:-,29
NA,I am enclosing printed matter I received,29
NA,post which I consider an insult to my,29
NA,intelligence and yours. I t insults me in,29
NA,that I am unable to express my own,29
NA,"views on the question, and insults you in",29
NA,assuming that you would believe this printed,29
NA,"i f signed by me, to represent my own",29
NA,considered opinion.,29
NA,I am a returned soldier of 1914-18 War and,29
NA,have two sons in the services to-day (my only,29
NA,other son is sixteen years of age). I sincerely,29
NA,"hope that the men who are lighting to-dny,",29
NA,"those already discharged, will not have to",29
NA,face the difficulties which confronted many of,29
NA,us on our return to civil life and during the,29
NA,which followed. I t is a tragic policy,29
NA,assures us that we cannot expect to be,29
NA,as prosperous when all are producing for use,29
NA,as when the majority of our men are engaged,29
NA,in destruction or producing the means of,29
NA,' I trust that never again will financial in-,29
NA,terests be able to bring about economic depres-,29
NA,"sion, while abundance of all the necessities of",29
NA,"life exist alongside extreme poverty, simply",29
NA,through withholding the medium which enables,29
NA,a man to exchange his labour or produce for,29
NA,being goods or services on an equitable basis.,29
NA,Those are the views of people who have,29
NA,come through the mill. I am not a,29
NA,"financier, and I do not claim to under-",29
NA,stand finance in the full sense of the,29
NA,word; but I know something about the,29
NA,"operations of the present banking system,",29
NA,and as the result of that experience I am,29
NA,anxious that the Government's proposals,29
NA,shall be enacted assoon as possible.,29
NA,When the Leader of the Opposi-,29
NA,tion ( Mr Menzies) was addressing a,29
NA,meeting as part of the preliminaries,29
NA,in the formation of the new Liberal,29
NA,"party he said in effect, according",29
NA,"to press reports of his remarks, that the",29
NA,Labour caucus was composed of ignorant,29
NA,and irresponsible men. I am surprised,29
NA,that a cultured man like the right honor-,29
NA,able gentleman should cast such asper-,29
NA,sions on honorable members on this side,29
NA,of the House. As a member of the Go-,29
NA,vernment party I take strong exception,29
NA,to those remarks. They remind me of,29
NA,the speech made by the right honorable,29
NA,member for Cowper ( Sir EarlePage),29
NA,when he was Prime Minister- I think he,29
NA,held the office for one day-i n which he,29
NA,attacked the present Leader of the Oppo-,29
NA,"sition, and the reply made by the Leader",29
NA,of the Opposition on that occasion i n,30
NA,which he likened the attack made upon,30
NA,him to a stream of mud. Judging from,30
NA,his recent attack upon members of the,30
NA,Government party to which I have just,30
NA,"referred, i t would appear that the Leader",30
NA,of the Opposition did not escape un-,30
NA,"contaminated, because to-day he is indulg-",30
NA,ing i n tactics similar to those of which,30
NA,he accused the right honorable member,30
NA,for Cowper. I n his unfair and unjust,30
NA,reference to honorable members on this,30
NA,side of the chamber he is himseif casting,30
NA,"mud. However, abuse is not argument;",30
NA,"and, again, I express surprise that a man",30
NA,of the attainments of the right honorable,30

NA,I am sure that they w i l l react against,30
NA,him and the party he now leads.,30
NA,"repeat, that I am pledged to support the",30
NA,Government's banking proposals.,30
NA,letters which I wrote recently to my con-,30
NA,stituents I pointed out that the pro-,30
NA,paganda being disseminated throughout,30
NA,the country to-day i n the interests of the,30
NA,banks and other financial institutions is,30
NA,similar to that circulated throughout,30
NA,Australia when the Fisher Government,30
NA,brought down its proposals f or the estab-,30
NA,lishment of the Commonwealth Bank.,30
NA,"One of my constituents, an ex-banker,",30
NA,replied that I was wrong i n the views I,30
NA,"expressed, but I have taken the oppor-",30
NA,tunity to refresh my memory of the,30
NA,happenings at that time. I consulted,30
NA,the files of the Adelaide Register f or,30
NA,1911 which at that time was one of the,30
NA,leading newspapers i n the Common-,30
NA,wealth. I n the issue of that paper dated,30
NA,"the 17th November of that year, when",30
NA,the Commonwealth Bank B i l l was at the,30
NA,"second-reading stage, I found the follow-",30
NA,"ing leading article, which honorable",30
NA,members no doubt w i l l perceive bears a,30
NA,close resemblance to the leading articles,30
NA,now being published i n the Melbourne,30
NA,Herald and the Sydney Sun:- _,30
NA,"If a Com monwealth Bank is not required,",30
NA,it will be an expensive encumbrance fraught,30
NA,with possibilities of serious mischief to Aus-,30
NA,tralia. The proposal to create the bank un-,30
NA,justly conveys an implied reflection upon the,30
NA,"business capacities of Australians, because it",30
NA,i3 undeniable that the banking facilities in,30
NA,existence are excellent in character and ample,30
NA,"in scope. Obviously, if the savings of the",30
NA,"people are to be diverted to federal purposes,",30
NA,the State Government will be gravely handi-,30
NA,enpped. Their difficulties in floating loans will,30
NA,Mr Smith.,30
NA,"be increased, and consequently higher rates",30
NA,of interest will be demanded. The federal,30
NA,scheme may also lead to a material increase,30
NA,iu the interest rates for accommodation on,30
NA,"mortgages and other securities, and thus in-",30
NA,volve loss to the whole community.,30
NA,"I recall that, i n 1920, interest rates on",30
NA,second mortgages were between 8 per,30
NA,"cent, and 10 per cent, and on first mort-",30
NA,"gages, 7^ per cent. The extract con-",30
NA,tinued-,30
NA,"From the standpoint of international law, a",30
NA,Commonwealth Bank is open to objection-b y,30
NA,no means merely academic-o n account of,30
NA,being indirectly a menace to peace. Regula-,30
NA,tions under the Hague Convention expressly,30
NA,"enact that "" private property cannot be confis-",30
NA,"cated "". They safeguard the moneys of a",30
NA,"private bank and enable its credit to endure,",30
NA,even through a military disaster; but clearly,30

NA,If there is a genuine demand for the Com-,30
NA,"monwealth Bank-an d there has been no sig""i",30
NA,of it-,30
NA,The same objection is voiced to the,30
NA,banking proposals of the present Govern-,30

NA,. . . that demand proceeds from a section,30
NA,of the public who imagine that the institution,30
NA,"will deal "" generously"" with them. Appa-",30
NA,"rently, therefore, if the bank is to satisfy its",30
NA,"most ardent advocates, i t will precipitate a",30
NA,"financial disaster, in which the fair name of",30
NA,the whole Commonwealth may be besmirched.,30
NA,Those comments appeared i n the Register,30
NA,"in 1911. To-day, the Register is only a",30
NA,"memory, but the Commonwealth Bank",30
NA,is a monument to the Fisher Government,30
NA,and the Commonwealth of Australia. I,30
NA,wholeheartedly commend the Govern-,30
NA,ment's banking proposals.,30
NA,The views expressed by the Prime,30
NA,Minister on international affairs and,30
NA,agreements w i l l have widespread support.,30
NA,I f Australia is selfishly to devote itself,30
NA,solely to its own interests and disregard,30
NA,"the rights of other countries, the prospect",30
NA,of preserving peace i n the future w i l l be,30
NA,remote indeed. I conclude w i th an ex-,30

NA,"Digest of January, 1944, by Mr W i l l i a m",30
NA,"Hard, who was writing on the subject of",30
NA,American internationalism-,30
NA,"If this world means to have peace, i t must",30
NA,first have economic well-being. I do not say,30
NA,that prosperity insures peace. I do say that,30
NA,poverty and depression are the biggest danger,30
NA,to peace.,30
NA,Those words admirably express my,31
NA,own views. One nation cannot enjoy,31
NA,economic security while other nations,31
NA,have a very low standard of living. I f,31
NA,we put into practice the principles of the,31

NA,"including Australia, will be assured.",31
Mr LEMMON ,Forrest) [4.50] -O n rural industries.,31
NA,"behalf of the electors of Forrest, I desire",31
NA,to extend a welcome to His Royal HighGeneral's,31
NA,"ness the Governor-General, the Duchess,",31
NA,and their f amily. When I listened to,31
NA,"Governor-General's Speech, the member",31
NA,"sitting next to me remarked: "" This is an",31
NA,"historic occasion"". After His Royal",31
NA,"Highness had concluded his Speech, I",31
NA,"commented: ""This is an historic occatralia",31
NA,sion for two reasons. The first is that,31
NA,His Royal Highness is the first member,31
NA,of the Royal Family to become Governorcompelled,31
NA,General of the Commonwealth of Ausshortage,31
NA,tralia. The second is that the Speech,31
NA,demonstrates that this Government has,31
NA,"already, to a certain degree, given effect",31
NA,to the promises which it made to the,31
NA,members of the fighting forces and the,31
NA,"civilian population"". The Curtin Goto-day.",31
NA,vernment is the only administration in,31
NA,the world which has already tackled the,31
NA,problem of rehabilitation while the nation,31
NA,"is still at war. Therefore, I consider that",31
NA,the opening of the third session of,31
NA,17th Parliament will be historic.,31
NA,The seventeenth paragraph of the,31
NA,Governor-General's Speech stated that-,31
NA,Australia's role in allied strategy has,31
NA,for a major effort in the feeding of the,31
NA,iirmics of liberation.,31
NA,The next paragraph declared that,31
NA,Australia's annual expenditure on food,31
NA,"for the services now exceeds £100,000,000.",31
NA,Because of the gigantic task that,31
NA,"has been allotted to Australia, I",31
NA,take this opportunity to pay a tribute,31
NA,to the primary producers of this country.,31
NA,The proportion of enlistments from,31
NA,Section was higher than that from any,31
NA,other section of the community. When,31
NA,Australia was threatened with invasion,31
NA,"by the Japanese, many sons of farmers",31
NA,"enlisted i n the services, and their fathers, introduced.",31
NA,who had ceased active farming two or,31
NA,"three years before, again assumed the",31
NA,management of the properties. I n doing,31
NA,they have rendered . excellent service. other States ?,31
NA,Proof of that is to be found in the manner,31
NA,in which they have maintained produc-,31
NA,tion. I was gratified to learn that in June,31
NA,the Government will reconsider the,31
NA,present allocation of man-power; and I,31
NA,hope that a large percentage of men,31
NA,released from the services or from indus-,31
NA,try later this year will be diverted to,31
NA,Paragraph 19 of the Governor-,31
NA,Speech announced that Aus-,31
NA,"tralia had been compelled , to import grain,",31
NA,the and members of the Country party have,31
NA,confidently asserted that the Scully wheat,31
NA,scheme was responsible for that situation.,31
NA,"To disprove their statements, I take the",31
NA,only other period in the history of Aus-,31
NA,that compared with the present-,31
NA,"time, namely, 1914. That year was the",31
NA,last occasion on which Australia was,31
NA,to import grain. There was no,31
NA,of man-power or superphosphate,31
NA,and no restrictions had been imposed on,31
NA,production. The explanation was that,31
NA,drought had ruined the crops. For ex-,31
NA,"actly the same reason, the Commonwealth",31
NA,Government is obliged to import grain,31
Mr HOLT ,Wh y was the wheat,31
NA,acreage restricted in Western Australia?,31
NA,"Mr LEMMON"" -Whe n acreage re-",31
NA,striction in Western Australia was first,31
NA,"the proposed, a representative of Western",31
NA,Australian wheat-growers came to Can-,31
NA,berra. That representative was no other,31
NA,"than Mr Teasd'ale, of whom the honor-",31
NA,able member for Barker ( Mr Archie,31
NA,called Cameron) and the honorable member for,31
NA,Indi spoke as the most able wheat expert,31
NA,in Australia. Mr Teasdale implored the,31
NA,Government to introduce a complete,31
NA,wheat-growing holiday in Western Aus-,31
NA,tralia. His view was that not a bushel,31
NA,of wheat should be grown in that State.,31
NA,"However, the Western Australian wheat-",31
NA,growers regarded that recommendation,31
NA,as too drastic. The Minister for Com-,31
NA,this merce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully),31
NA,"listened to their plea, and restricted",31
NA,wheat-growing to one-third of the basic,31
NA,acreage. That is the reason why the one-,31
NA,third reduction in Western Australia was,31
Mr HOLT ,Doe s the honorable mem-,31
NA,ber not think that the differing rates have,31
NA,so the effect of reducing production in the,31
Mr LEMMON , N o t at all. As I,32
NA,"have said, this country is short of wheat",32
NA,to-day because of the reduced quantities,32
NA,of superphosphate available during the,32
NA,last three years and because of the,32
NA,drought. I n some of the best wheat-,32
NA,producing lands i n the Commonwealth-,32
NA,I am referring to certain wheat-growing,32
NA,areas in the eastern States-ther e has,32
NA,"been a drought f o r two years. Last year,",32
NA,the Minister for Commerce and Agricul-,32
NA,ture said that farmers who had suffered,32
NA,because of the drought should endeavour,32
NA,to sow twice their former acreage.,32
NA,I wish to refer now to the action of,32
NA,tlie honorable member f o r I n d i i n pro-,32
NA,claiming to the country that there had,32
NA,"been a "" £10,000,000 wheat steal"". The",32
NA,honorable member's propaganda methods,32
NA,in this regard are similar to those em-,32
NA,"ployed by Dr Goebbels i n Germany,",32
NA,"namely, the use of half-truths and mis-",32
NA,"statements which, i n effect, are the",32
NA,blackest of lies. I shall analyse briefly,32
NA,"what he calls the wheat ""steal"". When",32
NA,he first made his allegations on the 14th,32
NA,"September, 1944, he said-",32
NA,A comparison of tlie estimated return from,32
NA,wheat which will be sold in Australia prior,32
NA,"to 1945-46 harvest under the present policy,",32
NA,with the valuation of that wheat at present,32
NA,export value-fo r I - am willing to accept,32
NA,lis. Od. as a fair value-wil l show that in,32
NA,the next eighteen months the wheat-growers,32
NA,"will bo the victims of a wheat ""steal"" of",32
NA,"f 10.000,000.",32
NA,"Two months later, the honorable mem-",32
NA,"ber made another statement, i n which he",32
NA,"quoted remarks by Mr Teastlale, whom",32
NA,"lie admits to be a wheat expert, and",32
NA,whom I know to be well informed not,32
NA,"only on the wheat position i n Australia,",32
NA,but also i n regard to' the wheat markets,32
NA,"of the world. The honorable member,",32
NA,"referring to Mr Teasdale, said-",32
NA,If the amount to be paid by the Government,32
NA,to the Wheat Board to bridge the gap between,32
NA,the concessional price for stock-feed and the,32
NA,average export realization be taken as the,32
NA,"correct principle, then the Government will",32
NA,liiLve to pav to the board approximately,32
NA,"£8,850,000. If, on the other hand, the",32
NA,realization of wheat sold in the free market,32
NA,"east of Suez be taken as a basis, then the",32
NA,"Government, to do justice to the grower, will",32
NA,"need to pay in approximately £9,850,000 on",32
NA,sicroiint of the two pools 0 and 7.,32
NA,"I n effect the honora'ble member said,",32
NA,""" I f the Government had. taken the pre-",32
NA,sent realization for wheat that the board,32
NA,"sold two years ago . . . "" Using",32
NA,that argument I could say that five years,32
NA,"ago I sold 2,000 bags of wheat to Louis",32
NA,Dreyfus and Company Limited f o r 2s.,32
NA,"a bushel, and i n the next year the price",32
NA,"of wheat .rose to 5s. a bushel, therefore",32
NA,Louis Dreyfus and Company Limited,32
NA,stole that extra 3s. a bushel from me.,32
NA,"That, of course, is ridiculous, yet i t is",32
NA,the basis of the argument advanced by,32
NA,the honorable memiber i n support of the,32
NA,"alleged ""wheat steal"". B u t let me",32
NA,examine this contention a little further.,32
NA,Bearing i n mind that the honorable,32
NA,member had said on the 14th September,32
NA,"that the wheat "" steal"" would take place",32
NA,"in the ensuing eighteen months, i t is",32
NA,interesting to note that two months later,32
NA,-he said-,32
NA,"My estimate of £10,000,000 includes the",32
NA,succeeding No. 8 pool.,32
NA,"There he alleges that the wheat "" steal""",32
NA,goes back two years to the Nos. 6 and 7,32
NA,"pools, and includes also the No. 8 pool.",32
NA,"Then he changes his ground again, and",32
NA,says-,32
NA,Thus it is shown quite clearly by one of,32
NA,the best informed and most experienced wheat,32
NA,experts in the country that on the item of,32
NA,stock feed sales alone the wheat-growers have,32
NA,"been mulct of at least £10,000,000.",32
NA,First he quoted Mr Teasdale's figure of,32
NA,"£6,S00,000, and then almost i n the same",32
NA,breath he said that i n his opinion the,32
NA,"amount would 'he £10,000,000. The posi-",32
NA,"tion is as the Government has stated,",32
NA,"namely, that i n regard to stock feed a",32
NA,subsidy w i l l be paid to bring the return,32
NA,up to the realization price of the pool.,32
NA,"That, of course, removes the whole basis",32
NA,of the honorable member's argument.,32
NA,"However, he is still not satisfied. A l -",32
NA,though he finds that his argument is,32
NA,"entirely wrong, he persists i n talking",32
NA,"about the alleged "" steal "", and he adopts",32
NA,another basis of argument. This time,32
NA,"he has enlisted the support of Mr Coles,",32
NA,the president of the Farmers and Settlers,32
NA,"Association of New South Wales. Now,",32
NA,"current apparently, the "" steal"" is based on",32
NA,this argument which he addresses to,32
NA,"the growers: "" The Australian Govern-",32
NA,ment is only offering you 4s. 3d. a,32
NA,"bushel, siding basis, for your wheat,",32
NA,whilst the Government of the United,32
NA,States of America is offering 9s. 6d. a,32
NA,"bushel, the Canadian Government 5s. 9d.",32
NA,"a 'bushel, and the Government of Argen-",33
NA,"tina 4s. 6d. a bushel"". But let us",33
NA,"examine those figures. I n the first place,",33
NA,the American Government is not guaran-,33
NA,"teeing wheat-growers 9s. 6d. a bushel, but",33
NA,Ss. 5-Jd. a bushel on the basis of Aus-,33
NA,tralian currency. Although it is true,33
NA,that at a later date-probabl y some time,33
NA,"this year-th e price will go up to 9s. 6d.,",33
NA,the American figures cannot be taken,33
NA,"as parallel values. For instance, a",33
NA,haircut in the United States of America,33
NA,"costs a dollar i n Australian currency,",33
NA,and it would be just as logical for,33
NA,"Australian barbers to say: ""We are",33
NA,entitled to charge 6s. 6d. for a hair-,33
NA,"cut, because that is the price ruling in",33
NA,"America"". Actually there cannot 'he",33
NA,any such comparison of basic values. I f,33
NA,the United States of America is prepared,33
NA,to chase inflation I have no intention of,33
NA,assisting this country to do so. I n regard,33
NA,to Canada the system of wheat deliveries,33
NA,is entirely different from that applying,33
NA,in Australia. The Canadian farmer has,33
NA,"to store his own wheat. I n Australia,",33
NA,"the farmer strips his wheat, delivers i",33
NA,"tho sidings and is paid for it. I n Canada,",33
NA,a farmer who strips a crop averaging,33
NA,IS bushels to the acre may be told to,33
NA,deliver one-sixth of the yield immedi-,33
NA,ately. A month later he may be told to,33
NA,deliver a similar quantity. This instal-,33
NA,ment delivery may go on for nine or ten,33
NA,"months, and during this time the quality",33
NA,of the wheat deteriorates. I f it is not,33
NA,fair average quality when i t is brought,33
NA,"to scales, the dock is taken by the farmer.",33
NA,He has to pay the cost of storage and he,33
NA,loses the interest on the delayed realiza-,33
NA,tion for the period during which the,33
NA,wheat has been stored. Often he has to,33
NA,cart his wheat through snow. This system,33
NA,costs money to the farmer and requires,33
NA,extra man-power. The honorable member,33
NA,for Indi took no consideration of these,33
NA,facts when he made his comparisons. The,33
NA,last country he mentioned was Argentina.,33
NA,That country should .provide a reasonable,33
NA,"comparison with Australia, having regard",33
NA,to the proportion of its wheat that is,33
NA,exported and the relationship of wheat,33
NA,to the national economy. The honorable,33
NA,member said that the price in Argen-,33
NA,tina is 4s. 6d. a bushel on a siding,33
NA,basis. That is incorrect. Argentina has,33
NA,established a price of 4s. 6d. a bushel,33
NA,delivered at ports. I f we make a fair,33
NA,"comparison, we find that Australia guar-",33
NA,antees a price of 5s. 3d. a bushel at,33
NA,ports.,33
NA,These are the supposed parallels which,33
NA,the honorable memiber for Indi has used,33
NA,in an endeavour to incite the farmers,33
NA,to march on Canberra. What is the,33
NA,motive behind all this propaganda? I t,33
NA,is nothing more than an endeavour by,33
NA,the stooges of the merchants to smash,33
NA,organized marketing in this country. I .,33
NA,appeal to my fellow farmers not to heed,33
NA,such utterances. They should stick to,33
NA,the policy which has been enunciated by,33
NA,their organizations ever since they were,33
NA,first formed. They should recall the,33
NA,"story of tlie dog and the bone, and not",33
NA,drop the substance for the shadow. The,33
NA,International Wheat Agreement will,33
NA,"ensure stability of prices, which will in",33
NA,turn provide security for the farmers,33
NA,and their families. By maintaining a,33
NA,"system of organized marketing, the",33
NA,growers will retain a solid foundation,33
NA,t to for their industry. I f they accept the,33
NA,policy of the so-called representatives of,33
NA,"the farmers, who are actually doing the",33
NA,"work of the private merchants, they will",33
NA,be forced to accept a fleeting price for,33
NA,their product and they will be at the,33
NA,mercy of the international wheat specu-,33
NA,lator.,33
NA,His Royal Highness the Governor-,33
NA,General also referred to the task of,33
NA,rehabilitating anemibers of the fighting,33
NA,forces. I was very pleased to hear this,33
NA,afternoon from the Minister for Supply,33
NA,and Shipping that Australia is already,33
NA,exporting double-weft cloth to New Zea-,33
NA,land. The Government will be respon-,33
NA,sible for finding markets for many things,33
NA,which we are able to manufacture in,33
NA,Australia. I was also gratified to hear,33
NA,that the Minister for Commerce and,33
NA,Agriculture ( Mr Scully) proposed to,33
NA,"introduce a bill dealing with wool, and",33
NA,that arrangements have been made by,33
NA,the British Ministry of Food to take,33
NA,"34,000 cases of apples from Western",33
NA,"Australia for England this year, and",33
NA,that it will endeavour to increase that,33
NA,"number to 72,000 cases. These facts",33
NA,indicate that the Government is already,33
NA,preparing plans for post-war recon-,33
NA,struction. I was also impressed,33
NA,favorably when. I heard the right honor-,34
NA,able member for Cowper (' Sir Earle,34
NA,Page) and the honorable memiber for,34
NA,Kalgoorlie ( Mr Johnson) ably expound,34
NA,the importance of water conservation and,34
NA,reticulation in Australia. Projects such,34
NA,as these and the standardization of rail-,34
NA,way gauges ar<j national works which are,34
NA,the direct responsibility of this Parlia-,34
NA,"ment. I hope that, in order to handle",34
NA,"these tasks, the Government will preserve",34
NA,the nucleus of the Civil Constructional,34
NA,Corps on the basis of voluntary enlist-,34
NA,ment in the years of peace. We can,34
NA,vise its experience and the modern,34
NA,machinery which it possesses in carrying,34
NA,many of our post-war plans into effect.,34
NA,I hope also that the Government will,34
NA,give a high priority to the linking of,34
NA,the Indian Ocean with the Pacific Ocean,34
NA,by a standard gauge railway passing,34
NA,through the national capital. I disagree,34
NA,with the attitude of the honorable mem-,34
NA,ber for Denison (Dr Gaha) towards,34
NA,"Canberra, because I consider that the",34
NA,Government should endeavour to do away,34
NA,with State parochialism and endea-,34
NA,vour to develop a national outlook.,34
NA,One way in which it can help to do,34
NA,this is by establishing a standard gauge,34
NA,railway linking Canberra with all States.,34
NA,The settlement of ex-servicemen on the,34
NA,Land was also referred to by His Royal,34
NA,Highness the Governor-iGeneral.,34
NA,undertaking has greater pitfalls than,34
NA,this. We must learn from the tragedies,34
NA,of the past in dealing with this problem.,34
NA,The complete loss to all governments in,34
NA,Australia involved by the land settlement,34
NA,schemes which followed rthe war of,34
NA,"1914-18 was £45,000,000, representing an",34
NA,"average loss of £1,200 in respect of every",34
NA,soldier settler. I do not quibble at the,34
NA,"penditure of the money, but that loss must",34
NA,be an indication of the broken hopes of,34
NA,the men who returned from the war and,34
NA,tried to start life afresh on the land.,34
NA,I do not want to see a repetition of that,34
NA,tragic story as the result of allowing,34
NA,our boys to settle on over-capitalized,34
NA,holdings and eventually to find them-,34
NA,selves in a condition of debt and despair.,34
NA,The Wheat and Wool Growers Union of,34
NA,Western Australia recently appointed a,34
NA,"vigilance committee, which already is",34
NA,doing good work to prevent a re-,34
NA,currence of past mistakes. A soldier,34
NA,Mr Lemmon.,34
NA,who returned not long ago had,34
NA,between £600 and £700 with which,34
NA,he wanted to buy a block of land.,34
NA,"He knew nothing about land, and he did",34
NA,not want assistance from the Government.,34
NA,He proposed to purchase an abandoned,34
NA,"farm 16 miles from the rail-head, and the",34
NA,country was such that he could not pos-,34
NA,sibly make a success of the enterprise.,34
NA,The committee induced him not to go on,34
NA,"with it, knowing that if he did so he",34
NA,"must lose his money, and break his heart",34
NA,too. When they approached a certain,34
NA,State officer who had recommended the,34
NA,"property, he told us that it was no",34
NA,concern of ours; if the soldier had,34
NA,the money he could go ahead and,34
NA,buy the land. I hope that this Govern-,34
NA,ment will take action to prevent men from,34
NA,making mistakes of the kind that this,34
NA,soldier so nearly made. Men should ibe,34
NA,prevented from entering into commit-,34
NA,"ments which can end only in bankruptcy,",34
NA,and in worry to themselves and their,34
NA,families.,34
NA,Steps should be taken to arrange for,34
NA,the use of modern machinery to assist,34
NA,in farming operations. An organization,34
NA,should be set up to control modern plant,34
NA,that would be used to put farms into a,34
NA,state of production before soldier settlers,34
NA,took possession. Here is an example of,34
NA,what can be achieved by such means:,34
NA,"No With the use of government rollers,",34
NA,timber was rolled on a certain area for,34
NA,"10s. an acre, and the clearing up was",34
NA,"done for another 5s. an acre, making a",34
NA,total of 15s. To have cut that timber,34
NA,"with the axe would have cost 35s. an acre,",34
NA,and burning and clearing up would prob-,34
NA,ably have cost another 15s. Similar,34
NA,economies can be achieved in the making,34
NA,exof dams for the - conservation of water.,34
NA,"When I started farming, we used to make",34
NA,"dams with .a scoop and a. team of horses,",34
NA,"and it cost £75 to rake out 1,000 yards.",34
NA,In later years tractors were used instead,34
NA,"of teams, and thereby the cost was re-",34
NA,"duced to £45. To-day, by the use of a",34
NA,"bulldozer, a similar dam can be excavated",34
NA,"for £10. I f suitable machinery be, used",34
NA,under supervision there need not be any,34
NA,financial loss on soldier settlement.,34
NA,I hope that once the men are placed,34
NA,"upon the farms, local committees of ex-",34
NA,perienced men will be set up to assist and,34
NA,"advise them. I n the past, the policy was",34
NA,to appoint as advisers to soldier settlers,35
NA,men who had academic qualifications-,35
NA,perhaps they were bachelors of agricul-,35
NA,ture-bu t they lacked practical experi-,35
NA,ence. Such men were deputed to advise,35
NA,the settler how to grow wheat or to run,35
NA,a dairy farm. The fact is that when a,35
NA,man leaves the university he knows noth-,35
NA,ing about farming-h e has only got ready,35
NA,to begin learning. The man who knows,35
NA,something about farming is he who,35
NA,"has been on the land for ten, fifteen, or",35
NA,twenty years. When I left the agri-,35
NA,"cultural college, I thought I understood",35
NA,"farming. Now, after I have been farm-",35
NA,"ing for seventeen years, I realize that I",35
NA,am only beginning to learn something,35
NA,aboii t it. These committees of experi-,35
NA,enced men should tell the new settler,35
NA,what land ought to be cleared for,35
NA,"cultivation, and what land should be left",35
NA,"under timber, and they should advise the",35
NA,settler generally on his farming opera-,35
NA,tions. I n this way many of the problems,35
NA,which bepet soldier settlers after the last,35
NA,war would never arise.,35
NA,We have heard during this debate many,35
NA,references to the declining birthrate in,35
NA,"Australia, and the need for a greater",35
NA,population. Some speakers have asserted,35
NA,that Australia could support a population,35
NA,"of as many as 100,000,000. I believe that",35
NA,if there is a continuation of dust storms,35
NA,-whic h arise from wind erosion-an d of,35
NA,"water erosion, which is the washing away",35
NA,"of the soil in our fertile valleys, and",35
NA,silting up of our rivers we shall be for-,35
NA,"tunate if, 50 years hence, Australia can",35
NA,"support a population of 10,000,000",35
NA,people. I t is possible that soil,35
NA,"erosion, unless something be done to",35
NA,"check it, will eventually convert much",35
NA,of the fertile wheat lands of South Aus-,35
NA,"tralia, Victoria and New South Wales",35
NA,into a sandy waste. Soil erosion is much,35
NA,more dangerous to the future of Australia,35
NA,than are the bombs falling on Berlin to,35
NA,the future of Germany. The destruction,35
NA,of a city represents no more than the,35
NA,waste of labour and of concrete and steel.,35
NA,"The damage can be quickly repaired, but",35
NA,when we lose the top layer of soil from,35
NA,"our countryside, we lose the work of",35
NA,nature over centuries. This top layer of,35
NA,"fertile soil, which is being blown away",35
NA,"in dust storms, consists of decomposed",35
NA,"or oxidized rock, plus humus, which is",35
NA,decayed animal and vegetable matter that,35
NA,has been acted on by bacteria. These,35
NA,"minute organisms, which can be detected",35
NA,"only by the microscope, are present in",35
NA,"humus in enormous numbers, and it is",35
NA,they which maintain the balance and pro-,35
NA,ductivity of the soil. They create organic,35
NA,"matter which distinguishes the top soil,",35
NA,"which is productive, from the sub-soil,",35
NA,which is non-productive. I f Australia,35
NA,"goes on losing this top layer of soil,",35
NA,which is being blown out over the Pacific,35
NA,"Ocean, and sometimes even gets as far",35
NA,"as New Zealand, where it becomes a valu-",35
NA,"able top-dressing for pastures, there will",35
NA,be a gradual decline of productivity.,35
NA,"Crops will yield less, pastures will become",35
NA,"poor so that they will carry fewer stock,",35
NA,and the stock themselves will be of poorer,35
NA,quality. They will become less resistant,35
NA,"to disease, and will have less food value.",35
NA,Erosion is tending all the time to destroy,35
NA,the balance which nature maintains in the,35
NA,soil. I t removes chemical properties,35
NA,"which are necessary in plant life, i f those",35
NA,plants are to nourish healthy animals.,35
NA,I t is hardly necessary for me to remind,35
NA,honorable members that age-old Egyptian,35
NA,cities are to-day choked with sand as the,35
NA,"result of soil erosion, because the people",35
NA,"of ancient times, in their ignorauce,",35
NA,"robbed the soil instead of farming it, thus",35
NA,upsetting the balance of Nature. The,35
NA,Roman Empire made a desert of North,35
NA,Africa in the very same way. I n recent,35
NA,"the years, we have the spectacle of the dust",35
NA,"bowl of the United States of America,",35
NA,"caused by the exploitation of the soil, not",35
NA,"through ignorance, but under economic",35
NA,pressure. Are we in Australia to remain,35
NA,blind to these lessons? I think not.,35
NA,We know the reasons for soil erosion.,35
NA,"I t is caused, in the main, by economic",35
NA,conditions which lead to the exploitation,35
NA,of the soil through over-cropping and,35
NA,over-stocking. A good deal is due to the,35
NA,instability of markets which force,35
NA,"farmers to depart, from sound prin-",35
NA,"ciples of farming, aud to follow unsound",35
NA,methods in order to get a higher return,35
NA,in the immediate future so as to meet,35
NA,their financial commitments. The remedy,35
NA,"does not lie in giving lectures, or in",35
NA,"exhibiting films, or in distributing",35
NA,"pamphlets, or in radio broadcasts. I t lies",35
NA,in practical demonstrations by officers of,35
NA,"the Agricultural Departments, and in the",35
NA,improvement of economic conditions in,36
NA,marginal farming areas so that -men may,36
NA,be able to make farming pay while still,36
NA,following good farming practices. I hope,36
NA,that the Government will set up an autho-,36
NA,rity under the Council for Scientific and,36
NA,Industrial Eesearch for the purpose of,36
NA,collating the researches carried out by,36
NA,the various State Departments of Agri-,36
NA,culture.,36
NA,[Extension of time granted.],36
NA,"To sum up, I suggest that the com-",36
NA,"pulsory wheat pool should be continued,",36
NA,"with a guaranteed minimum price, in",36
NA,order to provide stability in the post-war,36
NA,period for primary producers. The Go-,36
NA,vernment should establish a 'Common-,36
NA,wealth Wheat Eesearch Institute under,36
NA,the direction of the Council for Scientific,36
NA,"and Industrial Eesearch, for the purpose",36
NA,of improving the milling qualities of,36
NA,Australian wheat. I t should maintain .a,36
NA,nucleus of the Civil Constructional,36
NA,Corps as an organization on a voluntary,36
NA,basis to tackle tho post-war .job of land,36
NA,"settlement, standardization of railway",36
NA,"gauges, and water conservation and .re-",36
NA,ticulation. We should use local knowledge,36
NA,"for advising soldier settlers, on methods",36
NA,"of cultivation, and to advise themwhich",36
NA,"areas should be left under timber because,",36
NA,"if they were cleared, they would erode.",36
NA,AVe should set up a Commonwealth com-,36
NA,mission under the Department of Post-,36
NA,war Eeconstruction to tackle soil erosion,36
NA,on a national basis. These practical sug-,36
NA,"gestions will, I hope, be of assistance to",36
NA,the Government when i t is preparing,36
NA,legislation to give effect to the policy,36
NA,outlined in the Speech of the Governor-,36
NA,General.,36
Mr RIORDAN ,Kennedy) [5.27] - I,36
NA,"support the motion, and I join with other",36
NA,honorable members in welcoming to Aus-,36
NA,"tralia their Eoyjal Highnesses, the Duke",36
NA,"and Duchess of Gloucester, and the mem-",36
NA,bers of their family. I trust that their,36
NA,"stay here will be enjoyable, and that when",36
NA,they leave they will carry away with,36
NA,them many happy memories.,36
NA,"The Governor-General, in his Speech;",36
NA,mentioned the drought which has caused,36
NA,such serious loss in many parts of the,36
NA,Commonwealth. The problem of drought,36
NA,is not a new otic in Australia. I t may,36
NA,be said to be a part of our heritage.,36
NA,Every year some part of Australia is,36
NA,affected by drought. When the country,36
NA,"is gripped by a severe drought, much is",36
NA,"said and written about the need, to take",36
NA,precautions to meet such a situation; but,36
NA,"when the rains come, all proposals for",36
NA,grappling with the problem are put on,36
NA,one side and forgotten till drought recurs.,36
NA,"Only last year, this Parliament voted",36
NA,money for the relief of drought-stricken,36
NA,"areas, but the people in many parts of",36
NA,Australia which are subject to drought,36
NA,received no assistance from the Common-,36
NA,wealth or from the State governments.,36
NA,I n time of drought hundreds of families,36
NA,are ruined by conditions over which they,36
NA,"have no control, but those conditions",36
NA,might be controlled or mitigated by go-,36
NA,vernment action. This Parliament should,36
NA,deal with the matter as a national,36
NA,"problem, or it could act in association",36
NA,with the State governments. I t is my,36
NA,earnest wish that the National Parlia-,36
NA,ment should deal with the problems of,36
NA,drought and soil erosion in a national,36
NA,way. The present Government has,36
NA,already improved the lot of a considerable,36
NA,"section of the people, but I now appeal",36
NA,to it to give serious consideration to the,36
NA,need for investigation of all proposals,36
NA,advanced for the purpose of mitigating,36
NA,the effects of drought. During the last,36
NA,"parliamentary sittings great duststorms,",36
NA,the like of: which had never previously,36
NA,"been experienced, occurred in certain",36
NA,parts of Australia. I t Was stated by the,36
NA,honorable member for Forrest ( Mr.,36
NA,Lemmon) that those storms carried away,36
NA,the top soil of fertile farms in Victoria,36
NA,"and New South Wales, much of whicli",36
NA,was blown into the ocean. The question,36
NA,has been asked whether there is a dust,36
NA,bowl in Australia. I am convinced that -,36
NA,"there is, and that it is centred in the",36
NA,Lake Eyre district in Central Australia.,36
NA,Sand from that area has been blown into,36
NA,"Queensland and New South Wales, and",36
NA,even Victoria has been affected. I n,36
NA,"South Australia, many farmers have been",36
NA,forced to lea've their homes because of. the,36
NA,sand deposited by means o£ windstorms.,36
NA,The brown soil plains in the gibber,36
NA,country are interspersed at intervals of,36
NA,"many chains, and, in some places,",36
NA,"miles, with sand dunes from which the",36
NA,sand is moving in the direction of New,36
NA,"South Wales and South Australia, and",36
NA,even the pastoral areas of Queensland,37
NA,and Victoria are threatened. Those men,37
NA,who are courageous enough to work on,37
NA,the frontiers of Australia for the purpose,37
NA,of carrying on primary production are,37
NA,concerned about the approach of this,37
NA,sand from the Lake Eyre district.,37
NA,The late Dr Bradfield left valuable,37
NA,proposals for the improvement of the,37
NA,position. He achieved an international,37
NA,"reputation, and has left many monuments",37
NA,"in Australia, one of which is his. scheme",37
NA,for the preservation of our heritage by,37
NA,mitigating the effects of drought and thus,37
NA,saving the people of this country many,37
NA,millions of pounds. I f no action be,37
NA,taken to grapple with the problem of soil,37
NA,"erosion, the present devastation will",37
NA,tinue until the more fertile portions,37
NA,of the continent are affected. The time,37
NA,is longoverdue for a complete investi-,37
NA,gation of Dr Bradfield's proposals. They,37
NA,were not hurriedly prepared. He himself,37
NA,declared that for 30 years he had given,37
NA,"thought to the problem, having ridden",37
NA,through most of the northern portion of,37
NA,"Queensland on horseback, and walked",37
NA,over a great area of the country. He came,37
NA,to the conclusion that water which now,37
NA,runs to waste into the Pacific Ocean,37
NA,on the eastern side of the Great,37
NA,Dividing Range in far northern,37
NA,"Queensland, should be diverted to the",37
NA,western portion of that State. That,37
NA,would make a greatly increased popula-,37
NA,"tion possible in that part of Queensland,",37
NA,and lead to the preservation of the pas-,37
NA,toral industry. The Battle for the I n -,37
NA,"land, written by P. R. V. Timbury,",37
NA,should be read by every honorable mem-,37
NA,ber. The scheme outlined by Dr Brad-,37
NA,field appears as an appendix to that,37
NA,Timbury refers not only to the Bradfield,37
NA,"scheme, but also to the proposals in Ion",37
NA,"Idriess' book, The Great Boomerang,",37
NA,and urges that the Government should,37
NA,take action to implement those schemes.,37
NA,"I hope that the Government will, as",37
NA,"soon as possible, appoint a committee,",37
NA,"if not a royal commission, of expert and",37
NA,practical men for the purpose of investi-,37
NA,gating the proposals of Bradfield and,37
NA,Idriess. Timbury's book is a. valuable,37
NA,contribution to the literature dealing,37
NA,with the development of this continent.,37
NA,Dr Bradfield first proposed that the,37
NA,"ftoodwaters f the Tully, Herbert, Burde-",37
NA,0,37
NA,"kin and Clarke rivers, at about the 1,400-",37
NA,fit. level on the coastal side of the Great,37
NA,"Dividing Range in north Queensland,",37
NA,should be diverted. To-day those waters,37
NA,rush away to the Pacific Ocean and no use,37
NA,is made of them. At present those rivers,37
NA,are in flood. The flood in the Clarke,37
NA,"River is 50 feet high, and the people at",37
NA,Wyandotte Station have been forced to,37
NA,"leave the homestead, because of the",37
NA,rapid rise of the river level. Rail and,37
NA,road traffic has been dislocated. Ten,37
NA,spans have been washed from one bridge.,37
NA,Dr Bradfield suggested that these,37
NA,"waters, taken at the 1,400 foot level,",37
NA,should be diverted by means of a tunnel,37
NA,conto Western Queensland. They could thus,37
NA,be directed to the head waters of l ie,37
NA,"Elinders River, which flow's in a",37
NA,"westerly direction, thus filling all the",37
NA,water courses and storage basins from,37
NA,Hughenden through Winton and Long-,37
NA,"reach, and down through Central Aus-",37
NA,tralia towards Lake Eyre. I t was sug-,37
NA,gested that the tropical downpours ex-,37
NA,perienced in far northern Queensland,37
NA,"should be utilized, so that the conserved",37
NA,water could be used in some of the finest,37
NA,pastoral country in Queensland. One,37
NA,recalls the valuable work done by the,37
NA,Chaffey brothers along the river Murray.,37
NA,Ernestine H i l l in her book Water into,37
NA,"Gold, tells the story of their trials and",37
NA,"tribulations and the success, which they",37
NA,eventually achieved. By water conserva-,37
NA,tion much can be done to improve the,37
NA,population-carrying capacity of Aus-,37
NA,tralia. I agree with the honorable mem-,37
NA,ber for Forrest that i f no action be,37
NA,taken to preserve our heritage Aus-,37
NA,book. tralia may not in the near future be,37
NA,able to carry even its present population.,37
NA,Dr Bradfield further suggested the,37
NA,storage of the waters that fall in the,37
NA,MACDonnell and Musgrave Ranges in,37
NA,"Glen Helen Gorge, Simpson's Gap, the",37
NA,Finke River and the Valley of the*,37
NA,"Palms, and their use for irrigation in",37
NA,Central Australia. He also proposed,37
NA,that dams should be built on the Cooper,37
NA,"River at Kullymurra Gorge, Innamincka,",37
NA,"in South Australia, backing up the water",37
NA,over an area of 100 miles by 40 miles,37
NA,beyond the .Queensland border. Similar,37
NA,dams could be constructed on Strezlecki,37
NA,"Creek, below Innamincka, at Hunter's",38
NA,"Gorge on the Diamantina, south-west",38
NA,"Winton, and on the Georgina near Marion Timbury's work-",38
NA,"Downs. In Western Australia, dams",38
NA,"could be built on the Ashburton, Fortesquent",38
NA,cue and other rivers. The honorable with,38
NA,member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Johnson) ocean,38
NA,has told the House what has already been,38
NA,done in (he north-west of Western Austain.,38
NA,"tralia, and has already indicated how the",38
NA,thousands of people could be settled on tained,38
NA,the land in that vulnerable area. An,38
NA,expert appointed by the Government of Australia,38
NA,Western Australia has been carrying out,38
NA,experiments in the northern portion of such,38
NA,that State. The honorable member gave,38
NA,an indication as to the carrying capaand,38
NA,"city of the Kimberleys, and the area that",38
NA,which would be served by the Bradfield the,38
NA,scheme. Dr Bradfield thought that,38
NA,water should be stored above ground.,38
NA,contended that the terrific heat i n,38
NA,part of Australia would evaporate,38
NA,enormous quantity of the stored water,38
NA,and that it would fall as rain.,38
NA,Dr Bradfield's conclusions have been,38
NA,"supported by Mr E. T. Quayle, an Austheir",38
NA,"tralian scientist, who has investigated",38
NA,rainfall problems and has made a study,38
NA,of inland Australia. Dr Griffith,38
NA,"Taylor, of the Commonwealth Bureau",38
NA,"Meteorology, in his Atlas of Contour and",38
NA,"Rainfall Map of Australia, issued by",38
NA,Council for Scientific and Industrial,38
NA,"Research in 1918, also supports the",38
NA,tention of Mr Quayle and Dr Bradfield,38
NA,that the enormous evaporation from,38
NA,large bodies of water will inevitably preIdriess,38
NA,cipitate rain and bring about a humidity,38
NA,from which dew would be precipitated,38
NA,the benefit of vegetation. In western,38
NA,Queensland artesian water is used for,38
NA,stock purposes but great difficulty is,38
NA,"perienced in drought periods, when",38
NA,there is insufficient rain to produce,38
NA,herbage necessary to maintain flocks,38
NA,herds. As was pointed out by Dr Bradwaters,38
NA,"-field, much of the water which falls",38
NA,rain seeps away and eventually reaches,38
NA,the artesian basins. Much of the water,38
NA,stored in the canals would be evaporated.,38
NA,"Tbis would produce humidity, and a",38
NA,reduction of the mean average temperathern,38
NA,ture. Living conditions would then,38
NA,much more tolerable than they are,38
NA,"the present time, particularly in the",38
NA,Mr Riordan.,38
NA,summer months of* the year. I quote,38
NA,"of Bradfield's summing-up, published in",38
NA,Thunderstorms would become more fre-,38
NA,when the inland air is better supplied,38
NA,"moisture, or, when winds blow over the",38
NA,"sea, added moisture of the air from off the",38
NA,would augment the inland moisture and,38
NA,make the precipitation of the rain nioTe cer-,38
NA,I n this way the water conserved will be,38
NA,"used over and over again, and moisture in",38
NA,arid inland w i l l be augmented and main-,38
NA,at such a level that the rainfall w i l l,38
NA,"slowly, at first, but steadily progress. Once",38
NA,has irrigation schemes numerous and,38
NA,comprehensive enough to make an impression,38
NA,favorable to the country in the areas where,38
NA,"schemes are practicable, the amelioration",38
NA,will become marked. The converse is likewise,38
NA,"true. Droughts are cumulative in their results,",38
NA,as long as there are no projects completed,38
NA,are of sufficient size to combat and master,38
NA,"drought conditions, they w i l l prevail, and",38
NA,the become emphasized year by year.,38
NA,He The present drought in the western dis-,38
NA,that trict of New South Wales is regarded,38
NA,an as the worst experienced since 1902.,38
NA,"Apparently, this bears out Bradfield's",38
NA,contention that drought conditions become,38
NA,more emphasized year after year unless,38
NA,large projects are undertaken to mitigate,38
NA,effects. I urge the Government to,38
NA,"investigate these schemes, not cast them",38
NA,aside as an opium smoker's dream. Argu-,38
NA,ments have been advanced for and against,38
NA,of the proposals. I shall not attempt to,38
NA,canvass any of them; that is a task for an,38
NA,the expert. Too many newspaper correspon-,38
NA,dents condemn such projects out of hand.,38
NA,conThey pose as authorities upon matters,38
NA,on which they have not the necessary,38
NA,qualifications to express an opinion.,38
NA,"is a well-known Australian author,",38
NA,"digger, traveller and prospector, with a",38
NA,to wide knowledge and experience of this,38
NA,"continent. I n The Great Boomerang, he",38
NA,suggests that the waters should be taken,38
NA,exfrom the same area and turned into the,38
NA,"same rivers as Bradfield mentioned., but",38
NA,"the at a much lower level. His view is,",38
NA,and that in central Queensland the flood-,38
NA,"of the Bellyando, Mackenzie and",38
NA,as other rivers should he diverted into the,38
NA,"Thompson and the Barcoo, which flow",38
NA,"past Longreach, thus augmenting the",38
NA,supply of water to central Australia. He,38
NA,also suggests that the waters of the nor-,38
NA,rivers which flow into the Gulf,38
NA,be of Carpentaria should be diverted into,38
NA,at the Diamantina and other rivers which,38
NA,flow in the direction of Lake Eyre. He,38
NA,contends that this diversion would make,39
NA,"it possible for all storage basins, includ-",39
NA,"ing Lake Eyre and even beyond, to be",39
NA,"filled, and that the resultant stream",39
NA,would find its way to within 65 miles of,39
NA,the coast ofi South Australia. I have,39
NA,heard it suggested that water should,39
NA,be pumped from New Guinea to central,39
NA,Australia. I am not qualified either to,39
NA,support or to oppose such a scheme.,39
NA,"Bradfield proposed to divert 5,000,000,000",39
NA,tons of water annually into western,39
NA,"Queensland, and Idriess proposed the",39
NA,"diversion of a further 5,000,000,000 tons.",39
NA,I t has been argued that the building of,39
NA,a tunnel would present difficulties. There,39
NA,are tunnels i n other parts of the world.,39
NA,The St. Gothard tunnel is 9£ miles in,39
NA,"length, and the iSimplon tunnel has a",39
NA,length of 12$ miles. American engineers,39
NA,"have tunnelled under the Hudson River,",39
NA,and through the Rockies and the Andes.,39
NA,"I n Colorado, water has been diverted into",39
NA,"the arid Montrose district, through a",39
NA,number ofi tunnels 6 miles in length. I n,39
NA,"India, the Solani acqueduct, 65 yards",39
NA,"wide, carries the Ganges canal over the",39
NA,"Solani River. I n Russia, Moscow and",39
NA,other inland towns have become seaports,39
NA,by virtue of the construction of canals,39
NA,from the Baltic to the Black Sea. The,39
NA,"Tennessee dam, constructed by the Ten-",39
NA,"nessee Valley Authority, was financed",39
NA,wholly by the Government of the United,39
NA,States of America. I n the Tennessee,39
NA,"valley the water is backed up for 1,100",39
NA,miles. The height of the highest dam is,39
NA,"800 feet, and that of the lowest is 300",39
NA,the drop of 500 feet being spread over,39
NA,650 miles. The objects of the schemes,39
NA,"propounded by Bradfield and Idriess were,",39
NA,to minimize the effects of drought by,39
NA,"conserving rainfall, halt, the extension",39
NA,of the dust bowl by preventing soil,39
NA,"erosion, and above all assist the develop-",39
NA,ment of the inland portions of the con-,39
NA,"tinent. I f an investigation of them, led",39
NA,"to a favorable report being made, no",39
NA,time should be lost in implementing them.,39
NA,"""We know full well that there are difficul-",39
NA,ties of man-power and supply. I f these,39
NA,"are insuperable at present, this should be",39
NA,one of the first post-war projects to be,39
NA,put in hand. I am confident that,39
NA,an investigation would establish the,39
NA,soundness and worth of the proposals.,39
NA,The average Australian rainfall is,39
NA,"about 18 inches; 32 per cent, of Aus-",39
NA,tralia has a rainfall of more than,39
NA,"20 inches, 32 per cent, an average of from",39
NA,"10 inches to 20 inches, and about 36",39
NA,"per cent, under 10 inches. I f other",39
NA,"countries can undertake such schemes,",39
NA,we should be prepared to do likewise.,39
NA,Diversion of waters as suggested by Brad-,39
NA,field and Idriess would make possible the,39
NA,irrigation of some of the best pastoral,39
NA,"lands of Queensland, which will grow",39
NA,anything. I know the country thoroughly.,39
NA,"I t has open rolling downs, with black",39
NA,soil feet thick in some portions of it.,39
NA,"I n other parts, the soil is a sandy loam.",39
NA,I have been informed by one who ought,39
NA,to be able to speak authoritatively that,39
NA,the area through which this water would,39
NA,pass is much more fertile than the area,39
NA,served by the Tennessee valley dam. Yet,39
NA,"we are hesitant, because the estimated",39
NA,"cost of the project is about £30,000,000.",39
NA,"Year in and year out, millions of pounds",39
NA,"is lost as the result o£ drought, and",39
NA,millions of acres of land is blown to sea.,39
NA,"I f these schemes were implemented, those",39
NA,who are carrying on the pastoral indus-,39
NA,try would be able to plant and conserve,39
NA,"fodder, and they would not feel the effects",39
NA,"of drought as they do to-day, when i t is",39
NA,not possible for them to secure the water,39
NA,"that they need, or to be assured of rain-",39
NA,fall which would enable fodder crops to,39
NA,be harvested. Agriculture could be,39
NA,developed in country which to-day is,39
NA,devoted wholly and solely to pastoral,39
NA,"feet, pursuits. We have seen what has hap-",39
NA,"pened at Griffith and Leeton, where the",39
NA,supply of water led to the springing up,39
NA,of new towns and the establishment of,39
NA,new industries. We mouth platitudes,39
NA,about the decentralization of population,39
NA,"and industry after the war, but I know",39
NA,that development along those lines is,39
NA,part and parcel of the Government's,39
NA,post-war policy. The inland is crying,39
NA,"out for development. Timbury, in his",39
NA,"book, appeals to the people of Aus-",39
NA,tralia to realize that they are facing a,39
NA,calamity. I f effect were given to the,39
NA,schemes proposed by these two great,39
NA,"Australians, we should go a long way",39
NA,towards mitigating the effects of any,39
NA,impending calamity. Decentralization,39
NA,of population would follow. The drift,39
NA,of population from western Queensland,40
NA,has been very marked for a long period.,40
NA,"I f water were diverted to the west, that",40
NA,portion of the continent would be revita-,40
NA,"lized, and population would return to it.",40
NA,We should also be able to sustain a policy,40
NA,"of migration, and carry out works of",40
NA,vital national importance.,40
NA,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,40
Mr RIORDAN ,Ther e is a great,40
NA,shortage of houses throughout the Com-,40
NA,monwealth. I can speak feelingly on,40
NA,this subject because I myself have been,40
NA,ti victim of that shortage. Much has,40
NA,"been said and written on the subject, and",40
NA,I am aware that the demand on our,40
NA,timber stocks for defence purposes is so,40
NA,great that timber has to be imported.,40
NA,".1 know, too, that there is a great shortage",40
NA,"of building trade workers, due to the fact",40
NA,that so many artisans are either in the,40
NA,fighting services or are engaged on high,40
NA,priority defence work. By the time that,40
NA,"the present shortage of 300,000 houses is",40
NA,"met, probably another 200,000 will be",40
NA,required. [Extension of time granted.],40
NA,I realize that in time of war. the para-,40
NA,mount consideration must be the defence,40
NA,"of the country, but in time of peace the",40
NA,first consideration should be the health,40
NA,and well-being of the community. Proper,40
NA,housing is essential to a healthy nation.,40
NA,I well recall a conversation which I had,40
NA,"some years ago with Dr Watson Brown,",40
NA,"who was then practising at Longreach,",40
NA,in western Queensland. He told me that,40
NA,he had carried out an investigation of the,40
NA,health of the children in western Queens-,40
NA,"land, and in the course of our talk he",40
NA,pictured the conditions under which,40
NA,women in northern and western Queens-,40
NA,hind had to live and work in corrugated,40
NA,"iron cottages. I n the summer time,",40
NA,"when the temperature is high, the cook-",40
NA,ing of a meal on a hot stove is not a,40
NA,pleasant job. The appalling housing,40
NA,conditions which exist in many of the,40
NA,outback parts of the Commonwealth,40
NA,"should be remedied, and I am glad that",40
NA,the present Government proposes to,40
NA,tuekle this problem in a national way,40
NA,by the introduction of a Commonwealth,40
NA,housing scheme. Some years ago the,40
NA,Bruce-Page Government won an election,40
NA,on its promise to provide houses for,40
NA,the people. I t is true that legislation,40
NA,"was passed, but nothing was done to",40
NA,implement it. The present Government,40
NA,has not only promised to provide houses,40
NA,"for those in need of them, but i t has also",40
NA,appointed a Housing Commission to pre-,40
NA,pare a practicable housing scheme. Some,40
NA,members of that body visited north,40
NA,"Queensland, but unfortunately they did",40
NA,not visit the western part of that State.,40
NA,"L'n my opinion, housing conditions in",40
NA,western Queensland should be investi-,40
NA,"gated, and I appeal to the Government",40
NA,to arrange for that to be done. I n,40
NA,designing houses it is important that,40
NA,the district in which they are to,40
NA,be erected shall be considered. Many,40
NA,architects with a knowledge of cli-,40
NA,matic conditions in and around Brisbane,40
NA,may know nothing of the conditions which,40
NA,"obtain at Cairns, .1,100 miles farther",40
NA,north. As Cairns is as far from Bris-,40
NA,"bane as is Melbourne, honorable mem-",40
NA,bers will realize how -greatly the climatic,40
NA,conditions of Cairns and Melbourne must,40
NA,differ. Houses are being built at Cairns,40
NA,"under the Commonwealth scheme, but,",40
NA,"unfortunately, they are not suitable for",40
NA,tropical regions. The by-laws of the,40
NA,Cairns City Council provide for a,40
NA,mean height of 10 feet between floor and,40
NA,"ceiling, but the houses which are being",40
NA,erected there by the commission have only,40
NA,9-ft. walls. Most houses in the district,40
NA,have 12 feet between floor and ceiling.,40
NA,Some years ago the Queensland Govern-,40
NA,ment established a Workers Dwellings,40
NA,"Department, and remarkably good work",40
NA,has been done by that body. Recently,40
NA,it has been re-organized with a view,40
NA,to undertaking an extended building pro-,40
NA,gramme. As a result of its activities,40
NA,the percentage of workers who own their,40
NA,"own homes, or are buying homes, is",40
NA,greater in Queensland than in any other,40
NA,State. I congratulate the Government,40
NA,on the introduction of its housing,40
NA,scheme.,40
NA,The Speech ofi His Royal Highness,40
NA,shows that tlie foresight and courage,40
NA,which have characterized the Government,40
NA,hitherto will be applied to the problems,40
NA,of the future. At the last elections the,40
NA,Government was given the greatest vote,40
NA,of confidence ever accorded to any govern-,40
NA,"ment, and, when the next appeal is made",40
NA,"to the electors, I am confident that an",40
NA,even more striking indication of their,40
NA,confidence i n the Government will be,41
NA,given. Everywhere that I go throughout,41
NA,the Commonwealth I hear people say,41
NA,that they intend to continue to support,41
NA,the Curtin Government. The workers,41
NA,desire the Government to carry on with,41
NA,"its good work, and at the next elections",41
NA,the Government will be given another,41
NA,mandate.,41
Mr ABBOTT ,Ha s the honorable mem-,41
NA,ber anything to say on the Government's,41
NA,banking proposals?,41
Mr RIORDAN , The Standing,41
NA,Orders do not permit me to anticipate,41
NA,the debate on a subject already on the,41
NA,notice-paper.,41
NA,When the Menzies Government occu-,41
NA,pied the treasury bench we heard and,41
NA,also read a good deal in the press of the,41
NA,"need for a "" new order "", but to-day very",41
NA,"little is said about a "" new order"",",41
NA,although we hear howls about socialism.,41
NA,The emaciated socialist tiger has been,41
NA,dug up from the political cemetery. Al l,41
NA,the old party political clap-trap is,41
NA,wheeled out again by the Opposition in,41
NA,an attempt to gull the people. I am con-,41
NA,fident that i f the policy outlined in the,41
NA,Speech of His Royal Highness is put into,41
NA,operation the verdict of the people given,41
NA,at the last elections will be repeated and,41
NA,with greater emphasis when the next,41
NA,appeal to them is made.,41
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,Barker),41
NA,[8.11] -Th e arrival of a Royal Go-,41
NA,"vernor-General in this country, is",41
NA,new to Australian political history.,41
NA,As one who descended from the,41
NA,"Jacobites, I welcome the brother of",41
NA,"the King. I n due course, after His Royal",41
NA,Highness has carried out the duties,41
NA,assigned to him in a manner befitting a,41
NA,"member of the present Royal Family, I",41
NA,suppose that the Commonwealth will have,41
NA,another Governor-General; and some of,41
NA,us look forward with interest to what,41
NA,will happen then. I shall not discuss that,41
NA,"matter now, but honorable members oppo-",41
NA,site will know what I mean.,41
NA,I desire to refer particularly to two,41
NA,"matters, first, the position which con-",41
NA,"fronts us in regard to external affairs,",41
NA,"and, secondly, the control and use of the",41
NA,Australian Army. Since the war began,41
NA,there has been an extensive development,41
NA,ofi the external activities of the Common-,41
NA,wealth. We have sent Ministers and,41
NA,High Commissioners to many countries,41
NA,to which we had not thought of sending,41
NA,representatives when war broke out five,41
NA,and a half years ago. That development,41
NA,hastaken place without any debate in,41
NA,this Parliament. Very little attention,41
NA,has been paid by either House of the,41
NA,"Parliament to an activity which, for good",41
NA,"or i l l , will affect the future of Australia",41
NA,for several generations. I t stands second,41
NA,only in importance to certain aspects of,41
NA,the conduct ofi the present war. We have,41
NA,now gone so far along the road to victory,41
NA,that we can form some idea of what the,41
NA,state of the world will be after our,41
NA,enemies have been defeated. Two years,41
NA,ago we could not safely have done so.,41
NA,The future of the British Empire is our,41
NA,first concern. I t has been proved - I,41
NA,hope to the satisfaction of every honor-,41
NA,able member in this chamber-tha t the,41
NA,"security of the Commonwealth, so far as",41
NA,"we can foresee the future, lies in our",41
NA,membership of the British Empire or the,41
NA,British Commonwealth of Nations. Call,41
NA,it what you like. I t is only a matter,41
NA,"of names. I prefer the old name,",41
NA,""" British Empire "", under which I was",41
NA,brought up. Every development in tbe,41
NA,war or the realm of external affairs,41
NA,proves the absolute necessity for better,41
NA,understanding and very much closer co-,41
NA,operation between the British Dominions,41
NA,and the Motherland than has existed,41
NA,up to date. That co-operation has to,41
NA,be based on complete freedom and on a,41
NA,complete understanding of our own re-,41
NA,quirements and those of the other,41
NA,dominions. I believe that can be,41
NA,achieved. Last year the Prime Minister,41
NA,( Mr Curtin) went to London and took,41
NA,part in certain imperial discussions- I,41
NA,"hope, for the benefit of this country. We",41
NA,fully realize that under war-time condi-,41
NA,tions we cannot be told publicly so much,41
NA,about some things as we may desire to,41
NA,hear. The conditions that will prevail,41
NA,after this war will affect the British,41
NA,"Empire vitally. At one time, we were",41
NA,all very proud to belong to an Empire,41
NA,on which the sun never sets. Its vast,41
NA,spread was considered to be a great safe-,41
NA,guard. To-day i t has other implications.,41
NA,The British Empire contains elements of,41
NA,"great danger, unless the situation, is",41
NA,properly handled. Means of communi-,41
NA,cation and the speed of transport have,41
NA,increased under war-time conditions;,42
NA,the inventive genius of man always,42
NA,finds scope in inventing means of,42
NA,"destruction, at a greater rate and i n a",42
NA,better way than in peace-time. That has,42
NA,"been true of air transport in this war,",42
NA,"was true in the war of 1914-18, and I",42
NA,think that it would prove to be true,42
NA,if the next generation were unfortunate,42
NA,enough to be involved in another war,42
NA,20 or 30 years hence. The British,42
NA,Dominions are dispersed throughout the,42
NA,"world. They must live dispersed lives,",42
NA,according to their individual conditions.,42
NA,"The cardinal principle, which I want",42
NA,"the House to realize, is that henceforth",42
NA,there must be no half-measures and that,42
NA,Great Britain and the Dominions must be,42
NA,in a condition whereby they can unite for,42
NA,defence against any possible combination,42
NA,of powers which may face them. When,42
NA,"this war broke out, it is undeniable",42
NA,that that state of affairs did not exist.,42
NA,"Many people, particularly on the other",42
NA,"side of the House, absolutely scouted",42
NA,the idea of the necessity of any arrange-,42
NA,ment of that sort or the likelihood of,42
NA,war in our time. They proved to be,42
NA,quite wrong.,42
NA,The next important point in the field,42
NA,of external relations is the position that,42
NA,will be occupied by two other great,42
NA,Powers after the war. The first is the,42
NA,United States of America. Before the,42
NA,war it exercised great control from the,42
NA,Arctic to the Antarctic through the two,42
NA,"Americas; but after the war, as the",42
NA,"result of bases which it has acquired,",42
NA,"and, I believe, will acquire in conse-",42
NA,quence of the peace treaties when they,42
NA,"are signed, it will have not only a north-",42
NA,"south territorial area to look after, but",42
NA,also a great sea responsibility extending,42
NA,from the East Indies eastward through,42
NA,the Panama Canal to the West Indies.,42
NA,"In other words, it will possess land and",42
NA,sea power over one-half of the globe. It,42
NA,will have great responsibilities in all,42
NA,areas in which it is concerned. The other,42
NA,change will be that which has taken place,42
NA,in the position of the Union of Soviet-,42
NA,Socialist Republics as the result,42
NA,of the progress of the war. It alone,42
NA,of the three great Powers is determined,42
NA,to extend its territories in many direc-,42
NA,"tions, a striking contrast to the inter-",42
NA,national attitude of ourselves and that of,42
NA,Mr Archie Cameron.,42
NA,the United States of America. No one,42
NA,questions that the English-speaking,42
NA,countries of the world are endeavouring,42
NA,to produce a state of affairs in which,42
NA,the small nations will have equal rights,42
NA,"as it with the great nations, in which",42
NA,their peoples will be able to live in,42
NA,"security, to own their lands, to trade,",42
NA,"to develop industries, perhaps to migrate",42
NA,and to invest abroad under conditions,42
NA,which will be pre-eminently satisfactory,42
NA,to them. I refer particularly to some,42
NA,of the nations in Europe. But that is,42
NA,not the basis on which Russian foreign,42
NA,policy is f ounded. To-day on the eastern,42
NA,frontier we see a line of occupations and,42
NA,what will probably be annexures run-,42
NA,"ning through Finland, Latvia, Estonia,",42
NA,"Lithuania, Poland, Hungary and",42
NA,"Rumania, and we do not know whether",42
NA,they will rest just there. So that cardinal,42
NA,fact must be borne in mind by all Aus-,42
NA,tralians i f they are to have a clear grasp,42
NA,of what may emerge from the forth-,42
NA,coming peace conference. Too many,42
NA,of our people do not fully under-,42
NA,stand the external affairs problem. I t,42
NA,is not merely a matter of relationship,42
NA,between us and some other country per,42
NA,medium of a Minister or a High Com-,42
NA,missioner. I t goes much deeper than,42
NA,that. I t involves very much more than,42
NA,everyday affairs. There are problems of,42
NA,"communications, transport, trade and",42
NA,"commerce barriers, immigration laws,",42
NA,"airlines, postal services and all that",42
NA,"sort of thing, which are emin-",42
NA,ently bound up with the prob-,42
NA,lem of external affairs. So as we en-,42
NA,deavour to put into force a policy which,42
NA,impinges on the spheres of influences of,42
NA,any other nation in any of. those respects,42
NA,we begin to trespass. Before long we,42
NA,shall require to give consideration to the,42
NA,result of the deliberations at the Dum-,42
NA,barton Oaks 'and the Bretton Woods,42
NA,"conferences, the nature of which",42
NA,I am not able to ascertain. I have,42
NA,applied to the External Affairs Depart-,42
NA,"ment, through the Minister, a couple of",42
NA,times for information. I t has been pro-,42
NA,"mised, but I have not yet received it.",42
NA,Whether other honorable gentlemen are,42
NA,"better informed, I do not know. That",42
NA,observation leads me to this. I want,42
NA,the Government sooner or later to face,42
NA,this question-I s its idea of post-war,42
NA,problems to be based on the practice of,43
NA,open diplomacy or secret diplomacy?,43
NA,That is question No. 1.,43
NA,NA,43
NA,able member advise?,43
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON , I am,43
NA,not giving my policy at the moment. No,43
NA,"doubt, after the honorable member comes",43
NA,"back from San Erancisco, he will be only",43
NA,too anxious to give his advice.,43
Mr CONELAN ,D o not be jealous.,43
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON , I am,43
NA,"not a bit jealous. ""We need to decide",43
NA,whether we shall adopt a system of open,43
NA,or secret diplomacy. The Commonwealth,43
NA,Parliament has not discussed that vital,43
NA,matter. That brings to a head the,43
NA,question whether we are to have private,43
NA,"negotiation for trade treaties, and that",43
NA,sort of thing. They are intimately bound,43
NA,together. A fair proportion of the time,43
NA,we spend talking here should be regularly,43
NA,devoted to developments in the realm of,43
NA,"external affairs, but that is not done.",43
NA,Such debate is squeezed out by the sys-,43
NA,tem under which we work. Time is taken,43
NA,up with questions. Ministers make most,43
NA,important pronouncements on foreign,43
NA,"relations, move that the papers be printed,",43
NA,and never allow the subjects involved to,43
NA,be debated until the day on which Parlia-,43
NA,ment adjourns. That is not a state of,43
NA,affairs under which there can be intelli-,43
NA,gent understanding of external affairs. I,43
NA,do not go so far as to say that our men-,43
NA,"tality is atrophied by the system, but, i f",43
NA,more time is not devoted by this Par-,43
NA,liament to th© all-important problem,43
NA,"of international affairs, it may .easily",43
NA,become atrophied. We see important,43
NA,documents laid before us as last year we,43
NA,had laid before us the famous Australian-,43
NA,"New Zealand Agreement, known as",43
NA,"the ""Anzac Pact"". I will not go",43
NA,"into the merits of that agreement, for",43
NA,I doubt whether i t has any. I t was t,43
NA,signed i n this chamber beneath kleig,43
NA,lights and before moving picture cameras.,43
NA,The Minister for Transport ( Mr Ward),43
NA,took several minutes to read i t through,43
NA,"before he would sign it, but no time has",43
NA,ever been devoted by this House to its,43
NA,consideration. I raise that point specific-,43
NA,"ally, because i t is known that two senior",43
NA,Commonwealth Ministers have lately,43
NA,left for the other side of the world.,43
NA,We know that they are going to an,43
NA,Imperial conference to be held somewhere.,43
NA,Afterwards they will go to a conference,43
NA,at San Erancisco which will be attended,43
NA,by the representatives of certain nations.,43
NA,When those Ministers come back,43
NA,they must bring reports to Parlia-,43
NA,ment. Are we to have a state of affairs,43
NA,in which those matters will not be dis-,43
NA,cussed in this House. I n days gone by,43
NA,that system did not prevail. One of,43
NA,the most important intra-Imperial docu-,43
NA,ments ever signed was the Ottawa Agree-,43
NA,"ment, but that was the subject of many",43
NA,days' debate before it became law as a,43
NA,schedule to an act of this Parliament.,43
NA,The next thing to which I refer is,43
NA,the question of the negotiation or im-,43
NA,position ofi peace. I am not sure which,43
NA,word will be best suited to the event.,43
NA,None of us may be very well informed on,43
NA,that. Perhaps honorable gentlemen on,43
NA,the treasury bench will not be much better,43
NA,informed than we shall be. We read a,43
NA,lot in the press and hear discussions over,43
NA,the air about whether we should have a,43
NA,soft peace or a hard peace. I am not,43
NA,"moved, by either adjective. I f we are to",43
NA,avoid a recurrence of what the world has,43
NA,suffered over the last five and a half years,43
NA,what is needed is that the peace shall be,43
NA,just and nothing else. That is the im-,43
NA,portant thing. Therefore the part that,43
NA,we are to play in the negotiations or the,43
NA,part that we are to play after the terms,43
NA,have been decided by other powers is,43
NA,something to which this House should,43
NA,"pay some attention, because we may very",43
NA,easily be caught up in events over which,43
NA,"we have exercised no supervision, and to",43
NA,which we have given no thought. I t,43
NA,will be too late for the Commonwealth,43
NA,"Government to say after the event: "" That",43
NA,"is very unfortunate, but certain things",43
NA,have been done and we were not fully,43
NA,informed or did not fully inform Parlia-,43
NA,"ment "". I t stands to reason, in my view,",43
NA,tbat the very first thing in any peace terms,43
NA,which will be negotiated or imposed after,43
NA,the war is what is to be done about naval,43
NA,"armament. My own view, perhaps not",43
NA,"orthodox, but not without historical justi-",43
NA,"fication, is that in the present state",43
NA,of the world there is no necessity,43
NA,for the maintenance of naval arma-,43
NA,ments by more than two powers.,43
NA,Those two powers are Great Britain,44
NA,and the United States of America. I t,44
NA,would he in the interest of world peace i f,44
NA,the naval policing of the world were en-,44
NA,trusted to those two powers. ' We should,44
NA,not then have the set of circumstances,44
NA,which has faced the world for a long,44
NA,time under which there tends to grow,44
NA,"up between great powers, or between",44
NA,"small powers, a competition in the pro-",44
NA,"vision of naval armaments for defence,",44
NA,"or offence, as the case may be. These two",44
NA,powers have proved through their record,44
NA,during this war that neither is out for,44
NA,"territorial aggrandizement, or the con-",44
NA,quest of any other country. Each is. out,44
NA,"to secure only its own, and to see that the",44
NA,inoffensive peoples of Europe and other,44
NA,countries in the world are left to live,44
NA,and develop in peace. Wherever the,44
NA,Navy at any time of the world's history,44
NA,lias entered into defence operations i t,44
NA,has had a very important bearing on the,44
NA,outcome of any war in which it has been,44
NA,"able to engage. Holding those views, I",44
NA,believe that it is advisable that there,44
NA,should not be any competition in naval,44
NA,armament when the war is over.,44
NA,The next point that comes up for con-,44
NA,sideration is what is known as the Atlantic,44
NA,Charter. In that respect I do not know,44
NA,where the Commonwealth of Australia,44
NA,stands to-day. There was a lot said about,44
NA,the Atlantic Charter from the treasury,44
NA,"bench not so many months ago, but for",44
NA,the past few months there has 'been a very,44
NA,significant silence indeed. I should be,44
NA,very much intrigued to know whether all,44
NA,powers allied and associated with us at,44
NA,present have accepted the principles of,44
NA,"the Atlantic Charter, and whether such",44
NA,powers have agreed to carry out its prin-,44
NA,"ciples, particularly with, respect to",44
NA,tries which some of them are overrunning,44
NA,to-day. No man can read the terms of,44
NA,"peace to which Rumania or Finland has,",44
NA,".agreed, and to which it appears Poland,",44
NA,"will be compelled to agree, without",44
NA,feeling in his heart that there has,44
NA,been a serious and violent violation,44
NA,of one of the most important terms of,44
NA,the Atlantic Charter. That is the freedom,44
NA,under which people are to decide their,44
NA,"own form of government, and the allegi-",44
NA,ance they will offer to other governments.,44
NA,The Polish question has been referred to,44
NA,in this House. I recall the debate which,44
NA,Mr Archie Cameron.,44
NA,"took place on external affairs in May,",44
NA,"1939, before the war broke out. On that",44
NA,occasion I told the House why I was,44
NA,opposed to the Polish guarantee. I t was,44
NA,for the simple reason that we were going,44
NA,to sign a guarantee which we could never,44
NA,carry out; and that has been proved by,44
NA,events. Whatever may be our feelings,44
NA,"with regard to the Polish question, the",44
NA,future of Poland will not be decided by,44
NA,what the English-speaking peoples of the,44
NA,world think to be right or just. The,44
NA,"future of Poland, is being decided else-",44
NA,"where, just as the future of Rumania,",44
NA,Hungary and some other countries are,44
NA,being decided by the same people in the,44
NA,same place. One of the cardinal lessons,44
NA,of world history is this: a country like,44
NA,East Prussia cannot be taken and handed,44
NA,over to a foreign country. We,44
NA,cannot settle a problem of that,44
NA,"kind by simply saying that, wc are",44
NA,going to give a part of Poland to,44
NA,"Russia, and compensate Poland by hand-",44
NA,ing over to it part of East Prussia. We,44
NA,know the story of the lost provinces in,44
NA,northern Italy; and we know what,44
NA,Alsace-Lorraine means between France,44
NA,and 'Germany. Is i t to be the deliberate,44
NA,policy of one of the three great Allies,44
NA,in this war that it will create another,44
NA,"problem, another festering cancer, on the",44
NA,Baltic of. the type that must result under,44
NA,the conditions which we understand are,44
NA,to be imposed? I t is with great regret,44
NA,"that I refer to a matter like this, because",44
NA,I realize as well as any other honorable,44
NA,"member that the fate of Poland, or any",44
NA,"of the Balkan or Baltic States, is not",44
NA,going to be determined by anything we,44
NA,sav here. I t is not; but we are parties,44
NA,to certain international agreements. We,44
NA,coun- did accept the Atlantic Charter; and,44
NA,some people will want to know exactly,44
NA,what we propose to do ahout it. I t is a,44
NA,-question which we cannot answer by,44
NA,shelving it. I t will come up for solution,44
NA,in due course.,44
NA,The next point is with respect to the,44
NA,part that Unrra is to play i n the rehabili-,44
NA,tation of the devastated countries. I do,44
NA,not think that a bill was ever introduced,44
NA,into this Parliament with more fanfare,44
NA,of trumpets and greater show than was,44
NA,the case in respect of that bill. I t went,44
NA,through this House without a proper,44
NA,explanation. With the cast-iron majority,44
NA,"whicli tbe Government has, and which is",45
NA,as subservient as any. majority possibly,45
NA,"could be, it stands to reason that any",45
NA,"measure the Government introduces,",45
NA,which receives not only the ministerial,45
NA,imprimatur but also the imprimatur of,45
NA,"caucus, is .bound to become the law of this",45
NA,country.,45
NA,Mr BuitKii -W e shall hear to-morrow,45
NA,from honorable members opposite that a,45
NA,wild caucus dominates the Cabinet.,45
NA,"Mr ARCHIE CAMERON"" -When -",45
NA,ever I look at the Opposition benches,45
NA,I feel that I am looking at some of the,45
NA,members of the proposed advisory coun-,45
NA,cil of the Commonwealth Bank. The,45
NA,measure relating to TJnrra had hardly,45
NA,become law when the Attorney-General,45
NA,"(Dr Evatt) who introduced it, and",45
NA,recommended it to this House in un-,45
NA,"qualified terms, went to Lapstone, in",45
NA,"New South Wales, and made some of the",45
NA,most scathing comments about that or-,45
NA,ganization that could have been made by,45
NA,any responsible Minister. The Attorney-,45
NA,"General has disappeared to parts, per-",45
NA,"haps, unknown, but the identity of",45
NA,which we may guess; but there has been,45
NA,no explanation from the right honorable,45
NA,gentleman as to why he went to Lap-,45
NA,stone and gave such a thorough thrashing,45
NA,to his very favoured infant then only a,45
NA,few weeks old.,45
Mr ABBOTT ,H e wanted to draw,45
NA,attention from the Government.,45
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON , I think,45
NA,that he was more inclined to focus atten-,45
NA,tion on himself than to draw it from the,45
NA,Government. That is something which,45
NA,"the Attorney-General at some future date,",45
NA,if his onerous duties of puttingthe United,45
NA,"States of America, the United King-",45
NA,"dom, Russia and China in proper order",45
NA,will allow him to attend to matters like,45
NA,"this, might very well use for the instruc-",45
NA,tion and edification of this chamber.,45
NA,One of the important terms of peace,45
NA,to which I referred in passing concerned,45
NA,East Prussia. There will be a lot of talk,45
NA,"as to what we are to do with Germany,",45
NA,Italy and Japan. I f there is to be any,45
NA,"chance of security in the post-war world,",45
NA,one of the important things that must be,45
NA,undertaken is the national control of the,45
NA,armaments industry.,45
Mr CONELAN ,Socialism .,45
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,Honor -,45
NA,able members opposite need not get ex-,45
NA,"cited. One practice which, no doubt, has",45
NA,been conducive towards the breeding of,45
NA,military disturbance in certain of the,45
NA,smaller countries has been the export of,45
NA,armaments from several of the bigger,45
NA,"countries. My own personal view, which",45
NA,honorable gentlemen can take for what,45
NA,it is worth-an d I am not endeavouring,45
NA,to speak for the party to which I,45
NA,belong,45
Mr SHEEHAN ,Wha t party is that?,45
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON , I have,45
NA,"been in five parties in eighteen, years.",45
NA,"I n fact it is one of the points, perhaps,",45
NA,on which I should qualify to challenge,45
NA,"the Prime Minister of Great Britain,",45
NA,because I doubt i f he has been in so many,45
NA,"parties. I f I had my way, the export of",45
NA,arms from countries like Great Britain,45
NA,and the United States of America ought,45
NA,to be prohibited by the governments of,45
NA,those countries. This is a matter to,45
NA,which the 'Commonwealth Parliament,45
NA,"also ought to devote some attention, be-",45
NA,cause we have a right to put our case on,45
NA,the matter before an Imperial Conference.,45
NA,I believe that the strongest way of giving,45
NA,effect to the policy of Australia will be,45
NA,by holding more conferences between the,45
NA,"Dominions arid the Motherland, and",45
NA,thereat arriving at uniform policies be-,45
NA,fore entering international conferences.,45
NA,We should go into international confer-,45
NA,"ences as a united British Empire, deter-",45
NA,mined on some line of policy. We should,45
NA,not go into such conferences as so many,45
NA,different British communities who have,45
NA,"not agreed upon anything, but can only",45
NA,say that we agree to differ. A disunited,45
NA,British Empire after this war is over will,45
NA,be a menace to the peace and security of,45
NA,"the world, just as I believe that a similar",45
NA,"menace will be the right of any company,",45
NA,"or government, to export arms outside",45
NA,the country in which they are manu-,45
NA,factured.,45
NA,The forthcoming conference at San,45
NA,Erancisco may be looked upon as a kind,45
NA,of prologue to world peace. I do not,45
NA,know. I have my doubts as to when,45
NA,peace will actually be declared. After the,45
NA,"fighting ceases, there might be a long",45
NA,"period i f not of anarchy, at any rate oi",45
NA,"great internal disturbance, in many of",45
NA,"the countries which have been overrun,",45
NA,"and, of course, in the conquered countries",46
NA,with which we are at war to-day. That,46
NA,is inevitable. I also put it to honorable,46
NA,members that before we are through with,46
NA,"the war, notwithstanding what the news-",46
NA,"papers now say, the German Army might",46
NA,give a very different ^twist to the meaning,46
NA,of Fortress Europe from that which we,46
NA,have had up to date. The ground now,46
NA,being approached by the Allies on,46
NA,the Western Front lends itself to,46
NA,"easy defence. Therefore, I am not",46
NA,"satisfied that the war is going to end on,",46
NA,"say, Friday week. The representatives of",46
NA,many governments are to meet in San,46
NA,"Francisco, but so far as I am able to",46
NA,"judge, there is no informed world opinion",46
NA,as to what they should do. So far as the,46
NA,representatives of this country are con-,46
NA,cerned-an d I do not say this in a party,46
NA,"political, or personal, sense-ther e is no",46
NA,informed opinion in the 'Commonwealth,46
NA,of Australia as to what ought to be done,46
NA,at the San Francisco conference or,46
NA,any other similar conference after,46
NA,this war is over or before i t ends.,46
NA,The reason for that is chiefly because,46
NA,no debate has taken place in this Parlia-,46
NA,"ment on the matters to be discussed. So,",46
NA,"as honorable members, we present to our",46
NA,"constituents, and as a nation we present",46
NA,"to the world, the spectacle of sending",46
NA,Ministers abroad without instructions,46
NA,being given to them by the Parliament,46
NA,that they represent. They may have,46
NA,received instructions from the Govern-,46
NA,"ment, but events even during the life-",46
NA,time of the Curtin Government have,46
NA,shown that when it came to a *' show-,46
NA,"down"", something which Ministers",46
NA,wanted to do was not what their sup-,46
NA,porters wanted to do. I do not say that,46
NA,that will happen very often. Sometimes,46
NA,"I wish to the Lord that it would happen,",46
NA,but it does not. But that possibility will,46
NA,be borne in mind by the representatives of,46
NA,other countries who will meet the repre-,46
NA,sentatives of the Commonwealth at San,46
NA,Francisco. A great variety of govern-,46
NA,ment representatives are going to San,46
NA,Francisco.,46
Mr LAZZARINI ,Th e honorable mem-,46
NA,"ber personifies the saying, "" The devil",46
NA,"was sick, the devil a monk would be "".",46
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON , I wish,46
NA,that the Minister for Home Security,46
NA,would not talk in his sleep. At the San,46
NA,"Francisco conference, this Government",46
NA,will be represented by two senior Minis-,46
NA,ters. The Opposition also will send,46
NA,representatives to the conference. Per-,46
NA,"sonally, I am opposed to members of the",46
NA,Opposition in this Parliament attend-,46
NA,ing the conference under the conditions,46
NA,that have been laid down for them.,46
NA,[Extension of time granted.'] I believe,46
NA,in the rather outmoded idea that the,46
NA,Government is in office and should,46
NA,govern. I t should take the responsibility,46
NA,for its administration. The Opposition,46
NA,should not take part in things which it,46
NA,cannot control or influence. The decision,46
NA,as to who should represent the country,46
NA,at such a conference should be,46
NA,made by the Government. The dele-,46
NA,gation should consist of government,46
NA,"nominees, and should give effect to the",46
NA,"policy of the Government, and nobody",46
NA,else. No honorable member who goes from,46
NA,this side of the House will be able to,46
NA,commit a future Parliament. He cannot,46
NA,say what will be done by a majority of,46
NA,members of the Liberal party when we,46
NA,"occupy the treasury bench, as no doubt",46
NA,we shall after the next elections. I n,46
NA,"order to do so, We shall have to double",46
NA,"our numbers, and that will mean an in-",46
NA,fusion of new blood and new ideas.,46
NA,"Therefore, we face a future which",46
NA,perhaps is not easily predictable.,46
NA,I pass now to the other important,46
NA,"matter with which I desire to deal,",46
NA,"namely, the position of the Australian",46
NA,Army. I n view of remarks reported in,46
NA,"the press recently, and attributed to the",46
NA,"Chief of the A ir Staff, I may have some-",46
NA,thing to say later about the Royal Aus-,46
NA,"tralian Air Force, but I shall reserve",46
NA,those comments until the Minister for,46
NA,Air ( Mr Drakeford) makes in this,46
NA,chamber the statement that to-day he,46
NA,promised to prepare. A good deal of,46
NA,confused thinking is evident i n what,46
NA,has been said by Ministers. I have,46
NA,listened to nearly every speaker- I,46
NA,have seldom been out of the chamber-,46
NA,and I could be excused for thinking at,46
NA,one moment that the waging of the,46
NA,present campaign in the South-West,46
NA,Pacific Area is entirely the responsi-,46
NA,"bility of General MACArthur, and a few",46
NA,"minutes later, that the campaign is the",46
NA,sole responsibility of the Government.,46
NA,"Frankly, I do not know what is the set-up",47
NA,for the control of the Australian forces.,47
NA,I was rather interested to note that the,47
NA,honorable member for Warringah ( Mr.,47
NA,Spender) and the Prime Minister ( Mr.,47
NA,Curtin) could not agree upon what had,47
NA,"been, done at recent meetings of the",47
NA,"Advisory War Council. So, i f the great",47
NA,actors behind the scenes are unable to,47
NA,"agree, then honorable members like",47
NA,myself may be permitted to question the,47
NA,whole foundation on which this structure,47
NA,of control or direction of the Avar rests.,47
Mr CONELAN ,Th e honorable member,47
NA,knows why the Prime Minister and the,47
NA,honorable member for Warringah could,47
NA,not agree.,47
Mr FADDEN ,I t was explained that,47
NA,the honorable member for Warringah,47
NA,did not attend those meetings of the,47
NA,Advisory War Council because he was,47
NA,abroad at the time. That appeared to,47
NA,be a reasonable explanation of his stateit,47
NA,ment that he did riot know what had,47
NA,occurred.,47
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON , The,47
NA,point which I have emphasized repeatedly,47
NA,during this war is that wars are waged,47
NA,"by governments, and that campaigns are",47
NA,conducted by commanders. No govern-,47
NA,"ment, in my presence, can shelve its",47
NA,responsibility on to any soldier in uni-,47
NA,form. The responsibility for saying what,47
NA,military campaign shall be conducted is,47
NA,"that of War Cabinet, and of no other",47
NA,authority. The manner in which that,47
NA,campaign shall be executed is the respon-,47
NA,"sibility of the. Army, Navy or Air Force",47
NA,"chief, whom Cabinet selects -to con-",47
NA,duct the operations. On some occasions,47
NA,there is a tendency in this cham-,47
NA,ber to criticize the Government and,47
NA,on others to criticize the Commander-,47
NA,in-Chief for what ought to be solely the,47
NA,responsibility of th© Government. Pre-,47
NA,cisely where the functions of one end,47
NA,"and those of the other begin, or how",47
NA,"they are interwoven, I do not know.",47
NA,The present command has been the,47
NA,subject of a good deal of criticism,47
NA,in more than one place. This criticism,47
NA,arose in public for the first time about,47
NA,twelve months ago. The ideal for which,47
NA,every honorable member would strive,47
NA,willingly is a condition of affairs under,47
NA,"which the Parliament, the Government,",47
NA,"the people, and the Army would have",47
NA,[22],47
NA,complete confidence in the man entrusted,47
NA,with the command of the Army. Hold-,47
NA,"ing those views, I have to say, very",47
NA,"definitely, that I do not believe that the",47
NA,"Parliament, the people, or the Army has",47
NA,that confidence.,47
NA,NA,47
NA,knows the reason why.,47
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,-An d the,47
NA,honorable gentleman knows i t as well,47
NA,as I do!,47
NA,NA,47
NA,""" croakers."" in the Opposition parties",47
NA,who iwere disappointed with their pro-,47
NA,gress in the Army.,47
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,Tha t is,47
NA,not so.,47
Mr CONELAN ,Th e honorable mem-,47
NA,ber himself got out of uniform.,47
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON , I said,47
NA,that the Army could discharge me before,47
NA,did so. I had many matters to which,47
NA,I could give attention.,47
NA,NA,47
NA,refer to the honorable memiber.,47
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,N o man,47
NA,who has seen the service that I have,47
NA,"-no t overseas in this Avar, but in",47
NA,the Commonwealth of Australia-an d,47
NA,rubbed shoulders Avith members of the,47
NA,"forces, could truthfully tell the Parlia-",47
NA,ment that all is Avell Avith the Army.,47
Mr BRYSON ,Th e Army is doing,47
NA,fairly well since the honorable member,47
NA,left it.,47
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON , The,47
NA,Army might do very much worse i f the,47
NA,honorable member joined it. Public,47
NA,"criticism, which comes from officers hold-",47
NA,ing a rank as high as that of Lieutenant-,47
NA,"General, has not been answered.",47
NA,NA,47
NA,General?,47
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON , I do not,47
NA,desire to mention names.,47
NA,NA,47
NA,"public, why not give the names?",47
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON , The,47
NA,honorable member knows them as well,47
NA,as I do. He is about the least innocent,47
NA,member in this House. Criticism has,47
NA,"been offered of campaigns, and of cer-",47
NA,"tain demotions and transfers-no t one,",47
NA,but many-an d they have never been,47
NA,"satisfactorily answered. I n my opinion,",47
NA,there should l e a much closer connexion,47
NA,botween the Parliament of the Common-,48
NA,wealth and the Australian armed forces,48
NA,than there has been during this war.,48
NA,The attitude adopted by this Parlia-,48
NA,ment is in striking contrast to that,48
NA,adopted by other Parliaments in the,48
NA,British Empire and the Congress of,48
NA,the United States of America.,48
NA,NA,48
NA,member requires is political control of,48
NA,"the Army, but not political control of",48
NA,banking institutions.,48
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,Perhap s,48
NA,the honorable memiber for Ballarat would,48
NA,"prefer it the other way, and we cannot",48
NA,reach a compromise on these questions.,48
NA,The 'Congress of the United States of,48
NA,"America has taken up this matter, and",48
NA,some of its members have visited nearly,48
NA,every theatre in which major American,48
NA,"forces have been engaged. But, with one",48
NA,"or two exceptions, the Parliament of the",48
NA,Commonwealth has not been represented,48
NA,in. any major theatres in. which Aus-,48
NA,tralian forces have been engaged. No,48
NA,comimittee of this Parliament has ever,48
NA,entered the fighting zones.,48
Mr WILSON ,Member s of Parliament,48
NA,have been rigorously excluded from the,48
NA,fighting zones.,48
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,Tha t is,48
NA,correct. The policy of the present com-,48
NA,mand of the Australian Anmy is to,48
NA,exclude members of Parliament from,48
NA,the forward areas. I have no doubt,48
NA,about that.,48
NA,NA,48
NA,ment would only be a nuisance in the,48
NA,forward areas.,48
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON , Even,48
NA,"nuisankses have to be tolerated, the best",48
NA,example of that being the honorable,48
NA,member for Ballarat. Twelve months,48
NA,"ago, the role of the Australian Army",48
NA,was criticized in this chamiber. Many,48
NA,honorable members believed that Aus-,48
NA,tralian Imlperial Force divisions were,48
NA,being repeatedly throwninto tropical,48
NA,"campaigns, whilst militia forces were",48
NA,"being fully employed. At that time,",48
NA,there was a vital necessity to clear cerno poison in it.,48
NA,tain important areas in the South-West,48
NA,Pacific Area. That vital necessity no,48
NA,"longer exists. Therefore, I believe that",48
NA,"the proper role, of the Australian Im-",48
NA,perial Force is to be engaged in one of,48
NA,"the main theatres of war, because with",48
NA,great respect to ourselves and the part,48
NA,that we are playing in the South-West,48
NA,"Pacific Area, that role is having no",48
NA,important or material bearing on the,48
NA,ultimate outcome of the conflict between,48
NA,the Allied forces and Japan. That conflict,48
NA,will be decided elsewhere. My firm,48
NA,"belief is that the "" p i c k "" of the fight-",48
NA,"ing forces, and as many of them as",48
NA,"we can equip, supply, and control, should",48
NA,"be used' in a main theatre of war,",48
NA,"wherever that may happen to be, for",48
NA,the elimination of the armed forces of,48
NA,"the enemy. After the major decision,",48
NA,we can turn to what must be regarded,48
NA,by any man who looks at the facts fairly,48
NA,"and squarely, as a theatre of war. of only",48
NA,"secondary importance. Those Japanese,",48
NA,"whom our troops are at present fighting,",48
NA,are not able to evacuate those islands.,48
NA,They cannot move large numbers of men,48
NA,or supply them adequately. They cannot,48
NA,threaten the security of the Common-,48
NA,"wealth of Australia,' or jeopardize any",48
NA,effort that we like to make in the South-,48
NA,"West Pacific Area, in the Philippines,",48
NA,"or in Asia. Therefore, the present role",48
NA,allotted to large numbers of our troops,48
NA,is not directed to a speedy termination,48
NA,of the war with Japan. I f they are not,48
NA,being directed to securing that im-,48
NA,portant final decision which is .necessary,48
NA,in order to allow us to tackle the,48
NA,""" sideshows """,48
Mr WARD ,Doe s the honorable mem-,48
NA,ber consider himself to be an authority,48
NA,on military strategy?,48
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON , I am,48
NA,"not an authority on "" the Brisbane line "".",48
Mr WARD , I recall that the honor-,48
NA,able member said that when Germany,48
NA,attacked the Soviet the Russian armies,48
NA,would last for about six weeks.,48
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,I f the,48
NA,Minister for Transport ( Mr Ward) can,48
NA,find that expression in any public state-,48
NA,"not ment that I made, I shall give him ai",48
NA,"dinner, and guarantee that there will be'",48
Mr WARD ,Th e honorable member,48
NA,made that statement in this chamiber.,48
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,Neve r,48
NA,at any time have I made that statement.,48
NA,"In time of peace, I tried to warn this-",48
NA,House of the dangers confronting us.,48
NA,I told the story as I believed i t would,49
NA,"develop, but I never at any time sug-",49
NA,gested that what I said was gospel or,49
NA,-oracle. I am not one of those who were,49
NA,"born in Delphi, and I am not one of",49
NA,those who ought to be sent to Canossa.,49
NA,Some of my friends opposite ought to,49
NA,go there every day of their lives.,49
NA,"In my opinion, all is not well inside",49
NA,the Australian armed forces. I refer,49
NA,particularly to the Army. One of the,49
NA,pointers to that is the very high degree,49
NA,-of absences without leave which have,49
NA,existed for some time. I t is useless to,49
NA,try to conceal these matters. One of,49
NA,"the things which annoys me, and I think",49
NA,that it is not fair to the forces con-,49
NA,"-cerned, is the everlasting publication in",49
NA,the newspapers of trials by court-martial.,49
NA,"These are trials for military offences only,",49
NA,and in most cases have no bearing on a,49
NA,"man's civil record. At one period, the Min-",49
NA,ister for the Army ( Mr Forde) promised,49
NA,me in writing that the publication of,49
NA,"-courts-martial proceedings would cease,",49
NA,but that is one of the promises which has,49
NA,not been honoured. We cannot have a,49
NA,big force of men under military control,49
NA,with no effective occupation in front of,49
NA,them and at the same time preserve a,49
NA,high degree of discipline. I t is utterly,49
NA,impossible. There is no place to which,49
NA,"the old adage, "" Satan finds some mis-",49
NA,"chief still for idle hands to do "" applies",49
NA,more truly than in the Army. These men,49
NA,are well trained; they are in the pink of,49
NA,condition; but they have no military,49
NA,occupation in front of them. There is,49
NA,.a tendency amongst many soldiers who,49
NA,in normal circumstances would not,49
NA,"break loose to have a "" fling"", with",49
NA,-the result that penalties pile > up.,49
NA,Much more could be said about the,49
NA,-condition of the Australian Army and,49
NA,"will be said in the not distant future,",49
NA,unless certain very important changes are,49
NA,made. Before long servicemen will return,49
NA,"from overseas, and when the censorship",49
NA,"which is imposed to-day is lifted, per-",49
NA,mitting the publication of views held by,49
NA,"senior officers, justice will again be",49

NA,"who may be hurt in the process, "" the",49
NA,"crooked shall be made straight, and the",49
NA,"rough places plain"", and many things",49
NA,-will appear somewhat different from,49

Mr LANGTRY ,Riverina) [9.2] - I,49
NA,join with other honorable members in,49
NA,extending to their Royal Highnesses a,49
NA,"welcome to this country, and in expressing",49
NA,the hope that their stay with us will be,49
NA,a happy one.,49
NA,The legislative programme outlined in,49
NA,the Speech of His Royal Highness the,49
NA,Governor-General is the most momentous,49
NA,in the history of this Parliament. The,49
NA,Speech forecast many reforms which are,49
NA,long overdue. The most important legis-,49
NA,lation which i t foreshadows is that,49
NA,"relating to finance, housing, and the",49
NA,nationalization of interstate airways,49
NA,which in future will be our most impor-,49
NA,tant mode of transport. I am very,49
NA,pleased to know that this Government,49
NA,proposes to introduce such legislation.,49
NA,I am vitally interested i n the,49
NA,"future of tlie wheat industry, but,",49
NA,"unfortunately, i t has been the foot-",49
NA,ball of party politics for as long as I,49
NA,can remember. I compliment the honor-,49
NA,able member for Forrest ( Mr Lemmon),49
NA,upon his very able speech to-day. The,49
NA,honorable member gave a clear explana-,49
NA,tion in contradiction of certain statements,49
NA,that have been made by some honorable,49
NA,"members opposite, even in my own elec-",49
NA,torate. I refer particularly to the com-,49
NA,parison of the treatment of wheat-growers,49
NA,in Argentina and in this country. The,49
NA,honorable member for Forrest made it,49
NA,quite plain that the Australian wheat-,49
NA,growers are on a better footing than their,49
NA,colleagues in Argentina. Recently the,49
NA,honorable member for Indi ( Mr.,49
NA,MCEwen) visited southern New South,49
NA,Wales and tried to whip up enthusiasm,49
NA,among wheat-growers in his campaign,49
NA,against the Government.,49
NA,The only reason why he came into,49
NA,my electorate was because he had been,49
NA,"discredited hy wheat-growers in Victoria,",49
NA,and together with his Country party,49
NA,"friend, the Premier of Victoria, Mr.",49
NA,"Dunstan, had been fii-mly asked to cease",49
NA,assuming the role of spokesman for the,49
NA,on the wheat industry. Both Mr Dunstan and,49
NA,the honorable member for Indi have,49
NA,"been repudiated by the wheat-growers,",49
NA,and have been told that those en-,49
NA,gaged in the industry object to their,49
NA,efforts to make it a political foot-,49
NA,ball to be kicked about by the members,49
NA,of the Australian Country party to,49
NA,"their great delight, hut to the utter",50
NA,"dismay of wheat-growers, and regardless",50
NA,of the effect upon them. The,50
NA,able member for Indi has no real interest said-,50
NA,in the welfare of wheat-growers.,50
NA,merely endeavouring to make,50
NA,capital at their expense. Let me prove,50
NA,that by referring to the honorable mempoliticians.,50
NA,ber's record: In 1940 he was asked by the,50
NA,Australian Wheatgrowers Federation,50
NA,sign a pledge to support au. increase of,50
NA,the price of wheat at a time,50
NA,advances were at the rate of 2s. 6d.,50
NA,a bushel. He refused. Recently,50
NA,"made reference to that incident,",50
NA,quoting his own words from a report,50
NA,which appeared in the,50
NA,"Advertiser, said: "" I remember",50
NA,election I was sent a document by the,50
NA,"wheat-growers. I did not sign it, and I said-",50
NA,will not sign it at the next,50
NA,That demonstrates clearly his interest,50
NA,the wheat-growers' cause. It should be,50
NA,remembered that this industry has underand,50
NA,gone a terrific transformation,50
NA,"past few years. To prove that, I need in",50
NA,only refer to prices guaranteed by the,50
NA,Commonwealth Government.,50
NA,current harvest the guarantees,50
NA,"4s. 1-J-d. for the first 3,000 bushels, and Minister",50
NA,"3s. as a first advance, for the remainder,",50
NA,both at country sidings. For the forthto,50
NA,"coming harvest, the guaranteed",50
NA,advance will be 4s. 3d. a bushel at,50
NA,"try sidings, which is equivalent",50
NA,home-consumption price of 5s. 2d. at,50
NA,terminals. That is practically,50
NA,the price paid by the Government,50
NA,which the honorable member for Indi,50
NA,was a Minister. He may ignore,50
NA,"fact, but the wheat-growers remember it. to wheat merchants",50
NA,I wish to stress that point particularly.,50
NA,When the war broke out the United,50
NA,Australia party occupied the,50
NA,bench. Wheat in the No. 1 pool Lillie further.,50
NA,realized only 2s. Id. a bushel to the Aus-,50
NA,"tralian growers. Now, this",50
NA,is paying 4s. 3d. a bushel as a,50
NA,"advance; when the wheat is sold, it may",50
NA,bring the full realization price,50
NA,"may be 5s., 6s. or 7s. a bushel.",50
NA,Curtin Administration,50
NA,wonderful job in the circumstances.,50
NA,wheat-growers have decided views on,50
NA,what the honorable member for Indi has wheat,50
NA,been doing in his campaign against the,50
NA,Commonwealth Government.,50
NA,Mr Langtry.,50
NA,the president of the Australian Wheat,50
NA,"Growers Federation, Mr T. W. Lillie,",50
NA,honormade a statement on that campaign. H e,50
NA,He is I believe it is fitting that I should place,50
NA,political before wheat-growers some of the facts relevant,50
NA,to the political controversy which is being,50
NA,shaped around the industry by certain,50
Mr RANKIN , I rise to order. Is the,50
NA,honorable member f or Riverina i n order,50
NA,when i n reading his speech?,50
Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. J. S. Rosevear).,50
NA,he - I understand that the honorable mem-,50
NA,"and, ber f or Riverina ( Mr Langtry) is quot-",50
NA,ing a statement made by the president of,50
NA,Shepparton the Australian Wheat Growers Federa-,50
NA,at an tion. He is quite i n order i n so doing.,50
NA,Mr LAN < x TRY - Mr Lillie further,50
NA,"election"". Firstly, I desire to express resentment at a",50
NA,"in recent statement by Mr MCEwen, M.H.E. He",50
NA,"said, "" Mr Scully appears to have a most",50
NA,fertile imagination in working out cheap ways,50
NA,means to buy off wheat-growers and,50
NA,in the quieten the demand that they should be paid,50
NA,full what they are entitled to. I can only,50
NA,read into that statement that the wheat-,50
NA,growers' leaders have been the recipients of,50
NA,For the political bribes from a Minister who has,50
NA,were prostituted his office. I t is a dastardly utter-,50
NA,ance which reflects no credit on a former,50
NA,of the Crown. Wheat-growers' leaders,50
NA,in all States conscientiously apply themselves,50
NA,the task of improving the economic 'position,50
NA,first of growers. All have given long and honor-,50
NA,"able service to the industry, and they resent",50
NA,counbitterly such an unjust accusation.,50
NA,to a,50
NA,The campaign which is being pursued,50
NA,double by the honorable member f or I n d i has,50
NA,in no sound basis. H i s object is to under-,50
NA,"mine the stability of"" the industry. I n",50
NA,"that other words, be is endeavouring to restore",50
NA,their pre-war,50
NA,domination of the industry. The same,50
NA,may be said of the efforts of the Premier,50
NA,"treasury of Victoria. I should, like to quote Mr .",50
Mr RANKIN , A g a i q . I rise to order.,50
NA,Government Is the honorable member for Riverina,50
NA,first entitled to read his speech?,50
NA,"Mr SPEAKER,- I have already",50
NA,which ruled that the honorable member f o r,50
NA,The Riverina is i n order i n quoting the,50
NA,has done a remarks of Mr Lillie.,50
Mr LANGTRY , Mr L i l l i e said-,50
NA,Mr MCEwen now desires to relate price for,50
NA,for stock feed to the present high,50
NA,export values. This is in distinct contrast to,50
NA,"his attitude as a Minister. When a Minister,",50
NA,"Recently, he said Australia could not afford to guarantee",50
NA,"more than 3s. lOd. a bushel, f.o.b., which on",51
NA,the basis of guaranteed production is equal,51
NA,to approximately 8s. a bushel at sidings. War,51
NA,"expenditure, he said, of £70,000,000 would not",51
NA,permit i t . War expenditure to-day is over,51
NA,"£400,000,000 a year. Then, he voted to pay",51
NA,"half of any return over 3s. lOd. a bushel, f.o.b.,",51
NA,"for export wheat into an equalization fund, the",51
NA,growers to get tlie balance. Now he advocates,51
NA,an open purse.,51
NA,The honorable member for Indi has said,51
NA,both inside and outside this chamber that,51
NA,"there has been a £10,000,000 ""steal""",51
NA,from the Australian wheat-growers. .That,51
NA,statement definitely is not in accord with,51
NA,facts. The truth is that wheat-growers,51
NA,will not be robbed of one penny. The,51
NA,honorable member for Forrest has just,51
NA,explained to the House that when the,51
NA,"pool is finalized for all wheat sold, for",51
NA,"export and home consumption, the farmer",51
NA,will receive the average price for all wheat,51
NA,"sold. I n my own electorate 80 per cent,",51
NA,of the growers who forwarded wheat to,51
NA,"the pool and were paid 4s. a bushel for it,",51
NA,have bought at least some of it hack at,51
NA,3s. 6d. a bushel. The Government is pre-,51
NA,pared to provide the balance whether,51
NA,"it is 6d., Sd., or 2s. a bushel. There-",51
NA,"fore, the statements that have been",51
NA,made by honorable members opposite are,51
NA,far from the facts. I have no objection,51
NA,to members of the Opposition visiting my,51
NA,"electorate, but when they do, I expect",51
NA,them to tell the truth. The honorable,51
NA,member for Indi should be an acrobat,51
NA,instead of a politician. He is adept at,51
NA,"turning somersaults, sidestepping and",51
NA,"dodging facts, activities which hurt him.",51
NA,The same may be said of almost every,51
NA,member of the Australian Country party.,51
NA,I have no argument with members of the,51
NA,Liberal party except that they stand for,51
NA,vested interests. I t is ridiculous for,51
NA,members of the Australian Country party,51
NA,to say that the wheat-growers ofAus-,51
NA,tralia are not getting a fair deal. Appar-,51
NA,ently the honorable member for Indi has,51
NA,told that story so often that he is begin-,51
NA,ning to believe it himself. I am reminded,51
NA,of a man. who came to me when I was,51
NA,"carting wool near the River Murray, and",51
NA,"said that he was hungry. I said, "" Are",51
NA,"you ? "" He replied, "" Yes, i f I had some",51
NA,fat I would f r y some fish i f I had some,51
NA,"fish to fry "". A similar argument is used",51
NA,by the honorable member for Indi. What,51
NA,was the position when this Government,51
NA,assumed ofiice and the honorable member,51
NA,for Gwydir ( Mr Scully) became Minis-,51
NA,ter for Commerce? The problem then,51
NA,was over-production. Huge stocks of,51
NA,"wheat were held in all States, and",51
NA,methods had to be devised to dispose,51
NA,of the surplus. These included the pro-,51
NA,duction of power alcohol. Some wheat,51
NA,stored in Western Australia was found,51
NA,to bo weevil-infested. The position to-day,51
NA,after three bad seasons-on e of them the,51
NA,worst in history-i s vastly different,51
NA,owing to a severe drought. Evens-,51
NA,"the Albury, Wagga, Temora and Cowra",51
NA,districts which were never expected to-,51
NA,"fail in times of most severe drought, are-",51
NA,suffering badly. They have never pre--,51
NA,"viously failed in my experience, which",51
NA,"includes the droughts of 1902, 1914 and",51
NA,1919. They were always able to pro-,51
NA,"duce some fodder, but to-day, when we",51
NA,are faced with the responsibility of feed-,51
NA,"ing more people than ever before, crops",51
NA,are practically valueless. The Minister,51
NA,for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr.,51
NA,Scully) has considered all aspects of the,51
NA,situation and has released some wheat in,51
NA,order to keep sheep and cattle alive. Men,51
NA,who are receiving wheat for starving,51
NA,stock are getting their own wheat back,51
NA,"at a reduced rate, whilst good purchase",51
NA,prices are being paid for i t by the Go-,51
NA,vernment. The Commonwealth has,51
NA,"already paid about £2,000,000 for the",51
NA,wheat used for starving stock and a,51
NA,"further payment of about £6,000,000 will",51
NA,"be available soon. I n spite of this, the",51
NA,honorable member for Indi ( Mr.,51
NA,MCEwen) said that the wheat-growers are,51
NA,not getting a fair deal and are being,51
NA,robbed of millions of pounds. I f the hon-,51
NA,"orable gentleman had said, "" Vote for the",51
NA,Labour party at the next elections; it is,51
NA,"your friend, we are your enenjies"", he",51
NA,would have told the truth. I have stated,51
NA,tho facts of the case. I attended a meet-,51
NA,ing of farmers convened by the Farmers,51
NA,and Settlers Association to which he,51
NA,referred. The Minister for Com-,51
NA,merce and Agriculture was invited,51
NA,"to attend, but he could not do so,",51
NA,and the honorable member for Ballarat,51
NA,NA,51
NA,was allowed ten minutes in which to,51
NA,"speak, but, when I tried to explain the",51
NA,true position the chairman made me sit,51
NA,down. He had been an Australian Coun-,52
NA,try party candidate at the previous elec-,52
NA,tions. The gun was loaded and the Go-,52
NA,x'ernment case was lost before we arrived,52
NA,at the meeting. The meeting was not,52
NA,representative of actual wheat-growers.,52
NA,-It was organized by the Farmers,52
NA,"and Settlers Association which,",52
NA,"everybody knows, has been f o r the",52
NA,last twenty years the mouthpiece of,52
NA,the Australian Country party. I myself,52
NA,resigned f r o m membership of the associa-,52
NA,tion over twenty years ago because of its,52
NA,political tendencies. The honorable mem-,52
NA,ber f or Ballarat was also prevented f r o m,52
NA,stating the truth at the meeting because,52
NA,he tried to explain the position i n his,52
NA,own way. I compliment the Minister,52
NA,for Commerce and Agriculture upon what,52
NA,he has done f or the wheat industry. Erom,52
NA,the time when the Labour party assumed,52
NA,"office, the contrast between what i t has",52
NA,done f o r the primary producers and what,52
NA,its predecessors did f or them has been,52
NA,very marked. Whether the man on the,52
NA,"land grows wheat, wool, f a t lambs or",52
NA,"vegetables, he receives good guaranteed",52
NA,"prices, which previous governments did",52
NA,not provide f or him. I am sorry that,52
NA,the referendum proposals were rejected,52
NA,"by the people, because as the law stands",52
NA,"at present, prices f or primary produce",52
NA,can be guaranteed f o r only six months,52
NA,"after the end of the war. However, that",52
NA,is not the fault of this Government. I,52
NA,have always advocated guaranteed prices,52
NA,for all primary products and u n t il,52
NA,"guaranteed prices are paid, the primary",52
NA,producer w i l l not have a f a i r chance of,52
NA,survival. He w i l l be forced to put his,52
NA,products on the market when they are,52
NA,ready and he w i l l be at the mercy of,52
NA,"the exploiters, who are numerous.",52
NA,shall now quote some extracts from a,52
NA,publication on primary production which,52
NA,should be of interest to the honorable,52
NA,member f or Bendigo ( Mr R a n k i n ) -,52
NA,The Country party was associated with,52
NA,the then United Australia party for many,52
NA,years but they were more concerned about,52
NA,securing ministerial office than about fighting,52
NA,for the interests they were supposed to repre-,52
NA,"sent. Mr Wilson, Independent Country party",52
NA,member in 1940 said that had members of the,52
NA,Federal Country party displayed the same,52
NA,vigour and aggressiveness on behalf of the,52
NA,wheat-growers that they displayed in achieving,52
NA,"their personal ambitions, the farmers would",52
NA,be in a better position.,52
NA,Mr Langtry.,52
NA,The Wheatgrower of Western Australia con-,52
NA,"tained an article in which i t said, "" What",52
NA,traitors these Federal Country party repre-,52
NA,sentatives have proved themselves to the people,52
NA,"they claim to represent."" The article went on",52
NA,"to say, "" The numerous representatives to the",52
NA,United Australia party-Country party Federal,52
NA,Government proved the futility of making,52
NA,representatives to a party whose aims and,52
NA,as objects were and are completely at variance,52
NA,"with the aims of primary producers "".",52
NA,This is a further extract from the same,52
NA,publication-,52
NA,It is estimated that as a result of assured,52
NA,"markets and payable prices, returns to primary",52
NA,"producers are now about £40,000,000 a year",52
NA,"higher than before the war. At tlie same time,",52
NA,bank indebtedness of primary producers lias,52
NA,"been reduced by about £00,000,000 compared",52
NA,with pre-war figures.,52
NA,Honorable members opposite overlook,52
NA,many of the things that this Govern-,52
NA,ment has done. I t has subsidized the,52
NA,producers of necessary primary commo-,52
NA,"dities. There are many of these, but",52
NA,they have not been mentioned by honor-,52
NA,able gentlemen opposite. Here are some,52
NA,of the things that this Government is,52
NA,doing-,52
NA,"Wheat-growers, with other producers, receive",52
NA,the benefit of a Commonwealth subsidy on,52
NA,"superphosphate. In December, 1941, assent",52
NA,was given to a bill introduced by the present,52
NA,Minister for Commerce and Agriculture pro-,52
NA,"viding for the appropriation of £850,000 to",52
NA,provide a subsidy on superphosphate of £1 5s.,52
NA,"a ton. In March, 1943, the Primary Producers'",52
NA,Relief ((Superphosphate) Act was passed. This,52
NA,"appropriated the sum of £900,000 to enable the",52
NA,price to be pegged on the basis of £5 Is. a ton,52
NA,"for 18 per cent, superphosphate. Last year",52
NA,"the cost of the subsidy rose to £1,300,000",52
NA,and the estimate for the present year is,52
NA,"£2,750,000. The Government believes that it",52
NA,is of the utmost importance to assist growers,52
NA,to keep down the costs of production.,52
NA,Action has also been taken to peg the price,52
NA,"of cornsacks at 13s. 4Jd. a dozen, f.o.r. capital",52
NA,I cities. . The subsidy on cornsacks is costing,52
NA,"the Commonwealth £1,000,000 a year, or",52
NA,approximately 5s. a dozen.,52
NA,The Government will pay all transport costs,52
NA,for wheat shipped interstate during the,52
NA,drought. The transport of wheat interstate,52
NA,"may cost about £2,000,000.",52
NA,That is the true story.,52
NA,The honorable member f o r Kennedy,52
NA,"( Mr Riordan) made a fine, well-con-",52
NA,sidered speech on the subject of water con-,52
NA,"servation, and I compliment him upon his",52
NA,effort. There is no more important pro-,52
NA,blem facing this Parliament than that of,52
NA,"water conservation, because i t involves",52
NA,the prevention of soil erosion. We have,52
NA,ample evidence of what this nation has,53
NA,suffered for many years as the result,53
NA,of water shortages. We should concen-,53
NA,trate on persuading State governments to,53
NA,make good use of money which should be,53
NA,provided by the Commonwealth for the,53
NA,purpose of water conservation. A great,53
NA,deal of interstate jealousy has occurred,53
NA,over the proposed diversion of the Snowy,53
NA,River waters. I n New South Wales,53
NA,millions of cubic feet of water run away,53
NA,to the sea every week. Settlers in the,53
NA,Riverina and western New South Wales,53
NA,have been agitating for a long time to,53
NA,Iiave the Snowy River waters diverted to,53
NA,"the Murrumbidgee, and the New South",53
NA,Wales Government appointed a com-,53
NA,mittee to investigate the matter. I t,53
NA,recommended the diversion of that water,53
NA,tor the purpose of irrigation. Since the,53
NA,"committee made its report, a deputation",53
NA,has waited on the Premier of Victoria,53
NA,requesting that the water be used in a,53
NA,hydro-electric scheme for Victoria. I t,53
NA,is difficult to say where that water will,53
NA,be used. I f we cannot get water in the,53
NA,Riverina area from the Snowy River,53
NA,landowners iu the dry areas will be,53
NA,severely handicapped. Only a few days,53
NA,ago we read in the newspapers that the,53
NA,Hume Weir had only 27 days' supply of,53
NA,water left. The Murray Valley covers a,53
NA,vast area and there should be sufficient,53
NA,"water in the weir to last, another two",53
NA,"years, not 27 days. When the plans and",53
NA,specifications for the Hume Weir were,53
NA,"first prepared, they provided for the",53
NA,"removal of Tallangatta, a town of about",53
NA,"800 inhabitants, which would have cost",53
NA,"the Government about £500,000 in com-",53
NA,"pensation. However, that was not done",53
NA,and the weir now can hold about half,53
NA,of the quantity of water that could have,53
NA,been stored. That fact should be con-,53
NA,sidered seriously with a view to increas-,53
NA,ing the storage capacity of the reservoir.,53
NA,"Unfortunately, the Commonwealth has",53
NA,no control over this matter owing to,53
NA,"the defeat of the referendum proposals,",53
NA,but every member of Parliament through-,53
NA,out Australia should interest himself in,53
NA,tbis vital problem of water conservation.,53
NA,Since 1902 the people have lost millions,53
NA,of pounds as the result of droughts. For,53
NA,"instance, the rice-planting programme",53
NA,was restricted last year because there,53
NA,not sufficient water in the Burrinjuck,53
NA,dam. With present machinery and,53
NA,"engineering methods, we could make",53
NA,many dams to retain the water that,53
NA,"falls in the wet seasons, and we should",53
NA,never be short of water. Unless we have,53
NA,"extensive irrigation schemes, Australia",53
NA,will be in a bad way for the next genera-,53
NA,tion. Erosion is increasing and our,53
NA,annual rainfall is decreasing in every,53
NA,State. With water we could use scien-,53
NA,"tific methods to bind the soil, encourage",53
NA,"the growth of herbage, and thus prevent",53
NA,further erosion. I hope that honorable,53
NA,members will take serious note of what,53
NA,tlie honorable member for Kennedy said,53
NA,on this matter.,53
NA,The subject of housing has been sadly,53
NA,neglected. That is not the fault of this,53
NA,"Government, because our man-power",53
NA,resources have been used to the,53
NA,utmost in defending the nation. I,53
NA,compliment the Prime Minister on his,53
NA,firm attitude in prosecuting Australia's,53
NA,war effort. Had it not been for his,53
NA,foresight and his consistent advocacy,53
NA,of a policy of 'obtaining assistance,53
NA,from another country we might not,53
NA,be able to meet in this Parliament to-day.,53
NA,Primary producers have complained,53
NA,about petrol and motor vehicle tyre short-,53
NA,"ages, but this Government has done a good",53
NA,job in the interests of everybody. I support,53
NA,the honorable member for Wide Bay ( Mr.,53
NA,"Corser), who said that at the first oppor-",53
NA,tunity the Government should make more,53
NA,petrol and tyres available to primary,53
NA,producers. The primary producers have,53
NA,been handicapped by force of circum-,53
NA,stances over which the Government had,53
NA,"no control, but now that the immediate",53
NA,"danger to the country has passed, and",53
NA,with the improvement in the petrol and,53
NA,"rubber supply position, the Government",53
NA,"should, at the first opportunity, increase",53
NA,the ration to primary producers. Ration-,53
NA,ing of these commodities has been carried,53
NA,out on an unsatisfactory basis. I know,53
NA,of cases in my own electorate in which,53
NA,men living within 2 or 3 miles of,53
NA,a town have been receiving the same,53
NA,ration as men living 15 or 20 miles out.,53
NA,When one is 15 or 20 miles from a,53
NA,"town, it is difficult to get a doctor in case",53
NA,of illness. The whole of the people of the,53
NA,Commonwealth have risen magnificently,53
NA,to the occasion. But there is a limit to,53
NA,was human endurance. Primary producers,53
NA,have done their best to meet the.force,53
NA,"of circumstances, but tbey cannot con-",54
NA,"tinue much longer, and our food prob-",54
NA,lems are likely to become greater. I,54
NA,-was pleased to bear tbe Prime Minister,54
NA,promise a review of the man-power posi-,54
NA,tion by next June. The primary indus-,54
NA,tries are entitled to first consideration,54
NA,"i n regard to man-power, because our fight-",54
NA,ing men must be fed. [Extension of time,54
NA,granted.] I hope that the Government,54
NA,will consider the representations that I,54
NA,"have made in regard to man-power, petrol",54
NA,"and tyres. I realize, of; course, that it",54
NA,is faced with the problem of meeting,54
NA,"many needs with few men, and that",54
NA,nobody can be expected to do what is,54
NA,impossible. We are lucky to be living,54
NA,still in a free country.,54

Mr MOUNTJOY ,Swan) [9.34] -I,54
NA,"the last five years, the major attention",54
NA,of the nation has been f ocused upon the,54
NA,winning of the present terrible war.,54
NA,"With_ our allies, we can now state with",54
NA,certainty that the war cannot be lost to,54
NA,"us. The propaganda , machine of the",54
NA,German Reich is feverishly seeking some,54
NA,means whereby it can split the unity of,54
NA,the Allied Nations and thereby cause,54
NA,them to lose the peace. Whilst I am pre-,54
NA,pared to agree that those who make a,54
NA,particular study of foreign affairs are,54
NA,"inclined, to look beyond the immediate",54
NA,"problems at home, I , nevertheless, con-",54
NA,sider that this House could devote more,54
NA,attention to our relationships with other,54
NA,countries. Some criticism has been,54
NA,directed at the Government for not hav-,54
NA,ing provided more opportunity for the,54
NA,House to debate international politics. I,54
NA,regard this criticism as most unfair. The,54
NA,of Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt),54
NA,has made many excellent statements on,54
NA,"which this subject could have been, de-",54
NA,bated had not the members of the Opposi-,54
NA,tion deliberately wasted the time of the,54
NA,House on numerous occasions. Under the,54
NA,"policy of the present Government, Aus-",54
NA,tralia's diplomatic status has made a,54
NA,greater advance in the last three and a,54
NA,half years than it made under all previous,54
NA,"more governments combined, and now this",54
NA,nation is able to speak with the authority,54
NA,too and independence to which the feats of,54
NA,arms of our gallant soldiers entitle us.,54
NA,Australia is a Pacific power. The Go-,54
NA,vernment has established direct diplo-,54
NA,"matic relationships with China, the",54
NA,United States of America and the Union,54
NA,"of Soviet Socialist Republics-which , to-",54
NA,gether with the other members of the,54
NA,"British Commonwealth of Nations, con-",54
NA,I love stitute the great powers.,54
NA,Mention has been made in this debate,54
NA,sea. of what-is known as the Polish problem.,54
NA,"to the This is the "" pebble"" on which Herr",54
NA,Goebbels hopes to split the unity of the,54
NA,Allied Nations. The Reich's propaganda,54
NA,"chief,' of course, has friends i n all coun-",54
NA,by tries. The week-end newspapers of the,54
NA,5th March gave the names and records,54
NA,fed of a few of Germany's friends in Great,54
NA,and one does not have to seek far,54
NA,to find the Australian counterparts of,54
NA,a those gentlemen. Many honest-thinking,54
NA,citizens of this country consider that,54
NA,n Poland is getting a raw deal. I am sure,54
NA,that if they knew a little of the history,54
NA,"of the matter, they would not be carried",54
NA,away by this pro-Axis propaganda. David,54
NA,"Lloyd George, a Liberal, but distinct f<rom",55
NA,"our Australian Liberals, in a foreword to",55
NA,Coates's The History of Anglo-Soviet,55
NA,"Relations, said this-",55
NA,"When oil that memorable day, 11th June,",55
NA,".1942, the Foreign Secretary, Mr Eden,",55
NA,announced in the House of Commons the con-,55
NA,clusion of a treaty of alliance with the Uuion,55
NA,"of Soviet Socialist Republics, I immediately",55
NA,"commented: "" As one who has laboured for",55
NA,over twenty years to establish a good under-,55
NA,standing between Soviet Russia and this coun-,55
NA,"try, I felicitate the Prime Minister and the",55
NA,Foreign Secretary and the Government upon,55
NA,the accomplishment of this treaty. Had i t,55
NA,been a fact some years ago many grave,55
NA,blunders in foreign policy would have been,55
NA,"avoided. Not only that, this war could never",55
NA,"have occurred "". There was no exaggeration m",55
NA,these words; I meant every one of them. 1,55
NA,might have added that the Covenant of the,55
NA,League would have become an established and,55
NA,irresistible factor in the affairs of nations;,55
NA,the era of disarmament would have begun in,55
NA,"earnest, and the age of "" peace on earth and",55
NA,"goodwill amongst men "" would have been well",55
NA,on the way.,55
NA,Let us trace the history of this matter.,55
NA,After the Russian revolution of Novem-,55
NA,"ber, 1917, the newly formed Soviet State",55
NA,was attacked by fourteen different powers.,55
NA,Already weakened by the war with Ger-,55
NA,"many, it was thus further seriously",55
NA,weakened. During the progress of this war,55
NA,"of intervention, the war of 1914-18 ended",55
NA,"and a new Polish State was established,",55
NA,the eastern frontier being agreed upon,55
NA,by the Allied Supreme Council in 1919.,55
NA,This frontier has since been known as,55
NA,the Ourzon Line; it was named after the,55
NA,"then British Foreign Secretary, Lord",55
NA,"* Ourzon, a hard-bitten tory and a",55
NA,bitter enemy of the young Soviet,55
NA,State. The Allied Supreme Council,55
NA,agreed that the country east of this,55
NA,"line was etbnologically, geographically",55
NA,and historically a part of the Ukraine,55
NA,"and Byelo-Russia. On the 16th April,",55
NA,"1919, Poland launched a wanton and",55
NA,an unprovoked attack on the weakened,55
NA,"Soviet State, and by force of arms",55
NA,annexed western Byelo-Russia,55
NA,"western Ukraine. From 1922 to 1925,",55
NA,the Polish Constitution gave the hope,55
NA,that Poland would become a democratic,55
NA,"State, but the Pilsudski coup d'etat made",55
NA,Poland a Fascist State. The Pilsudski,55
NA,Fascist dictatorship embarked upon a,55
NA,policy of Polandization of tlie con-,55
NA,quered territory. I t made Polish the,55
NA,"official language, withdrew religious",55
NA,freedom by suppressing the Greek Ortho-,55
NA,dox Church in favour of the official,55
NA,"church of Poland, and in general carried",55
NA,out a policy of suppression of those four,55
NA,great freedoms which have since been,55
NA,outlined in the Atlantic Charter. The,55
NA,population was decimated and hundreds,55
NA,of homes were burnt to the ground in a,55
NA,vain endeavour to repress the inhabi-,55
NA,tants of the annexed regions. The people,55
NA,of Galicia resisted this oppression almost,55
NA,to the day when they were liberated by,55
NA,the Red Army.,55
NA,"On the 4th September, 1939, Germany",55
NA,"invaded Poland. The Polish Army, hope-",55
NA,lessly out of date and consisting mainly,55
NA,"of horse cavalry, was no match for the-",55
NA,modern mechanized army of Germany-,55
NA,"Despite the courage of its soldiers, Poland,",55
NA,"went down in defeat within a fortnight;,",55
NA,"and the Polish Government, which had'",55
NA,"rejected Soviet aid, fled the country. I n .",55
NA,these circumstances the Government of,55
NA,the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,55
NA,ordered the Red Army into eastern.,55
NA,"Poland on the 17th September, in order",55
NA,to protect from Nazi brutality its blood,55
NA,brothers the Byelo-Russians and the,55
NA,"Ukrainians in eastern Poland, and to",55
NA,make secure the rich corn-fields and,55
NA,mineral deposits of the Ukraine. By its,55
NA,"march into Poland, the Soviet Union",55
NA,"saved from Nazi bestialities, for the time",55
NA,"being, millions of Ukrainians, Byelo-",55
NA,"Russians and Jews, increased the distance",55
NA,between Germany and the old Soviet,55
NA,"frontier, and gained additional time in",55
NA,which to strengthen its defences against,55
NA,the attack which it knew must come.,55
NA,"This action, ofi course, gave a new lease of",55
NA,life to all those propaganda agencies,55
NA,which had been busily lying about the,55
NA,Soviet Union from its earliest days.,55
NA,Mr Lloyd George came out strongly,55
NA,against those who recklessly demanded,55
NA,stern action against the .Soviet Union. I,55
NA,quote an extract from a letter sent to the,55
NA,Polish Ambassador in London on the,55
NA,"and 28th September, 1939-",55
NA,I t is a notorious fact that the Polish peasants,55
NA,are living in great poverty owing to the,55
NA,operation of the worst feudal system in,55
NA,Europe. That aristocracy has been practically,55
NA,in power for years. A l l the promises of con-,55
NA,cessions made from time to time to the,55
NA,peasants have been thwarted by its influence,55
NA,on recent Polish Governments. That is why,55
NA,the advancing Russian troops are being hailed,55
NA,by the peasants as deliverers.,55
NA,The German invasion is designed to annex,56
NA,to the Reich provinces where the decided,56
NA,"majority of the population is Polish by race,",56
NA,"language and tradition. On the other hand,",56
NA,the Russian armies marched into territories,56
NA,"which are not Polish, and which were forcibly",56
NA,"annexed by Poland after the Great War, in",56
NA,spite of the fierce protests and the armed,56
NA,resistance of the inhabitants. The inhabi-,56
NA,tants of Polish Ukraine are of the same race,56
NA,and language as their neighbours in the,56
NA,Ukrainian Republic of the Soviet Union.,56
NA,I felt it was a matter of primary import-,56
NA,ance to call attention at once to these salient,56
NA,considerations lest we commit ourselves,56
NA,rashly to war against Russia under tlie impres-,56
NA,sion that her intervention was identical with,56
NA,that of Germany. The distinction between,56
NA,the two cases is increasingly acknowledged by,56
NA,British and French opinion. In these circum-,56
NA,stances it would be an act of criminal folly,56
NA,to place the Russian advance in the same,56
NA,"category as that of the Germans, although it",56
NA,would suit Herr Hitler's designs that we,56
NA,should do so. I am delighted that our Govern-,56
NA,ment have shown no indication of committing,56
NA,this country to such an attitude or enter-,56
NA,prise.,56
NA,"The Soviet Union had thus blocked, for",56
NA,"the time being, any further German ad-",56
NA,"7S11C6. A t 4 a.m. on the 22nd June, 1941,",56
NA,it was attacked by German forces. These,56
NA,"events are fresh i n the minds of, every-",56
NA,body. There were some who predicted a,56
NA,swift Russian collapse. I believe that,56
NA,"they were, and for that matter still are,",56
NA,disappointed that this event did not occur.,56
NA,The Red Army was forced to retreat many,56
NA,"hundreds of miles, but i t did not lose its",56
NA,"fighting efficiency. Now, of course, the",56
NA,"battle has been taken to German soil,",56
NA,Poland having heen liberated on the,56
NA,way.,56
NA,The Leader of the Opposition,56
NA,Menzies) was concerned lest,56
NA,Lublin Provisional Government-a,56
NA,vernment on the spot-should,56
NA,reflect the opinion of the,56
NA,of the Poles. By wishful,56
NA,he reasoned that perhaps the emigre,56
NA,Government in London might represent,56
NA,Polish opinion. It must be admitted,56
NA,that until a ftree election has been held,56
NA,"there is room for doubt, however slender",56
NA,it might be. Had the right honorable,56
NA,gentleman taken the trouble to study,56
NA,"the decisions of the Yalta Conference,",56
NA,he would have found that the question,56
NA,had been answered in advance. That con-,56
NA,ference laid it down that the Lublin Go-,56
NA,vernment must be so broadened by the,56
NA,inclusion of democratic elements at home,56
NA,Mr Mountjoy.,56
NA,and abroad as to make i t trul y repre-,56
NA,sentative of all shades of Polish opinion;,56
NA,"and further, that free elections must be",56
NA,held at the earliest possible moment.,56
NA,I think that I have said enough to show,56
NA,that fears as to Poland's future are,56
NA,without foundation. The Sydney Morn-,56
NA,"ing Herald of the 1st March, published a",56
NA,leading article i n which the following,56
NA,comments occurred:-,56
NA,"To those critics who, like Sir William",56
NA,"Beveridge, seem prone already to anticipate",56
NA,"having to make a choice between "" friends",56
NA,"and principles"", Mr Churchill said, in effect,",56
NA,they could not hope to enjoy both tlie luxury of,56
NA,old prejudices and the benefits of a co-operative,56
NA,international society freed from the menace of,56
NA,war. To have faith in a world peace organiza-,56
NA,tion and no faith in Russia is an incongruity,56
NA,for which there can be no accommodation in,56
NA,"the post-war world, where materially and",56
NA,psychologically every nation will have to be,56
NA,"rebuilt afresh, and rebuilt as a member of an",56
NA,international order devoted to the outlawing,56
NA,of war. The ideal may prove to be beyond,56
NA,"human roach, but at least if the world means",56
NA,to strive for it there can be no condoning of,56
NA,such suspicions as those which Mr Churchill,56
NA,condemned.,56
NA,I t is this incompatibility of aims which lm?,56
NA,disfigured the activities of the Polish Govern-,56
NA,"ment in London, and exposes the weak case of",56
NA,those who protest that the Yalta resolutions,56
NA,are a desertion of the principles of the Atlantic,56
NA,Charter and of Britain's pre-war pledge to,56
NA,Poland. Obviously the London Poles had no,56
NA,"voice in the redrawing of the map of Poland,",56
NA,or in the debates on the establishment of the,56
NA,"""Provisional Polish Government of National",56
NA,"Unity "", which the Allies have agreed shall be",56
NA,set up in place of both the London Govern-,56
NA,ment and the Lublin Committee. But on what,56
NA,ground is it maintained that there is no,56
NA,"majority Polish view in favour of the Allies',",56
NA,"arrangement; and how, save at the free elec-",56
NA,( Mr tions to be held under the new Provisional,56
NA,"the Government, is the voice of Poland to be ascer-",56
NA,go- tained? In the political administration there,56
NA,is nothing settled which the prescribed vote of,56
NA,"not the Polish people themselves cannot change,",56
NA,"majority and, if the London Poles did not participate",56
NA,"thinking, with the Lublin Committee in the preliminary",56
NA,"negotiations in Moscow, that is due solely t""",56
NA,their obstinate refusal to do so. The necessity,56
NA,for some interim administration in the,56
NA,liberated country before the end of the war,56
NA,was clearly pointed out by Mr Churchill:,56
NA,"Russia, he said, as the instrument of Poland's",56
NA,"liberation, had a right, while engaged in large-",56
NA,"scale operations against the heart of Germany,",56
NA,to have her army communications assured in,56
NA,an orderly countryside.,56
NA,As for the objection to the redrawing of,56
NA,"Poland's eastern boundary, Mr Churchill",56
NA,"justly protested that the "" Curzon line"" is not",56
NA,"a Russian imposition on Pola,nd, but an",56
NA,ethnographical border proposed by the British,56
NA,Foreign Office in 1919. In 1939 i t was made,56
NA,quite clear by tlie British Government that its,57
NA,guarantee to Poland related to the meditated,57
NA,German aggression and was never intended t °,57
NA,cover her eastern frontiers. The territorial,57
NA,"compensation now proposed for Poland,",57
NA,"especially on the Baltic, will make not only",57
NA,for a stronger State but also for one more,57
NA,easily protected by its sponsors. I t was the,57
NA,exposure of the pre-war Poland to German,57
NA,aggression which made any guarantee of her,57
NA,independence so precarious. Only Russia's,57
NA,strong arm and goodwill can preserve Polan.,57
NA,"from any future German attack, and, in that",57
NA,"responsibility, Russia is entitled to be assured",57
NA,of the best position for any such action com-,57
NA,patible with ethnographical realities. Tin:,57
NA,"critics, Polish or other, of the Allies' plan can-",57
NA,not be brought to explain why an eastern,57
NA,frontier which was adjudged just in 1919 by,57
NA,experts who certainly had no prejudices in,57
NA,"favour of Soviet Russia, should be considered",57
NA,a.ny less so to-day.,57
NA,That leading article more than answers,57
NA,the accusations of the Leader of the,57
NA,Opposition and the honorable mem-,57
NA,ber for Barker ( Mr Archie Cameron).,57
NA,He would be a bold man who,57
NA,would say that that journal is pre-,57
NA,judiced in favour of the Soviet Union.,57
NA,Not even the Leader of the Opposition,57
NA,"would make such a charge, especially in",57
NA,view of the large amount of space that,57
NA,that newspaper now gives to him for the,57
NA,purpose of spreading his anti-Australian,57
NA,theories.,57
NA,A great deal of progressive legislation,57
NA,has be«n outlined in the Governor-,57
NA,General's Speech. That fact has been,57
NA,seized upon by members of the Opposi-,57
NA,tion who now accuse the Government of,57
NA,distracting the minds of the people from,57
NA,the immediate tasks of war. The facts are.,57
NA,"of course, that the plutocrats are tired of",57
NA,"the war, and it is their propaganda that",57
NA,is disturbing the people's minds. The,57
NA,workers are not fools. I t is as patent to,57
NA,them as to anybody else that the glitter-,57
NA,"ing promise of the "" new order "" made by",57
NA,"scared reactionaries back in 1941, and",57
NA,"early in 1942, is not to be honoured. I f a",57
NA,""" new order "" is to be, i t must be fought",57
NA,for. Any one who thinks that the people,57
NA,who now hold power and wealth will re-,57
NA,treat from their position of privilege will,57
NA,be sadly mistaken. Vested interests have,57
NA,already commenced their offensive. Tens,57
NA,"of thousands of pounds, which should be",57
NA,"going into war loans, are now being",57
NA,spent on anti-working class propaganda.,57
NA,"Newspaper space, leaflets and radio time",57
NA,are being used in an attempt to create,57
NA,a feeling of distrust and doubt. The,57
NA,"working people can quite easily see that,",57
NA,if they are to be i n a position to meet,57
NA,this offensive on their wages and con-,57
NA,"ditions when the war is over, they must",57
NA,build up wages and conditions now while,57
NA,they have the chance. The amount of,57
NA,industrial unrest is directly propor-,57
NA,tionate to the volume and intensity of,57
NA,the propaganda o f the O p p o s i t i o n forces.,57

NA,I shall not read the names of the signa-,57
NA,"tories, as I know that many of them are",57
NA,"clients of private banks, and to read",57
NA,their nameswould leave them open to,57
NA,"victimization by those "" benevolent"" in-",57
NA,stitutions. I t will be noted that they also,57
NA,"support the Scully wheat scheme, and as",57
NA,the twisted reasoning of the honorable,57
NA,member for Indi ( Mr MCEwen) has,57
NA,once again been exposed by my friend,57

NA,"by the honorable memiber for Indi, Mr.",57

NA,to smash the Australian Wheat Board,57
NA,and land the growers back into the,57
NA,"tender hands of the wheat agents, once",57
NA,more to be mercilessly exploited. The,57
NA,events of the last five years have clearly,57
NA,shown that only a Labour Government,57
NA,has the courage and capacity to lead,57
NA,the nation in these difficult times. The,57
NA,events of tie future will show that only,58
NA,a Labour Government has the courage,58
NA,and foresight to meet the difficult periods,58
NA,ahead. Just as it planned to meet the,58
NA,war situation it now plans for peace.,58
NA,"The ,pToblem of Australia's need for",58
NA,increased population seems to be a hardy,58
NA,"annual in this chamber. Undoubtedly,",58
NA,this country needs more people. That,58
NA,cannot be denied. Neither can i t be,58
NA,denied that the best way to increase the,58
NA,population is to rely on the natural,58
NA,"increase, but the solution is not so simple",58
NA,"that we merely need a ""grow more",58
NA,"babies"" campaign. I f we are to have",58

NA,increase the population and have .that,58

NA,"-under bridges, or filling unemployment",58
NA,-camps. We need more people to increase,58
NA,the wealth of our country and to develop,58
NA,our natural resources to a greater degree,58
NA,than at present. Numbers of people,58
NA,alone do not increase wealth. Only by,58

NA,are the wealth producers. The gilded,58
NA,society damsel or the wealthy loafer in,58
NA,his club chair produce no more wealth,58
NA,than the poor unfortunate sheltering,58
NA,"under a bridge, although, of course, one",58
NA,gets the lion's share of the wealth.,58
NA,"Some one else produces, and the other,",58
NA,"denied the right to work, has perfect",58
NA,freedom to starve.,58
NA,"It follows, then, that before populatremendous",58
NA,tion is increased work should be guaranland,58
NA,teed. How is this work to be found?,58
NA,I suggest that that can be done in two,58
NA,ways. In the first place we should,58
NA,expand secondary industries. In this,58
NA,field Western Australia opens up almost,58
NA,untouched resources. In that State there,58
NA,are. large deposits of almost every,58
NA,mineral known to man. The honorable,58
NA,member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Johnson),58
NA,has told us something about those reare,58
NA,"sources, and about his personal observaEast",58
NA,"tions in that part of Australia. SeconIndia,",58
NA,dary industry could be expanded if,58
NA,employed more people than at present in,58
NA,processing our own wool and making,58
NA,own cloth. We were told to-day that,58
NA,Mr Mount joy.,58
NA,double-weft cloth is being made in Aus-,58
NA,tralia in order to capture the New Zea-,58
NA,land market. I f that work can be,58
NA,done in the eastern States it can also,58
NA,"be done in Western Australia, because",58
NA,the Albany Woollen Mills are capable,58
NA,of competing with any other mills of,58
NA,the kind in the Commonwealth. The,58
NA,second way in which I suggest work,58
NA,could be found is by expanding primary,58
NA,"production. During the present drought,",58
NA,Western Australia has once again proved,58
NA,the sheet-anchor of Australia in the,58
NA,supply of grain. That State occasionally,58
NA,"experiences dry years, but a general",58
NA,drought is unknown there. I t has never,58
NA,had a devastating drought such as that,58
NA,experienced in the eastern States. I n the,58
NA,safest rainfall area in Australia-south -,58
NA,"western Australia-18,000,00 0 acres of",58
NA,"country, after providing for forests,",58
NA,awaits development. The climate in that,58
NA,area-a s a white man's country-ha s no,58
NA,peer in all the world. Western Aus-,58
NA,tralia grows the best grapes in the Com-,58
NA,"monwealth, although that statement may",58
NA,be contested by honorable memlbers from,58
NA,South Australia. I f any honorable,58
NA,member will visit the Swan Valley with,58
NA,"me, I shall show him that, although",58
NA,Western Australia does not make a,58
NA,"great deal of wine, it produces the best.",58
NA,This has been proved many times by,58
NA,"wines from the Houghton vineyards, at",58
NA,"Middle Swan, which have defeated those",58
NA,of all-comers at the Melbourne Royal,58
NA,"Show, including Seppelts, Penfolds, and",58
NA,other well-known makers. Those safe,58
NA,rainfall areas in Western Australia have,58
NA,"potentialities; but, if closer",58
NA,"settlement is to be made a reality,",58
NA,large estates will have to be subdivided.,58
NA,"Some of these estates have been developed,",58
NA,but others are covered with virgin bush.,58
NA,Another problem which must be faced,58
NA,is to find markets in which to sell our,58
NA,"surplus products, and the more we develop",58
NA,the land the greater will be the surplus.,58
NA,"Viewing this problem as a layman, it",58
NA,seems to me that our natural markets,58
NA,"to be found, not in Europe, but in",58
NA,"Asia. The people of Java, China,",58
NA,"Burma and the Malay States, i f",58
NA,"we they had a higher standard of living,",58
NA,could use more goods than Australia could,58
NA,our ever produce. The Soviet Union could,58
NA,take a tremendous quantity of our wool.,58
NA,The people of Australia have a very real,59
NA,interest in the standard 'of living of our,59
NA,"near neighbours, and we should use what",59
NA,influence we have in world affairs to,59
NA,assist them to secure political inde-,59
NA,pendence.,59
NA,I am firmly convinced that the basic,59
NA,cause of the declining birth-rate is,59
NA,"economic, as is borne out by vital",59
NA,statistics-,59
NA,1928 .. ..,59
NA,1929 .. ..,59
NA,1930 ..,59
NA,1931 .. ..,59
NA,1932 .. .. 16.86,59
NA,1933 :. 10.78,59
NA,1934 .. ..,59
NA,Honorable members will note the,59
NA,gradual decline during the depression,59
NA,"years. I n 1934, the volume of employ-",59
NA,"ment increased a little, so that in 1936 the",59
NA,"birth-rate rose to 16.55. I n 1936, it rose",59
NA,"still further to 17.13, in 19'37 to 17.43, in",59
NA,"1938 to 17.46, and in 1939, the last year",59
NA,"for which figures are available, it was",59
NA,17.65. These figures definitely show that,59
NA,the birth-rate rises and falls according to,59
NA,the economic standard of the people. Of,59
NA,"""course, the answer given in advance to",59
NA,this contention by the right honorable,59
NA,member for North Sydney ( Mr Hughes),59
NA,i? that the more money people possess the,59
NA,fewer children they have. He points to,59
NA,the wealthy classes and says that they,59
NA,have very few children. He points to,59
NA,the working class and says that they,59
NA,have most children. That is perfectly,59
NA,"true, but he fails to point out that history",59
NA,has always shown that a dying class has,59
NA,"no faith in the future, being concerned",59
NA,only with the selfish pursuit of pleasure.,59
NA,The rich woman will not have children,59
NA,because they would interfere with her,59
NA,"social engagements. I n the main, such",59
NA,people look upon children as a nuisance.,59
NA,"The working-class woman, on the other",59
NA,"hand, likes and has children. I n her",59
NA,case the limiting factors are economic-,59
NA,"the fear of insecurity of employment, the",59
NA,thought that a son lovingly raised may,59
NA,"be killed in a future war, and the fear",59
NA,that a son or daughter will not be able to,59
NA,find a job. The inability properly to,59
NA,"feed, clothe and educate a family are",59
NA,powerful limiting factors.,59
NA,The honorable member for Parkes ( Mr.,59
NA,Haylen) is in my corner when he advo-,59
NA,cates marriage loans. I go further and,59
NA,"say, let the fear of unemployment be",59
NA,abolished; let us ensure that every child,59
NA,"born in Australia shall be properly fed,",59
NA,"clothed, housed and educated, and its",59
NA,future guaranteed. We should provide,59
NA,free kindergartens and free the working-,59
NA,class mother from kitchen drudgery by,59
NA,Birth-rate. giving her the benefit of such modern,59
NA,"21.27 appliances as washing machines, electric",59
NA,21.25 cooking and refrigeration. We should get,59
NA,ISI.86 on with our building programme now in,59
NA,18.10 order to relieve the serious housing,59
NA,shortage. We recognize that the present,59
NA,10.39 Government has inherited from previous,59
NA,"governments a housing problem, but",59
NA,much could be done immediately to relieve,59
NA,the present situation. One way would,59
NA,be to compel people to make available,59
NA,accommodation which they do not need.,59
NA,I t is only necessary to go to any of the,59
NA,fashionable seaside resorts to see houses,59
NA,which arc not being occupied. Huge,59
NA,"mansions with a great number of rooms,",59
NA,that are inhabited by only two or three,59
NA,"people, should be divided into flats. The",59
NA,owner could have one and the other flats,59
NA,"should be let. Of course, i t would still be",59
NA,necessary to build_ many houses and we,59
NA,should begin to do so immediately. The,59
NA,housing situation is desperate now-wha t,59
NA,will it be when the servicemen are,59
NA,demobilized? The position in Perth may,59
NA,not be as bad as in some of the other,59
NA,"capital cities, but it is bad enough. I",59
NA,"know one man who, with his wife and",59
NA,"thirteen children, is living in a shack",59
NA,which no decent person should be required,59
NA,"to live in, while just across the road is",59
NA,an empty military camp in which the,59
NA,buildings are being destroyed by vandals,59
NA,because there is no one to look after them.,59
NA,We should provide houses of which people,59
NA,can be proud at rents which they can,59
NA,"afford to pay, or we should sell them at",59
NA,prices which they can afford to give. I f,59
NA,we improve economic conditions as I,59
NA,"have suggested, and provide proper hous-",59
NA,"ing and amenities for the people, the",59
NA,problem of the declining birth-rate will,59
NA,solve itself.,59

NA,QUESTIONS-WHEA T INDUSTRY-,60

NA,Motion (by Mr CHXFLEY) proposed-,60
NA,That the House do now adjourn.,60
Mr HOLT ,Fawkner) [ 1 0 . 7 ] -,60
NA,pose to discuss a matter which I believe,60
NA,"to be of great constitutional importance,",60
NA,"namely, tlie announcement made through",60
NA,the press that the Prime Minister ( M,60
NA,Curtin) proposed to vary the customary,60
NA,method of dealing with questions asked,60
NA,without notice i n this House. The i n,60
NA,mation was that he himself would answer,60
NA,only such questions of urgency as were,60
NA,directed to h i m by party leaders.,60
NA,regret that the Prime Minister himself,60
NA,not present. I understand that he is i,60
NA,and I hope that he w i l l have a speedy,60
NA,recovery. I regard this matter as of,60
NA,"such importance that, even i n the",60
NA,"absence of the Prime Minister, ParliaGeneral's",60
NA,ment cannot allow the announcement to,60
NA,pass without comment. This is a time,60
NA,when private members of Parliament,60
NA,must assert as powerfully as they can,60
NA,"the rights whicli they possess, and the",60
NA,"rights which, through them, the citizens",60
NA,of the Commonwealth have to air their,60
NA,grievances i n Parliament. Question time,60
NA,in this House has acquired a good deal,60
NA,"of significance, particularly i n recent",60
NA,years. I recall a conversation which,60
NA,had some time ago on this subject with,60
NA,"Professor Kenneth Bailey, who has",60
NA,advised the Government on constitutional,60
NA,matters. I n i t he stressed the imporhim,60
NA,tance which question time has acquired,60
NA,in the proceedings of the National,60
NA,Parliament. When we are faced w i t h,60
NA,the possibility of so grave a departure,60
NA,from custom as that announced by the,60
NA,"Prime Minister, i t calls f o r discussion,",60
NA,and f o r a defence by private members,60
NA,of the rights which they have hitherto,60
NA,enjoyed.,60
NA,I t is misleading to attach too much,60
NA,importance to the practice i n other,60
NA,liaments. Each Parliament develops,60
NA,own practices and traditions. I n some,60
NA,of the State Parliaments of Australia,60
NA,is the practice to devote more time,60
NA,private members' business than is done,60
NA,"in this Parliament, Therefore, private",60
NA,members of this Parliament must guard,60
NA,jealously their limited opportunities,60
NA,bring before Ministers and the Govern-,60
NA,ment matters which they feel should,60
NA,be ventilated. I t has been said,60
NA,by Ministers and Government sup-,60
NA,porters that the time devoted to questions,60
NA,"without notice, as well as the number",60
NA,"I proof questions asked, has grown. That is",60
NA,"true, but the growth can easily be ex-",60
NA,plained. The increase of the number of,60
NA,questions arises f r o m the fact that the,60
NA,r . business attended to by this Parliament,60
NA,has grown and that the number of,60
NA,matters which come to the notice of,60
NA,t i - individual members has increased enor-,60
NA,"mously i n recent years, particularly dur-",60
NA,ing the war. Those of us who have had a,60
NA,I decade or more of service i n this Parlia-,60
NA,is ment w i l l remember that a comparatively,60
NA,"l l , limited range of matters came before us",60
NA,"for attention, say, ten years ago. We had",60
NA,"the budget to discuss, and various matters",60
NA,"relating to (pensions, or the Postmaster-",60
NA,Department or the Defence,60
NA,"Department came before us, but there was",60
NA,"nothing like the mass of detail, or the",60
NA,complex questions that there are to-day.,60
NA,W i t h that growth of the number of mat-,60
NA,ters dealt with by the Parliament there,60
NA,has been an increase 'of the number of,60
NA,questions properly put to Ministers. I say,60
NA,"properly put, because otherwise you, Mr .",60
NA,"Speaker, would restrain the questioner.",60
NA,Had the Prime Minister said that his,60
NA,I health was such that he could not give,60
NA,personal attention to these matters i n the,60
NA,"House, all of us would have sympathized",60
NA,with hi m and accepted the nomination by,60
NA,of some deputy to deal with matters,60
NA,"brought to his notice, but that is not the",60
NA,reason that is advanced. The justifica-,60
NA,tion f o r the proposed change is said to be,60
NA,"that the number of questions has grown,",60
NA,and that too much time is devoted to,60
NA,them. I point out that the Prime Minis-,60
NA,ter is more than the head of the Govern-,60
NA,"ment, although i n that capacity there are",60
NA,matters which should he brought to his,60
NA,"notice, and to which satisfactory replies",60
NA,Parare desired. The Prime Minister is also,60
NA,its the head of an important government,60
NA,department-th e Prime Minister's De-,60
NA,"i t partment-and , as the Leader of the",60
NA,to Opposition ( Mr Menzies) pointed out,60
NA,"earlier to-day, he is also Minister f or",60
NA,"Defence, and i n that capacity co-",60
NA,"ordinates, through the Defence Depart-",60
NA,"to ment, matters of policy which arise in",60
NA,"other service departments. To him, there-",61
NA,"fore, we must look for decisions or",61
NA,announcements on matters of defence,61
NA,"policy which affect all the services, as",61
NA,distinct from those which affect them in-,61
NA,dividually. I f the private members of,61
NA,this Parliament are to be denied oppor-,61
NA,tunities normally available to them to,61
NA,place questions before the Prime Minis-,61
NA,ter in his capacity as head of the -Govern-,61
NA,"ment, or as head of thePrime Minister's",61
NA,"Department, or as Minister for Defence,",61
NA,a great cross-section of public adminis-,61
NA,tration in this country will be cut off,61
NA,from inquiry. As the result of security,61
NA,"provisions, there has been a limitation of",61
NA,the range of matters on which members,61
NA,can obtain information. I mentioned,61
NA,earlier that the number of matters to be,61
NA,dealt with has grown tremendously. I f,61
NA,"we take the budget figures alone, and",61
NA,compare a pre-war budget of under,61
NA,"£100,000,000 with a war-time budget",61
NA,providing for an expenditure of,61
NA,"£700,000,000 a year, we get a side-light'",61
NA,on the growth of matters dealt with by,61
NA,this Parlia?nent. I t has been said that,61
NA,we still have the opportunity to place,61
NA,"questions on the notice-paper, bnt I sub-",61
NA,mit that that is not a satisfactory alternations,61
NA,"tive. Obviously, there are some matters",61
NA,"which, because of the detailed nature of",61
NA,the questions or the necessity to obtain,61
NA,"information 'before they can be answered,",61
NA,must be placed on the notice-paper. One,61
NA,very great merit in the practice of sub-,61
NA,mitting questions publicly in the House,61
NA,is that such questions are heard by all,61
NA,"members of the Government, as well as",61
NA,"by supporters of the Government, and as",61
NA,such questions sometimes have ramifica-,61
NA,tions which extend beyond one depart-,61
NA,"ment, the questioner can be assured that",61
NA,his representations will receive immediate,61
NA,attention by all the Ministers involved.,61
NA,Those of us who have had experience as,61
NA,Ministers know that matters referred to,61
NA,"in questions asked in this place, as dis-",61
NA,tinct from those placed on the notice-,61
NA,paper make a greater impression on the,61
NA,"mind of a Minister. I n the main, the",61
NA,questions placed on the notice-paper,61
NA,"relate to matters concerning which, replies",61
NA,are prepared by departmental officers and,61
NA,brought to Ministers for confirmation,61
NA,and signature. There is so much of merit,61
NA,and value in' the practice which has,61
NA,developed in this place that it has .become,61
NA,one of the features of the life of this Par-,61
NA,liament. I t has taken the place which,61
NA,private members' business takes in other,61
NA,"Parliaments, and even i f an hour each",61
NA,day be devoted to a consideration of these,61
NA,"matters, i t is time well spent in protect-",61
NA,ing the rights of individuals. Those,61
NA,"rights call for greater attention to-day,",61
NA,when war-time pressure has caused the,61
NA,Executive to encroach more than,61
NA,ever on the freedom of individuals.,61
NA,As some justification for the attitude,61
NA,adopted by the Prime Minister in this,61
NA,"matter, the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) this",61
NA,afternoon quoted a precedent set by Mr.,61
NA,"Bruce in 1929, when he was Prime Minis-",61
NA,ter. .Since then I have indulged in some,61
NA,research and I find that the facts are not,61
NA,quite as the Treasurer presented them to,61
NA,"us. On the 22nd August, 1929, the then",61
NA,"Prime Minister, Mr Bruce, indicated",61
NA,that he and his Ministers would answer,61
NA,only questions which dealt with matters,61
NA,of urgency. He said-,61
NA,"To save time, and in order that there may",61
NA,he full opportunity to obtain the information,61
NA,"which honorable members require, the Govern-",61
NA,ment has decided to ask for notice of all ques-,61
NA,except such as may be veTy urgent. This,61
NA,wil l ensure that more satisfactory replies can,61
NA,be given.,61
NA,"Later, he added-",61
NA,As there is a full programme of legislation,61
NA,"to be put through this session, the Government",61
NA,proposes not to answer questions without,61
NA,notice unless they have this element of urgency.,61
NA,Honorable members will notice that Mr.,61
NA,Bruce did not exclude himself from the,61
NA,"responsibility of dealing with questions,",61
NA,nor did he confine that responsibility to,61
NA,questions put to him by party leaders.,61
NA,He indicated that it was a practice to be,61
NA,followed by all members of his Govern-,61
NA,ment. Of eight questions addressed t<»,61
NA,"Ministers on the 23rd August, 1929, the",61
NA,then Prime Minister answered four. On,61
NA,"the next sitting day, the 2St,h, he replied",61
NA,to five out of the ten questions addressed,61
NA,"to Ministers, the 29th three out of three,",61
NA,and the 30th five out of seven. On the,61
NA,"4th Septemlber, the next sitting clay, he",61
NA,"replied to seven out of eleven, and on",61
NA,the 5th September seven out of nine.,61
NA,Even up to the issue of that edict by Mr.,61
NA,Bruce questions had not at any time,61
NA,"reached our standard to-day, either in the",61
NA,number asked or the length of time,61
NA,"occupied. Despite the edict, he personally",62
NA,"answered more than 50 per cent, of the",62
NA,questions in the first six sitting days,62
NA,after he had made the statement. So,62
NA,we cannot accept the practice adopted,62
NA,by Mr Bruce as a precedent. Perhaps the,62
NA,"Prime Minister, not being in the best",62
NA,"of health, has allowed himself to be led-",62
NA,into a decision which is at variance with,62
NA,the traditional respect that he has always,62
NA,shown to the traditions of Parliament,62
NA,and the rights and privileges of the,62
NA,members of this Parliament. I f that,62
NA,"is the case, I hope that even i f he feels",62
NA,that he is not physically able to stand,62
NA,up to whatever effort is involved in,62
NA,"answering questions, he will nominate a",62
NA,deputy who will have full authority to,62
NA,speak on his behalf as Prime Minister,62
NA,and as Minister for Defence. Unless,62
NA,"we can be assured of that, I and",62
NA,"other private members must insist, not",62
NA,"only for ourselves, but also for the",62
NA,institution of which we are a part and,62
NA,"the people outside, who look to us for",62
NA,free expression in protection of their,62
NA,"rights, on opposing the practice now",62
NA,indicated and demand restoration of the,62
NA,.privileges that we have enjoyed in the,62
NA,past.,62
Mr ABBOTT ,New England) [10.22].,62
NA,- I support the remarks of the honor-,62
NA,able member for Fawkner ( Mr Holt),62
NA,concerning the announcement by the,62
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Ourtin) to the,62
NA,press that he would reply only to ques-,62
NA,tions asked by the party leaders.,62
NA,cannot understand the attitude of the,62
NA,Government on this matter. Preserva-,62
NA,tion of the liberties of the people was,62
NA,the very basis of the policy of the,62
NA,Labour party. Every member on this,62
NA,side of the chamber is most sympathetic,62
NA,towards tlie Prime Minister during his,62
NA,illness. We do not want to embarrass him,62
NA,"at all. However, every honorable member",62
NA,realizes that the business of the country,62
NA,"must go on and that, i f his health is not",62
NA,"so good as it should be, the rights of",62
NA,Parliament should not be abrogated. The,62
NA,Prime Minister should have a rest or.,62
NA,as the honorable^ member for Fawkner,62
NA,"suggested, he should appoint some one",62
NA,to answer questions on his behalf. I n the,62
NA,"midst of a great war, when all sorts of",62
NA,rules and regulations are being made by,62
NA,the Government which never come before,62
NA,Parliament until they are imposed on the,62
NA,"public, i t is absolutely essential that",62
NA,the rights of honorable members,62
NA,should be protected and that private,62
NA,members on either side should be able,62
NA,to question the Prime Minister and,62
NA,other Ministers about what is hap-,62
NA,pening i n the conduct of the war or,62
NA,"the Government's policy, or to expose",62
NA,abuses which may be taking place. I t,62
NA,is all very well to say that we have the,62
NA,opportunity to speak on the adjourn-,62
NA,"ment of the House, but tbat comes very",62
NA,late indeed.,62
Sir FREDERICK STEWART ,An d 'thews,62
NA,is not a big audience.,62
Mr ABBOTT ,"Yes , but that does",62
NA,not matter. The point is that at ques-,62
NA,"tion time, when every one is present in",62
NA,"the House, what is asked is flashed to",62
NA,almost every part of Australia. I t is,62
NA,absolutely essential that that period of,62
NA,interrogation should not be in any way,62
NA,restricted. The only way i n which to,62
NA,make a government with the majority,62
NA,which this Government possesses realize,62
NA,that it may have to do certain things,62
NA,or not do other things is to create a,62
NA,public opinion which will make i t realize,62
NA,"that, if i t carries on in the way that i t is",62
NA,"carrying on, the public will turn away",62
NA,from it. That is the greatest protection,62
NA,that democracy has. I t is the very,62
NA,negation of democracy for the Govern-,62
NA,ment to attempt to suppress the asking,62
NA,of questions.,62
Mr CHIFLEY ,N o one is suppressing,62
NA,the asking of questions.,62
Mr ABBOTT,Question s are being,62
NA,"suppressed. I f the Prime Minister,",62
NA,in contravention of the Standing Orders,62
NA,"of this House, says that he will answer",62
NA,Dnly questions asked by the Leader of,62
NA,the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) and the,62
NA,Leader of the Australian Country party,62
NA,"( Mr Fadden), as representing the Oppo-",62
NA,"sition, and that i f private members",62
NA,"ask questions he will ignore them, he",62
NA,is interfering with the rights and,62
NA,privileges of honorable members and,62
NA,preventing them from airing their,62
NA,grievances. Only last week I asked,62
NA,the Minister for the Army ( Mr Forde),62
NA,a question about the recapture of,62
NA,"Nauru and Ocean Islands, and, before",62
NA,the Minister for the Army could even,62
NA,"answer, the Prime Minister, like a new",62
NA,"Henry V., jumped into the breach and",63
NA,replied himself. I do not know whether,63
NA,he was afraid that the Minister for the,63
NA,"A.rmy would give the wrong reply, but",63
NA,if the direction that the Prime Minister,63
NA,is not to be asked questions by private,63
NA,"members is to be enforced, will he refrain",63
NA,from answering questions asked of other,63
NA,Ministers? I do not want to embarrass,63
NA,the Prime Minister in his illness. He,63
NA,needs a long rest to recuperate. But i t,63
NA,is a shocking and woeful departure from,63
NA,an established practice if honorable mem-,63
NA,bers will not be answered by Ministers,63
NA,"unless in the view of Ministers, the",63
NA,questions are urgent. That is wrong.,63
NA,Very often a question is asked and in,63
NA,the reply the public gets a view of what,63
NA,actually happening. [Quorum formed.],63
NA,"I t is wrong, indeed, for the Government,",63
NA,"in contravention of the Standing Orders,",63
NA,to deny private members the right to ask,63
NA,questions. I t is absurd to say that an,63
NA,honorable memiber is able to open up a,63
NA,question as effectively by putting it on,63
NA,the notice-paper as by asking i t without,63
NA,notice. I support the honorable member,63
NA,for Fawkner in his advocacy of. the rights,63
NA,of honorable members. Thev must be,63
NA,preserved. Honorable members must be,63
NA,allowed to ask questions as prescribed by,63
NA,the Standing Orders and should not be,63
NA,"forced to submit to rafferty rules,",63
NA,"announced through the press, without",63
NA,"your consent, Mr .Speaker, or the con-",63
NA,sent of this House. I hope that the Trea-,63
NA,"surer ( Mr Chifley), who is now i n charge",63
NA,"of the House, will pay regard to the",63
NA,"Standing Orders, and thus preserve the",63
NA,rights and privileges of honorable mem-,63
NA,"bers in this democracy, and that no action",63
NA,will be taken to prevent them from let-,63
NA,ting the people of Australia know what,63
NA,"is going on in this Parliament, because,",63
NA,"in effect, that will be the result of the",63
NA,Prime Minister's decision.,63
Mr MCEWEN ,Indi) [10.33] - I re-,63
NA,quest the Government to arrange for the,63
NA,Minister for Commerce and Agriculture,63
NA,( Mr Scully) to make a clear-cut and,63
NA,authoritative announcement regarding,63
NA,tbe policy which it intends to follow with,63
NA,regard to payments into the Nos. 6 and 7,63
NA,wheat pools in respect of wheat sold at,63
NA,concessional prices. I do not propose to,63
NA,"argue the merits of the case, but merely",63
NA,draw attention to a long series of conflict-,63
NA,ing announcements which have either,63
NA,been made by the Minister or attributed,63
NA,to him in reports of proceedings of,63
NA,"various meetings which he has attended,",63
NA,"or deputations he has received, as well as",63
NA,in statements issued from his office. I t is,63
NA,"well known, of course, that in the early",63
NA,stages of the controversy over conces-,63
NA,sional wheat prices the Minister declared,63
NA,that no injustice was being done to,63
NA,growers. He certainly said that no pay-,63
NA,ment should be made to the pools in,63
NA,addition to the original 6d. a bushel sub-,63
NA,"sidy announced by the Government, and",63
NA,provision for which has been made in two,63
NA,"and, perhaps, three, budgets. However,",63
NA,is as the controversy developed and the jus-,63
NA,tice of the opposing case became so clear,63
NA,that it could no longer be defended by the,63
NA,"Government, ' the Minister attended a",63
NA,meeting of the wheat and wool growers,63
NA,organization in New South Wales in July,63
NA,last. I n this House on the 14th Septem-,63
NA,"ber, he quoted what he said at that meet-",63
NA,ing as follows:-,63
NA,"After full consideration, I announced that",63
NA,the price of stock feed would be increased,63
NA,so as to bring it up to the return from,63
NA,the pool concerned.,63
NA,Thus he made it. clear that the returns,63
NA,from the pool sales of wheat for human,63
NA,"consumption, power alcohol distilleries,",63
NA,stock feed and breakfast food would be,63
NA,"averaged, and, insofar as the concessional",63
NA,"sales fell short of that average, the Go-",63
NA,vernment would make up the difference.,63
NA,Whether one agrees with that policy or,63
NA,not the Minister's statement was clear.,63
NA,"I t was accepted by some, but others made",63
NA,it the subject of a controversy. The fact,63
NA,that it was not generally accepted was,63
NA,made clear by a deputation representing,63
NA,the Farmers and Settlers Association,63
NA,which waited upon the Minister on the,63
NA,17th September. His reply to that,63
NA,deputation which requested that the,63
NA,Government liberalize its attitude was,63
NA,reported in the Sydney Morning Herald,63
NA,of the 18th September as follows:-,63
NA,"He had advised the Wheat Board, he said,",63
NA,that the Government would pay the difference,63
NA,between tlie average realization of Nos. 0 and,63
NA,"7 pools, and the concessional price on all",63
NA,wheat sold at concessional rates out of these,63
NA,pools.,63
NA,That was confirmation of what he said,63
NA,"in July, what he reiterated in this House",63
NA,"on the 14th September, and what he i n -",64
NA,formed the deputation on the 17th Sep-,64
NA,tember. On all of those occasions he did,64
NA,"not f a i l to say that the growers, speaking",64
NA,"through their organizations, were satis-",64
NA,"fied. However, the fact that the growers",64
NA,were not satisfied was exemplified by the,64
NA,deputation representing the Farmers and,64
NA,"Settlers Association, and subsequently at",64
NA,a conference of delegates of the Australian,64
NA,Wheatgrowers Federation. Following the,64
NA,"latter conference, Mr Lillie and Mr Stott.",64
NA,the president and secretary of the federa-,64
NA,"tion, issued a statement in. which they",64
NA,said-,64
NA,We wish to make perfectly clear that tlie,64
NA,result of the conference was satisfactory.,64
NA,Regarding the controversy over concessional,64
NA,"prices for stock feed, &c, the Minister made it",64
NA,abundantly clear that concessional prices being,64
NA,"received for sales of wheat for breakfast food,",64
NA,"stock feed and power alcohol, would not be",64
NA,taken into the calculations to ascertain the,64
NA,final realizations of the pool.,64
NA,The Government would make up the dif-,64
NA,ference between the prices received for con-,64
NA,cessional sales and the price received by the,64
NA,Australian Wheat Board on export sales and,64
NA,the home-consumption price.,64
NA,That reported reply by the Minister to,64
NA,the conference represented a more liberal,64
NA,attitude on the part of the Government.,64
NA,I f the report given by those gentlemen,64
NA,"was correct, i t involved the Government",64
NA,providing an additional sum of some,64
NA,millions of pounds over and above what,64
NA,the Minister bad previously indicated the,64
NA,Government was prepared to provide f o r,64
NA,this purpose. I n order to ascertain the,64
NA,real position I asked the Minister i n this,64
NA,House on the 16th November whether he,64
NA,could confirm the report attributed to,64
NA,"Mr Lillie and Mr Stott, and, i f so,",64
NA,whether he and the Government did not,64
NA,think i t more fitting that announcements,64
NA,involving the expenditure of millions of,64
NA,"pounds ought to be made by the Minister,",64
NA,and not by persons who attended a con-,64
NA,"ference. The Minister, i n his reply to which",64
NA,"me, contradicted tlie reply",64
NA,him by -M.v. Lillie and Mr Stott. The,64
NA,Minister also said-,64
NA,The only assurance 1 gave to the deputation,64
NA,was the assurance that I gave to honorable,64
NA,members in replying to a debate on a motion,64
NA,for adjournment moved by the honorable,64
NA,"ber for Indi at our last meeting, when I",64
NA,that average realizations of the pool would,64
NA,Air. MCEwen.,64
NA,"be taken into consideration, and that I in-",64
NA,tended to make a submission to Cabinet seek-,64
NA,ing approval for an amount of money to be,64
NA,placed to the credit of the pool to bring these,64
NA,payments up to the realization figure.,64
NA,"According to that reply, the position had",64
NA,reverted to that outlined in the state-,64
NA,"ment which the Minister made i n July,",64
NA,which he confirmed i n Parliament i n,64
NA,"September, and which he confirmed again",64
NA,in reply to a deputation f r o m the Farmers,64
NA,and Settlers Association on tlie 1.7th Sep-,64
NA,"tember, repudiating the report of the",64
NA,president and secretary of the Wheat,64
NA,Growers Federation and getting back to,64
NA,bis original formula. I can understand,64
NA,that; but the matter did not rest there.,64
NA,"As I said before, I am not attempting",64
NA,to canvass the merits of this particular,64
NA,controversy. I am only trying to elicit,64
NA,"at long last a statement of fact, from",64
NA,the Minister.,64
NA,The next authoritative announcement,64
NA,in this extraordinary series was made by,64
NA,the chairman of the Australian Wheat,64
NA,"Board, Sir Olive MCPherson, on the 23rd",64
NA,January last. He stated that the board,64
NA,had been informed by the Government,64
NA,"that i t had decided to eliminate ""wheat",64
NA,sold f o r stock feed from the calculation,64
NA,of compensation to the wheat-growers in,64
NA,"the No. 6 and No. 7 pools. There again,",64
NA,that is one formula which can be applied,64
NA,to this particular problem. I t is a formula,64
NA,that we can understand. Many people,64
NA,"will agree with i t , but unquestionably if",64
NA,involves the provision of some millions of,64
NA,pounds more than would be necessary had,64
NA,the formula which the Minister himself,64
NA,announced been applied.,64
Mr SCULLY ,Th e formula which,64
NA,was announced has been consistently,64
NA,adhered to.,64
NA,-,64
Mr MCEWEN , I t was not the,64
NA,formula that the Minister announced.,64
Mr SCULLY ," I t was, absolutely.",64
Mr MCEWEN , W a s i t the formula,64
NA,the Minister announced at,64
NA,attributed to Gunnedah i n July?,64
Mr SCULLY ,"Yes , and i t has never",64
NA,been departed from.,64
Mr MCEWEN , T h e n w i l l the Minis-,64
NA,ter explain the circumstances i n which,64
NA,memhe received a deputation f r o m the,64
NA,said Farmers and Settlers Association on the,64
NA,"17th September, protesting against the",64
NA,application of a formula which would,65
NA,merely take into account the total average,65
NA,of the pool ?,65
Mr SCULLY ,Incorrec t reports of the,65
NA,conversation which I had with that,65
NA,deputation were published in a section,65
NA,of the press. Mr Nock and Mr.,65
NA,Cambridge were satisfied with my,65
NA,explanation. I repudiated some of those,65
NA,press statements.,65
Mr MCEWEN ,M y purpose in rais-,65
NA,ing the matter this evening was to elicit,65
NA,"the policy of the Government, Am I",65
NA,correct in stating that the Minister has,65
NA,declared that the policy is that which was,65
NA,announced by the chairman of the Aus-,65
NA,tralian Wheat Board?,65
Mr SCULLY ,Yes .,65
Mr MCEWEN ,Th e chairman stated,65
NA,that the board had been informed by the,65
NA,Government that i t had decided to elimi-,65
NA,nate wheat sold for stock feed from the,65
NA,calculation of compensation to the wheat-,65
NA,growers having wheat in the No. 6 and,65
NA,No. 7 pools.,65
Mr SCULLY ,"That , is my intention",65
NA,and that information has been given,65
NA,whenever it has been sought.,65
Mr MCEWEN ,Le t me approach the,65
NA,matter from that stand-point. The,65
NA,formula is to eliminate wheat sold for,65
NA,stock feed so that we must strike an,65
NA,average by taking the wheat gristed for,65
NA,flour for human consumption in Aus-,65
NA,"tralia, and wheat used by power alcohol",65
NA,"distilleries, and breakfast food manufac-",65
NA,"turers, and for export. Unfortunately,",65
NA,the Minister has contradicted himself,65
NA,since then. I happened to look at a,65
NA,"reply to a question, which I can only",65
NA,describe as having been surreptitiously,65
NA,lodged. The question had been addressed,65
NA,to the Minister for Commerce and Agri-,65
NA,culture by the honorable member for,65
NA,Grey ( Mr Russell). The Minister indi-,65
NA,cated that he would reply to it later.,65
NA,"On the 8th March last, a reply was given",65
NA,in a manner unprecedented during my,65
NA,eleven years' experience in this chamber.,65
NA,A typewritten answer was handed to the,65
NA,Clerk of the House. I t was couched in,65
NA,"argumentative terms, and in the form",65
NA,"of a speech. I f I had not secured, the",65
NA,"answer, as I was entitled to do, I would",65
NA,not now probably have been aware of this,65
NA,latest contradiction by the Minister. The,65
NA,"honorable gentleman stated that last July,",65
NA,he informed delegates that i t was the,65
NA,intention of the Government to adjust,65
NA,the pool payments so that wheat sold for,65
NA,stock feed would be brought up to the,65
NA,average realizations of wheat sold for,65
NA,human consumption. Only two minutes,65
NA,ago the Minister declared that that was,65
NA,not the policy. He said that-the inten-,65
NA,tion is to bring the concessional price,65
NA,up to the average of wheat sold for human,65
NA,"consumption, to power alcohol distilleries",65
NA,"and breakfast food manufacturers, and",65
NA,for export. I desire to get at the truh.,65
Mr SCULLY , I tried to correct a mis-,65
NA,statement which the honorable member,65
NA,"has continually made, that the conces-",65
NA,sional sales would be taken into considera-,65
NA,tion in striking the average.,65
Mr MCEWEN , I do not desire to,65
NA,take fine points about the Minister accus-,65
NA,ing me of making a mistake. I have read,65
NA,his reply to a motion which I submitted,65
NA,on the 14th September. His remarks,65
NA,appear in Hansard. After full considera-,65
NA,"tion, he announced that the price of stock",65
NA,feed would be increased so as to bring it,65
NA,up to the return from the pools concerned.,65
NA,"Those words are clear. Yet, when I quoted",65
NA,them as the foundation for making cer-,65
NA,"tain calculations, the Minister accused me",65
NA,of misrepresenting him. [Extension of,65
NA,time granted.] The Government is en-,65
NA,titled to make its own decision on thiB,65
NA,"matter, and no doubt will do so if i t is",65
NA,"not "" pushed around"" too much. But",65
NA,"the wheat-growers, the public, and the",65
NA,taxpayers are entitled to an authoritative,65
NA,"statement, not a series of contradictory",65
NA,statements by the Minister and the chair-,65
NA,"man of the Australian Wheat Board,",65
NA,1,65
NA,culminating in the latest contradiction in,65
NA,the Minister's reply to a question asked,65
NA,by the honorable member for Grey. As I,65
NA,"stated, that reply was handed to the Clerk",65
NA,of the House in a manner which was cer-,65
NA,tainly not in conformity with procedure,65
NA,laid down in the Standing Orders. The,65
NA,"statement commenced, "" With the indul-",65
NA,"gence of the House"". I n the circum-",65
NA,stances mentioned the indulgence of the,65
NA,House could not be obtained. What,65
NA,"we desire to know, and this involves some",65
NA,millions of pounds to the Government,65
NA,"and the wheat-growers, is: On what",65
NA,"formula are the calculations to be based,",65
NA,to make an additional payment to the,65
NA,No. 6 and No. 7 pools on account of tht,66
NA,concessional wheat prices? I ask the,66
NA,Minister to make a clear statement.,66
Mr SCULLY ,Th e position has been,66
NA,"clearly stated repeatedly, and I am not",66
NA,prepared to make a further statement.,66
Mr MCEWEN , I defy a genius to,66
NA,"work out, from the series of statements",66
NA,"made by the Minister, exactly what the",66
NA,position is.,66
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,"""Barker)",66
NA,[10.49] -A t this hour I do not desire to,66
NA,provoke an argument on the refusal of,66
NA,the Prime Minister ( Mr Curtin) to,66
NA,answer questions which private members,66
NA,"may address to him without notice, and",66
NA,"my right to ask him, questions. I shall",66
NA,defer that until the right honorable gentle-,66
NA,man is here to answer my interrogations.,66
NA,[ never like to shoot a hare until he is,66
NA,having a run for his money. When the,66
NA,Prime Minister comes into the chamber,66
NA,I shall have something to say to him.,66
NA,"According to my information, certain",66
NA,departmental committees are now deter-,66
NA,mining the fate of the Northern Terri-,66
NA,tory for a generation to come. I t appears,66
NA,to me that every one has a finger in this,66
NA,"pie, with the exception of the residents of",66
NA,that area. One of the most amazing docu-,66
NA,ments that I have received came from the,66
NA,Minister for the Interior (Senator,66
NA,"Collings) quite recently. I n it, he said",66
NA,that he would not take any notice what-,66
NA,ever of the Northern Territory Develop-,66
NA,"ment League, which had been formed",66
NA,to handle affairs of interest to,66
NA,"the people of that territory, but that i f",66
NA,individual members oared to write to him,66
NA,iji their private capacity he would con-,66
NA,sider anything that might be put up.,66
NA,That is a little too bad. There are cer-,66
NA,tain very important features of develop-,66
NA,ment in the Northern Territory which,66
NA,will have to be undertaken in the near,66
NA,future. They concern the development,66
NA,"of stock routes, the making of roads, the",66
NA,"opening of ports, the question as to",66
NA,whether or not a railway line shall go,66
NA,"through and, if so, in what direction, the",66
NA,"conservation of water, the establishment",66
NA,"of certain irrigation areas, the encourage-",66
NA,"ment of mining, and quite a few other",66
NA,matters. The least which the people can,66
NA,expect from the Government is that those,66
NA,who are on the spot and have spent a,66
NA,prood part of their lives on these jobs shall,66
NA,have the opportunity of seeing the depart-,66
NA,mental heads who are supposed to pro-,66
NA,"duce the milennium in the territory, and",66
NA,shall at least he accorded the courtesy of,66
NA,being allowed to put their views before,66
NA,the people who are determining their,66
NA,future. They have no representation of,66
NA,their own. The only representative they,66
NA,"have is a member of this House, and he is",66
NA,not able to speak for them at present.,66
NA,"For the time being, I propose to put their",66
NA,case to the Government. I f I am not able,66
NA,to see for myself .some of the things which,66
NA,"the Government proposes to do, and to",66
NA,"indicate them to the people who matter,",66
NA,I shall have no recourse except to submit,66
NA,a substantive motion which will produce,66
NA,a debate on the future of the Northern,66
NA,Territory and what the Government pro-,66

NA,the hire rate for films is determined by,67

NA,PRISONERS OF WAR : QUESTIONNAIRES TO,68
NA,RELATIVES.,68
Mr DEDMAN , O n the 7th March the,68
NA,proof honorable member fo r Moreton ( Mr .,68
NA,Francis) referred to an article which had,68
NA,appeared i n Smith's Weekly on the 3rd,68
NA,"March, stating that questionnaires were",68
NA,are still being sent to the relatives of,68
NA,"the prisoners-of-war, and asked whether i t",68
NA,was a fact that I had stated some weeks,68
NA,ago that these questionnaires would not,68
NA,"issued and, further, whether I would",68
NA,to now direct that the practice should be,68
NA,discontinued.,68
NA,I n reply I advise the honorable member,68
NA,and that on the 27th January last a press,68
NA,statement was issued by me on this sub-,68
NA,"the ject, stating that the questionnaire to",68
NA,with relatives of prisoners-of-war should be,68
NA,"completed i n the interests of the soldier,",68
NA,and I then made i t clear that the ques-,68
NA,qualifitionnaire was being forwarded by the,68
NA,department to non-dependent allottees,68
NA,only of prisoners-of-war. I t is now re-,69
NA,iterated that the action that has been,69
NA,"taken is entirely in the soldiers' interests,",69
NA,"and not, as has been stated in this House",69
NA,"and elsewhere, with a view to saving",69
NA,money at the expense of the soldier,69
NA,prisoner-of-war and his relatives. The,69
NA,Government is completely sympathetic,69
NA,both to the prisoners-of-war and their,69
NA,"relatives, and has not the slightest wish to",69
NA,impose any hardship or effect any,69
NA,monetary saving at their expense.,69
NA,"However, in view of the experience",69
NA,gained both in the last war and the,69
NA,"present war, when many cases occurred",69
NA,in which non-dependent allottees did not,69
NA,apply the allotment moneys received by,69
NA,"them as the soldier had intended, it was",69
NA,considered advisable that in the case of,69
NA,prisoners-of-war who had been in the,69
NA,hands of the enemy for a lengthy period,69
NA,and wei-e thus not in a position to ascer-,69
NA,tain in what manner the allotment that,69
NA,they had made to a non-dependant was,69
NA,"being utilized, questionnaires should be",69
NA,despatched to non-dependent allottees. At,69
NA,the time the questionnaire was despatched,69
NA,it was accompanied by the following,69
NA,memorandum:-,69
NA,The enclosed questionnaire is being,69
NA,warded for completion by all allottees of,69
NA,"soldiers wlio are prisoners of war, and who",69
NA,"not in receipt of dependants allowance, and",69
NA,"who, therefore, as far as the department",69
NA,"aware, are not dependent upon the soldiers",69
NA,concerned.,69
NA,The soldier is unfortunately not in,69
NA,tion to satisfy himself that the allotment is,69
NA,being applied to any purpose for which,69
NA,have intended at tlie time of making the allot-,69
NA,ment. The circumstances may also have,69
NA,changed to such an extent that if the soldier,69
NA,were available to be consulted he might re-,69
NA,quest cancellation or reduction of the allot-,69
NA,ment. I t is therefore the desire of,69
NA,ment to protect the interests of the soldier in,69
NA,his absence.,69
NA,The information that has been obtained,69
NA,"as a result, of the despatch of this ques-",69
NA,tionnaire indicates to me that its despatch,69
NA,"was justified. I n the majority of cases,",69
NA,"however, there has been no cause to make",69
NA,any change in the allotment; but where,69
NA,an allotment has been cancelled as a,69
NA,result of the information which has been,69
NA,"disclosed, the amount of allotment so can-",69
NA,celled is being credited to the soldier and,69
NA,will be drawn by him on his return to,69
NA,Australia. I t is thus in the soldiers',69
NA,interest in such cases that the allotment,69
NA,should have been cancelled and that the,69
NA,questionnaire should have been de-,69
NA,spatched. Exception has also been taken,69
NA,both in this House and elsewhere to the,69
NA,despatch of a similar form of question-,69
NA,naire to the non-dependent allottees of,69
NA,members of the forces who are reported,69
NA,"as ""missing"" as a result of active opera-",69
NA,"tions. The regulations provide that, in",69
NA,"such cases, an allotment to a non-",69
NA,dependant will cease after a certain,69
NA,period from the date on which the soldier,69
NA,"concerned is reported to be missing. ""When",69
NA,it is disclosed as a result of the replies to,69
NA,the questionnaire that hardship would,69
NA,"arise by the suspension of the allotment,",69
NA,payment is continued at a rate commen-,69
NA,"surate with the circumstances. I t is,",69
NA,"therefore, in the interests of non-",69
NA,dependent allottees that the questionnaire,69
NA,received by them should be completed. I f,69
NA,it is not completed the allotment will,69
NA,automatically cease after a certain period.,69
NA,"Cases have occurred in which, as the",69
NA,"result of answers to the questions, pay-",69
NA,ment of dependants' allowance has been,69
NA,authorized in addition to the allotment.,69
NA,"In the circumstances outlined above, it",69
NA,is not proposed to issue directions that,69
NA,forthe questionnaire to which exception has,69
NA,been taken should be discontinued. I t,69
NA,are should be appreciated by all concerned,69
NA,is that the questionnaire is not despatched,69
NA,in any circumstances to allottees who,69
NA,are dependent on the member and are in,69
NA,a posireceipt of dependants' allowance in,69

NA,"notice, concerning the requirements of",69
NA,Tasmania in regard to superphosphate.,69
NA,"I have now looked into the matter, and",69
NA,can inform the honorable member that it,69
NA,is known that all pastures in Australia,69
NA,normally requiring superphosphate are,69
NA,showing the effects of phosphate shortage.,69
NA,"During the last two years, it has been",69
NA,possible to make some improvement in,69
NA,the condition of irrigated and dairying,69
NA,pastures by means Of increased dressings,69
NA,"of superphosphate, but the overall supply",69
NA,position has not yet improved sufficiently,69
NA,to permit special allocations for other,69
NA,types of pastures. Allocations to indi-,70
NA,vidual States are based on. a crop,70
NA,priority plan approved by tbe Australian,70
NA,Agricultural Council. Tbe Tasmanian,70
NA,"allocation of superphosphate for 194.4-4,5",70
NA,"was made in accordance with this plan,",70
NA,and in common with the other States the,70
NA,"requirements of pastures, other than for",70
NA,"irrigated and dairying pastures, have had",70
NA,to be met out of what is known as the,70
NA,""" other crops quota "". The distribution",70
NA,"of the "" other crops quota"" among",70
NA,"specific non-priority crops, in any par-",70
NA,"ticular State, is a matter for determina-",70
NA,tion by the State Department of,70
NA,Agriculture. Whilst the disabilities men-,70
NA,tioned by the honorable member are fully,70
NA,"and sympathetically appreciated, i t is re-",70
NA,gretted that the position cannot be,70
NA,improved until the world supply of phos-,70
NA,phate permits a larger allocation to Aus-,70
NA,tralia. The honorable member may rest,70
NA,assured that the Government is doing,70
NA,everything possible to press Australia's,70
NA,claims overseas for additional supplies.,70

NA,2. Is there any likelihood of a substantial,70
NA,reduction being made in tlie cost of penicillin,70

Mr HOLLOWAY ,Th e Minister for,70
NA,Health has supplied the following,70
NA,answers:-,70
NA,"1. The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories,",70
NA,"at whicli penicillin is manufactured, is a",70
NA,Commonwealth Government establishment,70
NA,working on a strictly business basis. The,70
NA,Commonwealth Government cannot undertake,70

NA,tenance of maternity and public hospitals is a,70
NA,"function of State Governments, the Common-",70
NA,wealth Government having no responsibility i n,70

NA,2. Is i t a fact that the increase in 1944 over,70

NA,to the .extension of open-cut methods in the,70

NA,1. Determinations of the Public Service,71
NA,Arbitrator apply only to members of claimant',71
NA,organizations and the wording of the deter-,71

NA,3. Iu the reasons accompanying Determina-,71

NA,words referred to and presumably i t must,71
NA,bo accepted that the rates lie fixed were,71

NA,This bill implements key elements of the,17

NA,The pension reform measures in this bill,17

NA,"aged-care laws. A further bill, to be intro-",17
NA,"duced at a later date, will deliver the pension",17
NA,reform measures for veterans and their de-,17
NA,pendants.,17
NA,"Most of the pension reforms, including the",17
NA,"important pension increases, will be intro-",17
NA,duced from 20 September 2009. Other meas-,17
NA,ures will commence on the dates as speci-,17
NA,fied.,17
NA,Increased pension payments,18
NA,"From 20 September 2009, the secure and",18
NA,sustainable pension reforms will deliver total,18
NA,increases of $32.49 a week for singles who,18
NA,"receive the maximum rate of pension, and",18
NA,$10.14 a week combined for couples on the,18
NA,maximum rate.,18
NA,These increases are on top of regular in-,18
NA,dexation due in September. The total in-,18
NA,crease will comprise a rise in the base rate,18
NA,"for single pensioners and a new, and in-",18
NA,"creased, pension supplement for all pension-",18
NA,ers. This increase brings the single rate of,18
NA,pension up to two-thirds of the combined,18
NA,couple rate.,18
NA,The maximum base rate of the pension,18
NA,payable to single people will be increased by,18
NA,"$30 a week. In addition, singles will receive",18
NA,an increase of $2.49 a week in the new pen-,18
NA,"sion supplement, bringing their total increase",18
NA,to $32.49 a week. The $10.14 a week in-,18
NA,crease for couples combined will be pro-,18
NA,vided through the new pension supplement.,18
NA,These increases are on top of all existing,18
NA,pensions and allowances.,18
NA,"Following these reforms, the new total",18
NA,weekly pension plus supplement will be an,18
NA,estimated $336.68 for singles and $507.50,18
NA,for couples combined. This amounts to,18
NA,"$17,507.36 a year for singles, and",18
NA,"$26,390.00 for couples combined. The actual",18
NA,figures to apply from 20 September will de-,18
NA,pend on indexation. Actual cost of living,18
NA,increases and wages figures are not yet,18
NA,available.,18
NA,New indexation and benchmarking,18
NA,arrangements,18
NA,New indexation arrangements will be in-,18
NA,troduced to better reflect cost of living in-,18
NA,creases for pensioners. As part of the gov-,18
NA,"ernment's reform package, a new pensioner",18
NA,and beneficiary living cost index will be cal-,18
NA,culated by the Australian Bureau of Statis-,18
NA,tics. This new index will measure increases,18
NA,in the living costs faced by pensioner and,18
NA,"beneficiary households, which can be differ-",18
NA,ent to those faced by other households.,18
NA,The new living cost index will be more re-,18
NA,sponsive to changes experienced by pen-,18
NA,sioner households where the living costs may,18
NA,have moved faster than the rate of changes,18
NA,measured by the consumer price index for,18
NA,the living costs of all households. From 20,18
NA,"September 2009, the maximum base rate of",18
NA,relevant social security and veterans pen-,18
NA,sions will be adjusted in line with either the,18
NA,the consumer price index or the new pensioner,18
NA,"and beneficiary living cost index, whichever",18
NA,is the higher.,18
NA,Pension rates will also continue to be,18
NA,benchmarked to male total average weekly,18
NA,earnings.,18
NA,"From 20 March 2010, a new pension",18
NA,benchmark for the maximum combined cou-,18
NA,ple rate of pension will be introduced. It will,18
NA,be 41.76 per cent of the annualised amount,18
NA,of male total average weekly earnings.,18
NA,For a person being paid a single rate of,18
NA,"pension, the maximum rate payable to that",18
NA,person will be set at 66.33 per cent of the,18
NA,maximum rate payable to a combined cou-,18
NA,"ple. Therefore, the new benchmark for the",18
NA,maximum single rate of pension will be 27.7,18
NA,per cent of male total average weekly earn-,18
NA,"ings, an increase of more than 10 per cent",18
NA,from the current 25 per cent benchmark.,18
NA,Current arrangements will continue to ap-,18
NA,ply for parenting payment (single) and for,18
NA,the disability support pension paid to people,18
NA,under age 21 without children.,18
NA,New pension and seniors supplements,18
NA,The range of supplementary payments and,18
NA,allowances currently paid to pensioners will,18
NA,be simplified and made more flexible,18
NA,through the introduction of a new pension,18
NA,supplement.,18
NA,This will help make pension payments,19
NA,"easier to understand. Following the reforms,",19
NA,pensioners will receive two main payments:,19
NA,the base pension and the pension supple-,19
NA,ment.,19
NA,This new pension supplement incorporates,19
NA,"the value of the existing GST supplement,",19
NA,"pharmaceutical allowance, utilities allow-",19
NA,ance and telephone allowance (at the higher,19
NA,internet rate). Increases of $2.49 a week for,19
NA,singles and $10.14 a week for couples com-,19
NA,bined will be paid on top of the value of ex-,19
NA,isting allowances.,19
NA,The pension supplement will be indexed,19
NA,in March and September each year in line,19
NA,with increases in the consumer price index.,19
NA,will be available only to people resident in,19
NA,Australia or temporarily overseas.,19
NA,The pension supplement for a single pen-,19
NA,"sioner will be around two-thirds, 66.33 per",19
NA,"cent, of the pension supplement for a couple",19
NA,combined. This mirrors the new single to,19
NA,couple ratio established for pension rates.,19
NA,"At 20 September 2009, it is estimated the",19
NA,pension supplement will be worth up to,19
NA,"$1,462.70 a year for singles (or $28.13 a",19
NA,"week) and $2,199.60 a year for couples (or",19
NA,$42.30 a week). This is an estimate as the,19
NA,actual indexation increase is not yet known.,19
NA,The pension supplement will be included,19
NA,in the pension payment rate and subject to,19
NA,"income and assets testing. This means that,",19
NA,"once the base pension rate is reduced to nil,",19
NA,the pension supplement will decrease until it,19
NA,reaches a minimum payment of an estimated,19
NA,$790.40 a year for singles (or $15.20 a week),19
NA,"and $1,190.80 a year for couples (or $22.90 a",19
NA,week). The payment a person receives will,19
NA,not fall below the minimum amount of the,19
NA,pension supplement until the person's in-,19
NA,come or assets reach a level that would oth-,19
NA,erwise reduce their payment to nil.,19
NA,The new pension supplement will provide,19
NA,pensioners with more flexibility in managing,19
NA,their own budgets.,19
NA,"From 20 September 2009, the pension",19
NA,"supplement will be paid fortnightly, along",19
NA,"with the base pension. From July 2010, pen-",19
NA,sioners will have the choice of receiving,19
NA,around half of the pension supplement in,19
NA,quarterly instalments. This flexible part of,19
NA,the pension supplement will be equal to the,19
NA,minimum payment of pension supplement.,19
NA,Self-funded retirees will also benefit from,19
NA,these reforms. A new seniors supplement for,19
NA,holders of a Commonwealth seniors health,19
NA,card will be introduced from 20 September,19
NA,It 2009. The seniors supplement will replace,19
NA,the seniors concession allowance and tele-,19
NA,phone allowance (at the higher internet rate),19
NA,for eligible recipients. The seniors supple-,19
NA,ment will continue to be available as a quar-,19
NA,terly payment and will be paid at the same,19
NA,rate as the minimum amount of the pension,19
NA,supplement. The seniors supplement for a,19
NA,single person will be 66.33 per cent of the,19
NA,seniors supplement for a couple combined.,19
NA,"In September 2009, the seniors supplement",19
NA,will be an estimated $790.40 a year for sin-,19
NA,"gles and $1,190.80 a year for couples.",19
NA,Increases in the pension supplement,19
NA,minimum amount for couples combined and,19
NA,for singles will flow through to increases in,19
NA,the seniors supplement. This will mean pen-,19
NA,sioners cannot receive less supplement than,19
NA,eligible self-funded retirees.,19
NA,Change to the pension income test,19
NA,As part of the secure and sustainable pen-,19
NA,"sion reform package, the pension income test",19
NA,will be tightened. This will help ensure the,19
NA,pension system is sustainable in the longer,19
NA,"term, and that increases can be targeted to",19
NA,those most in need. These changes apply to,19
NA,"recipients of social security age pension, dis-",19
NA,"ability support pension, wife pension, carer",19
NA,"payment, widow B pension, bereavement",19
NA,allowance and special needs pension. This,20
NA,change does not apply to recipients of par-,20
NA,enting payment (single).,20
NA,"From 20 September 2009, the pension in-",20
NA,come test taper rate will increase from 40c,20
NA,50c for each dollar of income over the in-,20
NA,"come test free area. Under the new rules,",20
NA,where a pensioner has ordinary income over,20
NA,"the income test free area, their rate of pen-",20
NA,sion will reduce by 50c for each dollar of,20
NA,income above the free area. In the case of a,20
NA,"pensioner couple, their combined pension",20
NA,will reduce by 50c for each dollar of income,20
NA,(combined) over the income test free area.,20
NA,Pensions paid to each partner will reduce by,20
NA,"25c for each dollar of income (couple, com-",20
NA,bined) over the income test free area.,20
NA,To bring the pension income test into line,20
NA,"with other means-tested payments, including",20
NA,"allowances and family assistance, the addi-",20
NA,tional income test ‘free area' for dependent,20
NA,children will be removed.,20
NA,Transitional arrangements will be put in,20
NA,place to protect existing pensioners who,20
NA,would otherwise have faced a payment re-,20
NA,duction because of the changes to the income,20
NA,test. The transitional safety net will ensure,20
NA,that current payment rates for part-rate pen-,20
NA,"sioners are maintained in real terms, with",20
NA,indexation in line with increases in the con-,20
NA,"sumer price index, and that they benefit from",20
NA,an increase of $10.14 per week for singles or,20
NA,couples combined. They will continue to,20
NA,"receive these existing entitlements, including",20
NA,"the increase, until they are better off under",20
NA,"the new pension rules, including the new 50c",20
NA,income test withdrawal rate.,20
NA,New ‘work bonus',20
NA,Some pensioners choose to take up paid,20
NA,work to supplement their pension. A new,20
NA,work bonus will be introduced to help age,20
NA,pensioners keep more of the money they earn,20
NA,from work. The work bonus will provide,20
NA,concessional treatment of employment in-,20
NA,come under the income test for pensioners,20
NA,over age pension age.,20
NA,"Under these new rules, employment in-",20
NA,come will be assessed fortnightly for pen-,20
NA,to sioners over age pension age. Only half of all,20
NA,employment income (up to a maximum of,20
NA,$500 a fortnight) will be assessed in the in-,20
NA,come test.,20
NA,"For example, a single age pensioner who",20
NA,works part time with a fortnightly income of,20
NA,"$500 will have only half of their income, or",20
NA,"$250, from this job assessed under the pen-",20
NA,sion income test. This means that the pen-,20
NA,sioner will be up to $125 per fortnight better,20
NA,"off just as a result of the new work bonus,",20
NA,even after taking into account the tightening,20
NA,of pension income test rules.,20
NA,Further amendments in the bill are made,20
NA,to close the Pension Bonus Scheme. The in-,20
NA,troduction of the scheme in July 1998 was,20
NA,intended to encourage older Australians who,20
NA,would otherwise retire and claim age pension,20
NA,to remain in the workforce and defer claim-,20
NA,ing the payment. The Harmer pension review,20
NA,found the scheme is not meeting its objective,20
NA,of encouraging workforce participation,20
NA,"among older Australians. As a result, it will",20
NA,be closed to new entrants from 20 September,20
NA,2009. Existing members of the scheme will,20
NA,be able to remain in the scheme and claim a,20
NA,pension and their bonus when they finish,20
NA,working.,20
NA,Age pension age,20
NA,"As part of these reforms, and to improve",20
NA,the longer term sustainability of the pension,20
NA,"system, the qualifying age for age pension",20
NA,will increase for both men and women from,20
NA,65 to 67 years. This will be done on a grad-,20
NA,"ual basis, with the qualifying age for age",20
NA,pension increasing by six months every two,20
NA,"years, commencing on 1 July 2017 and will",20
NA,be fully implemented on 1 July 2023. Phas-,20
NA,ing the change in over this period will allow,20
NA,affected individuals time to plan for their,21
NA,retirement.,21
NA,The change will ensure age pension age is,21
NA,adjusted to reflect the significant improve-,21
NA,ments in life expectancy that have occurred,21
NA,since the age pension was first introduced in,21
NA,1909. It will allow the government to re-,21
NA,spond to the long-term cost of our demo-,21
NA,graphic challenges. This change will not im-,21
NA,"pact on current age pensioners, and will only their fees.",21
NA,affect people born on or after 1 July 1952.,21
NA,The phase-in of the increased age mirrors the,21
NA,rate of increase of the pension age for,21
NA,"women, which is currently increasing and",21
NA,will reach 65 years on 1 July 2013.,21
NA,The pension age for veterans will not be,21
NA,increasing as a result of these changes. The,21
NA,male veteran age will remain at 60 years.,21
NA,Pension age for female veterans is currently,21
NA,58½ years and is gradually increasing to,21
NA,align with male veteran pension age of 60 by,21
NA,"2013. However, the pension age for nonvet-",21
NA,erans under the Veterans' Entitlements Act,21
NA,will increase in the same manner as the,21
NA,qualifying age for age pension under the So-,21
NA,cial Security Act.,21
NA,More flexible advance arrangements,21
NA,Existing arrangements for advance pay-,21
NA,"ments will be improved, to give pensioners",21
NA,greater access to advances of certain social,21
NA,security payments. Advance payments are,21
NA,lump sum prepayments of a pensioner's enti-,21
NA,"tlements, which are repaid in instalments",21
NA,from future pension payments. The im-,21
NA,provements will increase the maximum al-,21
NA,"lowable advance from $500 to around $1,000",21
NA,"for singles and $1,500 for couples combined.",21
NA,The actual maximum advance amounts will,21
NA,be linked to movements in social security,21
NA,pension rates. They will also enable pension-,21
NA,ers to access more than one advance in any,21
NA,12-month period. The changes will modern-,21
NA,ise the advance payment system to better,21
NA,"reflect the needs of pensioners, helping them",21
NA,meet large or unexpected expenses.,21
NA,Pension reform implications for aged care,21
NA,"As our population ages, it is vital that we",21
NA,support a strong residential aged-care sector,21
NA,that provides appropriate care for frail older,21
NA,Australians. It is also important that those,21
NA,older Australians who reside in aged-care,21
NA,facilities have some money left after paying,21
NA,The government has decided to share the,21
NA,pension increase between aged-care provid-,21
NA,ers and pensioners. This ensures that pen-,21
NA,sioners in aged-care homes are able to bene-,21
NA,"fit from the pension increase, while at the",21
NA,same time recognising that care providers,21
NA,also need additional funding to contribute to,21
NA,"the costs of services such as nursing care,",21
NA,food and cleaning.,21
NA,"Of the pension increase for singles, $10.09",21
NA,per week will flow to the pensioner and,21
NA,$22.40 per week will flow to the residential,21
NA,aged care provider through an increase to the,21
NA,basic daily fee.,21
NA,As the daily fee charged to self-funded re-,21
NA,tirees is linked to the amount of the age pen-,21
NA,"sion, an increase in the age pension would",21
NA,normally mean the fees faced by self-funded,21
NA,retirees would increase.,21
NA,The government recognises that a sudden,21
NA,cost increase for existing self-funded retiree,21
NA,"residents would be an unfair burden, and has",21
NA,decided that those self-funded retirees in,21
NA,residential aged care on 19 September 2009,21
NA,will have their existing fee levels protected,21
NA,until they leave. Those who enter aged care,21
NA,after this date will have any cost increase,21
NA,phased in over four years.,21
NA,The arrangements for self-funded retirees,21
NA,will also apply to part-rate pensioners who,21
NA,do not benefit from the pension increase.,21
NA,"During this period, aged-care providers",21
NA,"will be compensated by the government,",21
NA,"through a new top-up supplement, for any",22
NA,difference between the actual fee paid by,22
NA,these new part-rate pensioners who may not,22
NA,receive the full pension increase and by self-,22
NA,funded retirees and the new standard basic,22
NA,"daily fee-that is, the difference between the",22
NA,phased rate and the standard rate.,22
NA,A combination of increased fees paid by,22
NA,residents and the new top-up supplement,22
NA,represents an increase of $713.2 million over,22
NA,four years for the aged-care sector. This will,22
NA,be available to meet the rising costs that,22
NA,"aged-care providers face. At the same time,",22
NA,pensioners will have extra money to meet,22
NA,their out-of-pocket expenses.,22
NA,Changes to family payment indexation,22
NA,The government is taking important steps,22
NA,to reform family payments to make them,22
NA,more sustainable for the long term. As part of,22
NA,"these changes, from 1 July 2009 under provi-",22
NA,"sions of this bill, the maximum rates of fam-",22
NA,ily tax benefit part A will only be indexed in,22
NA,accordance with movements in the consumer,22
NA,price index. For rates of payment for chil-,22
NA,"dren under 16 years, current benchmarks to",22
NA,the combined pensioner couple rate (which,22
NA,enable benchmarking to male total average,22
NA,weekly earnings) will be removed.,22
NA,The removal of the link to earnings en-,22
NA,sures that government expenditure on family,22
NA,assistance is more sustainable in the long,22
NA,term. The indexation of maximum payment,22
NA,rates in accordance with movements in the,22
NA,consumer price index will continue to main-,22
NA,tain the real value of assistance for families,22
NA,on low and moderate incomes. In a tight fis-,22
NA,"cal environment, savings from reduced ex-",22
NA,penditure on family tax benefit can be di-,22
NA,"rected to funding other priorities, such as",22
NA,secure and sustainable pension reforms. Aus-,22
NA,tralia's spending on family payments is gen-,22
NA,erous by international standards. The most,22
NA,recent analysis shows our spending on cash,22
NA,family benefits was equal third highest in the,22
NA,"OECD, at 2.2 per cent of GDP, well above",22
NA,the average of 1.3 per cent.,22
NA,The indexation date for the maternity im-,22
NA,munisation allowance will be changed from,22
NA,twice a year to once a year. In line with other,22
NA,"family payments, the maternity immunisa-",22
NA,tion allowance will now be indexed on 1,22
NA,July. The first annual indexation will occur,22
NA,on 1 July 2010.,22
NA,Other measures,22
NA,Recipients of social security and veterans,22
NA,"entitlements payments, who receive pay-",22
NA,ments under certain Western Australian pro-,22
NA,"grams, will have these amounts excluded",22
NA,from the income test for the purposes of cal-,22
NA,culating their rate of payment. The Western,22
NA,Australian programs are the Cost of Living,22
NA,Rebate Scheme and the Country Age Pension,22
NA,Fuel Card. The income test concession will,22
NA,start on 1 July 2009 and end on 30 June,22
NA,2012.,22
NA,The bill also includes amendments relat-,22
NA,ing to the adjusted taxable income test for,22
NA,"the Commonwealth seniors health card,",22
NA,whether issued under the Social Security Act,22
NA,or the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The,22
NA,amendments will include in adjusted taxable,22
NA,income any reportable superannuation con-,22
NA,"tributions, including income salary sacrificed",22
NA,to superannuation. These amendments are,22
NA,relocated from the Social Security and Veter-,22
NA,ans' Entitlements Amendment (Common-,22
NA,"wealth Seniors Health Card) Bill 2009, cur-",22
NA,"rently before the parliament, but which will",22
NA,be withdrawn. The measure is consistent,22
NA,with changes that have been legislated in,22
NA,respect of a range of pension and allowance,22
NA,"income tests, and arrangements that have",22
NA,the existed for the age pension for some time.,22
NA,To better support pensioners who are,22
NA,"studying to improve their qualifications, the",22
NA,portability conditions for full-time students,22
NA,on Austudy and youth allowance will be ex-,22
NA,tended to other income support payments.,22
NA,This will apply to a person receiving disabil-,23
NA,"ity support pension, parenting payment, carer",23
NA,"payment, widow B pension, wife pension,",23
NA,partner allowance or widow allowance. If the,23
NA,person is in full-time study and continues to,23
NA,meet the qualification conditions for their,23
NA,"payment, they will be entitled to go overseas",23
NA,for more than 13 weeks to study as part of,23
NA,their full-time Australian course.,23
NA,The bill will also amend schedule 2 to the,23
NA,Veterans' Entitlements Act to include a new,23
NA,operational area. This will give Defence,23
NA,Force members allotted for duty in the new,23
NA,operational area during the relevant dates,23
NA,access to pensions and benefits available,23
NA,under the Veterans' Entitlements Act.,23
NA,Conclusion,23
NA,This government has acted to introduce,23
NA,long-overdue reforms to significantly im-,23
NA,prove the adequacy of the pension and to,23
NA,make the pension system simpler and fairer.,23
NA,Reforms to provide long-term security and,23
NA,"certainty, and to ensure that, over time, the",23
NA,pension system remains both adequate and,23
NA,sustainable.,23
NA,Reforms which tackle the reality of the,23
NA,ageing population and the challenges this,23
NA,presents.,23

Mr NEUMANN ,Blair) (12.27 pm)-,23
NA,When I left off my speech on the Interna-,23
NA,tional Monetary Agreements Amendment,23
NA,(Financial Assistance) Bill 2009 a week or so,23
NA,"ago, I was saying that our relationship with",23
NA,Indonesia is of crucial importance to Austra-,23
NA,lia's economic development and prosperity.,23
NA,In our region we are a neighbour to Indone-,23
NA,sia. They partner with us in all kinds of ar-,23
NA,"eas, not just in sport and culture but also in",23
NA,terms of tackling the challenges of climate,23
NA,"change and education. There are 15,000 stu-",23
NA,dents from Indonesia alone studying here in,23
NA,Australia. That brings close to A$500 million,23
NA,into our economy each year. That is an,23
NA,"enormous amount of money, contributed by",23
NA,"Indonesian families to this economy, helping",23
NA,"our prosperity, our economic development",23
NA,and our wealth in this country. So the impor-,23
NA,tance of our relationship with Indonesia can-,23
NA,not be underestimated.,23
NA,We have committed $462 million over the,23
NA,2008-09 year in official assistance to Indone-,23
NA,sia. There have been many visits by senior,23
NA,"cabinet ministers, including the Prime Minis-",23
NA,"ter, to Indonesia and other parts of South-",23
NA,East Asia to show how important our rela-,23
NA,tions with the region are. Lest it be said that,23
NA,we are doing something unusual in terms of,23
NA,partnering with the World Bank and other,23
NA,countries to provide this sort of facility-,23
NA,US$1 billion to Indonesia as a standby,23
NA,loan-and lest it be said that charity begins,23
NA,at home and somehow we should not be do-,23
NA,"ing this, I say it is extremely important to",23
NA,show that we are a good neighbour to Indo-,23
NA,nesia and to build on the many ties that we,24
NA,have with Indonesia.,24
NA,In 1989 the Australia-Indonesia Institute,24
NA,was established by the Australian govern-,24
NA,ment. Its aim was to develop relations be-,24
NA,tween Australia and Indonesia and to pro-,24
NA,mote greater mutual understanding and ex-,24
NA,"panded areas of contact, and we have had",24
NA,Indonesian students under the program,24
NA,"studying here in Australia, for example. Mr",24
NA,"Speaker, you and I had the privilege of being",24
NA,there on the 20th anniversary when the Aus-,24
NA,tralian ambassador hosted the conference.,24
NA,"The goodwill, the amity and the friendship",24
NA,that was there between Australia and Indone-,24
NA,sia was quite evident and we must do every-,24
NA,thing we possibly can to continue to improve,24
NA,the relationship.,24
NA,Our bilateral economic and trade relation-,24
NA,ship with Indonesia is extremely important.,24
NA,Indonesia was Australia's 13th largest mer-,24
NA,"chandising trading partner in 2007, the 11th",24
NA,largest export market and the 11th largest,24
NA,source of imports. Our main merchandising,24
NA,"exports to Indonesia are, of course, wheat,",24
NA,"crude petroleum, live animals, aluminium",24
NA,and sugar. Our major imports from Indonesia,24
NA,"are crude petroleum, gas pumps, non-",24
NA,monetary gold and simply worked wood. So,24
NA,it is important for us to acknowledge how,24
NA,vital Indonesia's relationship is with Austra-,24
NA,lia. Our two-way merchandise trade totalled,24
NA,$8.8 billion in 2007. Exports were valued at,24
NA,$3.9 billion and imports at $4.8 billion. Aus-,24
NA,tralia was Indonesia's eighth largest export,24
NA,destination and ninth largest source of im-,24
NA,ports. So the relationship in terms of goods,24
NA,"important, providing assistance to Indonesia",24
NA,to ensure that the impacts of the global fi-,24
NA,nancial crisis and the global recession are,24
NA,lessened on that country. Our two-way ser-,24
NA,vices trade in Indonesia exceeded $1.6 bil-,24
NA,lion in 2007. We are providing assistance in,24
NA,terms of education related travel and per-,24
NA,sonal travel. Our major imports from Indone-,24
NA,sia in terms of services were personal travel,24
NA,and transportation as well. So our relation-,24
NA,ship with Indonesia is simply vital for our,24
NA,economic security as well as our prosperity.,24
NA,But what we are doing in terms of assis-,24
NA,tance for education is simply vital also. In,24
NA,the education sector strategic planning has,24
NA,been undertaken by Indonesia. The Indone-,24
NA,sian people set a goal to ensure that all Indo-,24
NA,nesian children receive a minimum nine-year,24
NA,primary and junior secondary education.,24
NA,That is so important in increasing the pros-,24
NA,perity and productivity of the Indonesian,24
NA,people and ensuring that Indonesian children,24
NA,have a better chance in life. We are partner-,24
NA,ing with Indonesia in our Australia-Indonesia,24
NA,Basic Education Program. That has an aspi-,24
NA,"ration to ensure that there are 2,000",24
NA,"schools-1,500 general and 500 madrasa",24
NA,"schools-constructed to create 330,000 new",24
NA,junior secondary school places for 13to 15-,24
NA,year-old Indonesian children. We are financ-,24
NA,ing through that program Indonesian schools,24
NA,and constructing them in consultation with,24
NA,local communities. It is important from the,24
NA,point of view of giving those children a,24
NA,chance in life. I have been to rural Central,24
NA,Kalimantan and to see the delight on the,24
NA,children's faces when they have new facili-,24
NA,ties there is simply a wonderful experience to,24
NA,"enjoy, and to realise that our dollars sent to",24
NA,this place and the work that we do in Indone-,24
NA,sia are very important in creating a great deal,24
NA,of goodwill towards Australia as well is most,24
NA,rewarding.,24
NA,Our partnership with Indonesia just does,24
NA,is not go to lending money and helping in,24
NA,terms of education. It also goes to tackling,24
NA,the challenge of climate change. We have,24
NA,engaged with Indonesia in the Kalimantan,24
NA,forest in a climate partnership. Our govern-,24
NA,ments have announced that we will help In-,24
NA,donesia in this regard. That was done at,24
NA,APEC in 2007 by the previous government.,24
NA,We have committed $30 million to the part-,24
NA,nership and we hope to attract an additional,25
NA,$70 million over time with other partners.,25
NA,We are trying to work with other partners to,25
NA,ensure that the Peatland Project in Central,25
NA,Kalimantan is also dealt with in such a way,25
NA,as to conserve the environment there and the,25
NA,wetlands because they are just so important,25
NA,for orangutans and other fauna and flora. We,25
NA,are partnering with the World Wide Fund for,25
NA,Nature and the BOS Foundation as well as,25
NA,universities in rural Kalimantan. The largest,25
NA,source of greenhouse gas emissions in Indo-,25
NA,"nesia is deforestation, estimated at 80 per",25
NA,cent of national greenhouse gas emissions.,25
NA,"Our partnership, the Indonesia-Australia",25
NA,"Forest Carbon Partnership, is key to ensuring",25
NA,that we can tackle this problem and deal with,25
NA,this issue in a global way.,25
NA,What we are doing with Indonesia does,25
NA,not go just to education or climate change or,25
NA,cultural and interfaith assistance; we are also,25
NA,"helping Indonesia in many ways, and not just",25
NA,in our trade but in other ways as well. We are,25
NA,"partnering with them for national security,",25
NA,confronting the problem of people-,25
NA,smuggling and dealing with them through,25
NA,"Australian Federal Police, who have a pres-",25
NA,"ence in Indonesia, tackling the problems of",25
NA,terrorism. We have seen over 200 terrorists,25
NA,"prosecuted and convicted by the Indonesians,",25
NA,and the government's initiatives are to be,25
NA,commended with respect to tackling the,25
NA,problem of terrorism. We have seen that in,25
NA,Bali and we have seen it on so many other,25
NA,occasions. Our own embassy has been at-,25
NA,tacked over there in Jakarta in Indonesia.,25
NA,So our relationship with Indonesia is cru-,25
NA,"cial for our economic development, our na-",25
NA,tional security and in terms of being a good,25
NA,"neighbour. In these circumstances this loan,",25
NA,"which I note has bipartisan support, should",25
NA,be carried out and we can show just what,25
NA,good neighbours we are with Indonesia. We,25
NA,should also promote the kind of assistance,25
NA,"that is crucial to cultural, sporting activities",25
NA,and other help. The legislation before the,25
NA,House does have bipartisan support. I note,25
NA,the comments made by the member for,25
NA,North Sydney in respect of this matter. He,25
NA,was quite equivocal and quite critical of the,25
NA,government in many ways in relation to this,25
NA,"legislation, but, despite his criticism of the",25
NA,"Rudd Labor government, the coalition will",25
NA,"support this legislation, and I commend it to",25
NA,the House.,25
Mr BOWEN ,Prospect-Minister for Fi-,25
NA,"nancial Services, Superannuation and Corpo-",25
NA,rate Law and Minister for Human Services),25
NA,(12.36 pm)-in reply-I thank all honour-,25
NA,able members who have contributed to this,25
NA,debate. The purpose of the International,25
NA,Monetary Agreements Amendment (Finan-,25
NA,cial Assistance) Bill 2009 is to amend the,25
NA,International Monetary Agreements Act,25
NA,1947-the IMA Act-to extend the current,25
NA,provisions that enable the Treasurer to lend,25
NA,money or enter into a currency swap with a,25
NA,country in support of an International Mone-,25
NA,tary Fund program. The amendments extend,25
NA,the current arrangements to include support,25
NA,for the World Bank and the Asian Develop-,25
NA,ment Bank. The amendments will enable,25
NA,Australia to provide a standby loan to Indo-,25
NA,"nesia if needed, as well as to enter into a loan",25
NA,or currency swap with other countries to,25
NA,support World Bank or ADB programs in the,25
NA,future should the need arise. Consistent with,25
NA,the 1998 International Monetary Agreements,25
NA,"Amendment Bill, this bill will allow Austra-",25
NA,lia to continue to play its part in international,25
NA,cooperation efforts. It is in Australia's na-,25
NA,tional interest to support stability and eco-,25
NA,"nomic recovery, particularly in our region, an",25
NA,issue on which there is an established history,25
NA,of bipartisanship.,25
NA,The bill also extends the same conditions,25
NA,currently contained in the IMA Act that ap-,25
NA,"ply to IMF programs. That is to say, there",25
NA,must be a request by the World Bank or the,25
NA,ADB for Australia's assistance. The agree-,25
NA,ment must allow Australia to require repay-,26
NA,ment if the World Bank or ADB program is,26
NA,suspended or prematurely terminated. The,26
NA,Treasurer must be satisfied that the other,26
NA,countries or international organisations in-,26
NA,volved will also be providing support to the,26
NA,recipient country as part of the World Bank,26
NA,or ADB program.,26
NA,Consistent with the IMA Act the bill will,26
NA,continue to require public release and tabling,26
NA,in each house of parliament of a national,26
NA,interest statement relating to an agreement,26
NA,entered into by Australia under the bill.,26
NA,Statements will include a description of the,26
NA,nature and terms of the agreement and set,26
NA,"out why it is in the national interest, having",26
NA,"regard in particular to foreign policy, trade",26
NA,and economic interests.,26
NA,The Australian government is tackling the,26
NA,financial crisis both at home and in coopera-,26
NA,tion with others internationally. This bill will debt.,26
NA,enable Australia to contribute to World Bank,26
NA,and ADB financial assistance programs,26
NA,should the need arise. Provisions contained,26
NA,in the bill will ensure Australia is able to,26
NA,spond quickly to requests to participate in,26
NA,international cooperation efforts during times,26
NA,of crisis and that this assistance is in Austrapromises,26
NA,lia's national interest. I commend the bill to,26

NA,by Ms Roxon:,26
NA,That this bill be now read a second time.,26
Mr DUTTON ,Dickson) (12.40 pm)-,26
NA,The Health Insurance Amendment (Extended,26
NA,Medicare Safety Net) Bill 2009 represents,26
NA,yet another Labor attack on health care for,26
NA,Australians. The measures contained in this,26
NA,bill will put a cap on payments under the,26
NA,Medicare safety net for a variety of medical,26
NA,"services, putting those treatments out of the",26
NA,reach of a great many Australians and impos-,26
NA,ing yet another burden on ordinary Austra-,26
NA,lians at a time when they can least afford it,26
NA,because of this government's reckless spend-,26
NA,"ing, which is pushing this nation into record",26
NA,The government will make savings of,26
NA,$450 million over four years as a result of,26
NA,rethis measure. This bill comes just days after,26
NA,the Prime Minister and his Minister for,26
NA,Health and Ageing shredded the solemn,26
NA,that they made over a lengthy pe-,26
NA,riod of time not to change private health in-,26
NA,"surance rebate regimes, which encourage",26
NA,Australians to take out health insurance and,26
NA,in doing so relieve some of the pressure on,26
NA,the nation's public healthcare system. Not,26
NA,content with that attack on one of the funda-,26
NA,mentals that have given Australia one of the,26
NA,"best health systems in the world, the gov-",26
NA,ernment is now intent on bringing more pain,26
NA,to Australians requiring various medical,26
NA,treatments-in the main to elderly Austra-,26
NA,lians needing cataract surgery and young,26
NA,couples either having children or needing,26
NA,help to do so.,26
NA,Health featured heavily in this govern-,26
NA,ment's campaign for office with a lengthy,26
NA,list of the things that it would or would not,26
NA,do. Before the House now is a bill that does,27
NA,exactly what this government said it would,27
NA,not do. This bill represents yet another bro-,27
NA,ken promise on health from this government,27
NA,and Australians are now starting to realise,27
NA,that Mr Rudd would clearly say anything at,27
NA,all or do anything at all in his pursuit of,27
NA,power. Let us look at what the health minis-,27
NA,ter was saying with regard to the Medicare,27
NA,safety net in the run-up to the last election.,27
NA,Here is what she said to the Meet the Press,27
NA,program in September 2007:,27
NA,We are setting out a comprehensive plan and the,27
NA,safety net is part of that plan that we are commitones,27
NA,ted to and we will be running on for the election.,27
NA,Today we see what the minister's commit-,27
NA,ments mean. Let us look back again to Sep-,27
NA,tember 2007 and to one of those now infa-,27
NA,mous joint media releases from now Prime,27
NA,Minister Rudd and Minister Roxon:,27
NA,A Rudd Labor government will retain the Medi-,27
NA,care safety net as Australian working families-,27
NA,Let me repeat that: as Australian working,27
NA,families-,27
NA,have come to rely on it for help with their family,27
NA,budgets.,27
NA,The document goes on:,27
NA,Federal Labor will not put more pressure on fam-,27
NA,ily budgets by taking that assistance away.,27
NA,One can only wonder what working families,27
NA,think right now. There has been no other pe-,27
NA,riod in recent times when working families,27
NA,have been under more pressure than they are,27
NA,right now. One million Australians earning,27
NA,"less than $26,000 a year have private health",27
NA,insurance. This health minister says they will,27
NA,not be hurt by her attack on insurance re-,27
NA,bates. Wait until premiums rise by more than,27
NA,would have been necessary and let us see if,27
NA,they are not hurt then. She also says that the,27
NA,measures in these bills which cap payments,27
NA,under the Medicare safety net will not hurt.,27
NA,Tell that to Australia's senior citizens and,27
NA,"pensioners, one of the groups most impacted",27
NA,by this government action.,27
NA,The extended Medicare safety net was in-,27
NA,troduced by the former coalition government,27
NA,in 2004 to protect Australians from high out-,27
NA,of-pocket expenses for medical services pro-,27
NA,vided out of hospital. About one million Aus-,27
NA,tralians each year receive payments under,27
NA,the safety net to help them with their large,27
NA,"medical bills-among them, no doubt, many",27
NA,"working families, many senior Australians",27
NA,and pensioners and many young people start-,27
NA,ing or seeking to start a family. They are the,27
NA,who will be hit hardest by the caps the,27
NA,government now seeks to put on the Medi-,27
NA,care safety net.,27
NA,Caps are to be put on: all obstetric ser-,27
NA,vices; some pregnancy related ultrasounds;,27
NA,"all assisted reproductive technology, includ-",27
NA,ing IVF; varicose vein treatment; and cata-,27
NA,ract surgery. Cataract surgery gets hit twice,27
NA,by this government-in these measures and,27
NA,elsewhere in the government's budget. It is,27
NA,unbelievable. Now the government blames,27
NA,doctors for the need to impose these changes,27
NA,to the Medicare safety net and Australians,27
NA,who incur high medical costs and benefit,27
NA,from it. ‘Doctors are taking advantage of the,27
NA,safety net; doctors are charging excessive,27
NA,fees' has become the somewhat repetitive,27
NA,"refrain. Of course, it has nothing to do with",27
NA,the government's debt splurge that now re-,27
NA,quires them to find every cent of saving they,27
NA,can in this budget to fund the $300 billion of,27
NA,debt this nation will be saddled with in a few,27
NA,short years. Senior Australians needing cata-,27
NA,ract surgery must pay for this government's,27
NA,"reckless behaviour, so too must young cou-",27
NA,ples seeking to start a family.,27
NA,These changes pose very important ques-,27
NA,tions. Did the government really think,27
NA,through what these changes would mean?,27
NA,Are they sure of what they are doing here?,27
NA,Let us have a look at cataract surgery. Under,27
NA,this bill a cap is going to be placed on one,28
NA,"cataract procedure, but this will combine",28
NA,with other budget measures to bring about,28
NA,significant changes. The government will,28
NA,halve the MBS rebates for this medical pro-,28
NA,cedure from around $600 to around $300.,28
NA,"Patients, many of them senior Australians-",28
NA,pensioners and retirees-will have to pay,28
NA,hundreds of dollars out of their own pocket,28
NA,and for some procedures only a small part,28
NA,will now be recoverable from the safety net.,28
NA,"Around 120,000 or more Australians un-",28
NA,"dergo surgery each year, with 200,000 cata-",28
NA,ract operations. The majority of cataract op-,28
NA,erations-70 per cent-are done in the pri-,28
NA,"vate system, with only 30 per cent done in",28
NA,public hospitals. There are substantial wait-,28
NA,ing lists for treatment in the public system.,28
NA,The effect of this would seem to be to drive,28
NA,patients to the already congested public,28
NA,health system. That is at the core of so many,28
NA,of the government's ill thought out decisions,28
NA,in health. At the last election they promised,28
NA,they would fix public hospitals by mid-2009,28
NA,"and now, if we reflect on the 18 months since",28
NA,"they made that announcement, every deci-",28
NA,sion they have taken in health will put only,28
NA,more pressure on the public health system.,28
NA,The Combined Pensioners and Superan-,28
NA,nuants Association of New South Wales has,28
NA,described these changes as ‘disastrous'. The,28
NA,association says that the costs will prove im-,28
NA,possible for pensioners and other low-,28
NA,income earners to meet and they will not,28
NA,receive what is an essential medical service.,28
NA,They believe services in regional and rural,28
NA,areas could be cut altogether. Noted eye sur-,28
NA,geon Dr Bill Glasson agrees. He has restored,28
NA,the sight of thousands of people in rural and,28
NA,remote areas of Australia. It is worth hearing,28
NA,what he has to say about what this govern-,28
NA,ment is doing. He told the ABC:,28
NA,The impact really is going to be on the battlers,28
NA,"across Australia, particularly those in rural",28
NA,"regional Australia, particularly Indigenous and it's",28
NA,just going to make things tougher and tougher.,28
NA,They've given the pensioners $30 on one hand,28
NA,and effectively taking $300 with the other hand-,28
NA,it is a very short-sighted decision and all this is,28
NA,going to do is drive more and more people out,28
NA,onto the public waiting list.,28
NA,That is what this minister and the Prime,28
NA,Minister-this government that promised to,28
NA,"fix health-are doing to the battlers, to the",28
NA,working families and to the pensioners of our,28
NA,country.,28
NA,Seventy per cent of people aged in their,28
NA,80s will suffer cataracts. Surgery that re-,28
NA,stores vision has other beneficial outcomes.,28
NA,"Of course, if people who are ageing have",28
NA,difficulty with their sight they are likely to,28
NA,"have falls, fractures, hospitalisation and",28
NA,treatment for other outcomes of poor vision.,28
NA,This government is going to block those,28
NA,"people from having this life-saving, and life-",28
NA,"changing in many cases, surgery. It is incon-",28
NA,ceivable that this government could believe,28
NA,that this is a measure that ultimately will re-,28
NA,sult in savings.,28
NA,The Society of Ophthalmologists has de-,28
NA,scribed the government's action as a ‘huge,28
NA,blow' to patients. It says it will put the cost,28
NA,of private cataract surgery beyond the reach,28
NA,"of average Australians. Remember, 70 per",28
NA,cent of all current cataract surgery is carried,28
NA,out in the private sector. What does that say,28
NA,for the public sector from here? More pa-,28
NA,tients waiting longer. Ophthalmology already,28
NA,has the longest waiting times of any special-,28
NA,ist surgery. That is the result of this govern-,28
NA,ment's broken promises. This is hardly what,28
NA,you would call fixing health. There are the,28
NA,broken promises and then there is the hypoc-,28
NA,risy.,28
NA,This bill is going to cap payments to Aus-,28
NA,tralian couples who need help in starting a,28
NA,family. Assisted reproductive technology and,28
NA,"and IVF will be hit hard. More than 40,000 peo-",28
NA,ple accessed IVF services last year with the,28
NA,support of the Medicare safety net. It is esti-,29
NA,"mated that 11,000 babies were born in this",29
NA,country as a result. Medical sources also es-,29
NA,timate that one in six couples will have fertil-,29
NA,ity problems of some sort and need assis-,29
NA,tance to start a family.,29
NA,I do not need to speak against this meas-,29
NA,ure. I will let members of the Rudd cabinet,29
NA,do that. Their hypocrisy in putting this meas-,29
NA,ure forward is astounding. Only three years,29
NA,ago none other than the Deputy Prime Minis-,29
NA,ter was extremely vocal in her support for,29
NA,"IVF. Now she sits on the sidelines, it seems,",29
NA,in silence as this measure is pushed through,29
NA,by her own government. Julia Gillard pre-,29
NA,sented petitions to this parliament in support,29
NA,of IVF treatment. At that time she spoke out,29
NA,against mooted changes to Medicare and,29
NA,"said, ‘Labor opposes any cutbacks to Medi-",29
NA,care funding of IVF.' Let me repeat that for,29
NA,the benefit of the House and for all Austra-,29
NA,lians listening to this debate: ‘Labor opposes,29
NA,any cutbacks to Medicare funding of IVF.',29
NA,"What a cruel hoax that was, Deputy Prime",29
NA,Minister. What a disgrace that you are now,29
NA,part of a government which is ripping apart,29
NA,the support to those people who are most in,29
NA,need. The Deputy Prime Minister also said,29
NA,only three short years ago:,29
NA,It is a cruel thing to do to Australian women,29
NA,"ticularly older Australian women, whose only",29
NA,hope of falling pregnant is through the IVF proc-,29
NA,ess.,29
NA,"That was the Deputy Prime Minister's view,",29
NA,which was reflected by many who are now in,29
NA,government when they were on the back,29
NA,"bench of the Labor opposition. Clearly, they",29
NA,have done a complete about-face. That is,29
NA,what makes the government such a joke,29
NA,when they talk about their commitment to,29
NA,fixing health. Everything they have done,29
NA,over the last 18 months in the health program,29
NA,has put only extra pressure on an already,29
NA,overstretched system.,29
NA,No fewer than four Labor members pre-,29
NA,"sented petitions to this House four years ago,",29
NA,"among them Ministers Emerson and Burke,",29
NA,"and perhaps even the current Treasurer, Mr",29
NA,"Swan, joined the campaign in favour of IVF.",29
NA,Where are these people now? That is not my,29
NA,question but the question of thousands of,29
NA,people who feel betrayed by this govern-,29
NA,"ment, thousands of Australians who feel",29
NA,ripped off by this government. This clearly is,29
NA,"a policy driven by Treasury, not by Health. It",29
NA,"is a policy driven by Treasury and Finance,",29
NA,and it cannot have any basis in good health,29
NA,outcomes. It cannot be the basis for this gov-,29
NA,ernment's decision to rip away support for,29
NA,"needy Australians, the people who rely on",29
NA,that safety net.,29
NA,"I have met, spoken and corresponded with",29
NA,thousands of Australians in relation to their,29
NA,experience on IVF. I want to bring to the,29
NA,attention of the House one compelling case. I,29
NA,read from a Friends of QFG Newsletter,29
NA,which was presented to me by one of my,29
NA,"constituents. For the benefit of the House, I",29
NA,will read some excerpts from a letter to the,29
NA,editor of that particular newsletter:,29
NA,Brian and I had been married for about 7 years,29
NA,and although he had been ready for children from,29
NA,day 1 I was now finally ready. It was June 1998,29
NA,… I was only 27. We tried with no success and,29
NA,parBrian had a sperm test with his GP that came,29
NA,back perfect. I then went to my GP and was told,29
NA,to relax and have a holiday “you're young” don't,29
NA,worry about it.,29
NA,The letter goes on to say:,29
NA,We managed to get in to see Dr Bob Watson in,29
NA,February 2004. He asked an enormous amount of,29
NA,questions and sent both Brian and I off for more,29
NA,"dreaded blood tests that seemed to never end, this",29
NA,was the start of attempting to overcome my fear,29
NA,of needles …,29
NA,… … …,29
NA,Well we rocked up refreshed and eager to get this,29
NA,over with even though we were told that IUIs,29
NA,probably wouldn't work for us but it's worth giv-,29
NA,ing it a go. Two attempts at that was more than,30
NA,"enough for me, bring on the big guns that should",30
NA,work. Off to Wickham Terrace to meet with Gail,30
NA,for the details about IVF and all the drugs.,30
NA,We started out the first of what was to be all 8,30
NA,"stimulated IVF cycles on 11 June 2004, the first",30
NA,FSH injection (125 units) was on our 13th wed-,30
NA,"ding anniversary 29 June 2004. That first cycle,",30
NA,"although in hindsight one of the worst, was good",30
NA,because we really didn't know what we were,30
NA,doing or what to expect. I knew that the chance of,30
NA,success on the first go was slim but I was very,30
NA,positive and when it failed before I even had my,30
NA,blood test I fell in a heap. I just sat on the bath-,30
NA,room floor and cried.,30
NA,… … …,30
NA,Brian and I picked ourselves up from that cycle,30
NA,and thought if we went back quickly that would,30
NA,be the best way to cope. The second cycle started,30
NA,in September we got 9 eggs (due to 600 units of,30
NA,FSH) but none fertilized …,30
NA,November 2004 was to be our third cycle … This,30
NA,"cycle also was the first time we used ICSI, we",30
NA,couldn't have coped with another cycle with no,30
NA,transfer so we hoped this was the answer … By,30
NA,this stage we had never had any embryos good,30
NA,"enough to freeze so we had 3 transferred, but",30
NA,again it wasn't to be.,30
NA,I changed jobs because the stress at work was too,30
NA,"much and we thought that this would help, well it",30
NA,didn't. It was easier though as I decided it was,30
NA,easier not to tell my workmates. This was one,30
NA,"place I could go and not think about IVF, it was",30
NA,great. I also joined the Friends of QFG commit-,30
NA,"tee, I felt they had helped me so much that if I",30
NA,could help one person the way they had helped,30
NA,me it would be great.,30
NA,We started our fourth cycle in April 2005. This,30
NA,failed and to top it all off I got a nasty infection.,30
NA,"Still not willing to give up, our 5th cycle began in",30
NA,"June 2005, Bob did the pickup, we got 14 eggs,",30
NA,"that was the most so far and 9 fertilised, surely it",30
NA,"would work this time, Dr Kilvert transferred 2 of",30
NA,our precious embryos and I still didn't make it to,30
NA,a blood test.,30
NA,… … …,30
NA,The sixth cycle this was the worst EVER. I got 13,30
NA,eggs and 10 fertilised. Bob said they were the,30
NA,"worst quality yet, but we had 3 transferred.",30
NA,This lady goes on to say:,30
NA,"full Maybe 7 was the cycle for us, a new year a new",30
NA,"attitude. Three were transferred this time, with the",30
NA,"works, ICSI, hatching, embryo glue and more",30
NA,"drugs Cardiprin, Prednisone and HCG injections",30
NA,"after transfer. We went on holidays and relaxed, it",30
NA,had to work this time. We made it to the blood,30
NA,"test, but it wasn't to be. A week later I was so sick",30
NA,I had stopped the prednisone the same as I had on,30
NA,previous cycles but this time it was a higher dose,30
NA,and my body could not deal with it. Brian touched,30
NA,me on the arm and I sobbed because my skin hurt,30
NA,intensely …,30
NA,… … …,30
NA,I had begun to have severe pain on day 2 of my,30
NA,"cycle the previous September, so I asked Bob",30
NA,what he could do about this and he scheduled,30
NA,"laparoscopy etc on 10 March 2006, this only dis-",30
NA,covered mild endo.,30
NA,Brian and I were starting to get quite down about,30
NA,"the whole IVF thing by now, so I decided we",30
NA,would try everything.,30
NA,"This lady goes on to say, ‘We tried boot",30
NA,"camp,' and:",30
NA,… walking group 2 nights per week. Bob had,30
NA,suggested that losing a bit of weight might help,30
NA,… I also saw a Dietician …,30
NA,… … …,30
NA,"This lady continues, ‘I wanted to see this",30
NA,particular doctor and was referred by the,30
NA,specialist.' She goes on to say:,30
NA,(the immunologist) phoned me on day 2 of what,30
NA,was to be our 8th cycle (8 has always been my,30
NA,favourite and lucky number). He told me to take,30
NA,"Cardiprin, Caltrate, Folate and Vitamin E and get",30
NA,some tests done the next day. The test took 13,30
NA,vials of blood. The cycle went well … and I had,30
NA,"the transfer on Good Friday, then came the",30
NA,dreaded 2 week wait with the added bonus of,30
NA,Fragmin injections daily from day 3 after transfer,30
NA,and 2 lots of HCG top ups. I made it to the blood,30
NA,test on the Friday of the Labour day long week-,30
NA,"end. I felt good, but the test came back negative",30
NA,… Bob convinced us to talk to one of the scien-,30
NA,tists and then come and see him as he wanted to,31
NA,discuss “donor eggs” with us again. At the end of,31
NA,the appointment Brian mentioned that the dreaded,31
NA,"period had not arrived yet, so Bob sent me for",31
NA,another blood test the next morning. It came back,31
NA,"positive, Bob thought maybe it was ectopic so I",31
NA,"went back 2 days later, it had doubled and then",31
NA,again the next week it had more than doubled,31
NA,each day. Then finally a scan and the look on,31
NA,Bob's face when he saw the heartbeat was price-,31
NA,less. Brian and I couldn't believe it. We were,31
NA,pregnant. Many scans later I was finally an ob-,31
NA,"stetrics patient, I never thought I would see that",31
NA,day … 18 weeks and Brian found out what we,31
NA,"were having, I didn't want to know it as I had",31
NA,always from the transfer felt I was meant to have,31
NA,"a girl. 24, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36 week scans finally",31
NA,whether I wanted to know or not it was obvious,31
NA,we were having a girl. It still felt like the,31
NA,"wait, the Fragmin was coming to an end, for a",31
NA,"needle phobic like me it was about time, 8 months",31
NA,of injections every day. Yuck. The Cardiprin fin-,31
NA,ished on week 37 and Emily Charlotte was born,31
NA,at 1.46pm. 22 December 2006 (my Dad's birth-,31
NA,day) at five pound 10 ounces by caesarean. Bob,31
NA,declared she was perfect and Brian and I could,31
NA,"finally breathe a sigh of relief, she was here.",31
NA,We have met some fabulous people throughout,31
NA,"our journey, people who truly understand just",31
NA,what you're going through. Our thanks go out to,31
NA,all of them …,31
NA,"There is a little bit more to the letter, but I",31
NA,will finish there. That was by two amazing,31
NA,"Australians, two people who represent the",31
NA,stories of so many thousands. It is very tough,31
NA,to read for any of us who have been involved,31
NA,in this debate. It is an emotional debate be-,31
NA,"cause people's lives, their futures and their",31
NA,perspectives on life are changed as a result of,31
NA,this particular cruel outcome by this gov-,31
NA,ernment.,31
NA,No contributor to this debate could sit op-,31
NA,posite and say honestly to the parliament this,31
NA,is a good health outcome. That is why the,31
NA,"Deputy Prime Minister, when she was Dep-",31
NA,"uty Leader of the Labor Party in opposition,",31
NA,stood up and rallied against any proposed,31
NA,changes. She railed against those changes,31
NA,because she knew that support should not be,31
NA,taken away from families who needed that,31
NA,support at their most desperate hour and de-,31
NA,served to have that continuing support. This,31
NA,"is a government that, of course, has gone into",31
NA,incredible debt-that is not a political state-,31
NA,ment; it is a fact. The economic certainty is,31
NA,not there at the moment; it has changed sig-,31
NA,"nificantly over the last 12 or 18 months, at",31
NA,the same time that the government has spent,31
NA,$42 billion-not one of those dollars in,31
NA,health. Why would it continue with these,31
NA,cruel cuts when it knows that it has the ca-,31
NA,pacity in other areas to allocate the money to,31
NA,save these people the extra stress? The story,31
NA,2 week that I just read out completely and ade-,31
NA,quately represents the feelings of many of,31
NA,these people who have gone through IVF to,31
NA,"create a family, to make their mark on the",31
NA,"world, to bring a child into the world. There",31
NA,is no better reason for our existence than to,31
NA,bring new life into this world. This govern-,31
NA,ment's cruel attack on the ability of families,31
NA,to be able to access that support really should,31
NA,stand condemned.,31
NA,I say to the government: the coalition will,31
NA,offer bipartisan support in trying to find,31
NA,other savings to offset this measure if the,31
NA,government sees fit to reverse it. We will,31
NA,work in a bipartisan way to see that this sup-,31
NA,port is kept for those thousands of Austra-,31
NA,lians who deserve this support from their,31
NA,government. We will work with the govern-,31
NA,ment to make sure that we relieve the burden,31
NA,that is now being put on these families at a,31
NA,time when they need anything but more bur-,31
NA,den. The story that I just read is compelling,31
NA,because it describes in some detail the in-,31
NA,credible pressure that these families-in,31
NA,some cases for years and years and years-,31
NA,"and, in particular, the women involved in",31
NA,these processes endure. Why on earth we as,31
NA,a parliament and this government would put,31
NA,extra pressure on those families in a time of,31
NA,most need is completely beyond any reason-,32
NA,able voice as part of this debate. We say to,32
NA,the government: ‘Please reconsider your po-,32
NA,sition. Reconsider your position in light of,32
NA,the comments made by the Deputy Prime,32
NA,Minister when she was sitting in opposition,32
NA,as Deputy Leader of the Labor Party.' None,32
NA,of the facts have changed in relation to this,32
NA,debate from the time that the Deputy Prime,32
NA,Minister made her comments to this debate,32
NA,today. None of the facts have changed when,32
NA,petitions by the thousands were presented to,32
NA,this parliament by other members who now,32
NA,sit on the front bench of the government.,32
NA,None of the facts have changed which would,32
NA,lend any credibility to a change in the posi-,32
NA,tion and the arrival at what the government,32
NA,now proposes.,32
NA,That is the position of the coalition. We,32
NA,offer support to the government to see a,32
NA,more rational outcome. We want to make,32
NA,sure that these families who have incredible,32
NA,pressures on them already have some of that,32
NA,"pressure relieved, not more put on them.",32
NA,"That is our call on the government, and that",32
NA,is what we will continue to fight for on be-,32
NA,half of so many Australians over the coming,32
NA,period of this debate.,32
Ms HALL ,Shortland) (1.04 pm)-The,32
NA,Health Insurance Amendment (Extended,32
NA,Medicare Safety Net) Bill 2009 amends the,32
NA,Health Insurance Act 1973 to enable the,32
NA,Minister for Health and Ageing to determine,32
NA,the maximum benefit payable under the ex-,32
NA,tended Medicare safety net-I will refer to it,32
NA,from here on in as the EMSN-for each,32
NA,"Medical Benefits Schedule, MBS, item. The",32
NA,bill creates a mechanism by which the gov-,32
NA,ernment can responsibly manage the expen-,32
NA,diture on the EMSN. I need to state very,32
NA,clearly at the commencement of my contri-,32
NA,bution to this debate: this legislation does,32
NA,remove any item from the MBS; all items,32
NA,remain on the schedule. What it does is put a,32
NA,cap on the MBS item which is determined in,32
NA,line with the median cost or charge that is,32
NA,made by specialists. Median cost means that,32
NA,that is the midpoint in the cost schedule.,32
NA,There are some specialists who are charging,32
NA,"rather exorbitant fees, but I will come to that",32
NA,later in my contribution to the debate.,32
NA,"As I have already mentioned, the EMSN",32
NA,benefit cap will apply to benefits for MBS,32
NA,"items, which will be payable in addition to",32
NA,the standard Medicare rebate once a patient,32
NA,reaches the EMSN threshold. Each patient,32
NA,will be eligible to receive up to the EMSN,32
NA,benefit cap each time they receive a service.,32
NA,There will be no limit on service; each time,32
NA,they will be able to receive that benefit. Once,32
NA,an individual or a member of a registered,32
NA,family reaches the applicable out-of-pocket,32
NA,"EMSN threshold, the person is entitled to an",32
NA,increase in the Medicare benefit equal to 80,32
NA,per cent of their out-of-pocket expenses for,32
NA,that claim for the rest of the calendar year. I,32
NA,am sure that members on both sides of this,32
NA,House are acquainted with constituents,32
NA,within their electorates who fall into this,32
NA,category.,32
NA,The increased amount of the Medicare,32
NA,benefit payable under the EMSN is com-,32
NA,monly referred to as EMSN benefit. A differ-,32
NA,ent level of EMSN benefit cap can apply to,32
NA,different EMSN items. The EMSN benefit,32
NA,"cap would be a dollar value. For example, an",32
NA,EMSN benefit cap of $100 may apply to one,32
NA,item and for a different item it may be $500.,32
NA,There are three things that I have sought to,32
NA,establish here: (1) no item is excluded from,32
NA,the MBS (2) the caps can vary according to,32
NA,the item number and (3) those people who,32
NA,reach the EMSN threshold will continue to,32
NA,receive a refund equal to 80 per cent of their,32
NA,Medicare benefits.,32
NA,Currently there is no limit on the amount,32
NA,not of benefit payable under the EMSN and a,32
NA,person will receive 80 per cent of out-of-,32
NA,"pocket expenses for services, which means",32
NA,"that, if a doctor chooses to charge an exorbi-",33
NA,"tant fee, that patient will still receive an",33
NA,per cent refund. One patient may go to a doc-,33
NA,tor who charges $500 for an item on the,33
NA,MBS and another patient may go to one who,33
NA,"charges $2,000 for the same service. This",33
NA,legislation provides for the fact that some,33
NA,doctors are charging three or four times what,33
NA,other doctors charge for the same item num-,33
NA,ber. Taking a midpoint from the example I,33
NA,"just gave, the median figure would be",33
NA,"$1,000.",33
NA,This legislation enables the minister to de-,33
NA,"termine the cap on the EMSN benefit, which",33
NA,will be set out in the legislative instruments.,33
NA,"The bill will cover 15 obstetric items, which",33
NA,will generate a saving of $451.6 million over,33
NA,four years. As has been mentioned in the,33
NA,"debate so far, these savings were part of the",33
NA,2009-10 budget. The implementation date for,33
NA,the bill is 1 January next year.,33
NA,As the shadow minister for health and,33
NA,"ageing rightly pointed out, one area that will",33
NA,be impacted is IVF. As a member of this par-,33
NA,"liament, I am very supportive of IVF. As-",33
NA,"sisted reproduction has helped many people,",33
NA,including people I know-family and,33
NA,friends-to have that much sought after,33
NA,child. This legislation in no way seeks to,33
NA,stop that. The shadow minister gave an ex-,33
NA,ample in relation to a woman who underwent,33
NA,eight cycles. She will still be able to undergo,33
NA,eight cycles under this legislation. There is,33
NA,no limit on the number of cycles a person,33
NA,may undergo. If members on the other side,33
NA,of this House are going to argue that the,33
NA,"islation limits the number of cycles, they are",33
NA,misrepresenting the legislation. I emphasise,33
NA,yet again: what it does is put a cap on par-,33
NA,ticular MBS services.,33
NA,The extended Medicare safety net service,33
NA,will continue for all Australians and for all,33
NA,services currently covered. The safety net,33
NA,threshold has not been changed from the,33
NA,$555.70 for Commonwealth concession card,33
NA,"80 holders and $1,111.60 for all others in each",33
NA,"calendar year. It is indexed each year, and",33
NA,"will continue to be indexed each year, in line",33
NA,with the consumer price index. The govern-,33
NA,ment is not seeking and will not seek to,33
NA,means test access to the EMSN. It seems to,33
NA,me that a lot of the speakers on this debate,33
NA,from the other side of the House have sought,33
NA,to scare people in the community. I find that,33
NA,the approach of the opposition in relation to,33
NA,this has been less than optimal.,33
NA,Another matter was brought up by the,33
NA,member for Dickson that I would like to,33
NA,touch on. He referred to ophthalmic sur-,33
NA,"geons. Yes, that is one area upon which a cap",33
NA,"will be placed, but he also referred to how",33
NA,"that would impact on Indigenous Australians,",33
NA,linking it into private health insurance. I sus-,33
NA,pect that the member for Dickson should,33
NA,undertake a little research into how many,33
NA,Indigenous Australians will actually be af-,33
NA,fected by this. The answer would be: next to,33
NA,none. To come into this House and use that,33
NA,as part of his argument shows that he has,33
NA,very limited knowledge of health and very,33
NA,little knowledge particularly of Indigenous,33
NA,health and the needs of Indigenous Austra-,33
NA,lians. I would like him to consult with ex-,33
NA,"perts in this area, people who work on a day-",33
NA,"to-day basis with Indigenous Australians, to",33
NA,put some facts to the fiction he has been put-,33
NA,ting forward in the parliament today.,33
NA,The government chose to put this measure,33
NA,"in place, to cap benefits at a level which cov-",33
NA,leg- ers average payments. Reasonable amounts,33
NA,will not be affected. If a person visits a doc-,33
NA,"tor who charges a reasonable amount, an",33
NA,"average fee, they will receive a refund of 80",33
NA,per cent. There is no cycle limit and no items,33
NA,are being removed. Another thing the opposi-,33
NA,tion were touting is that it is going to affect,33
NA,"cancer patients, but cancer patients will not",33
NA,be affected.,33
NA,This measure has been well researched.,34
NA,The government commissioned a review to,34
NA,which evidence was given. The opposite side,34
NA,are saying that those in greatest financial,34
NA,need will miss out on the benefits. It is the,34
NA,patients with higher incomes who are claim-,34
NA,ing higher out-of-pocket expenses. The re-,34
NA,view found that for every EMSN benefit dol-,34
NA,lar paid to patients 78c went to meeting the,34
NA,doctor's higher fee rather than to reducing,34
NA,the patient's out-of-pocket expenses. I put,34
NA,very strongly to this parliament that the,34
NA,EMSN is about making services that Austra-,34
NA,"lians need more affordable, to enable them to",34
NA,"purchase services, to undertake IVF or to",34
NA,have a cataract operation. I would strongly,34
NA,"argue that, if 78c of each benefit dollar goes",34
NA,to meeting the doctor's higher fees rather,34
NA,than to reducing the patient's out-of-pocket,34
NA,"expenses, this scheme is not working in the",34
NA,way it was meant to. Putting the cap in place,34
NA,will ensure that patients benefit rather than,34
NA,"doctors. As I mentioned earlier, those who",34
NA,have benefited most from the more afford-,34
NA,able services have tended to be wealthier and,34
NA,in a better position to access some of the,34
NA,more expensive services in the first place.,34
NA,The EMSN did create some problems for,34
NA,"the Howard government, who raised the",34
NA,safety net expenditure threshold so that they,34
NA,could reduce the number of people who,34
NA,would qualify for the EMSN and they did,34
NA,that to rein in the cost. We are not doing that;,34
NA,"in this legislation, we are putting in place a",34
NA,cap designed to come into play at the aver-,34
NA,age fee point.,34
NA,I do not support what those on the other,34
NA,side of the parliament have been saying-,34
NA,that this is about stopping women or families,34
NA,"receiving IVF assistance; rather, it is about",34
NA,ensuring that they see doctors who charge an,34
NA,average fee. They will still get 80 per cent of,34
NA,"the EMSN. This is only about the high end,",34
NA,about doctors who charge exorbitant fees.,34
NA,There are doctors involved in IVF who earn,34
NA,incomes in excess of $4 million a year-,34
NA,rather a large salary. We support women con-,34
NA,tinuing to receive funding for an unlimited,34
NA,number of cycles and we support all items,34
NA,"remaining on the MBS, but we do not sup-",34
NA,port paying 80 per cent when doctors charge,34
NA,exorbitant fees.,34
NA,I support the legislation and I encourage,34
NA,those on the other side of the House to look,34
NA,"at what the legislation does, rather than put-",34
NA,"ting out a smear and fear campaign, as they",34
NA,always do. I encourage them to provide the,34
NA,"correct information to their constituents, tell-",34
NA,"ing women or pensioners who visit them,",34
NA,"‘Yes, you can still get 80 per cent of your fee",34
NA,"back, but you must go to a specialist who",34
NA,will charge a median fee and not an exorbi-,34
NA,tant fee.',34
Mr MORRISON ,Cook) (1.22 pm)-The,34
NA,Health Insurance Amendment (Extended,34
NA,Medicare Safety Net) Bill 2009 is a cruel,34
NA,bill. It is a heartless bill. Contrary to what,34
NA,"has just been suggested in this House, it has",34
NA,nothing to do with people having any restric-,34
NA,tion placed on them as to how many IVFs,34
NA,they can undertake. This bill will put up the,34
NA,"cost by between $1,500 and $2,000 a cycle",34
NA,for those who are looking to use assisted re-,34
NA,productive technologies. That is what the,34
NA,"impact of this bill will be and, for many Aus-",34
NA,"tralians, that will mean the end of the road of",34
NA,their dream to have children. It is a heartless,34
NA,"bill and it is a cruel bill, and to sit here in this",34
NA,place and listen to the suggestions put for-,34
NA,ward by those on the other side that this is all,34
NA,about overcharging doctors and there not,34
NA,being caps on how many times you can do it,34
NA,says one thing to me: they just do not get it.,34
NA,Those opposite really do not understand,34
NA,what the impact of this bill will be on people,34
NA,who are desperate to have children.,34
NA,Infertility is not a choice. It is not some-,34
NA,thing you wish for. It is not something that,34
NA,"you elect. It happens to you, like many",34
NA,things in life happen to you. Just under one,35
NA,in six couples of reproductive age in this,35
NA,country have a fertility problem. IVF is re-,35
NA,"sponsible for some 11,000 births each year.",35
NA,"Around 40,000 treatments were provided in",35
NA,2008. Around one child today in a classroom,35
NA,of 25 is in that classroom because of IVF and,35
NA,other related treatments. Forty per cent of,35
NA,"fertility problems relate to men, 40 per cent",35
NA,to women and 20 per cent are of non-specific,35
NA,"cause, which is one of the hardest things to",35
NA,deal with when you just do not know why.,35
NA,IVF and related assisted reproductive treat-,35
NA,ments are the only hope for people afflicted,35
NA,with infertility. I make reference to a state-,35
NA,"ment made by Sandra Dill, the Chief Execu-",35
NA,"tive of Access Australia, which is the group",35
NA,"that supports, represents and provides assis-",35
NA,tance to those who are going through this,35
NA,horrendous ordeal. She says:,35
NA,IVF is the last chance for many to have a child,35
NA,their own and the Medicare Safety Net has en-,35
NA,sured that every Australian has that opportunity.,35
NA,The Government's decision has taken away many,35
NA,Australians last chance to have a baby.,35
NA,This is a cause which sits very close to my,35
NA,heart. I have taken the unusual step today of,35
NA,returning from leave. My wife gave birth to a,35
NA,"child last Thursday-our second child, Lily",35
NA,"Alice. Our first child, Abbey Rose, was born",35
NA,on the 7th of the 7th of the 7th-14 years,35
NA,from when my wife and I began assisted re-,35
NA,"productive treatments, which consisted of 10",35
NA,IVF cycles. It was a horrendous ordeal. My,35
NA,wife had very difficult surgery and we were,35
NA,finally able to conceive a child without the,35
NA,ultimate assistance of IVF. Everything we,35
NA,"learned along the road-every day, every",35
NA,"lesson, every treatment and every piece of",35
NA,advice-was critical to our path and to the,35
NA,process of having children.,35
NA,The desire to have children is the most,35
NA,"positive, life-affirming instinct we as human",35
NA,beings have. The desire does not go away,35
NA,when you are told that you cannot have chil-,35
NA,dren or that you will have difficulty having,35
NA,them. The feeling of loss at every failed at-,35
NA,"tempt is indescribable. Others, removed from",35
NA,"the emotional hell, rationalise the failure of",35
NA,"embryos failing to take, while parents and",35
NA,want-to-be parents grieve the loss of chil-,35
NA,dren. We console ourselves with the thought,35
NA,that one day we will be reunited with our,35
NA,unborn child beyond this life. Added to this,35
NA,physical and emotional torment is the pres-,35
NA,sure that it places on extremely fragile rela-,35
NA,tionships working through these very diffi-,35
NA,cult issues.,35
NA,Most families understand the sacrifice in-,35
NA,volved in having children. They understand,35
NA,that as they have those children and see them,35
NA,growing up in their homes. It means many,35
NA,changes to our lives-many welcome,35
NA,"changes, I must add. But one of the reasons",35
NA,we as parents can deal with those sacrifices,35
NA,of is that it is accompanied by the sheer joy of,35
NA,parenthood-and there is nothing to match it.,35
NA,Some people go through fertility treatment,35
NA,over extended periods of time. You would,35
NA,have heard the member for Dickson recount,35
NA,"an incredibly moving story, which I am so",35
NA,pleased had a happy ending even though so,35
NA,many of these stories do not. For those going,35
NA,through the hell of fertility treatment over an,35
NA,"extended period of time, their first experi-",35
NA,ence of parenthood is only sacrifice. That is,35
NA,all that many will ever know; the joy of par-,35
NA,enthood never comes. The pain of these ex-,35
NA,periences is not altered by your level of in-,35
NA,come. It does not change how you feel and,35
NA,what goes on inside you. Regardless of how,35
NA,"much or how little you have, you do what-",35
NA,ever it takes to make this work. You make,35
NA,the sacrifices. You take out the extended loan,35
NA,or the second mortgage. You do whatever,35
NA,you need to do to try to realise that dream.,35
NA,For families going through this very dark,35
NA,"chapter of their lives, it is all consuming.",35
NA,The reason I am pointing this out is that I,35
NA,do not believe that those in the government,35
NA,have got a full handle on the depth of this,36
NA,issue or a real appreciation of the pain that,36
NA,they are going to inflict on their fellow Aus-,36
NA,tralians as a result of this measure. When you,36
NA,"go through this, everything comes into ques-",36
NA,"tion. You are challenged spiritually, emotion-",36
NA,"ally, physically and financially. You question",36
NA,"everything-God, each other, your priorities,",36
NA,your future. Nothing escapes scrutiny when,36
NA,you are going through this treatment and this,36
NA,ordeal. Along this road you will find the,36
NA,"wreckage of shattered lives, marriages and",36
NA,families. But when you do this you know the,36
NA,"risks you take, because you are so committed",36
NA,to and so passionate about the fact that one,36
NA,day you might be able to realise that dream,36
NA,"of bringing a child into the world, which I",36
NA,believe is a very pure dream.,36
NA,"Against this background, the government",36
NA,"has introduced this bill and has moved, as the",36
NA,"previous speaker said, to cap payments under",36
NA,the Medicare safety net for IVF and related,36
NA,fertility treatments. The bill also imposes,36
NA,caps on a range of other services-including,36
NA,"obstetric services, pregnancy related ultra-",36
NA,sounds and cataract surgery. I will not touch,36
NA,on these; the shadow minister has already,36
NA,mentioned these. The saving that is expected,36
NA,to be gained from this measure is $475 mil-,36
NA,"lion. Just to put that in context, that is less",36
NA,than two per cent of what the Labor govern-,36
NA,ment borrowed and gave away in cash pay-,36
NA,ments. So what we are seeing right here be-,36
NA,fore us in this bill is one of the many costs,36
NA,the spending that this government has en-,36
NA,gaged in.,36
NA,"As I mentioned at the start of my remarks,",36
NA,the cost for couples is estimated to rise from,36
NA,"$1,600 or thereabouts-and for many it is far",36
NA,more than that-in out-of-pocket expenses to,36
NA,"around $3,000 to $3,500. So when the previ-",36
NA,"ous speaker, the member for Shortland,",36
NA,makes the assertion that this measure will not,36
NA,end the dream of Australians seeking to have,36
NA,children she clearly does not understand,36
NA,what the consequences of the cap will be.,36
NA,The cost will go up significantly. It will more,36
NA,than double for some families and some cou-,36
NA,"ples-for many couples, I expect.",36
NA,I think Labor are in complete denial when,36
NA,it comes to this measure. I think they are,36
NA,looking to run and hide. I think they want,36
NA,this legislation to move through this parlia-,36
NA,"ment as quickly as possible because they are,",36
NA,"frankly, ashamed and embarrassed about it.",36
NA,They have taken a position on this matter,36
NA,which is in complete contradiction to what is,36
NA,"outlined in this bill, so they sit here in denial",36
NA,"and put forward these arguments, but,",36
NA,"frankly, they should sit silent because this is",36
NA,"an indefensible measure, particularly as it",36
NA,relates to IVF and related procedures. The,36
NA,pressure on these couples is hard enough-,36
NA,and I have given some of my own insight,36
NA,into that-without the added anguish of hav-,36
NA,ing to find that extra money. It is bad,36
NA,enough. It is hard enough. The relationships,36
NA,are already under enough stress. Having,36
NA,watched my wife go through these proce-,36
NA,"dures many, many times and seen the health",36
NA,"impacts on her as she dealt with them, to",36
NA,know that she then would have to also en-,36
NA,dure additional financial stress would be,36
NA,simply too much to bear. It will be too much,36
NA,"to bear for many, and they will just say, ‘I",36
NA,can't go on.',36
NA,I know what it is like to have reached that,36
NA,"point: after 10, we actually did reach that",36
NA,"of point. At some other time, we thought, we",36
NA,"might go forward again. Thanks be to God,",36
NA,"we had the situation where, after the surgery",36
NA,"and some years later, things happened. But",36
NA,that is not a normal story; that is actually,36
NA,quite a miraculous story. That is why we re-,36
NA,"fer to our little girl, Abbey Rose, as our",36
NA,miracle child. It does not always work out,36
NA,"like that-in fact, it rarely does. So I ask the",36
NA,government to be kind enough to listen. A,36
NA,week or so ago I recounted the story of Jenny,36
NA,and me in the Sunday Telegraph and I have,36
NA,had an enormous response from people go-,37
NA,ing through the same situation. I want to read,37
NA,out some of those responses. One said:,37
NA,My husband and I are currently going through,37
NA,IVF and it is not an easy path. Even with gov-,37
NA,"ernment subsidies, it is expensive. I can't believe",37
NA,that the government is going to implement,37
NA,changes which will make it even more difficult,37
NA,for couples who are already going through great,37
NA,emotion in their lives.,37
NA,Unless you've experienced the grief of infertility,37
NA,"and miscarriage, I doubt that anyone would be",37
NA,quite aware of the impact it can have on a per-,37
NA,"son's day-to-day life. The grief is ongoing,",37
NA,"mourning because of a failed cycle, utter devasta-",37
NA,"tion at yet another miscarriage. Yes, some people",37
NA,"go on to live fulfilling lives without children, but",37
NA,for my husband and I this is not an option we,37
NA,want to consider without first exhausting all pos-,37
NA,"sible options, including IVF first.",37
NA,I strongly encourage those affected by Mr Rudd's,37
NA,heartless decision to keep fighting this as it is,37
NA,only way that we can even try to stop this very,37
NA,cruel funding cut.,37
NA,"Again in 2008, another said:",37
NA,My husband and I had four unsuccessful IVF,37
NA,"attempts. This year is now a recovery year, emo-",37
NA,"tionally and financially, and we had all intentions",37
NA,of starting up again in 2010. This now looks to be,37
NA,unlikely due to the new changes the government,37
NA,"will be putting in place. Unless we win Lotto, the",37
NA,government has forced us to accept the fact that,37
NA,we could well remain childless forever. Not an,37
NA,easy realisation.,37
NA,These are not my words. These are the words,37
NA,"of those who are affected by this measure,",37
NA,and their voices should be heard. Another,37
NA,said:,37
NA,"I think a lot of people do not realise that, even",37
NA,"with the existing rebates, IVF is not free. Far",37
NA,"from it, in fact. Not to mention all the in-between",37
NA,"appointments, tests and exploratory procedures",37
NA,that seem to come with the territory. And no-one,37
NA,"ever thinks that they will need to go to IVF once,",37
NA,"let alone four or 10 times, so how can you prop-",37
NA,erly save or prepare for that expense when every-,37
NA,"one including the doctors, nurses, friends, fami-",37
NA,"lies tells you to never give up, the next cycle just",37
NA,might be the one that works. How can you simply,37
NA,give up and walk away from that hope or possi-,37
NA,bility?,37
NA,I wonder if Kevin Rudd or Wayne Swan would,37
NA,have made the same decision if any of their own,37
NA,children or friends needed fertility treatment.,37
NA,And again:,37
NA,"We are the unlucky ones: 13 cycles, one with a",37
NA,"miscarriage of eight weeks, nearly $80,000",37
NA,poorer. I would have kept going too. We bor-,37
NA,rowed money on three credit cards then finally,37
NA,had to extend our mortgage because we could not,37
NA,keep up with the payments. It would have been,37
NA,worth every single penny if we had conceived,37
NA,successfully.,37
NA,And another:,37
NA,I think the Rudd government did a good beat-up,37
NA,of IVF in the months coming into the budget with,37
NA,false facts that were made to look like IVF com-,37
NA,panies were profiting and the community was,37
NA,the paying 80 per cent of the IVF when in fact they,37
NA,only pay for a quarter of the total bill. Partly as a,37
NA,"result of this beat-up, the general community are",37
NA,indifferent to the cause. The cost that is included,37
NA,in the statements to the media only included the,37
NA,Medicare part of the cost of IVF and not the day,37
NA,"surgery, fertility specialist, appointments, non-",37
NA,"refundable tests like the SSA, which we had done.",37
NA,"This test cost approximately $800 alone, but",37
NA,made us realise we had a problem and contributed,37
NA,"to us changing some vitamins, succeeding in our",37
NA,second ISCI.,37
NA,These are the stories of those who deal with,37
NA,"this problem every day, and they understand",37
NA,what the impact of this bill is.,37
NA,Those who practise in the area also under-,37
NA,stand that it will put increased pressure on,37
NA,"the actual medical procedures themselves,",37
NA,because those who are going through these,37
NA,procedures will not want to risk the loss of,37
NA,an opportunity of going through a further,37
NA,cycle for financial reasons and they will ask,37
NA,to have additional eggs put back in. That,37
NA,increases the risk to a mother and increases,37
NA,the risk to both children in a multiple birth.,37
NA,This has not come from the opposition; this,38
NA,has come from medical practitioners in the,38
NA,"area. I know, as a parent now but as one who",38
NA,"went through this process, that these are the",38
NA,things that go through your head. These are,38
NA,the issues that you have to try to resolve. You,38
NA,do not want to have to take that extra risk.,38
NA,You do not want to have to go through that,38
NA,process again if you can avoid it. But you,38
NA,also have to try to maximise your chances of,38
NA,success-and if you do not have that next,38
NA,"chance, then you will take greater risks.",38
NA,I think what makes this measure even,38
NA,more disgraceful is the hypocrisy of the gov-,38
NA,"ernment in bringing it forward. In 2005, the",38
NA,"then shadow health minister, now the Deputy",38
NA,"Prime Minister, said:",38
NA,Labor completely opposes any cutbacks to Medi-,38
NA,care funding of IVF. Labor will be launching a,38
NA,petition against the changes to Medicare funded,38
NA,"IVF by the Howard government, tomorrow in",38
NA,Canberra.,38
NA,"Then, in a doorstop interview in 2005, she",38
NA,said:,38
NA,Tony Abbott and John Howard before the elec-,38
NA,"tion, were wandering around saying the best thing",38
NA,"about Medicare is that it's an uncapped scheme, a",38
NA,patient-driven scheme. The Prime Minister went,38
NA,"so far as to say that's fundamental. Well, what",38
NA,was fundamental before the election is expend-,38
NA,able after the election with this plan to cap Medi-,38
NA,care funding for IVF.,38
NA,John Howard and Tony Abbott should listen to,38
NA,"the Australian community, to the Labor Party and",38
NA,"to women within their own ranks, and back down",38
NA,today on this proposed very cruel cutback. And at,38
NA,the same time they should rule out capping Medi-,38
NA,care for other things that Minister Abbott deems,38
NA,non-essential.,38
NA,"Frankly, the Deputy Prime Minister and the",38
NA,"government should take their own advice,",38
NA,because on that occasion the government did,38
NA,listen and did change their policy. They lis-,38
NA,tened and they understood. They became,38
NA,sympathetic and understood the challenges,38
NA,that were faced by couples in this situation.,38
NA,They showed a heart and reversed the meas-,38
NA,ure.,38
NA,"That measure is in this parliament today,",38
NA,brought forward by those who gave that ad-,38
NA,vice to the previous government. I can think,38
NA,of no more bitter hypocrisy than that. But it,38
NA,"went further, because not only did they say",38
NA,those things in the press; they took up peti-,38
NA,"tions. They collected, in total, 1,759 signa-",38
NA,"tures, including those in a petition lodged by",38
NA,"the previous speaker, the member for Short-",38
NA,land. I am interested to know whether she is,38
NA,going to write to the 240 citizens who signed,38
NA,her petition to oppose cuts to Medicare fund-,38
NA,ing for IVF and tell them that her govern-,38
NA,ment are now going to do exactly what she,38
NA,was trying to get their support to stop the,38
NA,then government from doing. Is she going to,38
NA,write to those 240 citizens? Is the Deputy,38
NA,Prime Minister going to write to the more,38
NA,"than 1,300 citizens whose signatures she col-",38
NA,lected and apologise to them for her act of,38
NA,hypocrisy in being supportive of this bill,38
NA,coming before the House? She would not,38
NA,"even answer questions, when put to her in",38
NA,"this House, about whether she supported this",38
NA,"bill, given the fact that she had collected",38
NA,"more than 1,300 signatures opposing the",38
NA,measures that she in fact has brought before,38
NA,the House. There were also petitions from,38
NA,"the Treasurer, from the Minister for Agricul-",38
NA,"ture, Fisheries and Forestry, from the Minis-",38
NA,"ter for Small Business, Independent Contrac-",38
NA,"tors and the Service Economy, and from",38
NA,other members. The government said one,38
NA,thing and are doing another. Either they were,38
NA,being deceitful and disingenuous at that time,38
NA,or they are being heartless today. They can,38
NA,"take their pick, but either is abominable. Ei-",38
NA,"ther should bring them to the table, as the",38
NA,"shadow minister was saying before, to talk to",38
NA,the opposition about how these things can be,38
NA,avoided.,38
NA,The government's budget is dripping with,38
NA,"spending, yet they put through a cut like this",38
NA,which will deny a person the opportunity to,39
NA,"become a parent. For that, I think they need",39
NA,"to take a good, hard look at themselves in the",39
NA,mirror. There are savings that can be found,39
NA,"in this budget. In my shadow portfolio alone,",39
NA,the first home saver accounts have underper-,39
NA,formed by 96 per cent. Even if we just,39
NA,capped the scheme at 10 per cent of what its,39
NA,"projected take-up was going to be, the sav-",39
NA,ings over the next three years would be $700,39
NA,million. The Minister for Housing did not,39
NA,bring to the table one dollar of savings in,39
NA,housing portfolio that could have avoided the,39
NA,government bringing forward this measure.,39
NA,"She did not do that, and it was left to the",39
NA,Minister for Health and Ageing to find sav-,39
NA,ings. I must say that on other matters I have,39
NA,found the Minister for Health and Ageing to,39
NA,"be very encouraging, particularly in relation",39
NA,to epidermolysis bullosa and the support,39
NA,given in the budget to children suffering,39
NA,from that condition. I welcome that and I,39
NA,applaud and commend the minister for tak-,39
NA,ing what I think is a very compassionate po-,39
NA,sition. It cost $16 million and she was very,39
NA,supportive of our representations on the mat-,39
NA,ter. I encourage her now to speak to her col-,39
NA,leagues and encourage them to be compas-,39
NA,"sionate on this matter. When in opposition,",39
NA,the government opposed the very thing they,39
NA,have brought forward in this House. They,39
NA,cannot justify it on the basis that they have,39
NA,lost control of their budget. They should get,39
NA,control of their budget. They should avoid,39
NA,the inclination to bring in such heartless and,39
NA,"hypocritical measures. Most importantly,",39
NA,they must listen to the people who are af-,39
NA,fected and they must come to the table and,39
NA,change this measure immediately.,39
Mr NEUMANN ,Blair) (1.42 pm)-I rise,39
NA,to speak in support of the Health Insurance,39
NA,Amendment (Extended Medicare Safety Net),39
NA,"Bill 2009. First, I want to congratulate the",39
NA,member for Cook and his wife on the birth of,39
NA,their second child. I have two daughters my-,39
NA,"self. Fortunately, we did not have any diffi-",39
NA,"culties with my wife, Carolyn, falling preg-",39
NA,nant. My daughters are now 18 and 19. They,39
NA,are the love of our lives and we rejoice in,39
NA,"their development spiritually, educationally,",39
NA,socially and intellectually. It is wonderful to,39
NA,have children. They are a great blessing and,39
NA,heritage. Those of us of the Christian faith,39
NA,accept that scriptural injunction.,39
NA,"In relation to this bill, I say to the member",39
NA,for Cook that the trouble is that there is a,39
NA,the great deal of inconsistency between what the,39
NA,coalition are saying and what they did in,39
NA,practice when they were in power. The truth,39
NA,is that in my area alone they effectively de-,39
NA,funded health and hospital services. That is,39
NA,"the reality. We have one GP for every 1,609",39
NA,"people in my area, the Ipswich and West",39
NA,Moreton area in South-East Queensland.,39
NA,Even the former Minister for Health and,39
NA,"Ageing, the member for Warringah, admitted",39
NA,before the last election in October 2007 that,39
NA,the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare,39
NA,had got it absolutely correct in saying that,39
NA,"the previous coalition government, under",39
NA,"John Howard, had actually defunded health",39
NA,and hospitals in this country and that the,39
NA,states had had to take up the slack. The,39
NA,much-maligned state Labor governments had,39
NA,to take up the slack because the previous,39
NA,coalition government failed to fund health,39
NA,and hospital services. They capped the num-,39
NA,ber of doctors in this country.,39
NA,Labor has increased the number of train-,39
NA,ing places for doctors. We have put $1.1 bil-,39
NA,lion into that to increase the number of train-,39
NA,ing places and to encourage more people to,39
NA,go into medicine and the allied health profes-,39
NA,sions. We want to encourage nurses to go,39
NA,back into the system-into health and aged-,39
NA,care services. We want to try to get them,39
NA,working in regional and remote areas. One of,39
NA,the first things that the Rudd government did,39
NA,was to put in more money for elective sur-,39
NA,"gery. About $1.6 billion was put in, in accor-",39
NA,dance with agreements with the states. The,40
NA,member for Dickson said that there was little,40
NA,or no money put into health by the Rudd,40
NA,government under our Nation Building and,40
NA,Jobs Plan. I looked around on budget night,40
NA,and saw him in the chamber when the Treas-,40
NA,urer was talking about what the Rudd Labor,40
NA,government were doing to fund our health,40
NA,and hospital system. The Treasurer said:,40
NA,… Australians deserve a world-class health and,40
NA,hospital system.,40
NA,That is what we are providing. We are spend-,40
NA,ing a lot of money not only locally in my,40
NA,electorate but also nationally. What we are,40
NA,doing under the legislation that is before the,40
NA,House today is in accordance with the report,40
NA,that was delivered on this matter. What gets,40
NA,me is that those on that side of the House,40
NA,think they have a monopoly on family val-,40
NA,"ues, on compassion, on heart and on care.",40
NA,But they do not. This legislation that is be-,40
NA,fore the chamber is not about us being,40
NA,against women and men who struggle to,40
NA,have a child. It is not about that at all.,40
NA,gratulate the member for Cook for having,40
NA,two children and contributing. From what he,40
NA,"had to say, you could tell the love, the affir-",40
NA,"mation, the care, the wonder of birth and",40
NA,how fantastic it is that he and his wife have,40
NA,had children. We are not about punishing,40
NA,"people in these circumstances. In fact, the",40
NA,"inconsistency here is that in 1996, 1997,",40
NA,"1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003 and up to",40
NA,2004 those opposite actually agreed with the,40
NA,idea of having caps on Medicare. Do not,40
NA,come into this place and say that by putting,40
NA,"caps on funding we are heartless, cruel, mean",40
NA,and nasty. It is simply not true. Through most,40
NA,of the time of the Howard coalition govern-,40
NA,ment it supported the idea of having caps.,40
NA,Before the introduction of the safety net in,40
NA,2004 there was a limit on the amount of gov-,40
NA,ernment contribution for Medicare ser-,40
NA,"vices-that is, the Medicare schedule fee-",40
NA,but I did not hear the member for Dickson or,40
NA,the member for Cook say that. That was the,40
NA,policy of the Howard coalition government.,40
NA,That is what it took for most of its tenure in,40
NA,office.,40
NA,The truth is that we are doing what we,40
NA,need to do to save $450 million to better,40
NA,"fund our health system, our hospital system,",40
NA,"our roads, our schools and other sorts of",40
NA,things. That is what we are doing. We are not,40
NA,about punishing people who cannot have,40
NA,children. It is simply untrue for the member,40
NA,for Cook to come in here and say and imply,40
NA,that. What we are doing here is in response,40
NA,to a report that we had commissioned. Under,40
NA,the Health Legislation Amendment (Medi-,40
NA,care) Act 2004 the Minister for Health and,40
NA,Ageing tabled a report entitled the Extended,40
NA,Medicare safety net review report 2009 and it,40
NA,"looked at the effectiveness, the operation and",40
NA,the implications of the safety net with respect,40
NA,to a variety of different things. The report,40
NA,was carried out by the Centre for Health,40
NA,Economics Research and Evaluation at the,40
NA,I conUniversity of Technology in Sydney. That,40
NA,"report said a number of things, and I think",40
NA,that the report's existence and its recommen-,40
NA,dations seem to have washed over the oppo-,40
NA,sition entirely.,40
NA,The report was very clear. What we are,40
NA,trying to do here is stop doctors charging,40
NA,excessive amounts by effectively taking ad-,40
NA,vantage of the safety net. That is what the,40
NA,doctors are doing. We want to make sure the,40
NA,safety net is sustainable. The report recom-,40
NA,mended and noted a number of things which,40
NA,are very important to note. The report noted,40
NA,that the safety net had helped patients that,40
NA,had very high costs and reduced the out-of-,40
NA,pocket expenses for some patients with can-,40
NA,"cer. Nonetheless, the review showed that",40
NA,there were some real concerns in obstetrics,40
NA,"and assisted reproductive technologies, in-",40
NA,cluding IVF and other Medicare services.,40
NA,The report noted that 50 per cent of safety,40
NA,net benefits were paid to obstetrics and as-,40
NA,"sisted reproductive technologies, and the",41
NA,Medicare benefits had more than doubled for,41
NA,both of those groups since the safety net had,41
NA,been introduced.,41
NA,The reported noted that between 2003 and,41
NA,2008-and the Minister for Health and Age-,41
NA,ing has reported this in her speech-the fees,41
NA,charged for obstetricians for in-house hospi-,41
NA,tal services went down by six per cent. How-,41
NA,"ever, the fees for those obstetricians outside",41
NA,"of hospital, in private practice, and who",41
NA,charge people like the member for Cook and,41
NA,"his wife, had increased by 267 per cent. How",41
NA,can it be possible to justify increases of that,41
NA,"nature? Similarly, the fees charged for as-",41
NA,sisted reproductive technology services fell,41
NA,by nine per cent for in-house hospital ser-,41
NA,vices while the fees charged for out-of-,41
NA,hospital services increased by 62 per cent. It,41
NA,is very clear that some doctors were taking,41
NA,advantage of the safety net. It is crystal,41
NA,The figures say very clearly that it is the,41
NA,case.,41
NA,What are we going to do about it? Are we,41
NA,going to have a sustainable safety net? The,41
NA,unlimited nature of the benefits available,41
NA,through the safety net has led some doctors,41
NA,to take advantage. The truth is they knew,41
NA,that the majority of their expenses were be-,41
NA,ing paid for by the taxpayers. That is what it,41
NA,was all about. Lest anyone says that some-,41
NA,how we are opposed to the safety net and,41
NA,that somehow we are making massive,41
NA,changes that will adversely affect Austra-,41
NA,"lians, I just point out that the government is",41
NA,supportive of the safety net. The truth is that,41
NA,the safety net operates in this way. Once an,41
NA,"annual threshold has been met, Medicare",41
NA,pays 80 per cent of any future out-of-pocket,41
NA,expenses for all out-of-hospital services for,41
NA,"the remainder of that calendar year. In 2009,",41
NA,the annual threshold for concession card,41
NA,holders and people who receive family tax,41
NA,benefit part A is $555.70. For singles and,41
NA,"families the threshold is $1,111.60. That is",41
NA,indexed every year. The bill before the,41
NA,House allows the minister for health to de-,41
NA,termine by legislative instrument the maxi-,41
NA,mum increase in benefit payable under the,41
NA,safety net for specified items. These are,41
NA,items that are specified in the Medicare,41
NA,Benefit Schedule. If it is not specified it does,41
NA,not apply. The total out-of-pocket costs in-,41
NA,curred by a person for services will still,41
NA,count towards the safety net threshold,41
NA,amount. Once a person has reached that,41
NA,"threshold, they will continue to be eligible to",41
NA,"receive the benefits, equal to 80 per cent of",41
NA,"their out-of-pocket expenses, for those items",41
NA,that are not specified by legislative instru-,41
NA,ment.,41
NA,That is what is happening. We are actually,41
NA,putting a cap on certain things. We are doing,41
NA,it to maintain the integrity and sustainability,41
NA,"of the system. In 2008, expenditure on the",41
NA,"clear. safety net was $414 million, 30 per cent",41
NA,more than in 2007. Why is that? The truth is,41
NA,that doctors are charging too much. That is,41
NA,"the reality. And, if we do not do something, it",41
NA,is going to get out of control in such a way,41
NA,that the whole future operational sustainabil-,41
NA,ity of the safety net will be adversely af-,41
NA,fected. The government is not means-testing,41
NA,access to the safety net; the government is,41
NA,maintaining the safety net. The truth is that,41
NA,we are trying to get the health costs charged,41
NA,by doctors back under control.,41
NA,We are doing a lot of things when it comes,41
NA,to health and hospital services. In my elec-,41
NA,"torate, we are bringing in a GP superclinic.",41
NA,"We have announced that, and negotiations on",41
NA,that are currently underway. We are trying,41
NA,our best to ensure that we get more doctors,41
NA,in the local area. Before I was elected to this,41
NA,"place, I was on a health community council",41
NA,"for a long time, and we struggled to get more",41
NA,local doctors to the area-and Ipswich is a,41
NA,fast-growing area. It is growing at about four,41
NA,per cent per annum. It is the fastest-growing,41
NA,area in Queensland at the moment. We need,41
NA,more and more doctors and so we are seeing,42
NA,a lot more overseas-trained doctors in the,42
NA,local area. But we need to get more local,42
NA,doctors. We need to train more doctors and,42
NA,we need to spend more money locally. So the,42
NA,$450 million we are saving here will go a,42
NA,long way towards helping my community,42
NA,and helping the communities in the 150 elec-,42
NA,torates represented in this place.,42
NA,"Unlike what the member for Dickson said,",42
NA,the Rudd government is working with the,42
NA,states to improve the health and hospital sys-,42
NA,tem in this country. Through COAG we are,42
NA,putting $64 billion over five years into the,42
NA,public hospital system in this country. That is,42
NA,"an increase of $20 billion, nearly 50 per cent,",42
NA,over the previous Australian healthcare,42
NA,agreement and it is an indictment of the pre-,42
NA,vious government for letting the health and,42
NA,hospital system run down. That is the reality,42
NA,of health and hospital systems in this country,42
NA,under the Howard coalition government. We,42
NA,are also improving participation in the health,42
NA,workforce as well as increasing access to,42
NA,health care.,42
NA,One of the things that I think the govern-,42
NA,ment has done very well is the change we are,42
NA,making in relation to maternity services. The,42
NA,2009-10 budget included a great provision,42
NA,which was warmly welcomed in my elector-,42
NA,"ate, and that is funding of $120.5 million for",42
NA,maternity services. It is a reform package,42
NA,that will allow women greater choice. One of,42
NA,the most precious things a woman can ex-,42
NA,"perience in life is, of course, the birth of her",42
NA,child. My wife tells me that she will never,42
NA,"forget the birth of our child, and I will never",42
NA,forget holding my eldest daughter in my,42
NA,arms. It is a wonderful experience. We are,42
NA,not about to punish women and families in,42
NA,this regard by this legislation. We are giving,42
NA,women the option of a home birth or having,42
NA,their child in a hospital. That is their choice.,42
NA,We need to increase freedom of choice for,42
NA,women when it comes to the birth of their,42
NA,children. It is a precious and wonderful ex-,42
NA,perience.,42
NA,"So the Rudd government, through our last",42
NA,"budget, are improving the options and oppor-",42
NA,tunities for women. In this country we have a,42
NA,strong record in providing high-quality ma-,42
NA,"ternity services, and I know the women in",42
NA,"my electorate, including those in the mater-",42
NA,nity coalition groups I have met who have,42
NA,been arguing for such a long time that we,42
NA,need to improve maternity services and im-,42
NA,"prove the options for women, warmly wel-",42
NA,"come this funding. Cas MCCullough, who is",42
NA,very well known locally and a very well,42
NA,"known advocate for home births, has been",42
NA,arguing for this for a long time. I warmly,42
NA,welcome this funding. I support the legisla-,42
NA,"tion that is before the House and, once again,",42
NA,I congratulate the member for Cook and his,42
NA,wife on the birth of their second child.,42
Mrs HULL ,Riverina) (1.56 pm)-It,42
NA,would have been kind of the member for,42
NA,Blair to have taken just a little bit longer! But,42
NA,as I am now on my feet I will take the oppor-,42
NA,tunity to speak-for the three minutes before,42
NA,the debate is interrupted-on the issues be-,42
NA,fore us with this Health Insurance Amend-,42
NA,ment (Extended Medicare Safety Net) Bill,42
NA,2009.,42
The DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Ms AE,42
NA,Burke)-The member need not rush; you,42
NA,can speak when the debate is resumed if you,42
NA,want.,42
Mrs HULL,I am enormously concerned,42
NA,about some of the services that are being,42
NA,capped through this legislation. The concerns,42
NA,that I have revolve primarily around obstetric,42
NA,"services, assisted reproductive technology",42
NA,and types of cataract surgery that will be,42
NA,capped under this bill. I would also like to go,42
NA,further and speak about the concerns that I,42
NA,have that are not directly related to this bill,42
NA,"but are yet to come into this House, particu-",42
NA,larly to do with cataract surgery. While only,42
NA,one type of cataract surgery is affected by,43
NA,"this particular bill, there are significant issues",43
NA,yet to come that are associated with cataract,43
NA,"surgery in general. In particular, there is the",43
NA,decision to reduce by half the payment to,43
NA,ophthalmologists for cataract surgery. It is an,43
NA,issue that ophthalmologists will have to start,43
NA,to contend with.,43
NA,"Over the years, it seems that ophthal-",43
NA,mologists and cataract surgeons have had,43
NA,their payments cut significantly. The sched-,43
NA,ule fee for cataract surgery in the early 1980s,43
NA,was around $800. In 1996 the then govern-,43
NA,ment cut that fee by around 30 per cent. Now,43
NA,this government wants to cut that fee in half,43
NA,"again. In late 2009, I believe, the fee for",43
NA,"cataract surgery will be cut by at least half,",43
NA,and that will bring the fee for doing cataract,43
NA,surgery back to half of what it was over 25,43
NA,years ago in real dollar terms. That is still to,43

NA,MEMBER FOR HIGGINS,45
Mr TURNBULL ,Wentworth-Leader of,45
NA,"the Opposition) (2.00 pm)-On indulgence,",45
NA,"Mr Speaker, today is a momentous day in the",45
NA,history of our parliament and in the history,45
NA,"of our country. The member for Higgins, the",45
NA,"Hon. Peter Costello, has announced that he",45
NA,will renom-,45
NA,Government members interjecting-,45
Mr TURNBULL,he will not renomi-,45
NA,nate for preselection as the member for Hig-,45
NA,gins. I am pleased the members opposite are,45
NA,"so readily amused, because for 11½ years",45
NA,this country had the great gift of a Treasurer,45
NA,who took our nation from having $96 billion,45
NA,of debt to having no debt at all. He took our,45

NA,The Hon Chris Bowen MP Senator the Hon Joe Ludwig,45
NA,"are shown in bold type. As a general rule, there is",45
NA,there is a Department of Climate Change in the,45
NA,Affairs in the Defence portfolio. The title of a,45
NA,the title of a minister in all cases.,45
NA,nation from a stage where it was putting,45
NA,heavier and heavier burdens on the shoulders,45
NA,"of children and grandchildren yet to come, to",45
NA,one where it was putting money away in the,45
NA,bank in the Future Fund to relieve them of,45
NA,that burden. It was a period of unparalleled,45
NA,prosperity and unparalleled economic,45
NA,growth. And it could not have happened-it,45
NA,would never have happened-without the,45
NA,contribution of the member for Higgins.,45
NA,"If I may, in this brief moment-",45
NA,recognising that there will be many other,45
NA,occasions to acknowledge the contribution of,45
NA,the member for Higgins at greater length and,45
NA,to do him greater justice-I ask you to cast,45
NA,your minds back to his maiden speech in,46
NA,"1990, when he said:",46
NA,When we talk of creating a fairer and more com-,46
NA,"passionate society, what do we mean? Over dec-",46
NA,ades arguments have raged over which system of,46
NA,government best creates such a society. Some,46
NA,have argued that a society where government,46
NA,controls industry and controls and directs the,46
NA,production and distribution of goods is a society,46
NA,that is inherently more compassionate and fair.,46
NA,Others have argued the converse. In this century,46
NA,the argument has raged between those who be-,46
NA,"lieve that by enhancing government power it, the",46
NA,"government, can deliver fairness and compassion",46
NA,to its citizens and others who have maintained,46
NA,that in the interests of fairness the power of,46
NA,ernment itself must be curtailed and the compas-,46
NA,sionate resources of our citizens released.,46
NA,"Peter Costello, for all his years in this par-",46
NA,liament-20 years-has stood on the side of,46
NA,freedom and of enterprise. He has served our,46
NA,nation well. We salute him and we thank him,46
NA,for his service.,46
Mr RUDD ,Griffith-Prime Minister),46
NA,"(2.03 pm)- Mr Speaker, if I may I will add",46
NA,"to those remarks, on indulgence. I am ad-",46
NA,vised that the member for Higgins has indi-,46
NA,cated that he will not be seeking re-election,46
NA,"at the next federal election, nor will he be",46
NA,seeking preselection for the seat of Hig-,46
NA,"gins-a seat, of course, which we still hold",46
NA,out hopes of winning one day for the Labor,46
NA,"Party! It was a joke, Malcolm; it was a joke!",46
NA,Can I say something about what is an im-,46
NA,portant milestone in any member of parlia-,46
NA,ment's career. We enter this place with aspi-,46
NA,"rations and hopes, and all the expectations of",46
NA,"our families, our communities and ourselves",46
NA,that we bring here. It is an important day,46
NA,when you are elected to this place. Each of,46
NA,us can cast our minds back to when we first,46
NA,stood in the House of Representatives and,46
NA,the enormous pride which we felt in being,46
NA,elected and so representing our political,46
NA,party and our community.,46
NA,"There is another equally important day,",46
NA,"and that is when we choose to exit this place,",46
NA,and it should be marked appropriately as,46
NA,"well, in terms of the contributions that have",46
NA,been made to public life. And this is one,46
NA,such day in the career of a member of this,46
NA,"place-and a most notable member at that,",46
NA,the member for Higgins. To have been a,46
NA,"member of this parliament for 20 years is, of",46
NA,"itself, a significant achievement. For that, in",46
NA,"itself, the member should be commended-",46
NA,for having represented his constituency for,46
NA,"such an extended period of time. Secondly,",46
NA,for having been Treasurer of the Common-,46
NA,"govwealth for virtually 12 years is, of itself, a",46
NA,further credit to the individual member's,46
NA,talents and abilities. He would not have been,46
NA,"put in that position by his political party, nor",46
NA,"nominated by my predecessor Mr Howard,",46
NA,had confidence not been expressed in him by,46
NA,his party and by the leadership of his party in,46
NA,his considerable intellectual skills and the,46
NA,policy skills which he brings to the public,46
NA,policy debate in Australia. And for that he,46
NA,should be commended as well.,46
NA,On top of that I will add some remarks,46
NA,about his contribution to Australia's place in,46
NA,our international economic engagements,46
NA,"through the IMF and beyond. The Treasurer,",46
NA,"as he was then- Mr Costello, the member",46
NA,for Higgins-was Australia's representative,46
NA,"on the IMF and, through his occupancy of",46
NA,"that position, other international financial",46
NA,institutions for which Australia has represen-,46
NA,tation. I would make two particular points,46
NA,about the IMF. One is that in the delibera-,46
NA,tions following the Asian financial crisis in,46
NA,"1997-98, the decision at that stage to estab-",46
NA,lish the G20 finance ministers meeting was,46
NA,something in which the member for Hig-,46
NA,gins-the Treasurer as he was at the time-,46
NA,played a role.,46
NA,The establishment of the G20 finance,46
NA,"ministers meeting from that time on, and the",46
NA,"events of the last 12 months in turn, provided",46
NA,"a platform through which we, together with",47
NA,"other governments, were able to elevate it to",47
NA,a heads of government meeting. That is now,47
NA,"the G20 summit, which served this nation",47
NA,well in the meeting held in Washington at the,47
NA,"end of last year and in London most recently,",47
NA,"and will again, prospectively, in Pittsburgh",47
NA,this September. It has been an important ve-,47
NA,hicle for global economic governance. It had,47
NA,its foundations in the fact that we did have a,47
NA,body established at the finance ministers and,47
NA,treasurers level across 20 of the world's lead-,47
NA,ing economies back then. In those delibera-,47
NA,"tions at the time, the Treasurer, as he was",47
NA,"then, the member for Higgins, played a sig-",47
NA,nificant role.,47
NA,The further point I would make in that re-,47
NA,spect is that off the back of the Asian finan-,47
NA,"cial crisis at the time, significant decisions",47
NA,were made here to intervene and support,47
NA,various of our neighbouring economies that,47
NA,were experiencing difficulties-from mem-,47
NA,"ory, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Republic of",47
NA,Korea. Decisions were taken by the then,47
NA,"government, led by the Treasurer, as he was",47
NA,"then, to provide significant offers of financial",47
NA,assistance to assist those economies through,47
NA,that difficult time. These were correct deci-,47
NA,sions in the national interest. They were cor-,47
NA,rect decisions as good neighbours of these,47
NA,"countries. And they were correct decisions, I",47
NA,"would remind the House, which are not for-",47
NA,gotten today. The fact that we have good re-,47
NA,lations with the countries which I have just,47
NA,listed is in part anchored by decisions taken,47
NA,"back then, and I would like to make appro-",47
NA,priate recognition of that in the House today.,47
NA,I will make one final point about the im-,47
NA,portance of family in a place like this. The,47
NA,nearly 20 years that the member for Higgins,47
NA,has been in this House-as other members,47
NA,who have been here for an extended period,47
NA,of time will understand-has obviously been,47
NA,"an extraordinary burden for his wife, his",47
NA,"partner, as well as his children to bear. That",47
NA,is a burden which those of us who have been,47
NA,here for some time fully recognise and un-,47
NA,derstand.,47
NA,"I would say to the member for Higgins, on",47
NA,behalf of his confreres and great mates here,47
NA,"in the Australian Labor Party, that we wish",47
NA,"him well and we wish his family well, after",47
NA,what has been a quite extraordinary career in,47
NA,Australian public life.,47
Mr COSTELLO ,Higgins) (2.09 pm)-,47
NA,"On indulgence, Mr Speaker, may I say I did",47
NA,not think I would ever see the day where,47
NA,both sides of this parliament would say nice,47
NA,things about me! It is just possible that both,47
NA,sides of the dispatch box are happy with the,47
NA,announcement that I have made. I want to,47
NA,"thank both the Leader of the Liberal Party,",47
NA,"Malcolm Turnbull, and the Prime Minister,",47
NA,"Mr Rudd, for their very kind words.",47
NA,Woody Allen was once asked what he,47
NA,"hoped to hear people say at his funeral, and",47
NA,"he said, ‘As I'm lying there at my funeral I",47
NA,"would hope to hear somebody say, “Look,",47
NA,he's still moving!”' It is a very nice thing to,47
NA,"come here, not being quite departed, and",47
NA,hear the kinds of speeches one usually only,47
NA,"hears as eulogies. In fact, I might come back",47
NA,"tomorrow for a little more, I am enjoying it",47
NA,so much!,47
NA,"The Prime Minister, rightly, I think, talked",47
NA,about Australia's role in the formation of the,47
NA,G20. The G20 would not have happened,47
NA,without Australia. It brought together the,47
NA,"developed world and the developing world,",47
NA,and Australia as neither-we came in as an,47
NA,honest broker because we stood in Asia's,47
NA,"hour of need as the only country, along with",47
NA,"Japan, that came to the rescue of those crisis",47
NA,"affected economies. I do not need to say that,",47
NA,"from our perspective, a seat at the table",47
NA,which represents 90 per cent of global GDP,47
NA,"is a very, very important diplomatic position",47
NA,for us and for our country. It has moved up a,47
NA,notch now with the leader's summit. I think,47
NA,the role that it played when it was convened,48
NA,by President Bush and also by Prime Minis-,48
NA,ter Gordon Brown shows just how important,48
NA,it is. I do think that this is something Austra-,48
NA,lia must never let go of. There will be others,48
NA,that will try and refashion a G-something,48
NA,"else-a G8, a G7, a G13, a G14. Bear in",48
NA,mind the G20 is a forum where Australia can,48
NA,"play a role, and it always has. We have",48
NA,chaired it; we have hosted it here in Austra-,48
NA,"lia. It will be integral, I think, to the shape",48
NA,the future global economy.,48
NA,I thank the Leader of the Opposition for,48
NA,mentioning our achievements in the eco-,48
NA,"nomic sphere. Of course, those on the other",48
NA,"side will not want to refer to them as much,",48
NA,"for obvious reasons, but I will make one",48
NA,point. It is a point I have actually made in the,48
NA,new chapter of the forthcoming paperback,48
NA,edition of my book. I do not know if I men-,48
NA,"tioned that the hardback copy has sold out,",48
NA,and we are publishing a paperback edition,48
NA,with a new chapter. The point I have made is,48
NA,that the strength of Australia's position in,48
NA,terms of its debt-to-GDP ratio has nothing to,48
NA,do with the journey in the last year but eve-,48
NA,rything to do with the starting point. If we,48
NA,had not had a starting point of a net negative,48
NA,"debt-that is, an asset position-then our",48
NA,debt position would be ending up where the,48
NA,"Europeans, the Americans and the British",48
NA,are. It was the strength of the starting point,48
NA,that gave Australia ammunition that could be,48
NA,unloaded and unlocked in the current situa-,48
NA,tion. Every now and then it is worth paying,48
NA,credit to the people who put in place impor-,48
NA,tant reforms before your time. None of us,48
NA,come to politics in the year zero. There is,48
NA,always something that has gone on before. I,48
NA,"have always paid credit, because I think they",48
NA,"were right, to Hawke and Keating for the",48
NA,liberalisation of the financial markets and the,48
NA,"cutting of tariffs, and there are things that we",48
NA,"could also be given credit for, I think, by the",48
NA,current government. It will make Australia,48
NA,stronger if we do that.,48
NA,In that maiden speech that I gave so many,48
NA,years ago I said these words: ‘I believe in the,48
NA,"parliament.' And I do, and, although it was",48
NA,my privilege to be a minister for a very long,48
NA,"period of time, the parliament is still impor-",48
NA,tant. There is no person in this place that is,48
NA,not important. Everybody had something that,48
NA,got them here and got them elected and eve-,48
NA,of rybody has a view that has to be listened to.,48
NA,We are lucky to have a parliament. That is,48
NA,why I very consciously decided after the,48
NA,election that I would stay in the parliament-,48
NA,because the parliament is an institution that,48
NA,"should be preserved and valued, not just the",48
NA,ministry. It has been my privilege to be in,48
NA,this parliament for 20 years-what I consider,48
NA,the best years of my life.,48
NA,I also want to say I think Australia's best,48
NA,years can still be in front of it. This is still a,48
NA,young country with wonderful opportunity,48
NA,"and, properly governed, there are greater",48
NA,things in store for us.,48
NA,The Prime Minister was very generous in,48
NA,his words. I thank him for those words. On,48
NA,this occasion he did not come the raw prawn;,48
NA,he gave a fair suck of the sauce bottle! And I,48
NA,appreciate the statement that he gave.,48
NA,Family means everything to me. You can-,48
NA,not imagine the strength that a strong family,48
NA,gives a person. I thank my family and my,48
NA,"colleagues, my branch members and my",48
NA,electorate committee for everything they,48
NA,have given me. It has been an honour and a,48
NA,privilege to serve in this parliament.,48
NA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,48
NA,Interest Rates,48
Mr TURNBULL ,2.15 pm)-My ques-,48
NA,tion is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the,48
NA,Commonwealth Bank's claim that its recent,48
NA,rate rise was caused by an increase in its own,48
NA,long-term wholesale borrowing costs. Given,48
NA,the increase in long-term rates is directly,49
NA,related to the massive explosion in govern-,49
NA,"ment debt, doesn't the Prime Minister accept",49
NA,that it is his reckless spending and debt binge,49
NA,which is pushing up interest rates?,49
Mr RUDD,I thank the Leader of the,49
NA,Opposition for his question. Let's go to the,49
NA,facts of what the Commonwealth Bank actu-,49
NA,ally said. They said:,49
NA,The cheaper funding we had … prior to the,49
NA,crisis is rolling off and is being replaced by,49
NA,more expensive source of funding.,49
NA,The cost of raising funds from offshore whole-,49
NA,sale markets was still 12 times higher than it was,49
NA,before the credit crisis.,49
NA,That is: offshore.,49
NA,Mr Hockey interjecting-,49
Mr RUDD,Let me go to the issue of,49
NA,"offshore wholesale markets. Firstly, the cost",49
NA,"of bank finance, as the member for North",49
NA,"Sydney would be aware, is set in offshore",49
NA,"global markets. Presently, in offshore bond",49
NA,markets we have something like $84 trillion,49
NA,on issue. The fraction of that which the Aus-,49
NA,"tralian bond market, the Australian debt mar-",49
NA,"ket, issues is 0.001. That is fact 1. Let us just",49
NA,put that into some context.,49
NA,"Secondly, the honourable member asks",49
NA,about the impact of Australian government,49
NA,actions in relation to rates. Can I say that one,49
NA,of the principal decisions taken by the gov-,49
NA,"ernment, for which we were criticised by",49
NA,"many of those opposite, was the decision to",49
NA,provide a guarantee on interbank lending in,49
NA,the wholesale finance market to banks.,49
NA,I would draw the honourable member's at-,49
NA,tention to the following. On 12 December,49
NA,2008 the CBA issued guaranteed bonds at a,49
NA,"total price, including the 70 basis point guar-",49
NA,"antee price, of 160 basis points above the",49
NA,bank bill swap rate. As of 14 April 2009-,49
NA,"that is, after the government's guarantee",49
NA,came into operation-the spread on the CBA,49
NA,"issue was down to 123 basis points. In fact, if",49
NA,you look more broadly at the impact on,49
NA,money market spreads as a consequence of,49
NA,the government's direct intervention in the,49
NA,marketplace to support banks with the inter-,49
NA,"bank guarantee, it runs as follows: following",49
NA,the collapse of Lehman Brothers the spread,49
NA,increased to 142 basis points; after the gov-,49
NA,ernment introduced the guarantees credit,49
NA,spreads had fallen to 80 basis points by the,49
NA,"end of November, to 75 basis points by the",49
NA,"this end of December, to 34 basis points by the",49
NA,end of March and to 21 basis points by the,49
NA,end of May. I would suggest that the honour-,49
NA,able member reflects on that in terms of the,49
NA,basis of his question as well.,49
NA,The other thing I would draw to the hon-,49
NA,ourable member's attention is the relevance,49
NA,of the government's actions in the market-,49
NA,place to support the interbank guarantee in,49
NA,terms of the banks actual take-up of this,49
NA,guarantee in their international borrowing.,49
NA,And I would draw the honourable member's,49
NA,"attention to the fact that, in the crisis period",49
NA,"of October-November last year, interbank",49
NA,lending effectively collapsed to virtually,49
NA,"zero. In fact, the total raisings by Australian",49
NA,banks in November last year were $0.14 bil-,49
NA,"lion-that is, practically zero. After we in-",49
NA,troduced the guarantee-which came into,49
NA,"operation, from recollection, Treasurer, in",49
NA,early December-we had those raisings in-,49
NA,"crease to $23 billion, $28 billion, $19 billion,",49
NA,$8 billion et cetera.,49
NA,But here is the critical point for the benefit,49
NA,of the honourable member who has asked the,49
NA,question: the extent to which the banks have,49
NA,relied upon the guarantee for their actual,49
NA,raisings. In December last year 98 per cent of,49
NA,the overall raisings by the banks were under-,49
NA,pinned by the government guarantee; in Feb-,49
NA,"ruary it was 93 per cent, in March it was 86",49
NA,"per cent, in April it was 65 per cent and in",49
NA,May it was 53 per cent. In terms of the nor-,49
NA,"malisation of credit markets-that is, assist-",49
NA,ing banks to raise money offshore-from,49
NA,where we had collapsed to zero in November,50
NA,"last year, we have had a restoration to these",50
NA,"levels of raisings. Most critically, more then",50
NA,"half since then-and, in the early months,",50
NA,practically all-have depended upon the,50
NA,"government guarantee, producing the con-",50
NA,traction in spreads that I referred to before.,50
NA,"Therefore, I would suggest to the honour-",50
NA,able member as to the basis of his question:,50
NA,(1) Australia's public bond issue represents a,50
NA,fraction of 0.001 of the total bond issue,50
NA,which is alive globally-and it is the global,50
NA,bond market that shapes the offshore finan-,50
NA,cial markets which determine credit price (2),50
NA,spreads have changed and (3) banks have,50
NA,relied upon the actions of this government.,50
NA,"Finally, I ask the honourable member who",50
NA,has asked this question about interest rates,50
NA,simply reflect on where interest rates stood,50
NA,under the previous government as opposed to,50
NA,where they stand under this government.,50
NA,Under the previous government we had 10,50
NA,interest rates rises in a row-a total rise of,50
NA,"250 basis points, costing an average family",50
NA,more than $400 per month-and interest,50
NA,rates were at their highest point in a decade.,50
NA,That is what we inherited. I would contrast,50
NA,that with those opposite in the following,50
NA,way: since the government have been in of-,50
NA,fice families have benefited from six interest,50
NA,rate cuts-a total of 425 basis points-and,50
NA,interest rates are now at their lowest point in,50
NA,"more than 50 years, which will save the av-",50
NA,"erage family with a $300,000 mortgage",50
NA,"around $750 a month, or $9,000 a year. So I",50
NA,suggest to the honourable member that he,50
NA,look at some basic comparisons. Let us look,50
NA,at where the CBA rate stood when the Liber-,50
NA,als left office-at 8.55 per cent. Where does,50
NA,it stand today? At 5.74 per cent. That repre-,50
NA,sents a fundamental difference between in-,50
NA,terest rates as the existed under the previous,50
NA,government and where they exist today.,50
NA,"Therefore, I would suggest to the honour-",50
NA,"able gentlemen that, when he poses questions",50
NA,"like this, he reflect upon (a) interest rate per-",50
NA,formance under the previous government,50
NA,relative to what is occurring now (b) how,50
NA,interest rates and the cost of capital are actu-,50
NA,"ally shaped by offshore credit markets, as",50
NA,underpinned in the correct rendering of the,50
NA,statement by the CBA and (c) the impact that,50
NA,the government guarantee has had on spreads,50
NA,and on the actual uptake of interbank lending,50
NA,courtesy of the government's provision of,50
NA,"that guarantee, which was much criticised.",50
NA,I will conclude by saying this: as those,50
NA,opposite talk about the impact of the 10 basis,50
NA,point rise by the Commonwealth Bank of,50
NA,"Australia, on which point the Treasurer and I",50
NA,to and others have reflected the government's,50
NA,"fundamental disappointment, those opposite,",50
NA,and the Leader of the Opposition in particu-,50
NA,"lar, should reflect carefully on what he had to",50
NA,say when there was a 25 basis point rise not,50
NA,all that long ago. When interest rates went up,50
NA,in August 2006 by 25 basis points the Leader,50
NA,"of the Opposition said at the time, ‘I think",50
NA,the interest rate hike has been overdrama-,50
NA,"tised.' Furthermore, on the question of inter-",50
NA,"est rates, the Leader of the Opposition has",50
NA,also said much more recently-I think as,50
NA,shadow Treasurer:,50
NA,Banks are free to price their products as they,50
NA,"wish. After all, they are in the business of making",50
NA,"profits and, all things being equal, they will",50
NA,charge as much for every product they have on,50
NA,offer as the market will allow them.,50
NA,That is obviously the philosophy-the free,50
NA,market fundamentalist philosophy-,50
NA,represented by the Leader of the Opposition.,50
NA,He says that that is what occurs out there in,50
NA,interest rate markets. I would suggest that the,50
NA,Leader of the Opposition reflect carefully (a),50
NA,on what he has said about how interest rate,50
NA,markets operate (b) on the relative perform-,50
NA,ance of interest rate pricing and cost under,50
NA,the government of which he was a part for,50
NA,such a long period of time as compared to,51
NA,what applies now and (c) how actual prices,51
NA,are set.,51
NA,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,51
The SPEAKER ,2.24 pm)-I inform the,51
NA,House that we have present in the gallery,51
NA,this afternoon the Minister for Foreign Af-,51
NA,fairs and Cooperation of the government of,51
NA,"the Republic of Rwanda, the Hon. Mrs",51
NA,Rosemary Museminali and also the Minister,51
NA,for Foreign Affairs of the government of the,51
NA,"Republic of Kenya, the Hon. Moses Wetan-",51
NA,gula. On behalf of the House I extend to both,51
NA,of you a very warm welcome.,51
NA,"Honourable members-Hear, hear!",51
NA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,51
NA,Economy,51
Mr CHEESEMAN ,2.24 pm)-My ques-,51
NA,tion is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime,51
NA,Minister update the House on the govern-,51
NA,ment's nation building for recovery program,51
NA,to drive Australia out of the worst global,51
NA,cession in 75 years?,51
Mr RUDD,I thank the honourable,51
NA,member for this question. The government,51
NA,has embarked on a course of action based on,51
NA,early and decisive action to support jobs and,51
NA,to cushion our economy from the worst im-,51
NA,pacts of the global recession.,51
NA,I refer the attention of the House to what,51
NA,we had produced in the last week in terms of,51
NA,"the most recent consumer sentiment index,",51
NA,which was up 12 per cent in June. This is the,51
NA,largest increase in 22 years. Consumer sen-,51
NA,timent is now up 20 per cent since the an-,51
NA,nouncement of the government's first eco-,51
NA,"nomic stimulus package in October and, fur-",51
NA,"thermore, the consumer sentiment index is",51
NA,now at its highest level since January 2008.,51
NA,"That covers consumer sentiment, but then, of",51
NA,"course, we have business confidence, which",51
NA,has also risen. Business confidence for May,51
NA,showed the sharpest rise that we have seen,51
NA,since 1989. It has now reached its highest,51
NA,"level since February 2008. Furthermore, we",51
NA,saw other positive economic data in the,51
NA,"housing sector, with housing finance grow-",51
NA,ing by 3.5 per cent in April. First home buy-,51
NA,ers in particular represent an increased pro-,51
NA,"portion of that total amount, indicating that",51
NA,people are responding positively to the treb-,51
NA,ling of the first home owners boost.,51
NA,I was asked by the honourable member,51
NA,"about the economic recovery-that is, our",51
NA,efforts to support an economic recovery in,51
NA,Australia and to lift Australia from the global,51
NA,economic recession. The data suggests that,51
NA,as of now-while there are still many diffi-,51
NA,culties lying ahead-Australia is performing,51
NA,better than most other countries during this,51
NA,"global recession, the worst in three-quarters",51
NA,"of a century. Firstly, on the matter of eco-",51
NA,"nomic growth, if you look at the data itself,",51
NA,Australia has the fastest growth in the,51
NA,OECD. In the March quarter we saw the fol-,51
NA,relowing growth in some other economies:,51
NA,"Japan, negative 3.8 per cent; the UK, nega-",51
NA,"tive 1.9 per cent; the US, negative 1.5 per",51
NA,"cent; Canada, negative 1.4 per cent; France,",51
NA,"negative 1.2 per cent; Germany, negative 3.8",51
NA,"per cent; Italy, negative 2.6 per cent; and",51
NA,Australia grew in the March quarter by 0.4,51
NA,per cent. Against those measures the Austra-,51
NA,lian economy is performing relatively well.,51
NA,"On unemployment, Australia on the most",51
NA,recent data has the second lowest unem-,51
NA,ployment of the major advanced economies:,51
NA,"in the UK it is 7.1 per cent; the US, 9.4 per",51
NA,"cent; Canada, 8.4 per cent; France, 9.1 per",51
NA,"cent; Germany, 8.2 per cent; Italy, 6.9 per",51
NA,cent; in Australia it is 5.7 per cent-still too,51
NA,high-and in Japan it is 5 per cent.,51
NA,"On debt, Australia has the lowest net debt",51
NA,of the major advanced economies. To again,51
NA,"go through the numbers: Japan, 103 per cent",51
NA,"of GDP; the UK, 56.8 per cent; the US, 61.7",51
NA,"per cent; Canada, 26.2 per cent; France, 65.2",51
NA,"per cent; Germany, 70.9 per cent; Italy, 111.9",52
NA,per cent; and the major economies have an,52
NA,average of 70.4 per cent of GDP. Australia's,52
NA,debt is currently forecast to be 4.6 per cent,52
NA,2009-10 rising to 13.8 per cent.,52
NA,"On the matters of deficits, Australia has a",52
NA,lower budget deficit than the average of the,52
NA,major advanced economies in 2009. The fig-,52
NA,"ures are: Japan, minus 9.9 per cent; the UK,",52
NA,"9.8 per cent; the US, 13.6 per cent; France,",52
NA,"6.2 per cent; Germany, 4.7 per cent; Italy, 5.5",52
NA,per cent; and their average is 10.4 per cent.,52
NA,Canada is at minus 3.4 per cent and Australia,52
NA,is at minus 4.9 per cent.,52
NA,NA,52
NA,down?,52
Mr RUDD,The member for Sturt is ob-,52
NA,viously not keen on hearing this data. But it,52
NA,is important that the House reflect on the fact,52
NA,that every one of the major advanced,52
NA,economies has fallen into recession and Aus-,52
NA,"tralia has not. I say to those opposite that,",52
NA,"therefore, when it comes to economic",52
NA,"growth, Australia is the fastest among the",52
NA,major advanced economies and with unem-,52
NA,ployment we have the second lowest of the,52
NA,major advanced economies. On top of that,52
NA,our net debt is the lowest of the major ad-,52
NA,vanced economies and our deficit is the low-,52
NA,est of the average of the major advanced,52
NA,economies. These are the data which repre-,52
NA,sent the impact not just of government policy,52
NA,action but also of the decisive contribution,52
NA,by individuals in the Australian economy as,52
NA,well-the men and women of business and,52
NA,small business in particular.,52
NA,"We have some 35,000 construction pro-",52
NA,jects currently underway across the country.,52
NA,These are important projects for the nation. I,52
NA,notice in this respect that there is a debate,52
NA,within the Australian community about the,52
NA,future of the nation's construction sector. The,52
NA,building and construction sector is critical,52
NA,for the economy. While this sector is full of,52
NA,hardworking and law-abiding people helping,52
NA,"Australia to build towards recovery, there are",52
NA,also plainly problems. There has been a his-,52
NA,in tory of violence and threats of violence in,52
NA,parts of this sector and these cannot be ig-,52
NA,nored and nor will they be ignored. There is,52
NA,a determination within the Australian gov-,52
NA,ernment to get this right. We will honour our,52
NA,election commitments and have indeed a,52
NA,tough cop on the beat. We will honour this,52
NA,commitment in a fair and responsible way,52
NA,"for the sector, for the economy and also,",52
NA,"most importantly, to support economic re-",52
NA,covery.,52
NA,We are not out of the woods yet. There is,52
NA,much work to be done. The government's,52
NA,strategy is to lift the economy up through,52
NA,nation building for recovery. I would again,52
NA,contrast that with the strategy embraced by,52
NA,"those opposite, which is to continue to talk",52
NA,the economy down.,52
NA,Budget,52
Mr HOCKEY ,2.30 pm)-My question,52
NA,is to the Treasurer. I refer to the govern-,52
NA,ment's claim that its massive debt burden is,52
NA,responsible for job creation and has nothing,52
NA,at all to do with rising interest rates. Will the,52
NA,Treasurer now release all Treasury modelling,52
NA,that is used to justify his claims that this,52
NA,huge taxpayer debt is supporting jobs?,52
Mr SWAN,I thank the shadow Treasurer,52
NA,for his question. He is acutely embarrassed,52
NA,by the jobs performance of our stimulus,52
NA,package. It is playing a vital role in support-,52
NA,ing employment in the Australian economy.,52
NA,Both he and the Leader of the Opposition,52
NA,were acutely embarrassed when the national,52
NA,accounts figures came out the week before,52
NA,"last, because what they showed was that it",52
NA,"was our stimulus that was promoting growth,",52
NA,employment and business in the Australian,52
NA,community.,52
NA,"When you listen to the shadow Treasurer,",52
NA,you would think that there was some alterna-,52
NA,tive. We have this dishonest campaign about,53
NA,deficits and borrowing when the truth is that,53
NA,we know that they would borrow not one,53
NA,cent less than us and that they would not pay,53
NA,it back one day earlier. We know that. Last,53
NA,"Sunday week, there was an embarrassing",53
NA,performance by the shadow Treasurer with,53
NA,Laurie Oakes. Laurie Oakes asked him this:,53
NA,"But, if you'd been in government, you also would",53
NA,have lost $210 billion from your forward esti-,53
NA,"mates wouldn't you? So, do you concede that you",53
NA,would have had to borrow that amount if you,53
NA,were in government?,53
NA,The shadow Treasurer replied:,53
NA,"No way Laurie, no way.",53
NA,What a completely ridiculous claim: ‘There's,53
NA,no global recession; it has no impact on the,53
NA,"revenues. No way, Laurie; no loss of revenue",53
NA,at all.' Laurie Oakes went on to ask him this,53
NA,very obvious question:,53
NA,So you'd be spending $210 billion less over that,53
NA,period?,53
NA,The shadow Treasurer replied:,53
NA,"No, no, not at all.",53
NA,NA,53
NA,of order on relevance. The question very,53
NA,specifically asked whether the Treasurer,53
NA,would release the Treasury modelling that,53
NA,they use to justify their job creation claims.,53
NA,Even the Treasurer must recognise that his,53
NA,answer is ranging a long way from the ques-,53
NA,tion that he was asked.,53
The SPEAKER,The Manager of Oppo-,53
NA,sition Business will resume his seat. The pre-,53
NA,"amble of the question related to debt levels,",53
NA,job creation and interest rates.,53
Mr SWAN,Exactly. And it relates to the,53
NA,level of borrowings that this government has,53
NA,had to make responsibly to support our,53
NA,economy and to support employment in the,53
NA,middle of a global recession. Mr Oakes said:,53
NA,So you'd be spending $210 billion less over that,53
NA,period?,53
NA,Hockey said:,53
NA,"No, no, not at all.",53
NA,"So there would be no global recession, they",53
NA,would have less deficit and debt and they,53
NA,would be able to do that without spending a,53
NA,cent less. Talk about a magic pudding!,53
NA,The truth is that we have had to borrow,53
NA,responsibly to cover the revenue collapse,53
NA,brought on in this country-imposed on this,53
NA,country-by a global recession and to sup-,53
NA,port employment to give us the outcomes,53
NA,that we got in the national accounts the week,53
NA,before last and to give us the consumer con-,53
NA,fidence figures that the Prime Minister was,53
NA,talking about before.,53
NA,"Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a",53
NA,point of order on relevance. I just asked the,53
NA,Treasurer to release the basis of his claims.,53
NA,Just release it; he uses it all the time. Just,53
NA,release it.,53
The SPEAKER,The member for North,53
NA,Sydney will resume his seat. As I suggested,53
NA,"to the member for Sturt, the Treasurer is re-",53
NA,sponding to the question.,53
Mr SWAN,What we saw in the embar-,53
NA,rassment on Laurie Oakes's program is that,53
NA,there is no alternative policy. None of,53
NA,them-not one of the entire frontbench-has,53
NA,an alternative policy. All they have is a dis-,53
NA,honest scare campaign about deficit and,53
NA,debt. It is about time that they came clean,53
NA,and admitted that if they were in government,53
NA,they would have to borrow as much as the,53
NA,government has had to borrow to support,53
NA,employment in the Australian economy. But,53
NA,they are so opportunistic. They are so con-,53
NA,cerned with their own political futures that,53
NA,they are not concerned with the national in-,53
NA,terest. We published for everybody to see in,53
NA,our budget all of our figures; all of our esti-,53
NA,mates. Because they are inconvenient for,53
NA,"their fake political position, they cannot wear",53
NA,them.,53
NA,"On this side of the House, we are proud of",54
NA,the budget that we brought down. We are,54
NA,proud of the role that it is playing in supportbeen,54
NA,"ing employment. There are 200,000 more",54
NA,Australians in employment as a consequence,54
NA,"of our budget. That is 200,000-plus people in",54
NA,employment who would not have been in,54
NA,employment if it had not been for our,54
NA,budget. That is their embarrassment; that is,54
NA,what they cannot admit to. That is why their,54
NA,dishonest campaign is there for everybody to,54
NA,see.,54
NA,Building the Education Revolution,54
NA,Program,54
Ms BIRD ,2.36 pm)-My question is to,54
NA,"the Minister for Education, Minister for Em-",54
NA,ployment and Workplace Relations and Min-,54
NA,ister for Social Inclusion. Will the Deputy,54
NA,Prime Minister update the House on recent,54
NA,media reports about the Building the Educa-,54
NA,tion Revolution program?,54
Ms GILLARD,I thank the member for,54
NA,Cunningham for her question. I know that,54
NA,she would be very delighted that jobs in her,54
NA,local economy are being supported through,54
NA,the economic stimulus plan. There are over,54
NA,"1,133 projects in her electorate, and 87 of",54
NA,these projects are at 61 of her local schools,54
NA,under the Building the Education Revolution,54
NA,program. This contribution in Cunningham is,54
NA,part of the biggest school modernisation pro-,54
NA,gram the nation has ever seen. Over the next,54
NA,"12 months there will be 23,000 projects in",54
NA,"about 9,500 schools around the country-a",54
NA,huge national effort to support jobs today,54
NA,whilst we build the infrastructure we need,54
NA,for tomorrow.,54
NA,"Mr Speaker, you and others in the House",54
NA,may have seen some recent publicity about,54
NA,the guidelines for the Building the Education,54
NA,Revolution and some claims relating to ex-,54
NA,penditure in particular schools. Can I make,54
NA,this position very clear for the House: the,54
NA,guidelines for the Building the Education,54
NA,Revolution are clear; they are available pub-,54
NA,licly on the website; and they have certainly,54
NA,absorbed by school communities who,54
NA,want to benefit their schools under this pro-,54
NA,"gram. In particular, the Building the Educa-",54
NA,tion Revolution guidelines have required,54
NA,"that, wherever it is possible, local tradespeo-",54
NA,ple are engaged for the work. Preference,54
NA,must also be given to businesses that have,54
NA,demonstrated a commitment to adding or,54
NA,retaining trainees and apprentices. The,54
NA,"guidelines also state that, wherever possible,",54
NA,new buildings and refurbishments should,54
NA,incorporate sustainable building principles,54
NA,and be designed to maximise energy effi-,54
NA,"ciency. The guidelines are also clear that, for",54
NA,"planned amalgamations, the indicative fund-",54
NA,ing allocation for the school to be merged,54
NA,can be combined and used for capital or re-,54
NA,furbishments in the new school. We are,54
NA,working cooperatively with state and terri-,54
NA,tory authorities and with the independent and,54
NA,Catholic school systems to deliver this huge,54
NA,modernisation program.,54
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,54
Ms GILLARD,The opposition are cat-,54
NA,calling about this because they do not sup-,54
NA,port and have never supported this invest-,54
NA,"ment in schools. Mr Speaker, you may have",54
NA,"seen, as other members of the parliament",54
NA,"may have seen, some very specific claims",54
NA,"made on 12 June in the Australian, where it",54
NA,was alleged that funding was being handed,54
NA,to schools slated for closure or amalgama-,54
NA,tion.,54
NA,NA,54
Ms GILLARD,I hear the shadow min-,54
NA,ister yell out ‘Gepps Cross'. I am coming to,54
NA,"that in just a moment, and he will be very",54
NA,"interested in the facts. Firstly, the guidelines",54
NA,in relation to schools that are due to be,54
NA,closed or amalgamated are clear-,54
NA,NA,54
The SPEAKER,The member for Sturt!,54
Ms GILLARD,The member for Sturt,55
NA,"will be very interested in the answer, given",55
NA,his interjections. He should just wait one,55
NA,little minute and some things will become,55
NA,clear to him. The guidelines are clear in rela-,55
NA,tion to schools that are due to be closed or,55
NA,amalgamated.,55
NA,NA,55
The SPEAKER,The member for Sturt,55
NA,should wait quietly.,55
Ms GILLARD,No funding is going to,55
NA,"schools that are in the process of, or were",55
NA,"planned for, closure. The guidelines in this",55
NA,respect are exactly the same as those of the,55
NA,Investing in Our Schools guidelines-,55
NA,"exactly the same. Of course, states and terri-",55
NA,tories and block grant authorities were asked,55
NA,to advise the Commonwealth of any schools,55
NA,earmarked for closure when they provided,55
NA,their enrolment data to the Commonwealth,55
NA,in February 2009. In some cases when we,55
NA,published the names of successful schools,55
NA,under the Building the Education Revolu-,55
NA,"tion, the state, in their application, named",55
NA,school that was amalgamating. Let me just,55
NA,"make the facts very, very clear-so clear that",55
NA,the opposition-,55
NA,NA,55
Ms GILLARD,The member for Sturt,55
NA,"will now be very interested in this fact, and",55
NA,he will come to the dispatch box and no,55
NA,doubt apologise for that interjection. Let me,55
NA,make the facts very clear. The Australian,55
NA,reported on 12 June that Inala West State,55
NA,"School, which is amalgamating with Inala",55
NA,"State School, would be receiving $125,000",55
NA,"for classroom upgrades. The fact is that, as",55
NA,Inala West State School is to be closed and,55
NA,"amalgamated with Inala State School, 100",55
NA,per cent of the funding will go to Inala State,55
NA,School-the continuing school-for class-,55
NA,room upgrades. The Australian reported on,55
NA,"12 June that Richlands State School, which is",55
NA,amalgamating with Richlands East State,55
NA,"School, would be receiving $75,000 for",55
NA,classroom upgrades. The fact is that 100 per,55
NA,cent of this funding will go to Richlands East,55
NA,State School-the school that is continuing.,55
NA,The Australian reported on 12 June that Din-,55
NA,"more State School, which is amalgamating",55
NA,"with Riverview State School, would be re-",55
NA,"ceiving $75,000 for classroom upgrades. The",55
NA,fact is that 100 per cent of this funding will,55
NA,go to Riverview State School-the school,55
NA,that is continuing. The Australian reported,55
NA,"on 12 June that Bremer State High School,",55
NA,"which is moving to a new site, would be re-",55
NA,"ceiving $200,000 for revegetation and a fit-",55
NA,ness track. The fact is that these facilities are,55
NA,for the new site. The Australian reported on,55
NA,12 June-,55
NA,NA,55
The SPEAKER,The member for Sturt!,55
Ms GILLARD,and I am sure the,55
NA,shadow minister will be interested in this-,55
NA,"that Gepps Cross Primary School, before it",55
NA,merges into a new superschool in 18 months,55
NA,"the time, will be receiving $125,000 to be spent",55
NA,on fixing a toilet block. The fact is that the,55
NA,Building the Education Revolution funds for,55
NA,Gepps Cross Primary School were approved,55
NA,for information and communication technol-,55
NA,ogy at the amalgamated site and the funds,55
NA,will be used for this purpose. The South Aus-,55
NA,tralian Department of Education and Chil-,55
NA,dren's Services has advised my department,55
NA,that the school will not be using any Build-,55
NA,ing the Education Revolution funds to fix,55
NA,toilets and drainage and that any mainte-,55
NA,nance for toilets and drainage would be,55
NA,funded by the state government. The fact,55
NA,here-,55
NA,NA,55
The SPEAKER,The member for Sturt,55
NA,is warned!,55
Ms GILLARD,Obviously the shadow,55
NA,"minister for education, caring nothing about",55
NA,"education, does not want to listen to the an-",55
NA,swer-and the facts are perfectly clear.,56
NA,These vital resources are being delivered to,56
NA,schools which are continuing and which will,56
NA,educate students. The members of the oppo-,56
NA,sition might think that is something to be,56
NA,laughed about; they might think that building,56
NA,21st century infrastructure for Australian,56
NA,schools is all a bit of joke; they might,56
NA,is appropriate to come into this House and,56
NA,vote against it; they might think it is appro-,56
NA,priate to go on the media and describe it as a,56
NA,low-quality spend; and then they might have,56
NA,the hypocrisy to try and get themselves in the,56
NA,photo when these funds are announced at,56
NA,local schools. But the Australian community,56
NA,know that this program is benefiting local,56
NA,"schools, building the infrastructure they need",56
NA,for the 21st century and supporting local,56
NA,jobs.,56
NA,This is a huge national mobilisation ef-,56
NA,fort-$14.7 billion is unashamedly being,56
NA,delivered quickly to support jobs today dur-,56
NA,ing the global recession. People of goodwill,56
NA,around the country are turning their hands to,56
NA,make sure that this money is delivered in the,56
NA,form of construction sites and that it supports,56
NA,jobs right around the country. We will con-,56
NA,tinue to work with those people of goodwill.,56
NA,We understand that from time to time in a,56
NA,program of this size there will be complaints,56
NA,and concerns. We have responded to a num-,56
NA,ber of those. All we ask in the course of this,56
NA,process is that people of goodwill continue to,56
NA,"work together to get the program delivered,",56
NA,"and obviously we would prefer if, when re-",56
NA,"porting on these matters, there was some",56
NA,accuracy in the reports.,56
Mr TURNBULL ,2.45 pm)-My ques-,56
NA,tion is addressed to the Prime Minister. I re-,56
NA,"fer the Prime Minister to Mr John Grant,",56
NA,who has supplied him with a free car for al-,56
NA,most all of the time he has been Leader of,56
NA,"the Labor Party, and to the Prime Minister's",56
NA,answer in question time-,56
NA,Government members interjecting-,56
NA,Ms Gillard-Is that your big attack on,56
NA,the economy?,56
The SPEAKER,Order! The Leader of,56
NA,think it the Opposition has the call.,56
Mr TURNBULL,"Thank you, Mr",56
NA,"Speaker, I will start again. I refer the Prime",56
NA,"Minister to Mr John Grant, who has supplied",56
NA,him with a free car for almost all of the time,56
NA,"he has been Leader of the Labor Party, and to",56
NA,the Prime Minister's answer in question time,56
NA,on 4 June when he most indignantly denied,56
NA,that he or his office had spoken to Mr Grant,56
NA,"in relation to OzCar, the taxpayer funded",56
NA,"finance company, or had made any represen-",56
NA,tations on behalf of Mr Grant. Does the,56
NA,Prime Minister stand by this denial?,56
Mr RUDD,My answer is as it was the,56
NA,last time the honourable member raised this,56
NA,question because that is the advice I have,56
NA,"received from my office. Furthermore, can I",56
NA,"say to the honourable member that, since this",56
NA,particular vehicle was provided by the indi-,56
NA,"vidual concerned, the declaration on pecuni-",56
NA,ary interest was made. The ute was valued at,56
NA,"around $5,000; it was put in my pecuniary",56
NA,"interest statement on 3 July 2007, as is re-",56
NA,quired by the Commonwealth parliament.,56
NA,"Furthermore, I would say to the honourable",56
NA,"member that, in terms of representations that",56
NA,have been made by various members in this,56
NA,"place, I am also advised that in addition to",56
NA,"the car dealer from Sydney who spoke to me,",56
NA,"Mr Kaplan, from Hunter Holden in Sydney,",56
NA,OzCar which I referred to the other day in answer to,56
NA,"the honourable member's question, there",56
NA,have also been representations to the gov-,56
NA,"ernment from the member for Riverina, the",56
NA,"member for Dunkley, the member for",56
NA,"Murray and, of course, the member for Daw-",56
NA,son as well. It is entirely normal for repre-,56
NA,sentations to be made to OzCar because this,56
NA,is the sort of thing that members of parlia-,57
NA,ment are required to do if they are asked to,57
NA,actually get out there and support the indus-,57
NA,try.,57
NA,The reason this particular facility existed,57
NA,was that we were approached as a govern-,57
NA,ment by the industry at the end of 2008 about,57
NA,the collapse in normal supplies of motor ve-,57
NA,"hicle finance. As a consequence of that, the",57
NA,government took the view that a co-,57
NA,"investment vehicle, a special-purpose vehi-",57
NA,"cle, between ourselves and the banks was an",57
NA,appropriate way to step into the marketplace,57
NA,"and to provide, therefore, an alternative",57
NA,source of finance. We have also been advised,57
NA,"that, had we not done so, the impact that",57
NA,would have had in terms of confidence,57
NA,across the industry would have been signifi-,57
NA,"cant. Therefore, I would say this has been a",57
NA,worthwhile measure on the part of the gov-,57
NA,"ernment, and any member of this place, if",57
NA,they are approached by a business seeking to,57
NA,"access a government program, would be en-",57
NA,tirely entitled to make representations.,57
NA,go back to the honourable member's ques-,57
NA,tion: the advice that I received from my of-,57
NA,fice remains current on the matter which the,57
NA,honourable member raises.,57
NA,Economy,57
Mr RAGUSE ,2.48 pm)-My question is,57
NA,to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline,57
NA,the House the estimated cost to the economy,57
NA,and the budget of not acting to support up to,57
NA,"210,000 jobs?",57
Mr SWAN,I thank the member for,57
NA,Forde for his very important question. It is,57
NA,the case that the No. 1 priority of the gov-,57
NA,ernment is jobs-to support Australian jobs,57
NA,in the face of this most savage global reces-,57
NA,"sion. Of course, the economic stimulus that",57
NA,we have put in place is expected to reduce,57
NA,the forecast peak in the unemployment rate,57
NA,by 1½ percentage points and it will support,57
NA,"up to 210,000 more jobs over the period",57
NA,ahead. That is something the government is,57
NA,very proud of. It is important for us to invest,57
NA,"in nation-building infrastructure, to support",57
NA,employment and to support business given,57
NA,the fact that there is a withdrawal of private,57
NA,investment and given the collapse in the,57
NA,terms of trade-the dramatic reduction in,57
NA,national income. All of those reasons make it,57
NA,"very important that our stimulus, through",57
NA,"phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3, continues. That",57
NA,means we do need to borrow responsibly to,57
NA,support employment and to support Austra-,57
NA,"lian businesses. The fact that 210,000 Austra-",57
NA,lian families with breadwinners benefit from,57
NA,that is very important. We should not under-,57
NA,estimate the cost to the economy if the un-,57
NA,employment rate were to go up even higher.,57
NA,"Treasury estimate that, without economic",57
NA,"stimulus, total employee incomes over the",57
NA,next decade would be around $100 billion,57
NA,"lower. As a result, budget revenues from less",57
NA,income tax alone would be about $23 billion,57
NA,"lower. Of course, spending on unemploy-",57
NA,But to ment benefits would be about $4 billion,57
NA,higher over the next four years and of course,57
NA,the number of long-term unemployed would,57
NA,be higher. All of those things come at a tre-,57
NA,mendous cost to the economy.,57
NA,"But, in this discussion about stimulus and",57
NA,"what it does, we should also focus on the",57
NA,to human cost of unemployment-what cost is,57
NA,passed on to the economy through the break-,57
NA,up of families and through the impact on,57
NA,local communities. Every job lost is one too,57
NA,"many, which is why the government is so",57
NA,determined to put in place its economic,57
NA,stimulus to support employment and to sup-,57
NA,"port businesses. We have heard in the House,",57
NA,particularly from the Deputy Prime Minister,57
NA,"earlier, just how important the investment is",57
NA,in schools and just how important the in-,57
NA,"vestment is in social housing, in clean energy",57
NA,and so on-to support employment while at,57
NA,the same time leaving a lasting legacy for the,57
NA,country. This government is absolutely de-,57
NA,"termined to be on the front foot, to put in",58
NA,place positive plans for the future so that it,58
NA,can support employment and make our,58
NA,economy and country a far better place.,58
NA,OzCar,58
Mr TURNBULL ,2.51 pm)-My ques-,58
NA,tion is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer,58
NA,to his statement in question time on 4 June,58
NA,that Mr John Grant's representations in rela-,58
NA,tion to OzCar were referred to Treasury as,58
NA,the responsible agency for this taxpayer,58
NA,funded finance company. Will the Treasurer,58
NA,advise the House what manner of assistance,58
NA,his office requested Treasury officials were,58
NA,to give to Mr Grant?,58
Mr SWAN, Mr Grant approached my of-,58
NA,fice. He was referred to a departmental liai-,58
NA,son officer who then referred him on to the,58
NA,relevant section of the department. Mr Grant,58
NA,would have received the same assistance as,58
NA,any other car dealer who was referred,58
NA,through that process received.,58
NA,Economy,58
Mr BRADBURY ,2.52 pm)-My ques-,58
NA,tion is to the Minister for Finance and De-,58
NA,regulation. How have the government's,58
NA,stimulus measures helped to support the Aus-,58
NA,tralian economy and why is it important for,58
NA,these measures to receive broad support from,58
NA,all parts of the community?,58
Mr TANNER,I think the member for,58
NA,Lindsay for his question. Could I also wish,58
NA,the member for Higgins well on his depar-,58
NA,ture. It is always a sad day when parliament,58
NA,"loses a dedicated Essendon supporter, al-",58
NA,though the Minister for Trade may not agree,58
NA,"with that, and I wish him well. The govern-",58
NA,ment has put in place an economic strategy,58
NA,built around stimulating economic activity in,58
NA,various sections of the economy in order to,58
NA,take up the slack being left by the global,58
NA,contraction that is hitting the entire world.,58
NA,"doing so, we are sustaining approximately",58
NA,"210,000 jobs and countless businesses that",58
NA,otherwise would go under as a result of the,58
NA,global recession. That stimulus is going,58
NA,through payments as to maintenance of,58
NA,"school buildings, construction of new school",58
NA,"buildings, construction of new homes and",58
NA,"construction of new road, rail and other pro-",58
NA,jects. That stimulus strategy has received,58
NA,widespread support throughout the commu-,58
NA,nity including from most sections of the,58
NA,"business community. But, sadly, that support",58
NA,has not been universal. It is particularly dis-,58
NA,appointing that the opposition not only has,58
NA,refused to support the government's eco-,58
NA,nomic stimulus strategy but has continued to,58
NA,snipe at it in an even more hysterical and,58
NA,unfounded way.,58
NA,"But last Friday the shadow Treasurer, the",58
NA,"member for North Sydney, broke his own",58
NA,previous world record for silliness when he,58
NA,blamed the Commonwealth Bank's increase,58
NA,of 0.1 per cent in its interest rates on the,58
NA,government's stimulus package. I note that,58
NA,this was coming from a former cabinet min-,58
NA,ister from a party that when in government,58
NA,promised to keep interest rates at record lows,58
NA,and then delivered 10 interest rate increases,58
NA,in a row. I note also that a respected econom-,58
NA,ics commentator and member of the press,58
NA,gallery described these claims as ‘bizarre,58
NA,garbage'. I think that is a very apt description,58
NA,of the accusation that the shadow Treasurer,58
NA,made.,58
NA,The factor that has been driving the sepa-,58
NA,ration of market interest rates from official,58
NA,Reserve Bank of Australia interest rates over,58
NA,the past 12 months or so is universally ac-,58
NA,knowledged as the turbulence on interna-,58
NA,"tional financial markets, on global financial",58
NA,markets. That is certainly the reason that the,58
NA,Commonwealth Bank has advanced for the,58
NA,position that it has taken with respect to its,58
NA,market interest rates: the higher cost of,58
NA,In wholesale funding flowing through from,58
NA,international financial markets into market,58
NA,"interest rates in Australia. In effect, the posi-",58
NA,tion being taken by the shadow Treasurer and,59
NA,being endorsed implicitly by the Leader of,59
NA,the Opposition today says that projected,59
NA,"Australian government borrowing, the vast",59
NA,"bulk of which has yet to occur, is pushing up",59
NA,interest rates in global financial markets and,59
NA,that is crowding out private sector activity in,59
NA,global financial markets. Any examination of,59
NA,the facts will demonstrate that this cannot be,59
NA,the case because the Australian proportion of,59
NA,total global government borrowing is ex-,59
NA,"tremely small, as the Prime Minister outlined",59
NA,"before, and Australia has the lowest pro-",59
NA,jected debt profile of all of the major devel-,59
NA,oped economies in the world.,59
NA,"It is interesting to note, if you want to fol-",59
NA,low their arguments and if you want to fol-,59
NA,low through the logic of some of their state-,59
NA,"ments, and also it is always worth referring",59
NA,back to what the opposition said a little while,59
NA,"ago. In effect, what they are saying at the",59
NA,moment is that the government is borrowing,59
NA,in order to finance stimulus payments and,59
NA,that that borrowing is crowding out the abil-,59
NA,ity of Australia's banks to finance lending,59
NA,and as a result they have to push up interest,59
NA,rates. It is not that long ago that an opposi-,59
NA,tion member stood here telling us that those,59
NA,same payments were not going to be spent.,59
NA,They were going to be saved. They were go-,59
NA,ing to end up with the banks. They were go-,59
NA,ing to end up in people's bank accounts. So,59
NA,somehow or other the banks are losing,59
NA,money as a result of borrowing for the stimu-,59
NA,lus payments which are ending up with the,59
NA,"banks, according to the position of the oppo-",59
NA,"sition. The same person has also said that,",59
NA,should the opposition be elected and were it,59
NA,"in office tomorrow, it would maintain the",59
NA,government's stimulus strategy. With Laurie,59
NA,"Oakes eight days ago, when asked about this",59
NA,"issue, the shadow Treasurer, the member for",59
NA,"North Sydney, said that it was hard to un-",59
NA,"scramble the egg and that the opposition,",59
NA,"were it to become the government tomorrow,",59
NA,would maintain the government's stimulus,59
NA,"strategy. The shadow Treasurer has a habit,",59
NA,"unfortunately, of saying whatever pops into",59
NA,"his head irrespective of substance, rigour and",59
NA,any kind of content.,59
NA,Mr Hockey-What am I thinking now?,59
NA,"What am I thinking now, Lindsay?",59
NA,Ms Gillard-‘When's Malcolm Turnbull,59
NA,retiring?'-that's what you're thinking.,59
Mr TANNER,That is right. There are,59
NA,"two people who are very glad you are going,",59
NA,"Peter, and they are both on that side. In the",59
NA,same interview with Laurie Oakes eight days,59
NA,"ago, the member for North Sydney accused",59
NA,the government of ‘spending record levels on,59
NA,advertising'. I thought I had entered a paral-,59
NA,lel universe on that Sunday morning. It was,59
NA,early in the morning and I was a bit con-,59
NA,cerned about my state of mind. I thought I,59
NA,had better check the facts. The facts are,59
NA,these: in calendar 2007 total spending on,59
NA,"government campaign advertising, $254 mil-",59
NA,lion; in the 2008 calendar year total spending,59
NA,"on government campaign advertising, $87",59
NA,"million-in other words, barely a third of the",59
NA,record level set by the former government of,59
NA,which the shadow Treasurer was a member.,59
NA,"In conclusion, I would like to draw the",59
NA,House's attention to the shadow Treasurer's,59
NA,solution to the problem that he believes is,59
NA,there with government spending and borrow-,59
NA,"ing crowding out the private sector. He says,",59
NA,‘The government should spend less money.',59
NA,"Now, there is a slight problem with that.",59
NA,There is something of a problem as those,59
NA,opposite have yet to nominate a single sav-,59
NA,ings proposal in 18 months-not one. They,59
NA,say they would continue with the govern-,59
NA,ment's stimulus payments were they in office,59
NA,tomorrow. They continue to block govern-,59
NA,"ment savings initiatives in the Senate and, of",59
NA,"course, they keep dropping out expensive",59
NA,"new promises on top of that. So for them, as",59
NA,"the opposition, to suggest that the govern-",59
NA,ment should be spending less money would,60
NA,be slightly more credible were they to actu-,60
NA,ally act in opposition in the same way as we,60
NA,"did and put forward savings proposals, as the",60
NA,"Prime Minister, the Treasurer and I did in",60
NA,opposition prior to the 2007 election. It is,60
NA,time that the opposition put the shadow,60
NA,Treasurer out of his misery. I used to think it,60
NA,was crook that they had a shadow Treasurer,60
NA,who nicked other people's lines. I have now,60
NA,worked out there is one thing even worse.,60
NA,That is someone who makes up his own.,60
NA,Building the Education Revolution,60
NA,Program,60
NA,NA,60
NA,the Minister for Education. I refer the minis-,60
NA,ter to the Hastings Public School in New,60
NA,"South Wales, which was granted $400,000",60
NA,for a covered outdoor learning area under the,60
NA,schools stimulus debacle. Given that the,60
NA,Hastings Public School built a similar cov-,60
NA,"ered outdoor learning area for just $40,000 in",60
NA,2003-this represents a tenfold leap in just,60
NA,six years-what action will the minister take,60
NA,to stamp out waste and mismanagement in,60
NA,the schools stimulus debacle?,60
Ms GILLARD,I thank the shadow min-,60
NA,"ister for his question, because it proves yet",60
NA,again how little the Liberal Party cares about,60
NA,education in this country. On the specific,60
NA,"school that he raises, I will of course investiIf",60
NA,"gate the details of this matter, but can I say",60
NA,this: the track record of the Liberal Party in,60
NA,raising accurate claims in this House is a,60
NA,very poor one indeed. Given that we have,60
NA,already had questions from the Liberal oppo-,60
NA,"sition which, when investigated, turned out",60
NA,"to be completely incorrect, I will not accept",60
NA,any fact asserted by the shadow minister,60
NA,without having it thoroughly checked. So we,60
NA,will undertake those checks.,60
NA,The shadow minister might think it is,60
NA,"smart, as a representative of the Liberal",60
NA,"Party, to go around the country insulting",60
NA,school communities on the work that is hap-,60
NA,pening in their schools. The Leader of the,60
NA,Opposition might think it is smart to vote,60
NA,against $14.7 billion going into local schools,60
NA,and all of the support for local jobs that that,60
NA,"provides. But, if they ever got out of their",60
NA,Liberal Party bubble and went to a school,60
NA,and spoke to some real human beings about,60
NA,"what is happening in their school, they",60
NA,would find a sense of delight about the pos-,60
NA,sibilities for better quality education that this,60
NA,program brings. I personally have visited,60
NA,schools. I have addressed principals forums,60
NA,where we have talked through Building the,60
NA,"Education Revolution and where principals,",60
NA,"teachers, parents and, indeed, students them-",60
NA,selves have been delighted about the possi-,60
NA,bility that it brings to their school and the,60
NA,support that it brings to their local commu-,60
NA,nity.,60
NA,Here we are in the parliament and what,60
NA,we hear constantly from the opposition is,60
NA,"carping, moaning and criticism, just like we",60
NA,are hearing now. What we never hear from,60
NA,the shadow minister for education is an edu-,60
NA,"cation policy-not once, not ever.",60
NA,NA,60
NA,der under the standing orders: the minister,60
NA,was asked a very specific question about,60
NA,profiteering. She is now engaging in rhetoric.,60
NA,she does not know the answer off the top,60
NA,"of her head, she should simply sit down.",60
The SPEAKER,Order! The Deputy,60
NA,Prime Minister is responding to the question.,60
Ms GILLARD,"In conclusion, the gov-",60
NA,ernment will get on with delivering its edu-,60
NA,cation revolution. I wait for policy state-,60
NA,ments from the shadow minister. When he,60
NA,"makes those policy statements, I think that",60
NA,they should include answers to the follow-,60
NA,ing: if the Liberal Party were elected at the,60
NA,"next election, would they stop Building the",60
NA,Education Revolution? If the Liberal Party,60
NA,"were elected at the next election, would they",60
NA,stop the national curriculum process? If the,61
NA,Liberal Party were elected at the next elec-,61
NA,"tion, would they stop the extra money that",61
NA,we provided for primary schools recurrent,61
NA,for government schools? If the Liberal Party,61
NA,"were elected at the next election, would they",61
NA,stop our national partnerships for disadvan-,61
NA,taged schools? If the Liberal Party were,61
NA,"elected at the next election, would they stop",61
NA,our half-billion-dollar investment in,61
NA,and numeracy? If the Liberal Party were,61
NA,"elected at the next election, would they stop",61
NA,our $550 million investment in teacher qual-,61
NA,ity? If the Liberal Party were elected at the,61
NA,"next election, would they stop our invest-",61
NA,ment in universal preschools? If the Liberal,61
NA,"Party were elected at the next election,",61
NA,would they stop the delivery of more than,61
NA,"700,000 more productivity places? If the",61
NA,Liberal Party were elected at the next elec-,61
NA,"tion, would they stop the Bradley reforms? I",61
NA,await the answers.,61
NA,Infrastructure,61
Ms SAFFIN ,3.05 pm)-My question is,61
NA,"to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport,",61
NA,Regional Development and Local Govern-,61
NA,ment. Will the minister please update the,61
NA,House on the rollout of the government's,61
NA,record investment in regional infrastructure,61
NA,and on how it is being received by regional,61
NA,representatives?,61
Mr ALBANESE,I thank the member,61
NA,for Page for her question. More than $21,61
NA,billion of the $35 billion we have set aside,61
NA,for transport infrastructure will be spent in,61
NA,regional and rural Australia. The member for,61
NA,Page will certainly be pleased-I am not,61
NA,quite so sure about the member for Cow-,61
NA,per-that I have announced today that de-,61
NA,tailed engineering work will start this week,61
NA,on the $618 million Kempsey bypass. That,61
NA,will enable construction work to commence,61
NA,"at the beginning of next year, creating some",61
NA,"450 direct jobs, as well as many indirect",61
NA,"jobs, in Kempsey on the North Coast of New",61
NA,South Wales. I am asked about how the in-,61
NA,vestment in regional Australia is being re-,61
NA,"ceived. Certainly, a number of National Party",61
NA,representatives have had a say about this,61
NA,project-which they could not get around to,61
NA,doing in 12 long years-that it is long over-,61
NA,due. This is a direct piece of self-criticism,61
NA,"from the National Party representatives, in-",61
NA,literacy cluding the member for Cowper.,61
NA,Regional representatives have also had a,61
NA,bit to say. The Vice-President of the National,61
NA,Farmers Federation has said:,61
NA,"Transport infrastructure investment, including",61
NA,"road and port funding, is welcomed.",61
NA,He said that in a statement that the NFF put,61
NA,out supporting this government's record,61
NA,funding in regional Australia. I am asked,61
NA,about other representatives and what they,61
NA,had to say about our budget proposals and,61
NA,the record investment which is supporting,61
NA,jobs today and building the infrastructure,61
NA,that Australia needs for tomorrow.,61
NA,I note that the Leader of the National,61
NA,Party was speaking at a New South Wales,61
NA,Nationals conference in Wagga Wagga last,61
NA,Friday. He is also the shadow minister for,61
NA,transport and I thought he might have a bit to,61
NA,say at that conference. Members will recall,61
NA,the amendment moved to the Nation Build-,61
NA,"ing Program legislation, when the parliament",61
NA,"sat a couple of weeks ago, that would stop",61
NA,funding of black spots in regional communi-,61
NA,ties. Remember that amendment which the,61
NA,opposition moved so that you could not have,61
NA,black spot funding on the national network?,61
NA,They all went to the photo opportunities in,61
NA,"their electorates applauding the funding, yet",61
NA,they had voted against it being permitted,61
NA,under the Nation Building Program. I,61
NA,thought the Leader of the National Party,61
NA,might have a bit to say about how the oppo-,61
NA,sition are taking on the government over this,61
NA,outrageous measure that they say the gov-,61
NA,ernment has put in. I had a look at the speech,62
NA,"and there are 2,600 words in it but transport",62
NA,"is not mentioned, not even once. There is not",62
NA,one word from the shadow minister about,62
NA,transport. There is nothing about nation,62
NA,building or about infrastructure. He had,62
NA,nothing at all to say.,62
NA,The Leader of the National Party was in,62
NA,Wagga Wagga at the conference and he,62
NA,would have known-and there would have,62
NA,"been people from Wagga Wagga there, too,",62
NA,who would have known-that we are dupli-,62
NA,"cating the Hume Highway by 2012, and that",62
NA,we are bringing forward record spending on,62
NA,the Hume Highway. I had a look at what was,62
NA,in the speech of the Leader of the National,62
NA,Party and he said a very interesting thing. He,62
NA,said:,62
NA,We are increasingly seen as the party of regional tomorrow.,62
NA,"Australia, grounded in the regions and taking",62
NA,forward regional expertise and ideas for consid-,62
NA,eration in Canberra and Macquarie Street.,62
NA,"That is an interesting perspective given that,",62
NA,when I was elected here in 1996 there were,62
NA,18 Nationals in the parliament and now there,62
NA,are nine. Yet they argue that they are moving,62
NA,forward and are increasingly seen as the,62
NA,party of regional Australia.,62
NA,Mr Oakeshott interjecting-,62
Mr ALBANESE,I notice the member,62
NA,for Lyne having a good chuckle at the idea,62
NA,that the National Party are the party of re-,62
NA,gional Australia and that they are moving,62
NA,forward in Macquarie Street and in Canberra.,62
NA,The Leader of the National Party has become,62
NA,the Comical Ali of the Parliament. Remem-,62
NA,ber Comical Ali as the US troops came into,62
NA,"Baghdad? He said, ‘It's okay, nothing's hap-",62
NA,"pening. It's okay, we're going well.' Comical",62
NA,"Ali had this to say about the Americans, ‘We",62
NA,have destroyed their shovels. We have driven,62
NA,"them back.' Well, those opposite want to de-",62
NA,"stroy the shovels of the government, those",62
NA,nation-building shovels that are being util-,62
NA,"ised throughout the country to build roads, to",62
NA,"build rail and to build ports. Those opposite,",62
NA,in spite of their best efforts to stop the na-,62
NA,"tion-building agenda of this government, will",62
NA,not succeed.,62
NA,I must say that the Leader of the National,62
NA,Party perhaps listened to the leader of the,62
NA,"coalition who said, on 20 May when he was",62
NA,"in Adelaide, about the government's nation-",62
NA,building agenda and I quote:,62
NA,… everything will have to be reviewed. There's,62
NA,no question about that.,62
NA,What we see is those opposite drawing into,62
NA,question the nation-building agenda that the,62
NA,government has. The government will not be,62
NA,deterred. It will continue to support programs,62
NA,which support jobs today and which build,62
NA,the infrastructure that Australia needs for,62
NA,Building the Education Revolution,62
NA,Program,62
NA,NA,62
NA,the Minister for Education. Does the minister,62
NA,agree with the Prime Minister's comments,62
NA,on 3 February about the school stimulus,62
NA,"package when he said, ‘This government will",62
NA,adopt a zero tolerance approach to any state,62
NA,"government, whatever its political complex-",62
NA,"ion, to any substitution of effort,' and, if so,",62
NA,what action will the government take against,62
NA,"the South Australian government, which cut",62
NA,funding by 12 per cent for capital works pro-,62
NA,grams in schools in its 2009-10 budget?,62
The SPEAKER,I call the Deputy Prime,62
NA,Minister.,62
Ms GILLARD,"Thank you very much,",62
NA,"Mr Speaker, and once again, because we do",62
NA,not have accurate questions from the shadow,62
NA,"minister for education, I will check what he",62
NA,"has asserted, because we know from former",62
NA,question times that assertions made by the,62
NA,opposition about Building the Education,62
NA,Revolution and about the government's edu-,62
NA,cation policies generally turn out to be com-,63
NA,pletely spurious when investigated.,63
NA,What I can say to the shadow minister-,63
NA,and he may or may not be interested because,63
NA,the degree of seriousness with which he,63
NA,takes his education work is always some-,63
NA,thing to be doubted-is that the government,63
NA,is absolutely determined that the Building,63
NA,the Education Revolution program is an ad-,63
NA,dition to investment that would have hap-,63
NA,pened in any event as a result of state budg-,63
NA,ets. We work constantly with our state and,63
NA,territory colleagues to deliver that program.,63
NA,The sanctions that can be applied under the,63
NA,agreements that surround the Building the,63
NA,Education Revolution program are serious,63
NA,ones and they are understood by our state,63
NA,and territory colleagues.,63
NA,Can I reiterate: for a man who earlier in,63
NA,"question time was yelling at me, ‘What about",63
NA,Gepps Cross school?' only to be humiliated,63
NA,when his claim was found to be ridiculous-,63
NA,"Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a",63
NA,point of order. The question was specifically,63
NA,in relation to the cut of 12 per cent to the,63
NA,capital works program in the South Austra-,63
NA,lian budget. I would ask the Deputy Prime,63
NA,Minister to answer what action-,63
The SPEAKER,Order! The Deputy,63
NA,Prime Minister is responding to the question.,63
Ms GILLARD,I certainly will investi-,63
NA,"gate the claims made. But, given the Deputy",63
NA,Leader of the Opposition has risen to her feet,63
NA,to once again indicate an interest in educa-,63
NA,"tion, I will take the opportunity to remind",63
NA,"House that, when she was minister for edu-",63
NA,"cation, we did have a problem with funding",63
NA,going to schools that were closing. I remind,63
NA,the Deputy Leader of the Opposition of the,63
NA,Investing in Our Schools Program grant she,63
NA,made to the Bowral Rudolf Steiner School in,63
NA,"2007, when it closed in 2007. There is the",63
NA,grant that she made to the Marist College,63
NA,"Rosalie School in 2008, when it closed in",63
NA,2008.,63
NA,"Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I-",63
The SPEAKER,Order! The Deputy,63
NA,Prime Minister will resume her seat and the,63
NA,Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume,63
NA,her seat.,63
NA,Ms Julie Bishop interjecting-,63
The SPEAKER,Order! The Deputy,63
NA,Leader of the Opposition will resume her,63
NA,seat! The Deputy Prime Minister will refer,63
NA,her remarks to the question before us.,63
Ms GILLARD,As I understand the,63
NA,"question before us, questions are being raised",63
NA,about the government's education programs.,63
NA,The simple point I was making is that some,63
NA,of these criticisms lie ill in the mouths of,63
NA,people whose administration-,63
NA,NA,63
NA,order. I am happy to repeat the question if,63
NA,the Deputy Prime Minister seems to have,63
NA,forgotten it. It was not a general question. It,63
NA,was about states skimming-12 per cent by,63
NA,the state government in South Australia-,63
The SPEAKER,Order! There is no,63
NA,need to repeat the question. The Manager of,63
NA,Opposition Business will resume his seat.,63
Ms GILLARD,"Can I reiterate that, ob-",63
NA,"viously, Building the Education Revolution",63
NA,is an economic stimulus package. It is to go,63
NA,on top of other expenditures. I will investi-,63
NA,"gate the claims made, but I make this very",63
NA,simple point: for an opposition that opposed,63
NA,"the this program lock, stock and barrel, under",63
NA,whose administration not one school would,63
NA,"get one cent, it seems to me pretty interesting",63
NA,that they come in here day after day with,63
NA,"claims that, when investigated, turn out to be",63
NA,fabricated. On the track record of the opposi-,63
NA,tion when it was in government and the track,63
NA,record of those who held the education port-,63
NA,"folio, let us just contemplate for a moment",63
NA,"what, if any, lasting reforms people will be",63
NA,talking about from the Howard era. Can't,64
NA,"think of one? Well, there would be a good",64
NA,reason for that.,64
NA,Solar Energy,64
Mr BEVIS ,3.17 pm)-My question is to,64
NA,"the Minister for the Environment, Heritage",64
NA,and the Arts. How will the new solar credits,64
NA,continue the government's unprecedented,64
NA,support for the solar panel industry? How,64
NA,does this approach compare with previous,64
NA,approaches in delivering value for money in,64
NA,environmental and water programs?,64
Mr GARRETT,I thank the member for,64
NA,Brisbane for his question. The fact is that,64
NA,there is more government support for the,64
NA,solar industry and there are more solar panels,64
NA,going onto Australian rooftops under the,64
NA,Rudd government than at any previous time.,64
NA,The pre-election commitment of $150 mil-,64
NA,"lion for five years was to fund 15,000 solar",64
NA,rebates; we now have funded more than,64
NA,"80,000 solar rebates from the time we came",64
NA,to government. That exceeds our election,64
NA,"commitment some fourfold. Over 60,000",64
NA,installations are in the pipeline and that,64
NA,means that the industry has at least 12,64
NA,"months work, according to current rates, to",64
NA,continue putting solar panels on people's,64
NA,roofs.,64
NA,During the coalition's entire 12 years in,64
NA,"office, the solar rebate program supported",64
NA,"around 10,500 installations of solar panels.",64
NA,"That is 10,000 panels over 12 years versus",64
NA,"80,000 in just 18 months. I am reminded of",64
NA,that song What a Difference a Day Makes.,64
NA,Some of you will know the melody.,64
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,64
Mr GARRETT,"I will not sing it here,",64
NA,although I know you would like me to. What,64
NA,a difference a day makes not only for the,64
NA,"Leader of the Opposition, given the an-",64
NA,nouncement by the member for Higgins;,64
NA,what a difference 18 months makes in the,64
NA,"term of a government. Now, with solar cred-",64
NA,its operating through the renewable energy,64
NA,"target, there is long-term certainty for the",64
NA,solar industry to go and to grow and to invest,64
NA,beyond budget cycles. There will be an up-,64
NA,front capital cost subsidy to all households,64
NA,"and no means test. Households, the local fish",64
NA,"and chip shop, farmers, community groups,",64
NA,businesses and families are all in the market,64
NA,"for solar credits. The member for Flinders,",64
NA,"who I notice is absent today, said last week",64
NA,in relation to the Leader of the Opposition:,64
NA,Malcolm Turnbull was the guy who introduced,64
NA,"the $8,000 rebate. He knew it was going to be",64
NA,successful. He wanted it to be successful and that,64
NA,is why he actually introduced it as an uncapped,64
NA,rebate.,64
NA,"He said, ‘Look, if this is successful, that's a good",64
NA,problem we'll have to deal with not a bad prob-,64
NA,lem.',64
NA,I want to advise the House of the real story.,64
NA,When the now Leader of the Opposition did,64
NA,"increase solar rebates in 2007, he said that he",64
NA,expected the program to be unpopular. I refer,64
NA,"to the Daily Telegraph of 12 May 2007,",64
NA,which reported:,64
NA,Environment Minister Malcolm Turnbull doesn't,64
NA,need a state-wide survey showing him solar en-,64
NA,ergy is unpopular. He already knows. The Satur-,64
NA,day Daily Telegraph can reveal the reason the,64
NA,federal government didn't make its $150 million,64
NA,solar rebate any bigger was because there was not,64
NA,enough demand for solar panels. ‘If demand ex-,64
NA,ceeds our expectations then obviously we'll re-,64
NA,"view the scheme,' he said. ‘To date shortage of",64
NA,money has not been an issue. Solar panels are still,64
NA,pretty expensive.',64
NA,So we have the member for Flinders saying,64
NA,that the opposition wrote a blank cheque for,64
NA,solar rebates because Mr Turnbull knew it,64
NA,"was going to be successful. But, in 2007, the",64
NA,now Leader of the Opposition was back-,64
NA,grounding the Daily Telegraph and saying,64
NA,that his expectations would be that the rebate,64
NA,would be unpopular. This is an absolute,64
NA,sham. But we should not be surprised by the,64
NA,opposition.,64
NA,I was asked how this compares with pre-,65
NA,vious approaches to deliver value-on envi-,65
NA,"ronmental values, on programs, on water",65
NA,programs and the like. At the same time as,65
NA,very few solar panels were going onto the,65
NA,roofs of Australian homes under the coalition,65
NA,government when the Leader of the Opposi-,65
NA,"tion was the minister for the environment, he",65
NA,had responsibility for water policy as well.,65
NA,What was that water policy? It was water,65
NA,policy dreamt up on the back of an envelope:,65
NA,"a commitment to spend money, not a single",65
NA,delivery of water back into the Murray-,65
NA,"Darling Basin system, with no consultation",65
NA,"with Treasury, no consultation with the now-",65
NA,"departing member for Higgins, no consulta-",65
NA,tion with farmers organisations-in other,65
NA,"words, just doing it on the run.",65
NA,"It should not surprise us because, well",65
NA,"fore the last election, we know that the",65
NA,Leader of the Opposition was focusing on,65
NA,another aspect of water policy. This was the,65
NA,advice that the Leader of the Opposition re-,65
NA,ceived from his department to spend some $2,65
NA,million on investigating cloud-seeding tech-,65
NA,nologies. There we were two days into the,65
NA,"election campaign, with the substantial mat-",65
NA,"ters of policy to be determined, including",65
NA,what the government was then going to bring,65
NA,to the people by way of climate change pol-,65
NA,"icy and the like, and we had the member for",65
NA,"Wentworth writing to the Prime Minister,",65
NA,"saying, ‘Can we have $10 million to spend",65
NA,on the project?',65
NA,I should point out that a year earlier the,65
NA,"member for Wentworth, the now Leader of",65
NA,"the Opposition, had written to a scientific",65
NA,expert telling him that cloud seeding simply,65
NA,did not work. He used the expression that the,65
NA,results were ‘inconclusive at best'. Here we,65
NA,"had a reckless spending exercise, against the",65
NA,"advice of the minister's department, whilst at",65
NA,the same time there were no policies for re-,65
NA,"newable energy, no policies for green jobs",65
NA,and no policies for increasing the capacity of,65
NA,the solar industry to do what it had to do.,65
NA,Now we have the opposition leader support-,65
NA,"ing, it is said, the government's targets on",65
NA,"climate change, but with coalition members",65
NA,in his own party saying right out loud that,65
NA,they oppose the scheme.,65
NA,I say to the Leader of the Opposition: the,65
NA,confusion that is rampant within your ranks,65
NA,over climate change is an absolute dis-,65
NA,"grace-with business needing certainty, with",65
NA,green jobs ready to be put into place-and at,65
NA,this point in time we have an opposition,65
NA,leader who is opposed to the stimulus pack-,65
NA,age and who opposed the energy efficient,65
NA,homes plan. This is a plan which will see an,65
NA,extraordinary number of homes-some three,65
NA,million Australian households-get ceiling,65
NA,"insulation in their roofs, reducing the costs of",65
NA,"beenergy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions",65
NA,and producing jobs and green jobs at the,65
NA,same time. It is time that the opposition,65
NA,"leader focused on the real policy initiatives,",65
NA,recognised the importance of providing cer-,65
NA,tainty for the Australian public in dealing,65
NA,with climate change and looked at these sig-,65
NA,nificant issues and at the commitment that,65
NA,this government has to solar panels.,65
NA,National School Pride Program,65
Mr HAASE ,3.23 pm)-My question is,65
NA,addressed to the Minister for Education. Will,65
NA,the minister explain why her National School,65
NA,Pride program prohibits schools from install-,65
NA,ing air conditioning in existing classrooms,65
NA,"that have none and why, as a consequence,",65
NA,children in dozens of schools across my elec-,65
NA,torate of Kalgoorlie will continue to swelter,65
NA,or be sent home on all-too-frequent hot days?,65
Ms GILLARD,I thank the member for,65
NA,"his question, which I am very happy to an-",65
NA,swer. I suggest that perhaps he needs to have,65
NA,"a discussion with his shadow minister, be-",65
NA,cause what his shadow minister said in the,65
NA,last question is that he is concerned that state,65
NA,governments are not maintaining effort on,65
NA,"education capital and equipment, whereas",66
NA,the member has raised a question with me,66
NA,which would seem to suggest the only source,66
NA,of funding available to schools for things,66
NA,air conditioning is Building the Education,66
NA,Revolution. Building the Education Revolu-,66
NA,tion is for specific purposes. Amongst the,66
NA,specific purposes is the construction of new,66
NA,buildings and those buildings can be air con-,66
NA,"ditioned. Of course, on general repairs for",66
NA,schools and the air conditioning of class-,66
NA,"rooms, that is something that state govern-",66
NA,ments attend to for state schools. So he may,66
NA,want to raise his question with the state Lib-,66
NA,eral government-,66
NA,NA,66
The SPEAKER,Order! The member for,66
NA,Sturt will leave the chamber for one hour,66
NA,under 94(a).,66
NA,The member for Sturt then left the cham-,66
NA,ber.,66
Ms GILLARD,What the guidelines,66
NA,provide-and the guidelines are very clear-,66
NA,is for newly constructed buildings under,66
NA,Primary Schools for the 21st Century as part,66
NA,of Building the Education Revolution. Of,66
NA,"course, appropriate climate control, whether",66
NA,"it be air conditioning or heating, can be in-",66
NA,stalled. National School Pride program,66
NA,money can go to small-scale repairs and it is,66
NA,going to shadecloth and some of the other,66
NA,important things in schools. It is,66
NA,air conditioning; that is true. As the member,66
NA,"would be aware, a substantial consideration",66
NA,with the insertion of air conditioning in,66
NA,schools is the ongoing costs of running the,66
NA,"air conditioning. He would know, from the",66
NA,"climate he comes from, that the capital cost",66
NA,of putting in the air conditioning is one,66
NA,thing; the year-on-year power cost is another.,66
NA,We have obviously said to state govern-,66
NA,"ments, as we have gone about this task, that",66
NA,our economic stimulus is extra to the things,66
NA,that they ordinarily do. One of the things,66
NA,they ordinarily do is work out how to reno-,66
NA,"vate classrooms for climate control, includ-",66
NA,ing an understanding of what the ongoing,66
NA,like recurrent costs of that would be. We have,66
NA,"said to state governments that, with major",66
NA,constructs under Primary Schools for the,66
NA,"21st Century, appropriate climate control",66
NA,"will be part of the fit-out, as will the things",66
NA,"required to make buildings functional, in-",66
NA,cluding in some cases interactive white-,66
NA,boards and the like. Those things are all part,66
NA,of the program.,66
NA,I can understand that the member is dis-,66
NA,gruntled about the circumstances in his elec-,66
NA,torate for some of the children who attend,66
NA,school in his electorate. On the question of,66
NA,"air conditioning for current school facilities,",66
NA,he should feel very free to direct that to the,66
NA,state minister for education in his state of,66
NA,Western Australia.,66
NA,Climate Change,66
Mr DANBY ,3.27 pm)-My question is,66
NA,"to the Minister for Defence Personnel, Mate-",66
NA,riel and Science and the Minister Assisting,66
NA,the Minister for Climate Change. Will the,66
NA,minister outline to the House the work that,66
NA,has been done over the last decade to set up,66
NA,an emissions trading scheme and implement,66
NA,an expanded renewable energy target? How,66
NA,has this work assisted the government to take,66
NA,real action on climate change and how is this,66
NA,not going to action being received?,66
Mr COMBET,Thank you to the mem-,66
NA,ber for Melbourne Ports. As a former con-,66
NA,"stituent of his, I can attest to the fact that he",66
NA,has a serious interest in the issue of climate,66
NA,change. We all have a responsibility-,66
NA,including the opposition-to the Australian,66
NA,people and to future generations to act on,66
NA,"climate change. For the government's part,",66
NA,the government accepts the consensus view,66
NA,"of scientists. Importantly, the Fourth assess-",66
NA,ment report of the Intergovernmental Panel,66
NA,that on Climate Change states that warming is,66
NA,unequivocal and human activities are respon-,67
NA,sible for most of the observed warming over,67
NA,the last 50 years. That is a consequence of,67
NA,"the work of over 1,200 scientists from over",67
NA,130 countries that has been subject to peer,67
NA,"review, contained and represented in the",67
NA,Fourth assessment report of the IPCC. The,67
NA,government also accepts that if we fail to,67
NA,now we will cause irreparable damage to our,67
NA,"environment, economy and way of life. The",67
NA,fact is that Australia is a hot and dry contiAct.,67
NA,nent and failure to act will have an adverse,67
NA,"effect on our ecosystems and our economy,",67
NA,particularly on industries such as agriculture,67
NA,and tourism.,67
NA,Further delay in acting against climate,67
NA,change means the cost of adjustment will be,67
NA,greater and other countries will get ahead of,67
NA,us in creating the low-pollution jobs of the,67
NA,future. And that is why the government has,67
NA,established targets and developed the Carbon,67
NA,Pollution Reduction Scheme to go about,67
NA,achieving them. But in the face of all this,67
NA,evidence the coalition continue to ignore the,67
NA,challenge of climate change and insist on,67
NA,delay-even after 12 years in government,67
NA,characterised by inaction on this issue in,67
NA,face of numerous reports and commitments,67
NA,given during their period in government.,67
NA,Just to give an overview of some of the,67
NA,work and the advice that the coalition com-,67
NA,missioned and ignored: in 1999 there were,67
NA,no fewer than six reports to the Howard gov-,67
NA,"ernment, all of which were ignored. The",67
NA,Australian Greenhouse Office discussion,67
NA,paper series on emissions trading was issued,67
NA,during that year and included a discussion,67
NA,paper on establishing the boundaries of a,67
NA,"scheme, a discussion paper on issuing per-",67
NA,"mits, a discussion paper on how crediting",67
NA,"carbon pollution could occur, a discussion",67
NA,paper on designing the carbon-trading mar-,67
NA,"ket, a discussion paper on the greenhouse",67
NA,challenge and a further report of the Green-,67
NA,house Energy Group on planning for manda-,67
NA,tory targets for the uptake of renewable en-,67
NA,"ergy in power supplies, followed in the year",67
NA,2000 by a further report of the Australian,67
NA,Greenhouse Office on encouraging early,67
NA,greenhouse abatement mechanisms.,67
NA,In 2002 there was a further report from the,67
NA,Greenhouse Office on greenhouse gas emis-,67
NA,act sions. In 2003 there was a report on renew-,67
NA,able opportunities and a review of the opera-,67
NA,tion of the Renewable Energy (Electricity),67
NA,"In 2007, of course, there was the Sher-",67
NA,"gold report, from the Prime Minister's task",67
NA,"group at that time, on emissions trading,",67
NA,which led to the Howard government indi-,67
NA,cating that it would commit to an emissions,67
NA,"trading scheme. But in the face of all that,",67
NA,nothing was done. The advice was ignored.,67
NA,The reports were shelved.,67
NA,"During 2008, by contrast, the Rudd gov-",67
NA,ernment received the Garnaut Climate,67
NA,Change Review report. A green paper on the,67
NA,development of the Carbon Pollution Reduc-,67
NA,tion Scheme was developed. A white paper,67
NA,was issued in December 2008 and there were,67
NA,"numerous industry consultations. In 2009,",67
NA,"the draft CPRS legislation was released, nu-",67
NA,the merous Senate inquiries have been held and,67
NA,now the draft Renewable Energy (Electric-,67
NA,ity) Amendment Bill has been released. On,67
NA,"that point, the government intends imple-",67
NA,menting its policy by virtue of that legisla-,67
NA,tion to achieve 20 per cent of Australia's,67
NA,electricity supply being delivered by renew-,67
NA,able sources by the year 2020. That is ex-,67
NA,pected to drive $19 billion worth of invest-,67
NA,ment in renewable energy activity.,67
NA,These are great institutional changes.,67
NA,They are extremely important and in the face,67
NA,of them the coalition has abrogated its re-,67
NA,"sponsibility to support them. However, Mr",67
NA,"Turnbull, the Leader of the Opposition, has",67
NA,indicated what is the coalition's policy. He,67
NA,made this remark on 9 July 2008:,67
NA,… the Howard Government's policy last year was,68
NA,that we would establish an emissions trading,68
NA,tem not later than 2012.,68
NA,"And importantly, in the light of the excuses",68
NA,for delay that have been articulated by the,68
NA,"Liberal Party in recent times, Mr Turnbull,",68
NA,"the Leader of the Opposition, said:",68
NA,It was not conditional on international action …,68
NA,Commitment to an emissions trading system,68
NA,was to be pursued by the coalition. More,68
NA,"recently, the Leader of the Opposition has",68
NA,confirmed that there will be an emissions,68
NA,trading scheme in this country. The trouble is,68
NA,that the coalition and the Leader of the Op-,68
NA,position cannot deliver on these issues and,68
NA,all we have heard are excuses for delay. The,68
NA,reason that there are excuses for delay is that,68
NA,the opposition is deeply divided. And you do,68
NA,not have to take my point of view on it; there,68
NA,is plenty of evidence from members of the,68
NA,opposition. Take this quote from Senator,68
NA,Eric Abetz:,68
NA,There is no doubt that weeds-,68
NA,That was ‘weeds'-,68
NA,"pose … a challenge much clearer, more present",68
NA,and possibly more serious than the unclear chal-,68
NA,lenge which climate change may or may not pose,68
NA,to our biodiversity …,68
NA,And there are many other instances where,68
NA,members of the opposition have indicated a,68
NA,completely contrary view to that of the,68
NA,Leader of the Opposition on the issue of,68
NA,emissions trading and scepticism about the,68
NA,science. And that is the reason for the divi-,68
NA,sion on that side of politics and the reason,68
NA,that all they posit are excuses for delay. The,68
NA,government has brought forward the Carbon,68
NA,Pollution Reduction Scheme. It has passed,68
NA,through this House. We will be bringing for-,68
NA,ward legislation to establish a fourfold in-,68
NA,crease in the renewable energy target. We,68
NA,have established ambitious carbon pollution,68
NA,"reduction targets, we have signed the Kyoto",68
NA,Protocol and we will take action. It is time,68
NA,that the opposition exercised responsibility,68
NA,sys- on behalf of the Australian community on,68
NA,this question.,68
NA,Ms Julie Bishop-As the minister read,68
NA,"every single word of his answer, I ask that he",68
NA,table the document from which he was read-,68
NA,ing.,68
The SPEAKER,Was the minister quot-,68
NA,ing from a document?,68
NA,Mr Combet-Yes.,68
The SPEAKER,Was the document con-,68
NA,fidential?,68
NA,Mr Combet-Yes.,68
Mr TUCKEY ,I rise on a point of order. In,68
NA,the light of the minister's maiden answer,68
NA,"being confidential, could he disclose the au-",68
NA,thor?,68
The SPEAKER,The member for,68
NA,O'Connor will leave the chamber for one,68
NA,hour under the provisions of standing order,68
NA,94(a).,68
NA,The member for O'Connor then left the,68
NA,chamber.,68
NA,North West Queensland Mineral Province,68
Mr KATTER ,3.37 pm)-My question,68
NA,without notice is to the honourable Minister,68
NA,for Resources and Energy. The minister,68
NA,would be aware of his own role as the Lone,68
NA,Ranger riding to the rescue of the $15 billion,68
NA,North West Queensland Mineral Province,68
NA,about to be scalped by electricity demand,68
NA,"growth outstripping supply in 2012, the cur-",68
NA,rent cost of inefficient small power genera-,68
NA,tion rendering our mineral production non-,68
NA,"competitive, no growth capacity in the north-",68
NA,"west grid and CPR charges. In light of this,",68
NA,could the minister ensure-,68
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,68
Mr KATTER,"It is a bit important, you",68
NA,know. It really is a little bit important.,68
The SPEAKER,Order! The member for,69
NA,Kennedy has the call. I am trying to hear,69
NA,him.,69
Mr KATTER,I was wondering whether,69
NA,"I did, Mr Speaker. In light of this could the",69
NA,"minister ensure that (a) he arrives in time,",69
NA,he brings sufficient electricity with him and,69
NA,"(c) his proposed clean energy corridor, for",69
NA,which his grid connection has provided the,69
NA,"catalyst, will provide the silver bullet for",69
NA,"Xstrata, BHP, Rio Tinto and Gutnick's Leg-",69
NA,"end Mining with some 15,000 permanent",69
NA,jobs flowing from the Pentland biofuels pro-,69
NA,ject and the proposed mineral expansions?,69
NA,"Finally, if not, would he not agree that even",69
NA,Tonto might decide that he and the infra-,69
NA,"structure minister, Albanese, are palefaces?",69
The SPEAKER,"Just for the record, the",69
NA,last part of the question is out of order.,69
Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,I do not,69
NA,know where the Lone Ranger and Tonto are,69
NA,"today, but I can assure the House they long",69
NA,gave up trying to corral the member for,69
NA,"Kennedy. More seriously, this question is a",69
NA,very serious question. It goes to the potential,69
NA,development of the North West Mineral,69
NA,Province in Queensland. This province has,69
NA,long been held back by the lack of an ade-,69
NA,quate supply of energy at a reasonable cost.,69
NA,The member for Kennedy has raised the,69
NA,question of the possible development of the,69
NA,North West Mineral Province in the context,69
NA,of a key part of the government's recent,69
NA,budget strategy going to the establishment of,69
NA,a real government commitment to clean en-,69
NA,ergy in Australia. I welcome his support for,69
NA,"that government initiative, because it goes to",69
NA,our requirement to invest in not only carbon,69
NA,capture and storage but also renewable en-,69
NA,ergy in Australia. That is because we are not,69
NA,interested in trying to pick winners; we are,69
NA,about trying to create a framework that en-,69
NA,courages investment in all sources of poten-,69
NA,tial energy in Australia.,69
NA,"That takes me, firstly, to the question of",69
NA,carbon capture and storage and a commit-,69
NA,ment of $2.4 billion to cleaning up coal in,69
NA,"Australia, reducing emissions. CCS is vital",69
NA,"to our future, because 82 per cent of Austra-",69
NA,(b) lia's electricity comes from coal-fired power,69
NA,stations. I was pleased to see carbon capture,69
NA,"and storage in a commercial operation, the",69
NA,"Sleipner petroleum field, when I recently",69
NA,visited Norway. CCS is currently in place,69
NA,throughout the world and it is our responsi-,69
NA,"bility, not only as a coal-dependent energy",69
NA,"nation but also as a major coal exporter, to",69
NA,actually get this technology right. I would,69
NA,"also say that, if we achieve later this year the",69
NA,Gorgon gas investment of $30 billion to $50,69
NA,"billion, something that the Prime Minister",69
NA,"and I are working on at the moment, you will",69
NA,see the largest carbon capture and storage,69
NA,"operation in the world here, on Barrow Is-",69
NA,land in Western Australia.,69
NA,The member has also raised the need to,69
NA,focus on renewables. We are about investing,69
NA,real money-the biggest investment by an,69
NA,Australian government-in the renewables,69
NA,sector in Australia. That builds on our deter-,69
NA,mination to put in place a measured carbon,69
NA,pollution reduction scheme with a renewable,69
NA,energy target of 20 per cent by 2020. Our,69
NA,demonstration program of $1.6 billion in,69
NA,solar technologies is not just about solar PV;,69
NA,it is also about seriously investigating,69
NA,whether or not solar thermal could supply,69
NA,"real, baseload, secure energy in Australia-",69
NA,important not only to Australia but also to,69
NA,the global community.,69
NA,Not content with just focusing on carbon,69
NA,"capture and storage and solar, we are also",69
NA,going to encourage the exploration and de-,69
NA,"velopment of other demonstration activities,",69
NA,such as geothermal and wave power. This is,69
NA,"about us ensuring as a nation that, when it",69
NA,"comes to the issue of energy security, as we",69
NA,"move to a low-emission economy, we not",69
NA,only guarantee our own future but also put in,69
NA,place technology options of great interest,70
NA,and need to the global community at large.,70
NA,So I say to the member for Kennedy: I ex-,70
NA,press my appreciation for your support of the,70
NA,government's clean energy strategy. I am not,70
NA,the Lone Ranger; I have a huge posse behind,70
NA,me and absolute support of our clean energy,70
NA,demonstration program. Perhaps more im-,70
NA,"portantly, he, like me, understands and ap-",70
NA,preciates that without a commitment to clean,70
NA,energy we will never have a capacity to de-,70
NA,"velop the North West Mineral Province,",70
NA,which has the potential to be as important as,70
NA,north-west Western Australia. I thank him for,70
NA,his question.,70
NA,Swine Influenza,70
Mr SYMON ,3.43 pm)-My question is,70
NA,to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Will,70
NA,the minister advise the House on the latest,70
NA,swine flu developments in Australia and in-,70
NA,ternationally and on the government's re-,70
NA,sponse to date?,70
Ms ROXON,I thank the member for,70
NA,Deakin for his question. Obviously amongst,70
NA,Victorian members there is a particular inter-,70
NA,"est, but it is a matter of importance for the",70
NA,whole country. Members of the House may,70
NA,be aware that last Friday the World Health,70
NA,Organisation declared the H1N1 influenza,70
NA,"strain a pandemic, the first global pandemic",70
NA,for 40 years. The World Health Organisa-,70
NA,tion's phase 6 is characterised by community,70
NA,level outbreaks in at least one country in a,70
NA,different World Health Organisation region,70
NA,"from the source country-in this case, Mex-",70
NA,ico. It indicates that there is sustained hu-,70
NA,man-to-human community level transmis-,70
NA,sion.,70
NA,The WHO's decision to declare the first,70
NA,pandemic of the 21st century indicates that it,70
NA,is no longer possible to contain the virus in,70
NA,particular geographical area. There are now,70
NA,"nearly 30,000 cases of human swine influ-",70
NA,"enza around the world, with 74 countries",70
NA,affected. The World Health Organisation,70
NA,"considers that this pandemic, at least in its",70
NA,"early stages, will be of moderate severity.",70
NA,"Around the world, and as we are seeing here",70
NA,"in Australia, the overwhelming majority of",70
NA,patients experience mild symptoms and will,70
NA,make a rapid and full recovery. This of,70
NA,course is an important factor to be weighed,70
NA,in the public health advice that is being pro-,70
NA,vided to the community.,70
NA,"However, as we also know, the disease has",70
NA,a hard edge with potentially severe compli-,70
NA,cations for people with underlying health,70
NA,"conditions such as morbid obesity, respira-",70
NA,"tory conditions and chronic disease and, like",70
NA,"the regular flu, for pregnant women. Increas-",70
NA,"ingly the world's focus, like our focus, is",70
NA,moving to identifying and treating those,70
NA,most at risk of severe complications. I do,70
NA,need to report to the House that we have,70
NA,"heard the first reports in the media, as yet",70
NA,"unconfirmed, of the first death in the United",70
NA,"Kingdom, which would be the first death",70
NA,"outside the Americas, underscoring the point",70
NA,that this disease can have severe conse-,70
NA,"quences, although it is expected to be mild to",70
NA,moderate in most.,70
NA,Australia has about six per cent of the,70
NA,world's confirmed cases. Here in Australia as,70
NA,"at 12 noon today there were 1,762 confirmed",70
NA,"cases-1,210 in Victoria, 191 in New South",70
NA,"Wales, 116 in Queensland, 63 in South Aus-",70
NA,"tralia, 66 in Western Australia, 32 in Tasma-",70
NA,"nia, 53 in the ACT and 31 in the Northern",70
NA,Territory. There are 10 people currently in,70
NA,"hospital, three of whom are in intensive care.",70
NA,The hospitalised have generally been those,70
NA,people with existing conditions or complica-,70
NA,tions such as morbid obesity and respiratory,70
NA,conditions. A number of schools and child-,70
NA,"care centres are closed around the country,",70
NA,a particularly in those states other than Victoria,70
NA,that are still in the ‘contain' phase.,70
NA,Australia's current approach to swine flu,71
NA,is consistent with the World Health Organi-,71
NA,sation's recommendation that countries,71
NA,should now focus on treating those who are,71
NA,"ill, providing guidance to people to protect",71
NA,"themselves, closely monitoring the disease",71
NA,and adjusting the response to local condi-,71
NA,tions. This is what is already occurring in,71
NA,Australia and underpins the government's,71
NA,public health advice to the community. In,71
NA,"particular, this is consistent with what is oc-",71
NA,"curring in Victoria, with that state on a modi-",71
NA,fied ‘sustain' alert level. I need to advise the,71
NA,House that we continue to give ongoing con-,71
NA,sideration to the appropriateness of Austra-,71
NA,lia's national alert level. The rest of the,71
NA,"try remains at ‘contain', where efforts are",71
NA,continuing with a focus on slowing the,71
NA,"spread of the disease, which is why we are",71
NA,still seeing school closures in states other,71
NA,"than Victoria. Of course, this is something",71
NA,that will continue to be reviewed day by day,71
NA,and hour by hour on the advice of the Chief,71
NA,Medical Officer as well as the Australian,71
NA,Health Protection Committee and the Na-,71
NA,tional Pandemic Emergency Committee.,71
NA,"I do need to flag that, as the number of",71
NA,"cases in Australia steadily increases, the gov-",71
NA,"ernment, in conjunction with the states and",71
NA,"territories, will give further consideration to",71
NA,moving to a consistent alert level across Aus-,71
NA,tralia and to modifying our response to take,71
NA,account of the increasing number of cases in,71
NA,our community and the moderate severity to,71
NA,"date. In particular, we will continue to care-",71
NA,fully monitor the extent of community,71
NA,"transmission-that is, cases with no known",71
NA,contact with other confirmed cases. From the,71
NA,data over the weekend the majority of cases,71
NA,outside Victoria can still be traced back to,71
NA,known contacts with other confirmed cases.,71
NA,"But this is changing, and we will continue to",71
NA,monitor it closely over the coming days.,71
NA,I take this opportunity to remind Austra-,71
NA,lians that the World Health Organisation and,71
NA,the government do not recommend the clo-,71
NA,sure of any borders or travel restrictions dur-,71
NA,ing the pandemic. But the community must,71
NA,be aware that Australians travelling abroad,71
NA,are required to adhere not only to the laws of,71
NA,other countries but also to their health and,71
NA,quarantine arrangements. The Smartraveller,71
NA,website provides advice to this effect for,71
NA,those who are considering travel overseas.,71
NA,Although Australians are being encour-,71
NA,aged to continue to undertake normal day-to-,71
NA,"day activities, I know this is going to be dif-",71
NA,"ficult for some people, particularly as the",71
NA,consequences of voluntary exclusion from,71
NA,school and school closures have an impact,71
NA,counon family life. These school measures are,71
NA,being maintained in states in the ‘contain',71
NA,"phase as an agreed, effective way to slow the",71
NA,spread of the disease in the community.,71
NA,I want to take the opportunity to again,71
NA,"thank the public, and parents in particular,",71
NA,"for their forbearance in this difficult period,",71
NA,which we know can cause family inconven-,71
NA,ience. I would also like to take the opportu-,71
NA,nity to again thank doctors and other health,71
NA,officials for their ongoing efforts and atten-,71
NA,tion in a pandemic which is going to con-,71
NA,tinue to add a significant burden to their al-,71

Mr BRIGGS ,3.49 pm)-My question is,71
NA,to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer explain,71
NA,why a $900 cash-splash cheque from the,71
NA,Reserve Bank to Mrs Gloria Hartridge has,71
NA,"bounced, resulting in a $9 dishonour fee to",71
NA,"this hardworking mother? Treasurer, has the",71
NA,government run out of money?,71
NA,"Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a",71
NA,point of order under the standing orders.,71
NA,Have they run out of questions?,71
The SPEAKER,Order! There is no,71
NA,point of order. There have been a number of,71
NA,"questions that, on literal interpretation of the",71
NA,"standing orders, have been outside the stand-",72
NA,ing orders.,72
Mr SWAN,I am happy to look at the de-,72
NA,"tails, as usual. Whether what the member",72
NA,"says is true or not, I do not know, but I am",72
NA,happy to-,72
NA,Ms Julie Bishop interjecting-,72
Mr SWAN,"Well, that would be a",72
NA,"change, wouldn't it! That would be a dra-",72
NA,matic change from what we have been seeing,72
NA,in the House over a long period of time. This,72
NA,crew opposite will go to enormous lengths to,72
NA,try and discredit the importance of economic,72
NA,stimulus and what it has done to support em-,72
NA,ployment and business in the Australian,72
NA,economy. They will go to any lengths-they,72
NA,"will say anything, they will do anything and",72
NA,they will distort anything-to try and cast,72
NA,some doubt on the effectiveness of economic,72
NA,"stimulus, which has been of such benefit to",72
NA,so many people in this community who have,72
NA,been employed and so many businesses out,72
NA,there who really need customers coming,72
NA,through the door. But they simply do not get,72
NA,"it. I am happy to follow up the details, but it",72
NA,does not in any way absolve any of those,72
NA,opposite from their irresponsibility in voting,72
NA,against what has been absolutely critical for,72
NA,the Australian economy in our time of need.,72
NA,FIFA World Cup Bid,72
Mr CRAIG THOMSON ,3.51 pm)-My,72
NA,question is to the Minister for Early Child-,72
NA,"hood Education, Childcare and Youth and",72
NA,Minister for Sport. Will the minister update,72
NA,the House on Australia's bid for the 2018-22,72
NA,FIFA World Cup?,72
Ms KATE ELLIS,I thank the member,72
NA,for his question and I would of course be,72
NA,delighted to update the House on the exciting,72
NA,developments with the official launch of the,72
NA,World Cup bid yesterday. Before doing that I,72
NA,would like to take the opportunity to place,72
NA,on the parliamentary record the Australian,72
NA,government's congratulations to Football,72
NA,"Federation Australia, to Pim Verbeek, to cap-",72
NA,tain Lucas Neill and of course to the phe-,72
NA,nomenal Socceroos on their recent historic,72
NA,qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. I,72
NA,know that the whole parliament will join in,72
NA,adding their congratulations. This achieve-,72
NA,ment should not be underestimated. It is after,72
NA,all only the third time that Australia has,72
NA,qualified to compete with the best of the best,72
NA,on the world stage in this sport. But it is also,72
NA,the first time that we have been able to go,72
NA,"back-to-back, and the manner in which we",72
NA,did it was without conceding a single goal,72
NA,"and we qualified with two games remaining,",72
NA,all of which make it a truly remarkable,72
NA,achievement.,72
NA,The Socceroos have shown that Australia,72
NA,has become a major player on the world,72
NA,stage when it comes to football. This was,72
NA,also demonstrated yesterday with the official,72
NA,launch of our FIFA World Cup bid. I know,72
NA,that the official launch of our bid was at-,72
NA,tended by members from both sides of the,72
NA,House and quite literally brought football,72
NA,into the parliament. When the bid was,72
NA,"launched by the Prime Minister yesterday,",72
NA,the message that Australia sent to the world,72
NA,was clear: Australia is ready and we want the,72
NA,world to come and play on our home turf. I,72
NA,would like to particularly note the contribu-,72
NA,tion that the Leader of the Opposition made,72
NA,yesterday when he stated that the bid had,72
NA,‘the unequivocal support' of both sides of the,72
NA,House and that the opposition and the gov-,72
NA,"ernment will be ‘side by side, joined at the",72
NA,"hip, as dual strikers' to bring the World Cup",72
NA,to Australia. I think it is important that we,72
NA,"note that, on these major international ven-",72
NA,"tures, this parliament does work together",72
NA,very productively because we know that bi-,72
NA,partisanship is crucial to the success of the,72
NA,prized goal.,72
NA,"We also know that, beyond politics, the",72
NA,involvement and the inclusion of the com-,72
NA,munity is crucial. We need to show the whole,72
NA,world that as a community we are united,73
NA,"behind this bid, and the community will be",73
NA,included with a strong role to play,73
NA,tle going forward. Chairman Frank Lowy,73
NA,announced yesterday that we want the com-,73
NA,munity to play their role as thousands of in-,73
NA,"dividual ambassadors. Already, one Face-",73
NA,book site that is dedicated to supporting Aus-,73
NA,tralia's bid to host the 2018-22 World Cup,73
NA,"now has over 80,000 people registered as",73
NA,"members. In fact, just prior to",73
NA,received an email from the Subiaco Junior,73
NA,"Soccer Club under-15s, who were offering to",73
NA,be-,73
NA,Ms Julie Bishop-A wonderful team.,73
Ms KATE ELLIS,I am sure they are a,73
NA,wonderful team. In fact they are travelling,73
NA,overseas to compete in Sweden later this,73
NA,year. They have offered to act as ambassa-,73
NA,dors for Australia's bid on the world stage.,73
NA,This is an offer that we will certainly take,73
NA,them up on. I would like to call on all Aus-,73
NA,tralians to get involved and log onto the,73
NA,"newly launched website, www.australia2018-",73
NA,"2022.com.au, to register their support for our",73
NA,bid and to get behind the campaign to show,73
NA,to the entire world that there is no better,73
NA,place on the planet to hold the World Cup,73
NA,"than right here in Australia, because there is",73
NA,no doubt that there is a lot of hard work that,73
NA,lies before us from this point on.,73
NA,We also know that there are significant,73
NA,benefits in terms of infrastructure and job,73
NA,creation and of course massive benefits in,73
NA,terms of tourism potential. So we as a gov-,73
NA,ernment will continue to work very hard to,73
NA,"support Frank Lowy, Ben Buckley and Foot-",73
NA,ball Federation Australia. We will work on a,73
NA,coordinated approach across government but,73
NA,we will also be working in very strong part-,73
NA,"nership with all of the states and territories,",73
NA,which have signed up to supporting the bid,73
NA,through COAG. Australia will be making its,73
NA,"first presentation before FIFA later this year,",73
NA,"in December, before submitting the formal",73
NA,"bid in May of next year, with a decision be-",73
NA,in the bating made in December next year.,73
NA,We know that the competition is very tight,73
NA,but we also know that when it comes to host-,73
NA,ing major sporting events there is nobody in,73
NA,the world that does it better than Australia.,73
NA,Together we will work on a united and inclu-,73
NA,sive bid to show to the whole world that Aus-,73
NA,tralia will put on the best World Cup the,73
NA,question time I world has ever seen.,73

Ms GILLARD ,Lalor-Minister for Edu-,73

NA,place Relations and Minister for Social In-,73
NA,"clusion) (3.57 pm)- Mr Speaker, I seek the",73
NA,indulgence of the chair to add to an answer.,73
The SPEAKER,The minister may pro-,73
NA,ceed.,73
Ms GILLARD,I seek to add to an an-,73
NA,swer asked of me by the shadow minister for,73
NA,"education, when he was in the parliament",73
NA,"earlier, which related to the Hastings Public",73
NA,School. The assertion in the member's ques-,73
NA,tion was that somehow the cost for a covered,73
NA,outdoor learning area had increased tenfold,73
NA,in just six years. Can I clarify the matter as,73
NA,follows: the Hastings Public School in New,73
NA,"South Wales has certainly received $400,000",73
NA,for the construction of a covered outdoor,73
NA,learning area. This is a significant building,73
NA,with a solid roof. It also includes an amphi-,73
NA,"theatre, seating and a sound system to facili-",73
NA,tate school assemblies and performances and,73
NA,science and art work spaces.,73
NA,I do not know whether the member was,73
NA,seeking to assert that in 2003 the Hastings,73
NA,"Public School had received $40,000 for some",73
NA,shadecloth. I do not have a record of that.,74
NA,What I think is quite likely to have happened,74
NA,is that the shadow minister has become con-,74
NA,fused between the Hastings Public School in,74
NA,New South Wales and Hastings Primary,74
NA,School in Victoria. If he has become con-,74
NA,fused on that basis let me take the opportu-,74
NA,nity to explain to him that they are two dif-,74
NA,ferent schools in two different states.,74
NA,The Hastings Public School in New South,74
NA,"Wales, which is so ably represented in this",74
NA,"parliament by the member for Lyne, also",74
NA,received funding of $2.6 million for new,74
NA,classroom construction. I understand from,74
NA,him that he is very well aware of the views,74
NA,of the school. They are delighted with the,74
NA,funding for the covered outdoor learning,74
NA,area. The principal has also informed me that,74
NA,"he is a semifinalist in The Einstein Factor,",74
NA,with the topic of Franklin Roosevelt-,74
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,74
Ms GILLARD,I know that wishing a,74
NA,principal well is just too much for the oppo-,74
NA,sition to do; it is too hard!,74
NA,"Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a",74
NA,point of order on relevance. This is going far,74
NA,beyond just the indulgence of adding to an,74
NA,answer to a question. The Deputy Prime,74
NA,Minister is getting on to areas that are totally,74
NA,irrelevant to any question asked of her in,74
NA,question time and she should be sat down.,74
The SPEAKER,The Deputy Leader of,74
NA,the Opposition will resume her seat. The,74
NA,Deputy Prime Minister is adding to an an-,74
NA,swer.,74
Ms GILLARD,I know that it is beyond,74
NA,the charity of heart of the opposition to wish,74
NA,a school principal well in The Einstein Fac-,74
NA,"tor, but I most certainly do, and I am sure",74
NA,that members of the government and the In-,74
NA,"dependents do, including the local member",74
NA,"opposite. I am sure that, in studying Franklin",74
NA,Roosevelt for The Einstein Factor competi-,74

NA,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,74
Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR ,Gorton-,74
NA,Minister for Home Affairs) (4.00 pm)- Mr,74
NA,"Speaker, I wish to make a personal explana-",74
NA,tion.,74
The SPEAKER,Does the honourable,74
NA,member claim to have been misrepresented?,74
Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,Yes.,74
The SPEAKER,Please proceed.,74
Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,The,74
NA,Daily Telegraph yesterday alleged that a staff,74
NA,member of my electorate office had placed,74
NA,his APH address on his private blog and that,74
NA,his private blog was linked to a pornographic,74
NA,blog. The staff member in question did inad-,74
NA,"vertently place his APH address on his blog,",74
NA,for which he has been counselled.,74
NA,"Mr Truss- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point",74
NA,of order. This part of the program of the par-,74
NA,liament is designed for members to explain,74
NA,where they have been personally misrepre-,74
NA,"sented, not their staff.",74
The SPEAKER,I will listen to the min-,74
NA,ister and for the way in which this relates to,74
NA,him.,74
Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,The APH,74
NA,address has been removed from his blog.,74
NA,However-,74
NA,Ms Julie Bishop-How does this relate to,74
NA,you?,74
Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,Because,74
NA,the heading of the article is ‘Minister embar-,74
NA,rassed'.,74
NA,"Ms Julie Bishop-Well, aren't you?",74
Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,You are,74
NA,embarrassing; that is what you are.,74
The SPEAKER,Order! The minister,74
NA,will resume his seat. Those on my left will,74
NA,cease interjecting. The minister has the call.,74
Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,,75
NA,"However, it is untrue that his private blog",75
NA,was linked to a pornographic site. The site,75
NA,referred to in the article is called Awkward-,75
NA,FamilyPhotos and it is currently linked to,75
NA,"many public sites, including, would you be-",75
NA,"lieve it, the Daily Telegraph site. On 19 May,",75
NA,the Daily Telegraph website described the,75
NA,"site as ‘taking the world by storm, allowing",75
NA,readers to post cringe-worthy family por-,75
NA,"traits, along with witty captions and head-",75
NA,lines'. I table the Daily Telegraph website,75
NA,page that links to the site in question. I am,75
NA,confident that this now clears up any misun-,75
NA,derstanding by the Daily Telegraph and the,75
NA,journalist involved.,75
NA,Ms Julie Bishop-That was an abuse of,75
NA,the processes of the parliament.,75
The SPEAKER,An abuse of the proc-,75
NA,esses of the parliament is to sit there and insuspects.,75
NA,terject. I indicate that perhaps that might,75
NA,"have been wide of the mark, but, given that",75
NA,the minister is a portfolio minister in the,75
NA,"torney-General's Department, it may have",75

NA,pm)-by leave-On 12 June 2009 in a joint,75
NA,"media release with the foreign minister, the",75
NA,"Hon. Stephen Smith MP, I announced that",75
NA,Australia has strengthened its commitment to,75
NA,international efforts to combat piracy off the,75
NA,Horn of Africa. Australia will provide,75
NA,"$500,000, as well as skills and expertise, to",75
NA,the joint European Commission/United Na-,75
NA,tions Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC),75
NA,Counter Piracy Program to assist Kenyan,75
NA,authorities in receiving and processing ap-,75
NA,prehended piracy suspects.,75
NA,Australia will provide an official through,75
NA,the Office of the Inspector of Transport Se-,75
NA,curity and the Australian Federal Police to,75
NA,work with the UNODC in the Nairobi office,75
NA,in Kenya in dealing with piracy in the region.,75
NA,"The international community, and particu-",75
NA,"larly the UNODC, recognises that, if an ef-",75
NA,fective deterrent is to be created in the prose-,75
NA,"cution of suspected pirates, there needs to be",75
NA,a capacity for the legal processing to occur,75
NA,within the north-east African region. The,75
NA,official will work with local authorities in,75
NA,Kenya in dealing with apprehended piracy,75
NA,This is one of a range of measures under-,75
NA,taken by the Australian government to com-,75
NA,Atbat the growing international problem of pi-,75
NA,racy. International Maritime Bureau figures,75
NA,show that more than 100 ships were attacked,75
NA,and 42 hijacked in the Gulf of Aden and the,75
NA,Somalia region in 2008. There have been,75
NA,around 60 attacks and 25 successful hijack-,75
NA,ings this year. Piracy is an issue that impacts,75
NA,"on the entire international community, as the",75
NA,attack on the Italian cruise ship MSC Melody,75
NA,"in April demonstrated. With over 1,500 pas-",75
NA,"sengers and crew, including 74 Australians,",75
NA,the Melody was attacked by pirates in a,75
NA,speedboat at least 600 miles from the Somali,75
NA,coast-a practical demonstration that this,75
NA,issue is a global one that affects every coun-,75
NA,try.,75
NA,The threat of piracy needs to be taken se-,75
NA,"riously, especially by countries such as Aus-",75
NA,"tralia, which relies almost exclusively on",75
NA,international shipping for our exports and,75
NA,imports. With 99 percent of our exports by,75
NA,"volume being transported by sea, a safe and",75
NA,secure maritime industry is paramount-to,76
NA,"our economy, to our maritime industry and to",76
NA,the safety of many Australians who travel,76
NA,through international waters each year.,76
NA,"In May this year, the government an-",76
NA,nounced that Australia would contribute Aus-,76
NA,tralian Defence Force resources to interna-,76
NA,tional anti-piracy efforts off the Horn of,76
NA,rica. Our contribution includes the tasking of,76
NA,our Navy Anzac-class frigate and RAAF,76
NA,"AP3C Orion patrol aircraft, which are al-",76
NA,ready contributing to counterterrorism activi-,76
NA,ties in the region. Flexible employment of,76
NA,our assets across several coalition task forces locations.,76
NA,allows the ADF to contribute in an agile way,76
NA,to the highest priority activity. It is broadly,76
NA,recognised that the best long-term solution to,76
NA,the problem of piracy is to restore peace and,76
NA,stability in the Horn of Africa.,76
NA,At the international conference on Soma-,76
NA,"lia in Brussels on 22-23 April this year, the",76
NA,government committed $2 million in security,76
NA,and humanitarian assistance to support inter-,76
NA,national efforts to restore peace to Somalia.,76
NA,The United Nations estimates that over half,76
NA,the population of Somalia is in need of hu-,76
NA,manitarian assistance and that one in six So-,76
NA,mali children under five is acutely malnour-,76

NA,Australia will contribute $1.5 million to,76
NA,"the United Nations Humanitarian Appeal,",76
NA,which will go towards security protection for,76
NA,humanitarian workers in Somalia to support,76
NA,"vital health services for women and children,",76

NA,"in Somalia, which is aiming to help Soma-",76

NA,It was a result of the conduct of his in-,77

NA,effective international forums such as the,77
NA,International Maritime Organisation and the,77
NA,United Nations to deal with the threat of in-,77

NA,I met with the head of the International,77
NA,"Maritime Organisation, Admiral Mitropou-",77
NA,"los, at the IMO headquarters in London on 1",77
NA,"April this year. At that meeting, he made a",77
NA,request for Australia's direct participation in,77
NA,these activities. I am pleased that the gov-,77
NA,ernment have been able to deliver in these,77
NA,small but important measures to make sure,77
NA,"that, once again, we are taking our place as",77
NA,good international citizens when it comes to,77
NA,international maritime issues.,77
NA,I want to acknowledge the presence in the,77
NA,parliament today of the Minister for Foreign,77
NA,"Affairs for Kenya, Moses Wetang'ula, and",77
NA,the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Co-,77
NA,"operation of the Republic of Rwanda, Mrs",77
NA,Rosemary Museminali. Both of these minis-,77
NA,ters have expressed their support and grati-,77
NA,tude for Australia making this commitment.,77
NA,This threat of piracy directly affects the,77
NA,lives of Australians travelling through this,77
NA,region and our economic interests that are,77
NA,reliant on the safety and security of interna-,77
NA,tional shipping.,77
NA,I ask leave of the House to move a motion,77
NA,to enable the Leader of the Nationals to,77
NA,speak for 10 minutes.,77
NA,Leave granted.,77
Mr ALBANESE,I move:,77
NA,That so much of standing and sessional orders,77

NA,utes.,77
NA,Question agreed to.,77
Mr TRUSS ,Wide Bay-Leader of the,77
NA,Nationals) (4.07 pm)-This ministerial,77
NA,statement from the Minister for Infrastruc-,77
NA,"ture, Transport, Regional Development and",77
NA,Local Government is fundamentally just a,77
NA,repeat of a press release made on 12 June.,77
NA,The minister's leaving the chamber demon-,77
NA,strates that he is also not too interested in any,77
NA,"kind of response to his statement and is,",77
NA,"therefore, taking a further step in devaluing",77
NA,the importance of ministerial statements to,77
NA,the chamber. This statement is about a grant,77
NA,"of $500,000. Many important things happen",78
NA,in the parliament and many important things,78
NA,"happen in our country, and it is appropriate",78
NA,that there be ministerial statements to deal,78
NA,"with these issues; but, when the minister",78
NA,does not even think it is necessary to remain,78
NA,in the chamber to listen to the reply to his,78
NA,"statement, it is quite clear that he does not",78
NA,give this matter very high priority.,78
NA,That is disappointing because the issue of,78
NA,piracy on the high seas is an important issue.,78
NA,Whether this government's contribution will,78
NA,make a significant difference to the level of,78
NA,"piracy around the world remains to be seen,",78
NA,but the issue of piracy itself is an important,78
NA,one and deserving of parliamentary debating,78
NA,time. It is a dangerous threat to global mari-,78
NA,time security. It threatens the livelihood of,78
NA,"ship-borne commerce, which is the backbone",78
NA,"of world trade. The overwhelming majority,",78
NA,"by volume, of Australia's trade is carried by",78
NA,"ships and, therefore, it is important to us as",78
NA,nation that shipping trade be safe and secure.,78
NA,The risk of piracy means that ships are some-,78
NA,times forced to take longer routes around,78
NA,dangerous zones and it certainly slows down,78
NA,the delivery and reliability of delivery of sea,78
NA,carried goods.,78
NA,The activities of pirates in the Gulf of,78
NA,Aden are of considerable concern threaten-,78
NA,"ing, as they do, Australia's merchant trade",78
NA,and threatening Australian sailors and tour-,78
NA,ists passing through the gulf and the Suez,78
NA,"Canal. The Suez Canal is, of course, an im-",78
NA,portant funnel for international trade. A very,78
NA,large proportion of maritime traffic moves,78
NA,through that canal and therefore ships mov-,78
NA,ing up the Gulf of Aden are particularly vul-,78
NA,nerable to attack from pirates. It is perhaps a,78
NA,commentary on the audacity of some of the,78
NA,piracy activity that is occurring at the present,78
NA,time that it is happening under the nose of a,78
NA,considerable naval presence and despite the,78
NA,fact that the presence of these pirates from,78
NA,Somalia is well known to the maritime,78
NA,community. The very presence of these pi-,78
NA,"rates, particularly those coming from some",78
NA,of the countries in Africa where there is an,78
NA,"acute shortage of food and other supplies, is",78
NA,a particular irony because the pirate activities,78
NA,threaten the delivery of food and aid to some,78
NA,of the poorest countries in Africa. This was,78
NA,illustrated with the seizure of the Maersk,78
NA,Alabama in April this year. That ship was,78
NA,"carrying 5,000 metric tonnes of relief sup-",78
NA,"plies for Somalia, Kenya and Uganda. Those",78
NA,who felt that intercepting this trade was in,78
NA,some way acceptable behaviour were not,78
NA,thinking of the impact on their fellow citi-,78
NA,zens in Somalia and other impoverished,78
NA,people in Kenya and Uganda.,78
NA,I understand that Somali pirates received,78
NA,over US$150 million in ransom in the 12,78
NA,months prior to November 2008. Pirates op-,78
NA,erating from Somalia have attacked more,78
NA,than 100 vessels in waters off the African,78
NA,"a coast in the past year, including cruise liners,",78
NA,a fully laden supertanker and a ship laden,78
NA,with Russian tanks. As the minister pointed,78
NA,"out, much is already being done by the inter-",78
NA,national community to address this scourge.,78
NA,"According to public reports, the European",78
NA,Union has a task force of six warships and,78
NA,three surveillance aircraft from eight coun-,78
NA,tries patrolling one million square kilometres,78
NA,of the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden.,78
NA,The United States is making a contribution,78
NA,"with its Fifth Fleet based in Bahrain. India,",78
NA,"Russia, Malaysia and others are also provid-",78
NA,"ing warships. Australia, too, is making its",78
NA,contribution. The recent successful assis-,78
NA,tance provided by HMAS Sydney and,78
NA,HMAS Ballarat in protecting MV Dubai,78
NA,Princess south of Yemen from an attack by,78
NA,pirates is an example. The deployment of the,78
NA,Anzac frigate with the assistance of the,78
NA,RAAF AP3C Orion maritime aircraft is a,78
NA,welcome contribution to this international,78
NA,"effort. This effort will have to continue, as",78
NA,the success of the international task force is,78
NA,driving the activities of the pirates further,79
NA,"south, increasing the threat to sea lanes and",79
NA,expanding the area of ocean that will need to,79
NA,be patrolled.,79
NA,A policy of effective interdiction provided,79
NA,by a substantial and robust international na-,79
NA,val presence in the waters east of Africa is,79
NA,essential part of the strategy to deal with,79
NA,threat of Somalia based piracy. This is a plus.,79
NA,It will require a concerted effort to rebuild,79
NA,the shattered national institutions of Somalia,79
NA,if there is to be a long-term solution. Unfor-,79
NA,"tunately, this hastily cobbled together effort",79
NA,from the government in dealing with this,79
NA,complex problem raises more questions than,79
NA,it answers. The ministerial statement pro-,79
NA,vides very little additional information on,79
NA,"what this money is going to be spent on,",79
NA,where it is coming from and what the objec-,79
NA,tives of this assistance actually are. We are,79
NA,"told it is going to provide $500,000, as well",79
NA,"as skills and expertise, to the joint European",79
NA,Commission and United Nations Office of,79
NA,Drugs and Crime Counter Piracy Program to,79
NA,assist Kenyan authorities in receiving and,79
NA,apprehending piracy suspects. Australia is to,79
NA,provide an official through the Office of the,79
NA,Inspector of Transport Security and the Aus-,79
NA,tralian Federal Police to work with the,79
NA,UNODC in the Nairobi office in Kenya deal-,79
NA,ing with piracy in the region. We are not,79
NA,provided with any information as to how this,79
NA,money is going to be spent beyond that it is,79
NA,going to provide some kind of judicial sup-,79
NA,port for Kenyan authorities. The minister has,79
NA,not explained how this money will reduce,79
NA,"the threat of piracy. Likewise, we do not",79
NA,know what the Australian government offi-,79
NA,cial will do. The government has not even,79
NA,made it clear where the official will come,79
NA,"from, whether from the Office of the Inspec-",79
NA,tor of Transport Security or from the Austra-,79
NA,lian Federal Police. The details are not there.,79
NA,"Frankly, this statement has all the hall-",79
NA,marks of another piece of spin supporting the,79
NA,Prime Minister's ego driven bid for a tempo-,79
NA,rary seat on the United Nations Security,79
NA,Council. We have seen far too much of this,79
NA,extraordinary focus of the Prime Minister on,79
NA,"securing this particular seat, a campaign that",79
NA,is consuming the resources of the Depart-,79
NA,an ment of Foreign Affairs and Trade and dis-,79
NA,the tracting the government from its requirement,79
NA,to advance and protect the interest of Austra-,79
NA,lians overseas. It is not even clear from the,79
NA,minister's statement whether the funding for,79
NA,this announcement is going to come from his,79
NA,"own department, the Department of Infra-",79
NA,"structure, Transport, Regional Development",79
NA,"and Local Government, or the Department of",79
NA,"Foreign Affairs and Trade, which of course",79
NA,had some significant increases in its budget,79
NA,in the appropriations currently before the,79
NA,parliament.,79
NA,"I would be concerned, in light of all the",79
NA,cutbacks that have occurred in the depart-,79
NA,ment of regional development under the aus-,79
NA,"pices of the current minister, if in fact grants",79
NA,were now going to be provided to Kenya to,79
NA,"deal with Somali pirates, rather than to pro-",79
NA,vide assistance to Australian regional com-,79
NA,munities for which this minister and this de-,79
NA,partment should take primary responsibility.,79
NA,"It would be a disappointment, at this time",79
NA,when he is cutting back road funding and,79
NA,"other expenditure for the regions, if in fact",79
NA,funding were going to be provided towards,79
NA,an anti-piracy program in Somalia. That does,79
NA,not mean that we should not be involved in,79
NA,"seeking to combat piracy in Somalia. But,",79
NA,"clearly, the funding provided should come",79
NA,from the foreign aid budget or under the ac-,79
NA,"tivities of Defence, who can play a useful",79
NA,"role in helping to protect shipping, Australian",79
NA,"and international, in that area. Also, the min-",79
NA,ister made some reference to the working,79
NA,"group on piracy in the Malacca straits, a very",79
NA,worthwhile initiative initiated and under-,79
NA,taken during the term of the previous gov-,79
NA,ernment. I am pleased that the current minis-,79
NA,ter is continuing to ensure that Australia de-,80
NA,votes resources to and takes a keen interest,80
NA,in its activities. That area is a particularly,80
NA,important waterway for Australian shipping.,80
NA,A very large proportion of our trade passes,80
NA,through the straits and in dealing with piracy,80
NA,"issues we should be concentrating, as a prior-",80
NA,"ity, on ensuring that they remain safe.",80

NA,Second Reading,80
NA,Debate resumed.,80
Mrs HULL ,Riverina) (4.24 pm)-In,80
NA,continuing my speech on the Health Insur-,80
NA,ance Amendment (Extended Medicare Safety,80
NA,"Net) Bill 2009, I would like to bring to the",80
NA,attention of the House many of the issues,80
NA,that come under this bill and the areas that,80
NA,will be capped. Not all of these issues con-,80
NA,cern areas where I believe people are genu-,80
NA,inely putting themselves in a position,80
NA,whereby they are overextending doctors or,80
NA,themselves as to medical issues or are per-,80
NA,haps overextending themselves and they do,80
NA,not require these services.,80
NA,I will look at the issues in respect of,80
NA,people who have assisted reproductive tech-,80
NA,"nology, or ART. In my electoral area cover-",80
NA,"ing Wagga Wagga and the Riverina, there",80
NA,was an assisted reproductive technology ser-,80
NA,vice in Wagga Wagga that took place in the,80
NA,Wagga day surgery. Our regional area people,80
NA,came in there to assist with the IVF and,80
NA,many other assisted reproductive skills that,80
NA,"were provided by a specialist, who set up in",80
NA,Wagga particularly because the day theatre,80
NA,and the day surgery were there. That enabled,80
NA,her to come in and do obstetrics and also,80
NA,practise her passion for assisted reproductive,80
NA,"technology, to benefit many couples who",80
NA,were childless and were assisted by IVF and,80
NA,other procedures.,80
NA,What happened was that when Calvary,80
NA,"Hospital, a Catholic-run hospital, took over,",80
NA,"having bought out the surgery, the theatres",80
NA,"and the day hospital, it no longer allowed",80
NA,that type of activity to take place so now all,80
NA,of those in my region have to travel signifi-,80
NA,cant distances in order to access assisted re-,80
NA,"productive technology, IVF and other assis-",80
NA,tance to be able to have children. The travel,80
NA,cost to them is absolutely astronomical. Gen-,80
NA,"erally, many city people can walk to or get a",80
NA,"bus, a train or a ferry or some other form of",80
NA,public transport to a hospital system or to,80
NA,these kinds of facilities and not be personally,80
NA,"out of pocket-after paying for bus fares,",80
NA,train fares and other public transport fares-,80
NA,to the degree that my constituents are. When,80
NA,"one has got to travel significant distances,",80
NA,you are constantly out of pocket. You might,80
NA,have to stay overnight or to stay two or three,80
NA,nights in order to access these services. If,80
NA,you are staying in a motel it could be ex-,80
NA,tremely expensive.,80
NA,I think that there is a need to recognise the,80
NA,distance factor and the cost factor for many,80
NA,of those people in rural and regional Austra-,80
NA,"lia-and, in my case, in the electorate of",80
NA,Riverina-who simply have to incur costs,80
NA,those just to physically get themselves to these,80
NA,services let alone use them. So I am very,80
NA,concerned that this does not cover all as-,80
NA,sisted reproductive technology services. I,80
NA,think that is simply unfair and quite dis-,80
NA,"criminatory, because it does not recognise",80
NA,"how much money, including out-of-pocket",81
NA,"expenses, regional mums wishing to be",81
NA,mums and families wishing to be families,81
NA,have to spend in trying to access these in the,81
NA,first place.,81
NA,I cannot understand the reasons behind all,81
NA,obstetric services not being covered. I under-,81
NA,"stand that it has been reported that, between",81
NA,"2003 and 2008, the fees charged by obstetri-",81
NA,cians for in-hospital services reduced by six,81
NA,per cent while the fees charged for out-of-,81
NA,hospital services increased by a quite signifi-,81
NA,cant percentage. But I do wonder about peo-,81
NA,ple in those areas where you cannot get into,81
NA,"a hospital. In particular, I am talking about",81
NA,"the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital, which is a",81
NA,referral centre for all of our region and be-,81
NA,yond. It is just so difficult to get into hospital,81
NA,to obtain any of these services. It is simply,81
NA,not possible to access the hospital service for,81
NA,these services. So do you not have the ser-,81
NA,vice at all or do you try to seek it as an out-,81
NA,"of-hospital service? Again, I wonder what",81
NA,considerations have been factored in. I won-,81
NA,der where this is actually coming from. If the,81
NA,specialist has come from a city area or an,81
NA,area that has easy access to hospital services,81
NA,et cetera and those services are not being,81
NA,"utilised, then maybe I can understand it, but I",81
NA,"do wonder, when we are all lumped into one",81
NA,big melting pot and considered as an aggre-,81
NA,"gate or an average, how in such cases we can",81
NA,play a significant part in explaining the is-,81
NA,sues to rural and regional people. I also won-,81
NA,der how much effect this legislation will,81
NA,have in pushing more and more people into,81
NA,the public hospital system where already you,81
NA,cannot access any of those services in rural,81
NA,and regional areas.,81
NA,The one area that concerns me the most-,81
NA,and I spoke about this in the three minutes I,81
NA,had to speak on this bill before question time,81
NA,was called on-is cataract surgery. Only one,81
NA,type of cataract surgery is covered under this,81
NA,bill-and for it to be capped is in itself an,81
NA,issue. It is primarily one of those out-of-,81
NA,hospital services in a day surgery. It may be,81
NA,run on a fly-in fly-out basis or by a person,81
NA,that comes in when there is no ophthalmolo-,81
NA,gist available in the regional areas. It might,81
NA,"be somewhere out in the Broken Hill area,",81
NA,somewhere up the back of Bourke or some-,81
NA,where else. Somebody comes in and does a,81
NA,significant caseload because there is no way,81
NA,to get access to an ophthalmologist unless,81
NA,these people come in. Of course it is going to,81
NA,start to blow out when you have people com-,81
NA,ing in to do significant surgery.,81
NA,I am not saying that there is nobody who,81
NA,will rob or try to rort the safety net system.,81
NA,"Anywhere, in anything you do, there will",81
NA,always be somebody who will do something,81
NA,that they should not be doing. I am not say-,81
NA,ing at all that that does not happen. I would,81
NA,hate to think that people would think that I,81
NA,was so naive as to think that there is not,81
NA,somewhere some abuse taking place of the,81
NA,safety net. But this bill is using a steel-,81
NA,capped boot to squash an ant. The fact is that,81
NA,some people might be abusing the system to,81
NA,"some small degree but, on the other hand,",81
NA,people in rural and regional Australia are,81
NA,affected in the most significant ways. In the,81
NA,most significant ways they will be the ones,81
NA,that will be affected. Will ophthalmologists,81
NA,think it worth their while to take a day or two,81
NA,or three off work-generally a day and a half,81
NA,or more to travel to many of the outposts in,81
NA,Australia; it could be two days of travel each,81
NA,way-and then a day while they are there to,81
NA,undertake that day surgery? With a signifi-,81
NA,"cant cap, will these specialist service provid-",81
NA,ers consider that it is worth while for them to,81
NA,take all of this time out of their practice in,81
NA,order to go and run these day surgeries? It,81
NA,concerns me greatly.,81
NA,"Coupled with this legislation, I understand",81
NA,that there will be further legislation coming,81
NA,into this House on cataract surgery itself. We,81
NA,"have not seen this legislation yet, but I am",81
NA,"led to believe, from a good source, that fur-",82
NA,ther legislation will be coming into the,82
NA,House severely cutting ophthalmology and,82
NA,cataract surgery. I cannot understand it. I am,82
NA,going to read from an email that I have re-,82
NA,ceived from one ophthalmologist in my elec-,82
NA,torate. Ophthalmologists are few and far be-,82
NA,"tween, let me tell you, and are very hard to",82
NA,come by. It is very hard to attract an oph-,82
NA,thalmologist out into country Australia as it,82
NA,"is. With this cap, and with the measures soon",82
NA,"to be introduced into the House, it is going to",82
NA,be nigh on impossible for there to be oph-,82
NA,thalmology services for rural and regional,82
NA,"people, let alone for those people who live",82
NA,out in the wider expanses of Central Austra-,82
NA,"lia, in Broken Hill and other places. This",82
NA,ophthalmologist says that he is writing to,82
NA,make me aware that the government is in-,82
NA,tending to cut the rebate for cataract surgery,82
NA,by 50 per cent. He is not talking about this,82
NA,"Medicare safety net but, coupled with the",82
NA,"Medicare safety net, it is a big hit. He says:",82
NA,Their justification for doing this apparently is,82
NA,because they believe it is too quick and easy to,82
NA,"perform and basically, not worth the money.",82
NA,"Let me tell you, those people who had cata-",82
NA,racts and had to have cataract surgery and are,82
NA,now free of cataracts think it is worth the,82
NA,money. If you lived like that you would soon,82
NA,find out whether it was worth the money. He,82
NA,goes on:,82
NA,Having taken four years of specific eye surgical,82
NA,training to master the procedure on top of a medi-,82
NA,cal degree and 3-6 years of hospital residency,82
NA,coupled to the fact that community expectations,82
NA,are for 100% success rates and the stress associ-,82
NA,ated with the procedure is somewhat akin to de-,82
NA,"fusing a bomb through a microscope, we would",82
NA,beg to differ. One wonders if,82
NA,the Prime Minister-,82
NA,Kevin Rudd or-,82
NA,the minister-,82
NA,"Ms Roxon to have their cataract done, whether",82
NA,they will trot down to the local public hospital to,82
NA,sign up to have the junior eye registrar do the,82
NA,procedure or whether they'll seek out the most,82
NA,competent and experienced surgeon in town.,82
NA,He goes on to say:,82
NA,The schedule fee for cataract surgery was around,82
NA,$800 in the early 1980s. The Government halved,82
NA,it back then and again cut it by around 30% in,82
NA,1996. Now they want to cut it in half again. So in,82
NA,late 2009 the fee will be about half what it was,82
NA,over 25 years ago in face dollar terms and allow-,82
NA,"ing for inflation, this puts a real dollar value of",82
NA,about an eighth of what it was back then. In all,82
NA,that time our profession has succeeded in making,82
NA,the procedure quicker but also safer and with a,82
NA,faster recovery time and better visual results. We,82
NA,use a lot more high tech equipment now but this,82
NA,"makes the procedure more complex, more techni-",82
NA,"cally difficult and takes much longer to master, as",82
NA,any training registrar will testify.,82
NA,Basically this ophthalmologist goes on to,82
NA,talk about the public hospital system and,82
NA,why these out-of-hospital cataract operations,82
NA,have expanded. He says it is because you,82
NA,cannot get theatre time in the hospital. In the,82
NA,public hospital system in rural and regional,82
NA,"Australia you cannot get theatre time, so of",82
NA,course they are going to be doing more in,82
NA,day surgeries. He says:,82
NA,Up until about six months ago-,82
NA,that is the end of last year-,82
NA,things were going well for our patients. A pri-,82
NA,vately insured patient would get done with no out,82
NA,of pocket expense from me as I accepted ‘no-gap',82
NA,payments from the funds for my surgery. A pa-,82
NA,tient electing to go public would wait about three,82
NA,months to get done at Wagga Base Hospital. If a,82
NA,"non-insured patient wanted to go private, the all-",82
NA,"up cost would be around $1800 out of pocket,",82
NA,$1100 of which went to the private hospital and,82
NA,the rest split between surgeon and anaesthetist.,82
NA,when it is time for- Since then-,82
NA,and I am talking specifically about the,82
NA,"Greater Southern Area Health Service, which",82
NA,has-,82
NA,… cut our theatre lists back to 3 per month and,82
NA,never seem to have a dedicated theatre for emer-,82
NA,"gencies, so that the lists we do get are sometimes",83
NA,"cancelled for an emergency caesar, trauma case",83
NA,"etc. As a result, my public waiting list has now",83
NA,blown out to eleven months and some of my col-,83
NA,leagues have longer waits. The worst thing is that,83
NA,"the wait list grows by about two months, every",83
NA,month.,83
NA,So this obviously increases the interest and,83
NA,need for people to get their cataracts done,83
NA,outside the hospital system. I was trying to,83
NA,point to whether there is a recognition of the,83
NA,factors that show why there has been more,83
NA,private surgery and why more of these are,83
NA,being done out of hospital. You can see why,83
NA,when you factor in all of the issues and the,83
NA,challenges we are trying to meet in rural and,83
NA,regional areas. He goes on:,83
NA,This will now cost uninsured patients an extra,83
NA,$312 because of the fee cutback-,83
NA,on top of the increases that the hospitals have,83
NA,now applied and-,83
NA,… hospital charges for uninsured cataract cases,83
NA,are now $1300 for pensioners and a whopping,83
NA,$2075 for non-pensioners.,83
NA,He talks about how much there will be out-,83
NA,of-pocket charges for insured patients et cet-,83
NA,"era. The problem we have is, I think, that",83
NA,there has been no thought given to how to,83
NA,address rogue issues. (Time expired),83
Ms OWENS ,Parramatta) (4.40 pm)-I,83
NA,rise to support the Health Insurance Amend-,83
NA,ment (Extended Medicare Safety Net) Bill,83
NA,2009. It is an extremely important bill for the,83
NA,sustainability of the extended Medicare,83
NA,safety net. The purpose of the extended,83
NA,Medicare safety net is to protect patients,83
NA,from high out-of-pocket medical costs for,83
NA,out-of-hospital medical services such as GP,83
NA,and specialist services. Relative to the total,83
NA,health budget it is quite a small component,83
NA,but is an incredibly important one.,83
NA,While most people face out-of-pocket,83
NA,"costs of less than $50 a year, some members",83
NA,of the community face significant medical,83
NA,"bills for out-of-hospital services. In 2007,",83
NA,around seven per cent of individuals had out-,83
NA,of-pocket costs of over $300 per year-add,83
NA,"those up for families. And in 2007, 11,000",83
NA,Australians incurred out-of-pocket costs of,83
NA,"more than $2,000 each. The number of peo-",83
NA,ple with these very high out-of-pocket costs,83
NA,initially fell after the Howard government,83
NA,introduced the EMSN in 2004 but rose very,83
NA,quickly again shortly after that and has been,83
NA,rising since.,83
NA,The benefits are highly concentrated in,83
NA,"certain types of services. In 2007, over 30",83
NA,per cent of all EMSN benefits helped fund,83
NA,obstetric services and 22 per cent went to-,83
NA,wards assisted reproductive services. The,83
NA,EMSN has more than doubled the amount of,83
NA,Commonwealth funding going towards these,83
NA,two professional groups. Only eight per cent,83
NA,of the EMSN benefits went towards the,83
NA,funding of general practice consultations.,83
NA,There is also an extremely effective program,83
NA,directing assistance to cancer patients rela-,83
NA,tive to other patients with high healthcare,83
NA,needs. Given that over 50 per cent of EMSN,83
NA,payments go towards people for obstetric,83
NA,"services, assisted reproductive services and",83
NA,"chronic illnesses, you can see how incredibly",83
NA,important a program it is. It is incredibly,83
NA,important that it is sustainable over the long,83
NA,term so that we can continue to provide as-,83
NA,sistance to people with the greatest need.,83
NA,It is a relatively new program. It was in-,83
NA,troduced by the Howard government in 2004,83
NA,to tackle high out-of-pocket costs for medi-,83
NA,"cal services. Under the EMSN, patients are",83
NA,reimbursed 80 per cent of their out-of-pocket,83
NA,costs for all out-of-hospital Medicare ser-,83
NA,vices once annual personal expenditure on,83
NA,"these reaches a certain threshold, which was",83
NA,indexed annually. Prior to the introduction of,83
NA,"the extended safety net in 2004, there was a",83
NA,limit on the amount of government contribu-,83
NA,tion for services. That was done through the,83
NA,"Medicare schedule fee. In fact, for the first",83
NA,eight or nine years of the Howard govern-,83
NA,"ment, contributions to this area were capped",84
NA,by those Medicare schedule fees. But in,84
NA,2004 that cap was removed and instead 80,84
NA,per cent of out-of-pocket costs or out-of-,84
NA,hospital services were paid no matter how,84
NA,much the doctor charged. You would expect,84
NA,"that, if you removed the cap in that way,",84
NA,there would be some doctors and specialists,84
NA,who would increase their fees or who would,84
NA,"think: ‘Okay, I can increase my fee by 50 per",84
NA,"cent, or 80 per cent or whatever, and it will",84
NA,still be paid by the 80 per cent contribution,84
NA,for out-of-pocket costs.' Some did and costs,84
NA,"started to rise, and between 2007 and 2008",84
NA,they rose 30 per cent.,84
NA,That rise in the spending on EMSN bene-,84
NA,fits has not been matched by a drop in pa-,84
NA,"tients' out-of-pocket costs. In fact, since its",84
NA,introduction there have been concerns that,84
NA,the EMSN may lead providers to increase,84
NA,fees and thereby dilute the potential benefits,84
NA,to patients. Since the introduction of the,84
NA,"EMSN, average fees have increased by",84
NA,"around 4.2 per cent per year, excluding gen-",84
NA,"eral practice and pathology, which have been",84
NA,fairly stable. This increase is over and above,84
NA,the rate of inflation and it is estimated that,84
NA,the EMSN is responsible for 70 per cent of,84
NA,the increase. It was directly responsible for,84
NA,2.9 per cent increase in fees each year. It,84
NA,comes a question of whether the taxpayer,84
NA,should pick up the increase in fees by the,84
NA,specialists.,84
NA,The rise in costs was also of concern to,84
NA,"the Howard government. In fact, in 2005,",84
NA,just one year after the scheme was intro-,84
NA,"duced, concerns were such about the charg-",84
NA,ing of excessive fees by some doctors that,84
NA,the government raised the safety net expen-,84
NA,diture threshold so as to reduce the number,84
NA,of people who would qualify for the EMSN,84
NA,and rein in costs. They did not consider cap-,84
NA,ping again at that stage but they did raise,84
NA,"threshold, which meant that people had to",84
NA,spend more of their own money before be-,84
NA,coming eligible. It reduced access to the,84
NA,scheme. The original thresholds were set at,84
NA,$300 for concession card holders and FTBA,84
NA,"recipients, and $700 for all others. Those",84
NA,"were increased to $500 and $1,000 in 2005.",84
NA,"After indexation, the thresholds now sit at",84
NA,$555.70 for concession card holders and,84
NA,people who receive family tax benefit part A,84
NA,"and $1,111.60 for all other singles and fami-",84
NA,lies. But costs still continue to rise. Consis-,84
NA,tent with the fact that people in affluent areas,84
NA,"incur more out-of-pocket costs, it was found",84
NA,that some 55 per cent of EMSN benefits is,84
NA,distributed to the top quintile of Australia's,84
NA,"most socioeconomically advantaged areas,",84
NA,whereas the least advantaged quintile re-,84
NA,"ceives less than 3.5 per cent. That is, 55 per",84
NA,cent for the top quintile and 3.5 per cent for,84
NA,the lowest.,84
NA,In rural areas costs have not increased in,84
NA,"the same way. Over time, average out-of-",84
NA,"pocket costs increased most in major cities,",84
NA,although the median in the major cities was,84
NA,"quite stable, which suggests that the higher",84
NA,out-of-pocket costs in major cities are faced,84
NA,by those at the upper end of the distribution.,84
NA,"Interestingly enough, over time the differ-",84
NA,ence between the average and the medium is,84
NA,"a actually increasing, showing that the differ-",84
NA,beence between the highest-charging specialist,84
NA,and the average-charging specialist has in-,84
NA,creased dramatically.,84
NA,We know a lot about the nature of the ris-,84
NA,ing costs because there has been extensive,84
NA,"review of the program, with a report coming",84
NA,down in 2009. As required under the Health,84
NA,Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Act,84
NA,"2004, a review was undertaken of the opera-",84
NA,"tion, effectiveness and implication of the",84
NA,safety net. That was conducted by the Centre,84
NA,for Health Economics Research and Evalua-,84
NA,tion at the University of Technology in Syd-,84
NA,the ney. The report noted that the safety net has,84
NA,helped patients who have very high costs and,84
NA,has reduced out-of-pocket costs for some,84
NA,"patients with cancer, but it clearly showed",85
NA,that there were major concerns in areas such,85
NA,as obstetrics and assisted reproductive tech-,85
NA,"nology, including IVF. Fifty per cent of the",85
NA,safety net benefits are paid in those two ar-,85
NA,eas. Medicare benefits have more than dou-,85
NA,bled for both these groups since the safety,85
NA,net was introduced. A significant proportion,85
NA,of the increase in expenditure is because of,85
NA,the increases in fees charged.,85
NA,There is also a substantial difference be-,85
NA,tween in-hospital and out-of-hospital fees.,85
NA,"Between 2003 and 2008, the fees charged by",85
NA,obstetricians for in-hospital services reduced,85
NA,by six per cent while the fees charged for,85
NA,out-of-hospital services increased by 267 per,85
NA,cent. That is an extraordinary difference in,85
NA,changes in fees over a relatively short period,85
NA,"of five years. Similarly, the fees charged for",85
NA,assisted reproductive technology services fell,85
NA,by nine per cent for in-hospital services and,85
NA,rose by 62 per cent for out-of-hospital ser-,85
NA,vices. This indicates that some doctors have,85
NA,been taking advantage of the safety net as,85
NA,their fees for out-of-hospital services have,85
NA,increased far in excess of the fees that they,85
NA,are charging in hospitals.,85
NA,"The report also showed that, while EMSN",85
NA,payments have provided many with financial,85
NA,relief from significant out-of-pocket medical,85
NA,"costs, those in the greatest financial need",85
NA,may be missing out on the benefits. The re-,85
NA,"view found that, for every EMSN benefit",85
NA,"dollar that is paid to a patient, 78 per cent",85
NA,went towards meeting the doctor's higher,85
NA,fees rather than reducing the patient's out-of-,85
NA,"pocket costs. Further, those who have bene-",85
NA,fited most from affordable services have,85
NA,tended to be in the wealthier areas as they are,85
NA,in a better position to access the more expen-,85
NA,sive specialist services in the first place.,85
NA,One would expect that costs would rise,85
NA,"over four years, but rises have been extraor-",85
NA,dinary in some areas and quite modest in,85
NA,"others. There is also, as I said, the substantial",85
NA,difference between in-hospital and out-of-,85
NA,"hospital fees, with extreme variations in fees",85
NA,charged by specialists for the same services.,85
NA,The purpose of this amendment is to ensure,85
NA,that taxpayers' money goes to reduce the out-,85
NA,of-pocket expenses for the benefit of patients,85
NA,and not to inflate the fees of some specialists,85
NA,in some circumstances. The consequences of,85
NA,fee rises are felt not just by those accessing,85
NA,the extended Medicare safety net but also by,85
NA,people who have not qualified for the safety,85
NA,net and also face those higher costs. This,85
NA,amendment allows the Minister for Health,85
NA,and Ageing to determine the maximum bene-,85
NA,fit that would be paid under the safety net,85
NA,through a legislative instrument to allow for,85
NA,parliamentary scrutiny. The report identified,85
NA,six areas of particular concern where fees,85
NA,have risen in an irregular way and well,85
NA,above others. Those six specific areas are,85
NA,"obstetrics; assisted reproductive technology,",85
NA,including IVF; some cataract operations;,85
NA,some hair transplants; varicose vein treat-,85
NA,ment; and several procedures involving the,85
NA,injection of a therapeutic substance into an,85
NA,eye. These areas have more than doubled,85
NA,"since the safety net was introduced and, dis-",85
NA,"turbingly, this increase is directly accounted",85
NA,for by increases in the fees charged by spe-,85
NA,cialists.,85
NA,"In cases such as these, particularly when",85
NA,50 per cent of the costs associated with this,85
NA,extended Medicare safety net program go to,85
NA,"areas such as reproductive health, there was",85
NA,always considerable controversy with any,85
NA,change that was made. We have already,85
NA,heard from the members of the opposition,85
NA,today stories of great pain and grief and joy,85
NA,of people undergoing IVF treatment in recent,85
NA,years under the current laws. We have al-,85
NA,ready heard some of those. We have heard,85
NA,stories of hospitals in regional areas whose,85
NA,departments have shut down or had their,85
NA,"funds cut back. That particular issue, of",85
NA,"course, is not related to this particular bill,",86
NA,but I would like to cover two particular ar-,86
NA,eas-the cataract area and assisted reproduc-,86
NA,tive technology-because I know that they,86
NA,are areas where it is very easy to frighten,86
NA,people who are already very fearful about,86
NA,what the future might hold for them.,86
NA,"When it comes to cataracts, the changes",86
NA,announced in the budget represent the first,86
NA,time in 13 years that a government has re-,86
NA,viewed the payment for cataract surgery.,86
NA,Over the past 13 years there has been signifi-,86
NA,cant advancement in the technology used to,86
NA,"carry out cataract operations, which means",86
NA,"that operations can now be performed faster,",86
NA,with better results and with greater safety for changes.,86
NA,patients. The changes made by the govern-,86
NA,ment more accurately reflect the time taken,86
NA,"to carry out these procedures, which typi-",86
NA,"cally, these days, is around 20 minutes. For",86
NA,this 20 minutes of work the new standard,86
NA,Medicare Benefits Schedule fee will be,86
NA,"$419.85. To put this into context, currently",86
NA,the cataract procedure takes around 20 min-,86
NA,utes and has the same fee as the payment,86
NA,made by government for complex skull sur-,86
NA,"gery, which takes more time to perform and",86
NA,carries a far greater risk for the patient.,86
NA,Ninety-five per cent of cataract procedures,86
NA,are undertaken in hospital.,86
NA,Assisted reproductive technology is also,86
NA,an area where it is very easy to frighten,86
NA,ple who are already afraid that circumstances,86
NA,for them will be worse than they are now.,86
NA,For the vast majority of people undergoing,86
NA,"IVF, this will not be the case. On average,",86
NA,"patients are charged around $6,000 per IVF",86
NA,"cycle, yet some doctors are charging in ex-",86
NA,"cess of $10,000 per cycle. Patients who see",86
NA,the specialists who charge around that,86
NA,"$6,000 or less will not be worse off under",86
NA,these changes. From 1 January the Medicare,86
NA,items for ART services will also be restruc-,86
NA,tured to better align the items to the phases,86
NA,of treatment involved in the ART cycle. This,86
NA,will help to spread the costs and caps across,86
NA,the treatment cycle to better reflect the costs,86
NA,involved at each stage of the treatment cycle.,86
NA,At the same time the government is also,86
NA,investing $157.6 million in increasing the,86
NA,"Medicare rebates for obstetric services, and",86
NA,$120.5 million in maternity services to im-,86
NA,prove options for women and support those,86
NA,doctors that do not charge high fees. Those,86
NA,changes have been particularly welcome in,86
NA,my electorate. I have met recently with a,86
NA,number of mums who are planning pregnan-,86
NA,cies in the next few years and are extremely,86
NA,pleased at the greater range of services that,86
NA,will become available because of those,86
NA,The government remains committed to the,86
NA,extended Medicare safety net. It is a very,86
NA,important part of health services in this coun-,86
NA,try and incredibly important for people fac-,86
NA,ing quite difficult times in their lives. In,86
NA,"2008, though, expenditure on the safety net",86
NA,"was $414 million, 30 per cent more than it",86
NA,was in 2007. Unless we make these changes,86
NA,now and support people in meeting their rea-,86
NA,"sonable out-of-pocket costs, this expenditure",86
NA,will continue to grow rapidly. As a govern-,86
NA,"ment, we cannot continue to see costs rise",86
NA,because of the rise in excessive fees at the,86
NA,upper end of a few small sections of our,86
NA,medical services. This bill creates a mecha-,86
NA,peo- nism by which the government can responsi-,86
NA,"bly manage the safety net, and it is extremely",86
NA,important for supporting the sustainability of,86
NA,the safety net so that singles and families can,86
NA,continue to receive this incredibly important,86
NA,assistance with their out-of-pocket costs.,86
Ms ROXON ,Gellibrand-Minister for,86
NA,Health and Ageing) (4.57 pm)-in reply-In,86
NA,summing up I would like to thank members,86
NA,for their contributions to the debate on this,86
NA,bill. It gives me great pleasure to follow the,86
NA,"member for Parramatta, who canvassed so",86
NA,many health issues for her electorate. This is,86
NA,"important to many people in the community,",87
NA,so I appreciate that people have taken the,87
NA,time to speak in the debate.,87
NA,The Health Insurance Amendment (Ex-,87
NA,tended Medicare Safety Net) Bill amends the,87
NA,Health Insurance Act 1973 to enable the,87
NA,Minister for Health and Ageing to determine,87
NA,by legislative instrument the maximum bene-,87
NA,fit payable under the extended Medicare,87
NA,safety net for each Medicare Benefits Sched-,87
NA,"ule item. These changes, made by the gov-",87
NA,"ernment in the budget, ensure that all items",87
NA,currently covered by the safety net remain,87
NA,covered by the safety net and no items will,87
NA,"be means tested for eligibility. Importantly,",87
NA,"IVF services will remain covered, with no",87
NA,age limits and no limitations on the number,87
NA,of cycles.,87
NA,"Members, including the member for",87
NA,"Cook, who have very personal stories and",87
NA,genuine concern about these changes should,87
NA,be assured that all IVF procedures that are,87
NA,currently covered will continue to be cov-,87
NA,"ered. There is still, I think, some remaining",87
NA,"concern in the community, some confusion,",87
NA,about the speculation compared to the reality,87
NA,"that all items will continue to be covered,",87
NA,"with no age limits, no limitation on the num-",87
NA,ber of cycles and no means-testing. The,87
NA,"changes, of course, go to a cap on the",87
NA,amount that can be charged-and I will,87
NA,come to that later-but I think that they,87
NA,"should address the concerns, genuine as they",87
NA,"are, from people like the member for Cook.",87
NA,"Cancer services, as well, will not be affected",87
NA,at all by these changes. The changes that we,87
NA,have made are to restrict taxpayer funds be-,87
NA,ing spent on excessive fees that have been,87
NA,charged by some specialists. We are protect-,87
NA,"ing the taxpayers, we are protecting the pa-",87
NA,"tients, and we are protecting those doctors",87
NA,who are doing the right thing in charging,87
NA,moderate fees.,87
NA,A recent independent review of the ex-,87
NA,"tended Medicare safety net, a report tabled",87
NA,"before this debate began, clearly showed that",87
NA,"in certain areas, such as obstetrics and IVF,",87
NA,the safety net had been used by specialist,87
NA,doctors to raise their fees knowing that the,87
NA,taxpayer would be called on to cover 80 per,87
NA,"cent of the cost of the fee rise. For example,",87
NA,"according to this report, between 2003 and",87
NA,2008 the fees charged by obstetricians for in-,87
NA,hospital services reduced by six per cent,87
NA,while the fees charged for out-of-hospital,87
NA,services increased by a staggering 267 per,87
NA,cent. The report also showed that the safety,87
NA,net is not making some medical services,87
NA,"more affordable for some patients-which,",87
NA,"of course, was the purpose for which it was",87
NA,originally intended.,87
NA,One of the reasons for this is that the,87
NA,amount of benefit available through the ex-,87
NA,"tended Medicare safety net is unlimited, and",87
NA,some specialists have taken advantage of this,87
NA,arrangement to increase their fees and their,87
NA,"incomes, unfortunately with no particular",87
NA,benefit to the patient. The current nature of,87
NA,the safety net means that doctors feel little,87
NA,pressure to moderate their fees. Due to these,87
NA,fee rises for some services some patient out-,87
NA,of-pocket expenses have even increased as a,87
NA,result of the extended Medicare safety net.,87
NA,Unless we act now we will not be able to,87
NA,stop this increasingly silly situation and the,87
NA,extended Medicare safety net will become,87
NA,unsustainable.,87
NA,"In 2008, expenditure on the extended",87
NA,"Medicare safety net was $414 million, 30 per",87
NA,cent more than the previous year. In some,87
NA,areas the increase is being driven by in-,87
NA,creased fees rather than the provision of,87
NA,more services. This bill creates a mechanism,87
NA,for the government to responsibly manage,87
NA,expenditure on the extended Medicare safety,87
NA,net. As part of the 2009-10 budget the gov-,87
NA,ernment is capping the benefits for some,87
NA,services where there is evidence of large in-,87
NA,"creases in the fees charged, services where",88
NA,the majority of the extended Medicare safety,88
NA,net benefit is going to doctors rather than to,88
NA,helping patients. The new caps will apply for,88
NA,"the following services: obstetrics, assisted",88
NA,"reproductive technology, hair transplantation,",88
NA,the injection of a therapeutic substance into,88
NA,"an eye, one type of cataract operation and",88
NA,one type of varicose vein treatment.,88
NA,Some members in the debate have ex-,88
NA,pressed the concern that this measure will,88
NA,increase the cost of obstetric services but I,88
NA,note that as part of this measure the govern-,88
NA,ment will also be investing $156.7 million to,88
NA,increase the Medicare rebates for private,88
NA,obstetric services. This means that the,88
NA,changes will allow all mothers who have,88
NA,their babies delivered by a private doctor to,88
NA,receive a standard Medicare rebate that is 30,88
NA,per cent higher than the current rebate. The,88
NA,government is also investing $120.5 million,88
NA,in a maternity services package. Part of this,88
NA,package will introduce Medicare items for,88
NA,midwifery services and will support greater,88
NA,choice for women-one of the issues,88
NA,touched upon by the member for Parramatta.,88
NA,The cost of IVF should not increase for,88
NA,"most patients. On average, patients are",88
NA,"charged around $6,000 per IVF cycle, yet",88
NA,there are some doctors charging in excess of,88
NA,"$10,000 per cycle. Patients who see special-",88
NA,"ists who charge $6,000 or less for a typical",88
NA,IVF cycle will not be worse off under these,88
NA,changes. In relation to the cap on the cataract,88
NA,"item, I think that the opposition health",88
NA,spokesperson is confused. The extended,88
NA,Medicare safety net only applies to out-of-,88
NA,"hospital services. There is, of course, a",88
NA,"rate measure which affects cataracts, to",88
NA,which he may have been referring. While I,88
NA,acknowledge that there is a crossover for a,88
NA,"small number of services, 95 per cent of pri-",88
NA,vate cataract procedures take place as in-,88
NA,patient services so the extended Medicare,88
NA,safety net does not apply.,88
NA,"I note, also, the closing comments of the",88
NA,"opposition spokesperson for health, who of-",88
NA,fered to work with the government to iden-,88
NA,tify alternative savings. That was a very kind,88
NA,"offer in this debate, but we have not had one",88
NA,suggestion from the opposition for any sav-,88
NA,"ings in any health related measure, let alone",88
NA,any measure relating to this bill or in this,88
NA,"budget debate. We have had no suggestions,",88
NA,"no policy proposals-nothing. In fact, all we",88
NA,have had so far is opposition to any of the,88
NA,measures that we have proposed in Health.,88
NA,So I do ask where those suggestions are. I,88
NA,would be happy to see them and consider,88
NA,them but they have not been forthcoming to,88
NA,date and I am not intending to hold my,88
NA,breath while I wait for them. I did wonder if,88
NA,the opposition spokesperson was suggesting,88
NA,that the opposition would now be opposing,88
NA,"this bill. Of course, the shadow Treasurer",88
NA,"clearly stated, following the budget:",88
NA,We're not going to block any initiatives other,88
NA,than the private health insurance initiative. So,88
NA,that's our position. We're not changing from it.,88
NA,So I wonder whether the member for Dick-,88
NA,son and the member for North Sydney are,88
NA,"not in agreement here, because it seems that",88
NA,the shadow minister is raising some sort of,88
NA,issue that might be walking away from the,88
NA,commitment made by the member for North,88
NA,Sydney.,88
NA,The important point here is that the ex-,88
NA,tended Medicare safety net is a patient bene-,88
NA,fit. It is not intended to be a mechanism by,88
NA,which doctors can simply increase their in-,88

NA,strict taxpayer funds from being spent on,88

NA,some specialists while protecting those very,88
NA,many doctors who are doing the right thing.,88
NA,"Importantly, it will continue to protect pa-",88

NA,taxpayers.,88
NA,The changes in this bill are necessary to,89
NA,assist us in keeping the safety net sustainable,89
NA,and available to all Australians into the fu-,89
NA,ture. These changes will allow Australian,89
NA,families to continue to have access to the,89
NA,safety net for IVF services into the future,89
NA,and they will allow access to the safety net,89
NA,"by families of cancer patients, who have very",89
NA,high costs that need to be covered in difficult,89
NA,"circumstances, and by many other worthy",89
NA,"recipients, without this money being unfairly",89
NA,skimmed off by that small number of doctors,89
NA,who are charging excessive fees. The gov-,89

Dr SOUTHCOTT ,Boothby) (5.06,89
NA,pm)-I am pleased to speak on the Social,89
NA,Security Amendment (Training Incentives),89
NA,Bill 2009 and indicate that the opposition,89
NA,will not be opposing this legislation. It is,89
NA,worth looking back 18 months because the,89
NA,government have now been in place for a,89
NA,little bit more than 18 months and it is time,89
NA,to deliver a mid-term report card on them.,89
NA,When you look specifically at the area of,89
NA,"youth unemployment, you see in only 18",89
NA,months a terrible performance in jobs for,89
NA,"teenagers, young Australians. Looking back",89
NA,"to November 2007, specifically at 15to 19-",89
NA,"year-old Australians, there were 257,000 in",89
NA,"full-time jobs, compared with 222,400 now.",89
NA,"There are almost 35,000 fewer teenagers in",89
NA,full-time jobs now than when the Rudd gov-,89
NA,"ernment was first elected. There are 31,000",89
NA,fewer teenagers in jobs in total. There are,89
NA,"now an extra 4,300 teenagers who are unem-",89
NA,ployed. We have also seen very large falls in,89
NA,"the participation rate for teenagers, from 60.4",89
NA,per cent to 57.4 per cent and in the employ-,89
NA,"ment rate for teenagers-that is, the em-",89
NA,ployment-to-population ratio-from 51 per,89
NA,cent to 47.8 per cent. That is a big change in,89
NA,just 18 months.,89
NA,"The lesson of previous recessions, of the",89
NA,"early 1980s and early 1990s, is that people",89
NA,who are just entering the labour force for the,89
NA,first time are often hit much harder. Youth,89
NA,unemployment in Australia generally rises at,89
NA,twice the rate of total unemployment. When,89
NA,"we look at 15to 24-year-olds, we see almost",89
NA,"70,000 fewer full-time jobs and 32,500 more",89
NA,unemployed. The unemployment rate for,89
NA,those looking for full-time work is up from,89
NA,9.8 per cent to 12.4 per cent. The overall un-,89
NA,employment rate is up from 9.7 per cent to,89
NA,11.4 per cent. This is in just 18 months. The,89
NA,participation rate for these young Australians,89
NA,has fallen from 71.2 per cent to 69.4 per,89
NA,"cent, and the employment rate, or employ-",89
NA,"ment-to-population ratio, has fallen almost",89
NA,"three per cent, from 64.1 per cent to 61.2 per",89
NA,cent.,89
NA,When you look at the labour force as a,89
NA,"whole, over the last 12 months the economy",89
NA,"has lost about 60,000 full-time jobs and there",89
NA,"have been about 100,000 part-time jobs cre-",89
NA,ated. When you look at the losses that have,89
NA,"occurred in the 15to 24-year-old age group,",89
NA,"there have been 70,000 full-time jobs lost in",89
NA,"the Australian economy, and that is equiva-",89
NA,lent to the entire loss of full-time jobs in the,89
NA,Australian economy over the last 12 months.,90
NA,So this group is definitely bearing the brunt,90
NA,"of the global financial crisis, but the Rudd",90
NA,government has introduced some specific,90
NA,policies that will disproportionately affect,90
NA,young Australians and their opportunities to,90
NA,get a start and to get a job.,90
NA,The bungled Job Services Australia will,90
NA,see massive disruption in the area of em-,90
NA,"ployment services, such that 47 per cent of",90
NA,job seekers will be changing their provider,90
NA,"and changing their case worker on 1 July, at",90
NA,a time when unemployment is rising. We,90
NA,"have heard from industry groups, from Res-",90
NA,"taurant and Catering, from pharmacies and",90
NA,from newsagents that the award modernisa-,90
NA,tion process will again lead to the loss of,90
NA,"jobs, and, typically, a lot of these jobs",90
NA,entry-level jobs for young people. We have,90
NA,heard from a variety of groups that the gov-,90
NA,ernment's Fair Work Bill will again be job,90
NA,destroying. These are three specific decisions,90
NA,that the government have taken. It is no,90
NA,wonder they are having to pump out billions,90
NA,and billions of dollars without having any,90
NA,idea of how many jobs will be created or,90
NA,supported when they have made specific de-,90
NA,cisions which go to the heart of the opportu-,90
NA,nities that there will be in the labour market.,90
NA,There are two parts to this bill. The first,90
NA,part is for a temporary training supplement,90
NA,of $41.60 per fortnight to eligible job seekers,90
NA,on Newstart or parenting payment who un-,90
NA,dertake approved training. These will be job,90
NA,seekers who do not have a year 12 or equiva-,90
NA,"lent level qualification, or who have a trade",90
NA,or vocational qualification that can be up-,90
NA,graded to help them find work. The payment,90
NA,will be available from 1 July 2009 to 30 June,90
NA,2011.,90
NA,The opposition are not opposed to train-,90
NA,"ing, but we believe that training is only one",90
NA,limb or one element of getting someone into,90
NA,a job. One of the weaknesses of the govern-,90
NA,ment's approach has been a complete failure,90
NA,to create a climate of strong job creation.,90
NA,Labor have failed to define a clear pathway,90
NA,between training and a job. There is a train-,90
NA,ing mantra but not a jobs mantra. It is critical,90
NA,that unemployment is addressed by boosting,90
NA,business confidence and encouraging em-,90
NA,ployers to take on new employees. The train-,90
NA,ing supplement is something we do not op-,90
NA,"pose, but, again, we believe that it is critical",90
NA,to demonstrate how this will lead into em-,90
NA,ployment.,90
NA,The second part of the bill relates to,90
NA,amending the participation requirements for,90
NA,"certain young people, requiring them to ei-",90
NA,ther earn or learn to be eligible for youth,90
NA,allowance. The opposition supports this ap-,90
NA,will be proach. Over the last 12 months we have,90
NA,seen the number of teenagers who are not in,90
NA,full-time education or full-time employment,90
NA,"increase from fewer than 200,000-about",90
NA,"195,000-to 242,000. What we know is that",90
NA,people who are not in full-time education,90
NA,and not in full-time employment traditionally,90
NA,will languish and have trouble remaining in,90
NA,the labour force over their lifetimes. As I said,90
NA,"earlier, during past economic downturns",90
NA,youth unemployment has increased dispro-,90
NA,portionately. It is critical that we ensure that,90
NA,young people do not become disengaged and,90
NA,disenfranchised. One of the concerns about,90
NA,the labour force statistics is that we are see-,90
NA,ing very large falls in the participation rates,90
NA,of young Australians. We have seen in a pe-,90
NA,riod of 18 months very dramatic falls in the,90
NA,participation rates of young Australians. It is,90
NA,critical that we do keep people engaged in,90
NA,the labour market and we do keep people,90
NA,actively looking for work.,90
NA,"As I said, the opposition does support the",90
NA,"tightening-up of youth allowance. But, again,",90
NA,it is only one aspect of improving youth un-,90
NA,employment and providing more opportuni-,90
NA,ties for younger Australians. There are lots of,90
NA,aspects that need to be addressed so that em-,90
NA,ployers will take on extra workers so there,91
NA,will be the jobs there for younger Austra-,91
NA,"lians. As I said at the start, what we have",91
NA,seen is disappearing jobs for younger Austra-,91
NA,lians-full-time jobs and overall jobs-and,91
NA,big falls in the participation rate and the,91
NA,"ployment rate. So, whilst training and educa-",91
NA,"tion can certainly boost employability, train-",91
NA,ing is not for everyone and not everyone,91
NA,gains a benefit from training. The experience,91
NA,around the world is that training programs,91
NA,can be very expensive and actually have,91
NA,quite poor employment outcomes. We be-,91
NA,lieve it is important to tailor approaches to,91
NA,the individual.,91
NA,The opposition will be looking very care-,91
NA,"fully at the labour force figures,",91
NA,‘learn or earn' is not a cynical attempt to dis-,91
NA,tort and manipulate the unemployment fig-,91
NA,ures as people who would otherwise be look-,91
NA,ing for work are pushed into training in order,91
NA,to claim income support payments. We do,91
NA,not want to see a return to the training,91
NA,treadmill and many of the training programs,91
NA,"of Working Nation, which actually had very",91
NA,poor employment outcomes and very low,91
NA,chances of people going from those pro-,91
NA,grams into a job. We will be watching the,91
NA,figures on youth unemployment very care-,91
NA,fully. We think that this is a critical area to,91
NA,address for the future because it is very im-,91
NA,"portant that people do remain engaged, do",91
NA,"remain active, so that they have a much",91
NA,stronger connection with the labour force,91
NA,over their lives.,91
Ms HALL ,Shortland) (5.18 pm)-I rise,91
NA,to very strongly support the Social Security,91
NA,Amendment (Training Incentives) Bill 2009,91
NA,before us today. As a person who in a past,91
NA,life worked with young people who were,91
NA,"looking for work, and as a person who has",91
NA,had a lot to do with the actual training as-,91
NA,"pects of young people and workers generally,",91
NA,I feel that this ‘learn or earn' legislation is,91
NA,very important. At the commencement of my,91
NA,contribution to this debate I would like to,91
NA,very strongly emphasise that to let young,91
NA,"people who are unemployed languish, with-",91
NA,"out any assistance from government, is des-",91
NA,picable. What this legislation will do when it,91
NA,em- is enacted is see that that does not happen.,91
NA,What I also think is despicable is for,91
NA,"young people with poor skills, poor literacy",91
NA,and poor numeracy to be penalised and to be,91
NA,thrown on the backburner and totally disre-,91
NA,garded-put into a Work for the Dole pro-,91
NA,"gram, if there is one available, but at no time",91
NA,really having the issues that go to that per-,91
NA,son's employability addressed. I think this,91
NA,legislation actually looks at some of those,91
NA,issues and will provide hope and a start for,91
NA,ensuring that young people.,91
NA,In the past few years we have had a gov-,91
NA,ernment-not the Rudd government but the,91
NA,previous government-that really squan-,91
NA,dered opportunities and did not train those,91
NA,people for the jobs that were available. We,91
NA,had a chronic skills shortage here in Austra-,91
NA,"lia at a time when our economy was thriving,",91
NA,when there was this great need for people to,91
NA,fill the jobs that were vacant. It would have,91
NA,been an excellent opportunity for the then,91
NA,government to embrace legislation like that,91
NA,"we are debating here tonight, legislation that",91
NA,would have ensured that young people were,91
NA,prepared for work and that they were moving,91
NA,forward and being placed in a situation,91
NA,where they could make a tangible contribu-,91
NA,"tion to our economy, where they had the",91
NA,skills that they needed to enter the workforce,91
NA,and where they could undertake ongoing,91
NA,training.,91
NA,This bill will amend the Social Security,91
NA,Act 1991 to provide for training supplements,91
NA,for eligible recipients of parenting payment,91
NA,and Newstart allowance who have not com-,91
NA,pleted year 12 or equivalent or who seek to,91
NA,upgrade their vocational qualifications and,91
NA,who commence approved training or further,91
NA,education between 1 July 2009 and 30 June,92
NA,"2011. So, here you see the target group:",92
NA,young people who have not completed year,92
NA,12 or equivalent and who really do not have,92
NA,the education or the skills that they need to,92
NA,enter the workforce.,92
NA,On my way into the chamber I believe I,92
NA,heard the shadow minister for employment,92
NA,participation saying that unemployment has,92
NA,"risen. Yes, it has risen, and we acknowledge",92
NA,that on this side of the chamber. We also ac-,92
NA,knowledge that the global financial crisis is,92
NA,having an enormous impact on employment,92
NA,but not as big an impact in Australia as it is,92
NA,having elsewhere. We see this as an opportu-,92
NA,nity to provide that training for young peo-,92
NA,ple.,92
NA,The legislation also amends the participa-,92
NA,"tion requirement for youth allowance, where",92
NA,a person under 20 years of age has not com-,92
NA,pleted year 12 or an equivalent certificate,92
NA,level II to level IV qualification. A youth,92
NA,allowance will be payable to young people,92
NA,without year 12 or equivalent if they study,92
NA,full-time or if they comply with the Youth,92
NA,Allowance Employment Pathway Plan.,92
NA,I need to talk a little bit about the em-,92
NA,ployment pathway plan. It is absolutely im-,92
NA,perative that a young person with limited,92
NA,"training, maybe sometimes a less than per-",92
NA,fect education and very few skills determines,92
NA,a goal and works out how they are going to,92
NA,achieve that goal. In working towards that,92
NA,goal they will have a number of strategies. In,92
NA,those strategies they will list the steps that,92
NA,need to be taken for them to gain the qualifi-,92
NA,"cation and gain a job at the end. For instance,",92
NA,an early school leaver may feel that they,92
NA,would make an excellent horticulturalist-,92
NA,"they like being outdoors, they like gardening",92
NA,and they do not mind hard work-but they,92
NA,are unaware of what they need to do to ob-,92
NA,tain a position working in horticulture. For,92
NA,that person an employment pathway plan,92
NA,needs to be developed whereby they will be,92
NA,able to undertake the certificate-level courses,92
NA,that meet the requirements of the job. They,92
NA,will follow it up with some work experience,92
NA,and on-the-job training as well as some for-,92
NA,mal off-the-job training. The pathway plan,92
NA,will require at least 25 hours a week in a,92
NA,combination of part-time study or training,92
NA,"and other approved activities, which could be",92
NA,"on-the-job training, which I think is impor-",92
NA,tant because it is all part of helping the,92
NA,young person to develop the skills that they,92
NA,need to enter the workforce.,92
NA,Some exemptions will apply. We know,92
NA,that training may be reasonably available for,92
NA,a person but the person may not have the,92
NA,capacity to undertake the available training.,92
NA,That could occur in a situation where the,92
NA,"young person lives in quite a remote area,",92
NA,where there is only training at a much higher,92
NA,level than the person has the basic skills to,92
NA,undertake or where the person has a disabil-,92
NA,ity and needs to undertake a specialised form,92
NA,of training.,92
NA,The training supplement has a financial,92
NA,impact of $83.1 million in additional spend-,92
NA,"ing over four years, so you can see that the",92
NA,government is making a significant contribu-,92
NA,tion to the training of young Australians. The,92
NA,government is prepared to invest at this par-,92
NA,ticular time in Australia's future. That is what,92
NA,this is; it is investing in training young peo-,92
NA,ple for Australia's future so that when things,92
NA,improve globally and within the Australian,92
NA,economy-when more jobs become avail-,92
NA,able-we will have young people with the,92
NA,skills who can walk into those jobs. We will,92
NA,be competitive not only within Australia but,92
NA,globally.,92
NA,The measure also amends the participation,92
NA,requirements for 15to 20-year-olds and has,92
NA,a net financial cost of $14.4 million over four,92
NA,years. The training supplement is an addi-,92
NA,tional time-limited payment of $41.60 per,92
NA,fortnight. That training allowance is an in-,93
NA,centive to young people to undertake the,93
NA,training. The budget announcement for this,93
NA,measure stated that changes to the participa-,93
NA,tion requirement for Youth Allowance will,93
NA,come into effect on 1 July this year and for,93
NA,new claimants without year 12 or equivalent,93
NA,from 1 January 2010. The budget announce-,93
NA,ments also state that the training supplements,93
NA,will commence from 1 July this year. So it is,93
NA,very important that this legislation gets,93
NA,through the parliament in this sitting. It is,93
NA,very important that we are prepared to pro-,93
NA,vide the training that these young people,93
NA,need.,93
NA,The bill will also assist low-skilled job,93
NA,seekers with the costs of participation in,93
NA,training or further education which may as-,93
NA,sist them to obtain employment in the future.,93
NA,Job seekers will need to participate in ap-,93
NA,proved education or training to receive the,93
NA,training supplements. Some people might,93
NA,study full-time; some might study part-time.,93
NA,Partial capacity to work will come into play.,93
NA,People doing courses that go for longer than,93
NA,a 12-month period may be eligible for stu-,93
NA,dent income support payments.,93
NA,The fact that this legislation is targeting,93
NA,low-skilled workers is very important for us,93
NA,here in the parliament to consider. We need,93
NA,to upskill our workforce. As I mentioned at,93
NA,the commencement of my contribution to,93
NA,"this debate, one of the big mistakes that the",93
NA,previous government made was failing to,93
NA,skill our workforce and failing to train peo-,93
NA,ple for the jobs that were available in Austratoring,93
NA,lia. It was such a missed opportunity. At that,93
NA,"particular time, we had job vacancies and a",93
NA,very significant youth unemployment rate.,93
NA,What we are doing is addressing the needs of,93
NA,young people and the needs of Australia.,93
NA,The bill will also encourage more young,93
NA,people to gain the education and skills that,93
NA,they need to move into further education. It,93
NA,is not only employment that is important.,93
NA,Success at a lower level course gives young,93
NA,people the confidence to move on to courses,93
NA,that will set them up for a career for their rest,93
NA,of their lives. That career could start with an,93
NA,apprenticeship or otherwise; the employment,93
NA,could be in any job that young people find,93
NA,that they are interested in.,93
NA,Some young job seekers who participate,93
NA,"in the Productivity Places Program, which is",93
NA,"another aspect of this legislation, will not",93
NA,"have to pay for their courses. However, not",93
NA,all courses taken up through the PPP will fit,93
NA,into that category. This is recognition that,93
NA,some people need more help. There is not a,93
NA,member in this House who would deny the,93
NA,fact that there are definitely a lot of young,93
NA,"people out there who, through no fault of",93
NA,"their own, find themselves in quite disadvan-",93
NA,taged situations. The PPP will work well,93
NA,with that particular group of young people.,93
NA,"Once again, this legislation is looking after",93
NA,particularly disadvantaged young people.,93
NA,This legislation has been quite well re-,93
NA,ceived. I note that ACOSS are a little cau-,93
NA,tious but cautiously supportive of the pro-,93
NA,posal. They state that they will be looking,93
NA,closely at the youth allowance conditions so,93
NA,that disadvantaged young Australians are not,93
NA,"unfairly penalised, which is what happened",93
NA,under the previous administration. These,93
NA,young Australians were unfairly penalised,93
NA,but not given the training that they needed.,93
NA,ACOSS also said that they acknowledge that,93
NA,there is a need for ongoing training and men-,93
NA,that suits the circumstances of young,93
NA,people.,93
NA,The National Union of Students said:,93
NA,It is good to see that the government is expanding,93
NA,the number of tertiary and training places. A re-,93
NA,newed government focus on education will help,93
NA,generations through the recession.,93
NA,"That is exactly right. They also said, how-",93
NA,"ever, that the COAG policies must not be all",93
NA,stick and no carrot. That was a problem un-,94
NA,der the previous government. For anything to,94
NA,"be successful, you need to make sure that",94
NA,you have the mixture of carrot and stick,94
NA,right.,94
NA,There will be a significant number of,94
NA,places available as part of the youth compact,94
NA,with the state and territory governments.,94
NA,There is a commitment to immediate action,94
NA,to ensure significant school and training,94
NA,places are available for people aged 15 to 19,94
NA,who are entitled to an education or training,94
NA,place. This must be fully implemented by 1,94
NA,"July this year. Once again, this is a commit-",94
NA,ment by government to young people. It will,94
NA,ensure that they have a future. The govern-,94
NA,ment is prepared to get behind them and of-,94
NA,fer them the training and the skills that they,94
NA,need to enter the workforce. As I mentioned,94
NA,"previously, part of that plan includes on-the-",94
NA,job and off-the-job training. I see that as,94
NA,viding very broad and full training to young,94
NA,people.,94
NA,"In addition, young people aged 20 to 24",94
NA,will have an entitlement to education and,94
NA,training. This commitment will be imple-,94
NA,mented by 1 January 2010. State and terri-,94
NA,tory governments will work with their educa-,94
NA,tion authorities and training providers to,94
NA,make arrangements for determining eligibil-,94
NA,ity for an entitlement place. It is anticipated,94
NA,that most places will be provided by TAFEs,94
NA,and some registered private training organi-,94
NA,sations offering government subsidised,94
NA,"qualifications. The Commonwealth, states",94
NA,and territories will work together to ensure,94
NA,that those young people living in rural and,94
NA,remote areas will also get the access that,94
NA,they not only need but deserve.,94
NA,This legislation provides hope for a future,94
NA,for young people. Changes in this legislation,94
NA,support the youth compact and the national,94
NA,youth participation requirements agreed by,94
NA,COAG on 30 April 2009. This measure will,94
NA,also assist in bringing forward the COAG,94
NA,targets of 90 per cent year 12 or equivalent,94
NA,attainment rates for 2015 to 2020. The train-,94
NA,ing supplement will be available for two,94
NA,years to provide enhanced incentives for job,94
NA,seekers to gain skills and qualifications dur-,94
NA,ing the global recession. This legislation is,94
NA,about government acting. This is about the,94
NA,Rudd government recognising that young,94
NA,"people deserve a future, and it is investing in",94
NA,their future by giving them opportunities to,94
NA,undertake training so as to prepare them-,94
NA,selves for jobs as they become available.,94
Mr TUCKEY ,O'Connor) (5.37 pm)-In,94
NA,"her closing statement, the member for Short-",94
NA,land ran one of the recitation issues that this,94
NA,parliament is now confronted with in terms,94
NA,of ‘a government acting'. There is only way,94
NA,to describe the Social Security Amendment,94
NA,"(Training Incentives) Bill 2009, and that is ‘a",94
NA,progovernment reacting'. It is reacting to a very,94
NA,"significant fall in employment, particularly",94
NA,"amongst young people. It is, of course, the",94
NA,"outcome of recession, including-as the",94
NA,minister reminded us during her second read-,94
NA,ing speech-the recession that we had to,94
NA,"have in the 1990s, when it was again young",94
NA,people in particular who found employment,94
NA,very hard to obtain.,94
NA,Another factor that is making it difficult,94
NA,for young people to get employment is the,94
NA,simple fact that employers are preparing,94
NA,themselves for the introduction of the Fair,94
NA,Work Australia legislation on 1 July. We see,94
NA,daily reports in the media of efforts by the,94
NA,trade union movement to further extend its,94
NA,"power and, from its perspective, hopefully its",94
NA,revenues. This is to generate enough money,94
NA,to run another misleading campaign to try to,94
NA,convince the working people of Australia,94
NA,"that this government should remain in office,",94
NA,knowing full well that we are not part of the,94
NA,trade union appreciation society. We are not,94
NA,dependent upon its funding to win or lose,94
NA,elections. This has been highlighted by the,94
NA,"most recent unemployment statistics, which",95
NA,show a fall in the number of people in per-,95
NA,"manent employment from 25,000 to 20,000.",95
NA,The unemployment figures were compen-,95
NA,sated by a similar number in casual employ-,95
NA,"ment. And, of course, employment is going",95
NA,to go casual because that is the protective,95
NA,mechanism that small business employers,95
NA,will put into their arrangements to ensure,95
NA,that they do not get caught in the ‘go away',95
NA,money trap that was significant with the pre-,95
NA,vious unfair dismissal exercise. That legisla-,95
NA,tion just became unfair to employers who,95
NA,were silly enough to give people a full-time,95
NA,"job and who, for whatever reason, found",95
NA,later that they had to disconnect from those,95
NA,"people-and probably for very good reason,",95
NA,as was frequently raised with my office. For,95
NA,"example, one small business man put on two",95
NA,"workers and, at the end of 12 months, the",95
NA,business that he had anticipated had not ma-,95
NA,terialised. He very apologetically put off,95
NA,"these two people, paid them in excess of",95
NA,their entitlement and then received claims,95
NA,"from each of them for $10,000 for unfair",95
NA,dismissal. He rang his industrial adviser and,95
NA,"said, ‘I'll fight these rotten devils to the High",95
NA,"Court.' His adviser said, ‘And how much are",95
NA,"they asking for?' and he said, ‘$10,000 each.'",95
NA,His adviser said: ‘Pay them. You'll win your,95
NA,case but it'll cost you more than that to do,95
NA,so.' That is coming up. Small business learnt,95
NA,its lesson last time.,95
NA,The reverse applied when the Howard,95
NA,government discontinued unfair dismissal,95
NA,legislation for employers with fewer than,95
NA,"100 workers and, as a result, 50,000 jobs",95
NA,materialised in a month. In both New South,95
NA,Wales and Victoria-the typical rust bucket,95
NA,states that were not benefiting from the huge,95
NA,growth in resources exports-jobs material-,95
NA,ised not because they were necessarily new,95
NA,jobs but because people had the confidence,95
NA,to employ people on a full-time basis.,95
NA,"As history also tells us, there was a time",95
NA,when it was not unusual for young people to,95
NA,leave the workforce after year 10 and enter,95
NA,into on-the-job apprenticeships and other,95
NA,on-the-job training positions. In years gone,95
NA,"by, this did not even include TAFE training,",95
NA,which I think is a necessary part of today's,95
NA,"arrangements. But, again, we wonder why",95
NA,employers are not breaking their necks to,95
NA,take on apprentices and trainees in various,95
NA,categories when they are paid at a rate that,95
NA,does not equate to their productive effort,95
NA,"and, more particularly, sees them absent",95
NA,from their workplace one or two days a week,95
NA,for training. No compensation of conse-,95
NA,quence is paid to employers for having those,95
NA,people unavailable on those days.,95
NA,These situations have arisen. This legisla-,95
NA,tion proposes that the taxpayer picks up,95
NA,"some of that tab, and that may therefore be",95
NA,"advantageous, not for people in work but for",95
NA,people who are not in work. It is referred,95
NA,to-and I endorse this principle-as ‘learn or,95
NA,earn'. Whilst I do not disagree with a reason-,95
NA,"able safety net, it has unfortunately been",95
NA,found by a lot of young people to be suffi-,95
NA,"cient to get by on, and they then do not seri-",95
NA,ously seek employment. If I were to be given,95
NA,a couple of hours to speak on this issue in,95
NA,"this place, I could run through a list of ex-",95
NA,amples where I and members of my extended,95
NA,"family, as employers, have had unemployed",95
NA,persons turn up at our places of business for,95
NA,"the purpose of doing an interview and, in",95
NA,"their opening remarks, say: ‘We don't want",95
NA,"this job, you know. We're not going to take",95
NA,it. We'll really be a nuisance to you if you,95
NA,employ us.' They were there to get a signa-,95
NA,ture in their book to say that they had been,95
NA,out actively seeking work. This provision,95
NA,may do something in that regard and that of,95
NA,course will be a positive.,95
NA,I can see that it is a means of assisting. It,95
NA,is going to cost substantial amounts of,95
NA,money-$83.1 million is targeted to date-,95
NA,"and, in fact, job seekers meeting these re-",96
NA,quirements will receive an extra $41.60 per,96
NA,fortnight if they undertake an approved train-,96
NA,ing or further education course of less than,96
NA,"12 months duration at the certificate II, III",96
NA,IV level. But let me return to the issue as to,96
NA,why it now appears that by year 10 you have,96
NA,not absorbed enough education to take a job,96
NA,"in the trades or elsewhere, as was previously",96
NA,"the case. One can say, ‘Oh well, it's all com-",96
NA,puterised now.' That is a complexity. That,96
NA,seems to be one of the things that most kids,96
NA,know about and understand before they go to,96
NA,school. I was talking to someone the other,96
NA,day who had to ring their grandchild to help,96
NA,them sort out a software problem they were,96
NA,experiencing with their computer at home.,96
NA,That is wonderful and we read about this all,96
NA,over the place.,96
NA,I once learnt to fly a Chipmunk aeroplane,96
NA,and its only form of navigation was a marine,96
NA,compass. If I were to try to fly a current,96
NA,model of aeroplane today without high levels,96
NA,"of computer skills, I would not be able to get",96
NA,"it off the ground. Unfortunately, we recently",96
NA,read of a disaster where computers were,96
NA,suddenly interrupted and how difficult it was,96
NA,for a professional pilot to fly a commercial,96
NA,aircraft. A farmer in my electorate of,96
NA,O'Connor is now employing equipment,96
NA,which literally drives itself very accurately.,96
NA,So there is a need for that form of training.,96
NA,"On the other hand, as reported in the media",96
NA,"recently, three young mothers turned up at a",96
NA,"picture theatre and, for reasons not stated,",96
NA,could not work out how much was three,96
NA,times the entry fee of $9. That is not an in-,96
NA,dictment of those people but an indictment of,96
NA,an education system that has probably turned,96
NA,them out in year 10 with the inability to say,96
NA,"that three nines are 27. Why is that? Because,",96
NA,"quite foolishly, we walked away from the",96
NA,education structures that made sure every-,96
NA,body knew those basic forms of multiplica-,96
NA,tion.,96
NA,I ran hotels for about 25 to 30 years and I,96
NA,employed a vast number of staff on about,96
NA,one hour's assessment. The first thing I,96
NA,looked at was whether they walked fast or,96
NA,"or slowly, but each and every one of those peo-",96
NA,"ple, particularly the women, had the ability",96
NA,to add up. They could not go to the electronic,96
NA,machine that is now provided and is about,96
NA,the slowest way of dispensing alcohol I have,96
NA,ever seen in my life. I do not know how you,96
NA,can have an alcopops problem. They could,96
NA,add up and they did add up as they put the,96
NA,drinks order together and told the group to,96
NA,which they were supplying the drinks the,96
NA,price. How did they learn that? There were,96
NA,no computers to assist. The cash register was,96
NA,of the push-down variety on which you reg-,96
NA,istered the amount involved; you did not get,96
NA,a message from the register telling you what,96
NA,the change was. You had to work it out your-,96
NA,self. These were young and not-so-young,96
NA,men and women who could add up without,96
NA,"any difficulty. From my own recollection,",96
NA,when you walked into a school in the open-,96
NA,ing period you heard kids in every classroom,96
NA,reciting their times tables. They were actu-,96
NA,ally taught to read by phonetics. And where,96
NA,are we now? We are back to phonics. We,96
NA,have gone back to having that debate after,96
NA,the elite education establishment undermined,96
NA,all the practical outcomes that equipped a,96
NA,young person to enter employment after year,96
NA,10.,96
NA,"As I have said, there are certain technical",96
NA,aspects to this bill-I read the statistics in the,96
NA,second reading speech of the Minister for,96
NA,Education-but without an adequate basic,96
NA,education another year's training is not going,96
NA,"to do much and, if that year's training is",96
NA,needed to repair the incapacity of a young,96
NA,"person to read and write, should we be build-",96
NA,"ing new assembly halls or, better, should we",96
NA,be organising the teaching profession so that,96
NA,we can turn out young people with the basic,96
NA,three Rs education? I think that is a matter of,96
NA,grave concern. All the talk in this parliament,97
NA,about how much money is being spent on,97
NA,education and training is irrelevant unless it,97
NA,delivers outcomes. I smiled today when the,97
NA,minister was explaining that she was going,97
NA,to shift money from a school to which it had,97
NA,been allocated-the school was going to be,97
NA,knocked down-to a school where the other,97
NA,pupils were going to go. That amalgamated,97
NA,"school might be brand new, but it is still",97
NA,ing to get the money. I note on one occasion,97
NA,the government obviously woke up to that,97
NA,"fact and said, ‘Well, we had better not spend",97
NA,it on paint; we will spend it on computers.' I,97
NA,thought computers were coming free under,97
NA,another program. Are we just recycling,97
NA,money? Is it going to be free computers one,97
NA,day and a coat of paint the next day? As I,97
NA,"said in my speech on the appropriations, very",97
NA,few of about the 150 schools in my elector-,97
NA,"ate chose to take the $150,000 on offer. They",97
NA,did not take it because the opinion of the,97
NA,school principal and the parent associations,97
NA,was that they did not need that much. They,97
NA,are now being told to spend up to $3 million,97
NA,"or else, yet internally the system is still ad-",97
NA,vising us that young people who have not,97
NA,completed year 12 have an inadequate edu-,97
NA,cation base on which to obtain employment.,97
NA,"That was never the case, and it need not",97
NA,"be the case, notwithstanding that there are",97
NA,good reasons for most students to continue to,97
NA,year 12 provided they have a capacity to ab-,97
NA,sorb the education that that system provides.,97
NA,But what if it does not and a student's ten-,97
NA,dency is to be a highly skilled tradesperson?,97
NA,It is a great tragedy of history that some of,97
NA,the most highly skilled tradesmen I have met,97
NA,going back to my childhood have had very,97
NA,little education. But they were highly skilled,97
NA,"in their trade, and that has changed some-",97
NA,what because a trade is not so manual. What,97
NA,I am saying is this: these ideas cannot be,97
NA,"criticised and we hope they work, but they",97
NA,are an indictment of the existing education,97
NA,system because they should not be needed;,97
NA,the training should not be needed.,97
NA,There is another problem that arises from,97
NA,"that and, furthermore, I can quote examples.",97
NA,You have got to be very careful as an admin-,97
NA,istrator to see that training does not become,97
NA,an excuse for doing nothing. In recent years I,97
NA,"know of people who said, ‘I'm going back to",97
NA,"do another course,' and left full-time paid",97
NA,go- employment because a course was easier,97
NA,than turning up for seven hours a day in a,97
NA,job. So that is a problem. You get people,97
NA,"who are perennially doing courses, and the",97
NA,evidence of that exists for anyone who wants,97
NA,to check the stats or talk to people who have,97
NA,employed persons who have often come to,97
NA,them as unemployed. I think that is another,97
NA,worthwhile comment to make in this debate.,97
NA,"In the five minutes left available to me, I",97
NA,note that this legislation deals with some of,97
NA,the principles and entry requirements for,97
NA,youth allowance. On the last sitting Thursday,97
NA,"I presented to this parliament 6,280-as I",97
NA,think the number was-signatures on a peti-,97
NA,tion collected in fewer than 10 days from,97
NA,people protesting about the unfair changes to,97
NA,the Youth Allowance system. It pops up here,97
NA,in a most interesting way when the minister,97
NA,"says, to support these initiatives, the Com-",97
NA,monwealth government committed to mak-,97
NA,ing education and training a precondition,97
NA,"‘for young people without year 12, or the",97
NA,"equivalent, to obtain youth allowance (other)",97
NA,and family tax benefit part A'. The youth,97
NA,allowance took into account the fact that,97
NA,"young people, having passed year 12, were",97
NA,typically wishing to enter university and of-,97
NA,ten-as in the case of my electorate-were,97
NA,living an unacceptable travel distance from,97
NA,"the place of learning, which required their",97
NA,"relocation, and that the rent allowance com-",97
NA,ponent of youth allowance was extremely,97
NA,important to them. They could prove their,97
NA,independence by going to work where work,97
NA,was available.,97
NA,"The interesting thing about this is that,",98
NA,"while we talk about the new conditions,",98
NA,which have nothing to do with parental in-,98
NA,"come and all those sorts of things, they are",98
NA,still a roadblock to participation. Whilst the,98
NA,"minister, in her second reading speech, ad-",98
NA,mits that it is very difficult for any young,98
NA,"person to get a job at the moment, in the",98
NA,"same breath she says, ‘But if you can't find",98
NA,one for 30 hours a week then you can't qual-,98
NA,ify for youth allowance.' In rural areas that,98
NA,does not happen. What students did under the,98
NA,"old system was to take the seasonal work,",98
NA,"which is now the norm through rural areas,",98
NA,whereby they could work long hours for,98
NA,good rates of pay and accumulate a sum of,98
NA,"money-I think it reached about $19,000-",98
NA,and that was then their proven qualification,98
NA,to obtain youth allowance and take them-,98
NA,"selves off to university, where hopefully",98
NA,some of them might have even studied sci-,98
NA,ence and other scientific disciplines and went,98
NA,"back and taught young people. In fact, now",98
NA,we are funding the cost of laboratories and,98
NA,all of these newly equipped facilities in edu-,98
NA,cation establishments-and hooray for,98
NA,that-but there is nobody with the compe-,98
NA,tence to teach within the repaired or renewed,98
NA,or rebuilt facilities. You would not let most,98
NA,of them loose with a Bunsen burner. So how,98
NA,is that going to work?,98
NA,It is just another indictment of this legislastructure,98
NA,"tion. We do not oppose it. We wish it well,",98
NA,but it would not be occurring in this fashion,98
NA,"if, when young people came out of education",98
NA,"and were not seeking an academic career,",98
NA,they could have the necessary basic skills to,98
NA,be employed and in fact to grow into the,98
NA,highly qualified skills which traditionally,98
NA,they learned in the workplace-and learned,98
NA,"them extremely well, as those of us know",98
NA,who still have the opportunity to walk into,98
NA,older style houses and see how they were,98
NA,"built with a hammer, nails and handsaws and",98
NA,that sort of equipment no longer used to any,98
NA,great extent. (Time expired),98
NA,Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (5.58 pm)-I rise to,98
NA,speak in support of the Social Security,98
NA,Amendment (Training Incentives) Bill 2009.,98
NA,"Before I go to the key areas of the bill, I will",98
NA,comment on some of the notable statements,98
NA,"by the member for O'Connor. Firstly, I sin-",98
NA,cerely disagree with the member for,98
NA,O'Connor's statement that he would not let,98
NA,most teachers loose with Bunsen burners. I,98
NA,think that there are some fantastic teachers,98
NA,out there who should be commended for the,98
NA,work that they are doing. We need to make,98
NA,sure that we are supporting those teachers. I,98
NA,"am sure that, if the member for O'Connor",98
NA,looked beyond the Building the Education,98
NA,Revolution funding that is being provided by,98
NA,this government and actually looked at this,98
NA,government's overall policy in relation to our,98
NA,"education revolution, he and many of the",98
NA,members on the other side of the House,98
NA,would see that this government has commit-,98
NA,ted to an overall approach to improving edu-,98
NA,"cation in our schools, both public and pri-",98
NA,"vate, across this country and that that in-",98
NA,cludes working on a national curriculum and,98
NA,a whole range of initiatives. Certainly the,98
NA,schools in my area welcome the debate and,98
NA,discussion on these key areas as much as,98
NA,they welcome the investment in school infra-,98
NA,that they believe is also important.,98
NA,The member for O'Connor seems to be,98
NA,arguing that we should make sure that stu-,98
NA,dents are fully equipped for the workforce by,98
NA,grade 10. You would almost be led to be-,98
NA,"lieve, based on the comments just made by",98
NA,"the member for O'Connor, that we should",98
NA,get rid of grades 11 and 12 altogether be-,98
NA,cause everyone should be suitable for the,98
NA,workforce by grade 10.,98
NA,Mr Tuckey interjecting-,98
The DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr KJ,99
NA,Thomson)-Order! The member for,99
NA,O'Connor will cease interjecting.,99
NA,Mrs D'ATH-The member for O'Connor,99
NA,"can argue all he wants, but comments were",99
NA,made over and over again during that speech,99
NA,on this bill that we should make sure that,99
NA,students are fully equipped for the workforce,99
NA,by grade 10. That seems to be the bench-,99
NA,"mark, not grade 12. The problem is that",99
NA,"businesses want more than that nowadays,",99
NA,which the member for O'Connor and other,99
NA,members on the other side of the House,99
NA,would know if they actually went and talked,99
NA,to them. Businesses actually want students to,99
NA,have grade 12 or equivalent qualifications or,99
NA,they want those students to take on further,99
NA,education. It is not acceptable to merely have,99
NA,a grade 10 qualification.,99
NA,"The member for O'Connor may say,",99
NA,"‘Well, that's because the kids of today aren't",99
NA,taught phonics and aren't taught times ta-,99
NA,bles.' I disagree because my sevenand nine-,99
NA,year-olds are reciting the times tables that,99
NA,they are being taught in a state school and,99
NA,they are also learning to read and write,99
NA,through phonics. That sort of learning is cerin,99
NA,tainly still going on in our schools and we,99
NA,should commend our teachers for still teach-,99
NA,ing those important fundamental aspects of,99
NA,education. But we cannot ignore that com-,99
NA,puters are not just part of our schooling and,99
NA,our businesses but part of our way of life,99
NA,now. We also need to teach our young peo-,99
NA,ple in primary school and secondary school,99
NA,to adapt with that technology as it evolves,99
NA,over the years.,99
NA,I have no complaint about the govern-,99
NA,"ment, the taxpayer dollars, picking up this",99
NA,incentive. This government has been com-,99
NA,mitted since the day it got into government,99
NA,in 2007 about skills and skills enhancement.,99
NA,For more than the last decade under the,99
NA,Howard government what we saw was a,99
NA,complete reversal when it came to invest-,99
NA,ment in skills. We saw it with money being,99
NA,pulled out of the TAFE system. We saw it,99
NA,with the lack of commitment towards incen-,99
NA,tives for trade training. Although we saw a,99
NA,government creating and building Australian,99
NA,"technical colleges around the country, spend-",99
NA,ing millions and millions of dollars establish-,99
NA,"ing ATCs, what it did not do was invest in",99
NA,"trade training in many other areas, including",99
NA,in our schools. What we saw was a major,99
NA,drain on skills in this country in the trades,99
NA,"area. By 2007, employers were absolutely",99
NA,screaming out for a government which,99
NA,would take up the need to address skills.,99
NA,This bill provides two major incentives.,99
NA,"One is a training supplement, eligible to",99
NA,people who are receiving the parent payment,99
NA,and the Newstart allowance. It provides an,99
NA,additional incentive and financial support for,99
NA,those who do not have year 12 qualifications,99
NA,or the equivalent to go back and get further,99
NA,qualifications or a qualification beyond their,99
NA,schooling years. This will ensure that those,99
NA,people can enhance their prospects of em-,99
NA,ployment by allowing them to acquire skills,99
NA,a trade or a field. It may be different to the,99
NA,VET qualification that some of them may,99
NA,already have. This is very important. A time,99
NA,frame has been set out for this initiative. Be-,99
NA,"tween 1 July 2009 and 30 June 2011, persons",99
NA,"who commence the approved training, who",99
NA,are on the parenting payment or Newstart,99
NA,allowance and who commence a course of 12,99
NA,months or less in an accredited course can,99
NA,access this additional payment of $41.60 per,99
NA,fortnight to assist them-not just to assist,99
NA,them financially while they undertake those,99
NA,"studies but, importantly, to assist them in",99
NA,becoming more work ready and more able to,99
NA,compete equitably in the market when it,99
NA,comes to finding employment.,99
NA,The second initiative is the changes to the,99
NA,participation requirements for the youth al-,99
NA,lowance (other) category. These initiatives,99
NA,are directed particularly at younger people in,100
NA,our communities who may have left school,100
NA,early and who can truly benefit by going,100
NA,back and getting qualifications or additional,100
NA,qualifications in a certificate under the Aus-,100
NA,tralian Qualifications Framework. These are,100
NA,the types of certificate that employers are,100
NA,looking for and the types of skills that em-,100
NA,ployers are looking for out there in the com-,100
NA,"munity right now, at a time when the global",100
NA,economic crisis is being felt across this coun-,100
NA,try. It is being felt locally in my communities,100
NA,in my electorate. Incentives like this for,100
NA,ple who have not completed their full educa-,100
NA,tion at school are significantly beneficial. I,100
NA,had the opportunity to briefly look at the,100
NA,2006 census data for the electorate of Petrie.,100
NA,"Out of the just over 101,000 people who re-",100
NA,sponded to the question about their highest,100
NA,"level of education, 40 per cent had a highest",100
NA,level of education of grade 10 or its equiva-,100
NA,lent or lower. Although many of those would,100
NA,be older now-and it is true to say that in,100
NA,recent years more young people have been,100
NA,staying at school for longer-we still have,100
NA,too many young people dropping out of,100
NA,school before completing their year 12 or,100
NA,"equivalent qualification. In my electorate, I",100
NA,would welcome initiatives like this that will,100
NA,support those people in getting those sorts of,100
NA,qualifications.,100
NA,I know from personal experience how,100
NA,hard it can be when you do not finish your,100
NA,"schooling. I left school just after grade 10,",100
NA,"when I was 15 years old, and it was not until",100
NA,I was in my early 20s that I went back to,100
NA,night school and started doing my senior,100
NA,"equivalent. It is true, as was said in the",100
NA,ond reading speech in relation to these incen-,100
NA,"tives, that those who go back and do further",100
NA,education early in their life are more likely,100
NA,"continue that education. Certainly for me,",100
NA,after doing my senior at night school in my,100
NA,"early 20s, I then spent the next 14 years",100
NA,studying until I was admitted as a lawyer at,100
NA,"the end of the process. If I am any example,",100
NA,"there is encouragement so that, once you get",100
NA,"back into studying, you are more inclined to",100
NA,continue taking on new skills and enhancing,100
NA,your qualifications. I am not saying that,100
NA,every person who may take up this incentive,100
NA,would necessarily do that; what I am saying,100
NA,"is that, by creating these incentives, even if",100
NA,"one person takes up this initiative, gains ad-",100
NA,ditional qualifications and consequently gets,100
NA,"a job out of doing so, then these sorts of in-",100
NA,centives are worth doing. I certainly com-,100
NA,peo- mend the Rudd Labor government for put-,100
NA,ting these initiatives in place.,100
NA,In addition to the federal government's,100
NA,commitment to growing our skills base for,100
NA,"this country, I can say that the Queensland",100
NA,government equally has that approach. In,100
NA,"2007, the Queensland government intro-",100
NA,duced changes to its schooling system that,100
NA,saw the introduction of the prep year across,100
NA,every school. I was fortunate that my son,100
NA,was in that first prep year and I have seen the,100
NA,benefits come from the introduction of that,100
NA,year. Also the state government introduced at,100
NA,the same time a learn or earn approach to,100
NA,senior students. They said to the senior stu-,100
NA,"dents that, if they wanted to leave school",100
NA,"before grade 12, then they were expected to",100
NA,be either studying full-time in some other,100
NA,way or going into the workforce and getting,100
NA,a job. I certainly support those initiatives.,100
NA,"I understand, as do many youth workers in",100
NA,"my electorate, that this is not always going to",100
NA,be the case and there are going to be young,100
NA,people in every electorate who have difficul-,100
NA,ties for a whole range of reasons. They may,100
NA,"sec- be homeless, have substance abuse issues or",100
NA,have mental health issues. There are a whole,100
NA,range of issues that young people may be,100
NA,to facing. That will mean that these people can-,100
NA,not necessarily meet the requirements for the,100
NA,new youth allowance participation. What I,100
NA,"am pleased to say is that, as part of this bill,",100
NA,there is the ability in those circumstances for,100
NA,"young people to get a waiver, an exemption",101
NA,and to be considered in that context in rela-,101
NA,tion to their particular circumstances. I am,101
NA,"pleased with that because, as I said, it was",101
NA,certainly a concern raised by youth workers,101
NA,in my electorate.,101
NA,Having said that I believe that those peo-,101
NA,"ple, some of the most vulnerable young peo-",101
NA,"ple in our community, are the ones we should",101
NA,be helping the most to overcome the personal,101
NA,"circumstances that they are facing, whatever",101
NA,"they may be, so that they can earn qualifica-",101
NA,tions and become someone who has self-,101
NA,"esteem, who believes that they can go out",101
NA,and compete in the workforce like any other,101
NA,person and have new skills and the confi-,101
NA,"dence to get a job, and to have the quality of",101
NA,life that every person in this country deserves,101
NA,to have. For all of those reasons I commend,101
NA,this bill to the House.,101
Mr CRAIG THOMSON ,Dobell) (6.12,101
NA,pm)-Last week I was able to attend the,101
NA,launch of a very positive initiative put to-,101
NA,gether by group training and registered train-,101
NA,ing organisations which operate in my elec-,101
NA,torate of Dobell on the Central Coast of New,101
NA,South Wales. This particular initiative was,101
NA,called Adopt an Apprentice program and,101
NA,aims to find new employers willing to take,101
NA,on apprentices who have unfortunately lost,101
NA,their places with other small businesses be-,101
NA,cause of the economic downturn or through,101
NA,similar circumstances. At the launch of the,101
NA,program the future was looking brighter for,101
NA,20 job seekers who formed the target number,101
NA,"under this program. Out of the 20, five",101
NA,places had already been found as the pro-,101
NA,"gram was being launched, so there were al-",101
NA,ready five apprentices with new employers.,101
NA,The fact that employers are willing to take,101
NA,on young apprentices who have had to be put,101
NA,off elsewhere is largely because these job,101
NA,"seekers already have some training, experi-",101
NA,ence and skills. Also the truth is that these,101
NA,young people are ready and willing to work.,101
NA,They have confidence because they have,101
NA,shown up to their workplaces. Their employ-,101
NA,ers and work mates have supported and en-,101
NA,couraged them. Their confidence came,101
NA,through being backed up by skills learned,101
NA,and training received while on the job. They,101
NA,are ready to try again with a new employer;,101
NA,someone who is willing to take on a keen,101
NA,"young person, who, in turn, wants to get",101
NA,ahead with his or her apprenticeship and,101
NA,reach the goal they set out to achieve at the,101
NA,"start, and that is to be trade qualified.",101
NA,One of the registered trainers at the launch,101
NA,raised concerns about the lack of apprentices,101
NA,generally in the workplace. The man was in,101
NA,his 50s and had worked at Garden Island,101
NA,with over 400 apprentices in various trades,101
NA,working around him when he was a young,101
NA,apprentice. He reminisced about a time when,101
NA,"there were many opportunities, and he said",101
NA,that the program that they were launching on,101
NA,the Central Coast was in some small way,101
NA,going to make sure that the apprentices who,101
NA,were in the system could complete the train-,101
NA,ing they needed and acquire the skills re-,101
NA,quired for the economy that we have on the,101
NA,Central Coast. We need to give our young,101
NA,people job skills for the future. Without this,101
NA,sort of investment we will find ourselves in a,101
NA,"hole in a few years time, with a drastic lack",101
NA,of skills.,101
NA,Such neglect for future needs happened,101
NA,under the previous government and we must,101
NA,not let it happen again. We must be in a posi-,101
NA,tion to make sure we continue to train new,101
NA,young people and encourage them to take on,101
NA,further training so that as the economy,101
NA,comes out of the global recession we have,101
NA,the necessary skills to make sure that the,101
NA,economies both locally and on the Central,101
NA,Coast can take advantage of those skills.,101
NA,When the economy recovers we will have in,101
NA,place a better skill base for our young people,101
NA,to help them get ready for the workforce.,101
NA,"Setting that up, especially in places such as",102
NA,"my electorate, is absolutely vital. On the",102
NA,"Central Coast, according to the last available",102
NA,"figures, youth unemployment reached around",102
NA,37 per cent. I am speaking about an area,102
NA,where these types of programs are absolutely,102
NA,essential. We have always had high youth,102
NA,"unemployment, but with the global financial",102
NA,crisis we have seen it rise in the last six,102
NA,months from just over 25 per cent to just,102
NA,over 37 per cent. That is why I am support-,102
NA,ing the Social Security Amendment (Train-,102
NA,ing Incentives) Bill 2009. It is vital that,102
NA,sort of training be introduced and that these,102
NA,incentives be given so that young people in,102
NA,my area can get a fair shake.,102
NA,The bill introduces a new training sup-,102
NA,plement to assist low-skill job seekers re-,102
NA,ceiving Newstart allowance or parenting,102
NA,payment to undertake approved training.,102
NA,This will in turn support better employment,102
NA,opportunities for those job seekers. The bill,102
NA,will assist low-skill job seekers with the,102
NA,costs of participating in training or further,102
NA,education which may assist them to secure,102
NA,employment in the future. The bill will en-,102
NA,courage more young people to gain the edu-,102
NA,cation and skills they need to move into fur-,102
NA,"ther education or employment, recognising",102
NA,that youth with limited education are particu-,102
NA,larly vulnerable to becoming unemployed in,102
NA,the long term. The changes will be mirrored,102
NA,in changes to family tax benefit A proposed,102
NA,to commence from January 2010. These,102
NA,changes will proceed separately.,102
NA,"Any opportunity for job seekers is vital,",102
NA,"especially in regions such as mine, the Cen-",102
NA,"tral Coast, where young people have constant",102
NA,difficulty in finding work. Not only do we,102
NA,have 37 per cent youth unemployment but 30,102
NA,per cent of the workforce commute to Syd-,102
NA,ney every day when they would prefer to,102
NA,work on the Central Coast. This initiative,102
NA,supports the government's commitment to,102
NA,improve the educational attainment level of,102
NA,Australians by encouraging completion of,102
NA,year 12 or equivalent and a commitment to,102
NA,unemployed Australians to provide improved,102
NA,access to education and training opportuni-,102
NA,ties through Job Services Australia and the,102
NA,Productivity Places Program.,102
NA,The training supplement will be available,102
NA,to Newstart allowance and parenting pay-,102
NA,ment recipients who have not completed year,102
NA,12 or who have a trade or vocational qualifi-,102
NA,cation that could be upgraded to better equip,102
NA,them to find future employment. Job seekers,102
NA,this meeting these requirements will receive an,102
NA,extra $41.60 per fortnight if they fully meet,102
NA,the activity test or participation requirements,102
NA,by undertaking approved training or further,102
NA,education at the certificate II or certificate III,102
NA,levels. The training supplement will be,102
NA,available for people commencing approved,102
NA,training between 1 July 2009 and 30 June,102
NA,2011. The training supplement will be avail-,102
NA,able under any approved training com-,102
NA,menced in this period when it is completed.,102
NA,"It is estimated that over 50,000 low-skill job",102
NA,seekers will be assisted over this period.,102
NA,"The New South Wales Central Coast, as",102
NA,"well as having high youth unemployment,",102
NA,"has very low school retention rates, well be-",102
NA,low the benchmarks set at both national and,102
NA,"state levels. In fact, less than 50 per cent of",102
NA,people attending school complete year 12.,102
NA,The object of this bill is to encourage young,102
NA,people to remain in education and training,102
NA,until they have completed year 12 or equiva-,102
NA,lent so they can improve their employment,102
NA,prospects and are equipped to find jobs as,102
NA,the economy improves. These changes sup-,102
NA,port the youth compact and the national,102
NA,youth participation requirements agreed by,102
NA,COAG on 30 April 2009. This measure will,102
NA,also assist in bringing forward the COAG,102
NA,target of 90 per cent year 12 or equivalent,102
NA,attainment from 2020 to 2015. As you can,102
NA,"see, on the Central Coast we have a long way",102
NA,to go when we have an under 50 per cent,102
NA,completion level at the moment and want to,103
NA,meet 90 per cent by 2015. It is only by hav-,103
NA,ing the government take action in these ar-,103
NA,"eas, through bills such as this, that there is",103
NA,some chance of that actually occurring.,103
NA,Youth allowance will be payable to young,103
NA,people without year 12 or an equivalent,103
NA,qualification if they study full time or if they,103
NA,comply with the youth allowance employ-,103
NA,"ment pathway plan, which requires 25 hours",103
NA,a week in a combination of part-time study,103
NA,"or training, in combination with other ap-",103
NA,proved activities. These requirements will,103
NA,apply until the young person attains year 12,103
NA,or equivalent certificate level II qualification.,103
NA,Exemptions will apply where no training is,103
NA,reasonably available or the person does not,103
NA,have the capacity to undertake the training,103
NA,that is available. These amendments will,103
NA,apply to new applicants for youth allowance,103
NA,from 1 July 2009. The requirements will be,103
NA,progressively implemented for existing,103
NA,youth allowance recipients without year 12,103
NA,or the equivalent between January and July,103
NA,2010.,103
NA,The main points of the bill are the follow-,103
NA,"ing. The training supplement is an additional,",103
NA,"time limited, payment of $41.60 per fortnight",103
NA,to help eligible job seekers who participate in,103
NA,approved study or training. It will be avail-,103
NA,able for courses commenced between 1 July,103
NA,2009 and 30 June 2011. The government is,103
NA,introducing this payment to encourage and,103
NA,support low-skilled income support recipi-,103
NA,ents with the costs of undertaking training or,103
NA,further education to assist them to secure,103
NA,employment in the future. The training sup-,103
NA,plement will assist job seekers receiving,103
NA,Newstart allowance or parenting payment,103
NA,who have not completed year 12 or the,103
NA,equivalent or who have a trade or vocational,103
NA,qualification which could be upgraded to,103
NA,better equip them to find future employment.,103
NA,Job seekers will need to participate in ap-,103
NA,proved education or training to receive the,103
NA,training supplement. For some people this,103
NA,"may mean full-time study. Others, such as",103
NA,"people with a partial capacity to work, would",103
NA,meet their participation requirements through,103
NA,part-time study. The sorts of approved,103
NA,courses that people will need to do include,103
NA,certificate II to certificate III courses which,103
NA,can be approved. Generally courses would,103
NA,run for at least one semester and can be up to,103
NA,12 months in duration. People wanting to do,103
NA,a course for longer than 12 months may be,103
NA,eligible for student income support pay-,103
NA,ments. The reason why the training supple-,103
NA,ment is time limited is straightforward,103
NA,enough: the training supplement will be,103
NA,available for two years to provide an en-,103
NA,hanced incentive for job seekers to gain,103
NA,skills and qualifications during the global,103
NA,downturn. This makes sure that we do not,103
NA,have a generation that is forgotten because of,103
NA,the global financial crisis.,103
NA,We need to be making sure that not only,103
NA,are we stimulating jobs through the decisive,103
NA,action the government is taking with the,103
NA,stimulus packages but also those young peo-,103
NA,ple are being equipped with the skills neces-,103
NA,sary to participate in the economy as it,103
NA,comes out of recession-that they are not,103
NA,"being left on the scrap heap, that they are",103
NA,given the opportunity to train and retrain. Job,103
NA,seekers who participate in the Productivity,103
NA,Places Program will not have to pay for their,103
NA,"course. However, not all courses taken up",103
NA,will be provided through the Productivity,103
NA,Places Program. Some may be through a,103
NA,state or territory subsidised TAFE or RTO,103
NA,"place. In such cases, normal course fees will",103
NA,"apply. As is currently the case, these course",103
NA,costs are the responsibility of the student. In,103
NA,addition to the assistance provided by the,103
NA,"fortnightly training supplement, over the pe-",103
NA,riod 1 January 2009 to 30 June 2010 recipi-,103
NA,ents of Newstart allowance and parenting,103
NA,payment who undertake approved study or,104
NA,training are also eligible for the education,104
NA,entry payment of $208 and the $950 educa-,104
NA,tion entry payment supplement of the Train-,104
NA,ing and Learning Bonus.,104
NA,"Looking at the training places, the enti-",104
NA,tlement to an education or training place is,104
NA,for any government subsidised qualification.,104
NA,Training places will come from a range of,104
NA,"existing sources, including the Australian",104
NA,government's Productivity Places Program.,104
NA,"This program is providing 711,000 training",104
NA,places over five years to ensure that Austra-,104
NA,lians develop the skills that they and industry,104
NA,"need. Of these, 319,000 places, including",104
NA,"20,000 places for workers who may need to",104
NA,"be re-skilled, are for job seekers; and",104
NA,"392,000 training places are allocated for ex-",104
NA,isting workers wanting to gain or upgrade,104
NA,their skills.,104
NA,As part of the compact with young Austra-,104
NA,"lians, young people under 20 who are work-",104
NA,ing up to 15 hours per week will be eligible,104
NA,for Productivity Places Program training,104
NA,"places. For this program to work, some",104
NA,changes will have to be made. From 1 July,104
NA,"2009, young people seeking youth allowance",104
NA,without year 12 or equivalent will be as-,104
NA,sessed against new participation require-,104
NA,"ments. Under these new requirements, to",104
NA,receive youth allowance young people under,104
NA,21 years of age without year 12 or equivalent,104
NA,will need to: participate in education and,104
NA,training full-time; or participate full-time-,104
NA,"that is, generally for at least 25 hours a",104
NA,"week-in part-time study or training, in",104
NA,"combination with other approved activities,",104
NA,until they gain year 12 or all equivalent cer-,104
NA,tificate II qualifications. Young people al-,104
NA,ready receiving youth allowance who do not,104
NA,have year 12 or equivalent qualifications will,104
NA,make the transition to the new requirements,104
NA,between 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2010.,104
NA,It is fair to remind the House why the,104
NA,government is making these changes. Part of,104
NA,the reason is that the changes support the,104
NA,youth compact and national youth participa-,104
NA,tion requirements agreed by COAG on 30,104
NA,April 2009. Looking closely at these time,104
NA,"frames, the changes will apply to all young",104
NA,people without year 12 or an equivalent,104
NA,qualification claiming youth allowance from,104
NA,1 January 2009 and to existing youth allow-,104
NA,ance recipients without year 12 or the,104
NA,equivalent who are not full-time students,104
NA,from 1 January 2010. In order to allow,104
NA,young people already receiving youth allow-,104
NA,"ance time to consider their options, the new",104
NA,requirements will be progressively imple-,104
NA,mented for this group between January 2010,104
NA,and July 2010.,104
NA,Going over the requirements for young,104
NA,people who obtain year 12 or the equivalent,104
NA,"qualification, the existing youth allowance",104
NA,participation requirements will continue for,104
NA,21-year-olds who have received year 12 or,104
NA,the equivalent qualifications. This group of,104
NA,young people is not affected by the measure.,104
NA,The question has been raised that the new,104
NA,participation measures might punish disad-,104
NA,vantaged young people. Past economic,104
NA,downturns have demonstrated that young,104
NA,people with limited education and skills are,104
NA,particularly vulnerable to long-term unem-,104
NA,ployment. They struggle to find employment,104
NA,even when the economy recovers.,104
NA,The arrangements will be flexible for,104
NA,young people with complex needs. For ex-,104
NA,"ample, young people with multiple barriers",104
NA,such as homelessness or substance abuse,104
NA,issues who would qualify for stream 4 under,104
NA,Job Services Australia arrangements will,104
NA,meet their requirements by participating in,104
NA,"this service stream. Similarly, young people",104
NA,with a partial capacity to work will have,104
NA,their hours of participation tailored to their,104
NA,"assessed capacity. If eligible, they can also",104
NA,meet their requirements by participating in,104
NA,disability employment services. The range of,105
NA,existing activity test exemptions based on,105
NA,"personal circumstances, such as temporary",105
NA,"medical incapacity or major personal crisis,",105
NA,will continue to be available. This will en-,105
NA,sure appropriate safeguards are in place to,105
NA,cover periods that young people cannot par-,105
NA,ticipate.,105
NA,It is also useful to clear up any concerns,105
NA,about the availability of education or training,105
NA,"places. As part of the COAG youth compact,",105
NA,state and territory governments have com-,105
NA,mitted to immediate action to ensure suffi-,105
NA,cient school and training places are available,105
NA,"to young people aged 15 to 19, who will",105
NA,have an entitlement to an education or train-,105
NA,ing place for any government subsidised,105
NA,qualification. This commitment will be fully,105
NA,implemented by 1 July 2009. Enrolments,105
NA,will be subject to admission requirements,105
NA,"and course availability. In addition, young",105
NA,people aged 20 to 24 will have an entitle-,105
NA,ment to an education or training place for,105
NA,any government subsidised qualification,105
NA,which would result in the individual attain-,105
NA,ing a higher qualification. The commitment,105
NA,to 20-to 24-year-olds will be fully imple-,105
NA,mented by 1 January 2010. Enrolment will,105
NA,be subject to admission requirements and,105
NA,course availability.,105
NA,State and territory governments will work,105
NA,with their education authorities and training,105
NA,providers to make arrangements for deter-,105
NA,mining eligibility for an entitlement place. It,105
NA,is anticipated that most places will be pro-,105
NA,vided by TAFEs and some by private regis-,105
NA,tered training organisations offering govern-,105
NA,ment subsidised qualifications. Common-,105
NA,"wealth, state and territory governments will",105
NA,also work with training providers to address,105
NA,issues relating to the provision of places in,105
NA,rural and remote locations. Exemptions will,105
NA,apply in cases where there are no locally ac-,105
NA,cessible training courses or appropriate dis-,105
NA,tance education options. Job Services Austra-,105
NA,lia providers will also have the capacity to,105
NA,help young people gain access to education,105
NA,"and training programs to improve their skills,",105
NA,including places in the government's Produc-,105
NA,tivity Places Program.,105
NA,"Deputy Speaker Adams, you can see",105
NA,through this bill that the government is,105
NA,"committed to helping young people, who",105
NA,might not have the best chances of gaining,105
NA,"long-term employment, gain the necessary",105
NA,skills to give them a better chance. It is,105
NA,aimed at those young people who have not,105
NA,"completed year 12 or the equivalent, or who",105
NA,have a trade or vocational qualification,105
NA,which could be upgraded to better equip,105
NA,them to find future employment. The budget,105
NA,announcement for this measure stated that,105
NA,the changes to participation requirements for,105
NA,youth allowance are to come into effect on 1,105
NA,January 2009 for new claimants without year,105
NA,12 or the equivalent and from 1 January,105
NA,2010 for existing recipients without year 12,105
NA,or the equivalent. Budget announcements,105
NA,also stated that the training supplement,105
NA,would commence from 1 July 2009. For,105
NA,young Australians hoping to upgrade their,105
NA,"skills-such as from electorates like mine,",105
NA,with 37 per cent youth unemployment and,105
NA,less than 50 per cent of people going on to,105
NA,year 12-the opportunities provided by this,105
NA,legislation cannot be overstated. It is vitally,105
NA,important that there are no delays in this leg-,105
NA,islation. I commend the bill to the House.,105
Mr CLARE ,Blaxland-Parliamentary,105
NA,Secretary for Employment) (6.30 pm)-I,105
NA,thank all members for their contribution to,105
NA,this debate. The Social Security Amendment,105
NA,(Training Incentives) Bill 2009 is part of the,105
NA,government's strategy to keep Australia,105
NA,working and set us up for the future. It cre-,105
NA,"ates new incentives to train and learn, to help",105
NA,young people now and to make sure we have,105
NA,the skills we need as the global economy,105
NA,recovers. Unemployment is the biggest chal-,105
NA,lenge we face. It is the biggest challenge,105
NA,governments face all round the world. In,106
NA,"America, unemployment has almost doubled",106
NA,in the last 18 months and now stands at 9.4,106
NA,per cent-the highest it has been in the last,106
NA,25 years. Australia is doing better than most.,106
NA,Unemployment is lower here than in any,106
NA,"other major advanced economy bar Japan,",106
NA,but there is a tough road ahead. Unemploy-,106
NA,ment is projected to rise.,106
NA,When workers lose their job it does not,106
NA,"just hurt the individual and their family, it",106
NA,hurts our economy. We lose skills and ex-,106
NA,perience-the skills and experience that we,106
NA,need to come out the other side of the global,106
NA,recession stronger and more competitive than,106
NA,before. We cannot stop the global recession,106
NA,"hitting us, but we can reduce its impact. That",106
NA,"is why the government is rolling out 35,000",106
NA,job sites across the country over the next 12,106
NA,"months, providing tax breaks to small busi-",106
NA,"ness and introducing this legislation, which",106
NA,is part of the jobs and training compact an-,106
NA,nounced by the Prime Minister in April this,106
NA,year.,106
NA,"The bill before us does two things. First,",106
NA,introduces a temporary training supplement.,106
NA,This payment will be made to people who,106
NA,are amongst the most vulnerable to long-,106
NA,term unemployment: recipients of Newstart,106
NA,and the parenting payment who have not,106
NA,completed year 12 or an equivalent qualifica-,106
NA,tion or those who have a trade qualification,106
NA,that needs to be upgraded. The training sup-,106
NA,plement of an extra $41.60 a fortnight will be,106
NA,made to Newstart and parenting payment,106
NA,recipients without a year 12 or an equivalent,106
NA,qualification who start an approved course of,106
NA,study or training between 1 July 2009 and 30,106
NA,"June 2011. It is estimated that 50,000 people",106
NA,"will benefit from this. Second, the bill",106
NA,changes the participation requirements for,106
NA,youth allowance (other). To obtain youth,106
NA,"allowance (other), young people without",106
NA,year 12 or equivalent qualification will now,106
NA,need to participate in education and training.,106
NA,The purpose is to encourage young people to,106
NA,remain in study or training until they com-,106
NA,plete a basic educational or training qualifi-,106
NA,cation-to make sure young people are,106
NA,learning or earning.,106
NA,The logic behind these reforms is simple.,106
NA,Unemployment hits some communities and,106
NA,some groups harder than others. Young peo-,106
NA,ple and workers with low skills are particu-,106
NA,larly vulnerable. Since September last year,106
NA,unemployment amongst young people aged,106
NA,15 to 24 has grown at a faster rate than it has,106
NA,amongst the rest of the population. The more,106
NA,"skills and education people have, the more",106
NA,likely they are to be employed and the more,106
NA,they are likely to be paid. The former Minis-,106
NA,ter for Employment Participation made this,106
NA,point in his second reading speech:,106
NA,"By age 24, only seven out of 10 young people",106
NA,without a year 12 or certificate III or IV qualifica-,106
NA,tion are in further training or employment. By,106
NA,"contrast, nine out of 10 young people with such a",106
NA,qualification are in further training or employ-,106
NA,ment.,106
NA,"it In other words, skills count. Qualifications",106
NA,are important. The lesson from the recession,106
NA,of the early nineties is that youth unemploy-,106
NA,ment rises quickly and can take a long time,106
NA,"to fall. Then, one in three young people who",106
NA,had not completed year 12 were unem-,106
NA,ployed. They were three times more likely to,106
NA,be unemployed than someone who had com-,106
NA,pleted year 12. These are the facts.,106
NA,The long-term consequence of this is en-,106
NA,trenched disadvantage. Long-term unem-,106
NA,ployment has a devastating impact on indi-,106
NA,viduals and on families. It also has a long-,106
NA,term impact on the productivity and competi-,106
NA,tiveness of our economy. That is why this,106
NA,bill is important. It is part of a comprehen-,106
NA,sive strategy to reduce the risk of long-term,106
NA,unemployment and build the skills that we,106
NA,need to compete in a world beyond the,106
NA,global recession; to keep Australia working. I,106
NA,commend the bill to the House.,106

NA,That this bill be now read a second time.,107
Mr ABBOTT ,Warringah) (6.35 pm)-I,107
NA,do not intend to detain the House long at all,107
NA,on this bill because the Social Security Leg-,107
NA,islation Amendment (Improved Support for,107
NA,Carers) (Consequential and Transitional) Bill,107
NA,2009 is about as uncontroversial as a piece of,107
NA,legislation can be. That does not necessarily,107
NA,mean that there will not be any contention in,107
NA,"the House, but I am fairly confident that the",107
NA,contention will be over other aspects of so-,107
NA,"cial security policy, not about the particular",107
NA,provisions of this bill. Essentially what this,107
NA,bill does is change the criterion for carers to,107
NA,go on the carer payment from one deter-,107
NA,mined by medical classification to one de-,107
NA,termined by the actual level of care provided.,107
NA,"As well, it changes the terminology of dis-",107
NA,ability to something more appropriate and,107
NA,more sensitive to the modern ear. It is essen-,107
NA,tially housekeeping. It will benefit many,107
NA,"thousands of people over time, as the cost-",107
NA,ings reflect. The opposition support this bill,107
NA,and we commend it to the House.,107
Ms ANNETTE ELLIS ,Canberra) (6.37,107
NA,pm)-It is indeed a pleasure to rise this eve-,107
NA,ning to speak in support of the Social Secu-,107
NA,rity Legislation Amendment (Improved Sup-,107
NA,port for Carers) (Consequential and Transi-,107
NA,tional) Bill 2009. As has probably been said,107
NA,"by other members, the earlier bill, the Social",107
NA,Security Legislation Amendment (Improved,107
NA,"Support for Carers) Bill 2009, provides part",107
NA,of the government's response to the report of,107
NA,the Carer Payment (child) Review Taskforce.,107
NA,It gives effect to a number of measures,107
NA,aimed at improving assistance to carers from,107
NA,1 July this year. The bill we are debating to-,107
NA,night is the companion bill to the improved,107
NA,"support for carers bill, which has passed",107
NA,through the House already. This bill now,107
NA,"comes in, as the previous speaker said, to put",107
NA,into effect most of the provisions required,107
NA,for carers in this area. I am really very,107
NA,pleased to see this happening and to be part,107
NA,of the clarification process in the parliament,107
NA,tonight.,107
NA,"As most members will be aware, a com-",107
NA,mittee I chair recently provided a report to,107
NA,the parliament on the role of carers in our,107
NA,society. Through that process we had the,107
NA,"opportunity-and the privilege, I might",107
NA,add-to speak and listen to literally hundreds,107
NA,and hundreds of carers around the country.,107
NA,We had the opportunity to hear precisely,107
NA,"what they had to say about their lives, the",107
NA,impact of the caring role on their lives and,107
NA,the sorts of things that they saw as important,107
NA,in attempting to lighten the load or to make,107
NA,their journey through their life of caring a,107
NA,little bit more bearable and manageable.,107
NA,Many of the things that are in this bill answer,107
NA,some of those questions and will make things,107
NA,"a lot better for many carers. For instance, the",107
NA,amendments will include the removal of ref-,107
NA,"erences in social security law which, from 1",107
NA,"July this year, will be redundant and the re-",107
NA,placement of those references with the new,107
NA,terms necessary for the proper administration,108
NA,of the changes to be introduced.,108
NA,There are a couple of things I would like,108
NA,"to mention briefly, if I may, which really will",108
NA,have a great effect on the day-to-day lives of,108
NA,these people. One of them is the 63-day rule.,108
NA,Amendments made by this bill will provide,108
NA,that carers who qualify for the carer payment,108
NA,under the new qualification provisions will,108
NA,be able to take advantage of the existing,108
NA,"benefits for carers. For example, under the",108
NA,"63-day rule, carers can temporarily cease to",108
NA,provide constant care but remain qualified,108
NA,for the carer payment. What this new provi-,108
NA,"sion will mean is that, if you are in a caring",108
NA,role and the person for whom you are caring,108
NA,has a period in hospital or a period of respite,108
NA,"care for up to 63 days per annum, the carer",108
NA,payment will continue to be made. That,108
NA,makes life a whole heap easier. The cost of,108
NA,caring does not necessarily dissolve into,108
NA,nothing just because the person you are of-,108
NA,fering that care to is not literally in your,108
NA,"house or under your care. As I said, they",108
NA,could be in hospital or respite care or a simi-,108
NA,lar type of arrangement. I think this is a,108
NA,really sensible provision and will be very,108
NA,welcome for a number of people out there.,108
NA,One of the other provisions is the special,108
NA,backdating for the carer payment. Given that,108
NA,"this is a new regime, a new order of things,",108
NA,and knowing the frantic lives that these peo-,108
NA,"ple lead, it may take a little while for some",108
NA,them to access the new forms and the new,108
NA,transitional arrangements. Between 1 July,108
NA,"and 1 October this year, if there is evidence",108
NA,in an application from a treating health pro-,108
NA,fessional indicating that the carer would have,108
NA,been qualified for the payment within that,108
NA,period-had they known that they could in,108
NA,fact have made that application or had they,108
NA,had the time to make the application-the,108
NA,"application can be backdated, as a transi-",108
NA,tional arrangement under the new rules. So,108
NA,between 1 July and 1 October this year there,108
NA,"is a little bit of flexibility, given the right",108
NA,"circumstances, for the carer in question to be",108
NA,accommodated through the application proc-,108
NA,"ess, should that be required. Again, that",108
NA,makes it just that bit easier for these people,108
NA,and offers some understanding of the types,108
NA,of situations that they find themselves in and,108
NA,the pressures that we all know they face. I do,108
NA,"not know how other members feel, but I",108
NA,know that in my own life sometimes I can be,108
NA,very busy. Sometimes paperwork flows,108
NA,through your letterbox and you are not really,108
NA,sure how quickly you will be able to look at,108
NA,"it. If you are in a caring role, I tell you, it can",108
NA,be all the more difficult. It is hard enough in,108
NA,"normal life, let alone in those sorts of cir-",108
NA,cumstances.,108
NA,I am really very pleased to see that we are,108
NA,"now progressing. As I said, the original bill",108
NA,"has gone through the House, and I believe it",108
NA,is now in the other place. We now have this,108
NA,machinery piece of legislation which will put,108
NA,into place the provisions that were alluded to,108
NA,in the earlier bill. This bill makes them all,108
NA,"technically possible. I am very, very happy to",108
NA,"think that we are going to see this happen,",108
NA,that we are going to see the progress brought,108
NA,about by these legislative changes. I have,108
NA,"only mentioned a couple of them in brief, but",108
NA,I know that for the carers that we have spo-,108
NA,ken to through our inquiry process and the,108
NA,people that we all know in our constituencies,108
NA,of this is really going to make a difference. That,108
NA,"is what we are all here for, I believe, as par-",108
NA,liamentarians. In cases like this we can actu-,108
NA,ally make a practical difference to the lives,108
NA,of people who really need assistance. So I,108
NA,welcome this bill. As technical as it may be,108
NA,"in some cases, it will put into action the pro-",108
NA,visions of the previous piece of legislation.,108
NA,"Importantly, it builds on the work of the",108
NA,"Carer Payment (child) Review Taskforce,",108
NA,which set this in train in the first place. I am,108
NA,proud to be a member of the government that,108
NA,set that up. I am proud that we are now see-,108
NA,ing the provisions come in and that the bene-,109
NA,fits will flow through to those who have car-,109
NA,ing roles in our community. I welcome this,109
NA,legislation into the House.,109
Ms LEY ,Farrer) (6.44 pm)-Like the,109
NA,"previous two speakers, I welcome the Social",109
NA,Security Legislation Amendment (Improved,109
NA,Support for Carers) (Consequential and,109
NA,Transitional) Bill 2009. It is insignificant and,109
NA,"technical in itself, but it is part of a very im-",109
NA,portant range of measures that will make life,109
NA,easier for carers. As our opposition spokes-,109
NA,"man said a few moments ago, there would be",109
NA,few less contentious pieces of legislation to,109
NA,"go through the House. So, of course, we in",109
NA,the opposition welcome the measures in this,109
NA,bill and the changes that they will help bring,109
NA,to the lives of carers.,109
NA,I was privileged to be part of the Standing,109
NA,"Committee on Family, Community, Housing",109
NA,and Youth for a short while last year and to,109
NA,commence work on the inquiry that was ta-,109
NA,bled recently. I recognise the previous,109
NA,"speaker, the member for Canberra, for her",109
NA,chairmanship of that inquiry. The report was,109
NA,called Who cares…? It really puts so much,109
NA,"of what carers feel, believe and passionately",109
NA,want into words. It was a privilege to be part,109
NA,of that committee. As members of parlia-,109
NA,"ment, every day we hear and see the results",109
NA,of people struggling with the caring role. I,109
NA,just want to touch on a couple of the special,109
NA,moments for me as part of that committee,109
NA,and the moments that encouraged me to,109
NA,work harder for carers. They were the repre-,109
NA,sentations made by young carers-those who,109
NA,are children struggling with school or in,109
NA,some cases young people at university and,109
NA,who are actually the carers in their family.,109
NA,One particular young lady said:,109
NA,… I have been caring for my father since I was 12,109
NA,years old and he retired. Over those years I did,109
NA,not have any support. It was not until the start,109
NA,this year that I found community options. So for,109
NA,seven years I was doing it on my own and attend-,109
NA,ing high school. It was not actually until I started,109
NA,university-and I am doing psychology-that I,109
NA,realised that dad could have a mental illness. I,109
NA,"went to his GP and I said, ‘Dad could have de-",109
NA,"pression'. I was told that, because I do not have a",109
NA,"medical degree, I did not know what I was talking",109
NA,about. So for six months dad went undiagnosed.,109
NA,Subsequently he took himself to hospital with,109
NA,suicidal thoughts. That was a big shock to me,109
NA,personally. For 12 months dad did not have any,109
NA,"treatment. I just want to say that, because of that,",109
NA,I would really like GPs to consider that carers are,109
NA,a big part of the lives of the people they look af-,109
NA,ter.,109
NA,I do not read that third-party quote to criti-,109
NA,"cise GPs at all, but simply to say that the",109
NA,issue of carers and those that they look after,109
NA,is a community-wide issue and everybody,109
NA,involved needs to be aware of this. All carers,109
NA,that come to see me in my office without,109
NA,"question, apart from being exhausted, talk",109
NA,about their responsibility. They talk about the,109
NA,positives as well; it is not all negative. They,109
NA,have such low expectations and they feel this,109
NA,is a burden that they have to carry very much,109
NA,on their own. If every other chain in the,109
NA,"process-including GPs, advocates, work-",109
NA,mates and everybody involved-recognised,109
NA,the enormous load that the caring role places,109
NA,on individuals and offered a bit of support,109
NA,"here and there, it would make an enormous",109
NA,difference.,109
NA,One of the other things that came out of,109
NA,my work on this committee was a forum we,109
NA,held in my home town of Albury where peo-,109
NA,ple stood up and for a few minutes gave a,109
NA,snapshot of their lives and the caring role.,109
NA,One member of the committee-I actually,109
NA,"cannot remember who it was-said, ‘You all",109
NA,"seem so calm,' and one particular woman",109
NA,"said, ‘That is because we are all so medi-",109
NA,cated.' It really struck me that in order to get,109
NA,through the day a lot of carers are themselves,109
NA,of quite understandably struggling with their,109
NA,own health issues. They really do need sup-,109
NA,port.,109
NA,"Without making this a political statement,",110
NA,in New South Wales we do certainly notice a,110
NA,lot less support than the government just,110
NA,across the border to the south gives to its,110
NA,carers and their families. With the New,110
NA,"South Wales budget on its way tomorrow, I",110
NA,really do hope that further support for this,110
NA,important area is maintained. It needs to be,110
NA,"increased, because along the border-and",110
NA,my electorate is on the border-between,110
NA,New South Wales and Victoria the frank ad-,110
NA,vice that people are receiving in New South,110
NA,Wales is to take their family to Victoria,110
NA,where the state government actually does a,110
NA,lot more for their children in school and,110
NA,gives them the respite that they desperately,110
NA,need. Respite is an enormous issue for eve-,110
NA,rybody-and I am sure this is common,110
NA,"across the board. For people under 18, there",110
NA,are day programs and places for people to go,110
NA,with their disabilities and have special,110
NA,ment. That is catered for reasonably well.,110
NA,The problem arises for families when their,110
NA,"young person turns 18, is no longer entitled",110
NA,to the same level of support or the support,110
NA,changes and-more importantly-the facili-,110
NA,ties are not there in the community.,110
NA,Just because somebody has a disability,110
NA,does not mean they want to live at home,110
NA,when they turn 18 and become a young,110
NA,adult. They still need to make their own way,110
NA,in the world and they need that level of inde-,110
NA,pendence. There is nowhere which supports,110
NA,"them, which allows them their independence,",110
NA,which gives their family that much needed,110
NA,ongoing respite and which keeps them safe,110
NA,and looks after them. I do hope that we as a,110
NA,parliament focus more attention on the needs,110
NA,of carers and that we look at the needs of,110
NA,those young adults. Good things have been,110
NA,done for autism and packages have been put,110
NA,"together, and they have made a difference for",110
NA,young people. There is early intervention at,110
NA,"school, which is a critical time in a young",110
NA,"person's life, but at the moment I am really",110
NA,detecting that some support for young adults,110
NA,with disabilities at the stage of life where,110
NA,they do want to gain some independence is,110
NA,simply not out there. I conclude by thanking,110
NA,those on all sides of the parliament who,110
NA,work hard for those carers in their electorate.,110
NA,I encourage each and every one of them to,110
NA,continue to support them in whatever way,110
NA,they can.,110
Mr TREVOR ,Flynn) (6.50 pm)-I rise,110
NA,to support the Social Security Legislation,110
NA,Amendment (Improved Support for Carers),110
NA,(Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2009.,110
NA,"As you will be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker",110
NA,"Adams, the measures in this bill are part of a",110

NA,The qualification provisions for carer,111

NA,with a severe disability or severe medical,111
NA,"condition, or care is provided to two or more",111
NA,children each with disability or medical con-,111
NA,"dition, or care is provided to a child with a",111

NA,disabled children. Qualification for care pro-,111
NA,vided to a disabled adult and one or more,111
NA,children each with a disability or medical,111
NA,condition is a new qualification provision,111
NA,that is additional to the current qualification,111
NA,provision for care provided to a disabled,111
NA,adult and a dependent child of the disabled,111
NA,adult.,111
NA,This schedule repeals references to the,111
NA,terms ‘profoundly disabled child' and ‘dis-,111
NA,abled child' where the use of the terms are,111
NA,associated with carer payment from the So-,111
NA,cial Security Act. These terms are replaced,111
NA,with terminology related to the new qualifi-,111
NA,cation provisions inserted by the improved,111
NA,support for carers bill. The amendments con-,111
NA,tained in this schedule ensure that provisions,111
NA,"contained in the Social Security Act, such as",111
NA,"the care receiver's income and assets tests,",111
NA,will apply to a person who makes a claim for,111
NA,carer payment after the commencement of,111
NA,the improved support for carers bill.,111
NA,Amendments are also made to special,111

NA,proved qualification criteria for carer pay-,111
NA,ment is reflected in the relief from the,111
NA,ity test that is applied to people who are not,111
NA,residentially qualified for carer payment.,111
NA,This schedule also makes amendments so,111
NA,that a person who is qualified for carer pay-,111
NA,ment for care provided on a short-term or,111
NA,episodic basis is not qualified for a pensioner,111
NA,concession card but is qualified for a health-,111

NA,to who can be the principal beneficiary of a,111
NA,special disability trust are amended in line,111
NA,with the improved qualification criteria for,111
NA,carer payment.,111
NA,The Rudd Labor government is committed,111
NA,to improving significantly the level of assis-,111
NA,tance for carers of children with disability or,111
NA,severe medical conditions. This bill delivers,111
NA,on that commitment. The changes in this bill,111
NA,are the latest in a series of recent support,111
NA,initiatives that have been extended to carers.,111
NA,The 2008 one-off payment legislation deliv-,111
NA,"ered $1,000 to carer payment recipients and",111
NA,"certain other pensioners with a caring role,",111
NA,"and carer allowance recipients were, gener-",111
NA,"ally, paid some $600 for each person cared",111
NA,for. Then the Economic Security Strategy,111
NA,legislation of late 2008 provided some,111
NA,"$1,400 to carer payment recipients and, gen-",111
NA,"erally, $1,000 to carer allowance recipients",111
NA,for each person cared for. These new budget,111
NA,measures are part of an $822 million package,111
NA,from the 2008 budget to support and recog-,111
NA,nise carers.,111
NA,"The amendments will deliver a new, fairer",111
NA,set of qualification criteria for carer payment,111
NA,paid in respect of a child based on the level,111
NA,of care required rather than the rigid medical,111
NA,criteria currently used to assess qualification,111
NA,for the payment. Estimates are that some,111
NA,"19,000 more carers will have access to carer",111
NA,payment from 1 July 2009.,111
NA,"As at January 2009 there were 2,795 carer",111
NA,allowance recipients and 941 carer payment,111
NA,recipients in my electorate of Flynn. The,111
NA,2006 census recorded for my electorate of,111
NA,"activFlynn 4,562 people in need of assistance.",111
NA,That is the number of people with a profound,111
NA,or severe disability. People with a profound,111
NA,or severe disability are defined as needing,111
NA,help or assistance in one or more of the three,111
NA,"core activity areas of self-care, mobility and",111
NA,communication. The 2006 census also re-,111
NA,"corded over 9,000 people in my electorate of",111
NA,Flynn who in the two weeks prior to census,111
NA,"night spent time providing unpaid care, help",111
NA,or assistance to family members or others,112
NA,"because of a disability, a long-term illness",112
NA,problems relating to old age.,112
NA,As the father of a son with a disability,112
NA,who cannot live without a life-sustaining,112
NA,medication I congratulate these wonderful,112
NA,people for their efforts. I sincerely hope that,112
NA,this legislation goes a long way to rewarding,112

NA,Being able to address matters in relation to,112
NA,the Social Security Legislation Amendment,112
NA,(Improved Support for Carers) (Consequen-,112
NA,tial and Transitional) Bill 2009 is a great,112
NA,portunity to speak on behalf of all those,112
NA,ple who undertake the important role of car-,112
NA,ing within our community. These changes to,112
NA,legislation will certainly impact on a great,112
NA,"number of people who care for others and, in",112
NA,"particular, for children who have special care",112
NA,needs.,112
NA,The bill proposes to move from focusing,112
NA,on a child's actual medical condition to fo-,112
NA,"cusing on care requirements, and this is con-",112
NA,sistent with the application of care require-,112
NA,ments for qualification for carer allowance.,112
NA,The new Disability Care Load Assessment,112
NA,"(Child) Determination, to be introduced by",112
NA,"this bill, is intended to provide an objective",112
NA,tool for assessing the care requirements of,112
NA,care recipients. Assessing care requirements,112
NA,in relation to children is complicated by the,112
NA,fact that all children need a certain level of,112
NA,care appropriate to their age and level of,112
NA,"turity. However, children with severe illness",112
NA,or those recovering from an accident may,112
NA,need considerable extra care.,112
NA,Despite the broadening in 2006 of eligibil-,112
NA,ity for carer payments to carers of children,112
NA,"with severe intellectual, psychiatric or be-",112
NA,havioural disabilities requiring constant care,112
NA,"or supervision, it became apparent that, in",112
NA,"fact, few families qualified for the carer",112
NA,"or payment. Although there were 113,549 car-",112
NA,ers receiving carer allowance to assist them,112
NA,with costs involved in caring for a child with,112
NA,"a disability in June 2008, the narrow criteria",112
NA,"meant that in practice only 7,000 children",112
NA,were being cared for by people receiving the,112
NA,"carer payment, so there has been an obvious",112
NA,disconnect due to the tight eligibility criteria.,112
NA,A recent report following an inquiry by,112
NA,the House of Representatives Standing,112
NA,"Committee on Family, Community, Housing",112
NA,"and Youth, of which I am deputy chair, high-",112
NA,lighted the great hardship encountered by,112
NA,"many carers, who felt that they were not be-",112
NA,oping adequately supported in the caring role.,112
NA,peo- The Who cares …? report made it clear that,112
NA,there were common concerns amongst carers,112
NA,regardless of what kind of caring role they,112
NA,undertook. They were united by the chal-,112
NA,"lenge they faced, and it became abundantly",112
NA,clear that insufficient attention was being,112
NA,paid to caring for the needs of carers. One of,112
NA,those needs is to simplify the maze of bu-,112
NA,reaucratic red tape and the hoops that carers,112
NA,must jump through to access support. No,112
NA,group could be more worthy of clearing a,112
NA,more certain path than those caring for chil-,112
NA,dren with a serious illness or disability.,112
NA,The care requirements for carer allowance,112
NA,are far less rigorous than the care require-,112
NA,"ment for carer payment, and the care re-",112
NA,quirements for carer payment for a person,112
NA,caring for an adult are also less rigorous than,112
NA,the care requirements for caring for a child.,112
NA,ma- The differential was explained away by an,112
NA,assumption that all parents of young children,112
NA,"engage in the caring role. However, the as-",112
NA,sumption did not take into account the addi-,112
NA,tional care responsibilities of those parents,112
NA,who care for children who have a disability,112
NA,or severe medical condition.,112
NA,"In an endeavour to rectify this, in 2007 the",112
NA,Howard government introduced a carer ad-,112
NA,"justment payment of up to $10,000. The",113
NA,carer adjustment payment was available,113
NA,where a family had a child aged up to six,113
NA,years who was diagnosed with a major dis-,113
NA,ability due to an accidental injury or a severe,113
NA,illness. Carer adjustment payment was an,113
NA,interim payment available while the review,113
NA,of carer payment for carers of children with a,113
NA,medical condition was being conducted. It,113
NA,"was to terminate on 30 June 2008, but fund-",113
NA,ing was provided in the 2008 budget for,113
NA,carer adjustment payment to continue to be,113
NA,available past that date.,113
NA,A review task force headed by Anthony,113
NA,Blunn was established in March 2007 to ex-,113
NA,amine the effectiveness of carer payment as a,113
NA,safety net for carers of children with pro-,113
NA,found disabilities or severe medical condi-,113
NA,tions. The terms of reference recognised that,113
NA,a carer payment is an income support pay-,113
NA,"ment for carers who, because of the demands",113
NA,"of their caring role, are unable to support",113
NA,themselves through substantial participation,113
NA,"in the workforce. The report of the review,",113
NA,"released in early 2008, concluded that carer",113
NA,payment did not provide the intended safety,113
NA,net and recommended changes that are now,113
NA,the subject of this bill.,113
NA,Some of the 32 recommendations in the,113
NA,Blunn review were changes to eligibility re-,113
NA,quirements and a new assessment process to,113
NA,recognise the level of care required by the,113
NA,care receiver and provided by the carer; bet-,113
NA,ter support for carers through improved ser-,113
NA,"vice delivery, including case coordination",113
NA,and more accessible information about pay-,113
NA,ments; increased support for carers to par-,113
NA,ticipate in the workforce through improved,113
NA,"access to the Job Network, help with child-",113
NA,care arrangements and assistance for em-,113
NA,ployers; and increased recognition for carers,113
NA,through carer recognition legislation and a,113
NA,"national action plan for carers. It is interestability,",113
NA,ing to note that there have been many inquir-,113
NA,ies into and reviews of this issue over the,113
NA,"years, and in every case they have come up",113
NA,with very similar conclusions.,113
NA,"More recently, the bill was referred to the",113
NA,Senate Standing Committee on Community,113
NA,Affairs. A submission was made to that,113
NA,committee by the Disability Services Com-,113
NA,"mission of Western Australia, which was",113
NA,very positive about the benefits of the,113
NA,changes that we are discussing tonight and,113
NA,the way in which they would make for better,113
NA,support for carers. The Director-General of,113
NA,the Disability Services Commission of West-,113
NA,"ern Australia, Dr Ron Chalmers, commented",113
NA,specifically on the bill's ability to ease the,113
NA,financial hardship for carers.,113
NA,"As I said earlier, few people are eligible",113
NA,for the carer payment in its current form. The,113
NA,changes outlined in this bill will ensure that a,113
NA,"further 19,000 carers of children will now",113
NA,qualify for a carer payment. This is a very,113
NA,welcome change indeed. The bill changes the,113
NA,way eligibility is assessed for carer payment,113
NA,for those caring for a child. Currently eligi-,113
NA,"bility is based, as I said, on a child's disabil-",113
NA,ity or medical condition. The new methodol-,113
NA,ogy for assessing eligibility will be through,113
NA,the disallowable legislative instrument re-,113
NA,"ferred to previously, called the Disability",113
NA,Care Load Assessment (Child) Determina-,113
NA,tion. Instead of focusing solely on a child's,113
NA,"medical condition, this takes into account the",113
NA,care needs and is consistent with the way in,113
NA,which applications are assessed for carer,113
NA,allowance. It is also pleasing to see for the,113
NA,first time access to carer payment for a carer,113
NA,caring for a child up to the age of 16 who has,113
NA,a short-term or episodic illness. This may,113
NA,include mental illness conditions or medical,113
NA,conditions such as cancer and the many other,113
NA,illnesses that often beset children. This new,113
NA,instrument for determining eligibility will,113
NA,provide a test for assessing the functional,113
NA,behaviour and special care needs of a,113
NA,child. That includes a section to be com-,113
NA,"pleted by a treating health professional, a",113
NA,method of rating the child's care needs and,114
NA,method of providing a qualifying rating for,114
NA,the carer that takes account of the care,114
NA,"vided by the carer and the assessment, again,",114
NA,of the health professional.,114
NA,Item 10 of this bill inserts new sections,114
NA,along with changes to existing sections. It,114
NA,sets out the criteria for qualification for a,114
NA,"carer payment, and it includes some new",114
NA,items. Some of these are: a child with a se-,114
NA,vere disability or medical condition; two or,114
NA,"more children, each with a disability or",114
NA,medical condition; a disabled adult and one,114
NA,"or more children, each with a disability or",114
NA,medical condition; a child who has a termi-,114
NA,nal condition; exchange care of children;,114
NA,"short-term, episodic care of children; extenderstand",114
NA,sion of short-term or episodic care of chil-,114
NA,dren; disabled adult or disabled adult and,114
NA,dependent child; hospitalisation; and some,114
NA,short-term circumstances. In order to qualify,114
NA,"for these payments, the carer must provide",114
NA,constant care to a care receiver who has high,114
NA,"care needs, provide that care in the home of",114
NA,the care receiver and be an Australian resi-,114
NA,"dent. This section has not changed. However,",114
NA,there are new sections that take into account,114
NA,the impact of caring on a person's ability,114
NA,"undertake training, education, unpaid volun-",114
NA,tary work or paid employment.,114
NA,Limitations are currently in place on the,114
NA,number of hours a carer can work before,114
NA,they cease to provide constant care for the,114
NA,purpose of receiving carer payment. I think,114
NA,one of the toughest hurdles for carers is,114
NA,need to make a choice between continuing to,114
NA,work in the paid workforce and the need to,114
NA,"give full-time care. So often, the care",114
NA,are such that continuing to work in the paid,114
NA,"workforce, even on a part-time basis, is",114
NA,ply not a choice at all. And the limited op-,114
NA,tions for carers to participate in the paid,114
NA,workforce are further exacerbated by the,114
NA,severe shortage of places in day-care facilithen,114
NA,ties or carers who can come into the home to,114
NA,a relieve the principal carer. These are issues,114
NA,that I think need further airing and further,114
NA,procommunity discussion. Financial hardship is,114
NA,a major ongoing concern for many carers and,114
NA,the Who cares …? report actually recom-,114
NA,mends a significant increase in the base rate,114
NA,of carer payment.,114
NA,We have also asked that the Treasurer,114
NA,consider easing the tax burden on carers. The,114
NA,financial support received by carers can be,114
NA,quickly consumed by specialist medical ser-,114
NA,"vices, medication and/or equipment required",114
NA,"by those they care for-for example, buying",114
NA,"a wheelchair, adapting a house and the myr-",114
NA,iad other additional costs that carers must,114
NA,"fund. They soon add up, and it is easy to un-",114
NA,how rapidly financial stress can,114
NA,build up in families who find themselves in,114
NA,these circumstances.,114
NA,Financial isolation of carers is further ex-,114
NA,acerbated by employment limitations. Cur-,114
NA,"rently, there are significant disincentives for",114
NA,carers to earn supplementary income because,114
NA,any additional income reduces quite sharply,114
NA,the amount of income support they receive.,114
NA,Carers should be able to look to the future,114
NA,with at least some degree of certainty and,114
NA,"to maintain a reasonable standard of living, and",114
NA,this bill does go one step closer to providing,114
NA,greater certainty and better support.,114
NA,"In conclusion, the changes outlined in this",114
NA,bill will be very welcome to those caring for,114
NA,children with a disability or severe illness.,114
NA,"However, the whole issue of how we sup-",114
NA,"the port, value and treat our carers will need",114
NA,much more attention in the future. Many of,114
NA,the issues raised in the 2007 task force report,114
NA,needs commissioned by the Howard government,114
NA,"are again canvassed in the latest report, Who",114
NA,simcares …? As I said in my speech to the,114
NA,"House during the tabling of that report, if we",114
NA,"are to answer, ‘We care'-that is, those of us",114
NA,in this place responsible for the legislation-,114
NA,we need to confront the issues facing,114
NA,carers head on and match the rhetoric with,115
NA,reality. It will need all the political will we,115
NA,can muster to ensure a better future for carers,115
NA,"and those they care for, just as this legisla-",115
NA,tion will assist many in the community who,115
NA,provide extra care to children. I welcome the,115
NA,measures that are outlined in this bill. The,115
NA,changes recommended in the task force re-,115
NA,port will make a difference to the lives of,115
NA,carers now and into the future; in the mean-,115
NA,"time, these incremental changes are very",115

Dr SOUTHCOTT ,Boothby) (7.16,116
NA,pm)-I will not detain the House long in,116
NA,speaking to the Social Security and Other,116
NA,Legislation Amendment (Australian Appren-,116
NA,tices) Bill 2009. This bill seeks to exempt,116
NA,incentives paid to apprentices from treatment,116
NA,"as assessable income for taxation, social se-",116
NA,curity and veterans affairs purposes. These,116
NA,amendments will ensure that apprentices,116
NA,retain the entire amount of the financial in-,116
NA,centives paid to them. This will bring these,116
NA,new payments into line with the tax treat-,116
NA,ment afforded to previous incentives. It is a,116
NA,sensible measure that the opposition support.,116
NA,The first of these payments is the Skills,116
NA,for Sustainability for Australian Apprentices.,116
NA,This is a pilot program aimed at encouraging,116
NA,apprentices to undertake sustainability re-,116
NA,"lated training, by granting a payment of",116
NA,"$1,000 on completion of a required level of",116
NA,training. Discussions about sustainability,116
NA,related training have been around in this,116
NA,space for some time. We welcome this pilot,116
NA,program and we will be interested to see how,116
NA,it develops.,116
NA,The second payment is a rebadged pay-,116
NA,ment called the Tools for Your Trade incen-,116
NA,"tive. In fact, it is not even rebadged, because",116
NA,the old incentive was also called Tools for,116
NA,Your Trade. This measure will combine three,116
NA,existing incentives into one. Whilst the op-,116
NA,"position will be supporting the bill, we do",116
NA,"have a couple of issues here. First of all, the",116
NA,new incentive is not set to be payable until 1,116
NA,"January 2010, and there is an issue for ap-",116
NA,prentices and trainees who commence be-,116
NA,"tween 12 May 2009-that is, budget day-",116
NA,and 1 January 2010. There is a real question,116
NA,as to whether those people will be eligible,116
NA,BILL 2009 for the Tools for Your Trade incentive or,116
NA,whether they will fall through the gap in the,116
NA,merging of these three programs. So we do,116
NA,"have an issue in that, in moving from the old",116
NA,"Tools for Your Trade to a newer, simplified",116
NA,"incentive, a cohort of apprentices will miss",116
NA,out.,116
NA,The second issue is that a detailed exami-,116
NA,nation of the budget papers reveals a pea and,116
NA,thimble trick in the incentives being paid to,116
NA,"apprentices. Incredibly, at a time when the",116
NA,Australian economy needs to support em-,116
NA,"ployers, apprentices and people staying in",116
NA,"their apprenticeships, the Rudd government",116
NA,is taking a net $197 million out of the pock-,116
NA,ets of apprentices. This is classic sleight of,116
NA,hand: a number of things are going. The big-,116
NA,gest one is the apprenticeship training fee,116
NA,voucher. Labor had a policy to fund $800 for,116
NA,"out-of-pocket payments, which they an-",116
NA,nounced in December 2006. They have not,116
NA,"stuck by that, and in fact they have abolished",116
NA,"the apprenticeship training fee voucher,",116
NA,which was introduced in the 2007 budget. In,116
NA,their 2007 election policy document Skilling,116
NA,Australia for the future the Labor Party,116
NA,promised that all subsidies and payments to,116
NA,employers and apprentices would be re-,116
NA,tained. When you look at the fine print in the,116
NA,"budget, you can see that this is not extra",116
NA,money for apprentices. In the middle of what,116
NA,is leading to $188 billion in net debt and,117
NA,$315 billion in gross debt you can see that,117
NA,they have taken $197 million out of the,117
NA,pockets of apprentices.,117
NA,When we have a look at the latest figures,117
NA,from the NCVER on apprenticeships and,117
NA,trainees-and bear in mind that these figures,117
NA,are six months behind-we see that between,117
NA,the March 2008 quarter and the December,117
NA,2008 quarter apprenticeship commencements,117
NA,in traditional trades fell by 10 per cent. That,117
NA,is really before a lot of the impact came from,117
NA,the slowdown in the economy. As we have,117
NA,"heard, at the same time that we are seeing",117
NA,commencements falling the Rudd Labor,117
NA,government has abolished the apprenticeship,117
NA,"training fee vouchers, which provided up to",117
NA,"$1,000 to apprentices to help pay for their",117
NA,"training. As I said, apprentices who com-",117
NA,mence after 12 May 2009 will not have ac-,117
NA,cess to the Tools for Your Trade funding be-,117
NA,cause this has been put on hold until 1 Janu-,117
NA,ary 2010.,117
NA,The opposition have been vocal in their,117
NA,support for small business and apprentices,117
NA,during this economic downturn. As one ex-,117
NA,"ample of this, during the leader of the oppo-",117
NA,"sition's budget reply, we put up a proposal to",117
NA,bring forward the incentives for employers,117
NA,for traditional trades into the first two years,117
NA,of the apprenticeship. As the OECD noted in,117
NA,its review of vocational education and train-,117
NA,"ing in Australia and policy relating to it, most",117
NA,of the incentives for employers are actually,117
NA,back-ended towards the end of an appren-,117
NA,ticeship. We believe that it makes sense to,117
NA,bring them forward to a time in those first,117
NA,couple of years when the apprentice is not as,117
NA,productive and when the cost of hiring them,117
NA,is something that all businesses will take into,117
NA,account. Bringing forward those incentives,117
NA,for employers will also help to boost cash,117
NA,flows at a time when employers need this,117
NA,assistance most. The bill is a modest pro-,117
NA,posal designed to help employers retain their,117
NA,"apprentices and take on new apprentices,",117
NA,especially apprentices whose employment is,117
NA,in jeopardy. It provides a very good example,117
NA,"of how a modest, targeted proposal can be",117
NA,more effective than massive waves of ex-,117
NA,travagant cash splash-the $22 billion in,117
NA,"cash splash, the $42 billion in economic",117
NA,stimulus and other examples.,117
NA,The opposition will be supporting this leg-,117
NA,islation. We are disappointed that the Rudd,117
NA,government have taken $197 million from,117
NA,the pockets of apprentices. We are also dis-,117
NA,appointed that they were not able to time it a,117
NA,bit better. It seems that apprentices who,117
NA,commence between 12 May 2009 and 1,117
NA,January 2010 will miss out on the govern-,117
NA,"ment's Tools for Your Trade incentive, but",117
NA,we do support exempting these new incen-,117
NA,tives as assessable income for taxation.,117
Mr HAYES ,Werriwa) (7.24 pm)-The,117
NA,government is unapologetic when it comes to,117
NA,investing in nation building and investing in,117
NA,education and training. An investment in,117
NA,nation building through what we are doing in,117
NA,the development of infrastructure is just as,117
NA,important as what we are doing not only in,117
NA,the development of our skills now but also in,117
NA,"our requirements for the future. Therefore,",117
NA,the Social Security and Other Legislation,117
NA,Amendment (Australian Apprentices) Bill,117
NA,2009 takes certain very positive steps in rela-,117
NA,"tion to apprentices, particularly incentives",117
NA,for apprentices to remain in their apprentice-,117
NA,ships through to completion with a view to,117
NA,plying their trade productively and compre-,117
NA,hensively in our communities into the future.,117
NA,We on this side of the House are commit-,117
NA,ted to supporting jobs. No-one could chal-,117
NA,"lenge us on that, despite the fact that people",117
NA,on the other side of the House want to make,117
NA,mild protestations when it comes to our,117
NA,"spending on targeting jobs. But, when it",117
NA,"came down to it, I also saw the rush of peo-",117
NA,ple from the other side who wanted to get,117
NA,their faces on the camera in association with,118
NA,our investment in schools or what we are,118
NA,doing with social housing. The Minister for,118
NA,"Housing, Ms Plibersek, who is at the table at",118
NA,"the moment, accompanied me in my own",118
NA,"electorate, where we are doing significant",118
NA,"things with housing. As a matter of fact, in",118
NA,"my electorate, which has a very high propor-",118
NA,"tion of social housing, over $16 million has",118
NA,been allocated not to the construction of new,118
NA,premises but to the refurbishment of existing,118
NA,stock.,118
NA,One of the really decent things occurring,118
NA,out there at this stage is the partnerships,118
NA,are emerging. In a recent program targeted at,118
NA,"Macquarie Fields, one of the contractors that",118
NA,won social housing contracts is involved in a,118
NA,"partnership to train people. Around $154,000",118
NA,is going to go towards helping kids from,118
NA,challenged backgrounds to become involved,118
NA,with working in the construction industry,118
NA,and to ascertain whether they want to stay,118
NA,"there, with a view to leading them into trade",118
NA,apprenticeships in the building and construc-,118
NA,tion area. That is a wonderful thing to do. It,118
NA,is targeted at a group that may be at risk of,118
NA,falling through the cracks. This is something,118
NA,that this government are doing. Whilst we,118
NA,"are investing in creating jobs, we are not tak-",118
NA,ing our eye off the ball when it comes to,118
NA,looking into the future and looking at the,118
NA,skills that we can develop in all these kids,118
NA,into the future. That is why this bill is importraining,118
NA,"tant. As I said at the outset, this is about",118
NA,taining young people primarily when they,118
NA,"embark on an apprenticeship. Far too often,",118
NA,"unfortunately, people start these things and",118
NA,then let them go. There are many reasons for,118
NA,"that, I guess, but one of the things that this",118
NA,bill addresses is to put the incentive in there,118
NA,for targeted young people to complete their,118
NA,training and to fulfil the terms of their ap-,118
NA,prenticeships.,118
NA,This government are investing in a range,118
NA,of things. We are certainly investing heavily,118
NA,in roads in my electorate. I know that others,118
NA,"are heavily committed to ports and rail, but",118
NA,what we are doing through the school mod-,118
NA,"ernisation project, what we are doing in our",118
NA,local hospital and what we are doing in so-,118
NA,cial housing are very major investments. In,118
NA,"undertaking these investments, we are also",118
NA,investing in the skills development of our,118
NA,"people. From the opposition's perspective,",118
NA,after their 12 years in government it all got a,118
NA,bit hard to some extent for them. Mr Deputy,118
NA,"Speaker, you might recall that when the",118
NA,Howard government came to power they,118
NA,that took money out of the education system. We,118
NA,"found ourselves, after having about a billion",118
NA,dollars stripped out of education and while it,118
NA,"was raining bars of gold, as the saying goes,",118
NA,in a position where we did not have the,118
NA,"tradespeople to work in our mines, to move",118
NA,our coal and to export our iron ore.,118
NA,"As a matter of fact, one of my young sons",118
NA,found himself working for a period of time,118
NA,in Blackwater and then in Port Hedland-,118
NA,making significant amounts of money I,118
NA,"might add, in the process. But one of the",118
NA,problems there was that people were re-,118
NA,quired to come in on short-term overseas,118
NA,visas to provide the skills necessary for the,118
NA,productivity of the industries. That is an in-,118
NA,dictment of the planning that took place. It is,118
NA,"an indictment of those responsible, who al-",118
NA,lowed this to occur by not overseeing the,118
NA,of our young people to ensure that,118
NA,rewe had an adequate supply of apprentices,118
NA,moving through the system and therefore we,118
NA,had the tradespeople with the necessary,118
NA,skills necessary for the productivity those,118
NA,industries provide which contribute to the,118
NA,growth of this country.,118
NA,"To that end, the Deputy Prime Minister",118
NA,has only recently indicated that in terms of,118
NA,the tendering processes for the federal gov-,118
NA,"ernment and its infrastructure projects, pref-",118
NA,erence is being given to businesses that can,118
NA,demonstrate a commitment to training and,118
NA,employment of apprentices and trainees. As I,119
NA,indicated a little while earlier in terms of,119
NA,"social housing, that is precisely what the",119
NA,principal contractor is doing for those pro-,119
NA,"jects in my electorate of Werriwa, particu-",119
NA,"larly in areas of Claymore, Minto and Mac-",119
NA,quarie Fields. Young people are being trained,119
NA,in those areas.,119
NA,"As a matter of fact, it was very heartening",119
NA,the other day for me to be with the head of,119
NA,"the South West Sydney Institute of TAFE,",119
NA,"Mr Barry Peddle, who came to see me about",119
NA,the $10 million that the federal government,119
NA,has now allocated for a new building skills,119
NA,centre in Ingleburn. This new centre will be,119
NA,used for training young people in building,119
NA,and construction. Part of the reason for my,119
NA,electorate being the recipient of that fund-,119
NA,ing-hopefully it had something to do with,119
NA,some fruitful lobbying-was that where I,119
NA,live is the growth centre for Sydney. The,119
NA,south-west is where the next wave of devel-,119
NA,opment will occur.,119
NA,One of the things that follow from that,119
NA,will be a boom in housing and construction,119
NA,to facilitate the development. At the moment,119
NA,we do not have the number of tradespeople,119
NA,necessary to facilitate that. That is what this,119
NA,investment of $10 million is designed to do.,119
NA,It is to help provide those apprentices in the,119
NA,industries necessary to accommodate the,119
NA,south-west growth centre of Sydney. That is,119
NA,"something that we, in my neck of the woods,",119
NA,have a vested interest in. It will certainly,119
NA,give young people the opportunity to pursue,119
NA,"their desires, talents and skills in that",119
NA,tion.,119
NA,To some extent I will continue my speech,119
NA,with my personal involvement in apprentice-,119
NA,ships. Whilst my daughter went on to univer-,119
NA,"sity and became a high school teacher, both",119
NA,my sons decided that university was not for,119
NA,them. One of the boys became a builder-,119
NA,carpenter and the other boy-after an ap-,119
NA,prenticeship through the National Electrical,119
NA,"the Contractors Association, a group training",119
NA,body-became an electrician. That has,119
NA,opened up a whole range of opportunities for,119
NA,them over the years. To some extent one of,119
NA,"the boys has moved in and out of his calling,",119
NA,but because he successfully completed an,119
NA,apprenticeship he always had something to,119
NA,"fall back on. As the boys describe it, they go",119
NA,‘back on tools'. That is pretty helpful.,119
NA,"My other son, the electrician, has been",119
NA,around. He is the fella who has been to Port,119
NA,Hedland and Blackwater and worked in the,119
NA,mines and done all those things. He has,119
NA,"come back and, because of the stimulus",119
NA,"package, he is now doing work locally for",119
NA,"the first time ever, as he has put it to me. He",119
NA,is working locally refurbishing Housing,119
NA,NSW stock in our local area. He set up his,119
NA,own little private company and he is out,119
NA,there subbing and doing all those sorts of,119
NA,"things. So, good luck to them!",119
NA,But it is not just my boys-I am talking,119
NA,about my direct experience-I know their,119
NA,friends are out there doing similar things. As,119
NA,"a matter of fact, about nine weeks ago I held",119
NA,a forum in my electorate. I invited all the,119
NA,"businesses, through the chambers of com-",119
NA,merce et cetera to find those who had an in-,119
NA,terest in picking up work that could possibly,119
NA,flow from the stimulus package targeted at,119
NA,education-the schools projects-and social,119
NA,"housing. In my electorate, which is in outer-",119
NA,"metropolitan Sydney, I can report to you that",119
NA,we had 220 people turn up from local busi-,119
NA,"direcnesses, wanting to know how they could ex-",119
NA,press their interest in being involved in these,119
NA,matters. One of the key things I discovered,119
NA,when listening to a number of the people,119
NA,there was that they wanted some indication,119
NA,of how the tendering process would operate.,119
NA,They wanted to know what skills they would,119
NA,need. A few of them wanted to know how,119
NA,many apprentices they would need to put on.,119
NA,Another one wanted to know where the ap-,119
NA,"prentices would undertake that training, be-",120
NA,cause they wanted the apprentices working at,120
NA,the moment. They were pretty heartened to,120
NA,hear about the establishment of the new,120
NA,"TAFE facility in Ingleburn. It will target,",120
NA,"ostensibly, the building and construction",120
NA,trades. That is certainly going to help the,120
NA,numbers of young people coming into this,120
NA,industry. It was important for those people,120
NA,"who attended my forum to learn, with some",120
NA,"surety, about the numbers of jobs that are",120
NA,likely to be created.,120
NA,I know that an electorate office out there,120
NA,should not become an employment facility,120
NA,but my office has been inundated with peo-,120
NA,ple ringing up and wanting to know how to,120
NA,get their names on the list and how to ex-,120
NA,press an interest in jobs. We refer them to,120
NA,Housing NSW and to the New South Wales,120
NA,Department of Education and Training.,120
NA,There is now an endless stream of people,120
NA,who are trying to get involved-from estab-,120
NA,lished companies through to people such as,120
NA,my young fella who wants to set up his own,120
NA,business so that he can participate in the jobs,120
NA,created by this round of stimulus package,120
NA,"activity. And that sort of thing is occurring,",120
NA,"would say, in every electorate.",120
NA,Another of our very successful businesses,120
NA,in Ingleburn is Broens engineering. I knew,120
NA,Carlos Broens when he started this company,120
NA,as a toolmaker. He and his brother were the,120
NA,whole business. It now employs around 300,120
NA,"people. In outer metropolitan Sydney, that is",120
NA,"a large employer. Last year, he took on 34",120
NA,apprentices. He actually has a TAFE facility,120
NA,on his site now so that young apprentices can,120
NA,be trained with the equipment the business,120
NA,"uses. He has been preselected, I understand,",120
NA,"for contracts for Boeing, and he is doing",120
NA,"work for BMW, GMH and Mercedes. This is",120
NA,a success story of our area. From the back,120
NA,"blocks of Sydney, he is now exporting to",120
NA,world markets. His site certainly has signifi-,120
NA,cant engineering credibility.,120
NA,"What Carlos always maintains, and what",120
NA,"distinguishes his approach, is his commit-",120
NA,"ment to training. He spearheaded Austool, a",120
NA,body which attracted some government,120
NA,"funds, with a view to targeting skills devel-",120
NA,opment in the toolmaking sector. Unfortu-,120
NA,"nately, that scheme did not go all that well,",120
NA,and he became discouraged with the process.,120
NA,That was when he started TAFE visiting his,120
NA,premises-they are now working from his,120
NA,premises. He has been instrumental in TAFE,120
NA,reinjecting itself in Ingleburn-which is a,120
NA,growing industrial estate of the south-west of,120
NA,Sydney-with a view to targeting young ap-,120
NA,prentices there and providing opportunities,120
NA,for employers. Young people are able to be,120
NA,trained locally as opposed to having to be,120
NA,carted off to the various TAFE colleges de-,120
NA,pending on their specialties. We are now see-,120
NA,ing opportunities for companies to work in,120
NA,"conjunction, hand in hand, with some of",120
NA,these skills providers. The use that is now,120
NA,"being made of TAFE, and TAFE facilities",120
NA,working in partnership with the individual to,120
NA,"deliver these trade developments, is now",120
NA,paying significant dividends throughout the,120
NA,I industrial areas of my electorate.,120
NA,This bill will do a number of things which,120
NA,will support young people in their trades. It,120
NA,will certainly support retention of appren-,120
NA,tices. The bill will amend the Income Tax,120
NA,"Assessment Act 1997, the Social Security",120
NA,Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act,120
NA,1986 to exempt the value of payments made,120
NA,under the Skills for Sustainability for Austra-,120
NA,"lian Apprentices and Tools For Your Trade,",120
NA,under the Australian Apprenticeships Incen-,120
NA,"tives Program, from treatment as assessable",120
NA,income for income tax purposes and from the,120
NA,income test for benefits under social security,120
NA,and veterans' affairs legislation.,120
NA,Skills for Sustainability for Australian,120
NA,Apprentices is a pilot program within the,120
NA,Skills for the Carbon Challenge initiative.,120
NA,This initiative came out of the 2020 Summit,120
NA,and aims to accelerate the response to cli-,121
NA,mate change by industry and the tertiary,121
NA,education sector. To encourage apprentice-,121
NA,ships to undertake sustainability related,121
NA,"training, the payment of $1,000 will be pro-",121
NA,vided to eligible apprentices who have suc-,121
NA,cessfully completed the required level of,121
NA,training to provide them with skills in sus-,121
NA,tainability and environmentally sustainable,121
NA,work practices.,121
NA,The enhanced Tools For Your Trade pay-,121
NA,ment combines and extends three existing,121
NA,support initiatives-the Tools For Your Trade,121
NA,"voucher, the apprenticeship wage top-up and",121
NA,the Commonwealth trade learning scholar-,121
NA,ship-in the one new Tools For Your Trade,121
NA,payment under the Australian Apprentice-,121
NA,ships Incentives Program. The new payment,121
NA,comprises five separate cash payments total-,121
NA,"ling $3,800 paid over the life of the appren-",121
NA,ticeship to apprentices in selected trade oc-,121
NA,"cupations, agricultural occupations and, if in",121
NA,"rural and regional locations, horticultural",121
NA,occupations.,121
NA,"The new arrangements, importantly, re-",121
NA,duce the administrative burden for employers,121
NA,"of apprentices, broaden eligibility criteria,",121
NA,"benefiting more apprentices, and ensure that",121
NA,apprentices in skills shortage trades are,121
NA,gible for the same level of government sup-,121
NA,port regardless of age and employer size. The,121
NA,amendments in the bill will ensure that,121
NA,ble apprentices receive the full benefit,121
NA,payments made under the two new programs,121
NA,and are consistent with the tax treatment of,121
NA,previous programs that have paid personal,121
NA,benefits to apprentices.,121
NA,I welcome these measures as they apply,121
NA,through my electorate. I will always play a,121
NA,role in advocating proper and sustainable,121
NA,trade based training. It is something that we,121
NA,as a nation have prided ourselves on in the,121
NA,past and it is something that over the past 10,121
NA,or 12 years we have allowed to escape. If we,121
NA,are serious about building our economy for,121
NA,"the future, this is something we need to keep",121
NA,our eye on. I welcome this. I think it is good,121
NA,for young people. It is a great measure to,121
NA,encourage the retention of apprentices and it,121
NA,is very good for businesses such as Broens,121
NA,engineering.,121
NA,This is what we can do as a nation. It is,121
NA,important that we give suitable attention to,121
NA,trade based training and trade development.,121
NA,It worked very effectively for my young fel-,121
NA,"las. As I said, they have all been able to go",121
NA,"on and do a range of different jobs, but at",121
NA,some stage when it suits them they return the,121
NA,tools. These are skills that they will maintain,121
NA,for life. Their skills passport will enable,121
NA,them to participate in building our economy,121
NA,in the future.,121
Mr TUCKEY ,O'Connor) (7.44 pm)-,121
NA,"On the face of it, the Social Security and",121
NA,Other Legislation Amendment (Australian,121
NA,Apprentices) Bill 2009 is of a fairly minor,121
NA,nature but is of an administrative type and,121
NA,consequently brings together certain pay-,121
NA,"ments. As frequently occurs over time, gov-",121
NA,ernments make a variety of initiatives and it,121
NA,becomes obvious that they should be amal-,121
NA,gamated into a single grant or whatever. It,121
NA,"eli- also, I am pleased to say, makes sure that",121
NA,such grants as are given in these circum-,121
NA,stances are not subject to the income tax that,121
NA,eligi- would otherwise apply to the income of,121
NA,"of the young people, apprentices and others. I",121
NA,should not use the words ‘young people'. An,121
NA,apprenticeship now is not only a project for,121
NA,the young; it is a project for mature persons,121
NA,who seek to improve themselves from hav-,121
NA,ing basic employment skills in areas of de-,121
NA,clining employment. I think all congratula-,121
NA,tions are due to those who do make that,121
NA,"choice, because it is quite difficult.",121
NA,"Nevertheless, whilst it is just a trial pro-",121
NA,"gram, the Skills for Sustainability for Austra-",121
NA,lian Apprentices is of great interest to me. I,121
NA,think it is a great idea. I think it is a pity,122
NA,"in the second reading speech, the minister",122
NA,did not bother to tell us where these sorts of,122
NA,opportunities might exist in the future. What,122
NA,you have to be to participate in the govern-,122
NA,ment's program of carbon pollution reduc-,122
NA,tion is of course a screen jockey. You have to,122
NA,"be an employee of a hedge fund or a bank, or",122
NA,someone else who is going to try and re-,122
NA,"establish your respectability, having de-",122
NA,stroyed the world economy on your last at-,122
NA,tempt. And you are going to be given the,122
NA,opportunity to gamble on certificates to pol-,122
NA,lute. I thought that was a pretty bad place to,122
NA,start in addressing a problem that appears to,122
NA,"be universal, throughout the globe, where",122
NA,Australia could be a contributor in providing,122
NA,the world with the technology that might,122
NA,work. The technology that the world has,122
NA,provided to date will not work in any signifi-,122
NA,"cant fashion, be it wind generation, solar",122
NA,"power or any of those things, simply because",122
NA,"they lack the substance or, if you like, the",122
NA,capacity to work.,122
NA,But there are opportunities within the pre-,122
NA,"sent technology, and one might wonder if the",122
NA,"minister, in coming up with this particular",122
NA,"program, might have thought it a good idea",122
NA,to have a special class in the management of,122
NA,high-voltage DC transmission systems.,122
NA,"HVDC, as we know it, is most notable, but",122
NA,"not recognised by many, as the means of",122
NA,transmitting electricity across Bass Strait. It,122
NA,had to be chosen on that occasion simply,122
NA,because you could not have a series of posts,122
NA,"along the way with a transformer, which is a",122
NA,necessary energy-consuming component of,122
NA,"high-voltage AC transmission, on which the",122
NA,Australian system relies with only a couple,122
NA,of exceptions. And the great advantage of,122
NA,high-voltage DC transmission is that you can,122
NA,shift electrical energy over huge distances.,122
NA,The Chinese are presently building a,122
NA,"2,000-kilometre transmission line-being",122
NA,"constructed, I might add, by people with",122
NA,"that, whom I have significant contact in this arena",122
NA,"because I believe I have to learn, as other",122
NA,parliamentarians in this place do not. The,122
NA,"fact is that ABB, as it is now known-it was",122
NA,once Asea Brown Boveri-is building that,122
NA,line for the Chinese. The Europeans are flat,122
NA,out utilising this technology because it saves,122
NA,emissions just by being in existence. It does,122
NA,not require a great deal of inventiveness. It,122
NA,does not require hundreds of billions of dol-,122
NA,"lars, as might be required in proving up car-",122
NA,"bon capture and sequestration, which I have",122
NA,never seen as a logical response to the prob-,122
NA,"lem because it just says, ‘We'll make the",122
NA,problem go away'.,122
NA,In the utilisation of high-voltage DC,122
NA,"transmission, however, you reduce the",122
NA,"amount of energy lost, particularly over long",122
NA,distances. And it can compete with gas pipe-,122
NA,lines. Gas pipelines are very energy ineffi-,122
NA,cient. The one that delivers gas from the Pil-,122
NA,bara to the City of Perth uses in its compres-,122
NA,sors the power equivalent to one of the coal-,122
NA,fired power stations that service the state-,122
NA,"250 megawatts. Yet, if the electricity that is",122
NA,generated from that pipeline when it gets to,122
NA,Perth was in fact generated at the well-head,122
NA,"end-on the beach, if you like, in the case of",122
NA,offshore gas reserves-and sent down on,122
NA,"HVDC, you would lose significantly less",122
NA,energy and you would have consequent im-,122
NA,provement in emissions.,122
NA,I wonder how many apprentices are doing,122
NA,their time in that technology. It is a pity that,122
NA,there was not some sort of list in the explana-,122
NA,tory memorandum or somewhere else which,122
NA,tells us where this smart alec idea is going to,122
NA,work. There are huge opportunities in the,122
NA,reform of energy generation-and the evi-,122
NA,dence is all there. It is not new technology;,122
NA,"we do not have to invent it, although we",122
NA,"could leverage off, from a technological ba-",122
NA,"sis, some of the generating opportunities that",122
NA,"would follow an adequate HVDC system,",122
NA,which in my mind ought to be now under,122
NA,construction as the appropriate stimulus,123
NA,package instead of wasting money as is be-,123
NA,ing done at the moment on school facilities,123
NA,"that are unnecessary in many cases, in build-",123
NA,ing passenger railways that will lose money,123
NA,forever and-I will get the minister at the,123
NA,"table, the Minister for Housing, to put her",123
NA,head up when I say this-in public housing,123
NA,that will cost money for ever and ever there-,123
NA,after. I noted the other day that the Western,123
NA,Australian parliament has had to budget $8,123
NA,million simply to fix up the houses that have,123
NA,been trashed under their responsibility at the,123
NA,moment.,123
NA,"But the reality is that, if apprentices are",123
NA,"going to be given $1,000, as this act pro-",123
NA,"vides, for the purpose of gaining skills in",123
NA,"sustainability, I think it would be a good idea",123
NA,if the parliament gave it some privileges.,123
NA,"But, as I said, this government has stepped",123
NA,"out to build public housing, passenger rail-",123
NA,ways and of course spread a mere $24 billion,123
NA,"in cash around, but if it had chosen to invest",123
NA,that sort of money in sustainable energy ini-,123
NA,tiatives that are available and would easily fit,123
NA,"within those costs, they would not have this",123
NA,procession of industry groups coming along,123
NA,"and saying, ‘Please don't drive us out of the",123
NA,"country with an emissions trading scheme,'",123
NA,which at the end will give no guarantee of,123
NA,reducing emissions. It is in fact a process of,123
NA,selling certificates to pollute. The question,123
NA,to how much your business or your consum-,123
NA,ers can bear of that cost will decide what,123
NA,reductions might follow.,123
NA,"We are talking about a good idea here,",123
NA,which is to get apprentices dealing in new,123
NA,technology. That might be hydrogen fuel cell,123
NA,"technology, which would be a great opportu-",123
NA,nity for young people. It is a technology that,123
NA,"will happen, as will the plug-in electric car",123
NA,and the technology associated with lithium,123
NA,ion batteries and all other things that will be,123
NA,associated with that process. The reality is,123
NA,"that what the government is doing, notwith-",123
NA,standing the offering of the minister for re-,123
NA,sources today-I had to watch him on televi-,123
NA,sion because you are not allowed to make,123
NA,jokes in this place any more!-when he,123
NA,talked about this massive investment in sus-,123
NA,"tainability, is peanuts. The government can-",123
NA,not make a major contribution of less than,123
NA,$10 billion. An investment of that amount,123
NA,would be a starting point and it could deliver,123
NA,"a 10 or 15 per cent long-term, permanent",123
NA,reduction in emissions without sending alu-,123
NA,minium smelters et cetera to the wall. Other,123
NA,"countries, and particularly China, are taking",123
NA,this option. Their centralised bureaucratic,123
NA,structure will not lead to the sort of market,123
NA,solution that the Rudd government believes,123
NA,will drive Australian business to save the,123
NA,world. They are investing in renewables or,123
NA,non-emitting technology such as nuclear,123
NA,power. They have 25 such projects on the,123
NA,drawing board or under construction as we,123
NA,"speak. Even the Iranians, for whatever rea-",123
NA,"son, are building a nuclear power station,",123
NA,presumably so that they can sell more oil!,123
NA,"Australia, with its tidal energy resource,",123
NA,has one of the biggest renewable energy re-,123
NA,"sources in the world, according to the World",123
NA,Energy Council. A body associated with Ox-,123
NA,ford University can come out here and tell us,123
NA,what we have on a world table and you never,123
NA,"hear a bleep from this government, which",123
NA,as says that it wants to go to Copenhagen and,123
NA,lead the world in a response to the issues of,123
NA,carbon emissions and climate change.,123
NA,We have two choices as a nation. I can tell,123
NA,you that we will be giving apprentices,123
NA,"$1,000 to get sustainability skills, but if in",123
NA,fact the whole system is going to be driven,123
NA,by screen jockeys-apparently they will all,123
NA,"live in Sydney, because New South Wales",123
NA,government ministers are salivating over the,123
NA,profits that will accrue to Sydney arising,123
NA,from an emissions trading scheme. If some-,123
NA,"one takes a profit out of the trading concept,",123
NA,that is an extra cost that somebody else has,123
NA,to pay. Yet we are talking here today of what,124
NA,apprentices might do. We will not have elec-,124
NA,"tric cars or hydrogen fuel cell cars, which in",124
NA,fact still require an electricity input to elecdifferent,124
NA,"trolyse the water to produce hydrogen, unless",124
NA,we produce more electricity. So apprentices,124
NA,need to learn how better to produce renew-,124
NA,"able electricity at the gigawatt level, as could",124
NA,occur in the Kimberleys. The technology,124
NA,associated with the conversions for high-,124
NA,voltage DC transmission-and these things,124
NA,only cost $250 million a pop-is the sort of,124
NA,opportunity that the minister should have,124
NA,talked about in his second reading speech.,124
NA,The speech should have referred to directing,124
NA,young people to these opportunities and giv-,124
NA,"ing them the opportunity to earn $1,000 or",124
NA,more.,124
NA,But of course those projects are not on the,124
NA,drawing board. There is no opportunity for,124
NA,young apprentices to learn about that be-,124
NA,cause this government does not believe in it.,124
NA,The government's ETS provides more oppor-,124
NA,"tunities for repairers of desktop computers,",124
NA,because that is what the scheme is all about.,124
NA,It is not about creating opportunities in tech-,124
NA,nology. And the lousy few hundred million,124
NA,dollars that the minister boasted about today,124
NA,will simply not deliver anything like that,124
NA,needed from government. If the money that,124
NA,was put into public housing was put into an,124
NA,initiative like that a lot of people would not,124
NA,need public housing because their jobs,124
NA,"would not be at risk, as is patently obvious",124
NA,they will be when you start to jack up the,124
NA,competitive costs of local industries such as,124
NA,"iron, steel and aluminium, where the work-",124
NA,force is often filled with loyal Labor votes-,124
NA,but that does not seem to worry this govern-,124
NA,ment. Maybe the intelligentsia will re-elect,124
NA,them.,124
NA,Concerning sustainability for apprentices,124
NA,"learning, while there are no projects and",124
NA,while projects are not necessarily going to,124
NA,come from industry because they have been,124
NA,taxed to a point where they have no money,124
NA,left-and that is the theory behind ETS; you,124
NA,make things so costly that people will make,124
NA,expenditure choices. They will have,124
NA,"no money and, as things stand, they will in",124
NA,fact be competing with the government to,124
NA,borrow money. We touched on this in ques-,124
NA,tion time today but I did not think the Treas-,124
NA,urer had much of an idea of what he was,124
NA,talking about and nor did the Prime Minister,124
NA,when quoting the interest rate spreads-you,124
NA,"cannot borrow the money in Australia, so",124
NA,"what is the point. Anyway, coming back to",124
NA,"the issue, the Skills for Sustainability Austra-",124
NA,lian apprentices grant is a sensible initiative.,124
NA,"Outside some technical adjustments, the",124
NA,Skills for Sustainability Australian appren-,124
NA,tices grant is the thing that should be point-,124
NA,ing the way for young people in terms of,124
NA,opportunity but it is lacking in that it does,124
NA,not tell the kids what it happens to be.,124
NA,"As I said, at the moment the only proposi-",124
NA,tion before this parliament is a screen,124
NA,jockey's opportunity because that is what an,124
NA,ETS is. An ETS is a process of licensing,124
NA,people to pollute and trying to drive them,124
NA,into some sort of reduced emissions position,124
NA,by making it too expensive to stay where,124
NA,they are. But it ignores the option of leaving,124
NA,Australia completely or passing the cost on,124
NA,"downstream, as can occur in electricity gen-",124
NA,eration where there is a captive consumer,124
NA,market. So what are the kids going to learn,124
NA,"there? You should say to them, ‘Here are the",124
NA,opportunities.' One of the reasons for the,124
NA,lack of opportunities is that the government,124
NA,are not investing in saws or planing units or,124
NA,"anything like that. Instead, they have taken",124
NA,all the basic investments of sustainability-,124
NA,none of them have a technological peak-,124
NA,when that same money could have been put,124
NA,into achieving up to a 40 per cent reduction,124
NA,in emissions trading for Australia and would,124
NA,have led the way for apprentices to have,124
NA,genuine sustainability skills.,124
NA,NA,125
NA,commend the former speaker for his contri-,125
NA,bution to the debate. I too rise in support of,125
NA,the Social Security and Other Legislation,125
NA,Amendment (Australian Apprentices) Bill,125
NA,2009. This bill is about a very minor,125
NA,amendment to various acts but it will make a,125
NA,huge difference for thousands of apprentices,125
NA,throughout the country. Being an apprentice,125
NA,is not something that I have experienced in,125
NA,"my varied careers. But I remember that,",125
NA,"when I was in year 7, I basically decided that",125
NA,I wanted to become an apprentice butcher,125
NA,and leave school. That was not so much,125
NA,about a love of the butchering industry but,125
NA,more because the nun who taught me at the,125
NA,time terrified me. I thought that the best,125
NA,"tion was to join my family's profession,",125
NA,which is the meat trade. My grandfather was,125
NA,"a butcher and so were my father, my uncle",125
NA,"and two of my brothers, so I thought that that",125
NA,"was the way to go. As it turned out, I did not",125
NA,go that way. I know that there are a couple of,125
NA,meatworkers in the parliament and they,125
NA,make a contribution. I did not go down the,125
NA,route of an apprenticeship and instead ended,125
NA,up being a teacher and the like.,125
NA,Apprentices are a very important section,125
NA,of the community and one that we definitely,125
NA,need to look after as much as possible. The,125
NA,legislation before the House amends the In-,125
NA,"come Tax Assessment Act 1997, the Social",125
NA,Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitle-,125
NA,ments Act 1986 to ensure that the Skills for,125
NA,Sustainability and Tools for Your Trade,125
NA,payments made to apprentices are not as-,125
NA,sessable income for tax purposes. This is,125
NA,quite significant legislation for apprentices.,125
NA,It is quite significant in the current economic,125
NA,climate that it got past Treasurer Swan as,125
NA,"well, I guess. But he understands the benefits",125
NA,of looking after these skills and making sure,125
NA,"that they are nurtured and developed, espe-",125
NA,cially in tough economic times. These legis-,125
NA,lative changes will ensure that the appren-,125
NA,tices and the community get the full benefit,125
NA,of these two programs by them not being,125
NA,assessable income for tax purposes.,125
NA,"There are about 400,000 apprentices in",125
NA,training around the country. I will declare a,125
NA,possible conflict of interest here. My,125
NA,"nephew, Joel Perrett, is an apprentice and",125
NA,possibly might benefit from this enhance-,125
NA,ment. I will not declare every single member,125
NA,of my family who has been an apprentice in,125
NA,"the past, but for the sake of clarity and in",125
NA,order to be honest and respectable I will de-,125
NA,clare that possible conflict of interest-and,125
NA,so that Joel has the thrill of being named in,125
NA,parliament. He works in the building indus-,125
NA,"try, with cranes in particular. One of my",125
NA,op- other brothers works in the crane industry.,125
NA,"Obviously, they are particularly sensitive to",125
NA,the swings and roundabouts of the economic,125
NA,climate. They are based down on the Gold,125
NA,Coast and they are probably doing work in,125
NA,the electorate of the good member for Mon-,125
NA,"crieff, where a lot of high-rise construction is",125
NA,taking place. So I declare that possible con-,125
NA,flict of interest.,125
NA,"These apprentices, these men and",125
NA,women-and I was going to say young men,125
NA,"and women, but I know that that is not nec-",125
NA,essarily the case anymore; people are going,125
NA,back as mature age apprentices nowadays-,125
NA,are learning the skills and know-how through,125
NA,on-the-job experience to ensure that we have,125
NA,the skills that we need to carry Australia,125
NA,forward into the future. It is particularly im-,125
NA,portant that we do this when times are tough,125
NA,so that we are ready to come out of the,125
NA,trough. We must be ready for that. People,125
NA,batten down the hatches and markets tighten,125
NA,up when economic circumstances deterio-,125
NA,"rate, so it is important that the government",125
NA,does what it can to make sure that people are,125
NA,"primed, ready and trained-retrained if nec-",125
NA,essary-so as to go into overdrive when the,125
NA,market turns around. I am sure that all those,125
NA,in the House would take heart from the eco-,125
NA,nomic outlook figures that we have seen over,126
NA,the last few weeks. There would not be any-,126
NA,one partaking of dole queue schadenfreude,126
NA,"and hoping for things to go bad. Instead, I",126
NA,am sure that we all want the best for Austra-,126
NA,lia.,126
NA,The Skills for Sustainability program for,126
NA,Australian apprentices is a great initiative to,126
NA,encourage apprentices to complete the sus-,126
NA,tainability related training. They receive,126
NA,"$1,000 once they have successfully com-",126
NA,pleted the required level of training. Obvi-,126
NA,"ously, $1,000 is not as much today as it was",126
NA,when I was contemplating going into the,126
NA,"butchering trade in 1977, but $1,000 is still",126
NA,quite significant and a great incentive.,126
NA,Australian workplaces are crying out for,126
NA,people with training in environmentally sus-,126
NA,"tainable work practices, and the Skills for",126
NA,Sustainability payment will provide an added,126
NA,incentive to apprentices who complete their,126
NA,training in this area. It will also give them a,126
NA,head start when it comes time to find a job.,126
NA,Those who are equipped to meet the sustain-,126
NA,ability challenges that they might face on the,126
NA,job will obviously be ahead of the pack. This,126
NA,skill will become much more of a factor for,126
NA,employers when they determine who will,126
NA,become their employees. As Australia transi-,126
NA,tions slowly but surely and inevitably to a,126
NA,low carbon economy-I say this irrespective,126
NA,of what goes on in the red chamber-,126
NA,consumers will increasingly want outcomes,126
NA,that are good for the environment. The ap-,126
NA,prentices who benefit from these programs,126
NA,will be well equipped and ready to deliver.,126
NA,"Incidentally, the idea of the Skills for",126
NA,tainability program came out of the Australia,126
NA,2020 Summit convened by the Prime Minis-,126
NA,ter in April 2008 and held in this building.,126
NA,This is further evidence that politicians do,126
NA,not have all the bright ideas and it also shows,126
NA,that this government is prepared to listen to,126
NA,good ideas no matter where they come from.,126
NA,"Obviously, there are many people who feel",126
NA,"that, if we just listen to taxi drivers, we could",126
NA,solve all of the world's problems pretty,126
NA,quickly. But the 2020 Summit went beyond,126
NA,just taxi drivers; it engaged lots of different,126
NA,people from lots of different sections within,126
NA,our community and some great ideas flowed,126
NA,from that.,126
NA,In the weeks leading up to the national,126
NA,"2020 Summit, I held a community forum in",126
NA,my electorate in conjunction with Griffith,126
NA,"University and, in particular, the Nathan",126
NA,campus. More than 400 people filled the,126
NA,auditorium at Griffith University. We shared,126
NA,a few hours of robust debate and information,126
NA,sharing. There are certainly some very pas-,126
NA,sionate people with some very firmly held,126
NA,beliefs. It was a fantastic experience and it,126
NA,was important for me as the new local mem-,126
NA,ber to be informed about the range of views,126
NA,"in my community-although, there were",126
NA,times when I wished that the range of views,126
NA,had not been quite as broad as was presented.,126
NA,"But, nevertheless, it was great for the com-",126
NA,"munity to be heard, and that is why I, in",126
NA,"partnership with Griffith university, will be",126
NA,holding a Southside summit on 22 August,126
NA,this year. If the member for Moncrieff wants,126
NA,"to put that date in his diary, he is more than",126
NA,welcome to attend. I would be more than,126
NA,happy to have him address a particular sec-,126
NA,tion of the community. A range of topics,126
NA,"will be up for discussion, and I am sure that",126
NA,we will hear more great ideas like the Skills,126
NA,for Sustainability program.,126
NA,"As I mentioned earlier, the other payment",126
NA,Susproposed in this legislation is Tools For Your,126
NA,Trade. This new payment combines and ex-,126
NA,tends three programs previously offered to,126
NA,Australian apprentices to support them in,126
NA,undertaking apprenticeships in areas of na-,126
NA,tional skills shortage. The Tools For Your,126
NA,Trade payment includes five separate cash,126
NA,"payments, totalling $3,800 over the life of an",126
NA,apprenticeship. They are not insignificant,126
NA,"amounts of cash, especially for an appren-",127
NA,tice. This new payment will help more ap-,127
NA,prentices make life easier for employers and,127
NA,it will also ensure that Australian apprentices,127
NA,in areas of skills shortage are eligible for the,127
NA,"same level of support. Importantly, this bill",127
NA,ensures that payments made to apprentices,127
NA,under these programs will be tax exempt. I,127
NA,understand this is in line with the tax treat-,127
NA,ment of other programs that have made simi-,127
NA,lar payments to apprentices.,127
NA,The two programs are worth about $700,127
NA,million over four years. So we are not talking,127
NA,about just a few dollars or a token gesture;,127
NA,this is significant cash on the table to ensure,127
NA,"that our apprentices, be they young, old or",127
NA,"mature, are able to complete their training",127
NA,with as much support as possible from the,127
NA,government. I am sure that everyone can see,127
NA,the benefits of the programs in encouraging,127
NA,apprentices to undertake training in areas of,127
NA,workforce shortage and sustainability. Any,127
NA,investment that we can pump into meeting,127
NA,skills shortages and equipping people for the,127
NA,climate change jobs of the future is money,127
NA,well spent as far as I am concerned.,127
NA,"On a related note, earlier this year I was",127
NA,pleased to meet 10 young people working on,127
NA,the Green Corps project to improve water,127
NA,quality and protect the local flora and fauna,127
NA,in the Rocky Water Holes Creek area of the,127
NA,Oxley Creek catchment in my electorate.,127
NA,"Unfortunately, the Rocky Water Holes Creek",127
NA,"area floods fairly regularly, and that has a",127
NA,significant impact on the suburbs of Rocklea,127
NA,and Salisbury. It was great to go along and,127
NA,meet the guys who were working on the,127
NA,Green Corps project. They were cleaning up,127
NA,the river bank around the construction train-,127
NA,ing centre and attempting to move rubbish,127
NA,from lantana. It was amazing to see the filth,127
NA,and rubbish that had accumulated there over,127
NA,"the last 20, 30, 40 or 50 years. I took some",127
NA,photographs of these young people and have,127
NA,included them in a newsletter.,127
NA,Mr Gray interjecting-,127
NA,NA,127
NA,ple tomorrow.,127
NA,Mr Gray-I would appreciate that.,127
NA,NA,127
NA,people had not necessarily been the most,127
NA,successful at school. A couple of them had,127
NA,made a decision to go into an environmental,127
NA,job because that is what they had always,127
NA,wanted to do. Some were being trained up so,127
NA,that they could spend a year backpacking,127
NA,overseas and perhaps use their green skills in,127
NA,other parts of the world that may be a little,127
NA,more embracing of legislation like the Car-,127
NA,bon Pollution Reduction Scheme. It was a,127
NA,great opportunity to meet these young guys,127
NA,"working on the Green Corps, and they",127
NA,seemed to be picking up a lot of skills. Obvi-,127
NA,"ously, things have changed a bit in terms of",127
NA,the knowledge that they need. They now,127
NA,have to know how to use personal protective,127
NA,equipment and different types of machines,127
NA,"such as brush-cutters and the like, which",127
NA,seemed incredibly dangerous. These young,127
NA,people said that they would not let me touch,127
NA,"any of the brush-cutters, which was probably",127
NA,a wise decision. This is a great training op-,127
NA,portunity and experience for young job seek-,127
NA,"ers, and these young people are doing a great",127
NA,job in helping to regenerate local native plant,127
NA,"species through weeding, planting and water",127
NA,quality monitoring.,127
NA,These programs that are before the House,127
NA,will help ease the financial burden for ap-,127
NA,prentices and encourage more into training,127
NA,areas of sustainability and skill shortages.,127
NA,Why are we doing this? We are doing this,127
NA,because the government understands that a,127
NA,carbon restrained economy is all but upon us.,127
NA,If you doorknock any household in my elec-,127
NA,"torate of Moreton, I am sure two out of three",127
NA,would say they understand that something,127
NA,has to be done about climate change. You,127
NA,occasionally get the ill-informed people who,127
NA,think that the world's global warming prob-,128
NA,lems were changed last year when the Kyoto,128
NA,"protocol was signed, but most understand",128
NA,that more has to be done. Carbon belts have,128
NA,to be tightened in every household. It was,128
NA,"great to see these 15-, 16-, 17and 18-year-",128
NA,old guys and girls who have done it a bit,128
NA,tough being given the opportunity to train,128
NA,and do their bit to save the planet.,128
NA,That view is not necessarily shared by,128
NA,everyone in the House or in the Senate; there,128
NA,are people who still do not quite get it. I,128
NA,know that all the forward-thinking members,128
NA,of the Liberal Party would certainly be in,128
NA,favour of getting some legislation in as soon,128
NA,as possible-legislation that would be ahead,128
NA,"of the curve, as they say, in what the world",128
NA,"needs. However, it is not a bad thing for Aus-",128
NA,tralia to take a leadership position when it,128
NA,comes to climate change. As I indicated ear-,128
NA,"lier in my speech, there will be job opportu-",128
NA,nities and opportunities to export our tech-,128
NA,nologies and knowledge around the world if,128
NA,we can steal a march on those other countries,128
NA,that are still filled with sceptics. I would,128
NA,"to think that in this parliament in 2009, after",128
NA,all the debates in the House and in the Senate,128
NA,"about climate change, people will find out",128
NA,that this was the group of people that be-,128
NA,"trayed the later generations, that this was the",128
NA,group of people who did not read the writing,128
NA,writ large on the wall. Still there are sceptics.,128
NA,"Still there are people who go overseas, talk",128
NA,to a couple of scientists-possibly not main-,128
NA,stream scientists; I do not know-and then,128
NA,"say, ‘Oh no, I spoke to someone who had a",128
NA,"different view; therefore, we need to revise",128
NA,our whole understanding.' I am hoping that,128
NA,those opposite will take the opportunity to,128
NA,inform their caucus and that we will have,128
NA,some movement on this legislation so that,128
NA,those young people whom I met during my,128
NA,visits to the Green Corps can take heart from,128
NA,the politicians in this House. I commend the,128
NA,bill to the House.,128
Ms HALL ,Shortland) (8.18 pm)-It,128
NA,gives me great pleasure to speak on the So-,128
NA,cial Security and Other Legislation Amend-,128
NA,ment (Australian Apprentices) Bill 2009 in,128
NA,the House tonight. This bill will amend the,128
NA,"Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, the Social",128
NA,Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitle-,128
NA,ments Act 1986 to allow Australian appren-,128
NA,"tices to receive the full value, without deduc-",128
NA,"tion, of payments made under Skills for Sus-",128
NA,tainability for Australian Apprentices and,128
NA,Tools For Your Trade within the Australian,128
NA,Apprenticeship Incentives Program. In addi-,128
NA,"tion, it will make the taxation treatment of",128
NA,payments under the two new programs con-,128
NA,sistent with the treatment of previous pro-,128
NA,grams that deliver payments to Australian,128
NA,apprentices.,128
NA,There is no more important role that a,128
NA,government can play than to ensure that Aus-,128
NA,tralia has appropriately trained tradespeople.,128
NA,How do you get appropriately trained trades-,128
NA,people? People need to undertake appren-,128
NA,"ticeships. Unfortunately, under the previous",128
NA,hate government a chronic skills shortage was,128
NA,allowed to develop in many of the trades.,128
NA,"Coming from the Hunter, in which my elec-",128
NA,"torate of Shortland is situated, it was very",128
NA,apparent that employers were unable to ob-,128
NA,tain suitably qualified tradespeople. Unfortu-,128
NA,"nately for Australia, the Howard government",128
NA,chose to do absolutely nothing. They allowed,128
NA,this chronic skills shortage to get worse and,128
NA,worse. That meant that we had fewer and,128
NA,fewer qualified tradespeople. The Rudd gov-,128
NA,ernment's approach is totally different to the,128
NA,Howard government's approach. We know,128
NA,that Australia is part of a global market. We,128
NA,are part of the global economy. For Australia,128
NA,to benefit from being part of that global mar-,128
NA,"ket and global economy, we must have ap-",128
NA,"propriately trained tradespeople, tradespeo-",128
NA,ple who have completed apprenticeships and,128
NA,tradespeople who are highly skilled. The,128
NA,only way we will get these tradespeople is,128
NA,for them to undertake apprenticeships. The,129
NA,financial impact of the Skills for Sustainabil-,129
NA,ity for Australian Apprentices is estimated to,129
NA,cost about $20 million over four years. The,129
NA,"other program, Tools For Your Trade within",129
NA,the broader Australian Apprenticeship Incen-,129
NA,"tives Program, is estimated to cost about",129
NA,$670.1 million over four years. Every cent of,129
NA,"that is worthwhile spending, because it will",129
NA,encourage more young people to undertake,129
NA,apprenticeships.,129
NA,I know that when the previous govern-,129
NA,ment was in power there was a lot of rhetoric,129
NA,"about supporting apprentices, about training",129
NA,"apprentices, about how undertaking an occu-",129
NA,pation as a tradesperson was a noble aspira-,129
NA,tion. We know that and we are making it,129
NA,possible by putting in place programs like,129
NA,these two that are included in this legislation.,129
NA,"As I have already indicated, the bill exempts",129
NA,the value of payments made under Skills for,129
NA,Sustainability for Australian Apprentices and,129
NA,Tools For Your Trade from treatment as as-,129
NA,sessable income for income tax purposes and,129
NA,from the income tax test for benefits under,129
NA,social security and veterans affairs legisla-,129
NA,tion. This is a major incentive for young,129
NA,people to undertake training as apprentices.,129
NA,The amendments ensure that Australian ap-,129
NA,prentices receive the full benefit of the pay-,129
NA,ments made under the two new programs.,129
NA,They are consistent with the taxation treat-,129
NA,ment of previous programs that have paid,129
NA,personal benefits to Australian apprentices.,129
NA,While we are talking about apprentices,129
NA,"and apprenticeship programs, I would like to",129
NA,share with the House details of the launch of,129
NA,a program that took place in the Hunter last,129
NA,"Wednesday, 10 June. It was a rather cold",129
NA,morning and 60 bold and brave souls turned,129
NA,out early for the launch of the Adopt an Ap-,129
NA,prentice program. The campaign was,129
NA,launched by nine group training schools,129
NA,"working in Newcastle, Lake Macquarie, the",129
NA,Hunter Valley and the Central Coast. I might,129
NA,add that the Shortland electorate also takes in,129
NA,the Central Coast. The campaign is to keep,129
NA,apprentices working during the current,129
NA,downturn. It is really important to emphasise,129
NA,that we have had a skills shortage in the eco-,129
NA,nomic good times and what we need to do,129
NA,now is train our young people so they will be,129
NA,ready once the downturn is over. The group,129
NA,training organisations have set aside their,129
NA,own interests and identities as entities and set,129
NA,out to work together. That is a really impor-,129
NA,tant point. They are joining together in a,129
NA,campaign aimed at assisting employers and,129
NA,also apprentices whose training positions are,129
NA,under threat. I congratulate all those who are,129
NA,"involved, especially the group training com-",129
NA,"pany NovaSkill, who have provided the",129
NA,leadership on this initiative. To anyone who,129
NA,may be listening in the Hunter-Central Coast,129
NA,"area, I have considerable information on this",129
NA,program that can be obtained from my elec-,129
NA,torate office.,129
NA,The Adopt an Apprentice program will as-,129
NA,sist apprentices to continue their trade train-,129
NA,ing and the completion of their trade qualifi-,129
NA,cation at a time when their jobs under threat.,129
NA,Employers will have maintained a pool of,129
NA,skilled labour to meet future demands as the,129
NA,economy recovers. Potential employers,129
NA,should go to the website and have a look at,129
NA,the availability of apprentices and then regis-,129
NA,ter their interest with the responsible group,129
NA,training program. The Adopt an Apprentice,129
NA,"campaign is a call to arms, which is the way",129
NA,the group apprenticeship organisations have,129
NA,"put it. It is a call to arms, and employers are",129
NA,working together to keep young apprentices,129
NA,in work in these uncertain times. The cam-,129
NA,"paign highlights that young apprentices,",129
NA,"through no fault of their own, are affected",129
NA,and still need to complete their training. Ini-,129
NA,tiatives like this really show what can be,129
NA,done. If people are interested in checking it,129
NA,"out, the website for the Adopt an Apprentice",129
NA,program is:,129
NA,www.apprenticeships.det.nsw.ed.au.,130
NA,They can obtain the information that they,130
NA,need from that website.,130
NA,The reason I have brought this program to,130
NA,the attention of the House is that it recog-,130
NA,nises how important tradespeople are to Aus-,130
NA,tralia. This program recognises that govern-,130
NA,ments should do everything in their power to,130
NA,help young people complete their apprentice-,130
NA,ships. Skills for Sustainability for Australian,130
NA,Apprentices is one such program. It is a pilot,130
NA,program within the Skills for the Carbon,130
NA,Challenge initiative. This initiative is an out-,130
NA,come of Australia's 2020 Summit which,130
NA,aims to accelerate industries' and tertiary,130
NA,education's response to climate change. It is,130
NA,an innovative program aimed at training ap-,130
NA,prentices and giving them the kinds of skills,130
NA,that they will need for the future. To encour-,130
NA,age Australian apprentices to undertake sus-,130
NA,"tainability related training, the payment of",130
NA,"$1,000 will be provided to eligible Australian",130
NA,apprentices who have successfully com-,130
NA,pleted the required level of training which,130
NA,teaches skills as to sustainable and environ-,130
NA,"mentally sustainable work practices, all very",130
NA,important at this time. It was only last week,130
NA,that we debated the CPRS legislation in this,130
NA,parliament and now we are encouraging,130
NA,young people to obtain trade qualifications in,130
NA,"environmental areas, which is very impor-",130
NA,tant.,130
NA,There is also the Tools For Your Trade,130
NA,payment initiative within the broader Austra-,130
NA,lian Apprenticeships Incentives Program.,130
NA,That combines and extends three administra-,130
NA,tively complex programs previously avail-,130
NA,able to Australian apprentices. So it is good,130
NA,for employers and it is good for apprentices.,130
NA,The new payment initiative comprises five,130
NA,"separate cash payments totalling $3,800, paid",130
NA,over the life of the Australian apprenticeship.,130
NA,The new arrangement reduces the adminis-,130
NA,trative burden on employers of Australian,130
NA,"apprentices, broadening eligibility criteria.",130
NA,By doing that it is benefiting more Australian,130
NA,"apprentices and it is also, as I have men-",130
NA,"tioned, benefiting employers. It will ensure",130
NA,that Australian apprentices in areas of skill,130
NA,shortages become trained. These apprentices,130
NA,are eligible for the same level of government,130
NA,support regardless of their age and of their,130
NA,employer's size. These two new programs,130
NA,represent significant measures and encourage,130
NA,Australian apprentices to develop skills in,130
NA,sustainability in order to participate in the,130
NA,workforce.,130
NA,This is important legislation. The issue of,130
NA,training apprentices was brought up at the,130
NA,2020 Summit. Payments under Skills for,130
NA,Sustainability for Australian Apprentices is a,130
NA,"very important measure, as are all the meas-",130
NA,ures in this legislation. The legislation that,130
NA,we have before us today should be supported,130
NA,by all in the House. By supporting this legis-,130
NA,lation we are ensuring that we have suitably,130
NA,trained tradespeople for the future.,130
NA,Debate interrupted.,130
NA,PETITIONS,130
NA,Responses,130
NA,Mrs Irwin-On behalf of the Standing,130
NA,"Committee on Petitions, and in accordance",130
NA,"with standing order 209, I present the follow-",130
NA,ing ministerial responses to petitions that,130
NA,have been received:,130
NA,Mr Farzad Kamangar,130
NA,Dear Mrs Irwin,130
NA,Thank you for your letter dated 8 May 2009 on,130
NA,"behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions,",130
NA,concerning a petition against the death penalty in,130
NA,Iran and the possible execution of a Kurdish Ira-,130
NA,"nian teacher, Mr Farzad Kamangar.",130
NA,The Government is committed to promoting in-,130
NA,"ternational human rights standards in Iran, includ-",130
NA,ing equal treatment for all Iran's citizens. The,130
NA,Australian Government is deeply concerned by,130
NA,reports of persecution of political and social ac-,130
NA,tivists and the ongoing suppression of freedom of,131
NA,expression.,131
NA,"Australian officials, in Canberra and Tehran, have",131
NA,made clear repeatedly to the Iranian authorities,131
NA,Australia's strong concerns about human rights in,131
NA,"Iran. In addition, Australia has joined with the",131
NA,European Union in representations to the Iranian,131
NA,"Government, calling on Iran to fulfil its interna-",131
NA,"tional human rights obligations, including with",131
NA,respect to Mr Kamangar's Kurdish community.,131
NA,"On the specific case of Mr Kamangar, we joined",131
NA,with the European Union in 2008 in expressing,131
NA,our concerns to the Government of Iran. As far as,131
NA,"we are aware, Mr Kamangar's sentence of execu-",131
NA,tion has not been carried out. Our Embassy in,131
NA,Tehran will continue to monitor his case.,131
NA,The Government also has a policy of global op-,131
NA,"position to the death penalty, and is working with",131
NA,the international community to achieve its univer-,131
NA,sal abolition. Australia was an original co-sponsor,131
NA,of this year's United Nations General Assembly's,131
NA,resolution on the moratorium on the use of the,131
NA,"death penalty, and is working actively with like-",131
NA,minded countries in New York to ensure that this,131
NA,issue remains on the General Assembly's agenda.,131
NA,The Australian Government will continue to raise,131
NA,its concerns about human rights in Iran with the,131
NA,Iranian authorities.,131
NA,Thank you for referring this petition to me.,131
NA,"From the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr",131
NA,Stephen Smith.,131
NA,Education Funding,131
NA,Dear Mrs Irwin,131
NA,Thank you for your letter dated 8 May 2009 about,131
NA,the petition submitted for the Committee's con-,131
NA,sideration on the proposal to relocate the East,131
NA,Gippsland TAFE and to develop a multi-sports,131
NA,complex for the Gippsland region. An application,131
NA,for these activities was recently submitted by,131
NA,Wellington Shire Council under the Regional and,131
NA,Local Community Infrastructure Program-,131
NA,Strategic Projects (RLCIP-SP).,131
NA,I am pleased to inform you that the application,131
NA,submitted to the RLCIP-SP by the Council for the,131
NA,Gippsland Regional Sports Complex - Sale has,131
NA,"been approved for funding of $3,250,000. The",131
NA,Rudd Government is delivering record funding of,131
NA,$800 million to local governments under the,131
NA,RLCIP to build and improve community infra-,131
NA,"structure, support local jobs, and stimulate local",131
NA,economies during the global economic recession.,131
NA,Thank you for raising this matter.,131
NA,"From the Minister for Infrastructure,",131
NA,"Transport, Regional Development and",131
NA,"Local Government, Mr Albanese.",131
NA,Statements,131
Mrs IRWIN ,Fowler) (8.31 pm)-In re-,131
NA,cent weeks during my statements to the,131
NA,House I have focused on the value that has,131
NA,been gained from public hearings held by the,131
NA,Standing Committee on Petitions. The com-,131
NA,mittee has been very pleased with the level,131
NA,of engagement from petitioners and with the,131
NA,support it has received from ministers and,131
NA,"departments. This evening, I would like to",131
NA,refer to two other aspects of the committee's,131
NA,"work, and to some of the benefits that we can",131
NA,hope to gain. The first aspect relates to ac-,131
NA,cess to information about petitions and the,131
NA,second aspect relates to the cooperation and,131
NA,goodwill that is shown to the committee by,131
NA,other parliaments as they share information,131
NA,about their petitions processes.,131
NA,"As you know, Madam Deputy Speaker,",131
NA,the petitions committee was first established,131
NA,in this the 42nd Parliament. To some extent it,131
NA,"is carving out new territory, although, of",131
NA,"course, I acknowledge the long tradition of",131
NA,petitions to the United Kingdom parliament,131
NA,and the inheritance in Australia of the right,131
NA,to petition our parliament. Australians have,131
NA,long been exercising that right. Something,131
NA,"that is new to our petitions process, I believe,",131
NA,is the high degree of responsiveness by the,131
NA,executive to issues that are raised in peti-,131
NA,"tions. In this way, I would argue that peti-",131
NA,tions can be seen to have a greater impact,131
NA,and petitioners may feel they are having in-,131
NA,creased success in getting their message,131
NA,across.,131
NA,"Something else that is new to the House,",132
NA,and which may be contributing to the effec-,132
NA,"tiveness of petitioning, is the petitions com-",132
NA,mittee's centralised collection and publica-,132
NA,tion on its website of information about peti-,132
NA,tions. That information includes details on,132
NA,"the process of petitioning the House, the",132
NA,"terms of petitions, statements made by mem-",132
NA,"bers when presenting those petitions, evi-",132
NA,dence given to the committee by petitioners,132
NA,and public servants and the written responses,132
NA,made by ministers when the committee re-,132
NA,fers petitions to them.,132
NA,Anyone who is interested is able to see on,132
NA,the committee's website not only the terms,132
NA,of petitions that have been presented to the,132
NA,House-collected under headings that relate,132
NA,to the portfolio area covering the subject of,132
NA,the petition-but also other petitions that,132
NA,relate to the same subject areas. They can,132
NA,also see very clearly the ways that the issues,132
NA,that have been raised in the petitions have,132
NA,"been dealt with by members, the House and",132
NA,the government. Enabling easy public access,132
NA,to this information is a significant aspect of,132
NA,the committee's work.,132
NA,When the House or Representatives,132
NA,Standing Committee on Procedure presented,132
NA,"its 2007 report on petitioning the House, it",132
NA,began a process that culminated in the,132
NA,changing of arrangements for petitions and,132
NA,the establishment of the petitions committee.,132
NA,The Procedure Committee considered itself,132
NA,bound by six principles of petitioning. I will,132
NA,"outline those principles, and what I think the",132
NA,committee intended by them. The principles,132
NA,"were that, first, petitions belong to the pub-",132
NA,lic. Behind this is the belief that the ability,132
NA,members of the public to communicate di-,132
NA,rectly with the House is important to our,132
NA,"democracy. Secondly, petitions sent to the",132
NA,House should be addressed by the House.,132
NA,The Procedure Committee considered that,132
NA,the establishment of a petitions committee,132
NA,was the most effective way for the House to,132
NA,"act in relation to petitions. Thirdly, govern-",132
NA,ments should respond. The Procedure Com-,132
NA,mittee wanted to encourage ministers and,132
NA,their departments to respond in a timely way,132
NA,"to the issues raised in petitions. Fourthly,",132
NA,members' involvement should be enhanced,132
NA,"and streamlined. By this, the Procedure",132
NA,Committee meant that members had an im-,132
NA,portant role to play in raising and debating,132
NA,"the issues addressed in petitions. Fifthly,",132
NA,rules should be relevant and fair. The com-,132
NA,"mittee sought to encourage a process, includ-",132
NA,"ing the process of preparing petitions, which",132
NA,"was easier for petitioners. Sixthly, informa-",132
NA,tion technologies should be used more effec-,132
NA,tively. The traditional right of people to ad-,132
NA,dress their grievances directly to the King,132
NA,now needs to be aligned with modern tech-,132
NA,"nology. In particular, the Procedure Commit-",132
NA,tee stated that the House could not ignore the,132
NA,possibilities raised by electronic petitions. I,132
NA,"suggest that these principles have, to one",132
NA,"degree or another, been applied.",132
NA,I would like to expand on the final princi-,132
NA,"ple, the effective use of information technol-",132
NA,"ogy, and some unexpected benefits that have",132
NA,"been obtained. In June last year, the Petitions",132
NA,Committee decided to inquire into the intro-,132
NA,duction of an electronic petitioning system,132
NA,for the House of Representatives. In particu-,132
NA,"lar, the committee wanted to consider the",132
NA,different models of electronic petitioning that,132
NA,"might be introduced, changes that might be",132
NA,required to House practices and procedures,132
NA,"in order to implement e-petitions, the role of",132
NA,"members, privacy and security concerns,",132
NA,resource implications and the experience of,132
NA,of other relevant jurisdictions. This is a signifi-,132
NA,cant inquiry for the committee and the House,132
NA,and it will be completed later this year.,132
NA,The committee was grateful to hear from,132
NA,other parliaments about their innovations in,132
NA,petitions. It has received submissions from,132
NA,the House of Assembly and the Legislative,132
NA,Council in Tasmania and the Scottish Par-,132
NA,liament Public Petitions Committee. The,133
NA,committee has held a videoconference with,133
NA,"the Scottish committee, enabling a very con-",133
NA,structive discussion and establishing a rela-,133
NA,tionship that continues to this day. The Scot-,133
NA,tish committee is about to report on its in-,133
NA,"quiry into the public petitions process, and",133
NA,the report will be read with interest. The,133
NA,"Queensland parliament, like the Scottish Par-",133
NA,"liament Public Petitions Committee, is gen-",133
NA,erous in sharing information and views on,133
NA,the issues raised by e-petitions. The issues,133
NA,raised by petitions in modern parliaments are,133
NA,many and varied and the experience gained,133
NA,by other parliaments is valuable to us. In,133
NA,"closing, I would like to acknowledge the co-",133
NA,operative attitude of committees and parlia-,133
NA,ments in other jurisdictions and the profes-,133
NA,sional relationships being developed by the,133
NA,petitions committee. I think what we have in,133
NA,common is a definite commitment to facili-,133
NA,tating direct engagement by members of the,133
NA,public with our parliaments.,133
NA,COMMITTEES,133
NA,Intelligence and Security Committee,133
Mr BEVIS ,Brisbane) (8.37 pm)-On,133
NA,behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee,133
NA,"on Intelligence and Security, I present the",133
NA,committee's report entitled Review of the re-,133
NA,"listing of Ansar al-Islam, AAA, IAA, IMU,",133
NA,JeM and LeJ as terrorist organisations.,133
NA,Ordered that the report be made a parlia-,133
NA,mentary paper.,133
Mr BEVIS,This report has departed,133
NA,from the usual format of terrorist proscrip-,133
NA,tion reports. In this report the committee has,133
NA,sought some improvements with respect to,133
NA,the statement of reasons process. The com-,133
NA,mittee recommends that in future the Attor-,133
NA,ney-General provide the committee with a,133
NA,statement of reasons where a decision is,133
NA,"taken not to re-list an organisation, similar",133
NA,that now supplied when an organisation is,133
NA,listed.,133
NA,There is no requirement for the Attorney-,133
NA,General to provide the committee with de-,133
NA,tailed reasons when he decides not to re-list,133
NA,"an organisation. However, it would be useful",133
NA,"if, where the Attorney-General has decided",133
NA,he will not be re-listing an organisation as a,133
NA,terrorist organisation under the Criminal,133
NA,"Code, a statement of reasons explaining his",133
NA,decision is provided to the committee and,133
NA,that there also be a publicly released state-,133
NA,ment of reasons.,133
NA,The committee was advised that the At-,133
NA,torney-General recently considered advice,133
NA,from the Director-General of Security with,133
NA,respect to the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ).,133
NA,Based on that advice he stated he would not,133
NA,be re-listing EIJ as a terrorist organisation,133
NA,under the Criminal Code after the current,133
NA,listing expired on 30 March 2009. The com-,133
NA,mittee's recommendations would enhance,133
NA,transparency and public confidence in this,133
NA,important process.,133
NA,The committee in this parliament and ear-,133
NA,Report lier parliaments has taken the view that the,133
NA,non-statutory guidelines used by ASIO are a,133
NA,useful tool in evaluating the evidence sup-,133
NA,porting a listing or re-listing. The committee,133
NA,believes it would be helpful in its role if the,133
NA,statement of reasons were written in part in a,133
NA,way that directly links the evidence with the,133
NA,ASIO guidelines.,133
NA,This approach would also better inform,133
NA,public understanding of the listing process,133

NA,The committee has also requested that fu-,133

Mr RUDDOCK ,Berowra) (8.43 pm)-I,134
NA,intend to speak in support of the report and,134
NA,the remarks of the chair in relation to the,135
NA,continued proscription of these six organisa-,135
NA,tions. They were organisations initially listed,135
NA,"as terrorist organisations in 2003, and each of",135
NA,them had been listed on the United Nations,135
NA,list of terrorist organisations. They came up,135
NA,for review under the new legislative ar-,135
NA,"rangements passed by parliament in 2004,",135
NA,and the committee therefore reviewed the,135
NA,first re-listing of these organisations in 2005.,135
NA,"Following this, the committee again re-",135
NA,viewed these re-listings in June 2007. So this,135
NA,is the third review of re-listing of these six,135
NA,terrorist organisations. The chair has been,135
NA,through a brief outline of the circumstances,135
NA,which lead us to a view that the Attorney has,135
NA,properly listed these organisations.,135
NA,In the report is some useful information to,135
NA,help guide those who are interested in under-,135
NA,standing the sorts of criteria that apply in,135
NA,relation to listing organisations. ASIO's,135
NA,"guidelines, as they were outlined to us in",135
NA,"evidence in 2005, include factors such as",135
NA,"engagement in terrorism, ideology and links",135
NA,"to other terrorist groups or networks, links to",135
NA,"Australia, the threat to Australian interests,",135
NA,proscription by the United Nations or like-,135
NA,"minded countries, and engagement in peace",135
NA,and mediation processes. The committee,135
NA,noted that these guidelines are indicators,135
NA,only and not formally set out in the act but,135
NA,has found them a useful tool in its delibera-,135
NA,tions. The committee continues to use these,135
NA,guidelines to assist it in relation to its re-,135
NA,views.,135
NA,The Federation of Community Legal Cen-,135
NA,"tres made the point to us that, in the case of",135
NA,"six organisations, the statements of reasons",135
NA,did not identify that any of the organisations,135
NA,in question have links to Australia. I note that,135
NA,the committee's view is that it is a misunder-,135
NA,standing of the statutory scheme to suggest,135
NA,that listing of an organisation with no identi-,135
NA,fiable links to Australia exceeds the scope of,135
NA,the legislative intent or is a misuse of power.,135
NA,"The committee takes the view that, while",135
NA,direct links to Australia are not a statutory,135
NA,"prerequisite, links are appropriate considera-",135
NA,tions in the selection of organisations for,135
NA,proscription. I think it is important because,135
NA,in the context of threats to Australia's inter-,135
NA,ests they can be posed to our citizens abroad,135
NA,as well as our interests that extend beyond,135
NA,the territorial boundaries of Australia. They,135
NA,are matters that were relevant to the commit-,135
NA,tee in its deliberations in relation to these,135
NA,particular organisations.,135
NA,I continue to be impressed with the quality,135
NA,of the deliberations of my colleagues on,135
NA,these matters. I have seen the other side of,135
NA,"the wicket, as it were, and believe that they",135
NA,bring a very mature deliberation to this task.,135
NA,I think it is one of the most important tasks,135
NA,that parliamentary committees can be en-,135
NA,gaged in. The committee is assisted by a very,135
NA,able secretary. I see Robert Little in the ad-,135
NA,visers' box; he is the inquiry secretary. I say,135
NA,to him and his colleagues that we very much,135
NA,value your collective efforts and the work,135
NA,that you undertake to ensure that in relation,135
NA,to these very important deliberations we are,135
NA,well informed and able to fulfil our responsi-,135
NA,bilities.,135
NA,I commend the report of the committee to,135
NA,the House and assure honourable members,135
NA,that these matters are important. They are,135
NA,important for securing the safety of the,135
NA,broader Australian community based here,135
NA,and abroad. I am delighted to be associated,135
NA,with this particular report.,135
NA,Treaties Committee,135
NA,Report,135
Mr KELVIN THOMSON ,Wills) (8.48,135
NA,pm)-On behalf of the Joint Standing Com-,135
NA,"mittee on Treaties, I present the committee's",135
NA,report entitled Report 101: Treaties tabled on,135
NA,3 February 2009,135
NA,Ordered that the report be made a parlia-,135
NA,mentary paper.,135
Mr KELVIN THOMSON,In present-,136
NA,ing Report 101 of the Joint Standing Com-,136
NA,"mittee on Treaties, I note that this report",136
NA,"views two treaty actions: firstly, the Conven-",136
NA,tion on the Protection and Promotion of the,136
NA,"Diversity of Cultural Expressions and, sec-",136
NA,"ondly, the Agreement between Australia and",136
NA,the European Community on Trade in Wine.,136
NA,In each case the treaties committee has sup-,136
NA,ported the proposed treaties and has recom-,136
NA,mended that binding treaty action be taken.,136
NA,The Convention on the Protection and,136
NA,Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Ex-,136
NA,pressions identifies the expression of culture,136
NA,by an individual or group as a tangible entity.,136
NA,The purpose of the convention is to protect,136
NA,and promote the diverse range of these cul-,136
NA,tural expressions in an increasingly global-,136
NA,ised world. The convention requires nations,136
NA,to undertake to assist the creation of cultural,136
NA,expressions both domestically and abroad,136
NA,"through regulatory, legislative, financial and",136
NA,technical assistance and to report to the,136
NA,United Nations on these measures. The con-,136
NA,vention is particularly concerned with secur-,136
NA,ing cultural expressions that are under im-,136
NA,mediate threat and securing the cultural ex-,136
NA,pressions of developing nations.,136
NA,The treaties committee is of the view that,136
NA,the convention will help to develop and,136
NA,maintain Australia's cultural industries,136
NA,protect Australia's valuable cultural expres-,136
NA,sions. The committee considers that acces-,136
NA,sion to the convention will demonstrate to,136
NA,the international community Australia's,136
NA,commitment to cultural diversity and that it,136
NA,will expand Australia's active engagement,136
NA,with UNESCO.,136
NA,The treaties committee also considered the,136
NA,Agreement between Australia and the Euro-,136
NA,pean Community on Trade in Wine. Under,136
NA,this agreement Australia and the European,136
NA,Community are required to accept a range of,136
NA,wine labelling restrictions based on the pro-,136
NA,duction and geographical origin of the wine,136
NA,and to recognise 16 previously unauthorised,136
NA,"rewinemaking techniques. Significantly, Aus-",136
NA,tralian fortified winemakers will be required,136
NA,to phase out the use of the terms ‘port' and,136
NA,‘sherry' within 12 months of the entry into,136
NA,force of the agreement and the term ‘tokay',136
NA,will have to be phased out within 10 years of,136
NA,the agreement's entry into force.,136
NA,The Australian Wine and Brandy Corpora-,136
NA,"tion assured the committee that, whilst there",136
NA,will be a cost to the industry in ceasing the,136
NA,"use of these wine names, the agreement will",136
NA,secure the use of terms which are valuable to,136
NA,"Australia's fortified wine industry, including",136
NA,"‘ruby', ‘tawny', ‘vintage' and ‘cream'. Fur-",136
NA,"thermore, the government has provided fi-",136
NA,nancial assistance which will assist in the,136
NA,rebadging of wines. This project will see the,136
NA,term ‘sherry' replaced with the term ‘apera',136
NA,within 12 months and the term ‘tokay' re-,136
NA,placed with ‘topaque' within 10 years.,136
NA,In exchange for Australia's acceptance of,136
NA,"these labelling restrictions, the European",136
NA,Community will be required to permit the,136
NA,import and marketing of Australian wines,136
NA,produced using 16 winemaking techniques,136
NA,which previously lacked authorisation.,136
NA,"Therefore, Australian winemakers stand to",136
NA,gain greater access to European wine mar-,136
NA,and to kets under the agreement.,136
NA,The treaties committee considers that ac-,136
NA,cession to the agreement will strengthen,136
NA,trade between Australia and the European,136
NA,Community and is of the view that the,136
NA,agreement will provide Australian winemak-,136
NA,ers with greater and more secure access to,136
NA,European wine markets. I thank the numer-,136
NA,"ous agencies, individuals and organisations",136
NA,who assisted in the treaties committee's in-,136
NA,"quiries, and I thank the treaties committee",136
NA,secretariat for its assistance in preparing this,136
NA,report. I commend the report to the House.,136

NA,Report,137
Mr DREYFUS ,Isaacs) (8.53 pm)-On,137
NA,behalf of the Standing Committee on Legal,137
NA,"and Constitutional Affairs, I present the",137
NA,committee's report entitled Access all areas:,137
NA,Report of the inquiry into Draft Disability,137
NA,"(Access to Premise-Buildings) Standards,",137
NA,together with the minutes of proceedings and,137
NA,evidence received by the committee.,137
NA,Ordered that the report be made a parlia-,137
NA,mentary paper.,137
Mr DREYFUS,It is my pleasure to pre-,137
NA,sent the report Access all areas: Report of,137
NA,the inquiry into Draft Disability (Access to,137
NA,"Premise-Buildings) Standards, which is the",137
NA,third report of the committee for this parlia-,137
NA,ment. There are approximately four million,137
NA,"people with a disability in Australia, a num-",137
NA,ber which is expected to increase as the,137
NA,population ages. Every day people with a,137
NA,disability face physical barriers in the,137
NA,"munity, from a doorway too narrow for a",137
NA,"wheelchair, to not being able to visit their",137
NA,member of parliament because his or her,137
NA,office is located at the top of a flight of,137
NA,stairs. These physical barriers to the built,137
NA,environment have broader consequences for,137
NA,"people with a disability, in restricting their",137
NA,access to the economic and social environ-,137
NA,ment of our community.,137
NA,The draft Premises Standards are designed,137
NA,to make buildings more accessible for people,137
NA,"with mobility, vision and hearing impair-",137
NA,"ments. If introduced, the Premises Standards",137
NA,"will have a widespread impact, changing",137
NA,buildings regulations for new buildings and,137
NA,existing buildings undergoing significant,137
NA,upgrades.,137
NA,"As well as providing improved access, the",137
NA,Premises Standards would also provide cer-,137
NA,"tainty to building certifiers, developers and",137
NA,managers that they are complying with their,137
NA,obligations under the Commonwealth Dis-,137
NA,ability Discrimination Act. In conducting the,137
NA,"inquiry, the committee received evidence",137
NA,"from disability advocacy groups, the prop-",137
NA,erty and building sectors and many con-,137
NA,cerned individuals. The level of interest in,137
NA,the inquiry clearly demonstrates how impor-,137
NA,tant these issues are to people with a disabil-,137
NA,ity.,137
NA,The report reflects the unanimous view of,137
NA,the committee that the Premises Standards,137
NA,should be finalised and introduced without,137
NA,"delay. However, there are a number of areas",137
NA,of the Premises Standards which should be,137
NA,amended prior to their introduction. The,137
NA,committee has recommended that access be,137
NA,provided to the common areas of class 2,137
NA,"buildings, such as residential apartment",137
NA,buildings. It is clear that the market has not,137
NA,responded to the needs of people with a dis-,137
NA,ability or to the requirements of the Disabil-,137
NA,"ity Discrimination Act, even where class 2",137
NA,buildings are primarily used for short-term,137
NA,"com- accommodation. As a result, people with a",137
NA,disability are excluded from an affordable,137
NA,accommodation option in serviced apart-,137
NA,ments which might otherwise be well suited,137
NA,for their needs. The committee's recommen-,137
NA,dation to include class 2 buildings within the,137
NA,scope of the Premises Standards reflects the,137
NA,overwhelming majority of evidence received.,137
NA,The committee also recommended that the,137
NA,Premises Standards distinguish between new,137
NA,and existing class 1b buildings. These are,137
NA,"bed and breakfast, eco-lodges and similar",137
NA,accommodation. The committee found that,137
NA,the proportional cost increases imposed by,137
NA,the Premises Standards are substantial in,137
NA,existing class 1b buildings. The committee,137
NA,therefore considers that the current threshold,137
NA,of four bedrooms or dwellings for accessibil-,137
NA,ity in existing buildings is appropriate. How-,137
NA,"ever, the increases in costs flowing from ac-",137
NA,cessibility requirements in new class 1b,137
NA,buildings are much more modest. The com-,137
NA,mittee has therefore recommended that ac-,138
NA,cessibility requirements should be imposed,138
NA,on all new and purpose-built class 1b build-,138
NA,"ings, regardless of the number of rooms or",138
NA,dwellings they provide.,138
NA,Given the long and protracted history of,138
NA,"the development of the Premises Standards,",138
NA,the committee has recommended that they be,138
NA,finalised and introduced without delay.,138
NA,"However, there are a number of areas where",138
NA,more research is required and other areas,138
NA,which are the result of previous negotiation,138
NA,and compromise. It is important to assess,138
NA,"whether the standards, and certain provisions",138
NA,"in the standards, are working to achieve their",138
NA,"object and purpose. As a result, the commit-",138
NA,tee has made a detailed recommendation re-,138
NA,lating to the review of the Premises Stan-,138
NA,dards after some years of operation.,138
NA,I would like to thank the other members of,138
NA,the committee and the skilled and dedicated,138
NA,staff of the secretariat who worked on this,138
NA,"important inquiry: Anna Dacre, Serica Mac-",138
NA,"kay, Stephen Still and Sharon Bryant, some",138
NA,of whom are with us in the advisers box. I,138
NA,would also like to acknowledge the contribu-,138
NA,"tion of all those who shared their time, ex-",138
NA,pertise and experience with the committee,138
NA,during this inquiry. I have spoken of the,138
NA,committee's key recommendations for the,138
NA,draft Premises Standards. There are other,138
NA,relatively minor changes discussed in the,138
NA,committee's report.,138
Mr SLIPPER ,Fisher) (8.58 pm)-I am,138
NA,pleased to join the chairman of the commit-,138
NA,tee in supporting the report which has been,138
NA,"tabled by the committee. Once again, it is a",138
NA,unanimous report of the House of Represen-,138
NA,tatives Standing Committee on Legal and,138
NA,Constitutional Affairs. We covered a very,138
NA,important area in relation to disability. This,138
NA,committee seems to work very well together.,138
NA,"It is obviously a cross-party committee, but",138
NA,we put our politics aside when we consider,138
NA,terms of reference referred to us by responsi-,138
NA,ble ministers.,138
NA,With respect to the report being tabled to-,138
NA,"day, the committee was asked by the Attor-",138
NA,ney-General to consider and report on the,138
NA,draft Disability (Access to Premises-,138
NA,Buildings) Standards covering a range of,138
NA,areas including:,138
NA,the appropriateness and effectiveness of the pro-,138
NA,posed Premises Standards in achieving their ob-,138
NA,jects;,138
NA,the interaction between the Premises Standards,138
NA,and existing regulatory schemes operating in state,138
NA,"and territory jurisdictions, including the appropri-",138
NA,ateness and effectiveness of the proposed Model,138
NA,Process to Administer Building Access for People,138
NA,with Disability;,138
NA,whether the Premises Standards will have an un-,138
NA,justifiable impact on any particular sector or,138
NA,group within a sector; and,138
NA,any related matters.,138
NA,The committee received a substantial number,138
NA,of recommendations from across the country,138
NA,"when we advertised for views, and we",138
NA,"wanted to consult widely. In fact, we re-",138
NA,ceived 146 submissions. We held six public,138
NA,hearings and one roundtable hearing. The,138
NA,whole idea of following this process was to,138
NA,try to discern what the Australian community,138
NA,was telling the committee and the parlia-,138
NA,ment.,138
NA,"As a result, following our deliberations",138
NA,the committee made 19 recommendations.,138
NA,The committee chairman outlined some of,138
NA,those recommendations but the first recom-,138
NA,mendation of the report is that Premises,138
NA,Standards should be introduced without de-,138
NA,lay. The Premises Standards has a protracted,138
NA,history and the committee considered that,138
NA,"the benefits it will provide, such as certainty",138
NA,"and accessibility, should not be delayed any",138
NA,further. That was particularly important.,138
NA,One of the key recommendations relates,138
NA,"to class 2 buildings, which are residential",138
NA,apartment buildings. At the moment the,139
NA,Premises Standards does not require these,139
NA,buildings to be accessible. The committee,139
NA,has recommended that the common areas of,139
NA,class 2 buildings should be within the scope,139
NA,"of the Premises Standards-that is, they",139
NA,should be made accessible. There were a,139
NA,number of reasons for that and it was obvi-,139
NA,ous to the committee that those reasons have,139
NA,veracity and that the recommendations ought,139
NA,to be implemented.,139
NA,Class 1b buildings were also the subject of move:,139
NA,recommendation by the committee. Class 1b,139
NA,"buildings include eco-lodges, bed and break-",139
NA,"fasts and holiday cottages. At present, the",139
NA,Premises Standards only applies to class 1b,139
NA,buildings containing four or more bedrooms.,139
NA,This means that the accessibility require-,139
NA,ments of the Premises Standards would not,139
NA,apply to these types of buildings that have,139
NA,fewer than four bedrooms. The committee,139
NA,recognises that many class 1b buildings are,139
NA,run by small businesses with limited re-,139
NA,sources. One of the things about disability,139
NA,and disability regulation is that there has to,139
NA,be a balance. On the one hand we have to,139
NA,give people access and we have to treat peo-,139
NA,ple with disability as being equal to other,139
NA,people in the community. On the other hand,139
NA,we are not really serving the interests of,139
NA,people with disability if we send small busi-,139
NA,ness to the wall in the process.,139
NA,The committee found that it was clear that,139
NA,it is much less expensive to provide access,139
NA,when building a new bed and breakfast or,139
NA,holiday cottage. That is why the committee,139
NA,has recommended that the requirements for,139
NA,accessibility should be imposed on all new,139
NA,and purpose built class 1b buildings regard-,139
NA,less of the number of bedrooms they contain,139
NA,but that the proposed four-bedroom threshold,139
NA,should be maintained for existing buildings.,139
NA,There were a whole range of other matters,139
NA,"in the report, and time will not allow me to",139
NA,"cover them, but they include areas such as",139
NA,"dignity, fit-out, and review. We also pointed",139
NA,out that lessons could be learnt from the re-,139
NA,"view of the transport standards for which,",139
NA,"seven years on, a final report has still not",139
NA,been released. (Time expired),139

NA,"In moving this motion, I hope that the par-",140
NA,liament will join me in recognising the im-,140
NA,portance that sound urban planning has for,140
NA,"the future health and wellbeing of our cities,",140
NA,local communities and us as individuals.,140
NA,With the population of our cities growing,140
NA,"and with the increasing demand for housing,",140
NA,our communities are faced with a challenge,140
NA,of how we best manage this need. The solu-,140
NA,tion is much more complex than just allow-,140
NA,"ing urban sprawl to continue. Rather, as the",140
NA,"motion states, we must take the opportunity",140
NA,to develop communities that maximise the,140
NA,"social, economic and environmental out-",140
NA,comes for local residents. This reflects the,140
NA,Planning Institute of Australia's principles on,140
NA,"urban growth management, which begin by",140
NA,declaring:,140
NA,"Any pattern of urban growth has social, economic",140
NA,and environmental implications that need to be,140
NA,considered and balanced in deciding the most,140
NA,desirable urban growth solution.,140
NA,"This means, as the motion states, that the",140
NA,the planning of our new communities should,140
NA,and consider the availability of local employ-,140
NA,"ment, allowing for people to spend less time",140
NA,travelling to and from work and more time,140
NA,with their families. The motion also makes,140
NA,clear that considerations regarding the health,140
NA,of residents are essential. If we look at the,140
NA,ABS statistics in 2007-08 we find that they,140
NA,show that 68 per cent of all Australian men,140
NA,and 55 per cent of all Australian women are,140
NA,overweight or obese. This is an increase of,140
NA,five per cent since 1995. We need to think,140
NA,about how our town planning may affect,140
NA,"every policy area, including health, and how",140
NA,we might address this issue of obesity in our,140
NA,society. People can be healthier and have a,140
NA,more enjoyable life with the best opportuni-,140
NA,ties if they are at the forefront of planners',140
NA,minds and considerations. This means ensur-,140
NA,ing that transport options connect people to,140
NA,their places of employment and their places,140
NA,of leisure.,140
NA,Transport options should include clean,140
NA,and green modes such as bike paths and pub-,140
NA,lic transport. They also mean making it eas-,140
NA,ier for residents to go to local shops and ser-,140
NA,vices on foot. A well-designed community,140
NA,reduces its carbon footprint by reducing the,140
NA,amount of kilometres driven by each of its,140
NA,"residents, in turn allowing residents to spend",140
NA,more time enjoying the things they like to do,140
NA,"around their local community. On top of this,",140
NA,if people are not driving they are more likely,140
NA,"to be walking or riding their bikes, which, as",140
NA,"I said earlier, is far better for their health and",140
NA,the environment.,140
NA,"As our suburbs keep expanding, as they",140
NA,"are likely to do in Kingston, it is vitally im-",140
NA,portant that we think about what we would,140
NA,like our new suburbs to look like. I know,140
NA,that the RMIT University is currently under-,140
NA,taking a 10-year research program titled ‘Re-,140
NA,imagining the Australian suburb' and I look,140
NA,"forward to reading more of their work, but",140
NA,we already know a number of key things.,141
NA,Our future suburbs need to be designed so,141
NA,that houses and communities minimise water,141
NA,consumption and to allow for the re-use of,141
NA,greywater and stormwater run-off. They need,141
NA,to be planned to minimise energy consump-,141
NA,tion in terms of lighting and other energy,141
NA,use. There are many local communities who,141
NA,are already choosing to take the lead on this.,141
NA,"In my electorate of Kingston, residents of the",141
NA,Aldinga eco-village have prided themselves,141
NA,on their houses and their common commu-,141
NA,nity areas being both water and energy effi-,141
NA,cient.,141
NA,To make sure that we promote the wellbe-,141
NA,"ing of our communities, we must plan to",141
NA,"provide for community spaces, spaces for",141
NA,young and old sports teams to compete and,141
NA,places for families to enjoy and share activi-,141
NA,ties with one another. Urban planning as an,141
NA,"idea has a very short history, but if we do",141
NA,realise the ramifications of bad town plan-,141
NA,ning then our communities will not sustain,141
NA,us into the future. I commend the motion to,141
NA,the House. (Time expired),141
The DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Ms JA Saf-,141
NA,fin)-Is the motion seconded?,141
NA,Mr Dreyfus-I second the motion and re-,141
NA,serve my right to speak.,141
Mr BRIGGS ,Mayo) (9.09 pm)-I rise to,141
NA,join with the member for Kingston on this,141
NA,issue of town planning and support her mo-,141
NA,tion. I understand she comes from an area,141
NA,which has significant planning issues. The,141
NA,Onkaparinga council-the city of Onkapar-,141
NA,inga inches into my electorate-struggles,141
NA,with issues of planning in the southern sub-,141
NA,urbs of Adelaide.,141
NA,There are two issues I wish to deal with,141
NA,tonight with regard to planning. They relate,141
NA,"to my electorate, Mount Barker and sur-",141
NA,"rounds, Littlehampton and Nairne in particu-",141
NA,"lar. Some years ago, in 2000, the Heysen",141
NA,Tunnels opened in the Adelaide Hills on the,141
NA,"Great Eastern Freeway, which opened up the",141
NA,Adelaide Hills significantly. That was the,141
NA,former member for Mayo's greatest,141
NA,"achievement as the member for Mayo, he",141
NA,"proudly boasts, and it certainly has created",141
NA,significant economic development in the,141
NA,"Adelaide Hills, opened them up and changed",141
NA,the dynamic.,141
NA,"However, it also brought an up-tick in",141
NA,"growth-in Mount Barker, Nairne and Lit-",141
NA,tlehampton in particular-which has brought,141
NA,"with it considerable difficulties, with lagging",141
NA,"infrastructure, roads, services and water. Wa-",141
NA,"ter, of course, is a huge issue in my elector-",141
NA,ate. This has been a major concern for my,141
NA,constituents. It has a major impact on our,141
NA,ability to grow our own food. The Adelaide,141
NA,Hills produces not only some of the best,141
NA,wine in the country but also some of the best,141
NA,food. It is an important area for agriculture,141
NA,not and an area we must protect. With this fast,141
NA,expansion there has been a real impact on,141
NA,people's ability to continue to grow their,141
NA,own food. We have seen farmers tempted by,141
NA,offers from developers-as retirement pack-,141
NA,"ages, I guess-for their land. This has cre-",141
NA,"ated an interesting dynamic, where there is",141
NA,now quite an anti-development feeling in,141
NA,Mount Barker and surrounding communities.,141
NA,The second issue I want to deal with is,141
NA,that of future growth in my area. It is an is-,141
NA,"sue which the state member for Kavel, Mark",141
NA,"Goldsworthy, has been following. I com-",141
NA,mend Mark for the work he has done. He,141
NA,"recently surveyed the towns concerned, ask-",141
NA,"ing people's opinions on this issue, and re-",141
NA,"ceived quite an extraordinary reaction, with",141
NA,"about 1,500 survey respondents all very",141
NA,strongly raising concerns about the pace of,141
NA,development and the actions of the state,141
NA,government in relation to development. The,141
NA,"state planning minister, Mr Holloway-who",141
NA,I think is an upper house member in the state,141
NA,"parliament-said in our local newspaper, the",141
NA,"Mount Barker Courier, which has also been",141
NA,"pursuing this issue with some vigour, that the",142
NA,state government will have the final say,142
NA,about continuing development in the region.,142
NA,It is fair to say that that has enraged locals.,142
NA,Rather than locals and the council being con-,142
NA,"sidered and their views taken into account,",142
NA,the state government is just going to bulldoze,142
NA,its way through ordinary people and their,142
NA,views. That has caused an enormous amount,142
NA,of concern in my electorate. Development is,142
NA,"a very contentious issue, particularly as it",142
NA,"impacts on agricultural land, services,",142
NA,"whether we have enough police, hospitals,",142
NA,health care and whether the roads are up to,142
NA,standard. Mount Barker is a country town,142
NA,that is now being turned into a dormitory,142
NA,suburb.,142
NA,"This is a big issue, and I was disappointed",142
NA,with the action of the state government. I,142
NA,hope that they will reconsider the part of,142
NA,their plan-I think it is a 20-year plan-,142
NA,"where they plan for Mount Barker, Little-",142
NA,hampton and Nairne to grow significantly.,142
NA,They should reconsider that. The people in,142
NA,my area want them to do so. What the state,142
NA,Labor minister said and did has been very,142
NA,unpopular. I think people accept that bull-,142
NA,dozers are needed for development but they,142
NA,will not accept their opinion being bulldozed,142
NA,by the state Labor government. They need to,142
NA,reconsider this quickly. I know it is not an,142
NA,area that state Labor has traditionally put,142
NA,"much emphasis on, up around Mount Barker,",142
NA,but it should not be treated as a second rate,142
NA,area because politically it is not important; it,142
NA,is very important to the Adelaide Hills and to,142
NA,South Australia. The Adelaide Hills retains a,142
NA,beauty and it should not just be turned into,142
NA,an outer dormitory suburb. (Time expired),142
Mr DREYFUS ,Isaacs) (9.15 pm)-As,142
NA,someone who is deeply interested in the fu-,142
NA,"ture of our cities, and who believes that the",142
NA,forms of our cities play a critical role in the,142
NA,"sorts of lives we are able to lead, I am",142
NA,pleased to support this motion. The forms,142
NA,our cities take are important. They have a,142
NA,profound influence on our economic prosper-,142
NA,"ity, on the impact we have on our unique",142
NA,"environment, on the level of social exclusion",142
NA,and inequality experienced in our communi-,142
NA,ties and on the quality of life Australians and,142
NA,their families are able to enjoy. Well-thought-,142
NA,out urban planning fosters the free flow of,142
NA,people and goods through major areas of,142
NA,economic activity and service delivery. Good,142
NA,urban planning connects communities with,142
NA,"the labour markets, educational institutions",142
NA,and community networks needed in order for,142
NA,them to flourish.,142
NA,The great majority of Australians live in,142
NA,our major cities. You need only look to,142
NA,greater Melbourne or south-east Queensland,142
NA,to see the rapid expansion of our urban pe-,142
NA,riphery. Our local community in my elector-,142
NA,"ate of Isaacs, in Melbourne's south-east",142
NA,"growth corridor, is part of that expansion. We",142
NA,have young families looking for affordable,142
NA,low-density housing in new estates in Keys-,142
NA,"borough, Sandhurst, Carrum Downs and",142
NA,Skye. We have retirees moving from family,142
NA,"homes to smaller properties in newer, denser",142
NA,"developments by the beach in Chelsea, Car-",142
NA,rum and Mentone. We have the growing in-,142
NA,dustrial areas in Dandenong South and Brae-,142
NA,side. And in the middle of my electorate we,142
NA,have a large green wedge. Previous far-,142
NA,sighted planning has preserved this green,142
NA,"wedge, which provides our community with",142
NA,a semirural area close to home.,142
NA,Urban policy in growth areas like my,142
NA,electorate demands careful planning for the,142
NA,needs of a community which is as diverse in,142
NA,age and occupation as it is in income and,142
NA,cultural heritage. Urban policy permeates,142
NA,every level of government involvement in,142
NA,public life. More than most other areas of,142
NA,"policy, urban planning calls for an active role",142
NA,from government because we have a collec-,142
NA,tive interest in the form of our cities. All,142
NA,governments have legitimate policy objec-,142
NA,"tives in areas like economic prosperity,",143
NA,justice and environmental stability. These,143
NA,objectives can be facilitated by the structure,143
NA,of our cities or they can be ignored. Deci-,143
NA,"sions about industry and innovation, migra-",143
NA,"tion, public transport, housing and infrastrucfederal",143
NA,ture all affect the form and function of our,143
NA,cities. To act as if urban planning is not a,143
NA,federal issue does not lessen its federal im-,143
NA,plications; it simply results in poor policy,143
NA,outcomes. Government must be involved in,143
NA,and must lead the planning of our cities. This,143
NA,extends to the federal government as well as,143
NA,to state and local governments.,143
NA,"The Minister for Infrastructure, Transport,",143
NA,Regional Development and Local Govern-,143
NA,ment has created a major cities unit in his,143
NA,department. This major cities unit enables,143
NA,cities and agencies responsible for urban is-,143
NA,sues to have a single point of contact within,143
NA,"the federal government. It is appalling that,",143
NA,for almost 12 years under the previous gov-,143
NA,"ernment, Australia had no Minister for Hous-",143
NA,ing and no major cities strategy. We need to,143
NA,remember that the Labor government that,143
NA,left office in 1996 had created a Better Cities,143
NA,"program and a Better Cities strategy, the ob-",143
NA,jective of which was to address a number of,143
NA,challenges facing Australian cities. Those,143
NA,included rapid growth and a demand for in-,143
NA,frastructure investment on the fringes of ma-,143
NA,"jor cities, loss of population and under-use",143
NA,facilities and services in established urban,143
NA,"areas and the increasing social, environ-",143
NA,mental and economic cost of poorly planned,143
NA,and managed cities. After the 12 years of,143
NA,inaction of the Howard government these are,143
NA,still among the challenges of urban planning,143
NA,that face Australia today.,143
NA,The Rudd government is responding to,143
NA,these challenges through the major cities unit,143
NA,and a coordinated whole-of-government ap-,143
NA,proach to urban planning. Given the signifi-,143
NA,cance of urban planning to our economic,143
NA,"prosperity and social structure, the future of",143
NA,"social our cities demands national leadership,",143
NA,which the Rudd government is providing. I,143
NA,"look forward, in the coming years, to seeing",143
NA,more being done at a federal level in relation,143
NA,"to the urban fabric of our cities, because the",143
NA,government is in the position of be-,143
NA,ing able to provide the leadership which is,143
NA,"needed, the leadership that was sorely lack-",143
NA,ing during the whole of the period of the,143
NA,former Howard government.,143
Mr BILSON ,Dunkley) (9.20 pm)-I,143
NA,rise to support the motion and the sentiment,143
NA,that has been put forward by the member for,143
NA,Kingston and acknowledge her interest in,143
NA,"this area. I do say, though, that sentiment is",143
NA,no substitute for hard work and that words,143
NA,are no substitute for even harder work. And,143
NA,this area of public policy requires not only a,143
NA,lot of hard work but very extensive collabo-,143
NA,"ration, because so many of the influences on",143
NA,successful cities are dispersed right across,143
NA,"multiple levels of government-and, more",143
NA,"importantly, across all the consumers, home",143
NA,"purchasers, developers and investors, all",143
NA,looking at their interests as we in this na-,143
NA,tional parliament look at the national interest.,143
NA,"This is not something new, though. This",143
NA,issue has been with us for some time. The,143
NA,previous government certainly did more than,143
NA,apprise itself of these concerns. It set about,143
NA,"doing something about them. In fact, in the",143
NA,of 2003-04 budget there was an urban environ-,143
NA,ment initiative around sustainable cities. It,143
NA,touched on a number of issues concerning,143
NA,"water quality, the information available",143
NA,"within the community, air quality, renewable",143
NA,"energy, waste management, the Year of the",143
NA,"Built Environment, green buildings, a green",143
NA,"car rating scheme, cycling facilities, air qual-",143
NA,"ity research, photovoltaic rebate schemes,",143
NA,"chemical monitoring database, the National",143
NA,Pollutant Inventory-just to name a few. So,143
NA,this is not something that is particularly new.,143
NA,But it went further. I was pleased to chair,144
NA,the House of Representatives Standing,144
NA,Committee on Environment and Heritage,144
NA,and undertake what was then viewed as a,144
NA,very seminal piece of research and a piece of,144
NA,important national leadership with the sus-,144
NA,tainable cities inquiry. This committee report,144
NA,"was born out of my conviction, and that of",144
NA,the coalition government's side of the par-,144
NA,"liament, that the cities that we have may not",144
NA,be directly a consequence of federal gov-,144
NA,"ernment policy but, when they do not work",144
NA,"well, it lands on the federal government to",144
NA,"provide the remedies. The social hardship,",144
NA,"the economic dislocation, the enormous",144
NA,"commuter times, the cost in terms of envi-",144
NA,"ronment and in terms of family pressure, the",144
NA,economic concerns and the vulnerability of,144
NA,people to movement in petrol prices and the,144
NA,like all come home to the federal govern-,144
NA,ment.,144
NA,"With that in mind we thought, ‘What can",144
NA,we do now to outline a template for more,144
NA,"sustainable cities into the future,' and this",144
NA,report did that. We led that debate and it,144
NA,welcomed unanimously right across the,144
NA,community and in a bipartisan sense. I was,144
NA,promoted into the ministry and did not have,144
NA,the privilege of finishing the final few paraplanning,144
NA,graphs-my friend and colleague Dr Mal,144
NA,Washer had that honour and distinction-but,144
NA,the report is still very much true to the work,144
NA,that we undertook. It talked about the key,144
NA,things that we need to look at in terms of,144
NA,sustainability: to recognise that more than,144
NA,three-quarters of GDP-the economic activ-,144
NA,ity in Australia-happens in our cities; that,144
NA,the vast proportion of the population lives,144
NA,our cites; and to recognise the pressure on,144
NA,"our environment, our consumption of re-",144
NA,sources and our future living standards. All,144
NA,these are interwoven in our cities.,144
NA,The report identified a range of areas of,144
NA,action about urban development and the role,144
NA,that the federal government could play in,144
NA,urban policy in trying to make sure that all,144
NA,decision making and funding was aligned to,144
NA,sustainability and better city objectives. It,144
NA,also looked at settlement patterns: what was,144
NA,happening in terms of dwelling sizes; the,144
NA,size of households; and the different models,144
NA,that were developing around the place and,144
NA,how they could be handled in a development,144
NA,assessment process that did not seek to tell,144
NA,people how and where they should live-,144
NA,because that would be destined to fail-but,144
NA,would at least make it easier and more con-,144
NA,venient for people to live with amenity and,144
NA,lifestyle and with ready access to those im-,144
NA,portant elements of their lives that they,144
NA,"wanted to be near to, and if they were not",144
NA,they would commute.,144
NA,A long time ago I drove a Mazda 808 su-,144
NA,"per deluxe coupe, burnt orange-a great ve-",144
NA,hicle for its time-and at around 19 I,144
NA,stopped driving for pleasure and for the fun,144
NA,of it and started driving because I had to,144
NA,travel somewhere. I had a transport task. The,144
NA,mobility requirement was to move from,144
NA,"was where I lived, to where I worked, to where I",144
NA,"studied, to where I played sport and to where",144
NA,I undertook leisure activities. The key about,144
NA,more sustainable cities is not just better,144
NA,and better urban land use but it is,144
NA,also about integrating all of those areas of,144
NA,policy so that those key elements of people's,144
NA,lives are more within reach. We outlined an,144
NA,"agenda for that in the sustainability report,",144
NA,but I do not have the time to go through that.,144
NA,"I was pleased that our leader, Malcolm",144
NA,"Turnbull, was a part of that committee in its",144
NA,later incarnations and continues to highlight,144
NA,in the importance of these issues. But I am,144
NA,drawn to something that Victorian senator,144
NA,Kim Carr said. He said that if you do not,144
NA,have a minister for cities and a minister for,144
NA,urban development you are not for real. La-,144
NA,bor does not have a minister for cities and it,144
NA,does not have a minister for urban develop-,144
NA,ment. The opposition has a shadow minister,144
NA,"for sustainable development and cities and,",145
NA,"on the Kim Carr benchmark, the opposition",145
NA,is far more serious about taking the impor-,145
NA,"tant action, not just recognising the problems",145
NA,and the challenges but putting in place the,145
NA,sound public policy. I fear that this will,145
NA,be an area where Labor quickly identifies,145
NA,and secures the political opportunities and,145
NA,the sound bytes and leaves the sound public,145
NA,policy and hard work to others. The coalition,145
NA,is up to that task; we have the policies and,145
NA,they will be revealed-(Time expired),145
Mr ZAPPIA ,Makin) (9.25 pm)-I begin,145
NA,by commending the member for Kingston,145
NA,for bringing this matter to the attention of,145
NA,House. I certainly will not use up the few,145
NA,minutes that I have responding to everything,145
NA,"that was said by members opposite, but I",145
NA,noticed the member for Dunkley talked,145
NA,about the record of this government when it,145
NA,comes urban planning and I think it is like,145
NA,chalk and cheese when you compare it with,145
NA,the previous government. I want to specifi-,145
NA,cally respond to something the member for,145
NA,Mayo said when he made some references to,145
NA,the state planning minister in South Austra-,145
NA,"lia, the Hon. Paul Holloway. Paul Holloway",145
NA,is in fact a very highly regarded and very,145
NA,competent planning minister and one who is,145
NA,held in the utmost respect by most of the,145
NA,developers and the people involved in plan-,145
NA,ning in South Australia.,145
NA,I should also say that when it comes to the,145
NA,"Hills Face area of South Australia, which is a",145
NA,very unique area and one that is of concern,145
NA,"to a lot of South Australians, it was in fact",145
NA,"Jay Wetherill, the planning minister prior to",145
NA,"Paul Holloway, who implemented a freeze",145
NA,on planning and development in the Hills,145
NA,Face zone until a comprehensive community,145
NA,plan was developed for all of the Hills Face,145
NA,"area. So, again, when it came to protecting",145
NA,"our very valuable Hills Face area, it took a",145
NA,Labor government in South Australia to do,145
NA,that.,145
NA,I would like to make a number of observa-,145
NA,tions with respect to this resolution. The first,145
NA,is that good planning is often taken for,145
NA,granted and sufficient recognition is not,145
NA,given to the importance that it plays in the,145
NA,again lives of people. Planning can have a very,145
NA,profound effect on the quality of the lives of,145
NA,"people who live in any community, because",145
NA,"that is where they spend their lives, it is",145
NA,where they interact with others and it is,145
NA,"where their children attend school, sport and",145
NA,"other activities. As a consequence, a person's",145
NA,life is very much influenced by the people,145
NA,they associate with. Local communities ef-,145
NA,the fectively become an extension of one's own,145
NA,home. You can often become very attached,145
NA,"to your local community, as we see fre-",145
NA,quently from the fact that people will live in,145
NA,the same area for pretty much all of their,145
NA,lives. And if you look at the statistics you,145
NA,will see that of those people who do move,145
NA,the majority do not move very far away from,145
NA,the original suburban area or community,145
NA,they grew up in. So it is a fact of life that the,145
NA,local community and the planning that goes,145
NA,into it can truly affect the quality of a per-,145
NA,son's life and the opportunities that are pre-,145
NA,"sented to them. Sometimes, regrettably, as a",145
NA,result of poor planning rather than a lack of,145
NA,"opportunities, a person will find themselves",145
NA,in a situation where they are confronted by,145
NA,some very negative forces. Time will not,145
NA,permit me to elaborate on that but perhaps on,145
NA,another occasion I will.,145
NA,So good local area planning does make a,145
NA,drastic difference to the individual lives of,145
NA,"people, to the environment, which we have",145
NA,"heard other speakers talk about, and to the",145
NA,economic opportunities presented both to the,145
NA,individual and to the community as a whole.,145
NA,"Critically, the areas of health and education",145
NA,outcomes can very much become reliant on,145
NA,good planning and good development. In,145
NA,recent times the term ‘sustainable communi-,145
NA,ties' has often been used; it is an expression,145
NA,you hear quite frequently when you talk to,146
NA,"planners. Conversely, governments around",146
NA,the world are now expending large sums of,146
NA,money rectifying and rebuilding poorly,146
NA,planned communities of earlier years. We,146
NA,have some good examples of that in South,146
NA,"Australia, where the state government today",146
NA,is having to expend hundred of millions of,146
NA,dollars in order to rectify and rebuild com-,146
NA,munities that were built some 50 years ago,146
NA,and not properly planned out.,146
NA,One of the sad things that I hear too often,146
NA,is that there ought to be more land released,146
NA,for the purpose of building new homes. It is,146
NA,a view promoted by a number of housing,146
NA,developers. The problem with that is that,146
NA,housing developers may be very good at,146
NA,building houses but they are not necessarily,146
NA,"so good at building communities, and there",146
NA,is a difference. Having a nice house without,146
NA,"access to schools, shops, hospitals, sports",146
NA,"clubs, parks, community hubs, universities,",146
NA,workplaces and so on can very much add to,146
NA,the cost of living and can lead to a much,146
NA,poorer quality of life for those people who,146
NA,live there. It is true that not all services,146
NA,ever be available in every community. But,146
NA,that is why transport systems have to be de-,146
NA,"signed from the very outset. However, I ac-",146
NA,cept that long-term area planning can never,146
NA,be perfect. (Time expired),146

NA,These fine Australians and their fellow,147
NA,brigade members are our heroes. At a mo-,147
NA,"ment's notice, they regularly put their lives",147
NA,on the line to help people who they may not,147
NA,know to defend and save property that they,147
NA,do not own for a common bond that is,147
NA,uniquely Australian. This has been borne out,147
NA,in fighting fires not just across the region and,147
NA,not just across the state of New South Wales,147
NA,but indeed across all of Australia. They are,147
NA,"not paid for their personal sacrifices, but they",147
NA,are truly respected and admired for them. To,147
NA,"them and their families I, on behalf of this",147
NA,"parliament, say thank you on a job well",147
NA,done. You serve your community and you,147
NA,serve your nation very well indeed.,147
NA,Delegation to Dharamsala,147
Mr DANBY ,Melbourne Ports) (9.34,147
NA,pm)-At the end of next week when the,147
NA,"House rises for the winter break, I will have",147
NA,the great privilege of leading the first Austra-,147
NA,"lian parliamentary delegation to Dharamsala,",147
NA,in India. This is the seat of the Tibetan gov-,147
NA,"ernment in exile, headed by His Holiness the",147
NA,"Dalai Lama, who will be celebrating his 74th",147
NA,"birthday. The delegation will consist of me,",147
NA,"the honourable member for Fremantle, the",147
NA,"honourable member for Fisher, Senator Lud-",147
NA,"lam, Senator Hanson-Young and Senator",147
NA,Xenophon. I must stress at the outset that this,147
NA,will not be an official parliamentary delega-,147
NA,tion. We will not be representing the parlia-,147
NA,"ment, the government, the opposition or even",147
NA,our political parties. The all party parliamen-,147
NA,"tary group for Tibet, which I chair, is not",147
NA,even an official parliamentary group. In a,147
NA,"parliamentary sense, we will be representing",147
NA,only ourselves. But we will also be repre-,148
NA,senting a very large number of Australians of,148
NA,all political persuasions who care about the,148
NA,freedom and human rights of oppressed na-,148
NA,tionalities.,148
NA,"Ever since the Chinese invasion of 1950,",148
NA,the people of Tibet have been denied not,148
NA,only their national independence but also the,148
NA,freedom to practise their culture and relig-,148
NA,ion-although I acknowledge that the situa-,148
NA,tion has improved somewhat since the dark,148
NA,days of the Cultural Revolution in China.,148
NA,"Yet, as we saw during the extensive distur-",148
NA,"bances in Tibet last year, the people of that",148
NA,country-particularly the younger genera-,148
NA,tion-have not lost their desire for national,148
NA,and personal freedom. It is estimated that,148
NA,"there are up to 500,000 Chinese troops in",148
NA,"Tibet, a region with a Tibetan population of",148
NA,only two million people-although there are,148
NA,five million Tibetans who live in wider areas,148
NA,of the People's Republic of China. There has,148
NA,been a systematic effort to settle Tibet with,148
NA,Han Chinese migrants in the hope of swamp-,148
NA,ing the Tibetans and extinguishing their cul-,148
NA,ture.,148
NA,"In Dharamsala, we will be meeting with",148
NA,"the Dalai Lama, who is recognised by all",148
NA,"Tibetans, inside and outside Tibet, as their",148
NA,national and spiritual leader. We will also,148
NA,"meeting Professor Samdong Rinpoche, the",148
NA,Prime Minister of the Tibetan government in,148
NA,"exile, who was elected by the world commu-",148
NA,nity of Tibetans in exile.,148
NA,I know that the Chinese Embassy in Aus-,148
NA,tralia told the Age last week that they had,148
NA,opposed our delegation's visit to Dharamsala,148
NA,as it would be an interference in Chinese,148
NA,sovereignty because we are supporting Ti-,148
NA,betan independence. Let me say to this,148
NA,"House, as I have said to successive Chinese",148
NA,ambassadors: I am not anti China. This dele-,148
NA,gation's visit to India is in no way an act,148
NA,hostility towards China. I wish nothing but,148
NA,happiness and prosperity for the great Chi-,148
NA,"nese people. But, just as the Chinese people",148
NA,fought for many decades to free their country,148
NA,of foreign invaders and to re-establish their,148
NA,"sovereignty, I hope our Chinese friends",148
NA,would understand that the people of Tibet,148
NA,wish to do the same for their country. There,148
NA,are 1.2 billion people in China. I find it hard,148
NA,to understand why they feel it necessary to,148
NA,deny self-government to a minority popula-,148
NA,tion of only five million in a remote area of,148
NA,their vast country. Many Chinese feel that,148
NA,they liberated Tibet from feudalism and they,148
NA,cannot understand why the Tibetans are not,148
NA,grateful for that. I am not here to defend the,148
NA,"system that operated before 1950, but the",148
NA,Chinese themselves do not welcome changes,148
NA,"brought to China by foreigners, even if those",148
NA,foreigners are well intentioned.,148
NA,"When I was at university, I studied Marx-",148
NA,"ism under a great professor, Dr Frank",148
NA,"Knopfelmacher, who insisted that we read",148
NA,Das Kapital and the even more turgid Die,148
NA,Grundrisse. In those studies I learnt that one,148
NA,of the basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism is,148
NA,"atheism, which is the official state ideology",148
NA,of China. It is very odd that a country with,148
NA,such an ideology would insist on appointing,148
NA,the spiritual second-in-command of the Dalai,148
NA,be Lama's religion. The Panchen Lama-the,148
NA,authentic one-was ‘disappeared' by agents,148
NA,of the Beijing regime when he was five years,148
NA,old. That is now many years ago.,148
NA,The Dalai Lama has said that he accepts,148
NA,the Chinese assertion that China has histori-,148
NA,cally exercised sovereignty over Tibet-,148
NA,although I note in passing that many histori-,148
NA,ans in Tibet dispute this-and that he is will-,148
NA,ing to accept the same autonomous status,148
NA,that China has accepted for Hong Kong and,148
NA,Macau. I have to say that this seems a re-,148
NA,"markably moderate position, given the sad",148
NA,of history of oppression in Tibet since 1950. I,148
NA,hope that the Chinese leadership will eventu-,148
NA,ally have the wisdom to accept the Dalai,148
NA,"Lama's proposal, although I do not expect it",149
NA,to happen soon.,149
NA,Some people say to me that Tibet is a lost,149
NA,cause. My reply is that I am old enough to,149
NA,"have seen the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end",149
NA,"of apartheid, the demise of fascism in Spain",149
NA,and Communism in the Soviet Union and the,149
NA,establishment of independence in East,149
NA,Timor. I do not believe that any just cause is,149
NA,truly lost. The cause of the people of Tibet is,149
NA,a just case and one that I am proud to sup-,149
NA,port.,149
NA,Hinkler Electorate: Hervey Bay,149
Mr NEVILLE ,Hinkler) (9.39 pm)-,149
NA,"During the 2007 election, I campaigned on a",149
NA,commitment to secure $1.5 million to help,149
NA,build the much needed community centre for,149
NA,the fast growing city of Hervey Bay in my,149
NA,electorate. If ever there was a project that,149
NA,"cried out to heaven for completion, it is this",149
NA,one. It is hard to believe that a city,149
NA,"people does not already have a centre, but",149
NA,new infrastructure is actually the biggest so-,149
NA,cial challenge that Hervey Bay faces at the,149
NA,moment. It has grown like topsy and contin-,149
NA,ues to grow. Assistance from state and fed-,149
NA,eral governments with infrastructure is criti-,149
NA,"cal. Unfortunately, Labor failed to match my",149
NA,"commitment to the project, and it seems that",149
NA,the government has followed through by re-,149
NA,jecting a regional community and local infra-,149
NA,structure program funding application for,149
NA,"this project. In fact, my opponent at the last",149
NA,federal election would not even commit to it.,149
NA,"On Friday, 22 May, I heard from the pro-",149
NA,"ponents, who were absolutely devastated that",149
NA,their high-quality application had been,149
NA,knocked back by the federal government.,149
NA,This project has a considerable history. Prior,149
NA,to the local government amalgamations in,149
NA,"Queensland, Hervey Bay City Council com-",149
NA,mitted $1 million and land to the project-a,149
NA,commitment later reaffirmed by the newly,149
NA,amalgamated Fraser Coast Regional Council.,149
NA,The Queensland government also made $1.5,149
NA,"million available to the project, and many",149
NA,service clubs in town have been actively,149
NA,fundraising for it. All that was missing was,149
NA,the Commonwealth contribution under the,149
NA,RLCIP criteria. The project fitted that criteria,149
NA,beautifully. The community centre would,149
NA,have been a hub for a number of social ser-,149
NA,"vices for children and youth, as well as coun-",149
NA,"selling, mentoring and referral services and",149
NA,other information outlets. These would be,149
NA,delivered by semi-government organisations,149
NA,and NGOs. The proponents had already de-,149
NA,"veloped a plan for construction, costs were",149
NA,completed and two weeks ago the building,149
NA,permit was lodged. This is a shovel-ready,149
NA,project. It is an environmentally keen project,149
NA,with a six-star rating. This would have,149
NA,helped to create jobs in Hervey Bay while,149
NA,also providing much needed civic infrastruc-,149
NA,ture. It has now been left high and dry due to,149
NA,"of 50,000 some bureaucratic decision.",149
NA,When we talk about vibrant regional,149
NA,"communities, of course a robust local com-",149
NA,munity is important. But what is also impor-,149
NA,tant in towns and cities are good places for,149
NA,"people to live, where residents can enjoy",149
NA,"quality of life and, if they fall into difficul-",149
NA,"ties, be referred to proper services. One thing",149
NA,that is desperately needed in Hervey Bay is a,149
NA,community centre-a place where people,149
NA,"can come together for assistance, support and",149
NA,guidance. I have spoken to a number of peo-,149
NA,ple about the funding knock-back and have,149
NA,given them an assurance that I will seek fur-,149
NA,ther information from the minister and the,149
NA,parliamentary secretary and that I will con-,149
NA,tinue to fight to get Commonwealth funding.,149
NA,I put on the record the position that the,149
NA,"community finds itself in, thanks to this de-",149
NA,cision. These words are direct quotes from a,149
NA,local resident-they are not mine. They,149
NA,state:,149
NA,"Presently, services in our community are deliv-",150
NA,"ered in a hodge-podge of inaccessible facilities,",150
NA,some of which are of asbestos laden.,150
NA,Some people have access to emergency relief and,150
NA,"others confidential services in parking lots, be-",150
NA,cause they cannot fiscally get into a facility.,150
NA,"services are forced to pay commercial scale rents,",150
NA,directly impacting on the level of service avail-,150
NA,"able to the homeless, the aged, challenged fami-",150
NA,lies and other targeted consumers.,150
NA,In a community that has almost nothing; where,150
NA,"jobs are few and far between at the best of times,",150
NA,we stand to lose in excess of $2.5 million funding,150
NA,and a valuable community asset because the,150
NA,Commonwealth would not partner with us on this,150
NA,project.,150
NA,As news of this poor decision becomes publicly,150
NA,"known, people in our community will be justifia-",150
NA,bly outraged.,150
NA,"Bearing these words in mind, I urge the min-",150
NA,"ister and the parliamentary secretary, who I",150
NA,might say have been very good to me to this,150
NA,"point, to support this project and do the right",150
NA,thing for the people of Hervey Bay.,150
NA,Petition: Coral Sea Heritage Park,150
Mr TURNOUR ,Leichhardt) (9.44 pm)-,150
NA,I rise tonight to present a petition approved,150
NA,by the Standing Committee on Petitions. The,150
NA,petition has been organised by Mr Wayne,150
NA,"Bayne, Mr Robert Erskine and other con-",150
NA,"cerned citizens, who have since established",150
NA,the Coral Sea Access Alliance Group to,150
NA,campaign against the establishment of the,150
NA,Coral Sea Heritage Park as proposed by the,150
NA,Pew Environment Group. The Pew Envi-,150
NA,ronment Group's proposal would effectively,150
NA,ban fishing and a range of other uses in more,150
NA,than one million square kilometres of the,150
NA,"Coral Sea. There have been 2,053 signatures",150
NA,collected in support of this petition. They are,150
NA,not in a format that allows them to be tabled,150
NA,tonight but I do have them here in my hand.,150
NA,Nine hundred signatures were collected in,150
NA,"one night at a meeting I attended in Cairns,",150
NA,organised by Mr Bayne and local fishers.,150
NA,The Pew Coral Sea Heritage Park would,150
NA,effectively ban fishing in an area bordered by,150
NA,the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and our,150
NA,"maritime border with PNG, the Solomon Is-",150
NA,"lands and New Caledonia. This, as I said, is",150
NA,Other an area of more than one million square kilo-,150
NA,metres of sea. The petition raises concerns,150
NA,about government actions ‘that will result in,150
NA,"any usage restrictions, access or additional",150
NA,controls over the area known as the Coral,150
NA,Sea beyond those that exist under current,150
NA,legislation'.,150
NA,I have discussed the Pew proposal with a,150
NA,broad cross-section of the community and,150
NA,"representative groups, including recreational",150
NA,"and professional fishers, tourism representa-",150
NA,"tives, the Super Yacht Group and environ-",150
NA,mental groups. This is a large and broad,150
NA,cross-section of local stakeholders and inter-,150
NA,"est groups, as well as many members of the",150
NA,local community. The vast majority of peo-,150
NA,ple see the Pew proposal as extreme and an,150
NA,ambit claim to lock up the Coral Sea. I share,150
NA,this view and have discussed this with the,150
NA,"Minister for the Environment, Heritage and",150
NA,"the Arts, the Hon. Peter Garrett. Sadly, the",150
NA,Pew proposal has divided the community,150
NA,and has sought to pre-empt a bioregional,150
NA,planning process being undertaken by the,150
NA,Australian government.,150
NA,"Since the petition was established, the en-",150
NA,vironment minister has released the biore-,150
NA,gional plan for the area and established a,150
NA,conservation zone covering the Coral Sea. I,150
NA,sought to ensure that any conservation zon-,150
NA,ing while the bioregional planning is pro-,150
NA,ceeding would not impact on fishers in the,150
NA,Coral Sea. I am pleased that the minister has,150
NA,ensured that this has happened. The Pew,150
NA,group have not got their no-take zone and I,150
NA,will continue to fight any such proposal. Ex-,150
NA,isting tourism operators and other commer-,150
NA,cial users of the area will have to obtain free,150
NA,permits to continue operating. Concerns,150
NA,about this permit process have been raised,150

NA,and I will be raising these with the minister.,151
NA,"Yes, the government is moving forward",151
NA,"with its bioregional planning process, includ-",151
NA,ing consultations on whether there needs to,151
NA,"be increased protection in the area, but no",151
NA,final decision has been made. People do rec-,151
NA,ognise that this is a valuable and important,151
NA,area and that there are areas that need to be,151
NA,"protected, but we need to work through a",151
NA,"proper process, which is what the Australian",151
NA,government is doing. I will continue working,151
NA,to ensure that fishing and other interests are,151
NA,"considered in this process, as I did prior to",151
NA,the announcement of the conservation zone.,151
NA,There are consultation meetings in Cairns,151
NA,today and tomorrow as part of the biore-,151
NA,gional planning process. This petition high-,151
NA,lights concerns about government consulta-,151
NA,tion processes when it comes to environ-,151
NA,mental issues and seeks to ensure that any,151
NA,consultations be ‘conducted transparently,151
NA,and not purely for the purpose of fulfilling a,151
NA,bureaucratic requirement'. In many ways,151
NA,"people seem cynical about consultations, but",151
NA,it is very important that we do engage prop-,151
NA,erly with the community about this process. I,151
NA,am committed to that. I can assure petition-,151
NA,ers that I will be following with considerable,151
NA,interest these consultations and will continue,151
NA,to raise any issues and concerns with the,151
NA,minister.,151
NA,"Finally, the petition raises concerns about",151
NA,"foreign based groups-in this case, Pew-",151
NA,instigating Australian environmental policy. I,151
NA,can assure petitioners that the Pew Environ-,151
NA,"ment Group, funded out of the United States,",151
NA,is not in control of environmental planning in,151
NA,Australia. The bioregional planning process,151
NA,was instigated and begun under the former,151
NA,"Howard government, following the estab-",151
NA,lishment of the Environment Protection and,151
NA,Biodiversity Conservation Act. The Rudd,151
NA,government is moving forward with this bio-,151
NA,regional planning and I would encourage all,151
NA,those with an interest in the Coral Sea to en-,151
NA,gage in the consultation processes construc-,151
NA,"tively. I congratulate Mr Bayne, Mr Erskine",151
NA,"and all of the 2,053 people who have signed",151
NA,these petitions in support for actively partici-,151
NA,pating in our Australian democracy. I look,151
NA,forward to the parliament's response to this,151
NA,petition.,151
NA,The petition read as follows-,151
NA,To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of,151
NA,the House of Representatives,151
NA,This petition of the citizens of Australia.,151
NA,Draws to the attention of the House:,151
NA,Our concern over any possible actions by any,151
NA,"government departments, ministers or govern-",151
NA,ment authorities that will result in any usage re-,151
NA,"strictions, access, or additional controls over the",151
NA,area known as The Coral Sea beyond those that,151
NA,exist under current legislation. We express con-,151
NA,siderable concern over several aspects of the,151
NA,PEW Foundation's proposal to establish the Coral,151
NA,Sea Heritage Park and demand that this proposal,151
NA,be dismissed immediately in its entirety. Public,151
NA,consultations on previous environmental issues,151
NA,have been extremely poorly advertised with little,151
NA,concern for the public opinions expressed.,151
NA,We therefore ask the House to:,151
NA,That any proposed environmental policies in Aus-,151
NA,tralia be instigated by Australian organisations,151
NA,and that Australian environmental policy be under,151
NA,the control of a duly elected Australian Govern-,151

Mr LINDSAY ,Herbert) (9.49 pm)-I am,151
NA,pleased that the member for Leichhardt has,151
NA,raised this issue tonight and I would like to,151
NA,add my contribution in relation to it. I have,151
NA,long been on the public record calling for the,151
NA,expansion of the Great Barrier Reef Marine,152
NA,Park to cover further coral reefs in that area.,152
NA,I have been particularly concerned about the,152
NA,impact on the shark fishery in that area. That,152
NA,is where there have been some very signifi-,152
NA,cant adverse effects from unscrupulous fish-,152
NA,"ers, and the shark population should be better",152
NA,protected. I am hoping that will be an out-,152
NA,come of the current government's process in,152
NA,relation to the Coral Sea.,152
NA,Tonight I want to raise the issue of how,152
NA,Townsville people have been done in the eye,152
NA,by the Rudd government and I will give sev-,152
NA,eral examples. The member for Blair will,152
NA,know that I have Australia's largest defence,152
NA,"base in my electorate, and we have had this",152
NA,conversation previously. I may bring 9 FSB,152
NA,"up to Townsville, sir, so watch out!",152
NA,Standing at Lavarack Barracks on 12 No-,152
NA,"vember 2007, the current Prime Minister",152
NA,promised to increase defence spending by at,152
NA,least three per cent real annually to 2016. He,152
NA,said:,152
NA,"We believe that those in uniform, our men",152
NA,women in uniform who serve our country with,152
NA,distinction deserve that level of certainty …,152
NA,Yet the heart of Labor's Pappas review into,152
NA,defence was to slash spending. In the 2009-,152
NA,"10 budget, Defence has been required to",152
NA,make $20 billion worth of savings over 10,152
NA,years. It is a case of the Rudd government,152
NA,giving with one hand and then taking back,152
NA,with the other.,152
NA,"Then there is the other broken promise,",152
NA,which was particularly felt in my electorate,152
NA,"of Herbert, where the Prime Minister and the",152
NA,shadow minister for defence at the time indi-,152
NA,cated that the first of the new family medical,152
NA,centres that Labor were promising would be,152
NA,"opened in both Townsville and Darwin. Well,",152
NA,neither Townsville nor Darwin has received a,152
NA,family medical centre but other centres have.,152
NA,It is a clear broken promise in relation to the,152
NA,Australian Defence Force.,152
NA,Look at the promise of the national broad-,152
NA,band network. In March 2001 Mr Rudd said:,152
NA,We're proposing to invest up to $4.7 billion in,152
NA,this proposal …,152
NA,Mr Rudd also promised that it would be,152
NA,commenced in late 2008. Now there is a new,152
NA,"plan, and the new plan will not cost $4.7 bil-",152
NA,lion but $43 billion. The promise was that,152
NA,construction would commence by late,152
NA,2008-yet another broken promise. There,152
NA,has been no construction commenced and we,152
NA,will not likely see any construction for some,152
NA,"time. My community of Magnetic Island,",152
NA,"near Townsville, is not even going to be cov-",152
NA,ered by the national broadband network.,152
NA,That is quite extraordinary for a community,152
NA,like Magnetic Island.,152
NA,"In relation to roads, the Douglas arterial",152
NA,received $55 million to become four lanes in,152
NA,the budget before last. Do you know how,152
NA,much work has been done on that four-laning,152
NA,project? None. We do not even know when it,152
NA,might start. The ring road is finished but the,152
NA,"and four-laning of the Douglas arterial, which",152
NA,was to take the extra volume of traffic gener-,152
NA,"ated by the ring road, does not even have a",152
NA,"commencement date at this stage, yet it is",152
NA,supposed to be and is touted as being a na-,152
NA,tion-building project. How can it be a nation-,152
NA,building project if it is not being built?,152
NA,"In relation to private health insurance, in a",152
NA,letter to the Australian Health Insurance As-,152
NA,"sociation on 20 November 2007, Kevin Rudd",152
NA,said:,152
NA,Federal Labor is committed to retaining the exist-,152
NA,ing private health insurance rebates.,152
NA,Never was an election promise given so em-,152
NA,phatically and then broken so brazenly. It has,152
NA,had such a terrible flow-on into the public,152
NA,hospital system and the private hospital sys-,152
NA,"tem in Townsville, but that is another story",152
NA,for another day. On ABC TV on Wednesday,152
NA,"night the Prime Minister, under pressure",152
NA,from unions wanting the abolition of the,152
NA,Australian Building and Construction Com-,153
NA,"missioner, was very quick to say:",153
NA,We will be adhering to our pre-election commit-,153
NA,ment. I take absolutely seriously my commitment,153
NA,to the Australian people prior to the last,153
NA,I just wish he would ‘take absolutely seri-,153
NA,ously' all of his other commitments. Labor,153
NA,keep election promises when it suits them,153
NA,and break them when it does not. The Aus-,153
NA,tralian people cannot ever again trust what,153
NA,the Australian Labor Party tells them.,153
NA,Mr Herbert Morton Olm,153
Mr NEUMANN ,Blair) (9.54 pm)-I am,153
NA,speaking tonight about a remarkable individ-,153
NA,ual. His name is Herbert Morton Olm. He,153
NA,was born at Ropeley in the Lockyer Valley,153
NA,on 7 August 1908. He is still with us. He is a,153
NA,much loved and respected and popular figure,153
NA,in the Laidley Tabeel aged-care home. Until,153
NA,recently he lived on the family farm at Rope-,153
NA,ley with the support of his family. His grand-,153
NA,son Joshua works for me as an electorate,153
NA,officer and is the treasurer of my branch of,153
NA,"the ALP, the Raceview Flinders branch in",153
NA,Ipswich.,153
NA,Herb is an interesting character. Herb,153
NA,joined the Labor Party in 1930. He would,153
NA,have joined earlier but in Queensland at that,153
NA,stage you had to wait until you were 21 to,153
NA,join the Labor Party. In Queensland now you,153
NA,can join the Labor Party at 15 years of age.,153
NA,He was made a life member of the party in,153
NA,"1978. In 1936 he married the love of his life,",153
NA,"Maud, and they were blessed with eight chil-",153
NA,dren and many grandchildren and great-,153
NA,grandchildren. He was appointed a Justice of,153
NA,"the Peace in 1934, one of only three in Gat-",153
NA,"ton at the time, and he is Queensland's long-",153
NA,est serving JP. The most remarkable thing,153
NA,about his life is this: he lived all his life in,153
NA,"the Lockyer Valley, which has always been a",153
NA,fairly conservative area. It is part of my elec-,153
NA,torate but traditionally it has voted conserva-,153
NA,tive. He has been involved in many coopera-,153
NA,tive and society activities in the Lockyer Val-,153
NA,"ley and is a Lockyer legend. In fact, the for-",153
NA,mer conservative state member for Lockyer,153
NA,described him as a one of the 10 most impor-,153
NA,election. tant people in the Lockyer Valley.,153
NA,One of the most interesting things about,153
NA,Herb is that in 1960 he managed to convince,153
NA,a very young police officer called Bill Hay-,153
NA,den that he should run for the seat of Oxley.,153
NA,Oxley was created in 1949 and held by the,153
NA,"then health minister, Don Cameron. Oxley",153
NA,"had existed before, but it had been renamed",153
NA,Griffith in 1934. But it had never been held,153
NA,by the Labor Party. Bill won it with a re-,153
NA,markable swing of 9.4 per cent. Herb took,153
NA,nine months off from the family farm to go,153
NA,full-time campaigning with Bill Hayden.,153
NA,Herb wrote many speeches. Bill was a young,153
NA,fellow and he had Dallas with him in an old,153
NA,car and they drove around all over the place.,153
NA,"Herb introduced Bill to many farmers, cat-",153
NA,tlemen and people involved in all kinds of,153
NA,activities in the Lockyer Valley.,153
NA,"On Herb's 100th birthday, Bill Hayden",153
NA,spoke movingly and brilliantly at the Gatton,153
NA,"Shire Hall. Many people were there, includ-",153
NA,"ing the Minister for Ageing, Justine Elliot.",153
NA,"There were messages from all and sundry,",153
NA,from political leaders and one from the,153
NA,Queen. The mayor of the Lockyer Valley,153
NA,"Regional Council was there, and I was hon-",153
NA,oured to be there among the 160 people. Bill,153
NA,attributed much of the swing that he got in,153
NA,1961 to Herb. He spoke almost tearfully,153
NA,about what Herb had done for him: the men-,153
NA,"toring, the advice, the counselling, the people",153
NA,Herb had introduced him to. His sage help,153
NA,was invaluable in Bill winning in 1961. I,153
NA,have Bill's old seat and it is very much as it,153
NA,"was in 1961, except I have got Boonah in-",153
NA,stead of Esk.,153
NA,People like Herb who have lived all their,153
NA,lives campaigning and being involved in,153
NA,community activities like Blue Care and,153
NA,many other voluntary things should be hon-,154
NA,oured. We should cherish them. People like,154
NA,Herb are not just an institution and a legend,154
NA,in the Lockyer Valley; they are to be admired,154
NA,and respected. His generation is a great gen-,154
NA,eration. His contribution to political life and,154
NA,community life in the Lockyer Valley cannot,154
NA,be underestimated. I want to pay tribute to,154
NA,Herb and thank him for his generational con-,154
NA,tribution: now his grandson is helping me,154
NA,and his family has been involved in helping,154
NA,run Labor Party campaigns and helping the,154
NA,cause of the labour movement for genera-,154
NA,"tions. Thank you, Herb, for the life you have",154
NA,lived. Thank you for what you have done for,154
NA,"me, Bill Hayden and all those people who",154
NA,hold the principles of the Labor Party and the,154
NA,"labour movement so dear. Well done, Herb.",154

Dr KELLY ,Eden-Monaro-Parliamentary,156
NA,tary Secretary for Water) (4.10 pm)-It is a,156
NA,knowledge the words of my colleague the,156
NA,points. Certainly we have seen this sort of,156
NA,leagues in coalition environments such as the,156
NA,as the CERP funds available to them-the,156

NA,"that we have been very interested in, which",177
NA,had the opportunity to ask the Deputy Prime Minister,177
NA,swers have been wholly inaccurate. What I,177
NA,go through some of the problems that are associated,177
NA,and get some sensible responses to how she feels,177
NA,will be able to address some of the cost increases,177
NA,certain sectors.,177
NA,I would like to start by referring to a letter,177
NA,owner just outside of my electorate in Shenton,177
NA,industry award. Under the award modernisation,177
NA,force working on a Sunday $39.48 per hour. So,177
NA,his casual workforce on a Sunday. He is a small,177
NA,that increase in wage costs. He says in his letter,177
NA,ual staff. He has asked us to try to do something,177
NA,will do so during the transitional bill in the,177
NA,how the minister responds to his queries and,177
NA,those staff once his costs base,177
NA,I want to put another few questions on the,177
NA,when the minister made the award modernisation,177
NA,Commission to do what most would consider,177
NA,program. I think everybody can see through,177
NA,drives these inaccurate claims.,177
NA,with the Australian people about this-when,177
NA,"to support jobs, from time to time there are",177
NA,and complaints. On each and every occasion that,177
NA,"to us we act on the basis of them. Of course,",177

NA,infrastructure for higher education. One bil-,177
NA,was the Better Universities Renewal Fund. (Exten-,177
NA,this one sentence and then we will move to other,177
NA,to do the same. With more than $5 billion,177
NA,"education and training infrastructure, I",177
NA,interesting to me that when called on to detail an,177
NA,I have not heard an education policy about early,177
NA,about school education. I have not heard an,177
NA,things like overcoming disadvantage in schools.,177
NA,the Bradley reforms. This is the problem for the,177
NA,but they are a policy-free zone. And the,177
NA,move on to another area within this portfolio,177
NA,is the area of award modernisation. When I have,177
NA,"questions about this in the past, her an-",177
NA,am hoping for is that we would have a chance to,177
NA,with the award modernisation process,177
NA,"that business, in particular small business,",177
NA,"that she is going to impose, particularly in",177
NA,that I received recently from a supermarket,177
NA,Park. He talks about the new general retail,177
NA,changes he will need to pay his casual work-,177
NA,that is almost $40 an hour he will need to pay,177
NA,supermarket owner; clearly he cannot sustain,177
NA,to us that he is going to have to shed his cas-,177
NA,about it through the legislative process. We,177
NA,"other place, but I would be very interested to hear",177
NA,what she thinks he can do to stop getting rid of,177
NA,has increased substantially.,177
NA,record for the minister to respond to. Clearly,177
NA,"requests, she asked the Industrial Relations",177
NA,"to be impossible-that is, to not disadvantage",177
NA,MAIN COMMITTEE,177
NA,employees but also to not increase the cost,178
NA,"with these sorts of issues, you are dealing",178
NA,"one and adding to the other, it is literally impossible",178
NA,"matter what the commission does, there is",178
NA,wishes and the request of the Deputy Prime Minister.,178
NA,any understanding about what this process entails.,178
NA,And so I ask the minister: does she stand,178
NA,vantaged and that her award modernisation process,178
NA,have asked her in this place before about advice,178
NA,"modernisation is going to do to the labour market,",178
NA,could share with House about what sort of information,178
NA,about how the award modernisation process,178
NA,"has not asked for such advice, then I would",178
NA,pretty basic aspect of due diligence when you,178
NA,like to know what she thinks will be the result,178
NA,are a small business owner and you are faced,178
NA,you could be operating on very tight profit,178
NA,these businesses to do?,178
NA,I also ask that isn't it the case that under,178
NA,phase-in period that she often talks about is,178
NA,to transition the new awards in? When we raise,178
NA,minister will always respond by talking about,178
NA,a reasonable option. The reality is of course,178
NA,ister does not have any power to direct them,178
NA,also ask the minister to guarantee that the transition,178
NA,"tralian job. Finally, I ask her why the jobs of",178
NA,the many other sectors that are going to be,178
NA,portant to her as those in restaurants and cafes.,178
NA,request to ask the commission to do a separate,178
NA,sector. Clearly that is an acknowledgement that,178
NA,she was faced with the evidence that those changes,178
NA,"within that industry, she varied the request.",178
Mr NEUMANN ,Blair) (5.49 pm)-I have a,178
NA,Education Revolution funding that relate to,178
NA,been the subject of some discussion and media notoriety.,178
NA,Mr Keenan-Can't you just ask her? You've,178
NA,utes.,178
Mr NEUMANN,"Unlike the member for Stirling,",178
NA,ate have warmly welcomed the funding. For,178
NA,School. Money for a multipurpose hall was repeatedly,178
NA,"coalition government. Well, the Rudd government",178
NA,School. I spoke at the assembly on Friday,178
NA,Three schools in my electorate of Blair,178
NA,the local and national media. The first is Bremer,178
NA,base for employers. Clearly when you are dealing,178
NA,in a zero sum game. If you are taking away from,178
NA,to implement that promise accurately. No,178
NA,really no chance that they could conform to the,178
NA,I think that is clear to anyone who has,178
NA,by her promise that no employee will be disad-,178
NA,will not increase the cost to business? I,178
NA,that she has received about what the award,178
NA,and I would be interested in any advice she,178
NA,she has received from her department,178
NA,is going to impact on the labour market. If she,178
NA,"ask why she has not, as that would seem like a",178
NA,are making such a major change. I would also,178
NA,of these massive increases in wage costs. If you,178
NA,"with a substantial increase in your wage costs,",178

NA,"the five-year phase-in period, which in itself is",178

NA,The other school is Dinmore State School.,179

NA,tively purchasing the site to become part,179
NA,relocated and a new school is being built at,179
NA,school and I look forward to it being opened.,179
NA,I seek the minister's comments in relation,179
NA,"those opposite. In fact, Dr Bruce Flegg, the",179
NA,"sland, described funding for schools in Ipswich",179
NA,"ter's comments in relation to Bremer,",179
Ms GILLARD ,"Lalor-Minister for Education,",179
NA,Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion),179
NA,have been put to me. The response to the question,179
NA,"ment and workplace relations is, I think, very",179
NA,reform with award modernisation. I know that,179
NA,safety nets. That was represented by its Work,179
NA,safety net could be stripped away apart from,179
NA,"them up to the light, did not guarantee much",179
NA,the Liberal Party's ethos because it believes,179

NA,Minister for Employment and Workplace,179
NA,(5.53 pm)-I will respond to the questions that,179
NA,asked by the shadow minister for employ-,179

NA,the Liberal Party does not really believe in,179
NA,"Choices legislation, where all aspects of the",179
NA,"five minimum conditions which, when you held",179
NA,at all. So I know that safety nets are not part of,179
NA,in statutory individual employment agreements,179
NA,MAIN COMMITTEE,179
NA,"that can strip the safety net away. But, even",180
NA,Liberal Party used to pretend that it was interested,180
NA,modernising awards. It had a few goes at it,180
NA,reform is not an easy thing to do. It is an,180
NA,members opposite do that from time to time-but,180
NA,"Remarkably, this government, in pushing",180
NA,Industrial Relations Commission and working,180
NA,working through them very well. If the shadow,180

NA,of new modern awards. The level of stakeholder,180
NA,level of stakeholder acceptance of them once,180
NA,"might, therefore, want to congratulate the Australian",180
NA,work at some point.,180
NA,The shadow minister points to some areas,180
NA,of the government has been clear: we have been,180
NA,to them as necessary. I have varied the award,180
NA,sion. That is because I have responded to concerns,180
NA,variation and to concerns from employer stakeholders,180
NA,area that he raised. We are still in a process,180
NA,other areas that he raised.,180
NA,The shadow minister refuses to acknowledge,180

NA,ments. Many employer stakeholders are there,180

Ms JACKSON ,Hasluck) (7.00 pm)-I find,193
NA,moted by the shadow minister for immigration,193
NA,has put forward. It is predicated on a number,193
NA,facts. One could argue perhaps that this is not,193
NA,offers no policy direction for the future and,193
NA,views about how ministerial intervention,193
NA,At least she was accurate in the part where,193
NA,to members of the Migration Review Tribunal,193
NA,about his concerns regarding the use of section,193

NA,provides no clue as to the shadow minister's own,193
NA,powers are and should be used.,193
NA,she quoted from the Hon. Chris Evans' speech,193
NA,and Refugee Review Tribunal when he talked,193

NA,"very much when he first became the minister, be-",193

NA,commonplace in individual cases and that there,193
NA,MAIN COMMITTEE,193
NA,had been a substantial expansion in requests,194
NA,"that in 2006-07 over 4,000 requests for ministerial",194

NA,handled only 81 applications for the exercise,194
NA,"three years as minister, handled 311 and Philip",194

NA,"there is an expectation now that, as a matter",194
NA,nue for any individual to pursue their application,194
NA,"complaint to the minister, which is quite a",194
NA,"other concern, which he clearly raised, was that",194
NA,"of intervention. Indeed, I am",194
NA,Let us say the minister for social security,194

NA,Treasurer. If I did not like my Australian Taxation,194
NA,such extraordinary powers? These powers are,194
NA,cumstances such as in the nation's security.,194
NA,it is appropriate in circumstances for the minister,194
NA,one thing to be exercising them in terms of,194
NA,in my opinion; it is quite another thing when,194

NA,report to restore the integrity and transparency,194

NA,Let us be clear on this. There is no question that,196
NA,minister I will exercise them in,196

NA,Another thing that I think is really important,210

NA,cated to the elimination of all deaths in Australia,210
NA,"about this, as do all members of the parliament",210
NA,would like to commend the member for Blair,210

NA,ever allow me to fully relax or not be there,210
NA,much more vulnerable to drowning than adults.,210
NA,"of their depth can cause them to panic, and their",210
NA,when under pressure. The point is that when,210
NA,relax.,210
NA,I note that in this motion there are a number,210
NA,about first aid and safety training laws and,210
NA,absolutely support the concept of an awareness,210

NA,local government are effective. The pool and,210

NA,"fine work that is done by surf lifesaving clubs,",210
NA,in patrolling the beaches and preventing,210

NA,to be taught to swim and they need to be taught,210
NA,"the pool, at least they can get themselves to the",210
NA,I think it is really important that access to,210
NA,because it will save our community a lot,210
NA,is absolutely no doubt that we are all dedi-,210

NA,who are parents or responsible adults. So I,210
NA,for raising this important issue and allowing us,210

NA,about the adult supervision from other parents.,210
NA,over the last two weeks. She went for her,210

NA,to knowing where your child is at all times.,211
NA,drowning of children can and does occur in places,211
NA,tub is an example of where supervision of young,211

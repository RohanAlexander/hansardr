Bill read a first time. Second Reading",17
4,Ms MACKLIN ,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (12.03 pm)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill implements key elements of the government's secure and sustainable pension reform package announced in the 2009 budget. This reform package addresses the adequacy of the pension, makes its operation simpler and more responsive to pensioner needs, and secures its long-term sustainability. It prepares Australia to meet future challenges, including the ageing population, through amendments to social security, famAssent ily assistance, veterans' affairs and aged-care legislation. In addition to providing significant increases in pensions, the reforms will make the pension system simpler, fairer and more flexible. Australia's 3.3 million age pensioners, disability pensioners, carers, wife and widow B pensioners, bereavement allowance, special needs pension and veteran income support recipients will benefit from increases in their pension payments. The pension reform measures in this bill implement the reforms to social security and aged-care laws. A further bill, to be introduced at a later date, will deliver the pension reform measures for veterans and their dependants. Most of the pension reforms, including the important pension increases, will be introduced from 20 September 2009. Other measures will commence on the dates as specified. Increased pension payments From 20 September 2009, the secure and sustainable pension reforms will deliver total increases of $32.49 a week for singles who receive the maximum rate of pension, and $10.14 a week combined for couples on the maximum rate. These increases are on top of regular indexation due in September. The total increase will comprise a rise in the base rate for single pensioners and a new, and increased, pension supplement for all pensioners. This increase brings the single rate of pension up to two-thirds of the combined couple rate. The maximum base rate of the pension payable to single people will be increased by $30 a week. In addition, singles will receive an increase of $2.49 a week in the new pension supplement, bringing their total increase to $32.49 a week. The $10.14 a week increase for couples combined will be provided through the new pension supplement. These increases are on top of all existing pensions and allowances. Following these reforms, the new total weekly pension plus supplement will be an estimated $336.68 for singles and $507.50 for couples combined. This amounts to $17,507.36 a year for singles, and $26,390.00 for couples combined. The actual figures to apply from 20 September will depend on indexation. Actual cost of living increases and wages figures are not yet available. New indexation and benchmarking arrangements New indexation arrangements will be introduced to better reflect cost of living increases for pensioners. As part of the government's reform package, a new pensioner and beneficiary living cost index will be calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This new index will measure increases in the living costs faced by pensioner and beneficiary households, which can be different to those faced by other households. The new living cost index will be more responsive to changes experienced by pensioner households where the living costs may have moved faster than the rate of changes measured by the consumer price index for the living costs of all households. From 20 September 2009, the maximum base rate of relevant social security and veterans pensions will be adjusted in line with either the the consumer price index or the new pensioner and beneficiary living cost index, whichever is the higher. Pension rates will also continue to be benchmarked to male total average weekly earnings. From 20 March 2010, a new pension benchmark for the maximum combined couple rate of pension will be introduced. It will be 41.76 per cent of the annualised amount of male total average weekly earnings. For a person being paid a single rate of pension, the maximum rate payable to that person will be set at 66.33 per cent of the maximum rate payable to a combined couple. Therefore, the new benchmark for the maximum single rate of pension will be 27.7 per cent of male total average weekly earnings, an increase of more than 10 per cent from the current 25 per cent benchmark. Current arrangements will continue to apply for parenting payment (single) and for the disability support pension paid to people under age 21 without children. New pension and seniors supplements The range of supplementary payments and allowances currently paid to pensioners will be simplified and made more flexible through the introduction of a new pension supplement. This will help make pension payments easier to understand. Following the reforms, pensioners will receive two main payments: the base pension and the pension supplement. This new pension supplement incorporates the value of the existing GST supplement, pharmaceutical allowance, utilities allowance and telephone allowance (at the higher internet rate). Increases of $2.49 a week for singles and $10.14 a week for couples combined will be paid on top of the value of existing allowances. The pension supplement will be indexed in March and September each year in line with increases in the consumer price index. will be available only to people resident in Australia or temporarily overseas. The pension supplement for a single pensioner will be around two-thirds, 66.33 per cent, of the pension supplement for a couple combined. This mirrors the new single to couple ratio established for pension rates. At 20 September 2009, it is estimated the pension supplement will be worth up to $1,462.70 a year for singles (or $28.13 a week) and $2,199.60 a year for couples (or $42.30 a week). This is an estimate as the actual indexation increase is not yet known. The pension supplement will be included in the pension payment rate and subject to income and assets testing. This means that, once the base pension rate is reduced to nil, the pension supplement will decrease until it reaches a minimum payment of an estimated $790.40 a year for singles (or $15.20 a week) and $1,190.80 a year for couples (or $22.90 a week). The payment a person receives will not fall below the minimum amount of the pension supplement until the person's income or assets reach a level that would otherwise reduce their payment to nil. The new pension supplement will provide pensioners with more flexibility in managing their own budgets. From 20 September 2009, the pension supplement will be paid fortnightly, along with the base pension. From July 2010, pensioners will have the choice of receiving around half of the pension supplement in quarterly instalments. This flexible part of the pension supplement will be equal to the minimum payment of pension supplement. Self-funded retirees will also benefit from these reforms. A new seniors supplement for holders of a Commonwealth seniors health card will be introduced from 20 September It 2009. The seniors supplement will replace the seniors concession allowance and telephone allowance (at the higher internet rate) for eligible recipients. The seniors supplement will continue to be available as a quarterly payment and will be paid at the same rate as the minimum amount of the pension supplement. The seniors supplement for a single person will be 66.33 per cent of the seniors supplement for a couple combined. In September 2009, the seniors supplement will be an estimated $790.40 a year for singles and $1,190.80 a year for couples. Increases in the pension supplement minimum amount for couples combined and for singles will flow through to increases in the seniors supplement. This will mean pensioners cannot receive less supplement than eligible self-funded retirees. Change to the pension income test As part of the secure and sustainable pension reform package, the pension income test will be tightened. This will help ensure the pension system is sustainable in the longer term, and that increases can be targeted to those most in need. These changes apply to recipients of social security age pension, disability support pension, wife pension, carer payment, widow B pension, bereavement allowance and special needs pension. This change does not apply to recipients of parenting payment (single). From 20 September 2009, the pension income test taper rate will increase from 40c 50c for each dollar of income over the income test free area. Under the new rules, where a pensioner has ordinary income over the income test free area, their rate of pension will reduce by 50c for each dollar of income above the free area. In the case of a pensioner couple, their combined pension will reduce by 50c for each dollar of income (combined) over the income test free area. Pensions paid to each partner will reduce by 25c for each dollar of income (couple, combined) over the income test free area. To bring the pension income test into line with other means-tested payments, including allowances and family assistance, the additional income test ‘free area' for dependent children will be removed. Transitional arrangements will be put in place to protect existing pensioners who would otherwise have faced a payment reduction because of the changes to the income test. The transitional safety net will ensure that current payment rates for part-rate pensioners are maintained in real terms, with indexation in line with increases in the consumer price index, and that they benefit from an increase of $10.14 per week for singles or couples combined. They will continue to receive these existing entitlements, including the increase, until they are better off under the new pension rules, including the new 50c income test withdrawal rate. New ‘work bonus' Some pensioners choose to take up paid work to supplement their pension. A new work bonus will be introduced to help age pensioners keep more of the money they earn from work. The work bonus will provide concessional treatment of employment income under the income test for pensioners over age pension age. Under these new rules, employment income will be assessed fortnightly for pento sioners over age pension age. Only half of all employment income (up to a maximum of $500 a fortnight) will be assessed in the income test. For example, a single age pensioner who works part time with a fortnightly income of $500 will have only half of their income, or $250, from this job assessed under the pension income test. This means that the pensioner will be up to $125 per fortnight better off just as a result of the new work bonus, even after taking into account the tightening of pension income test rules. Further amendments in the bill are made to close the Pension Bonus Scheme. The introduction of the scheme in July 1998 was intended to encourage older Australians who would otherwise retire and claim age pension to remain in the workforce and defer claiming the payment. The Harmer pension review found the scheme is not meeting its objective of encouraging workforce participation among older Australians. As a result, it will be closed to new entrants from 20 September 2009. Existing members of the scheme will be able to remain in the scheme and claim a pension and their bonus when they finish working. Age pension age As part of these reforms, and to improve the longer term sustainability of the pension system, the qualifying age for age pension will increase for both men and women from 65 to 67 years. This will be done on a gradual basis, with the qualifying age for age pension increasing by six months every two years, commencing on 1 July 2017 and will be fully implemented on 1 July 2023. Phasing the change in over this period will allow affected individuals time to plan for their retirement. The change will ensure age pension age is adjusted to reflect the significant improvements in life expectancy that have occurred since the age pension was first introduced in 1909. It will allow the government to respond to the long-term cost of our demographic challenges. This change will not impact on current age pensioners, and will only their fees. affect people born on or after 1 July 1952. The phase-in of the increased age mirrors the rate of increase of the pension age for women, which is currently increasing and will reach 65 years on 1 July 2013. The pension age for veterans will not be increasing as a result of these changes. The male veteran age will remain at 60 years. Pension age for female veterans is currently 58½ years and is gradually increasing to align with male veteran pension age of 60 by 2013. However, the pension age for nonveterans under the Veterans' Entitlements Act will increase in the same manner as the qualifying age for age pension under the Social Security Act. More flexible advance arrangements Existing arrangements for advance payments will be improved, to give pensioners greater access to advances of certain social security payments. Advance payments are lump sum prepayments of a pensioner's entitlements, which are repaid in instalments from future pension payments. The improvements will increase the maximum allowable advance from $500 to around $1,000 for singles and $1,500 for couples combined. The actual maximum advance amounts will be linked to movements in social security pension rates. They will also enable pensioners to access more than one advance in any 12-month period. The changes will modernise the advance payment system to better reflect the needs of pensioners, helping them meet large or unexpected expenses. Pension reform implications for aged care As our population ages, it is vital that we support a strong residential aged-care sector that provides appropriate care for frail older Australians. It is also important that those older Australians who reside in aged-care facilities have some money left after paying The government has decided to share the pension increase between aged-care providers and pensioners. This ensures that pensioners in aged-care homes are able to benefit from the pension increase, while at the same time recognising that care providers also need additional funding to contribute to the costs of services such as nursing care, food and cleaning. Of the pension increase for singles, $10.09 per week will flow to the pensioner and $22.40 per week will flow to the residential aged care provider through an increase to the basic daily fee. As the daily fee charged to self-funded retirees is linked to the amount of the age pension, an increase in the age pension would normally mean the fees faced by self-funded retirees would increase. The government recognises that a sudden cost increase for existing self-funded retiree residents would be an unfair burden, and has decided that those self-funded retirees in residential aged care on 19 September 2009 will have their existing fee levels protected until they leave. Those who enter aged care after this date will have any cost increase phased in over four years. The arrangements for self-funded retirees will also apply to part-rate pensioners who do not benefit from the pension increase. During this period, aged-care providers will be compensated by the government, through a new top-up supplement, for any difference between the actual fee paid by these new part-rate pensioners who may not receive the full pension increase and by self-funded retirees and the new standard basic daily fee-that is, the difference between the phased rate and the standard rate. A combination of increased fees paid by residents and the new top-up supplement represents an increase of $713.2 million over four years for the aged-care sector. This will be available to meet the rising costs that aged-care providers face. At the same time, pensioners will have extra money to meet their out-of-pocket expenses. Changes to family payment indexation The government is taking important steps to reform family payments to make them more sustainable for the long term. As part of these changes, from 1 July 2009 under provisions of this bill, the maximum rates of family tax benefit part A will only be indexed in accordance with movements in the consumer price index. For rates of payment for children under 16 years, current benchmarks to the combined pensioner couple rate (which enable benchmarking to male total average weekly earnings) will be removed. The removal of the link to earnings ensures that government expenditure on family assistance is more sustainable in the long term. The indexation of maximum payment rates in accordance with movements in the consumer price index will continue to maintain the real value of assistance for families on low and moderate incomes. In a tight fiscal environment, savings from reduced expenditure on family tax benefit can be directed to funding other priorities, such as secure and sustainable pension reforms. Australia's spending on family payments is generous by international standards. The most recent analysis shows our spending on cash family benefits was equal third highest in the OECD, at 2.2 per cent of GDP, well above the average of 1.3 per cent. The indexation date for the maternity immunisation allowance will be changed from twice a year to once a year. In line with other family payments, the maternity immunisation allowance will now be indexed on 1 July. The first annual indexation will occur on 1 July 2010. Other measures Recipients of social security and veterans entitlements payments, who receive payments under certain Western Australian programs, will have these amounts excluded from the income test for the purposes of calculating their rate of payment. The Western Australian programs are the Cost of Living Rebate Scheme and the Country Age Pension Fuel Card. The income test concession will start on 1 July 2009 and end on 30 June 2012. The bill also includes amendments relating to the adjusted taxable income test for the Commonwealth seniors health card, whether issued under the Social Security Act or the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The amendments will include in adjusted taxable income any reportable superannuation contributions, including income salary sacrificed to superannuation. These amendments are relocated from the Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Commonwealth Seniors Health Card) Bill 2009, currently before the parliament, but which will be withdrawn. The measure is consistent with changes that have been legislated in respect of a range of pension and allowance income tests, and arrangements that have the existed for the age pension for some time. To better support pensioners who are studying to improve their qualifications, the portability conditions for full-time students on Austudy and youth allowance will be extended to other income support payments. This will apply to a person receiving disability support pension, parenting payment, carer payment, widow B pension, wife pension, partner allowance or widow allowance. If the person is in full-time study and continues to meet the qualification conditions for their payment, they will be entitled to go overseas for more than 13 weeks to study as part of their full-time Australian course. The bill will also amend schedule 2 to the Veterans' Entitlements Act to include a new operational area. This will give Defence Force members allotted for duty in the new operational area during the relevant dates access to pensions and benefits available under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Conclusion This government has acted to introduce long-overdue reforms to significantly improve the adequacy of the pension and to make the pension system simpler and fairer. Reforms to provide long-term security and certainty, and to ensure that, over time, the pension system remains both adequate and sustainable. Reforms which tackle the reality of the ageing population and the challenges this presents. Reforms to adapt to changing circumstances, while maintaining the system's enduring strength. Reforms to guarantee an adequate and sustainable standard of living for the aged, carers, veterans and people with disability who rely on the pension to survive. I commend the bill to the House.

5,Mr NEUMANN ,"Blair) (12.27 pm)When I left off my speech on the International Monetary Agreements Amendment (Financial Assistance) Bill 2009 a week or so ago, I was saying that our relationship with Indonesia is of crucial importance to Australia's economic development and prosperity. In our region we are a neighbour to Indonesia. They partner with us in all kinds of areas, not just in sport and culture but also in terms of tackling the challenges of climate change and education. There are 15,000 students from Indonesia alone studying here in Australia. That brings close to A$500 million into our economy each year. That is an enormous amount of money, contributed by Indonesian families to this economy, helping our prosperity, our economic development and our wealth in this country. So the importance of our relationship with Indonesia cannot be underestimated. We have committed $462 million over the 2008-09 year in official assistance to Indonesia. There have been many visits by senior cabinet ministers, including the Prime Minister, to Indonesia and other parts of South East Asia to show how important our relations with the region are. Lest it be said that we are doing something unusual in terms of partnering with the World Bank and other countries to provide this sort of facilityUS$1 billion to Indonesia as a standby loan-and lest it be said that charity begins at home and somehow we should not be doing this, I say it is extremely important to show that we are a good neighbour to Indonesia and to build on the many ties that we have with Indonesia. In 1989 the Australia-Indonesia Institute was established by the Australian government. Its aim was to develop relations between Australia and Indonesia and to promote greater mutual understanding and expanded areas of contact, and we have had Indonesian students under the program studying here in Australia, for example. Mr Speaker, you and I had the privilege of being there on the 20th anniversary when the Australian ambassador hosted the conference. The goodwill, the amity and the friendship that was there between Australia and Indonesia was quite evident and we must do everything we possibly can to continue to improve the relationship. Our bilateral economic and trade relationship with Indonesia is extremely important. Indonesia was Australia's 13th largest merchandising trading partner in 2007, the 11th largest export market and the 11th largest source of imports. Our main merchandising exports to Indonesia are, of course, wheat, crude petroleum, live animals, aluminium and sugar. Our major imports from Indonesia are crude petroleum, gas pumps, nonmonetary gold and simply worked wood. So it is important for us to acknowledge how vital Indonesia's relationship is with Australia. Our two-way merchandise trade totalled $8.8 billion in 2007. Exports were valued at $3.9 billion and imports at $4.8 billion. Australia was Indonesia's eighth largest export destination and ninth largest source of imports. So the relationship in terms of goods important, providing assistance to Indonesia to ensure that the impacts of the global financial crisis and the global recession are lessened on that country. Our two-way services trade in Indonesia exceeded $1.6 billion in 2007. We are providing assistance in terms of education related travel and personal travel. Our major imports from Indonesia in terms of services were personal travel and transportation as well. So our relationship with Indonesia is simply vital for our economic security as well as our prosperity. But what we are doing in terms of assistance for education is simply vital also. In the education sector strategic planning has been undertaken by Indonesia. The Indonesian people set a goal to ensure that all Indonesian children receive a minimum nine-year primary and junior secondary education. That is so important in increasing the prosperity and productivity of the Indonesian people and ensuring that Indonesian children have a better chance in life. We are partnering with Indonesia in our Australia-Indonesia Basic Education Program. That has an aspiration to ensure that there are 2,000 schools-1,500 general and 500 madrasa schools-constructed to create 330,000 new junior secondary school places for 13to 15year-old Indonesian children. We are financing through that program Indonesian schools and constructing them in consultation with local communities. It is important from the point of view of giving those children a chance in life. I have been to rural Central Kalimantan and to see the delight on the children's faces when they have new facilities there is simply a wonderful experience to enjoy, and to realise that our dollars sent to this place and the work that we do in Indonesia are very important in creating a great deal of goodwill towards Australia as well is most rewarding. Our partnership with Indonesia just does is not go to lending money and helping in terms of education. It also goes to tackling the challenge of climate change. We have engaged with Indonesia in the Kalimantan forest in a climate partnership. Our governments have announced that we will help Indonesia in this regard. That was done at APEC in 2007 by the previous government. We have committed $30 million to the partnership and we hope to attract an additional $70 million over time with other partners. We are trying to work with other partners to ensure that the Peatland Project in Central Kalimantan is also dealt with in such a way as to conserve the environment there and the wetlands because they are just so important for orangutans and other fauna and flora. We are partnering with the World Wide Fund for Nature and the BOS Foundation as well as universities in rural Kalimantan. The largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Indonesia is deforestation, estimated at 80 per cent of national greenhouse gas emissions. Our partnership, the Indonesia-Australia Forest Carbon Partnership, is key to ensuring that we can tackle this problem and deal with this issue in a global way. What we are doing with Indonesia does not go just to education or climate change or cultural and interfaith assistance; we are also helping Indonesia in many ways, and not just in our trade but in other ways as well. We are partnering with them for national security, confronting the problem of peoplesmuggling and dealing with them through Australian Federal Police, who have a presence in Indonesia, tackling the problems of terrorism. We have seen over 200 terrorists prosecuted and convicted by the Indonesians, and the government's initiatives are to be commended with respect to tackling the problem of terrorism. We have seen that in Bali and we have seen it on so many other occasions. Our own embassy has been attacked over there in Jakarta in Indonesia. So our relationship with Indonesia is crucial for our economic development, our national security and in terms of being a good neighbour. In these circumstances this loan, which I note has bipartisan support, should be carried out and we can show just what good neighbours we are with Indonesia. We should also promote the kind of assistance that is crucial to cultural, sporting activities and other help. The legislation before the House does have bipartisan support. I note the comments made by the member for North Sydney in respect of this matter. He was quite equivocal and quite critical of the government in many ways in relation to this legislation, but, despite his criticism of the Rudd Labor government, the coalition will support this legislation, and I commend it to the House.",23
6,Mr BOWEN ,"Prospect-Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law and Minister for Human Services) (12.36 pm)-in reply-I thank all honourable members who have contributed to this debate. The purpose of the International Monetary Agreements Amendment (Financial Assistance) Bill 2009 is to amend the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947-the IMA Act-to extend the current provisions that enable the Treasurer to lend money or enter into a currency swap with a country in support of an International Monetary Fund program. The amendments extend the current arrangements to include support for the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. The amendments will enable Australia to provide a standby loan to Indonesia if needed, as well as to enter into a loan or currency swap with other countries to support World Bank or ADB programs in the future should the need arise. Consistent with the 1998 International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill, this bill will allow Australia to continue to play its part in international cooperation efforts. It is in Australia's national interest to support stability and economic recovery, particularly in our region, an issue on which there is an established history of bipartisanship. The bill also extends the same conditions currently contained in the IMA Act that apply to IMF programs. That is to say, there must be a request by the World Bank or the ADB for Australia's assistance. The agreement must allow Australia to require repayment if the World Bank or ADB program is suspended or prematurely terminated. The Treasurer must be satisfied that the other countries or international organisations involved will also be providing support to the recipient country as part of the World Bank or ADB program. Consistent with the IMA Act the bill will continue to require public release and tabling in each house of parliament of a national interest statement relating to an agreement entered into by Australia under the bill. Statements will include a description of the nature and terms of the agreement and set out why it is in the national interest, having regard in particular to foreign policy, trade and economic interests. The Australian government is tackling the financial crisis both at home and in cooperation with others internationally. This bill will debt. enable Australia to contribute to World Bank and ADB financial assistance programs should the need arise. Provisions contained in the bill will ensure Australia is able to spond quickly to requests to participate in international cooperation efforts during times of crisis and that this assistance is in Austrapromises lia's national interest. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading",25
7,Mr BOWEN ,"Prospect-Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law and Minister for Human Services) (12.39 pm)-by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (EXTENDED MEDICARE SAFETY NET) BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 May, on motion by Ms Roxon: That this bill be now read a second time.",26
8,Mr DUTTON ,"Dickson) (12.40 pm)The Health Insurance Amendment (Extended Medicare Safety Net) Bill 2009 represents yet another Labor attack on health care for Australians. The measures contained in this bill will put a cap on payments under the Medicare safety net for a variety of medical services, putting those treatments out of the reach of a great many Australians and imposing yet another burden on ordinary Australians at a time when they can least afford it because of this government's reckless spending, which is pushing this nation into record The government will make savings of $450 million over four years as a result of rethis measure. This bill comes just days after the Prime Minister and his Minister for Health and Ageing shredded the solemn that they made over a lengthy period of time not to change private health insurance rebate regimes, which encourage Australians to take out health insurance and in doing so relieve some of the pressure on the nation's public healthcare system. Not content with that attack on one of the fundamentals that have given Australia one of the best health systems in the world, the government is now intent on bringing more pain to Australians requiring various medical treatments-in the main to elderly Australians needing cataract surgery and young couples either having children or needing help to do so. Health featured heavily in this government's campaign for office with a lengthy list of the things that it would or would not do. Before the House now is a bill that does exactly what this government said it would not do. This bill represents yet another broken promise on health from this government and Australians are now starting to realise that Mr Rudd would clearly say anything at all or do anything at all in his pursuit of power. Let us look at what the health minister was saying with regard to the Medicare safety net in the run-up to the last election. Here is what she said to the Meet the Press program in September 2007: We are setting out a comprehensive plan and the safety net is part of that plan that we are commitones ted to and we will be running on for the election. Today we see what the minister's commitments mean. Let us look back again to September 2007 and to one of those now infamous joint media releases from now Prime Minister Rudd and Minister Roxon: A Rudd Labor government will retain the Medicare safety net as Australian working familiesLet me repeat that: as Australian working familieshave come to rely on it for help with their family budgets. The document goes on: Federal Labor will not put more pressure on family budgets by taking that assistance away. One can only wonder what working families think right now. There has been no other period in recent times when working families have been under more pressure than they are right now. One million Australians earning less than $26,000 a year have private health insurance. This health minister says they will not be hurt by her attack on insurance rebates. Wait until premiums rise by more than would have been necessary and let us see if they are not hurt then. She also says that the measures in these bills which cap payments under the Medicare safety net will not hurt. Tell that to Australia's senior citizens and pensioners, one of the groups most impacted by this government action. The extended Medicare safety net was introduced by the former coalition government in 2004 to protect Australians from high outof-pocket expenses for medical services provided out of hospital. About one million Australians each year receive payments under the safety net to help them with their large medical bills-among them, no doubt, many working families, many senior Australians and pensioners and many young people starting or seeking to start a family. They are the who will be hit hardest by the caps the government now seeks to put on the Medicare safety net. Caps are to be put on: all obstetric services; some pregnancy related ultrasounds; all assisted reproductive technology, including IVF; varicose vein treatment; and cataract surgery. Cataract surgery gets hit twice by this government-in these measures and elsewhere in the government's budget. It is unbelievable. Now the government blames doctors for the need to impose these changes to the Medicare safety net and Australians who incur high medical costs and benefit from it. ‘Doctors are taking advantage of the safety net; doctors are charging excessive fees' has become the somewhat repetitive refrain. Of course, it has nothing to do with the government's debt splurge that now requires them to find every cent of saving they can in this budget to fund the $300 billion of debt this nation will be saddled with in a few short years. Senior Australians needing cataract surgery must pay for this government's reckless behaviour, so too must young couples seeking to start a family. These changes pose very important questions. Did the government really think through what these changes would mean? Are they sure of what they are doing here? Let us have a look at cataract surgery. Under this bill a cap is going to be placed on one cataract procedure, but this will combine with other budget measures to bring about significant changes. The government will have the MBS rebates for this medical procedure from around $600 to around $300. Patients, many of them senior Australianspensioners and retirees-will have to pay hundreds of dollars out of their own pocket and for some procedures only a small part will now be recoverable from the safety net. Around 120,000 or more Australians undergo surgery each year, with 200,000 cataract operations. The majority of cataract operations-70 per cent-are done in the private system, with only 30 per cent done in public hospitals. There are substantial waiting lists for treatment in the public system. The effect of this would seem to be to drive patients to the already congested public health system. That is at the core of so many of the government's ill thought out decisions in health. At the last election they promised they would fix public hospitals by mid-2009 and now, if we reflect on the 18 months since they made that announcement, every decision they have taken in health will put only more pressure on the public health system. The Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association of New South Wales has described these changes as ‘disastrous'. The association says that the costs will prove impossible for pensioners and other lowincome earners to meet and they will not receive what is an essential medical service. They believe services in regional and rural areas could be cut altogether. Noted eye surgeon Dr Bill Glasson agrees. He has restored the sight of thousands of people in rural and remote areas of Australia. It is worth hearing what he has to say about what this government is doing. He told the ABC: The impact really is going to be on the battlers across Australia, particularly those in rural regional Australia, particularly Indigenous and it's just going to make things tougher and tougher. They've given the pensioners $30 on one hand and effectively taking $300 with the other handit is a very short-sighted decision and all this is going to do is drive more and more people out onto the public waiting list. That is what this minister and the Prime Minister-this government that promised to fix health-are doing to the battlers, to the working families and to the pensioners of our country. Seventy per cent of people aged in their 80s will suffer cataracts. Surgery that restores vision has other beneficial outcomes. Of course, if people who are ageing have difficulty with their sight they are likely to have falls, fractures, hospitalisation and treatment for other outcomes of poor vision. This government is going to block those people from having this life-saving, and lifechanging in many cases, surgery. It is inconceivable that this government could believe that this is a measure that ultimately will result in savings. The Society of Ophthalmologists has described the government's action as a ‘huge blow' to patients. It says it will put the cost of private cataract surgery beyond the reach of average Australians. Remember, 70 per cent of all current cataract surgery is carried out in the private sector. What does that say for the public sector from here? More patients waiting longer. Ophthalmology already has the longest waiting times of any specialist surgery. That is the result of this government's broken promises. This is hardly what you would call fixing health. There are the broken promises and then there is the hypocrisy. This bill is going to cap payments to Australian couples who need help in starting a family. Assisted reproductive technology and and IVF will be hit hard. More than 40,000 people accessed IVF services last year with the support of the Medicare safety net. It is estimated that 11,000 babies were born in this country as a result. Medical sources also estimate that one in six couples will have fertility problems of some sort and need assistance to start a family. I do not need to speak against this measure. I will let members of the Rudd cabinet do that. Their hypocrisy in putting this measure forward is astounding. Only three years ago none other than the Deputy Prime Minister was extremely vocal in her support for IVF. Now she sits on the sidelines, it seems, in silence as this measure is pushed through by her own government. Julia Gillard presented petitions to this parliament in support of IVF treatment. At that time she spoke out against mooted changes to Medicare and said, ‘Labor opposes any cutbacks to Medicare funding of IVF.' Let me repeat that for the benefit of the House and for all Australians listening to this debate: ‘Labor opposes any cutbacks to Medicare funding of IVF.' What a cruel hoax that was, Deputy Prime Minister. What a disgrace that you are now part of a government which is ripping apart the support to those people who are most in need. The Deputy Prime Minister also said only three short years ago: It is a cruel thing to do to Australian women ticularly older Australian women, whose only hope of falling pregnant is through the IVF process. That was the Deputy Prime Minister's view, which was reflected by many who are now in government when they were on the back bench of the Labor opposition. Clearly, they have done a complete about-face. That is what makes the government such a joke when they talk about their commitment to fixing health. Everything they have done over the last 18 months in the health program has put only extra pressure on an already overstretched system. No fewer than four Labor members presented petitions to this House four years ago, among them Ministers Emerson and Burke, and perhaps even the current Treasurer, Mr Swan, joined the campaign in favour of IVF. Where are these people now? That is not my question but the question of thousands of people who feel betrayed by this government, thousands of Australians who feel ripped off by this government. This clearly is a policy driven by Treasury, not by Health. It is a policy driven by Treasury and Finance, and it cannot have any basis in good health outcomes. It cannot be the basis for this government's decision to rip away support for needy Australians, the people who rely on that safety net. I have met, spoken and corresponded with thousands of Australians in relation to their experience on IVF. I want to bring to the attention of the House one compelling case. I read from a Friends of QFG Newsletter which was presented to me by one of my constituents. For the benefit of the House, I will read some excerpts from a letter to the editor of that particular newsletter: Brian and I had been married for about 7 years and although he had been ready for children from day 1 I was now finally ready. It was June 1998 … I was only 27. We tried with no success and parBrian had a sperm test with his GP that came back perfect. I then went to my GP and was told to relax and have a holiday “you're young” don't worry about it. The letter goes on to say: We managed to get into see Dr Bob Watson in February 2004. He asked an enormous amount of questions and sent both Brian and I off for more dreaded blood tests that seemed to never end, this was the start of attempting to overcome my fear of needles … … … … Well we rocked up refreshed and eager to get this over with even though we were told that IUIs probably wouldn't work for us but it's worth giving it a go. Two attempts at that was more than enough for me, bring on the big guns that should work. Off to Wickham Terrace to meet with Gail for the details about IVF and all the drugs. We started out the first of what was to be all 8 stimulated IVF cycles on 11 June 2004, the first FSH injection (125 units) was on our 13th wedding anniversary 29 June 2004. That first cycle, although in hindsight one of the worse, was good because we really didn't know what we were doing or what to expect. I knew that the chance of success on the first go was slim but I was very positive and when it failed before I even had my blood test I fell in a heap. I just sat on the bathroom floor and cried. … … … Brian and I picked ourselves up from that cycle and thought if we went back quickly that would be the best way to cope. The second cycle started in September we got 9 eggs (due to 600 units of FSH) but none fertilized … November 2004 was to be our third cycle … This cycle also was the first time we used ICSI, we couldn't have coped with another cycle with no transfer so we hoped this was the answer … By this stage we had never had any embryos good enough to freeze so we had 3 transferred, but again it wasn't to be. I changed jobs because the stress at work was too much and we thought that this would help, well it didn't. It was easier though as I decided it was easier not to tell my workmates. This was one place I could go and not think about IVF, it was great. I also joined the Friends of QFG committee, I felt they had helped me so much that if I could help one person the way they had helped me it would be great. We started our fourth cycle in April 2005. This failed and to top it all off I got a nasty infection. Still not willing to give up, our 5th cycle began in June 2005, Bob did the pickup, we got 14 eggs, that was the most so far and 9 fertilised, surely it would work this time, Dr Kilvert transferred 2 of our precious embryos and I still didn't make it to a blood test. … … … The sixth cycle this was the worse EVER. I got 13 eggs and 10 fertilised. Bob said they were the worse quality yet, but we had 3 transferred. This lady goes on to say: full Maybe 7 was the cycle for us, a new year a new attitude. Three were transferred this time, with the works, ICSI, hatching, embryo glue and more drugs Cardiprin, Prednisone and HCG injections after transfer. We went on holidays and relaxed, it had to work this time. We made it to the blood test, but it wasn't to be. A week later I was so sick I had stopped the prednisone the same as I had on previous cycles but this time it was a higher dose and my body could not deal with it. Brian touched me on the arm and I sobbed because my skin hurt intensely … … … … I had begun to have severe pain on day 2 of my cycle the previous September, so I asked Bob what he could do about this and he scheduled laparoscopy etc on 10 March 2006, this only discovered mild endo. Brian and I were starting to get quite down about the whole IVF thing by now, so I decided we would try everything. This lady goes on to say, ‘We tried boot camp,' and: … walking group 2 nights per week. Bob had suggested that losing a bit of weight might help … I also saw a Dietician … … … … This lady continues, ‘I wanted to see this particular doctor and was referred by the specialist.' She goes on to say: (the immunologist) phoned me on day 2 of what was to be our 8th cycle (8 has always been my favourite and lucky number). He told me to take Cardiprin, Caltrate, Folate and Vitamin E and get some tests done the next day. The test took 13 vials of blood. The cycle went well … and I had the transfer on Good Friday, then came the dreaded 2 week wait with the added bonus of Fragmin injections daily from day 3 after transfer and 2 lots of HCG top ups. I made it to the blood test on the Friday of the Labour day long weekend. I felt good, but the test came back negative … Bob convinced us to talk to one of the scientists and then come and see him as he wanted to discuss “donor eggs” with us again. At the end of the appointment Brian mentioned that the dreaded period had not arrived yet, so Bob sent me for another blood test the next morning. It came back positive, Bob thought maybe it was ectopic so I went back 2 days later, it had doubled and then again the next week it had more than doubled each day. Then finally a scan and the look on Bob's face when he saw the heartbeat was priceless. Brian and I couldn't believe it. We were pregnant. Many scans later I was finally an obstetrics patient, I never thought I would see that day … 18 weeks and Brian found out what we were having, I didn't want to know it as I had always from the transfer felt I was meant to have a girl. 24, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36 week scans finally whether I wanted to know or not it was obvious we were having a girl. It still felt like the wait, the Fragmin was coming to an end, for a needle phobic like me it was about time, 8 months of injections every day. Yuck. The Cardiprin finished on week 37 and Emily Charlotte was born at 1.46pm. 22 December 2006 (my Dad's birthday) at five pound 10 ounces by caesarean. Bob declared she was perfect and Brian and I could finally breathe a sigh of relief, she was here. We have met some fabulous people throughout our journey, people who truly understand just what you're going through. Our thanks go out to all of them … There is a little bit more to the letter, but I will finish there. That was by two amazing Australians, two people who represent the stories of so many thousands. It is very tough to read for any of us who have been involved in this debate. It is an emotional debate because people's lives, their futures and their perspectives on life are changed as a result of this particular cruel outcome by this government. No contributor to this debate could sit opposite and say honestly to the parliament this is a good health outcome. That is why the Deputy Prime Minister, when she was Deputy Leader of the Labor Party in opposition, stood up and rallied against any proposed changes. She railed against those changes because she knew that support should not be taken away from families who needed that support at their most desperate hour and deserved to have that continuing support. This is a government that, of course, has gone into incredible debt-that is not a political statement; it is a fact. The economic certainty is not there at the moment; it has changed significantly over the last 12 or 18 months, at the same time that the government has spent $42 billion-not one of those dollars in health. Why would it continue with these cruel cuts when it knows that it has the capacity in other areas to allocate the money to save these people the extra stress? The story 2 week that I just read out completely and adequately represents the feelings of many of these people who have gone through IVF to create a family, to make their mark on the world, to bring a child into the world. There is no better reason for our existence than to bring new life into this world. This government's cruel attack on the ability of families to be able to access that support really should stand condemned. I say to the government: the coalition will offer bipartisan support in trying to find other savings to offset this measure if the government sees fit to reverse it. We will work in a bipartisan way to see that this support is kept for those thousands of Australians who deserve this support from their government. We will work with the government to make sure that we relieve the burden that is now being put on these families at a time when they need anything but more burden. The story that I just read is compelling because it describes in some detail the incredible pressure that these families-in some cases for years and years and yearsand, in particular, the women involved in these processes endure. Why on earth we as a parliament and this government would put extra pressure on those families in a time of most need is completely beyond any reasonable voice as part of this debate. We say to the government: ‘Please reconsider your position. Reconsider your position in light of the comments made by the Deputy Prime Minister when she was sitting in opposition as Deputy Leader of the Labor Party.' None of the facts have changed in relation to this debate from the time that the Deputy Prime Minister made her comments to this debate today. None of the facts have changed when petitions by the thousands were presented to this parliament by other members who now sit on the front bench of the government. None of the facts have changed which would lend any credibility to a change in the position and the arrival at what the government now proposes. That is the position of the coalition. We offer support to the government to see a more rational outcome. We want to make sure that these families who have incredible pressures on them already have some of that pressure relieved, not more put on them. That is our call on the government, and that is what we will continue to fight for on behalf of so many Australians over the coming period of this debate.",26
9,Ms HALL ,"Shortland) (1.04 pm)-The Health Insurance Amendment (Extended Medicare Safety Net) Bill 2009 amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 to enable the Minister for Health and Ageing to determine the maximum benefit payable under the extended Medicare safety net-I will refer to it from here on in as the EMSN-for each Medical Benefits Schedule, MBS, item. The bill creates a mechanism by which the government can responsibly manage the expenditure on the EMSN. I need to state very clearly at the commencement of my contribution to this debate: this legislation does remove any item from the MBS; all items remain on the schedule. What it does is put a cap on the MBS item which is determined in line with the median cost or charge that is made by specialists. Median cost means that that is the midpoint in the cost schedule. There are some specialists who are charging rather exorbitant fees, but I will come to that later in my contribution to the debate. As I have already mentioned, the EMSN benefit cap will apply to benefits for MBS items, which will be payable in addition to the standard Medicare rebate once a patient reaches the EMSN threshold. Each patient will be eligible to receive up to the EMSN benefit cap each time they receive a service. There will be no limit on service; each time they will be able to receive that benefit. Once an individual or a member of a registered family reaches the applicable out-of-pocket EMSN threshold, the person is entitled to an increase in the Medicare benefit equal to 80 per cent of their out-of-pocket expenses for that claim for the rest of the calendar year. I am sure that members on both sides of this House are acquainted with constituents within their electorates who fall into this category. The increased amount of the Medicare benefit payable under the EMSN is commonly referred to as EMSN benefit. A different level of EMSN benefit cap can apply to different EMSN items. The EMSN benefit cap would be a dollar value. For example, an EMSN benefit cap of $100 may apply to one item and for a different item it may be $500. There are three things that I have sought to establish here: (1) no item is excluded from the MBS (2) the caps can vary according to the item number and (3) those people who reach the EMSN threshold will continue to receive a refund equal to 80 per cent of their Medicare benefits. Currently there is no limit on the amount not of benefit payable under the EMSN and a person will receive 80 per cent of out-ofpocket expenses for services, which means that, if a doctor chooses to charge an exorbitant fee, that patient will still receive an per cent refund. One patient may go to a doctor who charges $500 for an item on the MBS and another patient may go to one who charges $2,000 for the same service. This legislation provides for the fact that some doctors are charging three or four times what other doctors charge for the same item number. Taking a midpoint from the example I just gave, the median figure would be $1,000. This legislation enables the minister to determine the cap on the EMSN benefit, which will be set out in the legislative instruments. The bill will cover 15 obstetric items, which will generate a saving of $451.6 million over four years. As has been mentioned in the debate so far, these savings were part of the 2009-10 budget. The implementation date for the bill is 1 January next year. As the shadow minister for health and ageing rightly pointed out, one area that will be impacted is IVF. As a member of this parliament, I am very supportive of IVF. Assisted reproduction has helped many people, including people I know-family and friends-to have that much sought after child. This legislation in no way seeks to stop that. The shadow minister gave an example in relation to a woman who underwent eight cycles. She will still be able to undergo eight cycles under this legislation. There is no limit on the number of cycles a person may undergo. If members on the other side of this House are going to argue that the islation limits the number of cycles, they are misrepresenting the legislation. I emphasise yet again: what it does is put a cap on particular MBS services. The extended Medicare safety net service will continue for all Australians and for all services currently covered. The safety net threshold has not been changed from the $555.70 for Commonwealth concession card 80 holders and $1,111.60 for all others in each calendar year. It is indexed each year, and will continue to be indexed each year, in line with the consumer price index. The government is not seeking and will not seek to means test access to the EMSN. It seems to me that a lot of the speakers on this debate from the other side of the House have sought to scare people in the community. I find that the approach of the opposition in relation to this has been less than optimal. Another matter was brought up by the member for Dickson that I would like to touch on. He referred to ophthalmic surgeons. Yes, that is one area upon which a cap will be placed, but he also referred to how that would impact on Indigenous Australians, linking it into private health insurance. I suspect that the member for Dickson should undertake a little research into how many Indigenous Australians will actually be affected by this. The answer would be: next to none. To come into this House and use that as part of his argument shows that he has very limited knowledge of health and very little knowledge particularly of Indigenous health and the needs of Indigenous Australians. I would like him to consult with experts in this area, people who work on a dayto-day basis with Indigenous Australians, to put some facts to the fiction he has been putting forward in the parliament today. The government chose to put this measure in place, to cap benefits at a level which covleg- ers average payments. Reasonable amounts will not be affected. If a person visits a doctor who charges a reasonable amount, an average fee, they will receive a refund of 80 per cent. There is no cycle limit and no items are being removed. Another thing the opposition were touting is that it is going to affect cancer patients, but cancer patients will not be affected. This measure has been well researched. The government commissioned a review to which evidence was given. The opposite side are saying that those in greatest financial need will miss out on the benefits. It is the patients with higher incomes who are claiming higher out-of-pocket expenses. The review found that for every EMSN benefit dollar paid to patients 78c went to meeting the doctor's higher fee rather than to reducing the patient's out-of-pocket expenses. I put very strongly to this parliament that the EMSN is about making services that Australians need more affordable, to enable them to purchase services, to undertake IVF or to have a cataract operation. I would strongly argue that, if 78c of each benefit dollar goes to meeting the doctor's higher fees rather than to reducing the patient's out-of-pocket expenses, this scheme is not working in the way it was meant to. Putting the cap in place will ensure that patients benefit rather than doctors. As I mentioned earlier, those who have benefited most from the more affordable services have tended to be wealthier and in a better position to access some of the more expensive services in the first place. The EMSN did create some problems for the Howard government, who raised the safety net expenditure threshold so that they could reduce the number of people who would qualify for the EMSN and they did that to rein in the cost. We are not doing that; in this legislation, we are putting in place a cap designed to come into play at the average fee point. I do not support what those on the other side of the parliament have been sayingthat this is about stopping women or families receiving IVF assistance; rather, it is about ensuring that they see doctors who charge an average fee. They will still get 80 per cent of the EMSN. This is only about the high end, about doctors who charge exorbitant fees. There are doctors involved in IVF who earn incomes in excess of $4 million a yearrather a large salary. We support women continuing to receive funding for an unlimited number of cycles and we support all items remaining on the MBS, but we do not support paying 80 per cent when doctors charge exorbitant fees. I support the legislation and I encourage those on the other side of the House to look at what the legislation does, rather than putting out a smear and fear campaign, as they always do. I encourage them to provide the correct information to their constituents, telling women or pensioners who visit them, ‘Yes, you can still get 80 per cent of your fee back, but you must go to a specialist who will charge a median fee and not an exorbitant fee.'",32
10,Mr MORRISON ,"Cook) (1.22 pm)-The Health Insurance Amendment (Extended Medicare Safety Net) Bill 2009 is a cruel bill. It is a heartless bill. Contrary to what has just been suggested in this House, it has nothing to do with people having any restriction placed on them as to how many IVFs they can undertake. This bill will put up the cost by between $1,500 and $2,000 a cycle for those who are looking to use assisted reproductive technologies. That is what the impact of this bill will be and, for many Australians, that will mean the end of the road of their dream to have children. It is a heartless bill and it is a cruel bill, and to sit here in this place and listen to the suggestions put forward by those on the other side that this is all about overcharging doctors and there not being caps on how many times you can do it says one thing to me: they just do not get it. Those opposite really do not understand what the impact of this bill will be on people who are desperate to have children. Infertility is not a choice. It is not something you wish for. It is not something that you elect. It happens to you, like many things in life happen to you. Just under one in six couples of reproductive age in this country have a fertility problem. IVF is responsible for some 11,000 births each year. Around 40,000 treatments were provided in 2008. Around one child today in a classroom of 25 is in that classroom because of IVF and other related treatments. Forty per cent of fertility problems relate to men, 40 per cent to women and 20 per cent are of non-specific cause, which is one of the hardest things to deal with when you just do not know why. IVF and related assisted reproductive treatments are the only hope for people afflicted with infertility. I make reference to a statement made by Sandra Dill, the Chief Executive of Access Australia, which is the group that supports, represents and provides assistance to those who are going through this horrendous ordeal. She says: IVF is the last chance for many to have a child their own and the Medicare Safety Net has ensured that every Australian has that opportunity. The Government's decision has taken away many Australians last chance to have a baby. This is a cause which sits very close to my heart. I have taken the unusual step today of returning from leave. My wife gave birth to a child last Thursday-our second child, Lily Alice. Our first child, Abbey Rose, was born on the 7th of the 7th of the 7th-14 years from when my wife and I began assisted reproductive treatments, which consisted of 10 IVF cycles. It was a horrendous ordeal. My wife had very difficult surgery and we were finally able to conceive a child without the ultimate assistance of IVF. Everything we learned along the road-every day, every lesson, every treatment and every piece of advice-was critical to our path and to the process of having children. The desire to have children is the most positive, life-affirming instinct we as human beings have. The desire does not go away when you are told that you cannot have children or that you will have difficulty having them. The feeling of loss at every failed attempt is indescribable. Others, removed from the emotional hell, rationalise the failure of embryos failing to take, while parents and want-to-be parents grieve the loss of children. We console ourselves with the thought that one day we will be reunited with our unborn child beyond this life. Added to this physical and emotional torment is the pressure that it places on extremely fragile relationships working through these very difficult issues. Most families understand the sacrifice involved in having children. They understand that as they have those children and see them growing up in their homes. It means many changes to our lives-many welcome changes, I must add. But one of the reasons we as parents can deal with those sacrifices of is that it is accompanied by the sheer joy of parenthood-and there is nothing to match it. Some people go through fertility treatment over extended periods of time. You would have heard the member for Dickson recount an incredibly moving story, which I am so pleased had a happy ending even though so many of these stories do not. For those going through the hell of fertility treatment over an extended period of time, their first experience of parenthood is only sacrifice. That is all that many will ever know; the joy of parenthood never comes. The pain of these experiences is not altered by your level of income. It does not change how you feel and what goes on inside you. Regardless of how much or how little you have, you do whatever it takes to make this work. You make the sacrifices. You take out the extended loan or the second mortgage. You do whatever you need to do to try to realise that dream. For families going through this very dark chapter of their lives, it is all consuming. The reason I am pointing this out is that I do not believe that those in the government have got a full handle on the depth of this issue or a real appreciation of the pain that they are going to inflict on their fellow Australians as a result of this measure. When you go through this, everything comes into question. You are challenged spiritually, emotionally, physically and financially. You question everything-God, each other, your priorities, your future. Nothing escapes scrutiny when you are going through this treatment and this ordeal. Along this road you will find the wreckage of shattered lives, marriages and families. But when you do this you know the risks you take, because you are so committed to and so passionate about the fact that one day you might be able to realise that dream of bringing a child into the world, which I believe is a very pure dream. Against this background, the government has introduced this bill and has moved, as the previous speaker said, to cap payments under the Medicare safety net for IVF and related fertility treatments. The bill also imposes caps on a range of other services-including obstetric services, pregnancy related ultrasounds and cataract surgery. I will not touch on these; the shadow minister has already mentioned these. The saving that is expected to be gained from this measure is $475 million. Just to put that in context, that is less than two per cent of what the Labor government borrowed and gave away in cash payments. So what we are seeing right here before us in this bill is one of the many costs the spending that this government has engaged in. As I mentioned at the start of my remarks, the cost for couples is estimated to rise from $1,600 or thereabouts-and for many it is far more than that-in out-of-pocket expenses to around $3,000 to $3,500. So when the previous speaker, the member for Shortland, makes the assertion that this measure will not end the dream of Australians seeking to have children she clearly does not understand what the consequences of the cap will be. The cost will go up significantly. It will more than double for some families and some couples-for many couples, I expect. I think Labor are in complete denial when it comes to this measure. I think they are looking to run and hide. I think they want this legislation to move through this parliament as quickly as possible because they are, frankly, ashamed and embarrassed about it. They have taken a position on this matter which is in complete contradiction to what is outlined in this bill, so they sit here in denial and put forward these arguments, but, frankly, they should sit silent because this is an indefensible measure, particularly as it relates to IVF and related procedures. The pressure on these couples is hard enoughand I have given some of my own insight into that-without the added anguish of having to find that extra money. It is bad enough. It is hard enough. The relationships are already under enough stress. Having watched my wife go through these procedures many, many times and seen the health impacts on her as she dealt with them, to know that she then would have to also endure additional financial stress would be simply too much to bear. It will be too much to bear for many, and they will just say, ‘I can't go on.' I know what it is like to have reached that point: after 10, we actually did reach that of point. At some other time, we thought, we might go forward again. Thanks be to God, we had the situation where, after the surgery and some years later, things happened. But that is not a normal story; that is actually quite a miraculous story. That is why we refer to our little girl, Abbey Rose, as our miracle child. It does not always work out like that-in fact, it rarely does. So I ask the government to be kind enough to listen. A week or so ago I recounted the story of Jenny and me in the Sunday Telegraph and I have had an enormous response from people going through the same situation. I want to read out some of those responses. One said: My husband and I are currently going through IVF and it is not an easy path. Even with government subsidies, it is expensive. I can't believe that the government is going to implement changes which will make it even more difficult for couples who are already going through great emotion in their lives. Unless you've experienced the grief of infertility and miscarriage, I doubt that anyone would be quite aware of the impact it can have on a person's day-today life. The grief is ongoing, mourning because of a failed cycle, utter devastation at yet another miscarriage. Yes, some people go on to live fulfilling lives without children, but for my husband and I this is not an option we want to consider without first exhausting all possible options, including IVF first. I strongly encourage those affected by Mr Rudd's heartless decision to keep fighting this as it is only way that we can even try to stop this very cruel funding cut. Again in 2008, another said: My husband and I had four unsuccessful IVF attempts. This year is now a recovery year, emotionally and financially, and we had all intentions of starting up again in 2010. This now looks to be unlikely due to the new changes the government will be putting in place. Unless we win Lotto, the government has forced us to accept the fact that we could well remain childless forever. Not an easy realisation. These are not my words. These are the words of those who are affected by this measure, and their voices should be heard. Another said: I think a lot of people do not realise that, even with the existing rebates, IVF is not free. Far from it, in fact. Not to mention all the in-between appointments, tests and exploratory procedures that seem to come with the territory. And no-one ever thinks that they will need to go to IVF once, let alone four or 10 times, so how can you properly save or prepare for that expense when everyone including the doctors, nurses, friends, families tells you to never give up, the next cycle just might be the one that works. How can you simply give up and walk away from that hope or possibility? I wonder if Kevin Rudd or Wayne Swan would have made the same decision if any of their own children or friends needed fertility treatment. And again: We are the unlucky ones: 13 cycles, one with a miscarriage of eight weeks, nearly $80,000 poorer. I would have kept going too. We borrowed money on three credit cards then finally had to extend our mortgage because we could not keep up with the payments. It would have been worth every single penny if we had conceived successfully. And another: I think the Rudd government did a good beat-up of IVF in the months coming into the budget with false facts that were made to look like IVF companies were profiting and the community was the paying 80 per cent of the IVF when in fact they only pay for a quarter of the total bill. Partly as a result of this beat-up, the general community are indifferent to the cause. The cost that is included in the statements to the media only included the Medicare part of the cost of IVF and not the day surgery, fertility specialist, appointments, nonrefundable tests like the SSA, which we had done. This test cost approximately $800 alone, but made us realise we had a problem and contributed to us changing some vitamins, succeeding in our second ISCI. These are the stories of those who deal with this problem every day, and they understand what the impact of this bill is. Those who practise in the area also understand that it will put increased pressure on the actual medical procedures themselves, because those who are going through these procedures will not want to risk the loss of an opportunity of going through a further cycle for financial reasons and they will ask to have additional eggs put back in. That increases the risk to a mother and increases the risk to both children in a multiple birth. This has not come from the opposition; this has come from medical practitioners in the area. I know, as a parent now but as one who went through this process, that these are the things that go through your head. These are the issues that you have to try to resolve. You do not want to have to take that extra risk. You do not want to have to go through that process again if you can avoid it. But you also have to try to maximise your chances of success-and if you do not have that next chance, then you will take greater risks. I think what makes this measure even more disgraceful is the hypocrisy of the government in bringing it forward. In 2005, the then shadow health minister, now the Deputy Prime Minister, said: Labor completely opposes any cutbacks to Medicare funding of IVF. Labor will be launching a petition against the changes to Medicare funded IVF by the Howard government, tomorrow in Canberra. Then, in a doorstop interview in 2005, she said: Tony Abbott and John Howard before the election, were wandering around saying the best thing about Medicare is that it's an uncapped scheme, a patient-driven scheme. The Prime Minister went so far as to say that's fundamental. Well, what was fundamental before the election is expendable after the election with this plan to cap Medicare funding for IVF. John Howard and Tony Abbott should listen to the Australian community, to the Labor Party and to women within their own ranks, and back down today on this proposed very cruel cutback. And at the same time they should rule out capping Medicare for other things that Minister Abbott deems non-essential. Frankly, the Deputy Prime Minister and the government should take their own advice, because on that occasion the government did listen and did change their policy. They listened and they understood. They became sympathetic and understood the challenges that were faced by couples in this situation. They showed a heart and reversed the measure. That measure is in this parliament today, brought forward by those who gave that advice to the previous government. I can think of no more bitter hypocrisy than that. But it went further, because not only did they say those things in the press; they took up petitions. They collected, in total, 1,759 signatures, including those in a petition lodged by the previous speaker, the member for Shortland. I am interested to know whether she is going to write to the 240 citizens who signed her petition to oppose cuts to Medicare funding for IVF and tell them that her government are now going to do exactly what she was trying to get their support to stop the then government from doing. Is she going to write to those 240 citizens? Is the Deputy Prime Minister going to write to the more than 1,300 citizens whose signatures she collected and apologise to them for her act of hypocrisy in being supportive of this bill coming before the House? She would not even answer questions, when put to her in this House, about whether she supported this bill, given the fact that she had collected more than 1,300 signatures opposing the measures that she in fact has brought before the House. There were also petitions from the Treasurer, from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, from the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, and from other members. The government said one thing and are doing another. Either they were being deceitful and disingenuous at that time or they are being heartless today. They can take their pick, but either is abominable. Either should bring them to the table, as the shadow minister was saying before, to talk to the opposition about how these things can be avoided. The government's budget is dripping with spending, yet they put through a cut like this which will deny a person the opportunity to become a parent. For that, I think they need to take a good, hard look at themselves in the mirror. There are savings that can be found in this budget. In my shadow portfolio alone, the first home saver accounts have underperformed by 96 per cent. Even if we just capped the scheme at 10 per cent of what its projected take-up was going to be, the savings over the next three years would be $700 million. The Minister for Housing did not bring to the table one dollar of savings in housing portfolio that could have avoided the government bringing forward this measure. She did not do that, and it was left to the Minister for Health and Ageing to find savings. I must say that on other matters I have found the Minister for Health and Ageing to be very encouraging, particularly in relation to epidermolysis bullosa and the support given in the budget to children suffering from that condition. I welcome that and I applaud and commend the minister for taking what I think is a very compassionate position. It cost $16 million and she was very supportive of our representations on the matter. I encourage her now to speak to her colleagues and encourage them to be compassionate on this matter. When in opposition, the government opposed the very thing they have brought forward in this House. They cannot justify it on the basis that they have lost control of their budget. They should get control of their budget. They should avoid the inclination to bring in such heartless and hypocritical measures. Most importantly, they must listen to the people who are affected and they must come to the table and change this measure immediately.",34
11,Mr NEUMANN ,"Blair) (1.42 pm)-I rise to speak in support of the Health Insurance Amendment (Extended Medicare Safety Net) Bill 2009. First, I want to congratulate the member for Cook and his wife on the birth of their second child. I have two daughters myself. Fortunately, we did not have any difficulties with my wife, Carolyn, falling pregnant. My daughters are now 18 and 19. They are the love of our lives and we rejoice in their development spiritually, educationally, socially and intellectually. It is wonderful to have children. They are a great blessing and heritage. Those of us of the Christian faith accept that scriptural injunction. In relation to this bill, I say to the member for Cook that the trouble is that there is a the great deal of inconsistency between what the coalition are saying and what they did in practice when they were in power. The truth is that in my area alone they effectively defunded health and hospital services. That is the reality. We have one GP for every 1,609 people in my area, the Ipswich and West Moreton area in South-East Queensland. Even the former Minister for Health and Ageing, the member for Warringah, admitted before the last election in October 2007 that the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare had got it absolutely correct in saying that the previous coalition government, under John Howard, had actually defunded health and hospitals in this country and that the states had had to take up the slack. The much-maligned state Labor governments had to take up the slack because the previous coalition government failed to fund health and hospital services. They capped the number of doctors in this country. Labor has increased the number of training places for doctors. We have put $1.1 billion into that to increase the number of training places and to encourage more people to go into medicine and the allied health professions. We want to encourage nurses to go back into the system-into health and agedcare services. We want to try to get them working in regional and remote areas. One of the first things that the Rudd government did was to put in more money for elective surgery. About $1.6 billion was put in, in accordance with agreements with the states. The member for Dickson said that there was little or no money put into health by the Rudd government under our Nation Building and Jobs Plan. I looked around on budget night and saw him in the chamber when the Treasurer was talking about what the Rudd Labor government were doing to fund our health and hospital system. The Treasurer said: … Australians deserve a world-class health and hospital system. That is what we are providing. We are spending a lot of money not only locally in my electorate but also nationally. What we are doing under the legislation that is before the House today is in accordance with the report that was delivered on this matter. What gets me is that those on that side of the House think they have a monopoly on family values, on compassion, on heart and on care. But they do not. This legislation that is before the chamber is not about us being against women and men who struggle to have a child. It is not about that at all. gratulate the member for Cook for having two children and contributing. From what he had to say, you could tell the love, the affirmation, the care, the wonder of birth and how fantastic it is that he and his wife have had children. We are not about punishing people in these circumstances. In fact, the inconsistency here is that in 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003 and up to 2004 those opposite actually agreed with the idea of having caps on Medicare. Do not come into this place and say that by putting caps on funding we are heartless, cruel, mean and nasty. It is simply not true. Through most of the time of the Howard coalition government it supported the idea of having caps. Before the introduction of the safety net in 2004 there was a limit on the amount of government contribution for Medicare services-that is, the Medicare schedule feebut I did not hear the member for Dickson or the member for Cook say that. That was the policy of the Howard coalition government. That is what it took for most of its tenure in office. The truth is that we are doing what we need to do to save $450 million to better fund our health system, our hospital system, our roads, our schools and other sorts of things. That is what we are doing. We are not about punishing people who cannot have children. It is simply untrue for the member for Cook to come in here and say and imply that. What we are doing here is in response to a report that we had commissioned. Under the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Act 2004 the Minister for Health and Ageing tabled a report entitled the Extended Medicare safety net review report 2009 and it looked at the effectiveness, the operation and the implications of the safety net with respect to a variety of different things. The report was carried out by the Centre for Health Economics Research and Evaluation at the I conUniversity of Technology in Sydney. That report said a number of things, and I think that the report's existence and its recommendations seem to have washed over the opposition entirely. The report was very clear. What we are trying to do here is stop doctors charging excessive amounts by effectively taking advantage of the safety net. That is what the doctors are doing. We want to make sure the safety net is sustainable. The report recommended and noted a number of things which are very important to note. The report noted that the safety net had helped patients that had very high costs and reduced the out-ofpocket expenses for some patients with cancer. Nonetheless, the review showed that there were some real concerns in obstetrics and assisted reproductive technologies, including IVF and other Medicare services. The report noted that 50 per cent of safety net benefits were paid to obstetrics and assisted reproductive technologies, and the Medicare benefits had more than doubled for both of those groups since the safety net had been introduced. The reported noted that between 2003 and 2008-and the Minister for Health and Ageing has reported this in her speech-the fees charged for obstetricians for in-house hospital services went down by six per cent. However, the fees for those obstetricians outside of hospital, in private practice, and who charge people like the member for Cook and his wife, had increased by 267 per cent. How can it be possible to justify increases of that nature? Similarly, the fees charged for assisted reproductive technology services fell by nine per cent for in-house hospital services while the fees charged for out-ofhospital services increased by 62 per cent. It is very clear that some doctors were taking advantage of the safety net. It is crystal The figures say very clearly that it is the case. What are we going to do about it? Are we going to have a sustainable safety net? The unlimited nature of the benefits available through the safety net has led some doctors to take advantage. The truth is they knew that the majority of their expenses were being paid for by the taxpayers. That is what it was all about. Lest anyone says that somehow we are opposed to the safety net and that somehow we are making massive changes that will adversely affect Australians, I just point out that the government is supportive of the safety net. The truth is that the safety net operates in this way. Once an annual threshold has been met, Medicare pays 80 per cent of any future out-of-pocket expenses for all out-of-hospital services for the remainder of that calendar year. In 2009, the annual threshold for concession card holders and people who receive family tax benefit part A is $555.70. For singles and families the threshold is $1,111.60. That is indexed every year. The bill before the House allows the minister for health to determine by legislative instrument the maximum increase in benefit payable under the safety net for specified items. These are items that are specified in the Medicare Benefit Schedule. If it is not specified it does not apply. The total out-of-pocket costs incurred by a person for services will still count towards the safety net threshold amount. Once a person has reached that threshold, they will continue to be eligible to receive the benefits, equal to 80 per cent of their out-of-pocket expenses, for those items that are not specified by legislative instrument. That is what is happening. We are actually putting a cap on certain things. We are doing it to maintain the integrity and sustainability of the system. In 2008, expenditure on the clear. safety net was $414 million, 30 per cent more than in 2007. Why is that? The truth is that doctors are charging too much. That is the reality. And, if we do not do something, it is going to get out of control in such a way that the whole future operational sustainability of the safety net will be adversely affected. The government is not means-testing access to the safety net; the government is maintaining the safety net. The truth is that we are trying to get the health costs charged by doctors back under control. We are doing a lot of things when it comes to health and hospital services. In my electorate, we are bringing in a GP superclinic. We have announced that, and negotiations on that are currently underway. We are trying our best to ensure that we get more doctors in the local area. Before I was elected to this place, I was on a health community council for a long time, and we struggled to get more local doctors to the area-and Ipswich is a fast-growing area. It is growing at about four per cent per annum. It is the fastest-growing area in Queensland at the moment. We need more and more doctors and so we are seeing a lot more overseas-trained doctors in the local area. But we need to get more local doctors. We need to train more doctors and we need to spend more money locally. So the $450 million we are saving here will go a long way towards helping my community and helping the communities in the 150 electorates represented in this place. Unlike what the member for Dickson said, the Rudd government is working with the states to improve the health and hospital system in this country. Through COAG we are putting $64 billion over five years into the public hospital system in this country. That is an increase of $20 billion, nearly 50 per cent, over the previous Australian healthcare agreement and it is an indictment of the previous government for letting the health and hospital system run down. That is the reality of health and hospital systems in this country under the Howard coalition government. We are also improving participation in the health workforce as well as increasing access to health care. One of the things that I think the government has done very well is the change we are making in relation to maternity services. The 2009-10 budget included a great provision which was warmly welcomed in my electorate, and that is funding of $120.5 million for maternity services. It is a reform package that will allow women greater choice. One of the most precious things a woman can experience in life is, of course, the birth of her child. My wife tells me that she will never forget the birth of our child, and I will never forget holding my eldest daughter in my arms. It is a wonderful experience. We are not about to punish women and families in this regard by this legislation. We are giving women the option of a home birth or having their child in a hospital. That is their choice. We need to increase freedom of choice for women when it comes to the birth of their children. It is a precious and wonderful experience. So the Rudd government, through our last budget, are improving the options and opportunities for women. In this country we have a strong record in providing high-quality maternity services, and I know the women in my electorate, including those in the maternity coalition groups I have met who have been arguing for such a long time that we need to improve maternity services and improve the options for women, warmly welcome this funding. Cas MCCullough, who is very well known locally and a very well known advocate for home births, has been arguing for this for a long time. I warmly welcome this funding. I support the legislation that is before the House and, once again, I congratulate the member for Cook and his wife on the birth of their second child.",39
12,Mrs HULL ,Riverina) (1.56 pm)-It would have been kind of the member for Blair to have taken just a little bit longer! But as I am now on my feet I will take the opportunity to speak-for the three minutes before the debate is interrupted-on the issues before us with this Health Insurance Amendment (Extended Medicare Safety Net) Bill 2009.,42
13,The DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Ms AE Burke)-The member need not rush; you can speak when the debate is resumed if you want.,42
14,Mrs HULL,"I am enormously concerned about some of the services that are being capped through this legislation. The concerns that I have revolve primarily around obstetric services, assisted reproductive technology and types of cataract surgery that will be capped under this bill. I would also like to go further and speak about the concerns that I have that are not directly related to this bill but are yet to come into this House, particularly to do with cataract surgery. While only one type of cataract surgery is affected by this particular bill, there are significant issues yet to come that are associated with cataract surgery in general. In particular, there is the decision to reduce by half the payment to ophthalmologists for cataract surgery. It is an issue that ophthalmologists will have to start to contend with. Over the years, it seems that ophthalmologists and cataract surgeons have had their payments cut significantly. The schedule fee for cataract surgery in the early 1980s was around $800. In 1996 the then government cut that fee by around 30 per cent. Now this government wants to cut that fee in half again. In late 2009, I believe, the fee for cataract surgery will be cut by at least half, and that will bring the fee for doing cataract surgery back to half of what it was over 25 years ago in real dollar terms. That is still to Title Prime Minister Minister for Climate Change and Water Cabinet Secretary (Manager of Government Business in the Senate) Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Government Service Delivery Parliamentary Secretary Minister for Education Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations Minister for Social Inclusion (Deputy Prime Minister) Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth Minister for Employment Participation Parliamentary Secretary for Social Inclusion Parliamentary Secretary for Employment Treasurer come, but I think that is going to be of even greater significance than what is being put in place under this bill before us today.

17,Mr TURNBULL ,"Wentworth-Leader of the Opposition) (2.00 pm)-On indulgence, Mr Speaker, today is a momentous day in the history of our parliament and in the history of our country.

It was a period of unparalleled prosperity and unparalleled economic growth. And it could not have happened-it would never have happened-without the contribution of the member for Higgins. If I may, in this brief momentrecognising that there will be many other occasions to acknowledge the contribution of the member for Higgins at greater length and to do him greater justice-I ask you to cast your minds back to his maiden speech in 1990, when he said: When we talk of creating a fairer and more compassionate society, what do we mean? Over decades arguments have raged over which system of government best creates such a society. Some have argued that a society where government controls industry and controls and directs the production and distribution of goods is a society that is inherently more compassionate and fair. Others have argued the converse. In this century the argument has raged between those who believe that by enhancing government power it, the government, can deliver fairness and compassion to its citizens and others who have maintained that in the interests of fairness the power of ernment itself must be curtailed and the compassionate resources of our citizens released. Peter Costello, for all his years in this parliament-20 years-has stood on the side of freedom and of enterprise. He has served our nation well. We salute him and we thank him for his service.",45
19,Mr RUDD ,"Griffith-Prime Minister) (2.03 pm)- Mr Speaker, if I may I will add to those remarks, on indulgence. I am advised that the member for Higgins has indicated that he will not be seeking re-election at the next federal election, nor will he be seeking preselection for the seat of Higgins-a seat, of course, which we still hold out hopes of winning one day for the Labor Party! It was a joke, Malcolm; it was a joke! Can I say something about what is an important milestone in any member of parliament's career. We enter this place with aspirations and hopes, and all the expectations of our families, our communities and ourselves that we bring here. It is an important day when you are elected to this place. Each of us can cast our minds back to when we first stood in the House of Representatives and the enormous pride which we felt in being elected and so representing our political party and our community. There is another equally important day, and that is when we choose to exit this place, and it should be marked appropriately as well, in terms of the contributions that have been made to public life. And this is one such day in the career of a member of this place-and a most notable member at that, the member for Higgins. To have been a member of this parliament for 20 years is, of itself, a significant achievement. For that, in itself, the member should be commendedfor having represented his constituency for such an extended period of time. Secondly, for having been Treasurer of the Commongovwealth for virtually 12 years is, of itself, a further credit to the individual member's talents and abilities. He would not have been put in that position by his political party, nor nominated by my predecessor Mr Howard, had confidence not been expressed in him by his party and by the leadership of his party in his considerable intellectual skills and the policy skills which he brings to the public policy debate in Australia. And for that he should be commended as well. On top of that I will add some remarks about his contribution to Australia's place in our international economic engagements through the IMF and beyond. The Treasurer, as he was then- Mr Costello, the member for Higgins-was Australia's representative on the IMF and, through his occupancy of that position, other international financial institutions for which Australia has representation. I would make two particular points about the IMF. One is that in the deliberations following the Asian financial crisis in 1997-98, the decision at that stage to establish the G20 finance ministers meeting was something in which the member for Higgins-the Treasurer as he was at the timeplayed a role. The establishment of the G20 finance ministers meeting from that time on, and the events of the last 12 months in turn, provided a platform through which we, together with other governments, were able to elevate it to a heads of government meeting. That is now the G20 summit, which served this nation well in the meeting held in Washington at the end of last year and in London most recently, and will again, prospectively, in Pittsburgh this September. It has been an important vehicle for global economic governance. It had its foundations in the fact that we did have a body established at the finance ministers and treasurers level across 20 of the world's leading economies back then. In those deliberations at the time, the Treasurer, as he was then, the member for Higgins, played a significant role. The further point I would make in that respect is that off the back of the Asian financial crisis at the time, significant decisions were made here to intervene and support various of our neighbouring economies that were experiencing difficulties-from memory, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Republic of Korea. Decisions were taken by the then government, led by the Treasurer, as he was then, to provide significant offers of financial assistance to assist those economies through that difficult time. These were correct decisions in the national interest. They were correct decisions as good neighbours of these countries. And they were correct decisions, I would remind the House, which are not forgotten today. The fact that we have good relations with the countries which I have just listed is in part anchored by decisions taken back then, and I would like to make appropriate recognition of that in the House today. I will make one final point about the importance of family in a place like this. The nearly 20 years that the member for Higgins has been in this House-as other members who have been here for an extended period of time will understand-has obviously been an extraordinary burden for his wife, his partner, as well as his children to bear. That is a burden which those of us who have been here for some time fully recognise and understand. I would say to the member for Higgins, on behalf of his confreres and great mates here in the Australian Labor Party, that we wish him well and we wish his family well, after what has been a quite extraordinary career in Australian public life.",46
20,Mr COSTELLO ,"Higgins) (2.09 pm)On indulgence, Mr Speaker, may I say I did not think I would ever see the day where both sides of this parliament would say nice things about me! It is just possible that both sides of the dispatch box are happy with the announcement that I have made. I want to thank both the Leader of the Liberal Party, Malcolm Turnbull, and the Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, for their very kind words. Woody Allen was once asked what he hoped to hear people say at his funeral, and he said, ‘As I'm lying there at my funeral I would hope to hear somebody say, “Look, he's still moving!”' It is a very nice thing to come here, not being quite departed, and hear the kinds of speeches one usually only hears as eulogies. In fact, I might come back tomorrow for a little more, I am enjoying it so much! The Prime Minister, rightly, I think, talked about Australia's role in the formation of the G20. The G20 would not have happened without Australia. It brought together the developed world and the developing world, and Australia as neither-we came in as an honest broker because we stood in Asia's hour of need as the only country, along with Japan, that came to the rescue of those crisis affected economies. I do not need to say that, from our perspective, a seat at the table which represents 90 per cent of global GDP is a very, very important diplomatic position for us and for our country. It has moved up a notch now with the leader's summit. I think the role that it played when it was convened by President Bush and also by Prime Minister Gordon Brown shows just how important it is. I do think that this is something Australia must never let go of. There will be others that will try and refashion a G-something else-a G8, a G7, a G13, a G14. Bear in mind the G20 is a forum where Australia can play a role, and it always has. We have chaired it; we have hosted it here in Australia. It will be integral, I think, to the shape the future global economy. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for mentioning our achievements in the economic sphere. Of course, those on the other side will not want to refer to them as much, for obvious reasons, but I will make one point. It is a point I have actually made in the new chapter of the forthcoming paperback edition of my book. I do not know if I mentioned that the hardback copy has sold out, and we are publishing a paperback edition with a new chapter. The point I have made is that the strength of Australia's position in terms of its debt-to-GDP ratio has nothing to do with the journey in the last year but everything to do with the starting point. If we had not had a starting point of a net negative debt-that is, an asset position-then our debt position would be ending up where the Europeans, the Americans and the British are. It was the strength of the starting point that gave Australia ammunition that could be unloaded and unlocked in the current situation. Every now and then it is worth paying credit to the people who put in place important reforms before your time. None of us come to politics in the year zero. There is always something that has gone on before. I have always paid credit, because I think they were right, to Hawke and Keating for the liberalisation of the financial markets and the cutting of tariffs, and there are things that we could also be given credit for, I think, by the current government. It will make Australia stronger if we do that. In that maiden speech that I gave so many years ago I said these words: ‘I believe in the parliament.' And I do, and, although it was my privilege to be a minister for a very long period of time, the parliament is still important. There is no person in this place that is not important. Everybody had something that got them here and got them elected and eveof rybody has a view that has to be listened to. We are lucky to have a parliament. That is why I very consciously decided after the election that I would stay in the parliamentbecause the parliament is an institution that should be preserved and valued, not just the ministry. It has been my privilege to be in this parliament for 20 years-what I consider the best years of my life. I also want to say I think Australia's best years can still be in front of it. This is still a young country with wonderful opportunity and, properly governed, there are greater things in store for us. The Prime Minister was very generous in his words. I thank him for those words. On this occasion he did not come the raw prawn; he gave a fair suck of the sauce bottle! And I appreciate the statement that he gave. Family means everything to me. You cannot imagine the strength that a strong family gives a person. I thank my family and my colleagues, my branch members and my electorate committee for everything they have given me. It has been an honour and a privilege to serve in this parliament. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE Interest Rates",47
21,Mr TURNBULL ,"2.15 pm)-My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Commonwealth Bank's claim that its recent rate rise was caused by an increase in its own long-term wholesale borrowing costs. Given the increase in long-term rates is directly related to the massive explosion in government debt, doesn't the Prime Minister accept that it is his reckless spending and debt binge which is pushing up interest rates?",48
22,Mr RUDD,I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Let's go to the facts of what the Commonwealth Bank actually said. They said: The cheaper funding we had … prior to the crisis is rolling off and is being replaced by more expensive source of funding. The cost of raising funds from offshore wholesale markets was still 12 times higher than it was before the credit crisis. That is: offshore. Mr Hockey interjectingMONICA,49
23,Mr RUDD,"Let me go to the issue of offshore wholesale markets. Firstly, the cost of bank finance, as the member for North Sydney would be aware, is set in offshore global markets. Presently, in offshore bond markets we have something like $84 trillion on issue. The fraction of that which the Australian bond market, the Australian debt market, issues is 0.001. That is fact 1. Let us just put that into some context. Secondly, the honourable member asks about the impact of Australian government actions in relation to rates. Can I say that one of the principal decisions taken by the government, for which we were criticised by many of those opposite, was the decision to provide a guarantee on interbank lending in the wholesale finance market to banks. I would draw the honourable member's attention to the following. On 12 December 2008 the CBA issued guaranteed bonds at a total price, including the 70 basis point guarantee price, of 160 basis points above the bank bill swap rate. As of 14 April 2009that is, after the government's guarantee came into operation-the spread on the CBA issue was down to 123 basis points. In fact, if you look more broadly at the impact on money market spreads as a consequence of the government's direct intervention in the marketplace to support banks with the interbank guarantee, it runs as follows: following the collapse of Lehman Brothers the spread increased to 142 basis points; after the government introduced the guarantees credit spreads had fallen to 80 basis points by the end of November, to 75 basis points by the this end of December, to 34 basis points by the end of March and to 21 basis points by the end of May. I would suggest that the honourable member reflects on that in terms of the basis of his question as well. The other thing I would draw to the honourable member's attention is the relevance of the government's actions in the marketplace to support the interbank guarantee in terms of the banks actual take-up of this guarantee in their international borrowing. And I would draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that, in the crisis period of October-November last year, interbank lending effectively collapsed to virtually zero. In fact, the total raisings by Australian banks in November last year were $0.14 billion-that is, practically zero. After we introduced the guarantee-which came into operation, from recollection, Treasurer, in early December-we had those raisings increase to $23 billion, $28 billion, $19 billion, $8 billion et cetera. But here is the critical point for the benefit of the honourable member who has asked the question: the extent to which the banks have relied upon the guarantee for their actual raisings. In December last year 98 per cent of the overall raisings by the banks were underpinned by the government guarantee; in February it was 93 per cent, in March it was 86 per cent, in April it was 65 per cent and in May it was 53 per cent. In terms of the normalisation of credit markets-that is, assisting banks to raise money offshore-from where we had collapsed to zero in November last year, we have had a restoration to these levels of raisings. Most critically, more then half since then-and, in the early months, practically all-have depended upon the government guarantee, producing the contraction in spreads that I referred to before. Therefore, I would suggest to the honourable member as to the basis of his question: (1) Australia's public bond issue represents a fraction of 0.001 of the total bond issue which is alive globally-and it is the global bond market that shapes the offshore financial markets which determine credit price (2) spreads have changed and (3) banks have relied upon the actions of this government. Finally, I ask the honourable member who has asked this question about interest rates simply reflect on where interest rates stood under the previous government as opposed to where they stand under this government. Under the previous government we had 10 interest rates rises in a row-a total rise of 250 basis points, costing an average family more than $400 per month-and interest rates were at their highest point in a decade. That is what we inherited. I would contrast that with those opposite in the following way: since the government have been in office families have benefited from six interest rate cuts-a total of 425 basis points-and interest rates are now at their lowest point in more than 50 years, which will save the average family with a $300,000 mortgage around $750 a month, or $9,000 a year. So I suggest to the honourable member that he look at some basic comparisons. Let us look at where the CBA rate stood when the Liberals left office-at 8.55 per cent. Where does it stand today? At 5.74 per cent. That represents a fundamental difference between interest rates as the existed under the previous government and where they exist today. Therefore, I would suggest to the honourable gentlemen that, when he poses questions like this, he reflect upon (a) interest rate performance under the previous government relative to what is occurring now (b) how interest rates and the cost of capital are actually shaped by offshore credit markets, as underpinned in the correct rendering of the statement by the CBA and (c) the impact that the government guarantee has had on spreads and on the actual uptake of interbank lending courtesy of the government's provision of that guarantee, which was much criticised. I will conclude by saying this: as those opposite talk about the impact of the 10 basis point rise by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, on which point the Treasurer and I to and others have reflected the government's fundamental disappointment, those opposite, and the Leader of the Opposition in particular, should reflect carefully on what he had to say when there was a 25 basis point rise not all that long ago. When interest rates went up in August 2006 by 25 basis points the Leader of the Opposition said at the time, ‘I think the interest rate hike has been overdramatised.' Furthermore, on the question of interest rates, the Leader of the Opposition has also said much more recently-I think as shadow Treasurer: Banks are free to price their products as they wish. After all, they are in the business of making profits and, all things being equal, they will charge as much for every product they have on offer as the market will allow them. That is obviously the philosophy-the free market fundamentalist philosophyrepresented by the Leader of the Opposition. He says that that is what occurs out there in interest rate markets. I would suggest that the Leader of the Opposition reflect carefully (a) on what he has said about how interest rate markets operate (b) on the relative performance of interest rate pricing and cost under the government of which he was a part for such a long period of time as compared to what applies now and (c) how actual prices are set. DISTINGUISHED VISITORS",49
24,The SPEAKER ,"2.24 pm)-I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the government of the Republic of Rwanda, the Hon. Mrs Rosemary Museminali and also the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the government of the Republic of Kenya, the Hon. Moses Wetangula. On behalf of the House I extend to both of you a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE Economy",51
25,Mr CHEESEMAN ,2.24 pm)-My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the government's nation building for recovery program to drive Australia out of the worse global cession in 75 years?,51
26,Mr RUDD,"I thank the honourable member for this question. The government has embarked on a course of action based on early and decisive action to support jobs and to cushion our economy from the worse impacts of the global recession. I refer the attention of the House to what we had produced in the last week in terms of the most recent consumer sentiment index, which was up 12 per cent in June. This is the largest increase in 22 years. Consumer sentiment is now up 20 per cent since the announcement of the government's first economic stimulus package in October and, furthermore, the consumer sentiment index is now at its highest level since January 2008. That covers consumer sentiment, but then, of course, we have business confidence, which has also risen. Business confidence for May showed the sharpest rise that we have seen since 1989. It has now reached its highest level since February 2008. Furthermore, we saw other positive economic data in the housing sector, with housing finance growing by 3.5 per cent in April. First home buyers in particular represent an increased proportion of that total amount, indicating that people are responding positively to the trebling of the first home owners boost. I was asked by the honourable member about the economic recovery-that is, our efforts to support an economic recovery in Australia and to lift Australia from the global economic recession. The data suggests that as of now-while there are still many difficulties lying ahead-Australia is performing better than most other countries during this global recession, the worse in three-quarters of a century. Firstly, on the matter of economic growth, if you look at the data itself, Australia has the fastest growth in the OECD. In the March quarter we saw the folrelowing growth in some other economies: Japan, negative 3.8 per cent; the UK, negative 1.9 per cent; the US, negative 1.5 per cent; Canada, negative 1.4 per cent; France, negative 1.2 per cent; Germany, negative 3.8 per cent; Italy, negative 2.6 per cent; and Australia grew in the March quarter by 0.4 per cent. Against those measures the Australian economy is performing relatively well. On unemployment, Australia on the most recent data has the second lowest unemployment of the major advanced economies: in the UK it is 7.1 per cent; the US, 9.4 per cent; Canada, 8.4 per cent; France, 9.1 per cent; Germany, 8.2 per cent; Italy, 6.9 per cent; in Australia it is 5.7 per cent-still too high-and in Japan it is 5 per cent. On debt, Australia has the lowest net debt of the major advanced economies. To again go through the numbers: Japan, 103 per cent of GDP; the UK, 56.8 per cent; the US, 61.7 per cent; Canada, 26.2 per cent; France, 65.2 per cent; Germany, 70.9 per cent; Italy, 111.9 per cent; and the major economies have an average of 70.4 per cent of GDP. Australia's debt is currently forecast to be 4.6 per cent 2009-10 rising to 13.8 per cent. On the matters of deficits, Australia has a lower budget deficit than the average of the major advanced economies in 2009. The figures are: Japan, minus 9.9 per cent; the UK, 9.8 per cent; the US, 13.6 per cent; France, 6.2 per cent; Germany, 4.7 per cent; Italy, 5.5 per cent; and their average is 10.4 per cent. Canada is at minus 3.4 per cent and Australia is at minus 4.9 per cent. NA down?",51
27,Mr RUDD,"The member for Sturt is obviously not keen on hearing this data. But it is important that the House reflect on the fact that every one of the major advanced economies has fallen into recession and Australia has not. I say to those opposite that, therefore, when it comes to economic growth, Australia is the fastest among the major advanced economies and with unemployment we have the second lowest of the major advanced economies. On top of that our net debt is the lowest of the major advanced economies and our deficit is the lowest of the average of the major advanced economies. These are the data which represent the impact not just of government policy action but also of the decisive contribution by individuals in the Australian economy as well-the men and women of business and small business in particular. We have some 35,000 construction projects currently underway across the country. These are important projects for the nation. I notice in this respect that there is a debate within the Australian community about the future of the nation's construction sector. The building and construction sector is critical for the economy. While this sector is full of hard working and law-abiding people helping Australia to build towards recovery, there are also plainly problems. There has been a hisin tory of violence and threats of violence in parts of this sector and these cannot be ignored and nor will they be ignored. There is a determination within the Australian government to get this right. We will honour our election commitments and have indeed a tough cop on the beat. We will honour this commitment in a fair and responsible way for the sector, for the economy and also, most importantly, to support economic recovery. We are not out of the woods yet. There is much work to be done. The government's strategy is to lift the economy up through nation building for recovery. I would again contrast that with the strategy embraced by those opposite, which is to continue to talk the economy down. Budget",52
28,Mr HOCKEY ,2.30 pm)-My question is to the Treasurer. I refer to the government's claim that its massive debt burden is responsible for job creation and has nothing at all to do with rising interest rates. Will the Treasurer now release all Treasury modelling that is used to justify his claims that this huge taxpayer debt is supporting jobs?,52
29,Mr SWAN,"I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. He is acutely embarrassed by the jobs performance of our stimulus package. It is playing a vital role in supporting employment in the Australian economy. Both he and the Leader of the Opposition were acutely embarrassed when the national accounts figures came out the week before last, because what they showed was that it was our stimulus that was promoting growth, employment and business in the Australian community. When you listen to the shadow Treasurer, you would think that there was some alternative. We have this dishonest campaign about deficits and borrowing when the truth is that we know that they would borrow not one cent less than us and that they would not pay it back one day earlier. We know that. Last Sunday week, there was an embarrassing performance by the shadow Treasurer with Laurie Oakes. Laurie Oakes asked him this: But, if you'd been in government, you also would have lost $210 billion from your forward estimates wouldn't you? So, do you concede that you would have had to borrow that amount if you were in government? The shadow Treasurer replied: No way Laurie, no way. What a completely ridiculous claim: ‘There's no global recession; it has no impact on the revenues. No way, Laurie; no loss of revenue at all.' Laurie Oakes went on to ask him this very obvious question: So you'd be spending $210 billion less over that period? The shadow Treasurer replied: No, no, not at all. NA of order on relevance. The question very specifically asked whether the Treasurer would release the Treasury modelling that they use to justify their job creation claims. Even the Treasurer must recognise that his answer is ranging a long way from the question that he was asked.",52
30,The SPEAKER,"The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The preamble of the question related to debt levels, job creation and interest rates.",53
31,Mr SWAN,"Exactly. And it relates to the level of borrowings that this government has had to make responsibly to support our economy and to support employment in the middle of a global recession. Mr Oakes said: So you'd be spending $210 billion less over that period? Hockey said: No, no, not at all. So there would be no global recession, they would have less deficit and debt and they would be able to do that without spending a cent less. Talk about a magic pudding! The truth is that we have had to borrow responsibly to cover the revenue collapse brought on in this country-imposed on this country-by a global recession and to support employment to give us the outcomes that we got in the national accounts the week before last and to give us the consumer confidence figures that the Prime Minister was talking about before. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. I just asked the Treasurer to release the basis of his claims. Just release it; he uses it all the time. Just release it.",53
32,The SPEAKER,"The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. As I suggested to the member for Sturt, the Treasurer is responding to the question.",53
33,Mr SWAN,"What we saw in the embarrassment on Laurie Oakes's program is that there is no alternative policy. None of them-not one of the entire front-bench-has an alternative policy. All they have is a dishonest scare campaign about deficit and debt. It is about time that they came clean and admitted that if they were in government they would have to borrow as much as the government has had to borrow to support employment in the Australian economy. But they are so opportunistic. They are so concerned with their own political futures that they are not concerned with the national interest. We published for everybody to see in our budget all of our figures; all of our estimates. Because they are inconvenient for their fake political position, they cannot wear them. On this side of the House, we are proud of the budget that we brought down. We are proud of the role that it is playing in supportbeen ing employment. There are 200,000 more Australians in employment as a consequence of our budget. That is 200,000-plus people in employment who would not have been in employment if it had not been for our budget. That is their embarrassment; that is what they cannot admit to. That is why their dishonest campaign is there for everybody to see. Building the Education Revolution Program",53
34,Ms BIRD ,"2.36 pm)-My question is to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on recent media reports about the Building the Education Revolution program?",54
35,Ms GILLARD,"I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. I know that she would be very delighted that jobs in her local economy are being supported through the economic stimulus plan. There are over 1,133 projects in her electorate, and 87 of these projects are at 61 of her local schools under the Building the Education Revolution program. This contribution in Cunningham is part of the biggest school modernisation program the nation has ever seen. Over the next 12 months there will be 23,000 projects in about 9,500 schools around the country-a huge national effort to support jobs today whilst we build the infrastructure we need for tomorrow. Mr Speaker, you and others in the House may have seen some recent publicity about the guidelines for the Building the Education Revolution and some claims relating to expenditure in particular schools. Can I make this position very clear for the House: the guidelines for the Building the Education Revolution are clear; they are available publicly on the website; and they have certainly absorbed by school communities who want to benefit their schools under this program. In particular, the Building the Education Revolution guidelines have required that, wherever it is possible, local tradespeople are engaged for the work. Preference must also be given to businesses that have demonstrated a commitment to adding or retaining trainees and apprentices. The guidelines also state that, wherever possible, new buildings and refurbishments should incorporate sustainable building principles and be designed to maximise energy efficiency. The guidelines are also clear that, for planned amalgamations, the indicative funding allocation for the school to be merged can be combined and used for capital or refurbishments in the new school. We are working cooperatively with state and territory authorities and with the independent and Catholic school systems to deliver this huge modernisation program. Opposition members interjectingMONICA",54
36,Ms GILLARD,"The opposition are catcalling about this because they do not support and have never supported this investment in schools. Mr Speaker, you may have seen, as other members of the parliament may have seen, some very specific claims made on 12 June in the Australian, where it was alleged that funding was being handed to schools slated for closure or amalgamation. NA",54
37,Ms GILLARD,"I hear the shadow minister yell out ‘Gepps Cross'. I am coming to that in just a moment, and he will be very interested in the facts. Firstly, the guidelines in relation to schools that are due to be closed or amalgamated are clearNA",54
38,The SPEAKER,The member for Sturt!,54
39,Ms GILLARD,"The member for Sturt will be very interested in the answer, given his interjections. He should just wait one little minute and some things will become clear to him. The guidelines are clear in relation to schools that are due to be closed or amalgamated. NA",55
40,The SPEAKER,The member for Sturt should wait quietly.,55
41,Ms GILLARD,"No funding is going to schools that are in the process of, or were planned for, closure. The guidelines in this respect are exactly the same as those of the Investing in Our Schools guidelinesexactly the same. Of course, states and territories and block grant authorities were asked to advise the Commonwealth of any schools earmarked for closure when they provided their enrolment data to the Commonwealth in February 2009. In some cases when we published the names of successful schools under the Building the Education Revolution, the state, in their application, named school that was amalgamating. Let me just make the facts very, very clear-so clear that the oppositionNA",55
42,Ms GILLARD,"The member for Sturt will now be very interested in this fact, and he will come to the dispatch box and no doubt apologise for that interjection. Let me make the facts very clear. The Australian reported on 12 June that Inala West State School, which is amalgamating with Inala State School, would be receiving $125,000 for classroom upgrades. The fact is that, as Inala West State School is to be closed and amalgamated with Inala State School, 100 per cent of the funding will go to Inala State School-the continuing school-for classroom upgrades. The Australian reported on 12 June that Richlands State School, which is amalgamating with Richlands East State School, would be receiving $75,000 for classroom upgrades. The fact is that 100 per cent of this funding will go to Richlands East State School-the school that is continuing. The Australian reported on 12 June that Dinmore State School, which is amalgamating with Riverview State School, would be receiving $75,000 for classroom upgrades. The fact is that 100 per cent of this funding will go to Riverview State School-the school that is continuing. The Australian reported on 12 June that Bremer State High School, which is moving to a new site, would be receiving $200,000 for revegetation and a fitness track. The fact is that these facilities are for the new site. The Australian reported on 12 JuneNA",55
43,The SPEAKER,The member for Sturt!,55
44,Ms GILLARD,"and I am sure the shadow minister will be interested in thisthat Gepps Cross Primary School, before it merges into a new superschool in 18 months the time, will be receiving $125,000 to be spent on fixing a toilet block. The fact is that the Building the Education Revolution funds for Gepps Cross Primary School were approved for information and communication technology at the amalgamated site and the funds will be used for this purpose. The South Australian Department of Education and Children's Services has advised my department that the school will not be using any Building the Education Revolution funds to fix toilets and drainage and that any maintenance for toilets and drainage would be funded by the state government. The fact hereNA",55
45,The SPEAKER,The member for Sturt is warned!,55
46,Ms GILLARD,"Obviously the shadow minister for education, caring nothing about education, does not want to listen to the answer-and the facts are perfectly clear. These vital resources are being delivered to schools which are continuing and which will educate students. The members of the opposition might think that is something to be laughed about; they might think that building 21st century infrastructure for Australian schools is all a bit of joke; they might is appropriate to come into this House and vote against it; they might think it is appropriate to go on the media and describe it as a low-quality spend; and then they might have the hypocrisy to try and get themselves in the photo when these funds are announced at local schools. But the Australian community know that this program is benefiting local schools, building the infrastructure they need for the 21st century and supporting local jobs. This is a huge national mobilisation effort-$14.7 billion is unashamedly being delivered quickly to support jobs today during the global recession. People of goodwill around the country are turning their hands to make sure that this money is delivered in the form of construction sites and that it supports jobs right around the country. We will continue to work with those people of goodwill. We understand that from time to time in a program of this size there will be complaints and concerns. We have responded to a number of those. All we ask in the course of this process is that people of goodwill continue to work together to get the program delivered, and obviously we would prefer if, when reporting on these matters, there was some accuracy in the reports.",55
47,Mr TURNBULL ,"2.45 pm)-My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to Mr John Grant, who has supplied him with a free car for almost all of the time he has been Leader of the Labor Party, and to the Prime Minister's answer in question timeGovernment members interjecting Ms Gillard-Is that your big attack on the economy?",56
48,The SPEAKER,Order! The Leader of think it the Opposition has the call.,56
49,Mr TURNBULL,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, I will start again. I refer the Prime Minister to Mr John Grant, who has supplied him with a free car for almost all of the time he has been Leader of the Labor Party, and to the Prime Minister's answer in question time on 4 June when he most indignantly denied that he or his office had spoken to Mr Grant in relation to OzCar, the taxpayer funded finance company, or had made any representations on behalf of Mr Grant. Does the Prime Minister stand by this denial?",56
50,Mr RUDD,"My answer is as it was the last time the honourable member raised this question because that is the advice I have received from my office. Furthermore, can I say to the honourable member that, since this particular vehicle was provided by the individual concerned, the declaration on pecuniary interest was made. The ute was valued at around $5,000; it was put in my pecuniary interest statement on 3 July 2007, as is required by the Commonwealth parliament. Furthermore, I would say to the honourable member that, in terms of representations that have been made by various members in this place, I am also advised that in addition to the car dealer from Sydney who spoke to me, Mr Kaplan, from Hunter Holden in Sydney, OzCar which I referred to the other day in answer to the honourable member's question, there have also been representations to the government from the member for Riverina, the member for Dunkley, the member for Murray and, of course, the member for Dawson as well. It is entirely normal for representations to be made to OzCar because this is the sort of thing that members of parliament are required to do if they are asked to actually get out there and support the industry. The reason this particular facility existed was that we were approached as a government by the industry at the end of 2008 about the collapse in normal supplies of motor vehicle finance. As a consequence of that, the government took the view that a coinvestment vehicle, a special-purpose vehicle, between ourselves and the banks was an appropriate way to step into the marketplace and to provide, therefore, an alternative source of finance. We have also been advised that, had we not done so, the impact that would have had in terms of confidence across the industry would have been significant. Therefore, I would say this has been a worthwhile measure on the part of the government, and any member of this place, if they are approached by a business seeking to access a government program, would be entirely entitled to make representations. go back to the honourable member's question: the advice that I received from my office remains current on the matter which the honourable member raises. Economy",56
51,Mr RAGUSE ,"2.48 pm)-My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline the House the estimated cost to the economy and the budget of not acting to support up to 210,000 jobs?",57
52,Mr SWAN,"I thank the member for Forde for his very important question. It is the case that the No. 1 priority of the government is jobs-to support Australian jobs in the face of this most savage global recession. Of course, the economic stimulus that we have put in place is expected to reduce the forecast peak in the unemployment rate by 1½ percentage points and it will support up to 210,000 more jobs over the period ahead. That is something the government is very proud of. It is important for us to invest in nation-building infrastructure, to support employment and to support business given the fact that there is a withdrawal of private investment and given the collapse in the terms of trade-the dramatic reduction in national income. All of those reasons make it very important that our stimulus, through phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3, continues. That means we do need to borrow responsibly to support employment and to support Australian businesses. The fact that 210,000 Australian families with breadwinners benefit from that is very important. We should not underestimate the cost to the economy if the unemployment rate were to go up even higher. Treasury estimate that, without economic stimulus, total employee incomes over the next decade would be around $100 billion lower. As a result, budget revenues from less income tax alone would be about $23 billion lower. Of course, spending on unemployBut to ment benefits would be about $4 billion higher over the next four years and of course the number of long-term unemployed would be higher. All of those things come at a tremendous cost to the economy. But, in this discussion about stimulus and what it does, we should also focus on the to human cost of unemployment-what cost is passed on to the economy through the breakup of families and through the impact on local communities. Every job lost is one too many, which is why the government is so determined to put in place its economic stimulus to support employment and to support businesses. We have heard in the House, particularly from the Deputy Prime Minister earlier, just how important the investment is in schools and just how important the investment is in social housing, in clean energy and so on-to support employment while at the same time leaving a lasting legacy for the country. This government is absolutely determined to be on the front foot, to put in place positive plans for the future so that it can support employment and make our economy and country a far better place. OzCar",57
53,Mr TURNBULL ,2.51 pm)-My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to his statement in question time on 4 June that Mr John Grant's representations in relation to OzCar were referred to Treasury as the responsible agency for this taxpayer funded finance company. Will the Treasurer advise the House what manner of assistance his office requested Treasury officials were to give to Mr Grant?,58
54,Mr SWAN,Mr Grant approached my office. He was referred to a departmental liaison officer who then referred him on to the relevant section of the department. Mr Grant would have received the same assistance as any other car dealer who was referred through that process received. Economy,58
55,Mr BRADBURY ,2.52 pm)-My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. How have the government's stimulus measures helped to support the Australian economy and why is it important for these measures to receive broad support from all parts of the community?,58
56,Mr TANNER,"I think the member for Lindsay for his question. Could I also wish the member for Higgins well on his departure. It is always a sad day when parliament loses a dedicated Essendon supporter, although the Minister for Trade may not agree with that, and I wish him well. The government has put in place an economic strategy built around stimulating economic activity in various sections of the economy in order to take up the slack being left by the global contraction that is hitting the entire world. doing so, we are sustaining approximately 210,000 jobs and countless businesses that otherwise would go under as a result of the global recession. That stimulus is going through payments as to maintenance of school buildings, construction of new school buildings, construction of new homes and construction of new road, rail and other projects. That stimulus strategy has received widespread support throughout the community including from most sections of the business community. But, sadly, that support has not been universal. It is particularly disappointing that the opposition not only has refused to support the government's economic stimulus strategy but has continued to snipe at it in an even more hysterical and unfounded way. But last Friday the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, broke his own previous world record for silliness when he blamed the Commonwealth Bank's increase of 0.1 per cent in its interest rates on the government's stimulus package. I note that this was coming from a former cabinet minister from a party that when in government promised to keep interest rates at record lows and then delivered 10 interest rate increases in a row. I note also that a respected economics commentator and member of the press gallery described these claims as ‘bizarre garbage'. I think that is a very apt description of the accusation that the shadow Treasurer made. The factor that has been driving the separation of market interest rates from official Reserve Bank of Australia interest rates over the past 12 months or so is universally acknowledged as the turbulence on international financial markets, on global financial markets. That is certainly the reason that the Commonwealth Bank has advanced for the position that it has taken with respect to its market interest rates: the higher cost of In wholesale funding flowing through from international financial markets into market interest rates in Australia. In effect, the position being taken by the shadow Treasurer and being endorsed implicitly by the Leader of the Opposition today says that projected Australian government borrowing, the vast bulk of which has yet to occur, is pushing up interest rates in global financial markets and that is crowding out private sector activity in global financial markets. Any examination of the facts will demonstrate that this cannot be the case because the Australian proportion of total global government borrowing is extremely small, as the Prime Minister outlined before, and Australia has the lowest projected debt profile of all of the major developed economies in the world. It is interesting to note, if you want to follow their arguments and if you want to follow through the logic of some of their statements, and also it is always worth referring back to what the opposition said a little while ago. In effect, what they are saying at the moment is that the government is borrowing in order to finance stimulus payments and that that borrowing is crowding out the ability of Australia's banks to finance lending and as a result they have to push up interest rates. It is not that long ago that an opposition member stood here telling us that those same payments were not going to be spent. They were going to be saved. They were going to end up with the banks. They were going to end up in people's bank accounts. So somehow or other the banks are losing money as a result of borrowing for the stimulus payments which are ending up with the banks, according to the position of the opposition. The same person has also said that, should the opposition be elected and were it in office tomorrow, it would maintain the government's stimulus strategy. With Laurie Oakes eight days ago, when asked about this issue, the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, said that it was hard to unscramble the egg and that the opposition, were it to become the government tomorrow, would maintain the government's stimulus strategy. The shadow Treasurer has a habit, unfortunately, of saying whatever pops into his head irrespective of substance, rigour and any kind of content. Mr Hockey-What am I thinking now? What am I thinking now, Lindsay? Ms Gillard-‘When's Malcolm Turnbull retiring?'-that's what you're thinking.",58
57,Mr TANNER,"That is right. There are two people who are very glad you are going, Peter, and they are both on that side. In the same interview with Laurie Oakes eight days ago, the member for North Sydney accused the government of ‘spending record levels on advertising'. I thought I had entered a parallel universe on that Sunday morning. It was early in the morning and I was a bit concerned about my state of mind. I thought I had better check the facts. The facts are these: in calendar 2007 total spending on government campaign advertising, $254 million; in the 2008 calendar year total spending on government campaign advertising, $87 million-in other words, barely a third of the record level set by the former government of which the shadow Treasurer was a member. In conclusion, I would like to draw the House's attention to the shadow Treasurer's solution to the problem that he believes is there with government spending and borrowing crowding out the private sector. He says, ‘The government should spend less money.' Now, there is a slight problem with that. There is something of a problem as those opposite have yet to nominate a single savings proposal in 18 months-not one. They say they would continue with the government's stimulus payments were they in office tomorrow. They continue to block government savings initiatives in the Senate and, of course, they keep dropping out expensive new promises on top of that. So for them, as the opposition, to suggest that the government should be spending less money would be slightly more credible were they to actually act in opposition in the same way as we did and put forward savings proposals, as the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and I did in opposition prior to the 2007 election. It is time that the opposition put the shadow Treasurer out of his misery. I used to think it was crook that they had a shadow Treasurer who nicked other people's lines. I have now worked out there is one thing even worse. That is someone who makes up his own. Building the Education Revolution Program NA the Minister for Education. I refer the minister to the Hastings Public School in New South Wales, which was granted $400,000 for a covered outdoor learning area under the schools stimulus debacle. Given that the Hastings Public School built a similar covered outdoor learning area for just $40,000 in 2003-this represents a tenfold leap in just six years-what action will the minister take to stamp out waste and mismanagement in the schools stimulus debacle?",59
58,Ms GILLARD,"I thank the shadow minister for his question, because it proves yet again how little the Liberal Party cares about education in this country. On the specific school that he raises, I will of course investiIf gate the details of this matter, but can I say this: the track record of the Liberal Party in raising accurate claims in this House is a very poor one indeed. Given that we have already had questions from the Liberal opposition which, when investigated, turned out to be completely incorrect, I will not accept any fact asserted by the shadow minister without having it thoroughly checked. So we will undertake those checks. The shadow minister might think it is smart, as a representative of the Liberal Party, to go around the country insulting school communities on the work that is happening in their schools. The Leader of the Opposition might think it is smart to vote against $14.7 billion going into local schools and all of the support for local jobs that that provides. But, if they ever got out of their Liberal Party bubble and went to a school and spoke to some real human beings about what is happening in their school, they would find a sense of delight about the possibilities for better quality education that this program brings. I personally have visited schools. I have addressed principals forums where we have talked through Building the Education Revolution and where principals, teachers, parents and, indeed, students themselves have been delighted about the possibility that it brings to their school and the support that it brings to their local community. Here we are in the parliament and what we hear constantly from the opposition is carping, moaning and criticism, just like we are hearing now. What we never hear from the shadow minister for education is an education policy-not once, not ever. NA der under the standing orders: the minister was asked a very specific question about profiteering. She is now engaging in rhetoric. she does not know the answer off the top of her head, she should simply sit down.",60
59,The SPEAKER,Order! The Deputy Prime Minister is responding to the question.,60
60,Ms GILLARD,"In conclusion, the government will get on with delivering its education revolution. I wait for policy statements from the shadow minister. When he makes those policy statements, I think that they should include answers to the following: if the Liberal Party were elected at the next election, would they stop Building the Education Revolution? If the Liberal Party were elected at the next election, would they stop the national curriculum process? If the Liberal Party were elected at the next election, would they stop the extra money that we provided for primary schools recurrent for government schools? If the Liberal Party were elected at the next election, would they stop our national partnerships for disadvantaged schools? If the Liberal Party were elected at the next election, would they stop our half-billion-dollar investment in and numeracy? If the Liberal Party were elected at the next election, would they stop our $550 million investment in teacher quality? If the Liberal Party were elected at the next election, would they stop our investment in universal preschools? If the Liberal Party were elected at the next election, would they stop the delivery of more than 700,000 more productivity places? If the Liberal Party were elected at the next election, would they stop the Bradley reforms? I await the answers. Infrastructure",60
61,Ms SAFFIN ,"3.05 pm)-My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. Will the minister please update the House on the rollout of the government's record investment in regional infrastructure and on how it is being received by regional representatives?",61
62,Mr ALBANESE,"I thank the member for Page for her question. More than $21 billion of the $35 billion we have set aside for transport infrastructure will be spent in regional and rural Australia. The member for Page will certainly be pleased-I am not quite so sure about the member for Cowper-that I have announced today that detailed engineering work will start this week on the $618 million Kempsey bypass. That will enable construction work to commence at the beginning of next year, creating some 450 direct jobs, as well as many indirect jobs, in Kempsey on the North Coast of New South Wales. I am asked about how the investment in regional Australia is being received. Certainly, a number of National Party representatives have had a say about this project-which they could not get around to doing in 12 long years-that it is long overdue. This is a direct piece of self-criticism from the National Party representatives, inliteracy cluding the member for Cowper. Regional representatives have also had a bit to say. The Vice-President of the National Farmers Federation has said: Transport infrastructure investment, including road and port funding, is welcomed. He said that in a statement that the NFF put out supporting this government's record funding in regional Australia. I am asked about other representatives and what they had to say about our budget proposals and the record investment which is supporting jobs today and building the infrastructure that Australia needs for tomorrow. I note that the Leader of the National Party was speaking at a New South Wales Nationals conference in Wagga Wagga last Friday. He is also the shadow minister for transport and I thought he might have a bit to say at that conference. Members will recall the amendment moved to the Nation Building Program legislation, when the parliament sat a couple of weeks ago, that would stop funding of black spots in regional communities. Remember that amendment which the opposition moved so that you could not have black spot funding on the national network? They all went to the photo opportunities in their electorates applauding the funding, yet they had voted against it being permitted under the Nation Building Program. I thought the Leader of the National Party might have a bit to say about how the opposition are taking on the government over this outrageous measure that they say the government has put in. I had a look at the speech and there are 2,600 words in it but transport is not mentioned, not even once. There is not one word from the shadow minister about transport. There is nothing about nation building or about infrastructure. He had nothing at all to say. The Leader of the National Party was in Wagga Wagga at the conference and he would have known-and there would have been people from Wagga Wagga there, too, who would have known-that we are duplicating the Hume Highway by 2012, and that we are bringing forward record spending on the Hume Highway. I had a look at what was in the speech of the Leader of the National Party and he said a very interesting thing. He said: We are increasingly seen as the party of regional tomorrow. Australia, grounded in the regions and taking forward regional expertise and ideas for consideration in Canberra and Macquarie Street. That is an interesting perspective given that, when I was elected here in 1996 there were 18 Nationals in the parliament and now there are nine. Yet they argue that they are moving forward and are increasingly seen as the party of regional Australia. Mr Oakeshott interjectingMONICA",61
63,Mr ALBANESE,"I notice the member for Lyne having a good chuckle at the idea that the National Party are the party of regional Australia and that they are moving forward in Macquarie Street and in Canberra. The Leader of the National Party has become the Comical Ali of the Parliament. Remember Comical Ali as the US troops came into Baghdad? He said, ‘It's okay, nothing's happening. It's okay, we're going well.' Comical Ali had this to say about the Americans, ‘We have destroyed their shovels. We have driven them back.' Well, those opposite want to destroy the shovels of the government, those nation-building shovels that are being utilised throughout the country to build roads, to build rail and to build ports. Those opposite, in spite of their best efforts to stop the nation-building agenda of this government, will not succeed. I must say that the Leader of the National Party perhaps listened to the leader of the coalition who said, on 20 May when he was in Adelaide, about the government's nationbuilding agenda and I quote: … everything will have to be reviewed. There's no question about that. What we see is those opposite drawing into question the nation-building agenda that the government has. The government will not be deterred. It will continue to support programs which support jobs today and which build the infrastructure that Australia needs for Building the Education Revolution Program NA the Minister for Education. Does the minister agree with the Prime Minister's comments on 3 February about the school stimulus package when he said, ‘This government will adopt a zero tolerance approach to any state government, whatever its political complexion, to any substitution of effort,' and, if so, what action will the government take against the South Australian government, which cut funding by 12 per cent for capital works programs in schools in its 2009-10 budget?",62
64,The SPEAKER,I call the Deputy Prime Minister.,62
65,Ms GILLARD,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and once again, because we do not have accurate questions from the shadow minister for education, I will check what he has asserted, because we know from former question times that assertions made by the opposition about Building the Education Revolution and about the government's education policies generally turn out to be completely spurious when investigated. What I can say to the shadow ministerand he may or may not be interested because the degree of seriousness with which he takes his education work is always something to be doubted-is that the government is absolutely determined that the Building the Education Revolution program is an addition to investment that would have happened in any event as a result of state budgets. We work constantly with our state and territory colleagues to deliver that program. The sanctions that can be applied under the agreements that surround the Building the Education Revolution program are serious ones and they are understood by our state and territory colleagues. Can I reiterate: for a man who earlier in question time was yelling at me, ‘What about Gepps Cross school?' only to be humiliated when his claim was found to be ridiculousMs Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The question was specifically in relation to the cut of 12 per cent to the capital works program in the South Australian budget. I would ask the Deputy Prime Minister to answer what actionMONICA",62
66,The SPEAKER,Order! The Deputy Prime Minister is responding to the question.,63
67,Ms GILLARD,"I certainly will investigate the claims made. But, given the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has risen to her feet to once again indicate an interest in education, I will take the opportunity to remind House that, when she was minister for education, we did have a problem with funding going to schools that were closing. I remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition of the Investing in Our Schools Program grant she made to the Bowral Rudolf Steiner School in 2007, when it closed in 2007. There is the grant that she made to the Marist College Rosalie School in 2008, when it closed in 2008. Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, IMONICA",63
68,The SPEAKER,Order! The Deputy Prime Minister will resume her seat and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat. Ms Julie Bishop interjectingMONICA,63
69,The SPEAKER,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat! The Deputy Prime Minister will refer her remarks to the question before us.,63
70,Ms GILLARD,"As I understand the question before us, questions are being raised about the government's education programs. The simple point I was making is that some of these criticisms lie ill in the mouths of people whose administrationNA order. I am happy to repeat the question if the Deputy Prime Minister seems to have forgotten it. It was not a general question. It was about states skimming-12 per cent by the state government in South AustraliaMONICA",63
71,The SPEAKER,Order! There is no need to repeat the question. The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat.,63
72,Ms GILLARD,"Can I reiterate that, obviously, Building the Education Revolution is an economic stimulus package. It is to go on top of other expenditures. I will investigate the claims made, but I make this very simple point: for an opposition that opposed the this program lock, stock and barrel, under whose administration not one school would get one cent, it seems to me pretty interesting that they come in here day after day with claims that, when investigated, turn out to be fabricated. On the track record of the opposition when it was in government and the track record of those who held the education portfolio, let us just contemplate for a moment what, if any, lasting reforms people will be talking about from the Howard era. Can't think of one? Well, there would be a good reason for that. Solar Energy",63
73,Mr BEVIS ,"3.17 pm)-My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. How will the new solar credits continue the government's unprecedented support for the solar panel industry? How does this approach compare with previous approaches in delivering value for money in environmental and water programs?",64
74,Mr GARRETT,"I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. The fact is that there is more government support for the solar industry and there are more solar panels going onto Australian rooftops under the Rudd government than at any previous time. The pre-election commitment of $150 million for five years was to fund 15,000 solar rebates; we now have funded more than 80,000 solar rebates from the time we came to government. That exceeds our election commitment some fourfold. Over 60,000 installations are in the pipeline and that means that the industry has at least 12 months work, according to current rates, to continue putting solar panels on people's roofs. During the coalition's entire 12 years in office, the solar rebate program supported around 10,500 installations of solar panels. That is 10,000 panels over 12 years versus 80,000 in just 18 months. I am reminded of that song What a Difference a Day Makes. Some of you will know the melody. Opposition members interjectingMONICA",64
75,Mr GARRETT,"I will not sing it here, although I know you would like me to. What a difference a day makes not only for the Leader of the Opposition, given the announcement by the member for Higgins; what a difference 18 months makes in the term of a government. Now, with solar credits operating through the renewable energy target, there is long-term certainty for the solar industry to go and to grow and to invest beyond budget cycles. There will be an upfront capital cost subsidy to all households and no means test. Households, the local fish and chip shop, farmers, community groups, businesses and families are all in the market for solar credits. The member for Flinders, who I notice is absent today, said last week in relation to the Leader of the Opposition: Malcolm Turnbull was the guy who introduced the $8,000 rebate. He knew it was going to be successful. He wanted it to be successful and that is why he actually introduced it as an uncapped rebate. He said, ‘Look, if this is successful, that's a good problem we'll have to deal with not a bad problem.' I want to advise the House of the real story. When the now Leader of the Opposition did increase solar rebates in 2007, he said that he expected the program to be unpopular. I refer to the Daily Telegraph of 12 May 2007, which reported: Environment Minister Malcolm Turnbull doesn't need a state-wide survey showing him solar energy is unpopular. He already knows. The Saturday Daily Telegraph can reveal the reason the federal government didn't make its $150 million solar rebate any bigger was because there was not enough demand for solar panels. ‘If demand exceeds our expectations then obviously we'll review the scheme,' he said. ‘To date shortage of money has not been an issue. Solar panels are still pretty expensive.' So we have the member for Flinders saying that the opposition wrote a blank cheque for solar rebates because Mr Turnbull knew it was going to be successful. But, in 2007, the now Leader of the Opposition was backgrounding the Daily Telegraph and saying that his expectations would be that the rebate would be unpopular. This is an absolute sham. But we should not be surprised by the opposition. I was asked how this compares with previous approaches to deliver value-on environmental values, on programs, on water programs and the like. At the same time as very few solar panels were going onto the roofs of Australian homes under the coalition government when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for the environment, he had responsibility for water policy as well. What was that water policy? It was water policy dreamt up on the back of an envelope: a commitment to spend money, not a single delivery of water back into the Murray-Darling Basin system, with no consultation with Treasury, no consultation with the nowdeparting member for Higgins, no consultation with farmers organisations-in other words, just doing it on the run. It should not surprise us because, well fore the last election, we know that the Leader of the Opposition was focusing on another aspect of water policy. This was the advice that the Leader of the Opposition received from his department to spend some $2 million on investigating cloud-seeding technologies. There we were two days into the election campaign, with the substantial matters of policy to be determined, including what the government was then going to bring to the people by way of climate change policy and the like, and we had the member for Wentworth writing to the Prime Minister, saying, ‘Can we have $10 million to spend on the project?' I should point out that a year earlier the member for Wentworth, the now Leader of the Opposition, had written to a scientific expert telling him that cloud seeding simply did not work. He used the expression that the results were ‘inconclusive at best'. Here we had a reckless spending exercise, against the advice of the minister's department, whilst at the same time there were no policies for renewable energy, no policies for green jobs and no policies for increasing the capacity of the solar industry to do what it had to do. Now we have the opposition leader supporting, it is said, the government's targets on climate change, but with coalition members in his own party saying right out loud that they oppose the scheme. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: the confusion that is rampant within your ranks over climate change is an absolute disgrace-with business needing certainty, with green jobs ready to be put into place-and at this point in time we have an opposition leader who is opposed to the stimulus package and who opposed the energy efficient homes plan. This is a plan which will see an extraordinary number of homes-some three million Australian households-get ceiling insulation in their roofs, reducing the costs of beenergy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and producing jobs and green jobs at the same time. It is time that the opposition leader focused on the real policy initiatives, recognised the importance of providing certainty for the Australian public in dealing with climate change and looked at these significant issues and at the commitment that this government has to solar panels. National School Pride Program",64
76,Mr HAASE ,"3.23 pm)-My question is addressed to the Minister for Education. Will the minister explain why her National School Pride program prohibits schools from installing air conditioning in existing classrooms that have none and why, as a consequence, children in dozens of schools across my electorate of Kalgoorlie will continue to swelter or be sent home on all-too-frequent hot days?",65
77,Ms GILLARD,"I thank the member for his question, which I am very happy to answer. I suggest that perhaps he needs to have a discussion with his shadow minister, because what his shadow minister said in the last question is that he is concerned that state governments are not maintaining effort on education capital and equipment, whereas the member has raised a question with me which would seem to suggest the only source of funding available to schools for things air conditioning is Building the Education Revolution. Building the Education Revolution is for specific purposes. Amongst the specific purposes is the construction of new buildings and those buildings can be air conditioned. Of course, on general repairs for schools and the air conditioning of classrooms, that is something that state governments attend to for state schools. So he may want to raise his question with the state Liberal governmentNA",65
78,The SPEAKER,Order! The member for Sturt will leave the chamber for one hour under 94(a). The member for Sturt then left the chamber.,66
79,Ms GILLARD,"What the guidelines provide-and the guidelines are very clearis for newly constructed buildings under Primary Schools for the 21st Century as part of Building the Education Revolution. Of course, appropriate climate control, whether it be air conditioning or heating, can be installed. National School Pride program money can go to small-scale repairs and it is going to shadecloth and some of the other important things in schools. It is air conditioning; that is true. As the member would be aware, a substantial consideration with the insertion of air conditioning in schools is the ongoing costs of running the air conditioning. He would know, from the climate he comes from, that the capital cost of putting in the air conditioning is one thing; the year-on-year power cost is another. We have obviously said to state governments, as we have gone about this task, that our economic stimulus is extra to the things that they ordinarily do. One of the things they ordinarily do is work out how to renovate classrooms for climate control, including an understanding of what the ongoing like recurrent costs of that would be. We have said to state governments that, with major constructs under Primary Schools for the 21st Century, appropriate climate control will be part of the fit-out, as will the things required to make buildings functional, including in some cases interactive whiteboards and the like. Those things are all part of the program. I can understand that the member is disgruntled about the circumstances in his electorate for some of the children who attend school in his electorate. On the question of air conditioning for current school facilities, he should feel very free to direct that to the state minister for education in his state of Western Australia. Climate Change",66
80,Mr DANBY ,"3.27 pm)-My question is to the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change. Will the minister outline to the House the work that has been done over the last decade to set up an emissions trading scheme and implement an expanded renewable energy target? How has this work assisted the government to take real action on climate change and how is this not going to action being received?",66
81,Mr COMBET,"Thank you to the member for Melbourne Ports. As a former constituent of his, I can attest to the fact that he has a serious interest in the issue of climate change. We all have a responsibilityincluding the opposition-to the Australian people and to future generations to act on climate change. For the government's part, the government accepts the consensus view of scientists. Importantly, the Fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel that on Climate Change states that warming is unequivocal and human activities are responsible for most of the observed warming over the last 50 years. That is a consequence of the work of over 1,200 scientists from over 130 countries that has been subject to peer review, contained and represented in the Fourth assessment report of the IPCC. The government also accepts that if we fail to now we will cause irreparable damage to our environment, economy and way of life. The fact is that Australia is a hot and dry contiAct. nent and failure to act will have an adverse effect on our ecosystems and our economy, particularly on industries such as agriculture and tourism. Further delay in acting against climate change means the cost of adjustment will be greater and other countries will get ahead of us in creating the low-pollution jobs of the future. And that is why the government has established targets and developed the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme to go about achieving them. But in the face of all this evidence the coalition continue to ignore the challenge of climate change and insist on delay-even after 12 years in government characterised by inaction on this issue in face of numerous reports and commitments given during their period in government. Just to give an overview of some of the work and the advice that the coalition commissioned and ignored: in 1999 there were no fewer than six reports to the Howard government, all of which were ignored. The Australian Greenhouse Office discussion paper series on emissions trading was issued during that year and included a discussion paper on establishing the boundaries of a scheme, a discussion paper on issuing permits, a discussion paper on how crediting carbon pollution could occur, a discussion paper on designing the carbon-trading market, a discussion paper on the greenhouse challenge and a further report of the Greenhouse Energy Group on planning for mandatory targets for the uptake of renewable energy in power supplies, followed in the year 2000 by a further report of the Australian Greenhouse Office on encouraging early greenhouse abatement mechanisms. In 2002 there was a further report from the Greenhouse Office on greenhouse gas emisact sions. In 2003 there was a report on renewable opportunities and a review of the operation of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) In 2007, of course, there was the Shergold report, from the Prime Minister's task group at that time, on emissions trading, which led to the Howard government indicating that it would commit to an emissions trading scheme. But in the face of all that, nothing was done. The advice was ignored. The reports were shelved. During 2008, by contrast, the Rudd government received the Garnaut Climate Change Review report. A green paper on the development of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme was developed. A white paper was issued in December 2008 and there were numerous industry consultations. In 2009, the draft CPRS legislation was released, nuthe merous Senate inquiries have been held and now the draft Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill has been released. On that point, the government intends implementing its policy by virtue of that legislation to achieve 20 per cent of Australia's electricity supply being delivered by renewable sources by the year 2020. That is expected to drive $19 billion worth of investment in renewable energy activity. These are great institutional changes. They are extremely important and in the face of them the coalition has abrogated its responsibility to support them. However, Mr Turnbull, the Leader of the Opposition, has indicated what is the coalition's policy. He made this remark on 9 July 2008: … the Howard Government's policy last year was that we would establish an emissions trading tem not later than 2012. And importantly, in the light of the excuses for delay that have been articulated by the Liberal Party in recent times, Mr Turnbull, the Leader of the Opposition, said: It was not conditional on international action … Commitment to an emissions trading system was to be pursued by the coalition. More recently, the Leader of the Opposition has confirmed that there will be an emissions trading scheme in this country. The trouble is that the coalition and the Leader of the Opposition cannot deliver on these issues and all we have heard are excuses for delay. The reason that there are excuses for delay is that the opposition is deeply divided. And you do not have to take my point of view on it; there is plenty of evidence from members of the opposition. Take this quote from Senator Eric Abetz: There is no doubt that weedsThat was ‘weeds'pose … a challenge much clearer, more present and possibly more serious than the unclear challenge which climate change may or may not pose to our biodiversity … And there are many other instances where members of the opposition have indicated a completely contrary view to that of the Leader of the Opposition on the issue of emissions trading and scepticism about the science. And that is the reason for the division on that side of politics and the reason that all they posit are excuses for delay. The government has brought forward the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. It has passed through this House. We will be bringing forward legislation to establish a fourfold increase in the renewable energy target. We have established ambitious carbon pollution reduction targets, we have signed the Kyoto Protocol and we will take action. It is time that the opposition exercised responsibility sys- on behalf of the Australian community on this question.

86,Mr KATTER ,"3.37 pm)-My question without notice is to the honourable Minister for Resources and Energy. The minister would be aware of his own role as the Lone Ranger riding to the rescue of the $15 billion North West Queensland Mineral Province about to be scalped by electricity demand growth outstripping supply in 2012, the current cost of inefficient small power generation rendering our mineral production noncompetitive, no growth capacity in the north-west grid and CPR charges. In light of this, could the minister ensureOpposition members interjectingMONICA",68
87,Mr KATTER,"It is a bit important, you know. It really is a little bit important.",68
88,The SPEAKER,Order! The member for Kennedy has the call. I am trying to hear him.,69
89,Mr KATTER,"I was wondering whether I did, Mr Speaker. In light of this could the minister ensure that (a) he arrives in time, he brings sufficient electricity with him and (c) his proposed clean energy corridor, for which his grid connection has provided the catalyst, will provide the silver bullet for Xstrata, BHP, Rio Tinto and Gutnick's Legend Mining with some 15,000 permanent jobs flowing from the Pentland biofuels project and the proposed mineral expansions? Finally, if not, would he not agree that even Tonto might decide that he and the infrastructure minister, Albanese, are palefaces?",69
90,The SPEAKER,"Just for the record, the last part of the question is out of order.",69
91,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,"I do not know where the Lone Ranger and Tonto are today, but I can assure the House they long gave up trying to corral the member for Kennedy. More seriously, this question is a very serious question. It goes to the potential development of the North West Mineral Province in Queensland. This province has long been held back by the lack of an adequate supply of energy at a reasonable cost. The member for Kennedy has raised the question of the possible development of the North West Mineral Province in the context of a key part of the government's recent budget strategy going to the establishment of a real government commitment to clean energy in Australia. I welcome his support for that government initiative, because it goes to our requirement to invest in not only carbon capture and storage but also renewable energy in Australia. That is because we are not interested in trying to pick winners; we are about trying to create a framework that encourages investment in all sources of potential energy in Australia. That takes me, firstly, to the question of carbon capture and storage and a commitment of $2.4 billion to cleaning up coal in Australia, reducing emissions. CCS is vital to our future, because 82 per cent of Austra(b) lia's electricity comes from coal-fired power stations. I was pleased to see carbon capture and storage in a commercial operation, the Sleipner petroleum field, when I recently visited Norway. CCS is currently in place throughout the world and it is our responsibility, not only as a coal-dependent energy nation but also as a major coal exporter, to actually get this technology right. I would also say that, if we achieve later this year the Gorgon gas investment of $30 billion to $50 billion, something that the Prime Minister and I are working on at the moment, you will see the largest carbon capture and storage operation in the world here, on Barrow Island in Western Australia. The member has also raised the need to focus on renewables. We are about investing real money-the biggest investment by an Australian government-in the renewables sector in Australia. That builds on our determination to put in place a measured carbon pollution reduction scheme with a renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020. Our demonstration program of $1.6 billion in solar technologies is not just about solar PV; it is also about seriously investigating whether or not solar thermal could supply real, baseload, secure energy in Australiaimportant not only to Australia but also to the global community. Not content with just focusing on carbon capture and storage and solar, we are also going to encourage the exploration and development of other demonstration activities, such as geothermal and wave power. This is about us ensuring as a nation that, when it comes to the issue of energy security, as we move to a low-emission economy, we not only guarantee our own future but also put in place technology options of great interest and need to the global community at large. So I say to the member for Kennedy: I express my appreciation for your support of the government's clean energy strategy. I am not the Lone Ranger; I have a huge posse behind me and absolute support of our clean energy demonstration program. Perhaps more importantly, he, like me, understands and appreciates that without a commitment to clean energy we will never have a capacity to develop the North West Mineral Province, which has the potential to be as important as north-west Western Australia. I thank him for his question. Swine Influenza",69
92,Mr SYMON ,3.43 pm)-My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Will the minister advise the House on the latest swine flu developments in Australia and internationally and on the government's response to date?,70
93,Ms ROXON,"I thank the member for Deakin for his question. Obviously amongst Victorian members there is a particular interest, but it is a matter of importance for the whole country. Members of the House may be aware that last Friday the World Health Organisation declared the H1N1 influenza strain a pandemic, the first global pandemic for 40 years. The World Health Organisation's phase 6 is characterised by community level outbreaks in at least one country in a different World Health Organisation region from the source country-in this case, Mexico. It indicates that there is sustained human-to-human community level transmission. The WHO's decision to declare the first pandemic of the 21st century indicates that it is no longer possible to contain the virus in particular geographical area. There are now nearly 30,000 cases of human swine influenza around the world, with 74 countries affected. The World Health Organisation considers that this pandemic, at least in its early stages, will be of moderate severity. Around the world, and as we are seeing here in Australia, the overwhelming majority of patients experience mild symptoms and will make a rapid and full recovery. This of course is an important factor to be weighed in the public health advice that is being provided to the community. However, as we also know, the disease has a hard edge with potentially severe complications for people with underlying health conditions such as morbid obesity, respiratory conditions and chronic disease and, like the regular flu, for pregnant women. Increasingly the world's focus, like our focus, is moving to identifying and treating those most at risk of severe complications. I do need to report to the House that we have heard the first reports in the media, as yet unconfirmed, of the first death in the United Kingdom, which would be the first death outside the Americas, underscoring the point that this disease can have severe consequences, although it is expected to be mild to moderate in most. Australia has about six per cent of the world's confirmed cases. Here in Australia as at 12 noon today there were 1,762 confirmed cases-1,210 in Victoria, 191 in New South Wales, 116 in Queensland, 63 in South Australia, 66 in Western Australia, 32 in Tasmania, 53 in the ACT and 31 in the Northern Territory. There are 10 people currently in hospital, three of whom are in intensive care. The hospitalised have generally been those people with existing conditions or complications such as morbid obesity and respiratory conditions. A number of schools and childcare centres are closed around the country, a particularly in those states other than Victoria that are still in the ‘contain' phase. Australia's current approach to swine flu is consistent with the World Health Organisation's recommendation that countries should now focus on treating those who are ill, providing guidance to people to protect themselves, closely monitoring the disease and adjusting the response to local conditions. This is what is already occurring in Australia and underpins the government's public health advice to the community. In particular, this is consistent with what is occurring in Victoria, with that state on a modified ‘sustain' alert level. I need to advise the House that we continue to give ongoing consideration to the appropriateness of Australia's national alert level. The rest of the try remains at ‘contain', where efforts are continuing with a focus on slowing the spread of the disease, which is why we are still seeing school closures in states other than Victoria. Of course, this is something that will continue to be reviewed day by day and hour by hour on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer as well as the Australian Health Protection Committee and the National Pandemic Emergency Committee. I do need to flag that, as the number of cases in Australia steadily increases, the government, in conjunction with the states and territories, will give further consideration to moving to a consistent alert level across Australia and to modifying our response to take account of the increasing number of cases in our community and the moderate severity to date. In particular, we will continue to carefully monitor the extent of community transmission-that is, cases with no known contact with other confirmed cases. From the data over the weekend the majority of cases outside Victoria can still be traced back to known contacts with other confirmed cases. But this is changing, and we will continue to monitor it closely over the coming days. I take this opportunity to remind Australians that the World Health Organisation and the government do not recommend the closure of any borders or travel restrictions during the pandemic. But the community must be aware that Australians travelling abroad are required to adhere not only to the laws of other countries but also to their health and quarantine arrangements. The Smartraveller website provides advice to this effect for those who are considering travel overseas. Although Australians are being encouraged to continue to undertake normal day-today activities, I know this is going to be difficult for some people, particularly as the consequences of voluntary exclusion from school and school closures have an impact counon family life. These school measures are being maintained in states in the ‘contain' phase as an agreed, effective way to slow the spread of the disease in the community. I want to take the opportunity to again thank the public, and parents in particular, for their forbearance in this difficult period, which we know can cause family inconvenience. I would also like to take the opportunity to again thank doctors and other health officials for their ongoing efforts and attention in a pandemic which is going to continue to add a significant burden to their already demanding roles. Nation Building and Jobs Plan",70
94,Mr BRIGGS ,"3.49 pm)-My question is to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer explain why a $900 cash-splash cheque from the Reserve Bank to Mrs Gloria Hartridge has bounced, resulting in a $9 dishonour fee to this hard working mother? Treasurer, has the government run out of money? Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order under the standing orders. Have they run out of questions?",71
95,The SPEAKER,"Order! There is no point of order. There have been a number of questions that, on literal interpretation of the standing orders, have been outside the standing orders.",71
96,Mr SWAN,"I am happy to look at the details, as usual. Whether what the member says is true or not, I do not know, but I am happy toMs Julie Bishop interjectingMONICA",72
97,Mr SWAN,"Well, that would be a change, wouldn't it! That would be a dramatic change from what we have been seeing in the House over a long period of time. This crew opposite will go to enormous lengths to try and discredit the importance of economic stimulus and what it has done to support employment and business in the Australian economy. They will go to any lengths-they will say anything, they will do anything and they will distort anything-to try and cast some doubt on the effectiveness of economic stimulus, which has been of such benefit to so many people in this community who have been employed and so many businesses out there who really need customers coming through the door. But they simply do not get it. I am happy to follow up the details, but it does not in any way absolve any of those opposite from their irresponsibility in voting against what has been absolutely critical for the Australian economy in our time of need. FIFA World Cup Bid",72
98,Mr CRAIG THOMSON ,"3.51 pm)-My question is to the Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth and Minister for Sport. Will the minister update the House on Australia's bid for the 2018-22 FIFA World Cup?",72
99,Ms KATE ELLIS,"I thank the member for his question and I would of course be delighted to update the House on the exciting developments with the official launch of the World Cup bid yesterday. Before doing that I would like to take the opportunity to place on the parliamentary record the Australian government's congratulations to Football Federation Australia, to Pim Verbeek, to captain Lucas Neill and of course to the phenomenal Socceroos on their recent historic qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. I know that the whole parliament will join in adding their congratulations. This achievement should not be underestimated. It is after all only the third time that Australia has qualified to compete with the best of the best on the world stage in this sport. But it is also the first time that we have been able to go back-to-back, and the manner in which we did it was without conceding a single goal and we qualified with two games remaining, all of which make it a truly remarkable achievement. The Socceroos have shown that Australia has become a major player on the world stage when it comes to football. This was also demonstrated yesterday with the official launch of our FIFA World Cup bid. I know that the official launch of our bid was attended by members from both sides of the House and quite literally brought football into the parliament. When the bid was launched by the Prime Minister yesterday, the message that Australia sent to the world was clear: Australia is ready and we want the world to come and play on our home turf. I would like to particularly note the contribution that the Leader of the Opposition made yesterday when he stated that the bid had ‘the unequivocal support' of both sides of the House and that the opposition and the government will be ‘side by side, joined at the hip, as dual strikers' to bring the World Cup to Australia. I think it is important that we note that, on these major international ventures, this parliament does work together very productively because we know that bipartisanship is crucial to the success of the prized goal. We also know that, beyond politics, the involvement and the inclusion of the community is crucial. We need to show the whole world that as a community we are united behind this bid, and the community will be included with a strong role to play tle going forward. Chairman Frank Lowy announced yesterday that we want the community to play their role as thousands of individual ambassadors. Already, one Facebook site that is dedicated to supporting Australia's bid to host the 2018-22 World Cup now has over 80,000 people registered as members. In fact, just prior to received an email from the Subiaco Junior Soccer Club under-15s, who were offering to beMs Julie Bishop-A wonderful team.",72
100,Ms KATE ELLIS,"I am sure they are a wonderful team. In fact they are travelling overseas to compete in Sweden later this year. They have offered to act as ambassadors for Australia's bid on the world stage. This is an offer that we will certainly take them up on. I would like to call on all Australians to get involved and log onto the newly launched website, www.australia20182022.com.au, to register their support for our bid and to get behind the campaign to show to the entire world that there is no better place on the planet to hold the World Cup than right here in Australia, because there is no doubt that there is a lot of hard work that lies before us from this point on. We also know that there are significant benefits in terms of infrastructure and job creation and of course massive benefits in terms of tourism potential. So we as a government will continue to work very hard to support Frank Lowy, Ben Buckley and Football Federation Australia. We will work on a coordinated approach across government but we will also be working in very strong partnership with all of the states and territories, which have signed up to supporting the bid through COAG. Australia will be making its first presentation before FIFA later this year, in December, before submitting the formal bid in May of next year, with a decision bein the bating made in December next year. We know that the competition is very tight but we also know that when it comes to hosting major sporting events there is nobody in the world that does it better than Australia. Together we will work on a united and inclusive bid to show to the whole world that Australia will put on the best World Cup the question time. I world has ever seen. Mr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS Building the Education Revolution Program",73
101,Ms GILLARD ,"Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (3.57 pm)- Mr Speaker, I seek the indulgence of the chair to add to an answer.",73
102,The SPEAKER,The minister may proceed.,73
103,Ms GILLARD,"I seek to add to an answer asked of me by the shadow minister for education, when he was in the parliament earlier, which related to the Hastings Public School. The assertion in the member's question was that somehow the cost for a covered outdoor learning area had increased tenfold in just six years. Can I clarify the matter as follows: the Hastings Public School in New South Wales has certainly received $400,000 for the construction of a covered outdoor learning area. This is a significant building with a solid roof. It also includes an amphitheatre, seating and a sound system to facilitate school assemblies and performances and science and art work spaces. I do not know whether the member was seeking to assert that in 2003 the Hastings Public School had received $40,000 for some shadecloth. I do not have a record of that. What I think is quite likely to have happened is that the shadow minister has become confused between the Hastings Public School in New South Wales and Hastings Primary School in Victoria. If he has become confused on that basis let me take the opportunity to explain to him that they are two different schools in two different states. The Hastings Public School in New South Wales, which is so ably represented in this parliament by the member for Lyne, also received funding of $2.6 million for new classroom construction. I understand from him that he is very well aware of the views of the school. They are delighted with the funding for the covered outdoor learning area. The principal has also informed me that he is a semifinalist in The Einstein Factor, with the topic of Franklin RooseveltOpposition members interjectingMONICA",73
104,Ms GILLARD,"I know that wishing a principal well is just too much for the opposition to do; it is too hard! Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. This is going far beyond just the indulgence of adding to an answer to a question. The Deputy Prime Minister is getting on to areas that are totally irrelevant to any question asked of her in question time and she should be sat down.",74
105,The SPEAKER,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat. The Deputy Prime Minister is adding to an answer.,74
106,Ms GILLARD,"I know that it is beyond the charity of heart of the opposition to wish a school principal well in The Einstein Factor, but I most certainly do, and I am sure that members of the government and the Independents do, including the local member opposite. I am sure that, in studying Franklin Roosevelt for The Einstein Factor competition, the principal's grasp on economics is now far clearer than that of the Liberal opposition and what it has got to offer.

117,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,"NA However, it is untrue that his private blog was linked to a pornographic site. The site referred to in the article is called AwkwardFamilyPhotos and it is currently linked to many public sites, including, would you believe it, the Daily Telegraph site.

DOCUMENTS",75
119,Mr ALBANESE ,Grayndler-Leader of the House) (4.03 pm)-Documents are presented as listed in the schedule circulated to honourable members. Details of the documents will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings. MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS Piracy and Armed Robbery at Sea,75
120,Mr ALBANESE ,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (4.03 pm)-by leave-On 12 June 2009 in a joint media release with the foreign minister, the Hon. Stephen Smith MP, I announced that Australia has strengthened its commitment to international efforts to combat piracy off the Horn of Africa. Australia will provide $500,000, as well as skills and expertise, to the joint European Commission/United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Counter Piracy Program to assist Kenyan authorities in receiving and processing apprehended piracy suspects. Australia will provide an official through the Office of the Inspector of Transport Security and the Australian Federal Police to work with the UNODC in the Nairobi office in Kenya in dealing with piracy in the region. The international community, and particularly the UNODC, recognises that, if an effective deterrent is to be created in the prosecution of suspected pirates, there needs to be a capacity for the legal processing to occur within the north-east African region. The official will work with local authorities in Kenya in dealing with apprehended piracy This is one of a range of measures undertaken by the Australian government to comAtbat the growing international problem of piracy. International Maritime Bureau figures show that more than 100 ships were attacked and 42 hijacked in the Gulf of Aden and the Somalia region in 2008. There have been around 60 attacks and 25 successful hijackings this year. Piracy is an issue that impacts on the entire international community, as the attack on the Italian cruise ship MSC Melody in April demonstrated. With over 1,500 passengers and crew, including 74 Australians, the Melody was attacked by pirates in a speedboat at least 600 miles from the Somali coast-a practical demonstration that this issue is a global one that affects every country. The threat of piracy needs to be taken seriously, especially by countries such as Australia, which relies almost exclusively on international shipping for our exports and imports. With 99 percent of our exports by volume being transported by sea, a safe and secure maritime industry is paramount-to our economy, to our maritime industry and to the safety of many Australians who travel through international waters each year. In May this year, the government announced that Australia would contribute Australian Defence Force resources to international anti-piracy efforts off the Horn of rica. Our contribution includes the tasking of our Navy ANZAC-class frigate and RAAF AP3C Orion patrol aircraft, which are already contributing to counterterrorism activities in the region. Flexible employment of our assets across several coalition task forces locations. allows the ADF to contribute in an agile way to the highest priority activity. It is broadly recognised that the best long-term solution to the problem of piracy is to restore peace and stability in the Horn of Africa. At the international conference on Somalia in Brussels on 22-23 April this year, the government committed $2 million in security and humanitarian assistance to support international efforts to restore peace to Somalia. The United Nations estimates that over half the population of Somalia is in need of humanitarian assistance and that one in six Somali children under five is acutely malnourished. Australia will contribute $1.5 million to the United Nations Humanitarian Appeal, which will go towards security protection for humanitarian workers in Somalia to support vital health services for women and children, and $500,000 to the African Union Mission in Somalia, which is aiming to help Somalia's transitional government stabilise the country through strengthening financial systems and further medical assistance. Since 2005-06, the Australian government has contributed $9 million of humanitarian assistance to Somalia and assistance has also been provided to neighbouring countries dealing with Somalian refugees. In December 2008, the Office of Transport Security issued Maritime Security Notice (2/08) on ‘Security Regulated Australian Ships: Protective security arrangements for transiting through high-risk shipping lanes' to Australian shipowners in response to the increase in acts of piracy and armed robbery Af- in shipping lanes and waters surrounding the Gulf of Aden and the Somalian coast. The notice emphasised the importance for regulated Australian ships to apply robust and layered protective security measures when transiting through shipping lanes in high-risk The Australian Maritime Safety Authority Marine Notice (10/2009) on ‘Piracy and armed robbery against ships in the Somali Basin and the Western Indian Ocean' of June 2009 advises the Australian shipping industry to implement International Maritime Organisation preventative measures to deter and suppress acts of piracy and armed robbery against ships. In February 2009, I asked the Inspector of Transport Security, Mr Mick Palmer, a former head of the Australian Federal Police, to undertake a comprehensive inquiry into maritime piracy and armed robbery at sea as NA ing the impact of piracy and armed robbery at sea on Australian registered and international trading ships and on Australian maritime trade more generally. The Australian government want to make sure that we have an appropriate security framework to deal with these threats. As part of the inquiry process, the inspector and key members of his team have liaised with a range of senior stakeholders, including the UNODC, Interpol, the International Maritime Organisation, the International Maritime Bureau, as well as military, industry and diplomatic stakeholders, to ensure that his inquiry complements wider international efforts. It was a result of the conduct of his inquiry that the opportunity for Australia to make a contribution to the UNODC Counter Piracy Program came to light. The inquiry will assist the Australian government in determining whether any changes are required to our domestic security framework. Mr Palmer is due to report in the second half of 2009. Within our own region, the Malacca strait has for many years been a focus for pirate and criminal activities. This narrow strait contains thousands of islets, and is an outlet for many rivers, making it an ideal location for pirates to hide and evade capture. It is an important passageway between China and India and is on the route between Europe, the Suez Canal, the Persian Gulf and the busy ports of Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Pusan and Tokyo. Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand have formed the Malacca Straits Security Joint Working Group in response to the problem. This issue was discussed at the APEC meeting of transport ministers that I attended in Manila, the Philippines, two months ago. Under the initiative, the maritime forces of the four countries coordinate sea patrols of the area. Overall, there has been a significant reduction in attacks in this important maritime area. In conclusion, the Palmer inquiry, the ADF commitment to anti-piracy efforts and the contribution of financial support and skills and expertise to the UNODC demonstrate Australia's commitment to work with effective international forums such as the International Maritime Organisation and the United Nations to deal with the threat of international piracy off the Horn of Africa. I met with the head of the International Maritime Organisation, Admiral Mitropoulos, at the IMO headquarters in London on 1 April this year. At that meeting, he made a request for Australia's direct participation in these activities. I am pleased that the government have been able to deliver in these small but important measures to make sure that, once again, we are taking our place as good international citizens when it comes to international maritime issues. I want to acknowledge the presence in the parliament today of the Minister for Foreign Affairs for Kenya, Moses Wetang'ula, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the Republic of Rwanda, Mrs Rosemary Museminali. Both of these ministers have expressed their support and gratitude for Australia making this commitment. This threat of piracy directly affects the lives of Australians travelling through this region and our economic interests that are reliant on the safety and security of international shipping. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the Leader of the Nationals to speak for 10 minutes. Leave granted.",75
121,Mr ALBANESE,I move: That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Truss (Leader of the Nationals) speaking in reply to the ministerial statement for a period not exceeding 10 minutes. Question agreed to.,77
122,Mr TRUSS ,"Wide Bay-Leader of the Nationals) (4.07 pm)-This ministerial statement from the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government is fundamentally just a repeat of a press release made on 12 June. The minister's leaving the chamber demonstrates that he is also not too interested in any kind of response to his statement and is, therefore, taking a further step in devaluing the importance of ministerial statements to the chamber. This statement is about a grant of $500,000. Many important things happen in the parliament and many important things happen in our country, and it is appropriate that there be ministerial statements to deal with these issues; but, when the minister does not even think it is necessary to remain in the chamber to listen to the reply to his statement, it is quite clear that he does not give this matter very high priority. That is disappointing because the issue of piracy on the high seas is an important issue. Whether this government's contribution will make a significant difference to the level of piracy around the world remains to be seen, but the issue of piracy itself is an important one and deserving of parliamentary debating time. It is a dangerous threat to global maritime security. It threatens the livelihood of ship-borne commerce, which is the backbone of world trade. The overwhelming majority, by volume, of Australia's trade is carried by ships and, therefore, it is important to us as nation that shipping trade be safe and secure. The risk of piracy means that ships are sometimes forced to take longer routes around dangerous zones and it certainly slows down the delivery and reliability of delivery of sea carried goods. The activities of pirates in the Gulf of Aden are of considerable concern threatening, as they do, Australia's merchant trade and threatening Australian sailors and tourists passing through the gulf and the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal is, of course, an important funnel for international trade. A very large proportion of maritime traffic moves through that canal and therefore ships moving up the Gulf of Aden are particularly vulnerable to attack from pirates. It is perhaps a commentary on the audacity of some of the piracy activity that is occurring at the present time that it is happening under the nose of a considerable naval presence and despite the fact that the presence of these pirates from Somalia is well known to the maritime community. The very presence of these pirates, particularly those coming from some of the countries in Africa where there is an acute shortage of food and other supplies, is a particular irony because the pirate activities threaten the delivery of food and aid to some of the poorest countries in Africa. This was illustrated with the seizure of the Maersk Alabama in April this year. That ship was carrying 5,000 metric tonnes of relief supplies for Somalia, Kenya and Uganda. Those who felt that intercepting this trade was in some way acceptable behaviour were not thinking of the impact on their fellow citizens in Somalia and other impoverished people in Kenya and Uganda. I understand that Somali pirates received over US$150 million in ransom in the 12 months prior to November 2008. Pirates operating from Somalia have attacked more than 100 vessels in waters off the African a coast in the past year, including cruise liners, a fully laden supertanker and a ship laden with Russian tanks. As the minister pointed out, much is already being done by the international community to address this scourge. According to public reports, the European Union has a task force of six warships and three surveillance aircraft from eight countries patrolling one million square kilometres of the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden. The United States is making a contribution with its Fifth Fleet based in Bahrain. India, Russia, Malaysia and others are also providing warships. Australia, too, is making its contribution. The recent successful assistance provided by HMAS Sydney and HMAS Ballarat in protecting MV Dubai Princess south of Yemen from an attack by pirates is an example. The deployment of the ANZAC frigate with the assistance of the RAAF AP3C Orion maritime aircraft is a welcome contribution to this international effort. This effort will have to continue, as the success of the international task force is driving the activities of the pirates further south, increasing the threat to sea lanes and expanding the area of ocean that will need to be patrolled. A policy of effective interdiction provided by a substantial and robust international naval presence in the waters east of Africa is essential part of the strategy to deal with threat of Somalia based piracy. This is a plus. It will require a concerted effort to rebuild the shattered national institutions of Somalia if there is to be a long-term solution. Unfortunately, this hastily cobbled together effort from the government in dealing with this complex problem raises more questions than it answers. The ministerial statement provides very little additional information on what this money is going to be spent on, where it is coming from and what the objectives of this assistance actually are. We are told it is going to provide $500,000, as well as skills and expertise, to the joint European Commission and United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime Counter Piracy Program to assist Kenyan authorities in receiving and apprehending piracy suspects. Australia is to provide an official through the Office of the Inspector of Transport Security and the Australian Federal Police to work with the UNODC in the Nairobi office in Kenya dealing with piracy in the region. We are not provided with any information as to how this money is going to be spent beyond that it is going to provide some kind of judicial support for Kenyan authorities. The minister has not explained how this money will reduce the threat of piracy. Likewise, we do not know what the Australian government official will do. The government has not even made it clear where the official will come from, whether from the Office of the Inspector of Transport Security or from the Australian Federal Police. The details are not there. Frankly, this statement has all the hallmarks of another piece of spin supporting the Prime Minister's ego driven bid for a temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council. We have seen far too much of this extraordinary focus of the Prime Minister on securing this particular seat, a campaign that is consuming the resources of the Departan ment of Foreign Affairs and Trade and disthe tracting the government from its requirement to advance and protect the interest of Australians overseas. It is not even clear from the minister's statement whether the funding for this announcement is going to come from his own department, the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, or the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which of course had some significant increases in its budget in the appropriations currently before the parliament. I would be concerned, in light of all the cutbacks that have occurred in the department of regional development under the auspices of the current minister, if in fact grants were now going to be provided to Kenya to deal with Somali pirates, rather than to provide assistance to Australian regional communities for which this minister and this department should take primary responsibility. It would be a disappointment, at this time when he is cutting back road funding and other expenditure for the regions, if in fact funding were going to be provided towards an anti-piracy program in Somalia. That does not mean that we should not be involved in seeking to combat piracy in Somalia. But, clearly, the funding provided should come from the foreign aid budget or under the activities of Defence, who can play a useful role in helping to protect shipping, Australian and international, in that area. Also, the minister made some reference to the working group on piracy in the Malacca straits, a very worthwhile initiative initiated and undertaken during the term of the previous government. I am pleased that the current minister is continuing to ensure that Australia devotes resources to and takes a keen interest in its activities. That area is a particularly important waterway for Australian shipping. A very large proportion of our trade passes through the straits and in dealing with piracy issues we should be concentrating, as a priority, on ensuring that they remain safe.

123,Mrs HULL ,"Riverina) (4.24 pm)-In continuing my speech on the Health Insurance Amendment (Extended Medicare Safety Net) Bill 2009, I would like to bring to the attention of the House many of the issues that come under this bill and the areas that will be capped. Not all of these issues concern areas where I believe people are genuinely putting themselves in a position whereby they are overextending doctors or themselves as to medical issues or are perhaps overextending themselves and they do not require these services. I will look at the issues in respect of people who have assisted reproductive technology, or ART. In my electoral area covering Wagga Wagga and the Riverina, there was an assisted reproductive technology service in Wagga Wagga that took place in the Wagga day surgery. Our regional area people came in there to assist with the IVF and many other assisted reproductive skills that were provided by a specialist, who set up in Wagga particularly because the day theatre and the day surgery were there. That enabled her to come in and do obstetrics and also practise her passion for assisted reproductive technology, to benefit many couples who were childless and were assisted by IVF and other procedures. What happened was that when Calvary Hospital, a Catholic-run hospital, took over, having bought out the surgery, the theatres and the day hospital, it no longer allowed that type of activity to take place so now all of those in my region have to travel significant distances in order to access assisted reproductive technology, IVF and other assistance to be able to have children. The travel cost to them is absolutely astronomical. Generally, many city people can walk to or get a bus, a train or a ferry or some other form of public transport to a hospital system or to these kinds of facilities and not be personally out of pocket-after paying for bus fares, train fares and other public transport faresto the degree that my constituents are. When one has got to travel significant distances, you are constantly out of pocket. You might have to stay overnight or to stay two or three nights in order to access these services. If you are staying in a motel it could be extremely expensive. I think that there is a need to recognise the distance factor and the cost factor for many of those people in rural and regional Australia-and, in my case, in the electorate of Riverina-who simply have to incur costs those just to physically get themselves to these services let alone use them. So I am very concerned that this does not cover all assisted reproductive technology services. I think that is simply unfair and quite discriminatory, because it does not recognise how much money, including out-of-pocket expenses, regional mums wishing to be mums and families wishing to be families have to spend in trying to access these in the first place. I cannot understand the reasons behind all obstetric services not being covered. I understand that it has been reported that, between 2003 and 2008, the fees charged by obstetricians for in-hospital services reduced by six per cent while the fees charged for out-ofhospital services increased by a quite significant percentage. But I do wonder about people in those areas where you cannot get into a hospital. In particular, I am talking about the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital, which is a referral centre for all of our region and beyond. It is just so difficult to get into hospital to obtain any of these services. It is simply not possible to access the hospital service for these services. So do you not have the service at all or do you try to seek it as an outof-hospital service? Again, I wonder what considerations have been factored in. I wonder where this is actually coming from. If the specialist has come from a city area or an area that has easy access to hospital services et cetera and those services are not being utilised, then maybe I can understand it, but I do wonder, when we are all lumped into one big melting pot and considered as an aggregate or an average, how in such cases we can play a significant part in explaining the issues to rural and regional people. I also wonder how much effect this legislation will have in pushing more and more people into the public hospital system where already you cannot access any of those services in rural and regional areas. The one area that concerns me the mostand I spoke about this in the three minutes I had to speak on this bill before question time was called on-is cataract surgery. Only one type of cataract surgery is covered under this bill-and for it to be capped is in itself an issue. It is primarily one of those out-ofhospital services in a day surgery. It may be run on a fly-in fly-out basis or by a person that comes in when there is no ophthalmologist available in the regional areas. It might be somewhere out in the Broken Hill area, somewhere up the back of Bourke or somewhere else. Somebody comes in and does a significant caseload because there is no way to get access to an ophthalmologist unless these people come in. Of course it is going to start to blow out when you have people coming into do significant surgery. I am not saying that there is nobody who will rob or try to rort the safety net system. Anywhere, in anything you do, there will always be somebody who will do something that they should not be doing. I am not saying at all that that does not happen. I would hate to think that people would think that I was so naive as to think that there is not somewhere some abuse taking place of the safety net. But this bill is using a steelcapped boot to squash an ant. The fact is that some people might be abusing the system to some small degree but, on the other hand, people in rural and regional Australia are affected in the most significant ways. In the most significant ways they will be the ones that will be affected. Will ophthalmologists think it worth their while to take a day or two or three off work-generally a day and a half or more to travel to many of the outposts in Australia; it could be two days of travel each way-and then a day while they are there to undertake that day surgery? With a significant cap, will these specialist service providers consider that it is worthwhile for them to take all of this time out of their practice in order to go and run these day surgeries? It concerns me greatly. Coupled with this legislation, I understand that there will be further legislation coming into this House on cataract surgery itself. We have not seen this legislation yet, but I am led to believe, from a good source, that further legislation will be coming into the House severely cutting ophthalmology and cataract surgery. I cannot understand it. I am going to read from an email that I have received from one ophthalmologist in my electorate. Ophthalmologists are few and far between, let me tell you, and are very hard to come by. It is very hard to attract an ophthalmologist out into country Australia as it is. With this cap, and with the measures soon to be introduced into the House, it is going to be nigh on impossible for there to be ophthalmology services for rural and regional people, let alone for those people who live out in the wider expanses of Central Australia, in Broken Hill and other places. This ophthalmologist says that he is writing to make me aware that the government is intending to cut the rebate for cataract surgery by 50 per cent. He is not talking about this Medicare safety net but, coupled with the Medicare safety net, it is a big hit. He says: Their justification for doing this apparently is because they believe it is too quick and easy to perform and basically, not worth the money. Let me tell you, those people who had cataracts and had to have cataract surgery and are now free of cataracts think it is worth the money. If you lived like that you would soon find out whether it was worth the money. He goes on: Having taken four years of specific eye surgical training to master the procedure on top of a medical degree and 3-6 years of hospital residency coupled to the fact that community expectations are for 100% success rates and the stress associated with the procedure is somewhat akin to defusing a bomb through a microscope, we would beg to differ. One wonders if the Prime MinisterKevin Rudd orthe ministerMs Roxon to have their cataract done, whether they will trot down to the local public hospital to sign up to have the junior eye registrar do the procedure or whether they'll seek out the most competent and experienced surgeon in town. He goes on to say: The schedule fee for cataract surgery was around $800 in the early 1980s. The Government halved it back then and again cut it by around 30% in 1996. Now they want to cut it in half again. So in late 2009 the fee will be about half what it was over 25 years ago in face dollar terms and allowing for inflation, this puts a real dollar value of about an eighth of what it was back then. In all that time our profession has succeeded in making the procedure quicker but also safer and with a faster recovery time and better visual results. We use a lot more high tech equipment now but this makes the procedure more complex, more technically difficult and takes much longer to master, as any training registrar will testify. Basically this ophthalmologist goes on to talk about the public hospital system and why these out-of-hospital cataract operations have expanded. He says it is because you cannot get theatre time in the hospital. In the public hospital system in rural and regional Australia you cannot get theatre time, so of course they are going to be doing more in day surgeries. He says: Up until about six months agothat is the end of last yearthings were going well for our patients. A privately insured patient would get done with no out of pocket expense from me as I accepted ‘no-gap' payments from the funds for my surgery. A patient electing to go public would wait about three months to get done at Wagga Base Hospital. If a non-insured patient wanted to go private, the allup cost would be around $1800 out of pocket, $1100 of which went to the private hospital and the rest split between surgeon and anaesthetist. when it is time for- Since thenand I am talking specifically about the Greater Southern Area Health Service, which has… cut our theatre lists back to 3 per month and never seem to have a dedicated theatre for emergencies, so that the lists we do get are sometimes cancelled for an emergency caesar, trauma case etc. As a result, my public waiting list has now blown out to eleven months and some of my colleagues have longer waits. The worse thing is that the wait list grows by about two months, every month. So this obviously increases the interest and need for people to get their cataracts done outside the hospital system. I was trying to point to whether there is a recognition of the factors that show why there has been more private surgery and why more of these are being done out of hospital. You can see why when you factor in all of the issues and the challenges we are trying to meet in rural and regional areas. He goes on: This will now cost uninsured patients an extra $312 because of the fee cutbackon top of the increases that the hospitals have now applied and… hospital charges for uninsured cataract cases are now $1300 for pensioners and a whopping $2075 for non-pensioners. He talks about how much there will be outof-pocket charges for insured patients et cetera. The problem we have is, I think, that there has been no thought given to how to address rogue issues.

124,Ms OWENS ,"Parramatta) (4.40 pm)-I rise to support the Health Insurance Amendment (Extended Medicare Safety Net) Bill 2009. It is an extremely important bill for the sustainability of the extended Medicare safety net. The purpose of the extended Medicare safety net is to protect patients from high out-of-pocket medical costs for out-of-hospital medical services such as GP and specialist services. Relative to the total health budget it is quite a small component but is an incredibly important one. While most people face out-of-pocket costs of less than $50 a year, some members of the community face significant medical bills for out-of-hospital services. In 2007, around seven per cent of individuals had outof-pocket costs of over $300 per year-add those up for families. And in 2007, 11,000 Australians incurred out-of-pocket costs of more than $2,000 each. The number of people with these very high out-of-pocket costs initially fell after the Howard government introduced the EMSN in 2004 but rose very quickly again shortly after that and has been rising since. The benefits are highly concentrated in certain types of services. In 2007, over 30 per cent of all EMSN benefits helped fund obstetric services and 22 per cent went towards assisted reproductive services. The EMSN has more than doubled the amount of Commonwealth funding going towards these two professional groups. Only eight per cent of the EMSN benefits went towards the funding of general practice consultations. There is also an extremely effective program directing assistance to cancer patients relative to other patients with high healthcare needs. Given that over 50 per cent of EMSN payments go towards people for obstetric services, assisted reproductive services and chronic illnesses, you can see how incredibly important a program it is. It is incredibly important that it is sustainable over the long term so that we can continue to provide assistance to people with the greatest need. It is a relatively new program. It was introduced by the Howard government in 2004 to tackle high out-of-pocket costs for medical services. Under the EMSN, patients are reimbursed 80 per cent of their out-of-pocket costs for all out-of-hospital Medicare services once annual personal expenditure on these reaches a certain threshold, which was indexed annually. Prior to the introduction of the extended safety net in 2004, there was a limit on the amount of government contribution for services. That was done through the Medicare schedule fee. In fact, for the first eight or nine years of the Howard government, contributions to this area were capped by those Medicare schedule fees. But in 2004 that cap was removed and instead 80 per cent of out-of-pocket costs or out-ofhospital services were paid no matter how much the doctor charged. You would expect that, if you removed the cap in that way, there would be some doctors and specialists who would increase their fees or who would think: ‘Okay, I can increase my fee by 50 per cent, or 80 per cent or whatever, and it will still be paid by the 80 per cent contribution for out-of-pocket costs.' Some did and costs started to rise, and between 2007 and 2008 they rose 30 per cent. That rise in the spending on EMSN benefits has not been matched by a drop in patients' out-of-pocket costs. In fact, since its introduction there have been concerns that the EMSN may lead providers to increase fees and thereby dilute the potential benefits to patients. Since the introduction of the EMSN, average fees have increased by around 4.2 per cent per year, excluding general practice and pathology, which have been fairly stable. This increase is over and above the rate of inflation and it is estimated that the EMSN is responsible for 70 per cent of the increase. It was directly responsible for 2.9 per cent increase in fees each year. It comes a question of whether the taxpayer should pick up the increase in fees by the specialists. The rise in costs was also of concern to the Howard government. In fact, in 2005, just one year after the scheme was introduced, concerns were such about the charging of excessive fees by some doctors that the government raised the safety net expenditure threshold so as to reduce the number of people who would qualify for the EMSN and rein in costs. They did not consider capping again at that stage but they did raise threshold, which meant that people had to spend more of their own money before becoming eligible. It reduced access to the scheme. The original thresholds were set at $300 for concession card holders and FTBA recipients, and $700 for all others. Those were increased to $500 and $1,000 in 2005. After indexation, the thresholds now sit at $555.70 for concession card holders and people who receive family tax benefit part A and $1,111.60 for all other singles and families. But costs still continue to rise. Consistent with the fact that people in affluent areas incur more out-of-pocket costs, it was found that some 55 per cent of EMSN benefits is distributed to the top quintile of Australia's most socioeconomically advantaged areas, whereas the least advantaged quintile receives less than 3.5 per cent. That is, 55 per cent for the top quintile and 3.5 per cent for the lowest. In rural areas costs have not increased in the same way. Over time, average out-ofpocket costs increased most in major cities, although the median in the major cities was quite stable, which suggests that the higher out-of-pocket costs in major cities are faced by those at the upper end of the distribution. Interestingly enough, over time the difference between the average and the medium is a actually increasing, showing that the differbeence between the highest-charging specialist and the average-charging specialist has increased dramatically. We know a lot about the nature of the rising costs because there has been extensive review of the program, with a report coming down in 2009. As required under the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Act 2004, a review was undertaken of the operation, effectiveness and implication of the safety net. That was conducted by the Centre for Health Economics Research and Evaluation at the University of Technology in Sydthe ney. The report noted that the safety net has helped patients who have very high costs and has reduced out-of-pocket costs for some patients with cancer, but it clearly showed that there were major concerns in areas such as obstetrics and assisted reproductive technology, including IVF. Fifty per cent of the safety net benefits are paid in those two areas. Medicare benefits have more than doubled for both these groups since the safety net was introduced. A significant proportion of the increase in expenditure is because of the increases in fees charged. There is also a substantial difference between in-hospital and out-of-hospital fees. Between 2003 and 2008, the fees charged by obstetricians for in-hospital services reduced by six per cent while the fees charged for out-of-hospital services increased by 267 per cent. That is an extraordinary difference in changes in fees over a relatively short period of five years. Similarly, the fees charged for assisted reproductive technology services fell by nine per cent for in-hospital services and rose by 62 per cent for out-of-hospital services. This indicates that some doctors have been taking advantage of the safety net as their fees for out-of-hospital services have increased far in excess of the fees that they are charging in hospitals. The report also showed that, while EMSN payments have provided many with financial relief from significant out-of-pocket medical costs, those in the greatest financial need may be missing out on the benefits. The review found that, for every EMSN benefit dollar that is paid to a patient, 78 per cent went towards meeting the doctor's higher fees rather than reducing the patient's out-ofpocket costs. Further, those who have benefited most from affordable services have tended to be in the wealthier areas as they are in a better position to access the more expensive specialist services in the first place. One would expect that costs would rise over four years, but rises have been extraordinary in some areas and quite modest in others. There is also, as I said, the substantial difference between in-hospital and out-ofhospital fees, with extreme variations in fees charged by specialists for the same services. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that taxpayers' money goes to reduce the outof-pocket expenses for the benefit of patients and not to inflate the fees of some specialists in some circumstances. The consequences of fee rises are felt not just by those accessing the extended Medicare safety net but also by people who have not qualified for the safety net and also face those higher costs. This amendment allows the Minister for Health and Ageing to determine the maximum benefit that would be paid under the safety net through a legislative instrument to allow for parliamentary scrutiny. The report identified six areas of particular concern where fees have risen in an irregular way and well above others. Those six specific areas are obstetrics; assisted reproductive technology, including IVF; some cataract operations; some hair transplants; varicose vein treatment; and several procedures involving the injection of a therapeutic substance into an eye. These areas have more than doubled since the safety net was introduced and, disturbingly, this increase is directly accounted for by increases in the fees charged by specialists. In cases such as these, particularly when 50 per cent of the costs associated with this extended Medicare safety net program go to areas such as reproductive health, there was always considerable controversy with any change that was made. We have already heard from the members of the opposition today stories of great pain and grief and joy of people undergoing IVF treatment in recent years under the current laws. We have already heard some of those. We have heard stories of hospitals in regional areas whose departments have shut down or had their funds cut back. That particular issue, of course, is not related to this particular bill, but I would like to cover two particular areas-the cataract area and assisted reproductive technology-because I know that they are areas where it is very easy to frighten people who are already very fearful about what the future might hold for them. When it comes to cataracts, the changes announced in the budget represent the first time in 13 years that a government has reviewed the payment for cataract surgery. Over the past 13 years there has been significant advancement in the technology used to carry out cataract operations, which means that operations can now be performed faster, with better results and with greater safety for changes. patients. The changes made by the government more accurately reflect the time taken to carry out these procedures, which typically, these days, is around 20 minutes. For this 20 minutes of work the new standard Medicare Benefits Schedule fee will be $419.85. To put this into context, currently the cataract procedure takes around 20 minutes and has the same fee as the payment made by government for complex skull surgery, which takes more time to perform and carries a far greater risk for the patient. Ninety-five per cent of cataract procedures are undertaken in hospital. Assisted reproductive technology is also an area where it is very easy to frighten ple who are already afraid that circumstances for them will be worse than they are now. For the vast majority of people undergoing IVF, this will not be the case. On average, patients are charged around $6,000 per IVF cycle, yet some doctors are charging in excess of $10,000 per cycle. Patients who see the specialists who charge around that $6,000 or less will not be worse off under these changes. From 1 January the Medicare items for ART services will also be restructured to better align the items to the phases of treatment involved in the ART cycle. This will help to spread the costs and caps across the treatment cycle to better reflect the costs involved at each stage of the treatment cycle. At the same time the government is also investing $157.6 million in increasing the Medicare rebates for obstetric services, and $120.5 million in maternity services to improve options for women and support those doctors that do not charge high fees. Those changes have been particularly welcome in my electorate. I have met recently with a number of mums who are planning pregnancies in the next few years and are extremely pleased at the greater range of services that will become available because of those The government remains committed to the extended Medicare safety net. It is a very important part of health services in this country and incredibly important for people facing quite difficult times in their lives. In 2008, though, expenditure on the safety net was $414 million, 30 per cent more than it was in 2007. Unless we make these changes now and support people in meeting their reasonable out-of-pocket costs, this expenditure will continue to grow rapidly. As a government, we cannot continue to see costs rise because of the rise in excessive fees at the upper end of a few small sections of our medical services. This bill creates a mechapeo- nism by which the government can responsibly manage the safety net, and it is extremely important for supporting the sustainability of the safety net so that singles and families can continue to receive this incredibly important assistance with their out-of-pocket costs.",83
125,Ms ROXON ,"Gellibrand-Minister for Health and Ageing) (4.57 pm)-in reply-In summing up I would like to thank members for their contributions to the debate on this bill. It gives me great pleasure to follow the member for Parramatta, who canvassed so many health issues for her electorate. This is important to many people in the community, so I appreciate that people have taken the time to speak in the debate. The Health Insurance Amendment (Extended Medicare Safety Net) Bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 to enable the Minister for Health and Ageing to determine by legislative instrument the maximum benefit payable under the extended Medicare safety net for each Medicare Benefits Schedule item. These changes, made by the government in the budget, ensure that all items currently covered by the safety net remain covered by the safety net and no items will be means tested for eligibility. Importantly, IVF services will remain covered, with no age limits and no limitations on the number of cycles. Members, including the member for Cook, who have very personal stories and genuine concern about these changes should be assured that all IVF procedures that are currently covered will continue to be covered. There is still, I think, some remaining concern in the community, some confusion, about the speculation compared to the reality that all items will continue to be covered, with no age limits, no limitation on the number of cycles and no means-testing. The changes, of course, go to a cap on the amount that can be charged-and I will come to that later-but I think that they should address the concerns, genuine as they are, from people like the member for Cook. Cancer services, as well, will not be affected at all by these changes. The changes that we have made are to restrict taxpayer funds being spent on excessive fees that have been charged by some specialists. We are protecting the taxpayers, we are protecting the patients, and we are protecting those doctors who are doing the right thing in charging moderate fees. A recent independent review of the extended Medicare safety net, a report tabled before this debate began, clearly showed that in certain areas, such as obstetrics and IVF, the safety net had been used by specialist doctors to raise their fees knowing that the taxpayer would be called on to cover 80 per cent of the cost of the fee rise. For example, according to this report, between 2003 and 2008 the fees charged by obstetricians for inhospital services reduced by six per cent while the fees charged for out-of-hospital services increased by a staggering 267 per cent. The report also showed that the safety net is not making some medical services more affordable for some patients-which, of course, was the purpose for which it was originally intended. One of the reasons for this is that the amount of benefit available through the extended Medicare safety net is unlimited, and some specialists have taken advantage of this arrangement to increase their fees and their incomes, unfortunately with no particular benefit to the patient. The current nature of the safety net means that doctors feel little pressure to moderate their fees. Due to these fee rises for some services some patient outof-pocket expenses have even increased as a result of the extended Medicare safety net. Unless we act now we will not be able to stop this increasingly silly situation and the extended Medicare safety net will become unsustainable. In 2008, expenditure on the extended Medicare safety net was $414 million, 30 per cent more than the previous year. In some areas the increase is being driven by increased fees rather than the provision of more services. This bill creates a mechanism for the government to responsibly manage expenditure on the extended Medicare safety net. As part of the 2009-10 budget the government is capping the benefits for some services where there is evidence of large increases in the fees charged, services where the majority of the extended Medicare safety net benefit is going to doctors rather than to helping patients. The new caps will apply for the following services: obstetrics, assisted reproductive technology, hair transplantation, the injection of a therapeutic substance into an eye, one type of cataract operation and one type of varicose vein treatment. Some members in the debate have expressed the concern that this measure will increase the cost of obstetric services but I note that as part of this measure the government will also be investing $156.7 million to increase the Medicare rebates for private obstetric services. This means that the changes will allow all mothers who have their babies delivered by a private doctor to receive a standard Medicare rebate that is 30 per cent higher than the current rebate. The government is also investing $120.5 million in a maternity services package. Part of this package will introduce Medicare items for midwifery services and will support greater choice for women-one of the issues touched upon by the member for Parramatta. The cost of IVF should not increase for most patients. On average, patients are charged around $6,000 per IVF cycle, yet there are some doctors charging in excess of $10,000 per cycle. Patients who see specialists who charge $6,000 or less for a typical IVF cycle will not be worse off under these changes. In relation to the cap on the cataract item, I think that the opposition health spokesperson is confused. The extended Medicare safety net only applies to out-ofhospital services. There is, of course, a rate measure which affects cataracts, to which he may have been referring. While I acknowledge that there is a crossover for a small number of services, 95 per cent of private cataract procedures take place as inpatient services so the extended Medicare safety net does not apply. I note, also, the closing comments of the opposition spokesperson for health, who offered to work with the government to identify alternative savings. That was a very kind offer in this debate, but we have not had one suggestion from the opposition for any savings in any health related measure, let alone any measure relating to this bill or in this budget debate. We have had no suggestions, no policy proposals-nothing. In fact, all we have had so far is opposition to any of the measures that we have proposed in Health. So I do ask where those suggestions are. I would be happy to see them and consider them but they have not been forthcoming to date and I am not intending to hold my breath while I wait for them. I did wonder if the opposition spokesperson was suggesting that the opposition would now be opposing this bill. Of course, the shadow Treasurer clearly stated, following the budget: We're not going to block any initiatives other than the private health insurance initiative. So that's our position. We're not changing from it. So I wonder whether the member for Dickson and the member for North Sydney are not in agreement here, because it seems that the shadow minister is raising some sort of issue that might be walking away from the commitment made by the member for North Sydney. The important point here is that the extended Medicare safety net is a patient benefit. It is not intended to be a mechanism by which doctors can simply increase their incomes. The changes we have made will restrict taxpayer funds from being spent on sepaexcessive fees that have been charged by some specialists while protecting those very many doctors who are doing the right thing. Importantly, it will continue to protect patients with high medical costs and protect taxpayers. The changes in this bill are necessary to assist us in keeping the safety net sustainable and available to all Australians into the future. These changes will allow Australian families to continue to have access to the safety net for IVF services into the future and they will allow access to the safety net by families of cancer patients, who have very high costs that need to be covered in difficult circumstances, and by many other worthy recipients, without this money being unfairly skimmed off by that small number of doctors who are charging excessive fees. The government is determined to put the patient first and foremost in all of our considerations, and we believe that this bill does that. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (TRAINING INCENTIVES) BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 May, on motion by Mr Brendan O'Connor: That this bill be now read a second time.",89
127,Dr SOUTHCOTT ,"Boothby) (5.06 pm)-I am pleased to speak on the Social Security Amendment (Training Incentives) Bill 2009 and indicate that the opposition will not be opposing this legislation. It is worth looking back 18 months because the government have now been in place for a little bit more than 18 months and it is time to deliver a mid-term report card on them. When you look specifically at the area of youth unemployment, you see in only 18 months a terrible performance in jobs for teenagers, young Australians. Looking back to November 2007, specifically at 15to 19year-old Australians, there were 257,000 in full-time jobs, compared with 222,400 now. There are almost 35,000 fewer teenagers in full-time jobs now than when the Rudd government was first elected. There are 31,000 fewer teenagers in jobs in total. There are now an extra 4,300 teenagers who are unemployed. We have also seen very large falls in the participation rate for teenagers, from 60.4 per cent to 57.4 per cent and in the employment rate for teenagers-that is, the employment-to-population ratio-from 51 per cent to 47.8 per cent. That is a big change in just 18 months. The lesson of previous recessions, of the early 1980s and early 1990s, is that people who are just entering the labour force for the first time are often hit much harder. Youth unemployment in Australia generally rises at twice the rate of total unemployment. When we look at 15to 24-year-olds, we see almost 70,000 fewer full-time jobs and 32,500 more unemployed. The unemployment rate for those looking for full-time work is up from 9.8 per cent to 12.4 per cent. The overall unemployment rate is up from 9.7 per cent to 11.4 per cent. This is in just 18 months. The participation rate for these young Australians has fallen from 71.2 per cent to 69.4 per cent, and the employment rate, or employment-to-population ratio, has fallen almost three per cent, from 64.1 per cent to 61.2 per cent. When you look at the labour force as a whole, over the last 12 months the economy has lost about 60,000 full-time jobs and there have been about 100,000 part-time jobs created. When you look at the losses that have occurred in the 15to 24-year-old age group, there have been 70,000 full-time jobs lost in the Australian economy, and that is equivalent to the entire loss of full-time jobs in the Australian economy over the last 12 months. So this group is definitely bearing the brunt of the global financial crisis, but the Rudd government has introduced some specific policies that will disproportionately affect young Australians and their opportunities to get a start and to get a job. The bungled Job Services Australia will see massive disruption in the area of employment services, such that 47 per cent of job seekers will be changing their provider and changing their case worker on 1 July, at a time when unemployment is rising. We have heard from industry groups, from Restaurant and Catering, from pharmacies and from newsagents that the award modernisation process will again lead to the loss of jobs, and, typically, a lot of these jobs entry-level jobs for young people. We have heard from a variety of groups that the government's Fair Work Bill will again be job destroying. These are three specific decisions that the government have taken. It is no wonder they are having to pump out billions and billions of dollars without having any idea of how many jobs will be created or supported when they have made specific decisions which go to the heart of the opportunities that there will be in the labour market. There are two parts to this bill. The first part is for a temporary training supplement of $41.60 per fortnight to eligible job seekers on Newstart or parenting payment who undertake approved training. These will be job seekers who do not have a year 12 or equivalent level qualification, or who have a trade or vocational qualification that can be upgraded to help them find work. The payment will be available from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2011. The opposition are not opposed to training, but we believe that training is only one limb or one element of getting someone into a job. One of the weaknesses of the government's approach has been a complete failure to create a climate of strong job creation. Labor have failed to define a clear pathway between training and a job. There is a training mantra but not a jobs mantra. It is critical that unemployment is addressed by boosting business confidence and encouraging employers to take on new employees. The training supplement is something we do not oppose, but, again, we believe that it is critical to demonstrate how this will lead into employment. The second part of the bill relates to amending the participation requirements for certain young people, requiring them to either earn or learn to be eligible for youth allowance. The opposition supports this apwill be proach. Over the last 12 months we have seen the number of teenagers who are not in full-time education or full-time employment increase from fewer than 200,000-about 195,000-to 242,000. What we know is that people who are not in full-time education and not in full-time employment traditionally will languish and have trouble remaining in the labour force over their lifetimes. As I said earlier, during past economic downturns youth unemployment has increased disproportionately. It is critical that we ensure that young people do not become disengaged and disenfranchised. One of the concerns about the labour force statistics is that we are seeing very large falls in the participation rates of young Australians. We have seen in a period of 18 months very dramatic falls in the participation rates of young Australians. It is critical that we do keep people engaged in the labour market and we do keep people actively looking for work. As I said, the opposition does support the tightening-up of youth allowance. But, again, it is only one aspect of improving youth unemployment and providing more opportunities for younger Australians. There are lots of aspects that need to be addressed so that employers will take on extra workers so there will be the jobs there for younger Australians. As I said at the start, what we have seen is disappearing jobs for younger Australians-full-time jobs and overall jobs-and big falls in the participation rate and the ployment rate. So, whilst training and education can certainly boost employability, training is not for everyone and not everyone gains a benefit from training. The experience around the world is that training programs can be very expensive and actually have quite poor employment outcomes. We believe it is important to tailor approaches to the individual. The opposition will be looking very carefully at the labour force figures, ‘learn or earn' is not a cynical attempt to distort and manipulate the unemployment figures as people who would otherwise be looking for work are pushed into training in order to claim income support payments. We do not want to see a return to the training treadmill and many of the training programs of Working Nation, which actually had very poor employment outcomes and very low chances of people going from those programs into a job. We will be watching the figures on youth unemployment very carefully. We think that this is a critical area to address for the future because it is very important that people do remain engaged, do remain active, so that they have a much stronger connection with the labour force over their lives.",89
128,Ms HALL ,"Shortland) (5.18 pm)-I rise to very strongly support the Social Security Amendment (Training Incentives) Bill 2009 before us today. As a person who in a past life worked with young people who were looking for work, and as a person who has had a lot to do with the actual training aspects of young people and workers generally, I feel that this ‘learn or earn' legislation is very important. At the commencement of my contribution to this debate I would like to very strongly emphasise that to let young people who are unemployed languish, without any assistance from government, is despicable. What this legislation will do when it em- is enacted is see that that does not happen. What I also think is despicable is for young people with poor skills, poor literacy and poor numeracy to be penalised and to be thrown on the backburner and totally disregarded-put into a Work for the Dole program, if there is one available, but at no time really having the issues that go to that person's employability addressed. I think this legislation actually looks at some of those issues and will provide hope and a start for ensuring that young people. In the past few years we have had a government-not the Rudd government but the previous government-that really squandered opportunities and did not train those people for the jobs that were available. We had a chronic skills shortage here in Australia at a time when our economy was thriving, when there was this great need for people to fill the jobs that were vacant. It would have been an excellent opportunity for the then government to embrace legislation like that we are debating here tonight, legislation that would have ensured that young people were prepared for work and that they were moving forward and being placed in a situation where they could make a tangible contribution to our economy, where they had the skills that they needed to enter the workforce and where they could undertake ongoing training. This bill will amend the Social Security Act 1991 to provide for training supplements for eligible recipients of parenting payment and Newstart allowance who have not completed year 12 or equivalent or who seek to upgrade their vocational qualifications and who commence approved training or further education between 1 July 2009 and 30 June 2011. So, here you see the target group: young people who have not completed year 12 or equivalent and who really do not have the education or the skills that they need to enter the workforce. On my way into the chamber I believe I heard the shadow minister for employment participation saying that unemployment has risen. Yes, it has risen, and we acknowledge that on this side of the chamber. We also acknowledge that the global financial crisis is having an enormous impact on employment but not as big an impact in Australia as it is having elsewhere. We see this as an opportunity to provide that training for young people. The legislation also amends the participation requirement for youth allowance, where a person under 20 years of age has not completed year 12 or an equivalent certificate level II to level IV qualification. A youth allowance will be payable to young people without year 12 or equivalent if they study full-time or if they comply with the Youth Allowance Employment Pathway Plan. I need to talk a little bit about the employment pathway plan. It is absolutely imperative that a young person with limited training, maybe sometimes a less than perfect education and very few skills determines a goal and works out how they are going to achieve that goal. In working towards that goal they will have a number of strategies. In those strategies they will list the steps that need to be taken for them to gain the qualification and gain a job at the end. For instance, an early school leaver may feel that they would make an excellent horticulturalistthey like being outdoors, they like gardening and they do not mind hard work-but they are unaware of what they need to do to obtain a position working in horticulture. For that person an employment pathway plan needs to be developed whereby they will be able to undertake the certificate-level courses that meet the requirements of the job. They will follow it up with some work experience and on-the-job training as well as some formal off-the-job training. The pathway plan will require at least 25 hours a week in a combination of part-time study or training and other approved activities, which could be on-the-job training, which I think is important because it is all part of helping the young person to develop the skills that they need to enter the workforce. Some exemptions will apply. We know that training may be reasonably available for a person but the person may not have the capacity to undertake the available training. That could occur in a situation where the young person lives in quite a remote area, where there is only training at a much higher level than the person has the basic skills to undertake or where the person has a disability and needs to undertake a specialised form of training. The training supplement has a financial impact of $83.1 million in additional spending over four years, so you can see that the government is making a significant contribution to the training of young Australians. The government is prepared to invest at this particular time in Australia's future. That is what this is; it is investing in training young people for Australia's future so that when things improve globally and within the Australian economy-when more jobs become available-we will have young people with the skills who can walk into those jobs. We will be competitive not only within Australia but globally. The measure also amends the participation requirements for 15to 20-year-olds and has a net financial cost of $14.4 million over four years. The training supplement is an additional time-limited payment of $41.60 per fortnight. That training allowance is an incentive to young people to undertake the training. The budget announcement for this measure stated that changes to the participation requirement for Youth Allowance will come into effect on 1 July this year and for new claimants without year 12 or equivalent from 1 January 2010. The budget announcements also state that the training supplements will commence from 1 July this year. So it is very important that this legislation gets through the parliament in this sitting. It is very important that we are prepared to provide the training that these young people need. The bill will also assist low-skilled job seekers with the costs of participation in training or further education which may assist them to obtain employment in the future. Job seekers will need to participate in approved education or training to receive the training supplements. Some people might study full-time; some might study part-time. Partial capacity to work will come into play. People doing courses that go for longer than a 12-month period may be eligible for student income support payments. The fact that this legislation is targeting low-skilled workers is very important for us here in the parliament to consider. We need to upskill our workforce. As I mentioned at the commencement of my contribution to this debate, one of the big mistakes that the previous government made was failing to skill our workforce and failing to train people for the jobs that were available in Austratoring lia. It was such a missed opportunity. At that particular time, we had job vacancies and a very significant youth unemployment rate. What we are doing is addressing the needs of young people and the needs of Australia. The bill will also encourage more young people to gain the education and skills that they need to move into further education. It is not only employment that is important. Success at a lower level course gives young people the confidence to move on to courses that will set them up for a career for their rest of their lives. That career could start with an apprenticeship or otherwise; the employment could be in any job that young people find that they are interested in. Some young job seekers who participate in the Productivity Places Program, which is another aspect of this legislation, will not have to pay for their courses. However, not all courses taken up through the PPP will fit into that category. This is recognition that some people need more help. There is not a member in this House who would deny the fact that there are definitely a lot of young people out there who, through no fault of their own, find themselves in quite disadvantaged situations. The PPP will work well with that particular group of young people. Once again, this legislation is looking after particularly disadvantaged young people. This legislation has been quite well received. I note that ACOSS are a little cautious but cautiously supportive of the proposal. They state that they will be looking closely at the youth allowance conditions so that disadvantaged young Australians are not unfairly penalised, which is what happened under the previous administration. These young Australians were unfairly penalised but not given the training that they needed. ACOSS also said that they acknowledge that there is a need for ongoing training and menthat suits the circumstances of young people. The National Union of Students said: It is good to see that the government is expanding the number of tertiary and training places. A renewed government focus on education will help generations through the recession. That is exactly right. They also said, however, that the COAG policies must not be all stick and no carrot. That was a problem under the previous government. For anything to be successful, you need to make sure that you have the mixture of carrot and stick right. There will be a significant number of places available as part of the youth compact with the state and territory governments. There is a commitment to immediate action to ensure significant school and training places are available for people aged 15 to 19 who are entitled to an education or training place. This must be fully implemented by 1 July this year. Once again, this is a commitment by government to young people. It will ensure that they have a future. The government is prepared to get behind them and offer them the training and the skills that they need to enter the workforce. As I mentioned previously, part of that plan includes on-thejob and off-the-job training. I see that as viding very broad and full training to young people. In addition, young people aged 20 to 24 will have an entitlement to education and training. This commitment will be implemented by 1 January 2010. State and territory governments will work with their education authorities and training providers to make arrangements for determining eligibility for an entitlement place. It is anticipated that most places will be provided by TAFEs and some registered private training organisations offering government subsidised qualifications. The Commonwealth, states and territories will work together to ensure that those young people living in rural and remote areas will also get the access that they not only need but deserve. This legislation provides hope for a future for young people. Changes in this legislation support the youth compact and the national youth participation requirements agreed by COAG on 30 April 2009. This measure will also assist in bringing forward the COAG targets of 90 per cent year 12 or equivalent attainment rates for 2015 to 2020. The training supplement will be available for two years to provide enhanced incentives for job seekers to gain skills and qualifications during the global recession. This legislation is about government acting. This is about the Rudd government recognising that young people deserve a future, and it is investing in their future by giving them opportunities to undertake training so as to prepare themselves for jobs as they become available.",91
129,Mr TUCKEY ,"O'Connor) (5.37 pm)-In her closing statement, the member for Shortland ran one of the recitation issues that this parliament is now confronted with in terms of ‘a government acting'. There is only way to describe the Social Security Amendment (Training Incentives) Bill 2009, and that is ‘a progovernment reacting'. It is reacting to a very significant fall in employment, particularly amongst young people. It is, of course, the outcome of recession, including-as the minister reminded us during her second reading speech-the recession that we had to have in the 1990s, when it was again young people in particular who found employment very hard to obtain. Another factor that is making it difficult for young people to get employment is the simple fact that employers are preparing themselves for the introduction of the Fair Work Australia legislation on 1 July. We see daily reports in the media of efforts by the trade union movement to further extend its power and, from its perspective, hopefully its revenues. This is to generate enough money to run another misleading campaign to try to convince the working people of Australia that this government should remain in office, knowing full well that we are not part of the trade union appreciation society. We are not dependent upon its funding to win or lose elections. This has been highlighted by the most recent unemployment statistics, which show a fall in the number of people in permanent employment from 25,000 to 20,000. The unemployment figures were compensated by a similar number in casual employment. And, of course, employment is going to go casual because that is the protective mechanism that small business employers will put into their arrangements to ensure that they do not get caught in the ‘go away' money trap that was significant with the previous unfair dismissal exercise. That legislation just became unfair to employers who were silly enough to give people a full-time job and who, for whatever reason, found later that they had to disconnect from those people-and probably for very good reason, as was frequently raised with my office. For example, one small business man put on two workers and, at the end of 12 months, the business that he had anticipated had not materialised. He very apologetically put off these two people, paid them in excess of their entitlement and then received claims from each of them for $10,000 for unfair dismissal. He rang his industrial adviser and said, ‘I'll fight these rotten devils to the High Court.' His adviser said, ‘And how much are they asking for?' and he said, ‘$10,000 each.' His adviser said: ‘Pay them. You'll win your case but it'll cost you more than that to do so.' That is coming up. Small business learnt its lesson last time. The reverse applied when the Howard government discontinued unfair dismissal legislation for employers with fewer than 100 workers and, as a result, 50,000 jobs materialised in a month. In both New South Wales and Victoria-the typical rust bucket states that were not benefiting from the huge growth in resources exports-jobs materialised not because they were necessarily new jobs but because people had the confidence to employ people on a full-time basis. As history also tells us, there was a time when it was not unusual for young people to leave the workforce after year 10 and enter into on-the-job apprenticeships and other on-the-job training positions. In years gone by, this did not even include TAFE training, which I think is a necessary part of today's arrangements. But, again, we wonder why employers are not breaking their necks to take on apprentices and trainees in various categories when they are paid at a rate that does not equate to their productive effort and, more particularly, sees them absent from their workplace one or two days a week for training. No compensation of consequence is paid to employers for having those people unavailable on those days. These situations have arisen. This legislation proposes that the taxpayer picks up some of that tab, and that may therefore be advantageous, not for people in work but for people who are not in work. It is referred to-and I endorse this principle-as ‘learn or earn'. Whilst I do not disagree with a reasonable safety net, it has unfortunately been found by a lot of young people to be sufficient to get by on, and they then do not seriously seek employment. If I were to be given a couple of hours to speak on this issue in this place, I could run through a list of examples where I and members of my extended family, as employers, have had unemployed persons turn up at our places of business for the purpose of doing an interview and, in their opening remarks, say: ‘We don't want this job, you know. We're not going to take it. We'll really be a nuisance to you if you employ us.' They were there to get a signature in their book to say that they had been out actively seeking work. This provision may do something in that regard and that of course will be a positive. I can see that it is a means of assisting. It is going to cost substantial amounts of money-$83.1 million is targeted to dateand, in fact, job seekers meeting these requirements will receive an extra $41.60 per fortnight if they undertake an approved training or further education course of less than 12 months duration at the certificate II, III IV level. But let me return to the issue as to why it now appears that by year 10 you have not absorbed enough education to take a job in the trades or elsewhere, as was previously the case. One can say, ‘Oh well, it's all computerised now.' That is a complexity. That seems to be one of the things that most kids know about and understand before they go to school. I was talking to someone the other day who had to ring their grandchild to help them sort out a software problem they were experiencing with their computer at home. That is wonderful and we read about this all over the place. I once learnt to fly a Chipmunk aeroplane and its only form of navigation was a marine compass. If I were to try to fly a current model of aeroplane today without high levels of computer skills, I would not be able to get it off the ground. Unfortunately, we recently read of a disaster where computers were suddenly interrupted and how difficult it was for a professional pilot to fly a commercial aircraft. A farmer in my electorate of O'Connor is now employing equipment which literally drives itself very accurately. So there is a need for that form of training. On the other hand, as reported in the media recently, three young mothers turned up at a picture theatre and, for reasons not stated, could not work out how much was three times the entry fee of $9. That is not an indictment of those people but an indictment of an education system that has probably turned them out in year 10 with the inability to say that three nines are 27. Why is that? Because, quite foolishly, we walked away from the education structures that made sure everybody knew those basic forms of multiplication. I ran hotels for about 25 to 30 years and I employed a vast number of staff on about one hour's assessment. The first thing I looked at was whether they walked fast or or slowly, but each and every one of those people, particularly the women, had the ability to add up. They could not go to the electronic machine that is now provided and is about the slowest way of dispensing alcohol I have ever seen in my life. I do not know how you can have an alcopops problem. They could add up and they did add up as they put the drinks order together and told the group to which they were supplying the drinks the price. How did they learn that? There were no computers to assist. The cash register was of the push-down variety on which you registered the amount involved; you did not get a message from the register telling you what the change was. You had to work it out yourself. These were young and not-so-young men and women who could add up without any difficulty. From my own recollection, when you walked into a school in the opening period you heard kids in every classroom reciting their times tables. They were actually taught to read by phonetics. And where are we now? We are back to phonics. We have gone back to having that debate after the elite education establishment undermined all the practical outcomes that equipped a young person to enter employment after year 10. As I have said, there are certain technical aspects to this bill-I read the statistics in the second reading speech of the Minister for Education-but without an adequate basic education another year's training is not going to do much and, if that year's training is needed to repair the incapacity of a young person to read and write, should we be building new assembly halls or, better, should we be organising the teaching profession so that we can turn out young people with the basic three Rs education? I think that is a matter of grave concern. All the talk in this parliament about how much money is being spent on education and training is irrelevant unless it delivers outcomes. I smiled today when the minister was explaining that she was going to shift money from a school to which it had been allocated-the school was going to be knocked down-to a school where the other pupils were going to go. That amalgamated school might be brand new, but it is still ing to get the money. I note on one occasion the government obviously woke up to that fact and said, ‘Well, we had better not spend it on paint; we will spend it on computers.' I thought computers were coming free under another program. Are we just recycling money? Is it going to be free computers one day and a coat of paint the next day? As I said in my speech on the appropriations, very few of about the 150 schools in my electorate chose to take the $150,000 on offer. They did not take it because the opinion of the school principal and the parent associations was that they did not need that much. They are now being told to spend up to $3 million or else, yet internally the system is still advising us that young people who have not completed year 12 have an inadequate education base on which to obtain employment. That was never the case, and it need not be the case, notwithstanding that there are good reasons for most students to continue to year 12 provided they have a capacity to absorb the education that that system provides. But what if it does not and a student's tendency is to be a highly skilled tradesperson? It is a great tragedy of history that some of the most highly skilled tradesmen I have met going back to my childhood have had very little education. But they were highly skilled in their trade, and that has changed somewhat because a trade is not so manual. What I am saying is this: these ideas cannot be criticised and we hope they work, but they are an indictment of the existing education system because they should not be needed; the training should not be needed. There is another problem that arises from that and, furthermore, I can quote examples. You have got to be very careful as an administrator to see that training does not become an excuse for doing nothing. In recent years I know of people who said, ‘I'm going back to do another course,' and left full-time paid go- employment because a course was easier than turning up for seven hours a day in a job. So that is a problem. You get people who are perennially doing courses, and the evidence of that exists for anyone who wants to check the stats or talk to people who have employed persons who have often come to them as unemployed. I think that is another worthwhile comment to make in this debate. In the five minutes left available to me, I note that this legislation deals with some of the principles and entry requirements for youth allowance. On the last sitting Thursday I presented to this parliament 6,280-as I think the number was-signatures on a petition collected in fewer than 10 days from people protesting about the unfair changes to the Youth Allowance system. It pops up here in a most interesting way when the minister says, to support these initiatives, the Commonwealth government committed to making education and training a precondition ‘for young people without year 12, or the equivalent, to obtain youth allowance (other) and family tax benefit part A'. The youth allowance took into account the fact that young people, having passed year 12, were typically wishing to enter university and often-as in the case of my electorate-were living an unacceptable travel distance from the place of learning, which required their relocation, and that the rent allowance component of youth allowance was extremely important to them. They could prove their independence by going to work where work was available. The interesting thing about this is that, while we talk about the new conditions, which have nothing to do with parental income and all those sorts of things, they are still a roadblock to participation. Whilst the minister, in her second reading speech, admits that it is very difficult for any young person to get a job at the moment, in the same breath she says, ‘But if you can't find one for 30 hours a week then you can't qualify for youth allowance.' In rural areas that does not happen. What students did under the old system was to take the seasonal work, which is now the norm through rural areas, whereby they could work long hours for good rates of pay and accumulate a sum of money-I think it reached about $19,000and that was then their proven qualification to obtain youth allowance and take themselves off to university, where hopefully some of them might have even studied science and other scientific disciplines and went back and taught young people. In fact, now we are funding the cost of laboratories and all of these newly equipped facilities in education establishments-and hooray for that-but there is nobody with the competence to teach within the repaired or renewed or rebuilt facilities. You would not let most of them loose with a Bunsen burner. So how is that going to work? It is just another indictment of this legislastructure tion. We do not oppose it. We wish it well, but it would not be occurring in this fashion if, when young people came out of education and were not seeking an academic career, they could have the necessary basic skills to be employed and in fact to grow into the highly qualified skills which traditionally they learned in the workplace-and learned them extremely well, as those of us know who still have the opportunity to walk into older style houses and see how they were built with a hammer, nails and handsaws and that sort of equipment no longer used to any great extent. (Time expired) Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (5.58 pm)-I rise to speak in support of the Social Security Amendment (Training Incentives) Bill 2009. Before I go to the key areas of the bill, I will comment on some of the notable statements by the member for O'Connor. Firstly, I sincerely disagree with the member for O'Connor's statement that he would not let most teachers loose with Bunsen burners. I think that there are some fantastic teachers out there who should be commended for the work that they are doing. We need to make sure that we are supporting those teachers. I am sure that, if the member for O'Connor looked beyond the Building the Education Revolution funding that is being provided by this government and actually looked at this government's overall policy in relation to our education revolution, he and many of the members on the other side of the House would see that this government has committed to an overall approach to improving education in our schools, both public and private, across this country and that that includes working on a national curriculum and a whole range of initiatives. Certainly the schools in my area welcome the debate and discussion on these key areas as much as they welcome the investment in school infrathat they believe is also important. The member for O'Connor seems to be arguing that we should make sure that students are fully equipped for the workforce by grade 10. You would almost be led to believe, based on the comments just made by the member for O'Connor, that we should get rid of grades 11 and 12 altogether because everyone should be suitable for the workforce by grade 10. Mr Tuckey interjectingMONICA",94
130,The DEPUTY SPEAKER ,"Mr KJ Thomson)-Order! The member for O'Connor will cease interjecting. Mrs D'ATH-The member for O'Connor can argue all he wants, but comments were made over and over again during that speech on this bill that we should make sure that students are fully equipped for the workforce by grade 10. That seems to be the benchmark, not grade 12. The problem is that businesses want more than that nowadays, which the member for O'Connor and other members on the other side of the House would know if they actually went and talked to them. Businesses actually want students to have grade 12 or equivalent qualifications or they want those students to take on further education. It is not acceptable to merely have a grade 10 qualification. The member for O'Connor may say, ‘Well, that's because the kids of today aren't taught phonics and aren't taught times tables.' I disagree because my sevenand nineyear-olds are reciting the times tables that they are being taught in a state school and they are also learning to read and write through phonics. That sort of learning is cerin tainly still going on in our schools and we should commend our teachers for still teaching those important fundamental aspects of education. But we cannot ignore that computers are not just part of our schooling and our businesses but part of our way of life now. We also need to teach our young people in primary school and secondary school to adapt with that technology as it evolves over the years. I have no complaint about the government, the taxpayer dollars, picking up this incentive. This government has been committed since the day it got into government in 2007 about skills and skills enhancement. For more than the last decade under the Howard government what we saw was a complete reversal when it came to investment in skills. We saw it with money being pulled out of the TAFE system. We saw it with the lack of commitment towards incentives for trade training. Although we saw a government creating and building Australian technical colleges around the country, spending millions and millions of dollars establishing ATCs, what it did not do was invest in trade training in many other areas, including in our schools. What we saw was a major drain on skills in this country in the trades area. By 2007, employers were absolutely screaming out for a government which would take up the need to address skills. This bill provides two major incentives. One is a training supplement, eligible to people who are receiving the parent payment and the Newstart allowance. It provides an additional incentive and financial support for those who do not have year 12 qualifications or the equivalent to go back and get further qualifications or a qualification beyond their schooling years. This will ensure that those people can enhance their prospects of employment by allowing them to acquire skills a trade or a field. It may be different to the VET qualification that some of them may already have. This is very important. A time frame has been set out for this initiative. Between 1 July 2009 and 30 June 2011, persons who commence the approved training, who are on the parenting payment or Newstart allowance and who commence a course of 12 months or less in an accredited course can access this additional payment of $41.60 per fortnight to assist them-not just to assist them financially while they undertake those studies but, importantly, to assist them in becoming more work ready and more able to compete equitably in the market when it comes to finding employment. The second initiative is the changes to the participation requirements for the youth allowance (other) category. These initiatives are directed particularly at younger people in our communities who may have left school early and who can truly benefit by going back and getting qualifications or additional qualifications in a certificate under the Australian Qualifications Framework. These are the types of certificate that employers are looking for and the types of skills that employers are looking for out there in the community right now, at a time when the global economic crisis is being felt across this country. It is being felt locally in my communities in my electorate. Incentives like this for ple who have not completed their full education at school are significantly beneficial. I had the opportunity to briefly look at the 2006 census data for the electorate of Petrie. Out of the just over 101,000 people who responded to the question about their highest level of education, 40 per cent had a highest level of education of grade 10 or its equivalent or lower. Although many of those would be older now-and it is true to say that in recent years more young people have been staying at school for longer-we still have too many young people dropping out of school before completing their year 12 or equivalent qualification. In my electorate, I would welcome initiatives like this that will support those people in getting those sorts of qualifications. I know from personal experience how hard it can be when you do not finish your schooling. I left school just after grade 10, when I was 15 years old, and it was not until I was in my early 20s that I went back to night school and started doing my senior equivalent. It is true, as was said in the ond reading speech in relation to these incentives, that those who go back and do further education early in their life are more likely continue that education. Certainly for me, after doing my senior at night school in my early 20s, I then spent the next 14 years studying until I was admitted as a lawyer at the end of the process. If I am any example, there is encouragement so that, once you get back into studying, you are more inclined to continue taking on new skills and enhancing your qualifications. I am not saying that every person who may take up this incentive would necessarily do that; what I am saying is that, by creating these incentives, even if one person takes up this initiative, gains additional qualifications and consequently gets a job out of doing so, then these sorts of incentives are worth doing. I certainly compeo- mend the Rudd Labor government for putting these initiatives in place. In addition to the federal government's commitment to growing our skills base for this country, I can say that the Queensland government equally has that approach. In 2007, the Queensland government introduced changes to its schooling system that saw the introduction of the prep year across every school. I was fortunate that my son was in that first prep year and I have seen the benefits come from the introduction of that year. Also the state government introduced at the same time a learn or earn approach to senior students. They said to the senior students that, if they wanted to leave school before grade 12, then they were expected to be either studying full-time in some other way or going into the workforce and getting a job. I certainly support those initiatives. I understand, as do many youth workers in my electorate, that this is not always going to be the case and there are going to be young people in every electorate who have difficulties for a whole range of reasons. They may sec- be homeless, have substance abuse issues or have mental health issues. There are a whole range of issues that young people may be to facing. That will mean that these people cannot necessarily meet the requirements for the new youth allowance participation. What I am pleased to say is that, as part of this bill, there is the ability in those circumstances for young people to get a waiver, an exemption and to be considered in that context in relation to their particular circumstances. I am pleased with that because, as I said, it was certainly a concern raised by youth workers in my electorate. Having said that I believe that those people, some of the most vulnerable young people in our community, are the ones we should be helping the most to overcome the personal circumstances that they are facing, whatever they may be, so that they can earn qualifications and become someone who has selfesteem, who believes that they can go out and compete in the workforce like any other person and have new skills and the confidence to get a job, and to have the quality of life that every person in this country deserves to have. For all of those reasons I commend this bill to the House.",99
131,Mr CRAIG THOMSON ,"Dobell) (6.12 pm)-Last week I was able to attend the launch of a very positive initiative put together by group training and registered training organisations which operate in my electorate of Dobell on the Central Coast of New South Wales. This particular initiative was called Adopt an Apprentice program and aims to find new employers willing to take on apprentices who have unfortunately lost their places with other small businesses because of the economic downturn or through similar circumstances. At the launch of the program the future was looking brighter for 20 job seekers who formed the target number under this program. Out of the 20, five places had already been found as the program was being launched, so there were already five apprentices with new employers. The fact that employers are willing to take on young apprentices who have had to be put off elsewhere is largely because these job seekers already have some training, experience and skills. Also the truth is that these young people are ready and willing to work. They have confidence because they have shown up to their workplaces. Their employers and work mates have supported and encouraged them. Their confidence came through being backed up by skills learned and training received while on the job. They are ready to try again with a new employer; someone who is willing to take on a keen young person, who, in turn, wants to get ahead with his or her apprenticeship and reach the goal they set out to achieve at the start, and that is to be trade qualified. One of the registered trainers at the launch raised concerns about the lack of apprentices generally in the workplace. The man was in his 50s and had worked at Garden Island with over 400 apprentices in various trades working around him when he was a young apprentice. He reminisced about a time when there were many opportunities, and he said that the program that they were launching on the Central Coast was in some small way going to make sure that the apprentices who were in the system could complete the training they needed and acquire the skills required for the economy that we have on the Central Coast. We need to give our young people job skills for the future. Without this sort of investment we will find ourselves in a hole in a few years time, with a drastic lack of skills. Such neglect for future needs happened under the previous government and we must not let it happen again. We must be in a position to make sure we continue to train new young people and encourage them to take on further training so that as the economy comes out of the global recession we have the necessary skills to make sure that the economies both locally and on the Central Coast can take advantage of those skills. When the economy recovers we will have in place a better skill base for our young people to help them get ready for the workforce. Setting that up, especially in places such as my electorate, is absolutely vital. On the Central Coast, according to the last available figures, youth unemployment reached around 37 per cent. I am speaking about an area where these types of programs are absolutely essential. We have always had high youth unemployment, but with the global financial crisis we have seen it rise in the last six months from just over 25 per cent to just over 37 per cent. That is why I am supporting the Social Security Amendment (Training Incentives) Bill 2009. It is vital that sort of training be introduced and that these incentives be given so that young people in my area can get a fair shake. The bill introduces a new training supplement to assist low-skill job seekers receiving Newstart allowance or parenting payment to undertake approved training. This will in turn support better employment opportunities for those job seekers. The bill will assist low-skill job seekers with the costs of participating in training or further education which may assist them to secure employment in the future. The bill will encourage more young people to gain the education and skills they need to move into further education or employment, recognising that youth with limited education are particularly vulnerable to becoming unemployed in the long term. The changes will be mirrored in changes to family tax benefit A proposed to commence from January 2010. These changes will proceed separately. Any opportunity for job seekers is vital, especially in regions such as mine, the Central Coast, where young people have constant difficulty in finding work. Not only do we have 37 per cent youth unemployment but 30 per cent of the workforce commute to Sydney every day when they would prefer to work on the Central Coast. This initiative supports the government's commitment to improve the educational attainment level of Australians by encouraging completion of year 12 or equivalent and a commitment to unemployed Australians to provide improved access to education and training opportunities through Job Services Australia and the Productivity Places Program. The training supplement will be available to Newstart allowance and parenting payment recipients who have not completed year 12 or who have a trade or vocational qualification that could be upgraded to better equip them to find future employment. Job seekers this meeting these requirements will receive an extra $41.60 per fortnight if they fully meet the activity test or participation requirements by undertaking approved training or further education at the certificate II or certificate III levels. The training supplement will be available for people commencing approved training between 1 July 2009 and 30 June 2011. The training supplement will be available under any approved training commenced in this period when it is completed. It is estimated that over 50,000 low-skill job seekers will be assisted over this period. The New South Wales Central Coast, as well as having high youth unemployment, has very low school retention rates, well below the benchmarks set at both national and state levels. In fact, less than 50 per cent of people attending school complete year 12. The object of this bill is to encourage young people to remain in education and training until they have completed year 12 or equivalent so they can improve their employment prospects and are equipped to find jobs as the economy improves. These changes support the youth compact and the national youth participation requirements agreed by COAG on 30 April 2009. This measure will also assist in bringing forward the COAG target of 90 per cent year 12 or equivalent attainment from 2020 to 2015. As you can see, on the Central Coast we have a long way to go when we have an under 50 per cent completion level at the moment and want to meet 90 per cent by 2015. It is only by having the government take action in these areas, through bills such as this, that there is some chance of that actually occurring. Youth allowance will be payable to young people without year 12 or an equivalent qualification if they study full time or if they comply with the youth allowance employment pathway plan, which requires 25 hours a week in a combination of part-time study or training, in combination with other approved activities. These requirements will apply until the young person attains year 12 or equivalent certificate level II qualification. Exemptions will apply where no training is reasonably available or the person does not have the capacity to undertake the training that is available. These amendments will apply to new applicants for youth allowance from 1 July 2009. The requirements will be progressively implemented for existing youth allowance recipients without year 12 or the equivalent between January and July 2010. The main points of the bill are the following. The training supplement is an additional, time limited, payment of $41.60 per fortnight to help eligible job seekers who participate in approved study or training. It will be available for courses commenced between 1 July 2009 and 30 June 2011. The government is introducing this payment to encourage and support low-skilled income support recipients with the costs of undertaking training or further education to assist them to secure employment in the future. The training supplement will assist job seekers receiving Newstart allowance or parenting payment who have not completed year 12 or the equivalent or who have a trade or vocational qualification which could be upgraded to better equip them to find future employment. Job seekers will need to participate in approved education or training to receive the training supplement. For some people this may mean full-time study. Others, such as people with a partial capacity to work, would meet their participation requirements through part-time study. The sorts of approved courses that people will need to do include certificate II to certificate III courses which can be approved. Generally courses would run for at least one semester and can be up to 12 months in duration. People wanting to do a course for longer than 12 months may be eligible for student income support payments. The reason why the training supplement is time limited is straightforward enough: the training supplement will be available for two years to provide an enhanced incentive for job seekers to gain skills and qualifications during the global downturn. This makes sure that we do not have a generation that is forgotten because of the global financial crisis. We need to be making sure that not only are we stimulating jobs through the decisive action the government is taking with the stimulus packages but also those young people are being equipped with the skills necessary to participate in the economy as it comes out of recession-that they are not being left on the scrap heap, that they are given the opportunity to train and retrain. Job seekers who participate in the Productivity Places Program will not have to pay for their course. However, not all courses taken up will be provided through the Productivity Places Program. Some may be through a state or territory subsidised TAFE or RTO place. In such cases, normal course fees will apply. As is currently the case, these course costs are the responsibility of the student. In addition to the assistance provided by the fortnightly training supplement, over the period 1 January 2009 to 30 June 2010 recipients of Newstart allowance and parenting payment who undertake approved study or training are also eligible for the education entry payment of $208 and the $950 education entry payment supplement of the Training and Learning Bonus. Looking at the training places, the entitlement to an education or training place is for any government subsidised qualification. Training places will come from a range of existing sources, including the Australian government's Productivity Places Program. This program is providing 711,000 training places over five years to ensure that Australians develop the skills that they and industry need. Of these, 319,000 places, including 20,000 places for workers who may need to be re-skilled, are for job seekers; and 392,000 training places are allocated for existing workers wanting to gain or upgrade their skills. As part of the compact with young Australians, young people under 20 who are working up to 15 hours per week will be eligible for Productivity Places Program training places. For this program to work, some changes will have to be made. From 1 July 2009, young people seeking youth allowance without year 12 or equivalent will be assessed against new participation requirements. Under these new requirements, to receive youth allowance young people under 21 years of age without year 12 or equivalent will need to: participate in education and training full-time; or participate full-timethat is, generally for at least 25 hours a week-in part-time study or training, in combination with other approved activities, until they gain year 12 or all equivalent certificate II qualifications. Young people already receiving youth allowance who do not have year 12 or equivalent qualifications will make the transition to the new requirements between 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2010. It is fair to remind the House why the government is making these changes. Part of the reason is that the changes support the youth compact and national youth participation requirements agreed by COAG on 30 April 2009. Looking closely at these time frames, the changes will apply to all young people without year 12 or an equivalent qualification claiming youth allowance from 1 January 2009 and to existing youth allowance recipients without year 12 or the equivalent who are not full-time students from 1 January 2010. In order to allow young people already receiving youth allowance time to consider their options, the new requirements will be progressively implemented for this group between January 2010 and July 2010. Going over the requirements for young people who obtain year 12 or the equivalent qualification, the existing youth allowance participation requirements will continue for 21-year-olds who have received year 12 or the equivalent qualifications. This group of young people is not affected by the measure. The question has been raised that the new participation measures might punish disadvantaged young people. Past economic downturns have demonstrated that young people with limited education and skills are particularly vulnerable to long-term unemployment. They struggle to find employment even when the economy recovers. The arrangements will be flexible for young people with complex needs. For example, young people with multiple barriers such as homelessness or substance abuse issues who would qualify for stream 4 under Job Services Australia arrangements will meet their requirements by participating in this service stream. Similarly, young people with a partial capacity to work will have their hours of participation tailored to their assessed capacity. If eligible, they can also meet their requirements by participating in disability employment services. The range of existing activity test exemptions based on personal circumstances, such as temporary medical incapacity or major personal crisis, will continue to be available. This will ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to cover periods that young people cannot participate. It is also useful to clear up any concerns about the availability of education or training places. As part of the COAG youth compact, state and territory governments have committed to immediate action to ensure sufficient school and training places are available to young people aged 15 to 19, who will have an entitlement to an education or training place for any government subsidised qualification. This commitment will be fully implemented by 1 July 2009. Enrolments will be subject to admission requirements and course availability. In addition, young people aged 20 to 24 will have an entitlement to an education or training place for any government subsidised qualification which would result in the individual attaining a higher qualification. The commitment to 20-to 24-year-olds will be fully implemented by 1 January 2010. Enrolment will be subject to admission requirements and course availability. State and territory governments will work with their education authorities and training providers to make arrangements for determining eligibility for an entitlement place. It is anticipated that most places will be provided by TAFEs and some by private registered training organisations offering government subsidised qualifications. Commonwealth, state and territory governments will also work with training providers to address issues relating to the provision of places in rural and remote locations. Exemptions will apply in cases where there are no locally accessible training courses or appropriate distance education options. Job Services Australia providers will also have the capacity to help young people gain access to education and training programs to improve their skills, including places in the government's Productivity Places Program. Deputy Speaker Adams, you can see through this bill that the government is committed to helping young people, who might not have the best chances of gaining long-term employment, gain the necessary skills to give them a better chance. It is aimed at those young people who have not completed year 12 or the equivalent, or who have a trade or vocational qualification which could be upgraded to better equip them to find future employment. The budget announcement for this measure stated that the changes to participation requirements for youth allowance are to come into effect on 1 January 2009 for new claimants without year 12 or the equivalent and from 1 January 2010 for existing recipients without year 12 or the equivalent. Budget announcements also stated that the training supplement would commence from 1 July 2009. For young Australians hoping to upgrade their skills-such as from electorates like mine, with 37 per cent youth unemployment and less than 50 per cent of people going on to year 12-the opportunities provided by this legislation cannot be overstated. It is vitally important that there are no delays in this legislation. I commend the bill to the House.",101
132,Mr CLARE ,"Blaxland-Parliamentary Secretary for Employment) (6.30 pm)-I thank all members for their contribution to this debate. The Social Security Amendment (Training Incentives) Bill 2009 is part of the government's strategy to keep Australia working and set us up for the future. It creates new incentives to train and learn, to help young people now and to make sure we have the skills we need as the global economy recovers. Unemployment is the biggest challenge we face. It is the biggest challenge governments face all round the world. In America, unemployment has almost doubled in the last 18 months and now stands at 9.4 per cent-the highest it has been in the last 25 years. Australia is doing better than most. Unemployment is lower here than in any other major advanced economy bar Japan, but there is a tough road ahead. Unemployment is projected to rise. When workers lose their job it does not just hurt the individual and their family, it hurts our economy. We lose skills and experience-the skills and experience that we need to come out the other side of the global recession stronger and more competitive than before. We cannot stop the global recession hitting us, but we can reduce its impact. That is why the government is rolling out 35,000 job sites across the country over the next 12 months, providing tax breaks to small business and introducing this legislation, which is part of the jobs and training compact announced by the Prime Minister in April this year. The bill before us does two things. First, introduces a temporary training supplement. This payment will be made to people who are amongst the most vulnerable to long term unemployment: recipients of Newstart and the parenting payment who have not completed year 12 or an equivalent qualification or those who have a trade qualification that needs to be upgraded. The training supplement of an extra $41.60 a fortnight will be made to Newstart and parenting payment recipients without a year 12 or an equivalent qualification who start an approved course of study or training between 1 July 2009 and 30 June 2011. It is estimated that 50,000 people will benefit from this. Second, the bill changes the participation requirements for youth allowance (other). To obtain youth allowance (other), young people without year 12 or equivalent qualification will now need to participate in education and training. The purpose is to encourage young people to remain in study or training until they complete a basic educational or training qualification-to make sure young people are learning or earning. The logic behind these reforms is simple. Unemployment hits some communities and some groups harder than others. Young people and workers with low skills are particularly vulnerable. Since September last year unemployment amongst young people aged 15 to 24 has grown at a faster rate than it has amongst the rest of the population. The more skills and education people have, the more likely they are to be employed and the more they are likely to be paid. The former Minister for Employment Participation made this point in his second reading speech: By age 24, only seven out of 10 young people without a year 12 or certificate III or IV qualification are in further training or employment. By contrast, nine out of 10 young people with such a qualification are in further training or employment. it In other words, skills count. Qualifications are important. The lesson from the recession of the early nineties is that youth unemployment rises quickly and can take a long time to fall. Then, one in three young people who had not completed year 12 were unemployed. They were three times more likely to be unemployed than someone who had completed year 12. These are the facts. The long-term consequence of this is entrenched disadvantage. Long-term unemployment has a devastating impact on individuals and on families. It also has a long term impact on the productivity and competitiveness of our economy. That is why this bill is important. It is part of a comprehensive strategy to reduce the risk of long-term unemployment and build the skills that we need to compete in a world beyond the global recession; to keep Australia working. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading",105
133,Mr CLARE ,"Blaxland-Parliamentary Secretary for Employment) (6.35 pm)-by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (IMPROVED SUPPORT FOR CARERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL) BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 27 May, on motion by Ms Macklin: That this bill be now read a second time.",107
134,Mr ABBOTT ,"Warringah) (6.35 pm)-I do not intend to detain the House long at all on this bill because the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Improved Support for Carers) (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2009 is about as uncontroversial as a piece of legislation can be. That does not necessarily mean that there will not be any contention in the House, but I am fairly confident that the contention will be over other aspects of social security policy, not about the particular provisions of this bill. Essentially what this bill does is change the criterion for carers to go on the carer payment from one determined by medical classification to one determined by the actual level of care provided. As well, it changes the terminology of disability to something more appropriate and more sensitive to the modern ear. It is essentially housekeeping. It will benefit many thousands of people over time, as the costings reflect. The opposition support this bill and we commend it to the House.",107
135,Ms ANNETTE ELLIS ,"Canberra) (6.37 pm)-It is indeed a pleasure to rise this evening to speak in support of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Improved Support for Carers) (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2009. As has probably been said by other members, the earlier bill, the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Improved Support for Carers) Bill 2009, provides part of the government's response to the report of the Carer Payment (child) Review Taskforce. It gives effect to a number of measures aimed at improving assistance to carers from 1 July this year. The bill we are debating tonight is the companion bill to the improved support for carers bill, which has passed through the House already. This bill now comes in, as the previous speaker said, to put into effect most of the provisions required for carers in this area. I am really very pleased to see this happening and to be part of the clarification process in the parliament tonight. As most members will be aware, a committee I chair recently provided a report to the parliament on the role of carers in our society. Through that process we had the opportunity-and the privilege, I might add-to speak and listen to literally hundreds and hundreds of carers around the country. We had the opportunity to hear precisely what they had to say about their lives, the impact of the caring role on their lives and the sorts of things that they saw as important in attempting to lighten the load or to make their journey through their life of caring a little bit more bearable and manageable. Many of the things that are in this bill answer some of those questions and will make things a lot better for many carers. For instance, the amendments will include the removal of references in social security law which, from 1 July this year, will be redundant and the replacement of those references with the new terms necessary for the proper administration of the changes to be introduced. There are a couple of things I would like to mention briefly, if I may, which really will have a great effect on the day-today lives of these people. One of them is the 63-day rule. Amendments made by this bill will provide that carers who qualify for the carer payment under the new qualification provisions will be able to take advantage of the existing benefits for carers. For example, under the 63-day rule, carers can temporarily cease to provide constant care but remain qualified for the carer payment. What this new provision will mean is that, if you are in a caring role and the person for whom you are caring has a period in hospital or a period of respite care for up to 63 days per annum, the carer payment will continue to be made. That makes life a whole heap easier. The cost of caring does not necessarily dissolve into nothing just because the person you are offering that care to is not literally in your house or under your care. As I said, they could be in hospital or respite care or a similar type of arrangement. I think this is a really sensible provision and will be very welcome for a number of people out there. One of the other provisions is the special backdating for the carer payment. Given that this is a new regime, a new order of things, and knowing the frantic lives that these people lead, it may take a little while for some them to access the new forms and the new transitional arrangements. Between 1 July and 1 October this year, if there is evidence in an application from a treating health professional indicating that the carer would have been qualified for the payment within that period-had they known that they could in fact have made that application or had they had the time to make the application-the application can be backdated, as a transitional arrangement under the new rules. So between 1 July and 1 October this year there is a little bit of flexibility, given the right circumstances, for the carer in question to be accommodated through the application process, should that be required. Again, that makes it just that bit easier for these people and offers some understanding of the types of situations that they find themselves in and the pressures that we all know they face. I do not know how other members feel, but I know that in my own life sometimes I can be very busy. Sometimes paperwork flows through your letterbox and you are not really sure how quickly you will be able to look at it. If you are in a caring role, I tell you, it can be all the more difficult. It is hard enough in normal life, let alone in those sorts of circumstances. I am really very pleased to see that we are now progressing. As I said, the original bill has gone through the House, and I believe it is now in the other place. We now have this machinery piece of legislation which will put into place the provisions that were alluded to in the earlier bill. This bill makes them all technically possible. I am very, very happy to think that we are going to see this happen, that we are going to see the progress brought about by these legislative changes. I have only mentioned a couple of them in brief, but I know that for the carers that we have spoken to through our inquiry process and the people that we all know in our constituencies of this is really going to make a difference. That is what we are all here for, I believe, as parliamentarians. In cases like this we can actually make a practical difference to the lives of people who really need assistance. So I welcome this bill. As technical as it may be in some cases, it will put into action the provisions of the previous piece of legislation. Importantly, it builds on the work of the Carer Payment (child) Review Taskforce, which set this in train in the first place. I am proud to be a member of the government that set that up. I am proud that we are now seeing the provisions come in and that the benefits will flow through to those who have caring roles in our community. I welcome this legislation into the House.",107
136,Ms LEY ,"Farrer) (6.44 pm)-Like the previous two speakers, I welcome the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Improved Support for Carers) (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2009. It is insignificant and technical in itself, but it is part of a very important range of measures that will make life easier for carers. As our opposition spokesman said a few moments ago, there would be few less contentious pieces of legislation to go through the House. So, of course, we in the opposition welcome the measures in this bill and the changes that they will help bring to the lives of carers. I was privileged to be part of the Standing Committee on Family, Community, Housing and Youth for a short while last year and to commence work on the inquiry that was tabled recently. I recognise the previous speaker, the member for Canberra, for her chairmanship of that inquiry. The report was called Who cares…? It really puts so much of what carers feel, believe and passionately want into words. It was a privilege to be part of that committee. As members of parliament, every day we hear and see the results of people struggling with the caring role. I just want to touch on a couple of the special moments for me as part of that committee and the moments that encouraged me to work harder for carers. They were the representations made by young carers-those who are children struggling with school or in some cases young people at university and who are actually the carers in their family. One particular young lady said: … I have been caring for my father since I was 12 years old and he retired. Over those years I did not have any support. It was not until the start this year that I found community options. So for seven years I was doing it on my own and attending high school. It was not actually until I started university-and I am doing psychology-that I realised that dad could have a mental illness. I went to his GP and I said, ‘Dad could have depression'. I was told that, because I do not have a medical degree, I did not know what I was talking about. So for six months dad went undiagnosed. Subsequently he took himself to hospital with suicidal thoughts. That was a big shock to me personally. For 12 months dad did not have any treatment. I just want to say that, because of that, I would really like GPs to consider that carers are a big part of the lives of the people they look after. I do not read that third-party quote to criticise GPs at all, but simply to say that the issue of carers and those that they look after is a community-wide issue and everybody involved needs to be aware of this. All carers that come to see me in my office without question, apart from being exhausted, talk about their responsibility. They talk about the positives as well; it is not all negative. They have such low expectations and they feel this is a burden that they have to carry very much on their own. If every other chain in the process-including GPs, advocates, workmates and everybody involved-recognised the enormous load that the caring role places on individuals and offered a bit of support here and there, it would make an enormous difference. One of the other things that came out of my work on this committee was a forum we held in my home town of Albury where people stood up and for a few minutes gave a snapshot of their lives and the caring role. One member of the committee-I actually cannot remember who it was-said, ‘You all seem so calm,' and one particular woman said, ‘That is because we are all so medicated.' It really struck me that in order to get through the day a lot of carers are themselves of quite understandably struggling with their own health issues. They really do need support. Without making this a political statement, in New South Wales we do certainly notice a lot less support than the government just across the border to the south gives to its carers and their families. With the New South Wales budget on its way tomorrow, I really do hope that further support for this important area is maintained. It needs to be increased, because along the border-and my electorate is on the border-between New South Wales and Victoria the frank advice that people are receiving in New South Wales is to take their family to Victoria where the state government actually does a lot more for their children in school and gives them the respite that they desperately need. Respite is an enormous issue for everybody-and I am sure this is common across the board. For people under 18, there are day programs and places for people to go with their disabilities and have special ment. That is catered for reasonably well. The problem arises for families when their young person turns 18, is no longer entitled to the same level of support or the support changes and-more importantly-the facilities are not there in the community. Just because somebody has a disability does not mean they want to live at home when they turn 18 and become a young adult. They still need to make their own way in the world and they need that level of independence. There is nowhere which supports them, which allows them their independence, which gives their family that much needed ongoing respite and which keeps them safe and looks after them. I do hope that we as a parliament focus more attention on the needs of carers and that we look at the needs of those young adults. Good things have been done for autism and packages have been put together, and they have made a difference for young people. There is early intervention at school, which is a critical time in a young person's life, but at the moment I am really detecting that some support for young adults with disabilities at the stage of life where they do want to gain some independence is simply not out there. I conclude by thanking those on all sides of the parliament who work hard for those carers in their electorate. I encourage each and every one of them to continue to support them in whatever way they can.",109
137,Mr TREVOR ,"Flynn) (6.50 pm)-I rise to support the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Improved Support for Carers) (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2009. As you will be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, the measures in this bill are part of a 2008 budget measure of which the legislative component has financial impacts as follows. The total resourcing of all portfolios for the 2008-09 year is $15.5 million; in 2009-10, $72.8 million; in 2010-11, $89.9 million; and treatin 2011-12, $93.3 million. Pursuant to schedule 1, ‘Amendment of the Social Security Act 1991', from 1 July this year a person will be able to qualify for carer payment if one of the following circumstances apply: (a) care is provided to a child with a severe disability or severe medical condition; (b) care is provided to two or more children each with a disability or medical condition; (c) care is provided to a disabled adult and one or more children, each with a disability or medical condition; (d) care is provided to a child who has a terminal condition; (e) the care of two or more children each with a severe disability or severe medical condition is exchanged between the separated or divorced parents of the children; (f) care is provided to a child or children on a short-term or episodic basis; (g) care is provided to a disabled adult or a disabled adult and a dependent child; or (h) care is provided to any of the above while they are in hospital. The qualification provisions for carer payment where care is provided to a child with a severe disability or severe medical condition, or care is provided to two or more children each with disability or medical condition, or care is provided to a child with a terminal condition, replace the current qualification provisions for care provided to a profoundly disabled child or two or more disabled children. Qualification for care provided to a disabled adult and one or more children each with a disability or medical condition is a new qualification provision that is additional to the current qualification provision for care provided to a disabled adult and a dependent child of the disabled adult. This schedule repeals references to the terms ‘profoundly disabled child' and ‘disabled child' where the use of the terms are associated with carer payment from the Social Security Act. These terms are replaced with terminology related to the new qualification provisions inserted by the improved support for carers bill. The amendments contained in this schedule ensure that provisions contained in the Social Security Act, such as the care receiver's income and assets tests, will apply to a person who makes a claim for carer payment after the commencement of the improved support for carers bill. Amendments are also made to special benefit provisions to ensure that the improved qualification criteria for carer payment is reflected in the relief from the ity test that is applied to people who are not residentially qualified for carer payment. This schedule also makes amendments so that a person who is qualified for carer payment for care provided on a short-term or episodic basis is not qualified for a pensioner concession card but is qualified for a healthcare card. Finally, the provisions that relate to who can be the principal beneficiary of a special disability trust are amended in line with the improved qualification criteria for carer payment. The Rudd Labor government is committed to improving significantly the level of assistance for carers of children with disability or severe medical conditions. This bill delivers on that commitment. The changes in this bill are the latest in a series of recent support initiatives that have been extended to carers. The 2008 one-off payment legislation delivered $1,000 to carer payment recipients and certain other pensioners with a caring role, and carer allowance recipients were, generally, paid some $600 for each person cared for. Then the Economic Security Strategy legislation of late 2008 provided some $1,400 to carer payment recipients and, generally, $1,000 to carer allowance recipients for each person cared for. These new budget measures are part of an $822 million package from the 2008 budget to support and recognise carers. The amendments will deliver a new, fairer set of qualification criteria for carer payment paid in respect of a child based on the level of care required rather than the rigid medical criteria currently used to assess qualification for the payment. Estimates are that some 19,000 more carers will have access to carer payment from 1 July 2009. As at January 2009 there were 2,795 carer allowance recipients and 941 carer payment recipients in my electorate of Flynn. The 2006 census recorded for my electorate of activFlynn 4,562 people in need of assistance. That is the number of people with a profound or severe disability. People with a profound or severe disability are defined as needing help or assistance in one or more of the three core activity areas of self-care, mobility and communication. The 2006 census also recorded over 9,000 people in my electorate of Flynn who in the two weeks prior to census night spent time providing unpaid care, help or assistance to family members or others because of a disability, a long-term illness problems relating to old age. As the father of a son with a disability who cannot live without a life-sustaining medication I congratulate these wonderful people for their efforts. I sincerely hope that this legislation goes a long way to rewarding them for their efforts. I commend this bill wholeheartedly, from the bottom of my heart, to this House.",110
138,Mrs MOYLAN ,"Pearce) (6.58 pm)Being able to address matters in relation to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Improved Support for Carers) (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2009 is a great portunity to speak on behalf of all those ple who undertake the important role of caring within our community. These changes to legislation will certainly impact on a great number of people who care for others and, in particular, for children who have special care needs. The bill proposes to move from focusing on a child's actual medical condition to focusing on care requirements, and this is consistent with the application of care requirements for qualification for carer allowance. The new Disability Care Load Assessment (Child) Determination, to be introduced by this bill, is intended to provide an objective tool for assessing the care requirements of care recipients. Assessing care requirements in relation to children is complicated by the fact that all children need a certain level of care appropriate to their age and level of turity. However, children with severe illness or those recovering from an accident may need considerable extra care. Despite the broadening in 2006 of eligibility for carer payments to carers of children with severe intellectual, psychiatric or behavioural disabilities requiring constant care or supervision, it became apparent that, in fact, few families qualified for the carer or payment. Although there were 113,549 carers receiving carer allowance to assist them with costs involved in caring for a child with a disability in June 2008, the narrow criteria meant that in practice only 7,000 children were being cared for by people receiving the carer payment, so there has been an obvious disconnect due to the tight eligibility criteria. A recent report following an inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family, Community, Housing and Youth, of which I am deputy chair, highlighted the great hardship encountered by many carers, who felt that they were not beoping adequately supported in the caring role. peo- The Who cares …? report made it clear that there were common concerns amongst carers regardless of what kind of caring role they undertook. They were united by the challenge they faced, and it became abundantly clear that insufficient attention was being paid to caring for the needs of carers. One of those needs is to simplify the maze of bureaucratic red tape and the hoops that carers must jump through to access support. No group could be more worthy of clearing a more certain path than those caring for children with a serious illness or disability. The care requirements for carer allowance are far less rigorous than the care requirement for carer payment, and the care requirements for carer payment for a person caring for an adult are also less rigorous than the care requirements for caring for a child. ma- The differential was explained away by an assumption that all parents of young children engage in the caring role. However, the assumption did not take into account the additional care responsibilities of those parents who care for children who have a disability or severe medical condition. In an endeavour to rectify this, in 2007 the Howard government introduced a carer adjustment payment of up to $10,000. The carer adjustment payment was available where a family had a child aged up to six years who was diagnosed with a major disability due to an accidental injury or a severe illness. Carer adjustment payment was an interim payment available while the review of carer payment for carers of children with a medical condition was being conducted. It was to terminate on 30 June 2008, but funding was provided in the 2008 budget for carer adjustment payment to continue to be available past that date. A review task force headed by Anthony Blunn was established in March 2007 to examine the effectiveness of carer payment as a safety net for carers of children with profound disabilities or severe medical conditions. The terms of reference recognised that a carer payment is an income support payment for carers who, because of the demands of their caring role, are unable to support themselves through substantial participation in the workforce. The report of the review, released in early 2008, concluded that carer payment did not provide the intended safety net and recommended changes that are now the subject of this bill. Some of the 32 recommendations in the Blunn review were changes to eligibility requirements and a new assessment process to recognise the level of care required by the care receiver and provided by the carer; better support for carers through improved service delivery, including case coordination and more accessible information about payments; increased support for carers to participate in the workforce through improved access to the Job Network, help with childcare arrangements and assistance for employers; and increased recognition for carers through carer recognition legislation and a national action plan for carers. It is interestability, ing to note that there have been many inquiries into and reviews of this issue over the years, and in every case they have come up with very similar conclusions. More recently, the bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. A submission was made to that committee by the Disability Services Commission of Western Australia, which was very positive about the benefits of the changes that we are discussing tonight and the way in which they would make for better support for carers. The Director-General of the Disability Services Commission of Western Australia, Dr Ron Chalmers, commented specifically on the bill's ability to ease the financial hardship for carers. As I said earlier, few people are eligible for the carer payment in its current form. The changes outlined in this bill will ensure that a further 19,000 carers of children will now qualify for a carer payment. This is a very welcome change indeed. The bill changes the way eligibility is assessed for carer payment for those caring for a child. Currently eligibility is based, as I said, on a child's disability or medical condition. The new methodology for assessing eligibility will be through the disallowable legislative instrument referred to previously, called the Disability Care Load Assessment (Child) Determination. Instead of focusing solely on a child's medical condition, this takes into account the care needs and is consistent with the way in which applications are assessed for carer allowance. It is also pleasing to see for the first time access to carer payment for a carer caring for a child up to the age of 16 who has a short-term or episodic illness. This may include mental illness conditions or medical conditions such as cancer and the many other illnesses that often beset children. This new instrument for determining eligibility will provide a test for assessing the functional behaviour and special care needs of a child. That includes a section to be completed by a treating health professional, a method of rating the child's care needs and method of providing a qualifying rating for the carer that takes account of the care vided by the carer and the assessment, again, of the health professional. Item 10 of this bill inserts new sections along with changes to existing sections. It sets out the criteria for qualification for a carer payment, and it includes some new items. Some of these are: a child with a severe disability or medical condition; two or more children, each with a disability or medical condition; a disabled adult and one or more children, each with a disability or medical condition; a child who has a terminal condition; exchange care of children; short-term, episodic care of children; extenderstand sion of short-term or episodic care of children; disabled adult or disabled adult and dependent child; hospitalisation; and some short-term circumstances. In order to qualify for these payments, the carer must provide constant care to a care receiver who has high care needs, provide that care in the home of the care receiver and be an Australian resident. This section has not changed. However, there are new sections that take into account the impact of caring on a person's ability undertake training, education, unpaid voluntary work or paid employment. Limitations are currently in place on the number of hours a carer can work before they cease to provide constant care for the purpose of receiving carer payment. I think one of the toughest hurdles for carers is need to make a choice between continuing to work in the paid workforce and the need to give full-time care. So often, the care are such that continuing to work in the paid workforce, even on a part-time basis, is ply not a choice at all. And the limited options for carers to participate in the paid workforce are further exacerbated by the severe shortage of places in day-care facilithen ties or carers who can come into the home to a relieve the principal carer. These are issues that I think need further airing and further procommunity discussion. Financial hardship is a major ongoing concern for many carers and the Who cares …? report actually recommends a significant increase in the base rate of carer payment. We have also asked that the Treasurer consider easing the tax burden on carers. The financial support received by carers can be quickly consumed by specialist medical services, medication and/or equipment required by those they care for-for example, buying a wheelchair, adapting a house and the myriad other additional costs that carers must fund. They soon add up, and it is easy to unhow rapidly financial stress can build up in families who find themselves in these circumstances. Financial isolation of carers is further exacerbated by employment limitations. Currently, there are significant disincentives for carers to earn supplementary income because any additional income reduces quite sharply the amount of income support they receive. Carers should be able to look to the future with at least some degree of certainty and to maintain a reasonable standard of living, and this bill does go one step closer to providing greater certainty and better support. In conclusion, the changes outlined in this bill will be very welcome to those caring for children with a disability or severe illness. However, the whole issue of how we supthe port, value and treat our carers will need much more attention in the future. Many of the issues raised in the 2007 task force report needs commissioned by the Howard government are again canvassed in the latest report, Who simcares …? As I said in my speech to the House during the tabling of that report, if we are to answer, ‘We care'-that is, those of us in this place responsible for the legislationwe need to confront the issues facing carers head on and match the rhetoric with reality. It will need all the political will we can muster to ensure a better future for carers and those they care for, just as this legislation will assist many in the community who provide extra care to children. I welcome the measures that are outlined in this bill. The changes recommended in the task force report will make a difference to the lives of carers now and into the future; in the meantime, these incremental changes are very welcome.",112
139,Ms MACKLIN ,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (7.11 pm)-in replyFirst of all, I thank all the members for their contributions to this important debate. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Improved Support for Carers) Bill 2009 provides part of the government's response to the report of the Carer Payment (child) Review Taskforce, and gives effect to a number of measures aimed at improving assistance to carers from 1 July 2009. The improved support for carers bill will extend qualification for carer payment to around 19,000 more carers from 1 July 2009 by delivering a new, fairer set of qualification criteria for carer payment paid in respect of a child, based on the level of care required rather than the medical criteria currently used to assess qualification for the payment. This bill, the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Improved Support for Carers) (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2009, makes amendments as a consequence of the measures contained in the improved support for carers bill. This companion bill makes minor amendments of a consequential and transitional nature. The amendments made by this bill include removal of references in the social security law that from 1 July 2009 will be redundant, and replaces those references with new terms and references necessary for the proper administration of the changes introduced in the improved support for carers bill. Amendments made by this bill will provide that carers who qualify for carer payment under the new qualification provisions will be able to take advantage of the 63 days, or the pro rata equivalent, for carers qualified on a short-term or episodic basis on which carers can temporarily cease to provide constant care and remain qualified for carer payment. This bill provides that nominated visa holders who cannot qualify for carer payment as they do not meet the residency requirement can be granted an exemption from the activity test in relation to special benefit if they are providing care to a child or children who meet the criteria contained in the new qualification provisions. The bill also amends the provisions that relate to the nomination of the principal beneficiary of a special disability trust under the Social Security Act 1991 or the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to reflect the changes made by the introduction of the improved qualification criteria for carer payments. Lastly, the bill also provides for the backdating of carer payment for people who qualrigid ify for carer payment under one of the new qualification provisions. A person who makes an application before 1 October 2009 will be able to have their carer payment backdated to the date they became qualified for carer payment. The earliest date at which they can become qualified is the date of implementation of the new qualification provision, which is 1 July 2009. We look forward to these provisions becoming law to support carers doing a very important job in our community, caring for children who have very serious illnesses. Question agreed to.

Bill read a third time. SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIAN APPRENTICES) Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 May, on motion by Ms Gillard: That this bill be now read a second time.",116
141,Dr SOUTHCOTT ,"Boothby) (7.16 pm)-I will not detain the House long in speaking to the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Australian Apprentices) Bill 2009. This bill seeks to exempt incentives paid to apprentices from treatment as assessable income for taxation, social security and veterans affairs purposes. These amendments will ensure that apprentices retain the entire amount of the financial incentives paid to them. This will bring these new payments into line with the tax treatment afforded to previous incentives. It is a sensible measure that the opposition support. The first of these payments is the Skills for Sustainability for Australian Apprentices. This is a pilot program aimed at encouraging apprentices to undertake sustainability related training, by granting a payment of $1,000 on completion of a required level of training. Discussions about sustainability related training have been around in this space for some time. We welcome this pilot program and we will be interested to see how it develops. The second payment is a rebadged payment called the Tools for Your Trade incentive. In fact, it is not even rebadged, because the old incentive was also called Tools for Your Trade. This measure will combine three existing incentives into one. Whilst the opposition will be supporting the bill, we do have a couple of issues here. First of all, the new incentive is not set to be payable until 1 January 2010, and there is an issue for apprentices and trainees who commence between 12 May 2009-that is, budget dayand 1 January 2010. There is a real question as to whether those people will be eligible BILL 2009 for the Tools for Your Trade incentive or whether they will fall through the gap in the merging of these three programs. So we do have an issue in that, in moving from the old Tools for Your Trade to a newer, simplified incentive, a cohort of apprentices will miss out. The second issue is that a detailed examination of the budget papers reveals a pea and thimble trick in the incentives being paid to apprentices. Incredibly, at a time when the Australian economy needs to support employers, apprentices and people staying in their apprenticeships, the Rudd government is taking a net $197 million out of the pockets of apprentices. This is classic sleight of hand: a number of things are going. The biggest one is the apprenticeship training fee voucher. Labor had a policy to fund $800 for out-of-pocket payments, which they announced in December 2006. They have not stuck by that, and in fact they have abolished the apprenticeship training fee voucher, which was introduced in the 2007 budget. In their 2007 election policy document Skilling Australia for the future the Labor Party promised that all subsidies and payments to employers and apprentices would be retained. When you look at the fine print in the budget, you can see that this is not extra money for apprentices. In the middle of what is leading to $188 billion in net debt and $315 billion in gross debt you can see that they have taken $197 million out of the pockets of apprentices. When we have a look at the latest figures from the NCVER on apprenticeships and trainees-and bear in mind that these figures are six months behind-we see that between the March 2008 quarter and the December 2008 quarter apprenticeship commencements in traditional trades fell by 10 per cent. That is really before a lot of the impact came from the slowdown in the economy. As we have heard, at the same time that we are seeing commencements falling the Rudd Labor government has abolished the apprenticeship training fee vouchers, which provided up to $1,000 to apprentices to help pay for their training. As I said, apprentices who commence after 12 May 2009 will not have access to the Tools for Your Trade funding because this has been put on hold until 1 January 2010. The opposition have been vocal in their support for small business and apprentices during this economic downturn. As one example of this, during the leader of the opposition's budget reply, we put up a proposal to bring forward the incentives for employers for traditional trades into the first two years of the apprenticeship. As the OECD noted in its review of vocational education and training in Australia and policy relating to it, most of the incentives for employers are actually back-ended towards the end of an apprenticeship. We believe that it makes sense to bring them forward to a time in those first couple of years when the apprentice is not as productive and when the cost of hiring them is something that all businesses will take into account. Bringing forward those incentives for employers will also help to boost cash flows at a time when employers need this assistance most. The bill is a modest proposal designed to help employers retain their apprentices and take on new apprentices, especially apprentices whose employment is in jeopardy. It provides a very good example of how a modest, targeted proposal can be more effective than massive waves of extravagant cash splash-the $22 billion in cash splash, the $42 billion in economic stimulus and other examples. The opposition will be supporting this legislation. We are disappointed that the Rudd government have taken $197 million from the pockets of apprentices. We are also disappointed that they were not able to time it a bit better. It seems that apprentices who commence between 12 May 2009 and 1 January 2010 will miss out on the government's Tools for Your Trade incentive, but we do support exempting these new incentives as assessable income for taxation.",116
142,Mr HAYES ,"Werriwa) (7.24 pm)-The government is unapologetic when it comes to investing in nation building and investing in education and training. An investment in nation building through what we are doing in the development of infrastructure is just as important as what we are doing not only in the development of our skills now but also in our requirements for the future. Therefore, the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Australian Apprentices) Bill 2009 takes certain very positive steps in relation to apprentices, particularly incentives for apprentices to remain in their apprenticeships through to completion with a view to plying their trade productively and comprehensively in our communities into the future. We on this side of the House are committed to supporting jobs. No-one could challenge us on that, despite the fact that people on the other side of the House want to make mild protestations when it comes to our spending on targeting jobs. But, when it came down to it, I also saw the rush of people from the other side who wanted to get their faces on the camera in association with our investment in schools or what we are doing with social housing. The Minister for Housing, Ms Plibersek, who is at the table at the moment, accompanied me in my own electorate, where we are doing significant things with housing. As a matter of fact, in my electorate, which has a very high proportion of social housing, over $16 million has been allocated not to the construction of new premises but to the refurbishment of existing stock. One of the really decent things occurring out there at this stage is the partnerships are emerging. In a recent program targeted at Macquarie Fields, one of the contractors that won social housing contracts is involved in a partnership to train people. Around $154,000 is going to go towards helping kids from challenged backgrounds to become involved with working in the construction industry and to ascertain whether they want to stay there, with a view to leading them into trade apprenticeships in the building and construction area. That is a wonderful thing to do. It is targeted at a group that may be at risk of falling through the cracks. This is something that this government are doing. Whilst we are investing in creating jobs, we are not taking our eye off the ball when it comes to looking into the future and looking at the skills that we can develop in all these kids into the future. That is why this bill is importraining tant. As I said at the outset, this is about taining young people primarily when they embark on an apprenticeship. Far too often, unfortunately, people start these things and then let them go. There are many reasons for that, I guess, but one of the things that this bill addresses is to put the incentive in there for targeted young people to complete their training and to fulfil the terms of their apprenticeships. This government are investing in a range of things. We are certainly investing heavily in roads in my electorate. I know that others are heavily committed to ports and rail, but what we are doing through the school modernisation project, what we are doing in our local hospital and what we are doing in social housing are very major investments. In undertaking these investments, we are also investing in the skills development of our people. From the opposition's perspective, after their 12 years in government it all got a bit hard to some extent for them. Mr Deputy Speaker, you might recall that when the Howard government came to power they that took money out of the education system. We found ourselves, after having about a billion dollars stripped out of education and while it was raining bars of gold, as the saying goes, in a position where we did not have the tradespeople to work in our mines, to move our coal and to export our iron ore. As a matter of fact, one of my young sons found himself working for a period of time in Blackwater and then in Port Hedlandmaking significant amounts of money I might add, in the process. But one of the problems there was that people were required to come in on short-term overseas visas to provide the skills necessary for the productivity of the industries. That is an indictment of the planning that took place. It is an indictment of those responsible, who allowed this to occur by not overseeing the of our young people to ensure that rewe had an adequate supply of apprentices moving through the system and therefore we had the tradespeople with the necessary skills necessary for the productivity those industries provide which contribute to the growth of this country. To that end, the Deputy Prime Minister has only recently indicated that in terms of the tendering processes for the federal government and its infrastructure projects, preference is being given to businesses that can demonstrate a commitment to training and employment of apprentices and trainees. As I indicated a little while earlier in terms of social housing, that is precisely what the principal contractor is doing for those projects in my electorate of Werriwa, particularly in areas of Claymore, Minto and Macquarie Fields. Young people are being trained in those areas. As a matter of fact, it was very heartening the other day for me to be with the head of the South West Sydney Institute of TAFE, Mr Barry Peddle, who came to see me about the $10 million that the federal government has now allocated for a new building skills centre in Ingleburn. This new centre will be used for training young people in building and construction. Part of the reason for my electorate being the recipient of that funding-hopefully it had something to do with some fruitful lobbying-was that where I live is the growth centre for Sydney. The south-west is where the next wave of development will occur. One of the things that follow from that will be a boom in housing and construction to facilitate the development. At the moment we do not have the number of tradespeople necessary to facilitate that. That is what this investment of $10 million is designed to do. It is to help provide those apprentices in the industries necessary to accommodate the south-west growth centre of Sydney. That is something that we, in my neck of the woods, have a vested interest in. It will certainly give young people the opportunity to pursue their desires, talents and skills in that tion. To some extent I will continue my speech with my personal involvement in apprenticeships. Whilst my daughter went on to university and became a high school teacher, both my sons decided that university was not for them. One of the boys became a buildercarpenter and the other boy-after an apprenticeship through the National Electrical the Contractors Association, a group training body-became an electrician. That has opened up a whole range of opportunities for them over the years. To some extent one of the boys has moved in and out of his calling, but because he successfully completed an apprenticeship he always had something to fall back on. As the boys describe it, they go ‘back on tools'. That is pretty helpful. My other son, the electrician, has been around. He is the fella who has been to Port Hedland and Blackwater and worked in the mines and done all those things. He has come back and, because of the stimulus package, he is now doing work locally for the first time ever, as he has put it to me. He is working locally refurbishing Housing NSW stock in our local area. He set up his own little private company and he is out there subbing and doing all those sorts of things. So, good luck to them! But it is not just my boys-I am talking about my direct experience-I know their friends are out there doing similar things. As a matter of fact, about nine weeks ago I held a forum in my electorate. I invited all the businesses, through the chambers of commerce et cetera to find those who had an interest in picking up work that could possibly flow from the stimulus package targeted at education-the schools projects-and social housing. In my electorate, which is in outermetropolitan Sydney, I can report to you that we had 220 people turn up from local busidirecnesses, wanting to know how they could express their interest in being involved in these matters. One of the key things I discovered when listening to a number of the people there was that they wanted some indication of how the tendering process would operate. They wanted to know what skills they would need. A few of them wanted to know how many apprentices they would need to put on. Another one wanted to know where the apprentices would undertake that training, because they wanted the apprentices working at the moment. They were pretty heartened to hear about the establishment of the new TAFE facility in Ingleburn. It will target, ostensibly, the building and construction trades. That is certainly going to help the numbers of young people coming into this industry. It was important for those people who attended my forum to learn, with some surety, about the numbers of jobs that are likely to be created. I know that an electorate office out there should not become an employment facility but my office has been inundated with people ringing up and wanting to know how to get their names on the list and how to express an interest in jobs. We refer them to Housing NSW and to the New South Wales Department of Education and Training. There is now an endless stream of people who are trying to get involved-from established companies through to people such as my young fella who wants to set up his own business so that he can participate in the jobs created by this round of stimulus package activity. And that sort of thing is occurring, would say, in every electorate. Another of our very successful businesses in Ingleburn is Broens engineering. I knew Carlos Broens when he started this company as a toolmaker. He and his brother were the whole business. It now employs around 300 people. In outer metropolitan Sydney, that is a large employer. Last year, he took on 34 apprentices. He actually has a TAFE facility on his site now so that young apprentices can be trained with the equipment the business uses. He has been preselected, I understand, for contracts for Boeing, and he is doing work for BMW, GMH and Mercedes. This is a success story of our area. From the back blocks of Sydney, he is now exporting to world markets. His site certainly has significant engineering credibility. What Carlos always maintains, and what distinguishes his approach, is his commitment to training. He spearheaded Austool, a body which attracted some government funds, with a view to targeting skills development in the toolmaking sector. Unfortunately, that scheme did not go all that well, and he became discouraged with the process. That was when he started TAFE visiting his premises-they are now working from his premises. He has been instrumental in TAFE reinjecting itself in Ingleburn-which is a growing industrial estate of the south-west of Sydney-with a view to targeting young apprentices there and providing opportunities for employers. Young people are able to be trained locally as opposed to having to be carted off to the various TAFE colleges depending on their specialties. We are now seeing opportunities for companies to work in conjunction, hand in hand, with some of these skills providers. The use that is now being made of TAFE, and TAFE facilities working in partnership with the individual to deliver these trade developments, is now paying significant dividends throughout the I industrial areas of my electorate. This bill will do a number of things which will support young people in their trades. It will certainly support retention of apprentices. The bill will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to exempt the value of payments made under the Skills for Sustainability for Australian Apprentices and Tools For Your Trade, under the Australian Apprenticeships Incentives Program, from treatment as assessable income for income tax purposes and from the income test for benefits under social security and veterans' affairs legislation. Skills for Sustainability for Australian Apprentices is a pilot program within the Skills for the Carbon Challenge initiative. This initiative came out of the 2020 Summit and aims to accelerate the response to climate change by industry and the tertiary education sector. To encourage apprenticeships to undertake sustainability related training, the payment of $1,000 will be provided to eligible apprentices who have successfully completed the required level of training to provide them with skills in sustainability and environmentally sustainable work practices. The enhanced Tools For Your Trade payment combines and extends three existing support initiatives-the Tools For Your Trade voucher, the apprenticeship wage top-up and the Commonwealth trade learning scholarship-in the one new Tools For Your Trade payment under the Australian Apprenticeships Incentives Program. The new payment comprises five separate cash payments totalling $3,800 paid over the life of the apprenticeship to apprentices in selected trade occupations, agricultural occupations and, if in rural and regional locations, horticultural occupations. The new arrangements, importantly, reduce the administrative burden for employers of apprentices, broaden eligibility criteria, benefiting more apprentices, and ensure that apprentices in skills shortage trades are gible for the same level of government support regardless of age and employer size. The amendments in the bill will ensure that ble apprentices receive the full benefit payments made under the two new programs and are consistent with the tax treatment of previous programs that have paid personal benefits to apprentices. I welcome these measures as they apply through my electorate. I will always play a role in advocating proper and sustainable trade based training. It is something that we as a nation have prided ourselves on in the past and it is something that over the past 10 or 12 years we have allowed to escape. If we are serious about building our economy for the future, this is something we need to keep our eye on. I welcome this. I think it is good for young people. It is a great measure to encourage the retention of apprentices and it is very good for businesses such as Broens engineering. This is what we can do as a nation. It is important that we give suitable attention to trade based training and trade development. It worked very effectively for my young fellas. As I said, they have all been able to go on and do a range of different jobs, but at some stage when it suits them they return the tools. These are skills that they will maintain for life. Their skills passport will enable them to participate in building our economy in the future.",117
143,Mr TUCKEY ,"O'Connor) (7.44 pm)On the face of it, the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Australian Apprentices) Bill 2009 is of a fairly minor nature but is of an administrative type and consequently brings together certain payments. As frequently occurs over time, governments make a variety of initiatives and it becomes obvious that they should be amalgamated into a single grant or whatever. It eli- also, I am pleased to say, makes sure that such grants as are given in these circumstances are not subject to the income tax that eligi- would otherwise apply to the income of of the young people, apprentices and others. I should not use the words ‘young people'. An apprenticeship now is not only a project for the young; it is a project for mature persons who seek to improve themselves from having basic employment skills in areas of declining employment. I think all congratulations are due to those who do make that choice, because it is quite difficult. Nevertheless, whilst it is just a trial program, the Skills for Sustainability for Australian Apprentices is of great interest to me. I think it is a great idea. I think it is a pity in the second reading speech, the minister did not bother to tell us where these sorts of opportunities might exist in the future. What you have to be to participate in the government's program of carbon pollution reduction is of course a screen jockey. You have to be an employee of a hedge fund or a bank, or someone else who is going to try and re-establish your respectability, having destroyed the world economy on your last attempt. And you are going to be given the opportunity to gamble on certificates to pollute. I thought that was a pretty bad place to start in addressing a problem that appears to be universal, throughout the globe, where Australia could be a contributor in providing the world with the technology that might work. The technology that the world has provided to date will not work in any significant fashion, be it wind generation, solar power or any of those things, simply because they lack the substance or, if you like, the capacity to work. But there are opportunities within the present technology, and one might wonder if the minister, in coming up with this particular program, might have thought it a good idea to have a special class in the management of high-voltage DC transmission systems. HVDC, as we know it, is most notable, but not recognised by many, as the means of transmitting electricity across Bass Strait. It had to be chosen on that occasion simply because you could not have a series of posts along the way with a transformer, which is a necessary energy-consuming component of high-voltage AC transmission, on which the Australian system relies with only a couple of exceptions. And the great advantage of high-voltage DC transmission is that you can shift electrical energy over huge distances. The Chinese are presently building a 2,000-kilometre transmission line-being constructed, I might add, by people with that, whom I have significant contact in this arena because I believe I have to learn, as other parliamentarians in this place do not. The fact is that ABB, as it is now known-it was once Asea Brown Boveri-is building that line for the Chinese. The Europeans are flat out utilising this technology because it saves emissions just by being in existence. It does not require a great deal of inventiveness. It does not require hundreds of billions of dollars, as might be required in proving up carbon capture and sequestration, which I have never seen as a logical response to the problem because it just says, ‘We'll make the problem go away'. In the utilisation of high-voltage DC transmission, however, you reduce the amount of energy lost, particularly over long distances. And it can compete with gas pipelines. Gas pipelines are very energy inefficient. The one that delivers gas from the Pilbara to the City of Perth uses in its compressors the power equivalent to one of the coalfired power stations that service the state250 megawatts. Yet, if the electricity that is generated from that pipeline when it gets to Perth was in fact generated at the well-head end-on the beach, if you like, in the case of offshore gas reserves-and sent down on HVDC, you would lose significantly less energy and you would have consequent improvement in emissions. I wonder how many apprentices are doing their time in that technology. It is a pity that there was not some sort of list in the explanatory memorandum or somewhere else which tells us where this smart alec idea is going to work. There are huge opportunities in the reform of energy generation-and the evidence is all there. It is not new technology; we do not have to invent it, although we could leverage off, from a technological basis, some of the generating opportunities that would follow an adequate HVDC system, which in my mind ought to be now under construction as the appropriate stimulus package instead of wasting money as is being done at the moment on school facilities that are unnecessary in many cases, in building passenger railways that will lose money forever and-I will get the minister at the table, the Minister for Housing, to put her head up when I say this-in public housing that will cost money for ever and ever thereafter. I noted the other day that the Western Australian parliament has had to budget $8 million simply to fix up the houses that have been trashed under their responsibility at the moment. But the reality is that, if apprentices are going to be given $1,000, as this act provides, for the purpose of gaining skills in sustainability, I think it would be a good idea if the parliament gave it some privileges. But, as I said, this government has stepped out to build public housing, passenger railways and of course spread a mere $24 billion in cash around, but if it had chosen to invest that sort of money in sustainable energy initiatives that are available and would easily fit within those costs, they would not have this procession of industry groups coming along and saying, ‘Please don't drive us out of the country with an emissions trading scheme,' which at the end will give no guarantee of reducing emissions. It is in fact a process of selling certificates to pollute. The question to how much your business or your consumers can bear of that cost will decide what reductions might follow. We are talking about a good idea here, which is to get apprentices dealing in new technology. That might be hydrogen fuel cell technology, which would be a great opportunity for young people. It is a technology that will happen, as will the plug-in electric car and the technology associated with lithium ion batteries and all other things that will be associated with that process. The reality is that what the government is doing, notwithstanding the offering of the minister for resources today-I had to watch him on television because you are not allowed to make jokes in this place any more!-when he talked about this massive investment in sustainability, is peanuts. The government cannot make a major contribution of less than $10 billion. An investment of that amount would be a starting point and it could deliver a 10 or 15 per cent long-term, permanent reduction in emissions without sending aluminium smelters et cetera to the wall. Other countries, and particularly China, are taking this option. Their centralised bureaucratic structure will not lead to the sort of market solution that the Rudd government believes will drive Australian business to save the world. They are investing in renewables or non-emitting technology such as nuclear power. They have 25 such projects on the drawing board or under construction as we speak. Even the Iranians, for whatever reason, are building a nuclear power station, presumably so that they can sell more oil! Australia, with its tidal energy resource, has one of the biggest renewable energy resources in the world, according to the World Energy Council. A body associated with Oxford University can come out here and tell us what we have on a world table and you never hear a bleep from this government, which as says that it wants to go to Copenhagen and lead the world in a response to the issues of carbon emissions and climate change. We have two choices as a nation. I can tell you that we will be giving apprentices $1,000 to get sustainability skills, but if in fact the whole system is going to be driven by screen jockeys-apparently they will all live in Sydney, because New South Wales government ministers are salivating over the profits that will accrue to Sydney arising from an emissions trading scheme. If someone takes a profit out of the trading concept, that is an extra cost that somebody else has to pay. Yet we are talking here today of what apprentices might do. We will not have electric cars or hydrogen fuel cell cars, which in fact still require an electricity input to elecdifferent trolyse the water to produce hydrogen, unless we produce more electricity. So apprentices need to learn how better to produce renewable electricity at the gigawatt level, as could occur in the Kimberleys. The technology associated with the conversions for highvoltage DC transmission-and these things only cost $250 million a pop-is the sort of opportunity that the minister should have talked about in his second reading speech. The speech should have referred to directing young people to these opportunities and giving them the opportunity to earn $1,000 or more. But of course those projects are not on the drawing board. There is no opportunity for young apprentices to learn about that because this government does not believe in it. The government's ETS provides more opportunities for repairers of desktop computers, because that is what the scheme is all about. It is not about creating opportunities in technology. And the lousy few hundred million dollars that the minister boasted about today will simply not deliver anything like that needed from government. If the money that was put into public housing was put into an initiative like that a lot of people would not need public housing because their jobs would not be at risk, as is patently obvious they will be when you start to jack up the competitive costs of local industries such as iron, steel and aluminium, where the workforce is often filled with loyal Labor votesbut that does not seem to worry this government. Maybe the intelligentsia will re-elect them. Concerning sustainability for apprentices learning, while there are no projects and while projects are not necessarily going to come from industry because they have been taxed to a point where they have no money left-and that is the theory behind ETS; you make things so costly that people will make expenditure choices. They will have no money and, as things stand, they will in fact be competing with the government to borrow money. We touched on this in question time today but I did not think the Treasurer had much of an idea of what he was talking about and nor did the Prime Minister when quoting the interest rate spreads-you cannot borrow the money in Australia, so what is the point. Anyway, coming back to the issue, the Skills for Sustainability Australian apprentices grant is a sensible initiative. Outside some technical adjustments, the Skills for Sustainability Australian apprentices grant is the thing that should be pointing the way for young people in terms of opportunity but it is lacking in that it does not tell the kids what it happens to be. As I said, at the moment the only proposition before this parliament is a screen jockey's opportunity because that is what an ETS is. An ETS is a process of licensing people to pollute and trying to drive them into some sort of reduced emissions position by making it too expensive to stay where they are. But it ignores the option of leaving Australia completely or passing the cost on downstream, as can occur in electricity generation where there is a captive consumer market. So what are the kids going to learn there? You should say to them, ‘Here are the opportunities.' One of the reasons for the lack of opportunities is that the government are not investing in saws or planing units or anything like that. Instead, they have taken all the basic investments of sustainabilitynone of them have a technological peakwhen that same money could have been put into achieving up to a 40 per cent reduction in emissions trading for Australia and would have led the way for apprentices to have genuine sustainability skills. NA commend the former speaker for his contribution to the debate. I too rise in support of the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Australian Apprentices) Bill 2009. This bill is about a very minor amendment to various acts but it will make a huge difference for thousands of apprentices throughout the country. Being an apprentice is not something that I have experienced in my varied careers. But I remember that, when I was in year 7, I basically decided that I wanted to become an apprentice butcher and leave school. That was not so much about a love of the butchering industry but more because the nun who taught me at the time terrified me. I thought that the best tion was to join my family's profession, which is the meat trade. My grandfather was a butcher and so were my father, my uncle and two of my brothers, so I thought that that was the way to go. As it turned out, I did not go that way. I know that there are a couple of meatworkers in the parliament and they make a contribution. I did not go down the route of an apprenticeship and instead ended up being a teacher and the like. Apprentices are a very important section of the community and one that we definitely need to look after as much as possible. The legislation before the House amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to ensure that the Skills for Sustainability and Tools for Your Trade payments made to apprentices are not assessable income for tax purposes. This is quite significant legislation for apprentices. It is quite significant in the current economic climate that it got past Treasurer Swan as well, I guess. But he understands the benefits of looking after these skills and making sure that they are nurtured and developed, especially in tough economic times. These legislative changes will ensure that the apprentices and the community get the full benefit of these two programs by them not being assessable income for tax purposes. There are about 400,000 apprentices in training around the country. I will declare a possible conflict of interest here. My nephew, Joel Perrett, is an apprentice and possibly might benefit from this enhancement. I will not declare every single member of my family who has been an apprentice in the past, but for the sake of clarity and in order to be honest and respectable I will declare that possible conflict of interest-and so that Joel has the thrill of being named in parliament. He works in the building industry, with cranes in particular. One of my op- other brothers works in the crane industry. Obviously, they are particularly sensitive to the swings and roundabouts of the economic climate. They are based down on the Gold Coast and they are probably doing work in the electorate of the good member for Moncrieff, where a lot of high-rise construction is taking place. So I declare that possible conflict of interest. These apprentices, these men and women-and I was going to say young men and women, but I know that that is not necessarily the case anymore; people are going back as mature age apprentices nowadaysare learning the skills and know-how through on-the-job experience to ensure that we have the skills that we need to carry Australia forward into the future. It is particularly important that we do this when times are tough so that we are ready to come out of the trough. We must be ready for that. People batten down the hatches and markets tighten up when economic circumstances deteriorate, so it is important that the government does what it can to make sure that people are primed, ready and trained-retrained if necessary-so as to go into overdrive when the market turns around. I am sure that all those in the House would take heart from the economic outlook figures that we have seen over the last few weeks. There would not be anyone partaking of dole queue schadenfreude and hoping for things to go bad. Instead, I am sure that we all want the best for Australia. The Skills for Sustainability program for Australian apprentices is a great initiative to encourage apprentices to complete the sustainability related training. They receive $1,000 once they have successfully completed the required level of training. Obviously, $1,000 is not as much today as it was when I was contemplating going into the butchering trade in 1977, but $1,000 is still quite significant and a great incentive. Australian workplaces are crying out for people with training in environmentally sustainable work practices, and the Skills for Sustainability payment will provide an added incentive to apprentices who complete their training in this area. It will also give them a head start when it comes time to find a job. Those who are equipped to meet the sustainability challenges that they might face on the job will obviously be ahead of the pack. This skill will become much more of a factor for employers when they determine who will become their employees. As Australia transitions slowly but surely and inevitably to a low carbon economy-I say this irrespective of what goes on in the red chamberconsumers will increasingly want outcomes that are good for the environment. The apprentices who benefit from these programs will be well equipped and ready to deliver. Incidentally, the idea of the Skills for tainability program came out of the Australia 2020 Summit convened by the Prime Minister in April 2008 and held in this building. This is further evidence that politicians do not have all the bright ideas and it also shows that this government is prepared to listen to good ideas no matter where they come from. Obviously, there are many people who feel that, if we just listen to taxi drivers, we could solve all of the world's problems pretty quickly. But the 2020 Summit went beyond just taxi drivers; it engaged lots of different people from lots of different sections within our community and some great ideas flowed from that. In the weeks leading up to the national 2020 Summit, I held a community forum in my electorate in conjunction with Griffith University and, in particular, the Nathan campus. More than 400 people filled the auditorium at Griffith University. We shared a few hours of robust debate and information sharing. There are certainly some very passionate people with some very firmly held beliefs. It was a fantastic experience and it was important for me as the new local member to be informed about the range of views in my community-although, there were times when I wished that the range of views had not been quite as broad as was presented. But, nevertheless, it was great for the community to be heard, and that is why I, in partnership with Griffith university, will be holding a Southside summit on 22 August this year. If the member for Moncrieff wants to put that date in his diary, he is more than welcome to attend. I would be more than happy to have him address a particular section of the community. A range of topics will be up for discussion, and I am sure that we will hear more great ideas like the Skills for Sustainability program. As I mentioned earlier, the other payment Susproposed in this legislation is Tools For Your Trade. This new payment combines and extends three programs previously offered to Australian apprentices to support them in undertaking apprenticeships in areas of national skills shortage. The Tools For Your Trade payment includes five separate cash payments, totalling $3,800 over the life of an apprenticeship. They are not insignificant amounts of cash, especially for an apprentice. This new payment will help more apprentices make life easier for employers and it will also ensure that Australian apprentices in areas of skills shortage are eligible for the same level of support. Importantly, this bill ensures that payments made to apprentices under these programs will be tax exempt. I understand this is in line with the tax treatment of other programs that have made similar payments to apprentices. The two programs are worth about $700 million over four years. So we are not talking about just a few dollars or a token gesture; this is significant cash on the table to ensure that our apprentices, be they young, old or mature, are able to complete their training with as much support as possible from the government. I am sure that everyone can see the benefits of the programs in encouraging apprentices to undertake training in areas of workforce shortage and sustainability. Any investment that we can pump into meeting skills shortages and equipping people for the climate change jobs of the future is money well spent as far as I am concerned. On a related note, earlier this year I was pleased to meet 10 young people working on the Green Corps project to improve water quality and protect the local flora and fauna in the Rocky Water Holes Creek area of the Oxley Creek catchment in my electorate. Unfortunately, the Rocky Water Holes Creek area floods fairly regularly, and that has a significant impact on the suburbs of Rocklea and Salisbury. It was great to go along and meet the guys who were working on the Green Corps project. They were cleaning up the river bank around the construction training centre and attempting to move rubbish from lantana. It was amazing to see the filth and rubbish that had accumulated there over the last 20, 30, 40 or 50 years. I took some photographs of these young people and have included them in a newsletter. Mr Gray interjectingNA ple tomorrow. Mr Gray-I would appreciate that. NA people had not necessarily been the most successful at school. A couple of them had made a decision to go into an environmental job because that is what they had always wanted to do. Some were being trained up so that they could spend a year backpacking overseas and perhaps use their green skills in other parts of the world that may be a little more embracing of legislation like the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. It was a great opportunity to meet these young guys working on the Green Corps, and they seemed to be picking up a lot of skills. Obviously, things have changed a bit in terms of the knowledge that they need. They now have to know how to use personal protective equipment and different types of machines such as brush-cutters and the like, which seemed incredibly dangerous. These young people said that they would not let me touch any of the brush-cutters, which was probably a wise decision. This is a great training opportunity and experience for young job seekers, and these young people are doing a great job in helping to regenerate local native plant species through weeding, planting and water quality monitoring. These programs that are before the House will help ease the financial burden for apprentices and encourage more into training areas of sustainability and skill shortages. Why are we doing this? We are doing this because the government understands that a carbon restrained economy is all but upon us. If you doorknock any household in my electorate of Moreton, I am sure two out of three would say they understand that something has to be done about climate change. You occasionally get the ill-informed people who think that the world's global warming problems were changed last year when the Kyoto protocol was signed, but most understand that more has to be done. Carbon belts have to be tightened in every household. It was great to see these 15-, 16-, 17and 18-yearold guys and girls who have done it a bit tough being given the opportunity to train and do their bit to save the planet. That view is not necessarily shared by everyone in the House or in the Senate; there are people who still do not quite get it. I know that all the forward-thinking members of the Liberal Party would certainly be in favour of getting some legislation in as soon as possible-legislation that would be ahead of the curve, as they say, in what the world needs. However, it is not a bad thing for Australia to take a leadership position when it comes to climate change. As I indicated earlier in my speech, there will be job opportunities and opportunities to export our technologies and knowledge around the world if we can steal a march on those other countries that are still filled with sceptics. I would to think that in this parliament in 2009, after all the debates in the House and in the Senate about climate change, people will find out that this was the group of people that betrayed the later generations, that this was the group of people who did not read the writing writ large on the wall. Still there are sceptics. Still there are people who go overseas, talk to a couple of scientists-possibly not mainstream scientists; I do not know-and then say, ‘Oh no, I spoke to someone who had a different view; therefore, we need to revise our whole understanding.' I am hoping that those opposite will take the opportunity to inform their caucus and that we will have some movement on this legislation so that those young people whom I met during my visits to the Green Corps can take heart from the politicians in this House. I commend the bill to the House.",121
144,Ms HALL ,"Shortland) (8.18 pm)-It gives me great pleasure to speak on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Australian Apprentices) Bill 2009 in the House tonight. This bill will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to allow Australian apprentices to receive the full value, without deduction, of payments made under Skills for Sustainability for Australian Apprentices and Tools For Your Trade within the Australian Apprenticeship Incentives Program. In addition, it will make the taxation treatment of payments under the two new programs consistent with the treatment of previous programs that deliver payments to Australian apprentices. There is no more important role that a government can play than to ensure that Australia has appropriately trained tradespeople. How do you get appropriately trained tradespeople? People need to undertake apprenticeships. Unfortunately, under the previous hate government a chronic skills shortage was allowed to develop in many of the trades. Coming from the Hunter, in which my electorate of Shortland is situated, it was very apparent that employers were unable to obtain suitably qualified tradespeople. Unfortunately for Australia, the Howard government chose to do absolutely nothing. They allowed this chronic skills shortage to get worse and worse. That meant that we had fewer and fewer qualified tradespeople. The Rudd government's approach is totally different to the Howard government's approach. We know that Australia is part of a global market. We are part of the global economy. For Australia to benefit from being part of that global market and global economy, we must have appropriately trained tradespeople, tradespeople who have completed apprenticeships and tradespeople who are highly skilled. The only way we will get these tradespeople is for them to undertake apprenticeships. The financial impact of the Skills for Sustainability for Australian Apprentices is estimated to cost about $20 million over four years. The other program, Tools For Your Trade within the broader Australian Apprenticeship Incentives Program, is estimated to cost about $670.1 million over four years. Every cent of that is worthwhile spending, because it will encourage more young people to undertake apprenticeships. I know that when the previous government was in power there was a lot of rhetoric about supporting apprentices, about training apprentices, about how undertaking an occupation as a tradesperson was a noble aspiration. We know that and we are making it possible by putting in place programs like these two that are included in this legislation. As I have already indicated, the bill exempts the value of payments made under Skills for Sustainability for Australian Apprentices and Tools For Your Trade from treatment as assessable income for income tax purposes and from the income tax test for benefits under social security and veterans affairs legislation. This is a major incentive for young people to undertake training as apprentices. The amendments ensure that Australian apprentices receive the full benefit of the payments made under the two new programs. They are consistent with the taxation treatment of previous programs that have paid personal benefits to Australian apprentices. While we are talking about apprentices and apprenticeship programs, I would like to share with the House details of the launch of a program that took place in the Hunter last Wednesday, 10 June. It was a rather cold morning and 60 bold and brave souls turned out early for the launch of the Adopt an Apprentice program. The campaign was launched by nine group training schools working in Newcastle, Lake Macquarie, the Hunter Valley and the Central Coast. I might add that the Shortland electorate also takes in the Central Coast. The campaign is to keep apprentices working during the current downturn. It is really important to emphasise that we have had a skills shortage in the economic good times and what we need to do now is train our young people so they will be ready once the downturn is over. The group training organisations have set aside their own interests and identities as entities and set out to work together. That is a really important point. They are joining together in a campaign aimed at assisting employers and also apprentices whose training positions are under threat. I congratulate all those who are involved, especially the group training company NovaSkill, who have provided the leadership on this initiative. To anyone who may be listening in the Hunter-Central Coast area, I have considerable information on this program that can be obtained from my electorate office. The Adopt an Apprentice program will assist apprentices to continue their trade training and the completion of their trade qualification at a time when their jobs under threat. Employers will have maintained a pool of skilled labour to meet future demands as the economy recovers. Potential employers should go to the website and have a look at the availability of apprentices and then register their interest with the responsible group training program. The Adopt an Apprentice campaign is a call to arms, which is the way the group apprenticeship organisations have put it. It is a call to arms, and employers are working together to keep young apprentices in work in these uncertain times. The campaign highlights that young apprentices, through no fault of their own, are affected and still need to complete their training. Initiatives like this really show what can be done. If people are interested in checking it out, the website for the Adopt an Apprentice program is: www.apprenticeships.det.nsw.ed.au. They can obtain the information that they need from that website. The reason I have brought this program to the attention of the House is that it recognises how important tradespeople are to Australia. This program recognises that governments should do everything in their power to help young people complete their apprenticeships. Skills for Sustainability for Australian Apprentices is one such program. It is a pilot program within the Skills for the Carbon Challenge initiative. This initiative is an outcome of Australia's 2020 Summit which aims to accelerate industries' and tertiary education's response to climate change. It is an innovative program aimed at training apprentices and giving them the kinds of skills that they will need for the future. To encourage Australian apprentices to undertake sustainability related training, the payment of $1,000 will be provided to eligible Australian apprentices who have successfully completed the required level of training which teaches skills as to sustainable and environmentally sustainable work practices, all very important at this time. It was only last week that we debated the CPRS legislation in this parliament and now we are encouraging young people to obtain trade qualifications in environmental areas, which is very important. There is also the Tools For Your Trade payment initiative within the broader Australian Apprenticeships Incentives Program. That combines and extends three administratively complex programs previously available to Australian apprentices. So it is good for employers and it is good for apprentices. The new payment initiative comprises five separate cash payments totalling $3,800, paid over the life of the Australian apprenticeship. The new arrangement reduces the administrative burden on employers of Australian apprentices, broadening eligibility criteria. By doing that it is benefiting more Australian apprentices and it is also, as I have mentioned, benefiting employers. It will ensure that Australian apprentices in areas of skill shortages become trained. These apprentices are eligible for the same level of government support regardless of their age and of their employer's size. These two new programs represent significant measures and encourage Australian apprentices to develop skills in sustainability in order to participate in the workforce. This is important legislation. The issue of training apprentices was brought up at the 2020 Summit. Payments under Skills for Sustainability for Australian Apprentices is a very important measure, as are all the measures in this legislation. The legislation that we have before us today should be supported by all in the House. By supporting this legislation we are ensuring that we have suitably trained tradespeople for the future. Debate interrupted. PETITIONS Responses Mrs Irwin-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, and in accordance with standing order 209, I present the following ministerial responses to petitions that have been received: Mr Farzad Kamangar Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter dated 8 May 2009 on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, concerning a petition against the death penalty in Iran and the possible execution of a Kurdish Iranian teacher, Mr Farzad Kamangar. The Government is committed to promoting international human rights standards in Iran, including equal treatment for all Iran's citizens. The Australian Government is deeply concerned by reports of persecution of political and social activists and the ongoing suppression of freedom of expression. Australian officials, in Canberra and Tehran, have made clear repeatedly to the Iranian authorities Australia's strong concerns about human rights in Iran. In addition, Australia has joined with the European Union in representations to the Iranian Government, calling on Iran to fulfil its international human rights obligations, including with respect to Mr Kamangar's Kurdish community. On the specific case of Mr Kamangar, we joined with the European Union in 2008 in expressing our concerns to the Government of Iran. As far as we are aware, Mr Kamangar's sentence of execution has not been carried out. Our Embassy in Tehran will continue to monitor his case. The Government also has a policy of global opposition to the death penalty, and is working with the international community to achieve its universal abolition. Australia was an original co-sponsor of this year's United Nations General Assembly's resolution on the moratorium on the use of the death penalty, and is working actively with likeminded countries in New York to ensure that this issue remains on the General Assembly's agenda. The Australian Government will continue to raise its concerns about human rights in Iran with the Iranian authorities. Thank you for referring this petition to me. From the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Stephen Smith. Education Funding Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter dated 8 May 2009 about the petition submitted for the Committee's consideration on the proposal to relocate the East Gippsland TAFE and to develop a multi-sports complex for the Gippsland region. An application for these activities was recently submitted by Wellington Shire Council under the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure ProgramStrategic Projects (RLCIP-SP). I am pleased to inform you that the application submitted to the RLCIP-SP by the Council for the Gippsland Regional Sports Complex - Sale has been approved for funding of $3,250,000. The Rudd Government is delivering record funding of $800 million to local governments under the RLCIP to build and improve community infrastructure, support local jobs, and stimulate local economies during the global economic recession. Thank you for raising this matter. From the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Mr Albanese. Statements",128
145,Mrs IRWIN ,"Fowler) (8.31 pm)-In recent weeks during my statements to the House I have focused on the value that has been gained from public hearings held by the Standing Committee on Petitions. The committee has been very pleased with the level of engagement from petitioners and with the support it has received from ministers and departments. This evening, I would like to refer to two other aspects of the committee's work, and to some of the benefits that we can hope to gain. The first aspect relates to access to information about petitions and the second aspect relates to the cooperation and goodwill that is shown to the committee by other parliaments as they share information about their petitions processes. As you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, the petitions committee was first established in this the 42nd Parliament. To some extent it is carving out new territory, although, of course, I acknowledge the long tradition of petitions to the United Kingdom parliament and the inheritance in Australia of the right to petition our parliament. Australians have long been exercising that right. Something that is new to our petitions process, I believe, is the high degree of responsiveness by the executive to issues that are raised in petitions. In this way, I would argue that petitions can be seen to have a greater impact and petitioners may feel they are having increased success in getting their message across. Something else that is new to the House, and which may be contributing to the effectiveness of petitioning, is the petitions committee's centralised collection and publication on its website of information about petitions. That information includes details on the process of petitioning the House, the terms of petitions, statements made by members when presenting those petitions, evidence given to the committee by petitioners and public servants and the written responses made by ministers when the committee refers petitions to them. Anyone who is interested is able to see on the committee's website not only the terms of petitions that have been presented to the House-collected under headings that relate to the portfolio area covering the subject of the petition-but also other petitions that relate to the same subject areas. They can also see very clearly the ways that the issues that have been raised in the petitions have been dealt with by members, the House and the government. Enabling easy public access to this information is a significant aspect of the committee's work. When the House or Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure presented its 2007 report on petitioning the House, it began a process that culminated in the changing of arrangements for petitions and the establishment of the petitions committee. The Procedure Committee considered itself bound by six principles of petitioning. I will outline those principles, and what I think the committee intended by them. The principles were that, first, petitions belong to the public. Behind this is the belief that the ability members of the public to communicate directly with the House is important to our democracy. Secondly, petitions sent to the House should be addressed by the House. The Procedure Committee considered that the establishment of a petitions committee was the most effective way for the House to act in relation to petitions. Thirdly, governments should respond. The Procedure Committee wanted to encourage ministers and their departments to respond in a timely way to the issues raised in petitions. Fourthly, members' involvement should be enhanced and streamlined. By this, the Procedure Committee meant that members had an important role to play in raising and debating the issues addressed in petitions. Fifthly, rules should be relevant and fair. The committee sought to encourage a process, including the process of preparing petitions, which was easier for petitioners. Sixthly, information technologies should be used more effectively. The traditional right of people to address their grievances directly to the King now needs to be aligned with modern technology. In particular, the Procedure Committee stated that the House could not ignore the possibilities raised by electronic petitions. I suggest that these principles have, to one degree or another, been applied. I would like to expand on the final principle, the effective use of information technology, and some unexpected benefits that have been obtained. In June last year, the Petitions Committee decided to inquire into the introduction of an electronic petitioning system for the House of Representatives. In particular, the committee wanted to consider the different models of electronic petitioning that might be introduced, changes that might be required to House practices and procedures in order to implement e-petitions, the role of members, privacy and security concerns, resource implications and the experience of of other relevant jurisdictions. This is a significant inquiry for the committee and the House and it will be completed later this year. The committee was grateful to hear from other parliaments about their innovations in petitions. It has received submissions from the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council in Tasmania and the Scottish Parliament Public Petitions Committee. The committee has held a videoconference with the Scottish committee, enabling a very constructive discussion and establishing a relationship that continues to this day. The Scottish committee is about to report on its inquiry into the public petitions process, and the report will be read with interest. The Queensland parliament, like the Scottish Parliament Public Petitions Committee, is generous in sharing information and views on the issues raised by e-petitions. The issues raised by petitions in modern parliaments are many and varied and the experience gained by other parliaments is valuable to us. In closing, I would like to acknowledge the cooperative attitude of committees and parliaments in other jurisdictions and the professional relationships being developed by the petitions committee. I think what we have in common is a definite commitment to facilitating direct engagement by members of the public with our parliaments. COMMITTEES Intelligence and Security Committee",131
146,Mr BEVIS ,"Brisbane) (8.37 pm)-On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I present the committee's report entitled Review of the relisting of Ansar al-Islam, AAA, IAA, IMU, JeM and LeJ as terrorist organisations. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",133
147,Mr BEVIS,"This report has departed from the usual format of terrorist proscription reports. In this report the committee has sought some improvements with respect to the statement of reasons process. The committee recommends that in future the Attorney-General provide the committee with a statement of reasons where a decision is taken not to re-list an organisation, similar that now supplied when an organisation is listed. There is no requirement for the Attorney General to provide the committee with detailed reasons when he decides not to re-list an organisation. However, it would be useful if, where the Attorney-General has decided he will not be re-listing an organisation as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code, a statement of reasons explaining his decision is provided to the committee and that there also be a publicly released statement of reasons. The committee was advised that the Attorney-General recently considered advice from the Director-General of Security with respect to the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ). Based on that advice he stated he would not be re-listing EIJ as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code after the current listing expired on 30 March 2009. The committee's recommendations would enhance transparency and public confidence in this important process. The committee in this parliament and earReport lier parliaments has taken the view that the non-statutory guidelines used by ASIO are a useful tool in evaluating the evidence supporting a listing or re-listing. The committee believes it would be helpful in its role if the statement of reasons were written in part in a way that directly links the evidence with the ASIO guidelines. This approach would also better inform public understanding of the listing process and outcomes. The committee has also requested that future statements of reasons be drafted, in part, in such a way that the information is directly referrable to the statutory criteria for listing contained within the Criminal Code. I turn to the current regulations. They to were signed by the Governor General on 13 March 2009. They were then tabled in the House and the Senate on 17 March 2009. The disallowance period of 15 sitting days for the committee's review of the listing began from the date of the tabling. Therefore the committee has conducted its affairs in order for it to report to the parliament by today, Monday 15 June 2009. Notice of the inquiry was placed on the committee's website and in the national daily newspaper. One submission was received from a public organisation. Representatives of the Federation of Community Legal Centres (Vic.) Inc., the Attorney-General's Department and ASIO attended a private hearing on the listings. I now quickly turn to other organisations. Ansar al-Islam Ansar al-Islam has immediate objectives to overthrow the Iraqi government, expel coalition forces from the country and establish a Sunni Islamic state administered under Shariah law. The last confirmed terrorist act Ansar alIslam was involved in was an attack on a Peshmerga barracks, reportedly killing 19 people and destroying two vehicles on 13 August 2008. The committee does not recommend disallowance of the regulation in relation to Ansar al-Islam. Asbat al-Ansar (AAA) Asbat al Ansar, AAA, has objectives to establish a Sunni Islamic state in Lebanon by overthrowing the Lebanese government, eliminating Israel and impeding anti-Islamic and pro-Western influences in Lebanon. The group believes its struggle justifies violence against civilians. Its strategies in seeking its objectives include the use of terrorist tactics. AAA remains focused on supporting jihad in Iraq and planning attacks against Lebanese security forces, and Western interests. The committee does not recommend disallowance of the regulation in relation to the AAA. Islamic Army of Aden (IAA) The Islamic Army of Aden, IAA, is a Sunni Islamic extremist group that first came to public prominence in 1998, when it issued statements detailing its intention to overthrow the Yemeni government and implement Shariah law; and called for operations against Western interests in Yemen. In March-April members of the group suspected of planning to travel to Iraq to fight foreign forces were arrested. The committee does not recommend disallowance of the regulation in relation to the IAA. Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan The IMU is now fighting in support of the Taliban. The committee does not recommend disallowance of the regulation in relation to the IMU. Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) The JeM is a Sunni Islamic organisation also based in Pakistan. The committee does not recommend disallowance of the regulation in relation to JeM. Lashkar-e Jhangvi (LeJ) The LeJ is a Sunni Islamic group involved in terrorist activities including attacks in Lahore. The committee does not recommend disallowance of the regulation in relation to LeJ. In conclusion, as I have done on other occasions, I note the cooperation of members of the committee and thank them for their involvement and also thank the secretariat. (Time expired)",133
148,Mr RUDDOCK ,"Berowra) (8.43 pm)-I intend to speak in support of the report and the remarks of the chair in relation to the continued proscription of these six organisations. They were organisations initially listed as terrorist organisations in 2003, and each of them had been listed on the United Nations list of terrorist organisations. They came up for review under the new legislative arrangements passed by parliament in 2004, and the committee therefore reviewed the first re-listing of these organisations in 2005. Following this, the committee again reviewed these re-listings in June 2007. So this is the third review of re-listing of these six terrorist organisations. The chair has been through a brief outline of the circumstances which lead us to a view that the Attorney has properly listed these organisations. In the report is some useful information to help guide those who are interested in understanding the sorts of criteria that apply in relation to listing organisations. ASIO's guidelines, as they were outlined to us in evidence in 2005, include factors such as engagement in terrorism, ideology and links to other terrorist groups or networks, links to Australia, the threat to Australian interests, proscription by the United Nations or likeminded countries, and engagement in peace and mediation processes. The committee noted that these guidelines are indicators only and not formally set out in the act but has found them a useful tool in its deliberations. The committee continues to use these guidelines to assist it in relation to its reviews. The Federation of Community Legal Centres made the point to us that, in the case of six organisations, the statements of reasons did not identify that any of the organisations in question have links to Australia. I note that the committee's view is that it is a misunderstanding of the statutory scheme to suggest that listing of an organisation with no identifiable links to Australia exceeds the scope of the legislative intent or is a misuse of power. The committee takes the view that, while direct links to Australia are not a statutory prerequisite, links are appropriate considerations in the selection of organisations for proscription. I think it is important because in the context of threats to Australia's interests they can be posed to our citizens abroad as well as our interests that extend beyond the territorial boundaries of Australia. They are matters that were relevant to the committee in its deliberations in relation to these particular organisations. I continue to be impressed with the quality of the deliberations of my colleagues on these matters. I have seen the other side of the wicket, as it were, and believe that they bring a very mature deliberation to this task. I think it is one of the most important tasks that parliamentary committees can be engaged in. The committee is assisted by a very able secretary. I see Robert Little in the advisers' box; he is the inquiry secretary. I say to him and his colleagues that we very much value your collective efforts and the work that you undertake to ensure that in relation to these very important deliberations we are well informed and able to fulfil our responsibilities. I commend the report of the committee to the House and assure honourable members that these matters are important. They are important for securing the safety of the broader Australian community based here and abroad. I am delighted to be associated with this particular report. Treaties Committee Report",134
149,Mr KELVIN THOMSON ,"Wills) (8.48 pm)-On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report entitled Report 101: Treaties tabled on 3 February 2009 Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",135
150,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,"In presenting Report 101 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I note that this report views two treaty actions: firstly, the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions and, secondly, the Agreement between Australia and the European Community on Trade in Wine. In each case the treaties committee has supported the proposed treaties and has recommended that binding treaty action be taken. The Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions identifies the expression of culture by an individual or group as a tangible entity. The purpose of the convention is to protect and promote the diverse range of these cultural expressions in an increasingly globalised world. The convention requires nations to undertake to assist the creation of cultural expressions both domestically and abroad through regulatory, legislative, financial and technical assistance and to report to the United Nations on these measures. The convention is particularly concerned with securing cultural expressions that are under immediate threat and securing the cultural expressions of developing nations. The treaties committee is of the view that the convention will help to develop and maintain Australia's cultural industries protect Australia's valuable cultural expressions. The committee considers that accession to the convention will demonstrate to the international community Australia's commitment to cultural diversity and that it will expand Australia's active engagement with UNESCO. The treaties committee also considered the Agreement between Australia and the European Community on Trade in Wine. Under this agreement Australia and the European Community are required to accept a range of wine labelling restrictions based on the production and geographical origin of the wine and to recognise 16 previously unauthorised rewinemaking techniques. Significantly, Australian fortified winemakers will be required to phase out the use of the terms ‘port' and ‘sherry' within 12 months of the entry into force of the agreement and the term ‘tokay' will have to be phased out within 10 years of the agreement's entry into force. The Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation assured the committee that, whilst there will be a cost to the industry in ceasing the use of these wine names, the agreement will secure the use of terms which are valuable to Australia's fortified wine industry, including ‘ruby', ‘tawny', ‘vintage' and ‘cream'. Furthermore, the government has provided financial assistance which will assist in the rebadging of wines. This project will see the term ‘sherry' replaced with the term ‘apera' within 12 months and the term ‘tokay' replaced with ‘topaque' within 10 years. In exchange for Australia's acceptance of these labelling restrictions, the European Community will be required to permit the import and marketing of Australian wines produced using 16 winemaking techniques which previously lacked authorisation. Therefore, Australian winemakers stand to gain greater access to European wine marand to kets under the agreement. The treaties committee considers that accession to the agreement will strengthen trade between Australia and the European Community and is of the view that the agreement will provide Australian winemakers with greater and more secure access to European wine markets. I thank the numerous agencies, individuals and organisations who assisted in the treaties committee's inquiries, and I thank the treaties committee secretariat for its assistance in preparing this report. I commend the report to the House. Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee Report",136
151,Mr DREYFUS ,"Isaacs) (8.53 pm)-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I present the committee's report entitled Access all areas: Report of the inquiry into Draft Disability (Access to Premise-Buildings) Standards, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",137
152,Mr DREYFUS,"It is my pleasure to present the report Access all areas: Report of the inquiry into Draft Disability (Access to Premise-Buildings) Standards, which is the third report of the committee for this parliament. There are approximately four million people with a disability in Australia, a number which is expected to increase as the population ages. Every day people with a disability face physical barriers in the munity, from a doorway too narrow for a wheelchair, to not being able to visit their member of parliament because his or her office is located at the top of a flight of stairs. These physical barriers to the built environment have broader consequences for people with a disability, in restricting their access to the economic and social environment of our community. The draft Premises Standards are designed to make buildings more accessible for people with mobility, vision and hearing impairments. If introduced, the Premises Standards will have a widespread impact, changing buildings regulations for new buildings and existing buildings undergoing significant upgrades. As well as providing improved access, the Premises Standards would also provide certainty to building certifiers, developers and managers that they are complying with their obligations under the Commonwealth Disability Discrimination Act. In conducting the inquiry, the committee received evidence from disability advocacy groups, the property and building sectors and many concerned individuals. The level of interest in the inquiry clearly demonstrates how important these issues are to people with a disability. The report reflects the unanimous view of the committee that the Premises Standards should be finalised and introduced without delay. However, there are a number of areas of the Premises Standards which should be amended prior to their introduction. The committee has recommended that access be provided to the common areas of class 2 buildings, such as residential apartment buildings. It is clear that the market has not responded to the needs of people with a disability or to the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act, even where class 2 buildings are primarily used for short-term com- accommodation. As a result, people with a disability are excluded from an affordable accommodation option in serviced apartments which might otherwise be well suited for their needs. The committee's recommendation to include class 2 buildings within the scope of the Premises Standards reflects the overwhelming majority of evidence received. The committee also recommended that the Premises Standards distinguish between new and existing class 1b buildings. These are bed and breakfast, eco-lodges and similar accommodation. The committee found that the proportional cost increases imposed by the Premises Standards are substantial in existing class 1b buildings. The committee therefore considers that the current threshold of four bedrooms or dwellings for accessibility in existing buildings is appropriate. However, the increases in costs flowing from accessibility requirements in new class 1b buildings are much more modest. The committee has therefore recommended that accessibility requirements should be imposed on all new and purpose-built class 1b buildings, regardless of the number of rooms or dwellings they provide. Given the long and protracted history of the development of the Premises Standards, the committee has recommended that they be finalised and introduced without delay. However, there are a number of areas where more research is required and other areas which are the result of previous negotiation and compromise. It is important to assess whether the standards, and certain provisions in the standards, are working to achieve their object and purpose. As a result, the committee has made a detailed recommendation relating to the review of the Premises Standards after some years of operation. I would like to thank the other members of the committee and the skilled and dedicated staff of the secretariat who worked on this important inquiry: Anna Dacre, Serica Mackay, Stephen Still and Sharon Bryant, some of whom are with us in the advisers box. I would also like to acknowledge the contribution of all those who shared their time, expertise and experience with the committee during this inquiry. I have spoken of the committee's key recommendations for the draft Premises Standards. There are other relatively minor changes discussed in the committee's report.",137
153,Mr SLIPPER ,"Fisher) (8.58 pm)-I am pleased to join the chairman of the committee in supporting the report which has been tabled by the committee. Once again, it is a unanimous report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. We covered a very important area in relation to disability. This committee seems to work very well together. It is obviously a cross-party committee, but we put our politics aside when we consider terms of reference referred to us by responsible ministers. With respect to the report being tabled today, the committee was asked by the Attorney-General to consider and report on the draft Disability (Access to PremisesBuildings) Standards covering a range of areas including: the appropriateness and effectiveness of the proposed Premises Standards in achieving their objects; the interaction between the Premises Standards and existing regulatory schemes operating in state and territory jurisdictions, including the appropriateness and effectiveness of the proposed Model Process to Administer Building Access for People with Disability; whether the Premises Standards will have an unjustifiable impact on any particular sector or group within a sector; and any related matters. The committee received a substantial number of recommendations from across the country when we advertised for views, and we wanted to consult widely. In fact, we received 146 submissions. We held six public hearings and one round-table hearing. The whole idea of following this process was to try to discern what the Australian community was telling the committee and the parliament. As a result, following our deliberations the committee made 19 recommendations. The committee chairman outlined some of those recommendations but the first recommendation of the report is that Premises Standards should be introduced without delay. The Premises Standards has a protracted history and the committee considered that the benefits it will provide, such as certainty and accessibility, should not be delayed any further. That was particularly important. One of the key recommendations relates to class 2 buildings, which are residential apartment buildings. At the moment the Premises Standards does not require these buildings to be accessible. The committee has recommended that the common areas of class 2 buildings should be within the scope of the Premises Standards-that is, they should be made accessible. There were a number of reasons for that and it was obvious to the committee that those reasons have veracity and that the recommendations ought to be implemented. Class 1b buildings were also the subject of move: recommendation by the committee. Class 1b buildings include eco-lodges, bed and breakfasts and holiday cottages. At present, the Premises Standards only applies to class 1b buildings containing four or more bedrooms. This means that the accessibility requirements of the Premises Standards would not apply to these types of buildings that have fewer than four bedrooms. The committee recognises that many class 1b buildings are run by small businesses with limited resources. One of the things about disability and disability regulation is that there has to be a balance. On the one hand we have to give people access and we have to treat people with disability as being equal to other people in the community. On the other hand we are not really serving the interests of people with disability if we send small business to the wall in the process. The committee found that it was clear that it is much less expensive to provide access when building a new bed and breakfast or holiday cottage. That is why the committee has recommended that the requirements for accessibility should be imposed on all new and purpose built class 1b buildings regardless of the number of bedrooms they contain but that the proposed four-bedroom threshold should be maintained for existing buildings. There were a whole range of other matters in the report, and time will not allow me to cover them, but they include areas such as dignity, fit-out, and review. We also pointed out that lessons could be learnt from the review of the transport standards for which, seven years on, a final report has still not been released. (Time expired)",138
154,The DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Ms JA Saffin)-Does the member for Isaacs wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a later occasion?,139

157,Mr DREYFUS ,Isaacs) (9.04 pm)-I move: That the order of the day be referred to the Main Committee for debate. Question agreed to. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Urban Planning,139
158,Ms RISHWORTH ,"Kingston) (9.04 pm)-I move: That the House: (1) recognises the importance of sound urban planning for the long-term future of our towns and cities; (2) acknowledges that: (a) planning new communities and regenerating older communities must maximise the ‘liveability' of these communities; (b) local planning should ensure that: (i) local employment is available close to the local communities; (ii) transport options are well connected and integrated, including availability of public transport bike paths to reduce car dependency and promote healthy alternatives such as walking and cycling; (iii) housing and local infrastructure are designed to minimise the environmental footprint, including options to promote water and energy conservation; (iv) community services are available; and (v) local infrastructure facilitates a sense of community and place; and (c) urban planing of our communities must maximise the social, economic and environmental outcomes for local residents; and (3) urges all levels of government, industry, associated professions and the community to work together to ensure that we have healthy, happy, safe and sustainable communities. In moving this motion, I hope that the parliament will join me in recognising the importance that sound urban planning has for the future health and well-being of our cities, local communities and us as individuals. With the population of our cities growing and with the increasing demand for housing, our communities are faced with a challenge of how we best manage this need. The solution is much more complex than just allowing urban sprawl to continue. Rather, as the motion states, we must take the opportunity to develop communities that maximise the social, economic and environmental outcomes for local residents. This reflects the Planning Institute of Australia's principles on urban growth management, which begin by declaring: Any pattern of urban growth has social, economic and environmental implications that need to be considered and balanced in deciding the most desirable urban growth solution. This means, as the motion states, that the the planning of our new communities should and consider the availability of local employment, allowing for people to spend less time travelling to and from work and more time with their families. The motion also makes clear that considerations regarding the health of residents are essential. If we look at the ABS statistics in 2007-08 we find that they show that 68 per cent of all Australian men and 55 per cent of all Australian women are overweight or obese. This is an increase of five per cent since 1995. We need to think about how our town planning may affect every policy area, including health, and how we might address this issue of obesity in our society. People can be healthier and have a more enjoyable life with the best opportunities if they are at the forefront of planners' minds and considerations. This means ensuring that transport options connect people to their places of employment and their places of leisure. Transport options should include clean and green modes such as bike paths and public transport. They also mean making it easier for residents to go to local shops and services on foot. A well-designed community reduces its carbon footprint by reducing the amount of kilometres driven by each of its residents, in turn allowing residents to spend more time enjoying the things they like to do around their local community. On top of this, if people are not driving they are more likely to be walking or riding their bikes, which, as I said earlier, is far better for their health and the environment. As our suburbs keep expanding, as they are likely to do in Kingston, it is vitally important that we think about what we would like our new suburbs to look like. I know that the RMIT University is currently undertaking a 10-year research program titled ‘Reimagining the Australian suburb' and I look forward to reading more of their work, but we already know a number of key things. Our future suburbs need to be designed so that houses and communities minimise water consumption and to allow for the re-use of greywater and stormwater run-off. They need to be planned to minimise energy consumption in terms of lighting and other energy use. There are many local communities who are already choosing to take the lead on this. In my electorate of Kingston, residents of the Aldinga eco-village have prided themselves on their houses and their common community areas being both water and energy efficient. To make sure that we promote the well-being of our communities, we must plan to provide for community spaces, spaces for young and old sports teams to compete and places for families to enjoy and share activities with one another. Urban planning as an idea has a very short history, but if we do realise the ramifications of bad town planning then our communities will not sustain us into the future. I commend the motion to the House. (Time expired)",139
159,The DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Ms JA Saffin)-Is the motion seconded? Mr Dreyfus-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,141
160,Mr BRIGGS ,"Mayo) (9.09 pm)-I rise to join with the member for Kingston on this issue of town planning and support her motion. I understand she comes from an area which has significant planning issues. The Onkaparinga council-the city of Onkaparinga inches into my electorate-struggles with issues of planning in the southern suburbs of Adelaide. There are two issues I wish to deal with tonight with regard to planning. They relate to my electorate, Mount Barker and surrounds, Littlehampton and Nairne in particular. Some years ago, in 2000, the Heysen Tunnels opened in the Adelaide Hills on the Great Eastern Freeway, which opened up the Adelaide Hills significantly. That was the former member for Mayo's greatest achievement as the member for Mayo, he proudly boasts, and it certainly has created significant economic development in the Adelaide Hills, opened them up and changed the dynamic. However, it also brought an up-tick in growth-in Mount Barker, Nairne and Littlehampton in particular-which has brought with it considerable difficulties, with lagging infrastructure, roads, services and water. Water, of course, is a huge issue in my electorate. This has been a major concern for my constituents. It has a major impact on our ability to grow our own food. The Adelaide Hills produces not only some of the best wine in the country but also some of the best food. It is an important area for agriculture not and an area we must protect. With this fast expansion there has been a real impact on people's ability to continue to grow their own food. We have seen farmers tempted by offers from developers-as retirement packages, I guess-for their land. This has created an interesting dynamic, where there is now quite an anti-development feeling in Mount Barker and surrounding communities. The second issue I want to deal with is that of future growth in my area. It is an issue which the state member for Kavel, Mark Goldsworthy, has been following. I commend Mark for the work he has done. He recently surveyed the towns concerned, asking people's opinions on this issue, and received quite an extraordinary reaction, with about 1,500 survey respondents all very strongly raising concerns about the pace of development and the actions of the state government in relation to development. The state planning minister, Mr Holloway-who I think is an upper house member in the state parliament-said in our local newspaper, the Mount Barker Courier, which has also been pursuing this issue with some vigour, that the state government will have the final say about continuing development in the region. It is fair to say that that has enraged locals. Rather than locals and the council being considered and their views taken into account, the state government is just going to bulldoze its way through ordinary people and their views. That has caused an enormous amount of concern in my electorate. Development is a very contentious issue, particularly as it impacts on agricultural land, services, whether we have enough police, hospitals, health care and whether the roads are up to standard. Mount Barker is a country town that is now being turned into a dormitory suburb. This is a big issue, and I was disappointed with the action of the state government. I hope that they will reconsider the part of their plan-I think it is a 20-year planwhere they plan for Mount Barker, Littlehampton and Nairne to grow significantly. They should reconsider that. The people in my area want them to do so. What the state Labor minister said and did has been very unpopular. I think people accept that bulldozers are needed for development but they will not accept their opinion being bulldozed by the state Labor government. They need to reconsider this quickly. I know it is not an area that state Labor has traditionally put much emphasis on, up around Mount Barker, but it should not be treated as a second rate area because politically it is not important; it is very important to the Adelaide Hills and to South Australia. The Adelaide Hills retains a beauty and it should not just be turned into an outer dormitory suburb. (Time expired)",141
161,Mr DREYFUS ,"Isaacs) (9.15 pm)-As someone who is deeply interested in the future of our cities, and who believes that the forms of our cities play a critical role in the sorts of lives we are able to lead, I am pleased to support this motion. The forms our cities take are important. They have a profound influence on our economic prosperity, on the impact we have on our unique environment, on the level of social exclusion and inequality experienced in our communities and on the quality of life Australians and their families are able to enjoy. Well-thought out urban planning fosters the free flow of people and goods through major areas of economic activity and service delivery. Good urban planning connects communities with the labour markets, educational institutions and community networks needed in order for them to flourish. The great majority of Australians live in our major cities. You need only look to greater Melbourne or south-east Queensland to see the rapid expansion of our urban periphery. Our local community in my electorate of Isaacs, in Melbourne's south-east growth corridor, is part of that expansion. We have young families looking for affordable low-density housing in new estates in Keysborough, Sandhurst, Carrum Downs and Skye. We have retirees moving from family homes to smaller properties in newer, denser developments by the beach in Chelsea, Carrum and Mentone. We have the growing industrial areas in Dandenong South and Braeside. And in the middle of my electorate we have a large green wedge. Previous far-sighted planning has preserved this green wedge, which provides our community with a semirural area close to home. Urban policy in growth areas like my electorate demands careful planning for the needs of a community which is as diverse in age and occupation as it is in income and cultural heritage. Urban policy permeates every level of government involvement in public life. More than most other areas of policy, urban planning calls for an active role from government because we have a collective interest in the form of our cities. All governments have legitimate policy objectives in areas like economic prosperity, justice and environmental stability. These objectives can be facilitated by the structure of our cities or they can be ignored. Decisions about industry and innovation, migration, public transport, housing and infrastrucfederal ture all affect the form and function of our cities. To act as if urban planning is not a federal issue does not lessen its federal implications; it simply results in poor policy outcomes. Government must be involved in and must lead the planning of our cities. This extends to the federal government as well as to state and local governments. The Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government has created a major cities unit in his department. This major cities unit enables cities and agencies responsible for urban issues to have a single point of contact within the federal government. It is appalling that, for almost 12 years under the previous government, Australia had no Minister for Housing and no major cities strategy. We need to remember that the Labor government that left office in 1996 had created a Better Cities program and a Better Cities strategy, the objective of which was to address a number of challenges facing Australian cities. Those included rapid growth and a demand for infrastructure investment on the fringes of major cities, loss of population and under-use facilities and services in established urban areas and the increasing social, environmental and economic cost of poorly planned and managed cities. After the 12 years of inaction of the Howard government these are still among the challenges of urban planning that face Australia today. The Rudd government is responding to these challenges through the major cities unit and a coordinated whole-of-government approach to urban planning. Given the significance of urban planning to our economic prosperity and social structure, the future of social our cities demands national leadership, which the Rudd government is providing. I look forward, in the coming years, to seeing more being done at a federal level in relation to the urban fabric of our cities, because the government is in the position of being able to provide the leadership which is needed, the leadership that was sorely lacking during the whole of the period of the former Howard government.",142
162,Mr BILSON ,"Dunkley) (9.20 pm)-I rise to support the motion and the sentiment that has been put forward by the member for Kingston and acknowledge her interest in this area. I do say, though, that sentiment is no substitute for hard work and that words are no substitute for even harder work. And this area of public policy requires not only a lot of hard work but very extensive collaboration, because so many of the influences on successful cities are dispersed right across multiple levels of government-and, more importantly, across all the consumers, home purchasers, developers and investors, all looking at their interests as we in this national parliament look at the national interest. This is not something new, though. This issue has been with us for some time. The previous government certainly did more than apprise itself of these concerns. It set about doing something about them. In fact, in the of 2003-04 budget there was an urban environment initiative around sustainable cities. It touched on a number of issues concerning water quality, the information available within the community, air quality, renewable energy, waste management, the Year of the Built Environment, green buildings, a green car rating scheme, cycling facilities, air quality research, photovoltaic rebate schemes, chemical monitoring database, the National Pollutant Inventory-just to name a few. So this is not something that is particularly new. But it went further. I was pleased to chair the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage and undertake what was then viewed as a very seminal piece of research and a piece of important national leadership with the sustainable cities inquiry. This committee report was born out of my conviction, and that of the coalition government's side of the parliament, that the cities that we have may not be directly a consequence of federal government policy but, when they do not work well, it lands on the federal government to provide the remedies. The social hardship, the economic dislocation, the enormous commuter times, the cost in terms of environment and in terms of family pressure, the economic concerns and the vulnerability of people to movement in petrol prices and the like all come home to the federal government. With that in mind we thought, ‘What can we do now to outline a template for more sustainable cities into the future,' and this report did that. We led that debate and it welcomed unanimously right across the community and in a bipartisan sense. I was promoted into the ministry and did not have the privilege of finishing the final few paraplanning graphs-my friend and colleague Dr Mal Washer had that honour and distinction-but the report is still very much true to the work that we undertook. It talked about the key things that we need to look at in terms of sustainability: to recognise that more than three-quarters of GDP-the economic activity in Australia-happens in our cities; that the vast proportion of the population lives our cites; and to recognise the pressure on our environment, our consumption of resources and our future living standards. All these are interwoven in our cities. The report identified a range of areas of action about urban development and the role that the federal government could play in urban policy in trying to make sure that all decision making and funding was aligned to sustainability and better city objectives. It also looked at settlement patterns: what was happening in terms of dwelling sizes; the size of households; and the different models that were developing around the place and how they could be handled in a development assessment process that did not seek to tell people how and where they should livebecause that would be destined to fail-but would at least make it easier and more convenient for people to live with amenity and lifestyle and with ready access to those important elements of their lives that they wanted to be near to, and if they were not they would commute. A long time ago I drove a Mazda 808 super deluxe coupe, burnt orange-a great vehicle for its time-and at around 19 I stopped driving for pleasure and for the fun of it and started driving because I had to travel somewhere. I had a transport task. The mobility requirement was to move from was where I lived, to where I worked, to where I studied, to where I played sport and to where I undertook leisure activities. The key about more sustainable cities is not just better and better urban land use but it is also about integrating all of those areas of policy so that those key elements of people's lives are more within reach. We outlined an agenda for that in the sustainability report, but I do not have the time to go through that. I was pleased that our leader, Malcolm Turnbull, was a part of that committee in its later incarnations and continues to highlight in the importance of these issues. But I am drawn to something that Victorian senator Kim Carr said. He said that if you do not have a minister for cities and a minister for urban development you are not for real. Labor does not have a minister for cities and it does not have a minister for urban development. The opposition has a shadow minister for sustainable development and cities and, on the Kim Carr benchmark, the opposition is far more serious about taking the important action, not just recognising the problems and the challenges but putting in place the sound public policy. I fear that this will be an area where Labor quickly identifies and secures the political opportunities and the sound bytes and leaves the sound public policy and hard work to others. The coalition is up to that task; we have the policies and they will be revealed-(Time expired)",143
163,Mr ZAPPIA ,"Makin) (9.25 pm)-I begin by commending the member for Kingston for bringing this matter to the attention of House. I certainly will not use up the few minutes that I have responding to everything that was said by members opposite, but I noticed the member for Dunkley talked about the record of this government when it comes urban planning and I think it is like chalk and cheese when you compare it with the previous government. I want to specifically respond to something the member for Mayo said when he made some references to the state planning minister in South Australia, the Hon. Paul Holloway. Paul Holloway is in fact a very highly regarded and very competent planning minister and one who is held in the utmost respect by most of the developers and the people involved in planning in South Australia. I should also say that when it comes to the Hills Face area of South Australia, which is a very unique area and one that is of concern to a lot of South Australians, it was in fact Jay Wetherill, the planning minister prior to Paul Holloway, who implemented a freeze on planning and development in the Hills Face zone until a comprehensive community plan was developed for all of the Hills Face area. So, again, when it came to protecting our very valuable Hills Face area, it took a Labor government in South Australia to do that. I would like to make a number of observations with respect to this resolution. The first is that good planning is often taken for granted and sufficient recognition is not given to the importance that it plays in the again lives of people. Planning can have a very profound effect on the quality of the lives of people who live in any community, because that is where they spend their lives, it is where they interact with others and it is where their children attend school, sport and other activities. As a consequence, a person's life is very much influenced by the people they associate with. Local communities efthe fectively become an extension of one's own home. You can often become very attached to your local community, as we see frequently from the fact that people will live in the same area for pretty much all of their lives. And if you look at the statistics you will see that of those people who do move the majority do not move very far away from the original suburban area or community they grew up in. So it is a fact of life that the local community and the planning that goes into it can truly affect the quality of a person's life and the opportunities that are presented to them. Sometimes, regrettably, as a result of poor planning rather than a lack of opportunities, a person will find themselves in a situation where they are confronted by some very negative forces. Time will not permit me to elaborate on that but perhaps on another occasion I will. So good local area planning does make a drastic difference to the individual lives of people, to the environment, which we have heard other speakers talk about, and to the economic opportunities presented both to the individual and to the community as a whole. Critically, the areas of health and education outcomes can very much become reliant on good planning and good development. In recent times the term ‘sustainable communities' has often been used; it is an expression you hear quite frequently when you talk to planners. Conversely, governments around the world are now expending large sums of money rectifying and rebuilding poorly planned communities of earlier years. We have some good examples of that in South Australia, where the state government today is having to expend hundred of millions of dollars in order to rectify and rebuild communities that were built some 50 years ago and not properly planned out. One of the sad things that I hear too often is that there ought to be more land released for the purpose of building new homes. It is a view promoted by a number of housing developers. The problem with that is that housing developers may be very good at building houses but they are not necessarily so good at building communities, and there is a difference. Having a nice house without access to schools, shops, hospitals, sports clubs, parks, community hubs, universities, workplaces and so on can very much add to the cost of living and can lead to a much poorer quality of life for those people who live there. It is true that not all services ever be available in every community. But that is why transport systems have to be designed from the very outset. However, I accept that long-term area planning can never be perfect. (Time expired) ADJOURNMENT",145
164,The SPEAKER,"Order! It being 9.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Rural Fire Service Awards",146
165,Mr BALDWIN ,"Paterson) (9.30 pm)Tonight I rise to inform this House that on Saturday, 30 May, I attended a very special ceremony at the Bulahdelah Golf Club recognising the outstanding achievement of the members of the Great Lakes District brigades of the Rural Fire Service. I joined with former commissioner the Hon. Phil Koperberg; current Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons; Chief Superintendent Steve Yorke; Superintendent Kam Baker; Inspector Cecil Miller; and many members of the local brigades and their families to recognise these local heroes. The Great Lakes District is made up of 23 brigades comprising 687 members, with 46 firefighting vehicles and two support vehicles. The Great Lakes District brigades attended 283 incidents in 2008 and 121 incidents to date in 2009, with significant out of area assistance in the recent tragic bushfires in Victoria. The purpose of the event was to present nine National Medals, two First Clasp Awards, two Second Clasp Awards, one Third Clasp Award, 13 15-year long-service medals and 16 long-service awards to members of the Great Lakes District Rural Fire Service. The national medal is presented to members of the rural fire service in recognition of their years of diligent service that have gone above and beyond what is expected of active members within their brican gade. Long-service awards are presented to members of the Rural Fire Service in recognition of their years of active service. The recipients were Arthur Skinner, currently a member of the Tuncurry Catering Brigade, who received the National Medal and the First, Second and Third Clasp Awards for 59 years service; Norman Cunningham, currently a member of the Minimbah Brigade, who received the National Medal and the Second Clasp Award for 46 years service; Neal Cook, who received the National Medal for 25 years service as a member of the North Arm Cove Brigade; Kevin Johnson, who received the National Medal and the 15-year long-service award for 23 years service as a member of the Minimbah Brigade; Glyn Davies, who received the National Medal for 19 years service as a member of the Pacific Palms and Bungwahl Brigades; Brent Williams, who received the National Medal, the First Clasp Award and the 15-year long-service award for 18 years service as a member of the Minimbah Brigade; Dennis Webb, who received the National Medal and 15-year longservice award for 17 years service as ber of the Minimbah Brigade; Gladys Pearce, currently a member of the Great Lakes Communications Brigade, who received the National Medal for 17 years service; Phil MCAsey, who received the National Medal and 15-year long-service award for 16 years service as a member of the Green Point Brigade; Phil Hughes, who received the 15-year long-service award for 25 years service as a member of the North Arm Cove Point Brigade; Athol Blanch, who received the 15year long-service award for 21 years service as a member of the Limeburners Creek Brigade; Max Mehan, who received the 15-year long-service award for 21 years service as a member of the Limeburners Creek Brigade; Mark Rimmer, who received the National Medal and 15-year long-service award for 20 years service as a member of the Minimbah Brigade; Paul Murrell, who received the 15year long-service award for 20 years services as a member of the Green Point Brigade; Robert MCMaster, who received the 15-year long-service award for 18 years service as a member of the Minimbah Brigade; Kim MCDermott, who received the 15-year longservice award for 17 years service as a member of the Monkerai Brigade; Joe Karsenbarg, who received 15-year long-service award for 17 years service as a member of the Minimbah Brigade; Dennis Webb, who received the 15-year long-service award for 17 years service as a member of the Minimbah Brigade; Mark Johnson, who received the 15-year long-service award for 15 years service as a member of the Minimbah Brigade; John Murray, who received the 25-year long-service award for 31 years service as a member of the Limeburners Creek Brigade; Alan Witt, who received the 25-year longservice award for 31 years service as the Limeburners Creek Brigade; and Lowell Reardon, who received the 25-year longservice award for 27 years service as a mema mem- ber of the Green Point Brigade. These fine Australians and their fellow brigade members are our heroes. At a moment's notice, they regularly put their lives on the line to help people who they may not know to defend and save property that they do not own for a common bond that is uniquely Australian. This has been borne out in fighting fires not just across the region and not just across the state of New South Wales but indeed across all of Australia. They are not paid for their personal sacrifices, but they are truly respected and admired for them. To them and their families I, on behalf of this parliament, say thank you on a job well done. You serve your community and you serve your nation very well indeed. Delegation to Dharamsala",146
166,Mr DANBY ,"Melbourne Ports) (9.34 pm)-At the end of next week when the House rises for the winter break, I will have the great privilege of leading the first Australian parliamentary delegation to Dharamsala, in India. This is the seat of the Tibetan government in exile, headed by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, who will be celebrating his 74th birthday. The delegation will consist of me, the honourable member for Fremantle, the honourable member for Fisher, Senator Ludlam, Senator Hanson-Young and Senator Xenophon. I must stress at the outset that this will not be an official parliamentary delegation. We will not be representing the parliament, the government, the opposition or even our political parties. The all party parliamentary group for Tibet, which I chair, is not even an official parliamentary group. In a parliamentary sense, we will be representing only ourselves. But we will also be representing a very large number of Australians of all political persuasions who care about the freedom and human rights of oppressed nationalities. Ever since the Chinese invasion of 1950, the people of Tibet have been denied not only their national independence but also the freedom to practise their culture and religion-although I acknowledge that the situation has improved somewhat since the dark days of the Cultural Revolution in China. Yet, as we saw during the extensive disturbances in Tibet last year, the people of that country-particularly the younger generation-have not lost their desire for national and personal freedom. It is estimated that there are up to 500,000 Chinese troops in Tibet, a region with a Tibetan population of only two million people-although there are five million Tibetans who live in wider areas of the People's Republic of China. There has been a systematic effort to settle Tibet with Han Chinese migrants in the hope of swamping the Tibetans and extinguishing their culture. In Dharamsala, we will be meeting with the Dalai Lama, who is recognised by all Tibetans, inside and outside Tibet, as their national and spiritual leader. We will also meeting Professor Samdong Rinpoche, the Prime Minister of the Tibetan government in exile, who was elected by the world community of Tibetans in exile. I know that the Chinese Embassy in Australia told the Age last week that they had opposed our delegation's visit to Dharamsala as it would be an interference in Chinese sovereignty because we are supporting Tibetan independence. Let me say to this House, as I have said to successive Chinese ambassadors: I am not anti China. This delegation's visit to India is in no way an act hostility towards China. I wish nothing but happiness and prosperity for the great Chinese people. But, just as the Chinese people fought for many decades to free their country of foreign invaders and to re-establish their sovereignty, I hope our Chinese friends would understand that the people of Tibet wish to do the same for their country. There are 1.2 billion people in China. I find it hard to understand why they feel it necessary to deny self-government to a minority population of only five million in a remote area of their vast country. Many Chinese feel that they liberated Tibet from feudalism and they cannot understand why the Tibetans are not grateful for that. I am not here to defend the system that operated before 1950, but the Chinese themselves do not welcome changes brought to China by foreigners, even if those foreigners are well intentioned. When I was at university, I studied Marxism under a great professor, Dr Frank Knopfelmacher, who insisted that we read Das Kapital and the even more turgid Die Grundrisse. In those studies I learnt that one of the basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism is atheism, which is the official state ideology of China. It is very odd that a country with such an ideology would insist on appointing the spiritual second-in-command of the Dalai be Lama's religion. The Panchen Lama-the authentic one-was ‘disappeared' by agents of the Beijing regime when he was five years old. That is now many years ago. The Dalai Lama has said that he accepts the Chinese assertion that China has historically exercised sovereignty over Tibetalthough I note in passing that many historians in Tibet dispute this-and that he is willing to accept the same autonomous status that China has accepted for Hong Kong and Macau. I have to say that this seems a remarkably moderate position, given the sad of history of oppression in Tibet since 1950. I hope that the Chinese leadership will eventually have the wisdom to accept the Dalai Lama's proposal, although I do not expect it to happen soon. Some people say to me that Tibet is a lost cause. My reply is that I am old enough to have seen the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of apartheid, the demise of fascism in Spain and Communism in the Soviet Union and the establishment of independence in East Timor. I do not believe that any just cause is truly lost. The cause of the people of Tibet is a just case and one that I am proud to support. Hinkler Electorate: Hervey Bay",147
167,Mr NEVILLE ,"Hinkler) (9.39 pm)During the 2007 election, I campaigned on a commitment to secure $1.5 million to help build the much needed community centre for the fast growing city of Hervey Bay in my electorate. If ever there was a project that cried out to heaven for completion, it is this one. It is hard to believe that a city people does not already have a centre, but new infrastructure is actually the biggest social challenge that Hervey Bay faces at the moment. It has grown like topsy and continues to grow. Assistance from state and federal governments with infrastructure is critical. Unfortunately, Labor failed to match my commitment to the project, and it seems that the government has followed through by rejecting a regional community and local infrastructure program funding application for this project. In fact, my opponent at the last federal election would not even commit to it. On Friday, 22 May, I heard from the proponents, who were absolutely devastated that their high-quality application had been knocked back by the federal government. This project has a considerable history. Prior to the local government amalgamations in Queensland, Hervey Bay City Council committed $1 million and land to the project-a commitment later reaffirmed by the newly amalgamated Fraser Coast Regional Council. The Queensland government also made $1.5 million available to the project, and many service clubs in town have been actively fundraising for it. All that was missing was the Commonwealth contribution under the RLCIP criteria. The project fitted that criteria beautifully. The community centre would have been a hub for a number of social services for children and youth, as well as counselling, mentoring and referral services and other information outlets. These would be delivered by semi-government organisations and NGOs. The proponents had already developed a plan for construction, costs were completed and two weeks ago the building permit was lodged. This is a shovel-ready project. It is an environmentally keen project with a six-star rating. This would have helped to create jobs in Hervey Bay while also providing much needed civic infrastructure. It has now been left high and dry due to of 50,000 some bureaucratic decision. When we talk about vibrant regional communities, of course a robust local community is important. But what is also important in towns and cities are good places for people to live, where residents can enjoy quality of life and, if they fall into difficulties, be referred to proper services. One thing that is desperately needed in Hervey Bay is a community centre-a place where people can come together for assistance, support and guidance. I have spoken to a number of people about the funding knock-back and have given them an assurance that I will seek further information from the minister and the parliamentary secretary and that I will continue to fight to get Commonwealth funding. I put on the record the position that the community finds itself in, thanks to this decision. These words are direct quotes from a local resident-they are not mine. They state: Presently, services in our community are delivered in a hodge-podge of inaccessible facilities, some of which are of asbestos laden. Some people have access to emergency relief and others confidential services in parking lots, because they cannot fiscally get into a facility. services are forced to pay commercial scale rents, directly impacting on the level of service available to the homeless, the aged, challenged families and other targeted consumers. In a community that has almost nothing; where jobs are few and far between at the best of times, we stand to lose in excess of $2.5 million funding and a valuable community asset because the Commonwealth would not partner with us on this project. As news of this poor decision becomes publicly known, people in our community will be justifiably outraged. Bearing these words in mind, I urge the minister and the parliamentary secretary, who I might say have been very good to me to this point, to support this project and do the right thing for the people of Hervey Bay. Petition: Coral Sea Heritage Park",149
168,Mr TURNOUR ,"Leichhardt) (9.44 pm)I rise tonight to present a petition approved by the Standing Committee on Petitions. The petition has been organised by Mr Wayne Bayne, Mr Robert Erskine and other concerned citizens, who have since established the Coral Sea Access Alliance Group to campaign against the establishment of the Coral Sea Heritage Park as proposed by the Pew Environment Group. The Pew Environment Group's proposal would effectively ban fishing and a range of other uses in more than one million square kilometres of the Coral Sea. There have been 2,053 signatures collected in support of this petition. They are not in a format that allows them to be tabled tonight but I do have them here in my hand. Nine hundred signatures were collected in one night at a meeting I attended in Cairns, organised by Mr Bayne and local fishers. The Pew Coral Sea Heritage Park would effectively ban fishing in an area bordered by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and our maritime border with PNG, the Solomon Islands and New Caledonia. This, as I said, is Other an area of more than one million square kilometres of sea. The petition raises concerns about government actions ‘that will result in any usage restrictions, access or additional controls over the area known as the Coral Sea beyond those that exist under current legislation'. I have discussed the Pew proposal with a broad cross-section of the community and representative groups, including recreational and professional fishers, tourism representatives, the Super Yacht Group and environmental groups. This is a large and broad cross-section of local stakeholders and interest groups, as well as many members of the local community. The vast majority of people see the Pew proposal as extreme and an ambit claim to lock up the Coral Sea. I share this view and have discussed this with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, the Hon. Peter Garrett. Sadly, the Pew proposal has divided the community and has sought to pre-empt a bioregional planning process being undertaken by the Australian government. Since the petition was established, the environment minister has released the bioregional plan for the area and established a conservation zone covering the Coral Sea. I sought to ensure that any conservation zoning while the bioregional planning is proceeding would not impact on fishers in the Coral Sea. I am pleased that the minister has ensured that this has happened. The Pew group have not got their no-take zone and I will continue to fight any such proposal. Existing tourism operators and other commercial users of the area will have to obtain free permits to continue operating. Concerns about this permit process have been raised with me by the Coral Sea Access Alliance and I will be raising these with the minister. Yes, the government is moving forward with its bioregional planning process, including consultations on whether there needs to be increased protection in the area, but no final decision has been made. People do recognise that this is a valuable and important area and that there are areas that need to be protected, but we need to work through a proper process, which is what the Australian government is doing. I will continue working to ensure that fishing and other interests are considered in this process, as I did prior to the announcement of the conservation zone. There are consultation meetings in Cairns today and tomorrow as part of the bioregional planning process. This petition highlights concerns about government consultation processes when it comes to environmental issues and seeks to ensure that any consultations be ‘conducted transparently and not purely for the purpose of fulfilling a bureaucratic requirement'. In many ways people seem cynical about consultations, but it is very important that we do engage properly with the community about this process. I am committed to that. I can assure petitioners that I will be following with considerable interest these consultations and will continue to raise any issues and concerns with the minister. Finally, the petition raises concerns about foreign based groups-in this case, Pewinstigating Australian environmental policy. I can assure petitioners that the Pew Environment Group, funded out of the United States, is not in control of environmental planning in Australia. The bioregional planning process was instigated and begun under the former Howard government, following the establishment of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The Rudd government is moving forward with this bioregional planning and I would encourage all those with an interest in the Coral Sea to engage in the consultation processes constructively. I congratulate Mr Bayne, Mr Erskine and all of the 2,053 people who have signed these petitions in support for actively participating in our Australian democracy. I look forward to the parliament's response to this petition. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of the citizens of Australia. Draws to the attention of the House: Our concern over any possible actions by any government departments, ministers or government authorities that will result in any usage restrictions, access, or additional controls over the area known as The Coral Sea beyond those that exist under current legislation. We express considerable concern over several aspects of the PEW Foundation's proposal to establish the Coral Sea Heritage Park and demand that this proposal be dismissed immediately in its entirety. Public consultations on previous environmental issues have been extremely poorly advertised with little concern for the public opinions expressed. We therefore ask the House to: That any proposed environmental policies in Australia be instigated by Australian organisations and that Australian environmental policy be under the control of a duly elected Australian Government. In future we demand that the public consultation process be conducted transparently and not purely for the purpose of fulfilling a bureaucratic requirement. from 1 citizen Petition received. Coral Sea Heritage Park Herbert Electorate",150
169,Mr LINDSAY ,"Herbert) (9.49 pm)-I am pleased that the member for Leichhardt has raised this issue tonight and I would like to add my contribution in relation to it. I have long been on the public record calling for the expansion of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park to cover further coral reefs in that area. I have been particularly concerned about the impact on the shark fishery in that area. That is where there have been some very significant adverse effects from unscrupulous fishers, and the shark population should be better protected. I am hoping that will be an outcome of the current government's process in relation to the Coral Sea. Tonight I want to raise the issue of how Townsville people have been done in the eye by the Rudd government and I will give several examples. The member for Blair will know that I have Australia's largest defence base in my electorate, and we have had this conversation previously. I may bring 9 FSB up to Townsville, sir, so watch out! Standing at Lavarack Barracks on 12 November 2007, the current Prime Minister promised to increase defence spending by at least three per cent real annually to 2016. He said: We believe that those in uniform, our men women in uniform who serve our country with distinction deserve that level of certainty … Yet the heart of Labor's Pappas review into defence was to slash spending. In the 200910 budget, Defence has been required to make $20 billion worth of savings over 10 years. It is a case of the Rudd government giving with one hand and then taking back with the other. Then there is the other broken promise, which was particularly felt in my electorate of Herbert, where the Prime Minister and the shadow minister for defence at the time indicated that the first of the new family medical centres that Labor were promising would be opened in both Townsville and Darwin. Well, neither Townsville nor Darwin has received a family medical centre but other centres have. It is a clear broken promise in relation to the Australian Defence Force. Look at the promise of the national broadband network. In March 2001 Mr Rudd said: We're proposing to invest up to $4.7 billion in this proposal … Mr Rudd also promised that it would be commenced in late 2008. Now there is a new plan, and the new plan will not cost $4.7 billion but $43 billion. The promise was that construction would commence by late 2008-yet another broken promise. There has been no construction commenced and we will not likely see any construction for some time. My community of Magnetic Island, near Townsville, is not even going to be covered by the national broadband network. That is quite extraordinary for a community like Magnetic Island. In relation to roads, the Douglas arterial received $55 million to become four lanes in the budget before last. Do you know how much work has been done on that four-laning project? None. We do not even know when it might start. The ring road is finished but the and four-laning of the Douglas arterial, which was to take the extra volume of traffic generated by the ring road, does not even have a commencement date at this stage, yet it is supposed to be and is touted as being a nation-building project. How can it be a nationbuilding project if it is not being built? In relation to private health insurance, in a letter to the Australian Health Insurance Association on 20 November 2007, Kevin Rudd said: Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates. Never was an election promise given so emphatically and then broken so brazenly. It has had such a terrible flow-on into the public hospital system and the private hospital system in Townsville, but that is another story for another day. On ABC TV on Wednesday night the Prime Minister, under pressure from unions wanting the abolition of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner, was very quick to say: We will be adhering to our pre-election commitment. I take absolutely seriously my commitment to the Australian people prior to the last I just wish he would ‘take absolutely seriously' all of his other commitments. Labor keep election promises when it suits them and break them when it does not. The Australian people cannot ever again trust what the Australian Labor Party tells them. Mr Herbert Morton Olm",151
170,Mr NEUMANN ,"Blair) (9.54 pm)-I am speaking tonight about a remarkable individual. His name is Herbert Morton Olm. He was born at Ropeley in the Lockyer Valley on 7 August 1908. He is still with us. He is a much loved and respected and popular figure in the Laidley Tabeel aged-care home. Until recently he lived on the family farm at Ropeley with the support of his family. His grandson Joshua works for me as an electorate officer and is the treasurer of my branch of the ALP, the Raceview Flinders branch in Ipswich. Herb is an interesting character. Herb joined the Labor Party in 1930. He would have joined earlier but in Queensland at that stage you had to wait until you were 21 to join the Labor Party. In Queensland now you can join the Labor Party at 15 years of age. He was made a life member of the party in 1978. In 1936 he married the love of his life, Maud, and they were blessed with eight children and many grandchildren and greatgrandchildren. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace in 1934, one of only three in Gatton at the time, and he is Queensland's longest serving JP. The most remarkable thing about his life is this: he lived all his life in the Lockyer Valley, which has always been a fairly conservative area. It is part of my electorate but traditionally it has voted conservative. He has been involved in many cooperative and society activities in the Lockyer Valley and is a Lockyer legend. In fact, the former conservative state member for Lockyer described him as a one of the 10 most imporelection. tant people in the Lockyer Valley. One of the most interesting things about Herb is that in 1960 he managed to convince a very young police officer called Bill Hayden that he should run for the seat of Oxley. Oxley was created in 1949 and held by the then health minister, Don Cameron. Oxley had existed before, but it had been renamed Griffith in 1934. But it had never been held by the Labor Party. Bill won it with a remarkable swing of 9.4 per cent. Herb took nine months off from the family farm to go full-time campaigning with Bill Hayden. Herb wrote many speeches. Bill was a young fellow and he had Dallas with him in an old car and they drove around all over the place. Herb introduced Bill to many farmers, cattlemen and people involved in all kinds of activities in the Lockyer Valley. On Herb's 100th birthday, Bill Hayden spoke movingly and brilliantly at the Gatton Shire Hall. Many people were there, including the Minister for Ageing, Justine Elliot. There were messages from all and sundry, from political leaders and one from the Queen. The mayor of the Lockyer Valley Regional Council was there, and I was honoured to be there among the 160 people. Bill attributed much of the swing that he got in 1961 to Herb. He spoke almost tearfully about what Herb had done for him: the mentoring, the advice, the counselling, the people Herb had introduced him to. His sage help was invaluable in Bill winning in 1961. I have Bill's old seat and it is very much as it was in 1961, except I have got Boonah instead of Esk. People like Herb who have lived all their lives campaigning and being involved in community activities like Blue Care and many other voluntary things should be honoured. We should cherish them. People like Herb are not just an institution and a legend in the Lockyer Valley; they are to be admired and respected. His generation is a great generation. His contribution to political life and community life in the Lockyer Valley cannot be underestimated. I want to pay tribute to Herb and thank him for his generational contribution: now his grandson is helping me and his family has been involved in helping run Labor Party campaigns and helping the cause of the labour movement for generations. Thank you, Herb, for the life you have lived. Thank you for what you have done for me, Bill Hayden and all those people who hold the principles of the Labor Party and the labour movement so dear. Well done, Herb. Question agreed to. House adjourned at 9.59 pm",153

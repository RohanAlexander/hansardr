NA,DEATH OF DR. L. W. NOTT.,12
NA,"Mr EBIC J. HARRISON,-Honor -",12
NA,able members are aware of .the tragic,12
NA,"passing of Dr L. W. Nott, who was the",12
NA,first member of this House for the,12
NA,"Australian Capital Temtory, and a",12
NA,citizen of renown. T am sure that many,12
NA,houorable members would wish to take,12
NA,the opportunity to pay a tribute to his,12
NA,memory by . attending his funeral,12
NA,"service this afternoon. For that reason,",12
NA,"I suggest to you, Mr Speaker, that i t",12
NA,is the desire of honorable members that,12
NA,you leave the chair until 4 o'clock.,12

NA,Mr ALLA N FRASER - I desire to,12
NA,ask a question of the Vice-President of,12
NA,"the Executive Council, and to explain it",12
NA,by referring to the case of a Goulburn,12
NA,lad whose parents were unable to keep,12
NA,"him at school but who, by working for",12
NA,"several years, was able to earn enough",12
NA,money to pay his way through high,12
NA,"school. This year, at the age of 21, he is",12
NA,"sitting for his leaving certificate, and my",12
NA,question relates to ths eligibility of a lad,12
NA,of that 'age to compete for a Common-,12
NA,wealth university scholarship. At first,12
NA,"this lad WRS declared to be ineligible, but",12
NA,I made representations to the Prime,12
NA,"Minister, who, in turn, intervened",12
NA,"with the University Commission, with -",12
NA,the result that the lad has been,12
NA,given eligibility. I n conveying my,12
NA,thanks to the Prime Minister for his,12
NA,"kindly and humane intervention, I ask the",12
NA,Vice-President of the Executive Council,12
NA,whether he will ask the right honorable,12
NA,gentleman to examine the rules govern-,12
NA,ing Commonwealth university scholar-,12
NA,ships with a view to having thdin,12
NA,liberalized so as to cover cases of tlie,12
NA,kind to which I havo referred?,12
NA,Mr EEIC J. HARRISON - I shall,12
NA,see that the honorable member's question,12
NA,is brought to the notice of the responsible,12
NA,"Minister, aud I have no doubt that action",12
NA,will be taken along lines suggested.,12
NA,POSTAL DEPARTMENT.,12
Mr GEORGE LAWSON ,I s the,12
NA,Postmaster-General aware that grave,12
NA,discontent exists among members of,12
NA,the staff of telegraphists employed,12
NA,in his department at the Brisbane General,12
NA,Post Office? Is he also aware that in all,12
NA,States except Queensland telegraphists,12
NA,are allowed a respite of ten or twelve,12
NA,"minutes when rostered on certain shifts,",12
NA,as this is regarded by the Director-,12
NA,General as essential to health ? Will the,12
NA,Postmaster-General see that telegraphists,12
NA,in Queensland are given tho same health,12
NA,"respite, when rostered on certain shifts,",12
NA,is enjoyed by telegraphists in other,12
NA,States?,12
Mr ANTHONY , I a m>,12
NA,not fully,12
NA,acnuainted with the conditions under,12
NA,p.m. which telegraphists work at the General,12
NA,"Post-Office in Brisbane, but I shall have",12
NA,the matter examined.,12
Mr FAIRBAIRN ,Ca n the Post-,13
NA,master-General state the approximate,13
NA,cost of issuing each new design of,13
NA,stamp ? I n view of the need for economy,13
NA,"in government departments, does he",13
NA,believe that a worthwhile saving would,13
NA,be effected by keeping to the one design?,13
Mr ANTHONY , I do not think that,13
NA,a worthwhile saving would be effected,13
NA,by keeping to one design. I t is the cus-,13
NA,tom of all postal administrations through-,13
NA,out the world to issue a number of stamps,13
NA,of varying design in the course of each,13
NA,year. Although it costs between £600,13
NA,and £800 for the work of engraving and,13
NA,"the making of dies for each new design,",13
NA,the profit reaped from the activities of,13
NA,philatelists alone very considerably ex-,13
NA,ceeds the cost. Many people throughout,13
NA,the world buy stamps of each new design,13
NA,"but never use them for postal purposes,",13
NA,so that the price of the stamps represents,13
NA,clear profit to the department. I n some,13
NA,parts of the world postal authorities raise,13
NA,considerable revenue by issuing new-,13
NA,stamps about once a month. New-,13
NA,stamps will be issued next year in con-,13
NA,nexion with the visit of Princess,13
NA,Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh.,13
NA,The issues that had been planned pre-,13
NA,viously had to be cancelled because of,13
NA,the changed arrangements for the Eoyal,13
NA,tour. The Australian postal adminis-,13
NA,tration usually issues about four new sets,13
NA,of stamps each year.,13
NA,DEFENCE.,13
Mr BRUCE ,Wil l the Minister for,13
NA,Defence give consideration to the estab-,13
NA,lishment of adequate permanent defence,13
NA,"installations in northern Queensland,",13
NA,which was our first point of contact with,13
NA,the enemy during World War II.?,13
Mr MCBRIDE ,Defenc e problems,13
NA,are constantly exercising the minds of the,13
NA,"defence authorities and the Government,",13
NA,ahd the honorable member's request will,13
NA,receive consideration.,13
NA,RAYON.,13
Mr WIGHT ,Ca n the Minister repre-,13
NA,senting the Minister for Trade and Cus-,13
NA,toms inform the House whether the ter-,13
NA,mination of the by-law concessions on,13
NA,"woven rayon piece goods, announced by",13
NA,the Minister for Trade and Customs last Australian,13
NA,"week, is restricted to woven rayon piece",13
NA,goods that are classified as finished cloth,13
NA,"only, or whether action is being taken",13
NA,also to restrict the volume of grey cloth,13
NA,"that is imported under by-law, printed in",13
NA,Australia and sold as Australian rayon,13
NA,in unfair competition with rayon that is,13
NA,wholly woven and finished in Australia ?,13
Mr SPEAKER ,Th e question should,13
NA,go on the notice-paper.,13
NA,Mr ERIC J. HARRISON - I have no,13
NA,"personal knowledge of this subject, but",13
NA,I shall have the question referred to the,13
NA,"Minister for Trade and Customs, who",13
NA,will provide the honorable member with,13
NA,a reply.,13
NA,BROADCASTING.,13
Mr KEON ,I s the Postmaster-,13
NA,General aware that overseas newspaper,13
NA,interests have recently purchased a chain,13
NA,of broadcasting stations in New South,13
NA,Wales? Is there any bar to overseas,13
NA,interests controlling those broadcasting,13
NA,"stations? I f not, will the Government",13
NA,give consideration to the introduction of,13
NA,legislation to prevent overseas bodies of,13
NA,any sort from controlling means of public,13
NA,information in Australia?,13
Mr ANTHONY , I understand that,13
NA,"certain overseas interests have acquired,",13
NA,"or are in the process of acquiring, a cer-",13
NA,tain Australian broadcasting network.,13
NA,The transaction relates not necessarily to,13
NA,broadcasting licences but to stations that,13
NA,control certain licences. I think that the,13
NA,matter will require examination in the,13
NA,light of the suggestion that the lionorable,13
NA,"member has made, with a view to deter-",13
NA,mining the degree to which overseas,13
NA,interests should be permitted to acauire,13
NA,rights in Australian broadcasting stations.,13
NA,This matter raises a new problem. I t is,13
NA,not dealt with in the existing legislation,13
NA,and does not seem to have been envisaged,13
NA,when that legislation was being con-,13
NA,sidered by the Parliament. I n view of the,13
NA,"circumstances that have arisen, special",13
NA,attention is now being directed to this,13
NA,"aspect of Australian broadcasting, and",13
NA,consideration will be given to the sugges-,13
NA,tion that the honorable member has made.,13
NA,Mr ALLA N FRASER -Wil l the,13
NA,Postmaster-General say whether it is a,13
NA,fact tbat the capital being invested in the,13
NA,commercial broadcasting,13
NA,system is British and not foreign? Has,13
NA,there been any change in the attitude of,14
NA,welcoming the investment of British capi-,14
NA,tal in Australian enterprises ? Is it,14
NA,that a number of trading banks which,14
NA,exercise considerable control over the,14
NA,financing of Australian industry are,14
NA,operated by overseas capital and con-,14
NA,trolled by overseas directors? Does the,14
NA,Postmaster-General's answer to the ques-,14
NA,tion asked by the honorable member for,14
NA,Yarra indicate that the Government is,14
NA,considering limiting the investment of,14
NA,British capital in this British country or,14
NA,that it is proposing to take a severer view,14
NA,of the investment of British capital in an,14
NA,Australian enterprise with Australian,14
NA,"directors, than it does of the indirect",14
NA,investment through the banking system,14
NA,which is controlled both by overseas,14
NA,finance and overseas directors?,14
Mr ANTHONY ,M y reply to the,14
NA,honorable member for Yarra indicated,14
NA,that when the Australian Broadcasting,14
NA,"Act was passed, the possibility that over-",14
NA,seas interests would endeavour to secure,14
NA,control of Australian broadcasting,14
NA,stations was apparently not envisaged. I n,14
NA,"my view, there is quite a difference",14
NA,between the investment of overseas capital,14
NA,in Australian industries and the use of,14
NA,such capital to secure control of an instrutralian,14
NA,ment of publicity and propaganda within,14
NA,Australia. To. permit the use of foreign,14
NA,capital in that way without hindrance,14
NA,would be detrimental to the national,14
NA,"interests. I am speaking now, not of",14
NA,"British capital particularly, but of",14
NA,foreign capital. British investment,14
NA,might be a matter for further considera-,14
NA,"tion, but I think the position requires",14
NA,careful scrutiny.,14
NA,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR EORCE.,14
Mr GRAHAM ,I n view of the fact,14
NA,that ill-informed and misguided reports,14
NA,and leading articles were published,14
NA,"some newspapers recently, will the",14
NA,ter for Air indicate the degree to which,14
NA,the Australian Government is seeking to,14
NA,purchase from overseas markets modern,14
NA,aircraft for the Royal Australian Air,14
NA,"Force, and inform the House of what has",14
NA,been achieved in that connexion?,14
Mr MCMAHON , T am unable to the,14
NA,give details of what is being done by,14
NA,Australian Government to purchase airunderstand,14
NA,craft and aircraft equipment from over-,14
NA,seas. We have procurement agencies in,14
NA,a fact the United Kingdom and the United,14
NA,States of America. Those agencies are,14
NA,endeavouring to obtain from overseas the,14
NA,requirements of the Royal Australian Air,14
NA,Force that cannot be supplied by local,14
NA,production. I do not want to say now,14
NA,how much equipment has been obtained,14
NA,"from overseas, but the quantity is not",14
NA,great. Aircraft and aircraft equipment,14
NA,are coming forward in dribs and drabs.,14
NA,"We hope that, in the future, supplies will",14
NA,be increased to some degree. Our pros-,14
NA,pects of obtaining aircraft and aircraft,14
NA,equipment from overseas are not good,14
NA,now and will not be good for at least two,14
NA,years.,14
NA,INDUSTRIAL ARBITRATION.,14
Mr ROSEVEAR , Recently I,14
NA,directed to the Minister for Labour and,14
NA,National Service a question about an,14
NA,application to the Commonwealth Arbi-,14
NA,tration Court by certain employers',14
NA,organizations for the restoration of a,14
NA,44-hour working week. I n the course of.,14
NA,my question I directed the attention of,14
NA,the honorable gentleman to a press report,14
NA,in which it was suggested that the Aus-,14
NA,Government proposed to interest,14
NA,itself in the application and to be repre-,14
NA,sented at the hearing before the court. Is,14
NA,the Minister now able to inform me,14
NA,whether the Commonwealth intends to,14
NA,"interest itself in tbe case, the hearing of",14
NA,which will commence this week? I f that,14
NA,"be the intention of the Government, will",14
NA,the Ministers say whether the Common-,14
NA,wealth will be represented by counsel and,14
NA,join with the employers' organizations in,14
NA,advocating the restoration of a 44-hour,14
NA,week ?,14
Mr HOLT , I understand that at a,14
NA,hearing before the Chief Judge of the,14
NA,Commonwealth Arbitration Court yester-,14
NA,in day a number of matters were raised.,14
NA,MinisSome related to applications by em-,14
NA,ployees' associations for a shorter work-,14
NA,ing week and others related to applications,14
NA,by employers' organizations for a longer,14
NA,working week. During the hearing the,14
NA,"Chief Judge, with the authority of his",14
NA,"brother judges, asked representatives of",14
NA,"r>art""'es to meet him in his chambers",14
NA,"the on Wednesday, the 21st November. I",14
NA,that he made i t clear that he,14
NA,did not want interveners to be present,15
NA,that meeting. I think that wbat he has,15
NA,in mind is to ascertain the intentions of,15
NA,"the parties. At this stage, the question",15
NA,intervention by the Commonwealth,15
NA,"not arise, and it will not do so until",15
NA,intentions of the parties to the applicaservice,15
NA,tions before the court have been further,15
NA,clarified.,15
NA,ALIEN DOCTORS.,15
Mr JOSHUA ,Wil l the Minister,15
NA,for Immigration say wliether he has been,15
NA,considering a plan under which some,15
NA,immigrant doctors will be permitted,15
NA,practice medicine in Australia without,15
NA,"having undergone, as they are now",15
NA,"required to do, training for three years",15
NA,an Australian university? I f he is,15
NA,"sidering such a plan, will he indicate",15
NA,it is proposed to do to ensure that students,15
NA,who have undertaken a six-year course,15
NA,medicine at Australian universities shall,15
NA,not be planed at a disadvantage because,15
NA,competition by immigrant doctors?,15
Mr HOLT ,Th e Commonwealth is,15
NA,not in a position to determine any plan,15
NA,regard to this matter. The registration,15
NA,of medical practitioners is a matter,15
NA,determination by State governments. As,15
NA,"far as I am aware, most States have legisstitute",15
NA,lation which deals with that matter.,15
NA,are conferring vvith representatives of,15
NA,British Medical Association with a view,15
NA,to ascertaining what can be done to,15
NA,the best use of the talents of medical,15
NA,in this country who were trained,15
NA,"European countries. ' We have.had disOrganization,",15
NA,cussions also with the State Premiers.,15
NA,do not think there is any danger that,15
NA,rights and opportunities of Australian,15
NA,medical students will be endangered in,15
NA,any way by the registration of a a representative,15
NA,limited number of medical men from to,15
NA,overseas. I shall give a more detailed,15
NA,reply to the honorable gentleman when,15
NA,have more information upon this matter,15
NA,at my disposal.,15
NA,IMMIGRATION .,15
Mr EGGINS ,"'M y question, which is",15
NA,"directed to the Minister for Immigration,",15
NA,relates to tbe very serious need for addifacilities,15
NA,tional experienced rural labour in counsuch,15
NA,try industries. Having regard to existGovernment,15
NA,"ing immigration requirements, it is",15
NA,ahnost necessary for primary producers,15
NA,at to nominate persons to be brought to this,15
NA,country for employment in rural indus-,15
NA,"tries, with all the delay and cost that such",15
NA,"of a course involves, and with no guarantee",15
NA,does that on arrival in Australia sueh,15
NA,the nominated immigrants will remain in the,15
NA,of their nominators. Has the,15
NA,Minister any proposal in mind that will,15
NA,assist in making available to country,15
NA,"areas added numbers of immigrants with,",15
NA,experience in rural industries?,15
Mr HOLT , I have previously inti-,15
NA,mated to the House the concern that the,15
NA,Government feels about the need for a,15
NA,to very much greater proportion of our,15
NA,immigrant intake to go into rural produc-,15
NA,tion than is the case at present. I t is,15
NA,at true that until now the facilities avail-,15
NA,conable to persons in Australia to bring,15
NA,what immigrant labour into rural production,15
NA,have been limited very largely to the,15
NA,in nomination scheme. As the honorable,15
NA,"member has pointed out, it is not always",15
NA,of practicable to ensure that persons so,15
NA,nominated will remain on the properties,15
NA,to which they were brought in the first,15
NA,in instance. The problem has been referred,15
NA,by me to the Immigration Planning,15
NA,"for Council. I understand that that body,",15
NA,"at its most recent meeting, decided to con-",15
NA,a committee to inquire into the,15
NA,We problem as a matter of urgency. The,15
NA,the committee will include in its member-,15
NA,ship such well-known figures as Professor,15
NA,"make Wadham and Mr W. S. Kelly, who have",15
NA,men been associated with the Commonwealth,15
NA,in Scientific and Industrial Research,15
NA,and also representatives of,15
NA,"I thc Department of Immigration, the",15
NA,the Department of Labour and National Ser-,15
NA,vice and the Bureau of Agricultural.,15
NA,Economics. I am also considering inviting,15
NA,of the rural organizations,15
NA,participate in the committee's discus-,15
NA,sions. Tt. would be of considerable assis-,15
NA,I tance to the Government if organizations,15
NA,that represent rural industries would,15
NA,"themselves, as far as it is practicable for",15
NA,"them to do so, ascertain from their",15
NA,members the likely demand for rural,15
NA,labour. I f we can obtain from the rural,15
NA,groups a clearer indication than we have,15
NA,had of their need for labour and the,15
NA,"that they can make available,",15
NA,"as accommodation and the like, the",15
NA,will be able to establish a,15
NA,more clearly defined target to aim at in,15
NA,formulating its immigration plans. I n,16
NA,tbe preliminary plans for the intake of,16
NA,immigrants nest year a very much larger,16
NA,proportion of immigrants will be chosen,16
NA,for rural production than has been the,16
NA,case this year.,16
Mr WILSON ,I n view of the urgent,16
NA,"need for increased food production, will",16
NA,the Minister for Immigration consider,16
NA,"the erection in rural areas of small hostels,",16
NA,"to accommodate, say, eight families, tc",16
NA,house immigrants who could farm 8 to 10,16
NA,"acres of land in their spare time, in addi-",16
NA,tion to retaining their normal employ-,16
NA,ment? I consider that the food situation,16
NA,in his country is so urgent that we need a,16
NA,"certain amount of peasant farming,",16
NA,which could be carried out in conjunction,16
NA,with the present employment of many,16
NA,new Australians.,16
Mr HOLT ,A s I have already inti-,16
NA,"mated to the House, we are conscious of",16
NA,the need for the intensive cultivation of,16
NA,"certain kinds of agricultural products,",16
NA,an increase of the production of which,16
NA,is obviously necessary i f our population,16
NA,is to grow and i f we are to be able to,16
NA,meet our domestic needs and also help,16
NA,to supply the requirements of countries,16
NA,such as the TJnited Kingdom. I shall,16
NA,consider the honorable gentleman'e,16
NA,suggestion. I know that he has given,16
NA,a good deal of thought to this problem.,16
NA,"I point out, however, that one of",16
NA,our difficulties at the present time,16
NA,is that the level of public works that,16
NA,were being carried out by this Govern-,16
NA,ment and State governments has been,16
NA,such that i t has added to our problem,16
NA,"of inflation. Consequently, the Govern-",16
NA,ment has found it necessary to reduce its,16
NA,works programme for the current year.,16
NA,"I n the result, the construction of certain",16
NA,immigrant hostels which had been,16
NA,planned for country districts has had to,16
NA,be deferred. The practicability of con-,16
NA,tinuing with the construction of such,16
NA,"hostels in country areas will, to some",16
NA,"degree, be affected by the progress of the",16
NA,"public works programme. However, I",16
NA,shall see whether I can give a more,16
NA,dctailod statement to the honorable mem-,16
NA,ber after I have considered his suggestion.,16
Mr ROSEVEAR , I desire to ask the,16
NA,Minister for Immigration whether diffi-,16
NA,culty is experienced in securing immi-,16
NA,grants from Great Britain and Europe,16
NA,because the rural and building industries,16
NA,of those countries need to retain their,16
NA,labour for their own development? Will,16
NA,the Government explore the possibilities,16
NA,of securing immigrants from the North,16
NA,American continent? I understand that,16
NA,there is a large number of unemployed,16
NA,"people, in the TJnited States at present",16
NA,and it may be possible to bring white,16
NA,"people here from that country and, per-",16
NA,haps from Canada.,16
Mr HOLT ,Fro m the information,16
NA,available to me it would appear that there,16
NA,are still many people in Europe who,16
NA,would be suitable for rural work and who,16
NA,would be glad to come to Australia under,16
NA,suitable conditions. That is not so. in,16
NA,the TJnited Kingdom where there is a,16
NA,shortage of agricultural labour. The,16
NA,Government has been endeavouring to,16
NA,attract as many immigrants as possible,16
NA,from those European countries in which,16
NA,they are available. I should not think,16
NA,that we would meet with much,16
NA,success in endeavouring to attract,16
NA,immigrants from Canada because that,16
NA,country is developing very rapidly and is,16
NA,actively engaged in a programme of,16
NA,immigration in order to assist it in its,16
NA,own work of development. I agree with,16
NA,the honorable member that there should,16
NA,be possibilities of obtaining immigrants,16
NA,"from the TJnited States, yet, from time to",16
NA,time special efforts are made by the,16
NA,"United States, particularly when seasonal",16
NA,"labour is required, to bring people",16
NA,there from South African countries,16
NA,"such as Puerto Rico. However, I have",16
NA,always considered that with adequate,16
NA,"publicity, and provided that shipping was",16
NA,"available, Australia could attract a num-",16
NA,ber of people from the United States. I,16
NA,discussed this matter informally with a,16
NA,representative of an American shipping,16
NA,company this morning. The Govern-,16
NA,ment would be glad to welcome citizens,16
NA,from the United States of America to,16
NA,Australia and I am sure that they would,16
NA,make admirable settlers.,16
NA,HOUSING.,16
Mr ANDREWS ,Followin g upon in-,16
NA,quiries that have been addressed to me,16
NA,"by some of my electors, I ask the Minis-",16
NA,ter for Social Services whether his.,16
NA,department is prepared to take over,16
NA,mortgages on war service homes being,16
NA,constructed under co-operative housing,17
NA,"schemes, to the maximum extent of",17
NA,"£2,750, which is the figure that applies",17
NA,to the homes now under construction?,17
Mr TOWNLEY ,Ne w legislation in,17
NA,connexion with war service homes and,17
NA,proposed amendments to the existing,17
NA,legislation are now before the House.,17
NA,"The debate on that measure will, I con-",17
NA,"sider, provide a more convenient and",17
NA,appropriate opportunity than the present,17
NA,for a discussion of the matter that the,17
NA,honorable member has raised. Such,17
NA,housing schemes as the honorable member,17
NA,has mentioned have their own singular,17
NA,"and peculiar commitments, and i f the",17
NA,honorable member will let rae have the,17
NA,details of the particular scheme that he,17
NA,is interested in I shall be pleased to let,17
NA,him have a reply to his question.,17
NA,TELEPHONE SEEVICES.,17
Mr BOSTOCK ,I n view of the desired,17
NA,difficulty which is being experienced by honorable member.,17
NA,many intending subscribers to the tele-,17
NA,phone system in country areas and,17
NA,of the unsatisfactory telephone com-,17
NA,munications that exist in certain coun-,17
NA,try areasI ask the Postmasterof,17
NA,General to indicate whether the procureconcern,17
NA,ment of automatic telephone switchthroughout,17
NA,boards is progressing satisfactorily?,17
NA,"general, will he indicate what progress",17
NA,is being made with the plan to install,17
NA,"rural automatic telephone exchanges,",17
NA,particularly in Victoria?,17
Mr ANTHONY ,W e have on order,17
NA,about 750 rural automatic exchanges,17
NA,which have been coming forward in the,17
NA,normal way. The rate of supply is only,17
NA,"about 100 or 150 a year, which is also dates back to 1904.",17
NA,the rate at which we have the technical,17
NA,means to carry out installations. These not Mr.aware,17
NA,exchanges are being installed according,17
NA,to schedule.,17
Mr WARD ,I n view of the repeated,17
NA,statements b.y the Postmaster-General to,17

NA,an additional rate of tax of 2s. in the f 1,19

NA,Certain exemptions from this special,19

NA,-,19
NA,in respect of dividends included in the,19
NA,"taxable income. The omission to"" provide",19
NA,for this exemption in the motion was,19
NA,due to inadvertence - .. .,19
NA,The dividends which the amendment,19
NA,proposes to exempt from the.special levy,19
NA,will generally be paid out of profits sub-,19
NA,"jected to that levy, and it would be in-",19
NA,appropriate to impose the levy a second,19
NA,"when dividends are paid. Moreover,",19
NA,the severity of the total burden of tax on,19
NA,the nrofits aiid on the* dividends paid ov^t,19
NA,of those pronts would be a serious deter-,19
NA,- rent to the investment of overseas capital,19
NA,by means of subsidiary companies operat-,19

NA,A corresponding freedom from the,20
NA,special levy in the case of dividends paid,20
NA,to companies resident in Australia is,20
NA,achieved through the allowance of the tax,20
NA,rebate already provided for by the income,20

NA,will establish uniformity in this regard,20
NA,between resident and non-resident com-,20
NA,panies.,20
NA,Amendment agreed to.,20
NA,Hr. TOM BURKE .(Perth) [4.45]:- - of,20
NA,The object of the motion is to give,20
NA,effect to the increases of the rates of,20
NA,that have besn outlined in the budget.,20
NA,The Opposition believes that the proapproximately,20
NA,cedure that the Government now proposes,20
NA,to follow is inequitable and that i t will,20
NA,not achieve the results that the Governcreased,20
NA,ment claims that its financial policy,20
NA,been designed to achieve. The Governof,20
NA,"ment proposes, first, to impose a flat",20
NA,"increase of 10 psr cent, on all taxable",20
NA,incomes derived from personal exertion.,20
NA,I t thereby proposes to abandon all,20
NA,ordinary principles of taxation that have,20
NA,been observed in the past. Although,20
NA,under 'this flat rate increase taxpayers,20
NA,"will pay varying amounts, the increase",20
NA,will be in the same proportion in respect,20
NA,of all incomes from ths lowest to the,20
NA,highest ranges. Such a procedure is in-,20
NA,"equitable, and it is wrong in practice.",20
NA,The Opposition urges the Government,20
NA,"to desist, even at this stage, from followture",20
NA,ing such a procedure. What is the it,20
NA,reason for the Government's proposal?,20
NA,After persistent questioning by the OppoParliament.,20
NA,"sition, the Postmaster-General ( Mr.",20
NA,"Anthony) gave the astonishing explanatax,",20
NA,tion that the Government believes that,20
NA,it will be easier to remove an increase,20
NA,that is imposed at a flat rate on all,20
NA,able incomes than it would bs to remove,20
NA,an increase that is imposed proporin,20
NA,tionately according to income ranges.,20
NA,That is an ingenuous and unrealistic,20
NA,approach to this problem. Evidence is,20
NA,not wanting that the Government,20
NA,poses to adopt this method because it will,20
NA,make it easier later to increase the income,20
NA,tax still further. I t is likely that under,20
NA,the next budget that the Government,20
NA,introduces the rates of tax will be further,20
NA,"increased not by another 10 per cent,",20
NA,"by 15 per cent, or 20 per cent, but",20
NA,100 per cent.,20
NA,The Opposition cannot accept the,20
NA,reason that the Government has given,20
NA,for this imposition of a flat rate increase,20
NA,"of 10 per cent. Last week, the honorable",20
NA,member for Port Adelaide ( Mr.,20
NA,Thompson) pointed out that whilst the,20
NA,as imposition of a flat rate increase of 10,20
NA,"per cent, on the tax payable by taxpayers",20
NA,i n the lower ranges of income will not,20
NA,;,20
NA,"amount to very much, the basic wage is",20
NA,"increasing to such a degree, as the result",20
NA,"the normal processes of cost rises, that",20
NA,such taxpayers are being lifted progres-,20
NA,tax sively into liigher tax ranges. Whereas,20
NA,a few years ago the basic wags was,20
NA,"£6 a week, it is now over",20
NA,£10 a week; and it is probable that,20
NA,within the next six months it will be in-,20
NA,to approximately £12 a week. As,20
NA,has ths result of the quarterly adjustments,20
NA,fhe basic wage persons who are earn-,20
NA,rate ing incomes that are considered to be,20
NA,merely sufficient to provide a minimum,20
NA,standard of frugal comfort for a man,20
NA,the and his family are being taxed at,20
NA,increasingly greater rates. I n addition,20
NA,"to that, the Government now sees fit to",20
NA,impose this inequitable and unjust 10,20
NA,per cent. levy. I t is an imposition which,20
NA,cannot be justified. The ultra-simple state-,20
NA,ment has been made that it is being im-,20
NA,posed because it will be easy to remove.,20
NA,Government commitments and expendi-,20
NA,"are increasing from day to day, and",20
NA,is certain that the next budget will be,20
NA,larger than that at present before the,20
NA,I suggest that instead of this,20
NA,"tax ""being removed, further impositions of",20
NA,"possibly up to 100 per cent., will be",20
NA,made by this new and unjust method.,20
NA,The Government has again indicated,20
NA,taxthat it considers that the only persons,20
NA,the community who are responsible for,20
NA,"rising prices are, first, wage-earners,",20
NA,whom it endeavours to attack on,20
NA,"every possible occasion, and, secondly,",20
NA,prothe primary producers. By means of,20
NA,"this motion, the Government proposes to",20
NA,"go back to a completed financial year,",20
NA,during which farmers budgeted for their,20
NA,"commitments and their normal outgoings,",20
NA,and to impose a heavy additional tax,20
NA,or upon them. I suggest that under this,20
NA,by measure an added impost may be placed,20
NA,"upon taxpayers generally, including",20
NA,primary producers. The immediate effect,20
NA,of the motion will be to bring in addi-,21
NA,"tional revenue estimated at £47,000,000.",21
NA,I have no doubt that the Government,21
NA,considers that that is a small amount of,21
NA,money in view of its belief that the,21
NA,farmers have far too much money at the,21
NA,present time. That will be retrospective,21
NA,"taxation, which is always bad taxation.",21
NA,I t will be retrospective not only to the,21
NA,"few months of the current nnanciai year,",21
NA,but also to tho previous financial year.,21
NA,The Government now asserts that the,21
NA,averaging system no longer applies and,21
NA,that primary producers will pay tax for,21
NA,"the year ended the 30th June, 1951, under",21
NA,the ordinary principles of taxation. The,21
NA,Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) has,21
NA,stated that there are some unsatisfactory,21
NA,as.pects of the averaging system of taxa-,21
NA,tion. I suggeat that it has taken the right,21
NA,honorable gentleman a long time to arrive,21
NA,at that conclusion. I contend that the,21
NA,averaging system is not a bad method and,21
NA,is capable of expansion in order to include,21
NA,other categories of taxpayers who receive,21
NA,in one year a large income which has been,21
NA,earned over a period of years. I do not,21
NA,agree that the averaging system is bad,21
NA,"and should be avoided. I consider, rather,",21
NA,that i t should be far more thoroughly,21
NA,vestigated before it is done away with in,21
NA,the summary manner proposed by the,21
NA,Government. I t seems clear that the,21
NA,members of the Government are resentful,21
NA,of the attitude that was adopted by,21
NA,farmers towards tbe infamous wool,21
NA,stabilization scheme. I t has found that it qualified.,21
NA,must repay to the wool-growers,21
NA,"£45,000,000, and has now conceived",21
NA,"means by which that £45,000,000",21
NA,may be recovered. The Government,21
NA,has taken from the wool stabilization,21
NA,fund money belonging to the tax-,21
NA,payers and has used it for its own pur-,21
NA,poses. I n addition to recovering the,21
NA,"£45,000,000 by means of this motion, a",21
NA,"fine of £2,000,000 will be imposed",21
NA,"on the farmers, because they had",21
NA,the temerity to vote against the Govern-,21
NA,ment's stabilization scheme. I do not,21
NA,wonder that members of the Australian,21
NA,"Country party are restive, because this",21
NA,proposal is a new attack upon the people,21
NA,"whom they claim, quite wrongly, to repre-",21
NA,sent. Members of the Australian Coun-,21
NA,"try party, i f they genuinely claim to",21
NA,"be the representatives of the farmers,",21
NA,tliould stand for them.,21
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The,21
NA,honorable member's time has expired.,21
Mr LESLIE ,Moore) [4.50] -Th e,21
NA,speech by the honorable member for,21
NA,Perth ( Mr Tom Burke) is typical of all,21
NA,the attempts that have been made to,21
NA,deceive the people about this budget. I,21
NA,do not know whether the honorable,21
NA,gentleman is completely ignorant of the,21
NA,meaning of the motion that has been,21
NA,submitted by the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur,21
NA,"Fadden) or whether he has, with malice",21
NA,"aforethought, distorted it.",21
NA,Mr ERIC J. HARRISON -H e is reading,21
NA,"the motion now, for the first time.",21
Mr LESLIE,"H e probably is,",21
NA,because his speech revealed that he did,21
NA,not seem to understand it.,21
Mr BEAZLEY ,"I n that case, the",21
NA,Chairman does not know the contents of,21
NA,the motion.,21
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! I f the,21
NA,honorable member for Fremantle ( Mr.,21
NA,"Beazley) has reflected on the Chair, he",21
NA,must withdraw his remark.,21
Mr BEAZLEY , I withdraw the reflec-,21
NA,"tion on the Chair, but I point out that,",21
NA,"when I interjected, I thought that the-",21
NA,"in- honorable, member for Moore ( Mr.",21
NA,Leslie) had reflected on the Chair.,21
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The,21
NA,honorable member for Fremantle will,21
NA,withdraw his remark-unqualified .,21
Mr BEAZLEY , I withdraw it-un -,21
Mr TOM BURKE , I rise to order. I,21
NA,"point out, Mr Chairman, that the honor-",21
NA,able member for Fremantle said that the,21
NA,honorable member for Moore had reflected,21
NA,on the Chair when hs suggested that I,21
NA,was permitted to speak about matters,21
NA,which were not-relevant to this motion.,21
NA,"Mr BE'AZLEY -O f course, the state-",21
NA,ment by the honorable member for Moore,21
NA,was a reflection on the Chair.,21
NA,The 'CHAIRMAN -Ther e is no point,21
NA,of order.,21
Mr LESLIE ,Th e honorable member,21
NA,for Perth referred to the proposal to in-,21
NA,"crease by 10 per cent, the tax that will be",21
NA,levied on incomes during the current,21
NA,"financial year. He said, in no uncertain",21
NA,"terms, that ths. Government intended to",21
NA,apply that increase of tax retrospectively,21
NA,to the incomes of primary producers.,21
Mr BOWDEN ,Shame !,22
Mr TOM BURKE ,Th e honorahle,22
NA,member for Moore does not know what,22
NA,he is talking about.,22
Mr LESLIE ,Th e honorable mem-,22
NA,ber certainly conveyed that impression,22
NA,not only to me but also to a considerable,22
NA,number of honorable gentlemen on this,22
NA,"side of the chamber, who will confirm my",22
NA,"statement. I attempted, by signs, to",22
NA,correct the honorable member for Perth,22
NA,when he was making that erroneous state-,22
NA,"ment, but he ignored me. I desire to",22
NA,make it perfectly clear that the proposed,22
NA,increase of income tax will not be applied,22
NA,retrospectively to the incomes of primary,22
NA,"producers. I n fact, none of ths current",22
NA,taxation proposals will operate retro-,22
NA,spectively. The increased tax will apply,22
NA,"to the incomes of the primary producer,",22
NA,"the wage earner, the salary earner, the",22
NA,business man and the professional man,22
NA,during the current financial year. No,22
NA,section of the community has been,22
NA,singled out for special treatment.,22
NA,"Frankly, I prsfer the imposition of a",22
NA,"special tax, when the Government re-",22
NA,"quires increased revenue, because that",22
NA,levy can be abolished more easily at the,22
NA,appropriate time than a general,22
NA,increase of rates of income tax can,22
NA,be reduced. The Government will,22
NA,be able to abolish the special im-,22
NA,"position of 10 per cent, more quickly i f",22
NA,various sections i n . this country can be,22
NA,persuaded to co-operate in the national,22
NA,"interest. Labour governments in the past,",22
NA,"when they required additional revenue,",22
NA,preferred to increase the general rates of,22
NA,"income tax, and private members subse-",22
NA,quently had the greatest difficulty in per-,22
NA,suading those governments to reduce them.,22
NA,The honorable member for Perth also,22
NA,discussed the Government's wool stabiliza-,22
NA,"tion scheme, although that subject is not",22
NA,specifically referred to in this motion. I,22
NA,"point out to the honorable gentleman, for",22
NA,"his information, that the Government did",22
NA,not have a wool stabilization scheme. I,22
NA,"shall deal briefly with the position,",22
NA,it requires clarification. The Govern-,22
NA,"ment., at the request of the wool-growers,",22
NA,placed mpfins at their disposal to enable,22
NA,"them, i f they so desired, to have a stabi-",22
NA,lization scheme. That action was in con-,22
NA,formity with the policy of the Australian,22
NA,"Country party, which is to provide legis-",22
NA,lation to enable the wool-growers and,22
NA,other primary producers themselves to,22
NA,make the necessary arrangements for tho,22
NA,"operation of marketing schemes, i f they",22
NA,so desire. A Labour government would,22
NA,have taken the management of their,22
NA,affairs out of their hands and,22
NA,attempted to control their industry in,22
NA,accordance with socialist principles. That,22
NA,is the vital difference between the policy,22
NA,of this Government and that of the,22
NA,Labour party. Wool stabilization was not,22
NA,a government scheme. This Government,22
NA,was prepared to implement a decision of,22
NA,the wool-growers i f they were in favour,22
NA,"of stabilization, but a majority of them",22
NA,decided that they did not want it. Honor-,22
NA,able gentlemen on this side of the chamber,22
NA,"are not worried about that decision, be-",22
NA,cause it does not interfere in any way with,22
NA,the Government's proposals. The levy of,22
NA,"7£ per cent, was made at the request of",22
NA,"the wool-growers, and the Government'",22
NA,promised that the proceeds of it would be,22
NA,refunded to them as soon as the necessary,22
NA,arrangements could be made in that direc-,22
NA,tion. Those facts should be made known,22
NA,to the people.,22
Mr MCLEOD ,Wha t is the honorable,22
NA,gentleman complaining about?,22
Mr LESLIE , I am complaining be-,22
NA,cause the honorable member for Perth,22
NA,deliberately misrepresented the position.,22
NA,The honorable gentleman also referred,22
NA,to the proposed alteration of the averag-,22
NA,ing system. He is well aware of condi-,22
NA,"tions and happenings in my electorate,",22
NA,and he probably knows that I told pri-,22
NA,mary producers in Moore months ago,22
NA,"that the averaging system, and the",22
NA,"payment of provisional tax, would",22
NA,"act adversely to their interests, and",22
NA,that the time was opportune for,22
NA,them to consider an alteration of those,22
NA,systems. The producers know to-day,22
NA,"exactly where they stand, and they are",22
NA,dager that the averaging system be altered,22
NA,in order to remove from them the obliga-,22
NA,because tion to repay to the Government the,22
NA,whole of the moneys representing the,22
NA,amount by whicli they have so far bene-,22
NA,fited under the averaging system. I also,22
NA,point out that the averaging system is not,22
NA,being abolished. I t might be questionable,22
NA,whether we should be justified in abolish-,22
NA,ing that system. I t is being altered so,22
NA,that it will deal fairly with the producer,23
NA,and with other sections of taxpayers.,23
NA,Thank goodness that the Australian,23
NA,Country party is not so sectional in it3,23
NA,outlook that it disregards the interests of,23
NA,every section other than the primary pro-,23
NA,ducers. We aim to give a fair deal to,23
NA,every individual and every section of the,23
NA,"community, and to ensure that one section",23
NA,shall not be exploited at the expense of,23
NA,another section. I hope that I have clari-,23
NA,fied those matters sufficiently so that the,23
NA,people will not be deceived by the speech,23
NA,of the honorable member for Perth.,23
Mr KEON ,Yarra) [5.3] -I n con-,23
NA,sidering the Government's taxation pro-,23
NA,"posals, we should carefully examine the",23
NA,use on this occasion of the taxation,23
NA,"weapon, which will not be employed",23
NA,simply to raise the revenue that is re-,23
NA,quired for the purposes of administration.,23
NA,"Probably for the first time in our history,",23
NA,taxation is to be used purely as an eco-,23
NA,nomic weapon to enable the Governmenf,23
NA,to give effect to its financial policy. The,23
NA,proposed rates of income tax and social,23
NA,services contribution bear no relation to,23
NA,the revenue requirements of the Govern-,23
NA,"ment, and to its much-vaunted policy of",23
NA,encouraging production by reducing taxes.,23
NA,I shall address my remarks to that sub-,23
NA,ject. The Government claims that an,23
NA,increase of production is the only answer,23
NA,to the problem of inflation. That state-,23
NA,ment bas been accepted by every honor-,23
NA,"able member, and, indeed, by the people as",23
NA,"a whole, because, obviously, until the",23
NA,supply of goods is suflicient to meet the,23
NA,"demand, there can be no final answer to",23
NA,inflation.,23
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! I ask the,23
NA,honorable niember not to develop that,23
NA,theme. The motion under consideration,23
NA,deals with the proposed rates of income,23
NA,tax and social services contribution.,23
Mr KEON ,Th e point which I am,23
NA,endeavouring to make in relation to the,23
NA,proposed rates of income tax and social,23
NA,services contribution is that the Govern-,23
NA,ment has decided to use taxation as a,23
NA,weapon to enable it to give effect to its,23
NA,financial policy. I contend that the use to,23
NA,which such a weapon is put should be,23
NA,much more flexible than is proposed in,23
NA,the budget.,23
Mr EGGINS,Wh y does the honorable,23
NA,member call it a weapon?,23
Mr KEON , I shall call it an instru-,23
NA,"ment, i f the honorable member for Lyne",23
NA,( Mr Eggins) prefers that term. The,23
NA,"Government, which has pledged itself to",23
NA,"increase production, is using taxation as",23
NA,"a weapon, or an instrument, of financial",23
NA,policy. The particular form of production,23
NA,"in which I am interested at the moment,",23
NA,and in which we all must become increas-,23
NA,"ingly interested, is primary production.",23
NA,"I t is becoming a simple, stark fact that",23
NA,unless somebody does something to in-,23
NA,"crease primary production, the Australian",23
NA,"people will not continue to eat, and the",23
NA,"Australian standard of living, of which",23
NA,"we are so proud, will be no more. I",23
NA,should have thought that the Government,23
NA,would pay particular attention to,23
NA,the alarming drop in primary produc-,23
NA,tion. When we look at the graph pre-,23
NA,pared by the Commonwealth Grants Com-,23
NA,"mission we see that, with the exception",23
NA,"of wheat, the production of foodstuffs has",23
NA,not kept pace with the increased popula-,23
NA,tion. I f this trend continues we sliall,23
NA,not be able to pay for the machinery we,23
NA,need to bring about increased production.,23
NA,We shall not be able to pay for imports,23
NA,"from overseas, because it is an economic",23
NA,fact that we pay for our imports with,23
NA,our surplus primary products. Respon-,23
NA,sible economists now say that Australia,23
NA,is within an ace of having to import,23
NA,wheat. I f that should happen what,23
NA,would we have to pay for it? We are,23
NA,"now importing butter, and before long",23
NA,we may have to import potatoes and,23
NA,onions.,23
The CHAIRMAN , I do not mind the,23
NA,honorable member discussing the effect,23
NA,"of taxation on production, but I cannot",23
NA,allow a general debate on production,23
NA,when a. tax rate bill is being considered.,23
Mr KEON , I hoped to produce some,23
NA,effect on members of the Australian,23
NA,Country party who support the Govern-,23
NA,ment. I want to get the Government,23
NA,to use taxation as a method for increasing,23
NA,production where it is required.,23
The CHAIRMAN ,I t is not a ques-,23
NA,tion of whether the instrument of taxa-,23
NA,tion is being used well or otherwise. We,23
NA,are here now to consider the rate of the,23
NA,tax set forth in the motion.,23
Mr KEON , I am criticizing the bil],23
NA,because I believe that it should have,23
NA,provided-fbr differential rates. Surely,24
NA,it is germane to tbe discussion to suggest,24
NA,"tliat when, for instance, butter is scarce",24
NA,"the Government should, by use of a",24
NA,"differential rate of tax, encourage people",24
NA,to produce more butter.,24
NA,Mr ERIO J. HARRISON -I s the honor-,24
NA,able member advocating sectional taxa-,24
NA,tion ?,24
Mr KEON ,Certainly .,24
NA,Mr ERIC J. HARRISON -Tha t is a new,24
NA,"Labour policy, at any rate.",24
Mr KEON ,Th e Government is,24
NA,using taxation as an instrument of,24
NA,"economic policy. Obviously, i f Australia",24
NA,"is faced with a food famine, as seems",24
NA,"likely witlun the next decade, the Go-",24
NA,vernment ought to use taxation to encour-,24
NA,age the production of more food. I t,24
NA,should endeavour to stimulate the pro-,24
NA,"duction of butter, potatoes, onions, cheese,",24
NA,&c. Instead of slugging every one in-,24
NA,"discriminately, the Government should",24
NA,have considered the place of each group,24
NA,"in the economic fabric of the country,",24
NA,and have adjusted its tax rates accord-,24
NA,"ingly. I n particular, it should have con-",24
NA,sidered the food needs of Australia,24
NA,over the next ten years. I sug-,24
NA,gest that members of the Australian,24
NA,"Country party, who misrepresent the",24
NA,"primary producers, might well use their",24
NA,peculiar talents to induce the Govern-,24
NA,ment to accept the .policy that I have,24
NA,"outlined. Obviously, unless the Govern-",24
NA,"ment uses every means at its disposal, and",24
NA,differentiates betAveen those AA'ho are pro-,24
NA,ducingfancy goods in the cities and the,24
NA,primary producers who are engaged in,24
NA,the production of food so urgently needed,24
NA,"by the community, the present scarcity",24
NA,"of food will become more acute, and we",24
NA,shall not. be able to pay for the imports,24
NA,needed by our increasing popu-,24
NA,lation. According to a report pub-,24
NA,lished recently in a Sydney neAvs-,24
NA,"paper, the area under wheat has",24
NA,"declined from 7,000,000 acres to",24
NA,"4,000,000.",24
The CHAIRMAN ,Ho w is the honor-,24
NA,able meniber going to link up his remarks,24
NA,with the bill ?,24
Mr KEON , I suggest that - the 10,24
NA,"per cent, increase of income tax should not",24
NA,have been imposed upon workers in,24
NA,primary industries. Why should a man,24
NA,who works hard digging potatoes or bag-,24
NA,ging onions be discouraged from greater,24
NA,effort by the imposition of heavier taxa-,24
NA,tion ? When I . suggest reducing taxation,24
NA,as a means of increasing production I,24
NA,am using the words of honorable members-,24
NA,"opposite who,, during theelection cam-",24
NA,"paign of 1949, declared from every plat-",24
NA,form that the way to get increased produc-,24
NA,tion was to reduce' taxation. Now that-,24
NA,"their party is in power, however, taxation",24
NA,concessions' are being granted only to,24
NA,those on. larger incomes. Seasonal,24
NA,"workers in. the. primaryindustries earn,",24
NA,a fair income for a few months of the,24
NA,"year only, and Ave should not discourage",24
NA,them by taxing them heavily. I f the,24
NA,primary industries are to get the labour,24
NA,bhey need the Avorkers must be. offered a,24
NA,"proper incentive, unless there is to be",24
NA,direction of labour. The Government has,24
NA,"exhibited grave lack of imagination, and",24
NA,seems incapable of understanding the real,24
NA,needs of the nation. I t continues to use,24
NA,"taxation as a bludgeon, making no dif-",24
NA,ference between those who should be,24
NA,cared for and those who should be slugged,24
NA,"-no t an extra 10 per cent., but a great,",24
NA,"deal more. Before this debate is over, T",24
NA,hope to hear from some members of,24
NA,the Australian Country party -,24
The CHAIRMAN , Order! The,24
NA,honorable member's time has expired.,24
Mr TURNBULL ,Mallee) [5.13] -Let 1,24
NA,us see just bow much the increased taxa-,24
NA,tion will affect farm workers. A man,24
NA,with a taxable income of £600 a year,24
NA,paid under the old rate £24 18s. Under,24
NA,"the new rate he will pay £27 8s., an in-",24
NA,crease of £2 10s. Is it suggested that such,24
NA,an increase will take away the incen-,24
NA,tive to earn? Let us remember that the 1,24
NA,"increase represents only 10' per cent, on-",24
NA,the assessed tax. Members of the Labour,24
NA,party have been trying to confuse the,24
NA,minds of the people. I t would be amus-,24
NA,ing i f it were not serious to hear the',24
NA,honorable member for Perth ( Mr Toiw,24
NA,Burke) setting himself up as the champion,24
NA,"of the primary producers, and to hear",24
NA,"his colleague, the honorable member for",24
NA,Yarra ( Mr Keon). speaking as i f hs,24
NA,were really concerned for the interests of',24
NA,the primary producers when we all remem-,24
NA,ber him describing the wool-groAvers as,24
NA,"thfe."" Mood-sucking wool-growers "". .",24
Mr CREAN ,"Who "" said that?",24
NA,1 1,24
Mr TURNBULL ,The honorable,25
NA,member for Yarra. If anybody wants,25
NA,"proof, the remark is reported in Hansard.",25
Mr KEON ," I rise to order, Mr.",25
NA,Chairman. The honorable inember for,25
NA,Mallee has attributed to me a remark,25
NA,that I did not make.,25
Mr TURNBULL ,It is in Hansard.,25
Mr KEON ,Th e people whom I,25
NA,described as blood-suckers were the,25
NA,members of the Australian Country,25
NA,party. I said that they were sucking the,25
NA,blood of the rural community.,25
Mr TURNBULL ,I t is in Hansard. I,25
NA,will not withdraw it.,25
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! I f the,25
NA,honorable member for Yarra is calling,25
NA,"members of this committee blood-suckers,",25
NA,I ask him to witlidraw and apologize to,25
NA,the committee.,25
Mr HAYLEN ,Bu t that was in another,25
NA,"debate. You are out of order, Mr.",25
NA,Chairman.,25
The CHAIRMAN ,Order !,25
NA,honorable member for Yarra will obey,25
NA,the Ohair. He must withdraw and,25
NA,apologize.,25
Mr KEON ,Th e remark was made,25
NA,"over six months ago, Mr Chainnan.",25
The CHAIRMAN ,Th e honorable,25
NA,member has just made a statement by,25
NA,implication. I f the honorable member,25
NA,intended that remark to apply to the,25
NA,"Australian Country - party, he will with-",25
NA,draw and apologize to the committee.,25
Mr KEON , I shall' withdraw the,25
NA,"remark retrospectively, i f i t is offensive",25
NA,"tp you, Mr Chairman.",25
NA,;,25
The CHAIRMAN ,An d apologize!,25
Mr KEON , I will withdraw and,25
NA,"apologize, but nobody objected when the",25
NA,remark was made oh the previous,25
NA,occasion.,25
The CHAIRMAN , I point out that,25
NA,honorable members are not permitted to,25
NA,make such statements on points of order.,25
NA,The honorable member for Mallee will,25
NA,continue.,25
Mr TURNBULL ,I'was referring to,25
NA,"the fact that, about six months ago, the",25
NA,honorable member for Yarra described,25
NA,"the wool-growers as ""the blood-sucking",25
NA,"wool-growers "". It is in Hansard.",25
Mr KEON , I rise to order. The,25
NA,honorable memberfor Mallee has,25
NA,attributed to me a remark that I did not,25
NA,"make, and I suggest that he sliould be",25
NA,made to withdraw and apologize.,25
The CHAIRMAN ,I f the honorable,25
NA,"member has been misrepresented, he can",25
NA,obtain his remedy by making a personal,25
NA,explanation after the honorable member,25
NA,who is now addressing the committee has,25
NA,concluded his remarks.,25
Mr TURNBULL , I am perfectly,25
NA,willing to show to the honorable member,25
NA,and anybody else who may be interested,25
NA,the report of his remarks in Hansard.,25
NA,That report cannot be denied.,25
Mr KEON , Will the honorable,25
NA,member apologize if the alleged remark,25
NA,is not in Hansardl,25
Mr TURNBULL ,Certainly . I f it is,25
NA,"not there, I shall publicly apologize for",25
NA,the remarks that I am making now.,25
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The,25
NA,honorable member must address the,25
NA,The Chair.,25
Mr TURNBULL,Apparentl y the,25
NA,honorable member for Yarra varies the,25
NA,tone of his speeches in order to tickle the,25
NA,ear of the public and tries by that means,25
NA,to gain more votes or some favorable,25
NA,comment for the Labour party. I f he,25
NA,thinks that advantage may be gained by,25
NA,"supporting the wool-growers, he makes a",25
NA,speech such as we have just heard from,25
NA,him. The same course appears to have,25
NA,been followed by the honorable member,25
NA,"for Perth, because no speech could pos-",25
NA,sibly cause more confusion of thought,25
NA,than that of the honorable member.,25
NA,"There are approximately 300,000 pri-",25
NA,"mary producers in Australia, and over",25
NA,"250,000 of them will continue to pay",25
NA,taxes under the averaging system. Only,25
NA,those who have received exceptionally,25
NA,large wool cheques will be affected by the-,25
NA,proposed legislation. Not one member,25
NA,of the Labour party in this chamber has,25
NA,ever been known to express any sympathy,25
NA,for the wool-growers who have been,25
NA,receiving large incomes in recent years.,25
NA,As I look at the various members of the,25
NA,"Opposition, I recall the statements that",25
NA,they have made and I know that they,25
NA,have no sympathy for the wool-growers.,25
NA,I f I were to ask all members on the,25
NA,other side of the chamber who represent,25
NA,primary producing constituencies to,26
NA,"stand in tlieir places, only about two of",26
NA,tbem would rise to their feet.,26
The CHAIRMAN ,Order !,26
NA,has this to do with the motion?,26
Mr TURNBULL , I am pointing out,26
NA,that the sympathies of honorable members,26
NA,opposite are not with the wool-growers,26
NA,"and otlier primary producers, and that the",26
NA,sympathies of the primary producers are,26
NA,not with the Labour party. The farmers,26
NA,know exactly what to expect from the,26
NA,Labour party.,26
The CHAIRMAN,Th e honorable,26
NA,member must connect his remarks with,26
NA,the motion.,26
Mr TURNBULL ,"Th e 10 per cent,",26
NA,tax increase will not be retrospective.,26
NA,I t will apply only to income of the year,26
NA,1951-52. The relative incidence of in-,26
NA,come tax will be on the same scale as,26
NA,previously. The proposal will not put,26
NA,any more weight on the shoulders of a,26
NA,man with a small income than it will put,26
NA,on the shoulders of a man with a large,26
NA,"income. As I have said, a man earning",26
NA,£600 a year will have to pay only £2 10s.,26
NA,more in 1951-52 than he paid last year.,26
NA,This issue can be debated more fully at a,26
NA,later stage when the authorizing bill is,26
NA,"under consideration. Then, i f honorable",26
NA,members opposite have anything more to,26
NA,"say on the subject, we shall be very happy",26
NA,to answer their objections.,26
Mr CREAN ,Melbourne Ports) [5.20].,26
NA,- I propose to discuss the averaging pro-,26
NA,visions that are dealt with in the motion.,26
NA,"For the sake of clarity, it should be",26
NA,emphasized at the outset that wool-,26
NA,growers are not the only primary pro-,26
NA,ducers to whom the averaging provisions,26
NA,"apply. Under the averaging system, a",26
NA,taxpayer pays tax at a rate determined,26
NA,by taking the average of his income for,26
NA,the tax year and the preceding four,26
NA,years. One effect of the motion will be,26
NA,to remove from the scope of the averaging,26
NA,provisions primary producers whose,26
NA,current income and average income over,26
NA,the preceding four years is in excess of,26
NA,"£4,000 a year. Individuals whose actual",26
NA,income for the current year will be less,26
NA,"than £4,000, but whose average income",26
NA,over the previous four years was over,26
NA,"£4,000, will be taxed at the rate applicable",26
NA,"to £4,000 as laid down in the Eirst",26
NA,"Schedule. Furthermore, taxpayers who",26
NA,have been paying tax under the averaging,26
NA,provisions will be given the option of,26
NA,paying nnder the ordinary system in,26
NA,What future.,26
NA,I n the process of removing from the,26
NA,scope of the averaging provisions primary,26
NA,producers whose current income and,26
NA,average income for the past five years are,26
NA,"both in excess of £4,000 a year, an",26
NA,anomaly in the averaging provisions will,26
NA,be eliminated. I shall explain how that,26
NA,anomaly arises. For some years prior,26
NA,"to the financial year 1950-51, taxpayers",26
NA,claimed concessions in respect of depen-,26
NA,"dants, insurance premiums, medical ex-",26
NA,penses and so forth by the concessional,26
NA,"rebate system. But, commencing from",26
NA,"1950-51, the concessional deduction system",26
NA,was re-instituted. The effect of changing,26
NA,back to the concessional deduction,26
NA,system was to alter the concept of taxable,26
NA,income. That fact has an important,26
NA,bearing upon individuals whose income is,26
NA,"les3 than £4,000, and I remind honorable",26
NA,members on the Government side of the,26
NA,chamber that there are still many primary,26
NA,producers in receipt of comparatively,26
NA,small incomes. These taxpayers are to be,26
NA,penalized because the Government did not,26
NA,alter the concept of taxable income under,26
NA,the averaging provisions when it re-intro-,26
NA,duced the concessional deduction system,26
NA,in place of the concessional rebate system.,26
NA,The situation can be best illustrated by,26
NA,reference to a hypothetical case. I take,26
NA,the case of a primary producer who has,26
NA,"had an actual income of £1,200 in each of",26
NA,the last five years. I ask honorable mem-,26
NA,bers to note the distinction between actual,26
NA,income and taxable income. For the,26
NA,"sake of the illustration, I assume that",26
NA,the taxpayer has a wife and children and,26
NA,that the tax concessions to which he is,26
NA,entitled represent £40Q a year. Over the,26
NA,"period of four years prior to 1950-51,",26
NA,his taxable income for the purposes of the,26
NA,"averaging system was £1,200 a year. But",26
NA,"in 1950-51, with the same actual income",26
NA,"of £1,200, his taxable income was only",26
NA,£800 because the concessions to which he,26
NA,was entitled were first deducted from the,26
NA,"total. However, nnder the averaging",26
NA,"system, the rate at which he will be i",26
NA,required to pay tax on his taxable income |,26
NA,will be determined on the basis of four J,26
NA,"years at £1,200 and one year at £800.$",26
NA,His total income over the five-year period §,26
NA,"will be regarded as £5,600, which gives an",27
NA,"average figure of £1,120. This year,",27
NA,"upon a taxable income of £S00, he will",27
NA,pay income tax at the rate applicable to,27
NA,"an income of £1,120.",27
NA,"Mr Davidsun interjecting,",27
NA,""" Mr CHEAT*?"" -Th e honorable mem-",27
NA,ber for Dawson ( Mr Davidson) has not,27
NA,listened to what I have been saying.,27
NA,All that he wants to do is to defend a,27
NA,mistake that has been made by this Go-,27
NA,vernment. The honorable member for,27
NA,M!oore ( Mr Leslie) said that the Go-,27
NA,vernment was considering the interests of,27
NA,the small people. I am pointing out,27
NA,"that the more dependants a taxpayer has,",27
NA,"the worse, relatively, is he penalized,",27
NA,because his taxable income for this year,27
NA,is less than was his taxable income for,27
NA,the previous year. Taxpayers should,27
NA,"have been permitted to elect, i f they so",27
NA,"desired, to withdraw from the averaging",27
NA,"system, not next year but this year, l t",27
NA,would have been easy to make provision,27
NA,for that to be done.,27
NA,I have worked out some examples. The,27
NA,taxpayer to whom I have referred would,27
NA,pay £90 in income tax this year i f the,27
NA,tax were imposed upon his taxable in-,27
NA,come of £S00 a year at the rate applicable,27
NA,"to that income, but, owing to the opera-",27
NA,"tion of the averaging system, he will pay",27
NA,"£120 income tax, because the tax will be",27
NA,imposed at tbe rate applicable to his,27
NA,"average taxable income of £1,120 a year.",27
NA,"Therefore, his tax liability will be in-",27
NA,"creased by 33 per cent, as a result of this",27
NA,anomaly. I f his actual income were,27
NA,"£3,200 a year for the last 4 years and",27
NA,"if it remained at that figure this year,",27
NA,bis average taxable income would be,27
NA,"£3,120 because he, being entitled to",27
NA,concessional deductions to the value,27
NA,"of £400, would have a taxable in-",27
NA,come this year of only £2j800. I f,27
NA,income tax were levied upon him at the,27
NA,"rate applicable to an income of £2.800, he",27
NA,"would pay £S26 6s. Sd., but, under the",27
NA,"averaging system, it would be levied at",27
NA,the rate applicable to an income of,27
NA,"£3,120 a year, and he would pay",27
NA,£SS5 3s. 5d -a n increase of his tax,27
NA,liability by £60. The lower the general,27
NA,"income during the previous years, the",27
NA,harsher is the effect of this provision.,27
NA,"I am suggesting that there is, as it were,",27
NA,a forgotten race. There is a great deal,27
NA,of difference between the concept of tax-,27
NA,able income under a concessional rebate,27
NA,system and the concept of taxable income,27
NA,under a system of concessional deduc-,27
NA,"tions. We have changed the system but, as",27
NA,"far as the averaging system is concerned,",27
NA,we have made no allowance for the fact,27
NA,that in the previous four yeai'3 we were,27
NA,using the old concept of taxable income,27
NA,ancl that in the current year we shall use,27
NA,the new concept. We have changed from,27
NA,the concessional rebate system to the,27
NA,"concessional deductions system, but we",27
NA,have overlooked the effect that the new,27
NA,system will have upon people who are,27
NA,taxed upon the averaging system.,27
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The,27
NA,honorable gentleman's time has expired.,27
Mr THOMPSON ,Port Adelaide),27
NA,[5.28] - I was interested in the attempts,27
NA,of the honorable meniber for Moore ( Mr.,27
NA,Leslie) and the honorable member for,27
NA,Mallee ( Mr Turnbull) to hide the fact,27
NA,that this year primary producers will,27
NA,"pay an additional £47,000,000 in income",27
NA,tax. The Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden),27
NA,made no bones about that at all. He said,27
NA,that he was going to abolish the averaging,27
NA,system in respect of primary producers,27
NA,"with annual incomes of over £4,000 and",27
NA,that the effect of the change would be to,27
NA,"increase revenue by £47,000,000. Tbe",27
NA,honorable member for Perth ( Mr Tom,27
NA,Burke) dealt with that matter at some,27
NA,"length, and I was amazed when the honor-",27
NA,able member for Moore suggested that,27
NA,he had misrepresented the position. J,27
NA,could understand what the honorable,27
NA,"member for Perth was saying, even i f the",27
NA,honorable member for Moore was unabie,27
NA,to do so. The Vice-President of the,27
NA,Executive Council ( Mr Eric J.,27
NA,Harrison) interjected when the honor-,27
NA,able member for Perth was speaking and,27
NA,asked whether we on this side of the,27
NA,chamber believed in sectional taxation.,27
NA,"Almost immediately afterwards, the",27
NA,honorable member for Mallee pointed out,27
NA,how many primary producers would not,27
NA,be taxed under the averaging system and,27
NA,how many would be. Apparently the,27
NA,honorable gentleman is quite prepared lo,27
NA,agree to the imposition of a sectional,27
NA,tax upon primary producers with incomes,27
NA,"of over £4,000 a year. I t is not the",27
NA,Opposition but bonorable gentlemen,28
NA,opposite wbo are doing the seetionalizing.,28
NA,"The Australian Country party, which",28
NA,supposed to represent the primary,28
NA,"ducers, finds it very difficult to explain",28
NA,why they should be called upon to pay,28
NA,"an additional £47,000,000 in inoome tax",28
NA,"this year. However, I do not want to",28
NA,dwell at length upon that point. As I,28
NA,"said recently, the members of the Ausreceived",28
NA,tralian Country party should be left,28
NA,argue it.,28
NA,I am concerned about the Government's,28
NA,attempt to make it appear that income,28
NA,tax is to be increased by only 10 per,28
NA,cent. That is not the position. Last living,28
NA,"year, the basic wage was approximately",28
NA,"£8 a week. This year, it is approximately",28
NA,"£10 a week. Therefore, this year a man",28
NA,who is in receipt of the basic wage will suggested.,28
NA,"pay, not 10 per cent, more income tax",28
NA,"than he paid last year, but tax upon",28
NA,"income of £10 a week, plus 10 per cent.",28
NA,The rate at which income tax is imposed,28
NA,upon an income of £10 a week is greater,28
NA,than that at which i t is imposed upon ment !,28
NA,an inoome of £S a week. I recall that,28
NA,"when the Labour party was in office,",28
NA,"members of the present Governmenl case,",28
NA,"parties, who were then in Opposition,",28
NA,"would say, "" Last year the tax paid per",28
NA,"head of population was £70, and this year",28
NA,"it is £90 "". They have not argued in",28
NA,that way during this debate. They,28
NA,"not pointed out that, under the rates of",28
NA,"tax specified in this motion, the Govern-",28
NA,ment will collect from individuals 'this,28
NA,"year 100 per cent, more income tax than",28
NA,it collected last year. When the Governposition,28
NA,ment talks about increasing income tax,28
NA,"by only 10 per cent., although it knows",28
NA,"that it will receive 100 per cent, more",28
NA,from the tax this year than it did last,28
NA,"year, i t is putting something over",28
NA,people.,28
NA,Let us examine the case of a man with children.,28
NA,a wife and two children whose income last,28
NA,"year was £400, or roughly the basic wage.",28
NA,Last year he paid £2 8s. in income,28
NA,If his income tax were increased by only,28
NA,"10 per cent., this year he would pay",28
NA,£2 13s. But his income this year will be,28
NA,"approximately £500, because the basic",28
NA,wage has been increased to approximately,28
NA,£10 a week. He will be no better off,28
NA,"as a result of the increase, because the",28
NA,"price of almost everything has increased,",28
NA,Mr Thompson.,28
NA,but instead of paying £2 8s. income tax,28
NA,he will pay £9 l i s . I f it can be,28
NA,is shown that that is an increase of,28
NA,"proonly 10 per cent., I shall go "" he"".",28
NA,I f the Taxation Branch and the Trea-,28
NA,surer had been fair they would have made,28
NA,the rate of tax appropriate to an income,28
NA,of £400 now applicable to an income of,28
NA,"£500, because the additional £100 a year",28
NA,by basic wage workers is intended,28
NA,to to cover increased living costs. Under,28
NA,.these proposals the unfortunate basic,28
NA,wage worker will be hit both ways. I n,28
NA,addition to having to pay tax on an income,28
NA,that has been increased to cover higher,28
NA,"costs, he will have to pay a special",28
NA,"levy equal to 10 per cent, of the tax",28
NA,applicable to that higher income. The,28
NA,rates should be scaled down as I have,28
NA,Mr EKIC J. HAHKISON -Doe s the,28
NA,an honorable member suggest that a poli;,28
NA,"tician who formerly received £1,000 and",28
NA,"now receives £1,500 should pay tax on",28
NA,"only £1,000? What a ridiculous argu-",28
NA,Mr THOMPSON:- I am arguing the,28
NA,not of a taxpayer in a high income,28
NA,"group, but of a man on the basic wage.",28
NA,Living costs affect every member of the,28
NA,community and not only one section of it.,28
Mr TURNBULL ,Wha t would happen,28
NA,have when living costs were reduced?,28
Mr THOMPSON ,Cost s would be,28
NA,reduced to all persons alike. The honor-,28
NA,able member for Mallee referred to the,28
NA,of a basic wage worker employed,28
NA,by a farmer who previously paid £2 8s.,28
NA,in tax and under the new proposal will,28
NA,pay £2 10s. The honorable member did,28
NA,not say that that tax applied to a tax-,28
NA,tho payer who had a wife and one child.,28
Mr TURNBULL , I said that it applied,28
NA,to a taxpayer with a wife and two,28
Mr THOMPSON , A basic wage,28
NA,tax. worker with no dependants would pay,28
NA,very much more than the amount stated,28
NA,by the honorable niember. This proposal,28
NA,is iniquitous because it ignores the 'fact,28
NA,that increases of the basic wage have been,28
NA,granted solely to offset higher living costs.,28
NA,The honorable member for Moore ( Mr.,28
NA,Leslie) has said that the Government has,28
NA,adopted the simple procedure of imposing,28
NA,"a special levy equal to 10 per cent, of",29
NA,assessed tax and that i f a new scale of,29
NA,rates were introduced the people would,29
NA,have great dimculty in understanding,29
NA,it. I need not remind the honorable,29
NA,member that what interests the ordinary,29
NA,man in the street is not the method by,29
NA,which his tax commitment is assessed but,29
NA,the amount he has to pay. Under this,29
NA,"proposal, instead of merely paying a",29
NA,"special levy equal to 10 per cent, of",29
NA,assessed tax he will pay an amount which,29
NA,"niay be 20 per cent, higher than that paid",29
NA,last year.,29
Mr LESLIE ,H e will have additional,29
NA,money with which to pay the increased,29
NA,tax.,29
Mr THOMPSON ,Th e only addi-,29
NA,tional money in the hands of the workers,29
NA,is money that has been awarded to them,29
NA,by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court,29
NA,to offset increased living costs.,29
The CHAIRMAN , Order! The,29
NA,honorable member's time has expired.,29
Mr HAMILTON ,Canning) [5.40] -,29
NA,Tho honorable member for Port Adelaide,29
NA,( Mr Thompson) referred to the collection,29
NA,"of £47,000,000 from primary producers",29
NA,in consequence of the modification of the,29
NA,averaging system. I n order to clarify,29
NA,the position I propose to read what the,29
NA,Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) had to,29
NA,say on the subject. The right honorable,29
NA,gentleman is reported in Hansard to have,29
NA,said-,29
NA,The total number of primary producers is,29
NA,"estimated to be 300,000. Of this total .number,",29
NA,"202,500 are within the range whose taxable",29
NA,"incomes do not exceed £4,000. The",29
NA,of the averaging system will thus apply only to,29
NA,"37,500 primary producers out of 300,000, and",29
NA,"df the 37,500 abor.t 9,500 would not",29
NA,to any appreciable extent.,29
NA,"Thus, only about 28,000 primary pro-",29
NA,ducers will be affected to any great degree,29
NA,by the modification of the averaging sys-,29
NA,tem. Listening to the honorable member,29
NA,one would have thought that the,29
NA,"wbole of the £47,000,000 would be",29
NA,collected as income tax for one year.,29
NA,He is well aware that that is not,29
NA,the case - - The Treasurer has explained,29
NA,"that of the £47,000,000 to be collected",29
NA,"from the primary producers £22,500,000",29
NA,will be i n respect of the - income year,29
NA,"1950-51, and £24,500,000 will be in respect",29
NA,of provisional tax for 1951-52. Opposi-,29
NA,tion members generally have endeavoured,29
NA,to delude the primaiy producers into,29
NA,believing that the whole amount will be,29
NA,collected in respect of the income year,29
NA,1950-51. Most of the farmers who will,29
NA,be affected by this proposal have not yet,29
NA,sold their wool. They will not receive,29
NA,"their assessments until February next, by",29
NA,which time they will have at their dis-,29
NA,posal the return from their clip to meet,29
NA,their tax commitments. Opposition mem-,29
NA,bers told a similar story last year about,29
NA,the Government's wool deduction scheme,29
NA,and forecast all sorts of dire results from,29
NA,that legislation; but when the wool-,29
NA,growers found out what was really in-,29
NA,volved they refused to listen further to,29
NA,Opposition scaremongers. The Treasurer,29
NA,has explained that of the total estimated,29
NA,"receipts of £47,000,000 in 1951-52, result-",29
NA,ing from the modification of the averaging,29
NA,"system, primary producers with incomes",29
NA,"of between £4,000 and £6,000 will pay",29
NA,"only £3,500,000, and that the balance of",29
NA,"£43,500,000 will come from those with",29
NA,"incomes in excess of £6,000. I f primary",29
NA,producers -examine this proposal fairly,29
NA,they will see that it will do them a great,29
NA,service. They realize that the prices of,29
NA,primary products will not remain at their,29
NA,present high level and that when prices,29
NA,fall they will have lower incomes with,29
NA,which to meet their tax commitments.,29
NA,At the commencement of this debate,29
NA,the honorable member for Perth ( Mr.,29
NA,Tom Burke) said that the special levy of,29
NA,"10 per cent, of assessed tax would apply",29
NA,to income earned in the income year ended,29
NA,"modification the 30th June, 1951.",29
Mr TOM BURKE ,Th e honorable mem-,29
NA,be affected ber can never tell the truth.,29
Mr HAMILTON ,Th e honorable,29
NA,member knows that the special levy,29
NA,applies to income of the taxable year,29
NA,"ending the 30th June, 1952, and that it",29
NA,has no retrospective application whatso-,29
NA,ever.,29
NA,I rose principally to deal with some of,29
NA,the remarks of the honorable member for,29
NA,"Yarra ( Mr Keon), who seemed to take",29
NA,great delight in telling the people that,29
NA,there is likely to be a very serious,29
NA,shortage of food in Australia. I f there is,29
NA,"a shortage of food, it will result from",29
NA,the activities of persons whom the honorknows,30
NA,' able member has supported during the,30
NA,last five or six years.,30
Mr KEON ,Rot !,30
Mr HAMILTON ,Th e honorable,30
NA,inember spoke about potatoes.,30
The CHAIRMAN ,Order !,30
NA,honorable member is getting rather,30
NA,of the motion.,30
Mr HAMILTON ,Th e incentive,30
NA,produce more food,30
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! I ask the,30
NA,honorable member to confine his remarks,30
NA,to the motion.,30
Mr HAMILTON ,I t has been said,30
NA,that we should give some incentive,30
NA,primary producers by reducing the,30
NA,of taxation. I f such a reduction were,30
NA,made it would not affect the production,30
NA,of at least some of the foodstuffs that were,30
NA,mentioned by the honorable member. At,30
NA,present primary producers in some States indirect taxes,30
NA,must obtain a permit to grow potatoes.,30
NA,What incentive would be given to,30
NA,pective potato-grower by a reduction of,30
NA,taxes i f he could not obtain a permit,30
NA,grow them? Legislation was introduced,30
NA,in the Queensland Parliament recently,30
NA,prescribing that primary producers must,30
NA,deliver foodstuffs where directed. What,30
NA,incentive would be given to Queensland,30
NA,producers by a reduction of taxation,30
NA,while legislation of that kind continues,30
NA,to operate?,30
NA,Opposition members have advocated,30
NA,the reduction of rates of income,30
NA,applicable to farm labourers. When,30
NA,Opposition members sat on this side of,30
NA,the chamber they were supported to the,30
NA,hilt by tbe Governments of New South,30
NA,Wales and Queensland in their attempt,30
NA,to prescribe a 56-hour week for farm,30
NA,labourers when a 40-hour week was,30
NA,standard working week for every other obtain enough.,30
NA,section of industry. Yet they come into,30
NA,this chamber and say that the Govern-,30
NA,"ment should, by reducing tax rates, give",30
NA,tiie dairy-farmers an incentive to pro-,30
NA,duce more. Honorable members oppo-,30
NA,site would do better to go into the,30
NA,workshops of this country and encourage,30
NA,the workers to produce more machines,30
NA,"for the use of tbe farmers, because lack",30
NA,of machinery is a brake on rural produc-,30
NA,tion at present. Every sane Australian,30
NA,that the increase of taxes that is,30
NA,to operate from the beginning of this,30
NA,financial year is designed for a specific,30
NA,"purpose, which is the financing of our",30
NA,intensified defence programme. Have,30
NA,some honorable gentlemen opposite not,30
NA,heard of the fact that a war of interna-,30
NA,The tional significance broke out in Korea,30
NA,"wide about eighteen months ago, as a",30
NA,consequence of which the whole inter-,30
NA,"national situation, and also the inter-",30
NA,"to nal conditions of this country, have",30
NA,changed? Honorable members opposite,30
NA,say that the Government has not reduced,30
NA,"taxes since it took office, although they",30
NA,know that throughout the whole of the,30
NA,last financial year they paid a reduced,30
NA,rate of tax on their parliamentary,30
NA,"to salaries, because the Government had",30
NA,rates reduced taxes on all incomes.,30
Mr BIRD ,Wha t about indirect taxes?,30
Mr HAMILTON ,Th e position about,30
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! That,30
NA,a prosmatter is not under discussion.,30
Mr HAMILTON , I was merely,30
NA,to answering the honorable member for,30
NA,Batman ( Mr Bird). I t is of no use,30
NA,for honorable members opposite to come,30
NA,here and talk about shortages of food-,30
NA,stuffs and offering incentives to farmers,30
NA,by way of reduced tax rates. As I have,30
NA,"said, the increase of taxes is designed for",30
NA,"a specific purpose, and it does the Oppo-",30
NA,sition little credit to try to cloud the issue,30
NA,by alleging that shortages of foodstuffs,30
NA,tax have been caused by lieavy taxes. We,30
NA,could get plenty of butter and all the,30
NA,foodstuffs we want without any alteration,30
NA,of the Government's tax proposals i f a,30
NA,more earnest production effort were made,30
NA,by the workers in the industries which,30
NA,produce machinery and other equipment,30

NA,in order to bring the Government's finan-,31
NA,cial proposals set out in the budget,31
NA,before the notice of this committee and of,31
NA,"Sheehan, T.",31
NA,the country generally. Over 100 speakers,31
NA,PA IRS. have participated in this debate. By,31
NA,"Bourke, W. M.",31
NA,means of the amendment before the,31
NA,"committee, the Opposition, in effect,",31
NA,has demanded that the budget be,31
NA,"withdrawn. In other words, it",31
NA,has challenged the budget as a whole,31
NA,and it must therefore be defended as a,31
NA,whole. The Government is quite happy,31
NA,to do that and it is my responsibility to,31
NA,discharge that function. After weeks,31
NA,of debate within this chamber and,31
NA,beyond it ths Government has every,31

NA,its economic and financial policy right out,31
NA,SECOND BEADING.,31
NA,into the open and has told the people,31
NA,about it. I t has laid all its cards on the,31
NA,table at every stage. Two months before,31
NA,the budget was presented the Prime Min-,31
NA,ister ( Mr Menzies) called a conference in,31
NA,Sydney to discuss the problem of infla-,32
NA,tion in all its aspects. He invited tbe,32
NA,"attendance of State Premiers, representa-",32
NA,"tives of industry, commerce and primary",32
NA,"production, employers' organizations, the",32
NA,"trade unions, women's organizations and",32
NA,the churches. He put before that confer-,32
NA,ence a detailed analysis of the economic,32
NA,problem as the Commonwealth saw it and,32
NA,asked the other people present to,32
NA,express their views. They did so and the,32
NA,conference provided a most valuable,32
NA,guide to public opinion on the subject.,32
NA,- I n my budget speech I stated again the,32
NA,view of the Government on the economic,32
NA,problem from the nnanciai standpoint. I,32
NA,set out in plain terms what the Govern-,32
NA,ment considers to be the basic causes of,32
NA,inflation in this country and the financial,32
NA,measures required to deal with them.,32
NA,The Prime Minister publicly stated that,32
NA,there would be a budget' surplus- a real,32
NA,and substantial surplus-an d the Go-,32
NA,vernment will stand up to that policy. I t,32
NA,could not be said that the Labour Govern-,32
NA,ment was always so frank about its finan-,32
NA,cial position and financial plans. Whilst,32
NA,"it had a surplus once or twice, it never",32
NA,admitted the fact. There used to be talk,32
NA,about reserves and provision for the,32
NA,"future. But never once did it say, as the",32
NA,"Government has said, "" We are budgeting",32
NA,"for a surplus. We shall tell you why,",32
NA,"and exactly how much we expect it to be "".",32
NA,The essential difference .between the,32
NA,policies of the Government and of the,32
NA,Opposition goes still deeper than this.,32
NA,It lies in their opposite approaches to,32
NA,the problem of controlling inflation. The,32
NA,Government is endeavouring to deal with,32
NA,the root causes of inflation. It rejects,32
NA,"palliatives and superficial remedies, such",32
NA,as prices control. The Opposition wants,32
NA,"to cover up inflation, blanket it with",32
NA,controls and then pretend that it no longer,32
NA,exists. The Leader of the Opposition,32
NA,(Dr Evatt) harked back in his speech to,32
NA,the legend that the Labour Government,32
NA,preserved a stable economy and a sound,32
NA,financial position. It did nothing of the,32
NA,sort. During the war and for a year or,32
NA,two after the war it kept the economy,32
NA,tightly trussed in a vast network of,32
NA,controls and called that stability. But,32
NA,vt was only an illusion. The forces of,32
NA,inflation were banking up underneath the,32
NA,controls and it was certain that once they,32
NA,Sir Arthur Fadden.,32
NA,were released they would be all the worse,32
NA,for being held back for so long. The,32
NA,Labour Government kept up. this illusion,32
NA,of stability for a time. Once it gave up,32
NA,"control of wages, however, the illusion",32
NA,began to fail. Prices and costs started,32
NA,to rise steeply and kept on rising. By,32
NA,the time of the election in 1949 the,32
NA,Labour Government had largely lost con-,32
NA,trol of the situation and had not an idea,32
NA,about what it should do.,32
NA,This may also be said. of .the myth of,32
NA,stable Labour finance. Because war and,32
NA,"post-war expenditure taperedoff quickly,",32
NA,because tax yields rose with rising incomes,32
NA,"and trade, and a big amount of income tax",32
NA,"arrears was overtaken, the Labour Go-",32
NA,vernment was able in two years to balance,32
NA,"its budget. That, however, was of no",32
NA,particular credit to it and the position,32
NA,soon changed for the worse. Its last,32
NA,"budget resulted in a deficit of £25,000,000",32
NA,and there can be no doubt that had,32
NA,it remained in office it would soon have,32
NA,been in serious difficulties. I t is time we,32
NA,heard the last of the masterly economic,32
NA,and financial policy of the Labour Go-,32
NA,vernment.,32
NA,For the present Government it can,32
NA,be said that though confronted with,32
NA,a far different world from that apparent,32
NA,"in December, 1949, which necessitated",32
NA,a steep rise of defence expenditure and,32
NA,"general costs, it balanced its budget",32
NA,and reduced taxation in its first year of,32
NA,office. I n its second year it has budgeted,32
NA,"for a substantial surplus. I n other words,",32
NA,"it has pulled together a situation which,",32
NA,"under Labour, was being permitted to go",32
NA,to pieces:,32
NA,"Opposition members interjecting,",32
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! Honor-,32
NA,able members have spoken on the budget,32
NA,during the last four weeks. I insist,32
NA,upon the Treasurer being heard.,32
Sir ARTHUR FADDEN ,I n the,32
NA,budget for the financial year 1951-52 the,32
NA,-Government has frankly set out tho,32
NA,"financial problem that confronts it,",32
NA,together with the measures i t proposes to,32
NA,"take, and has invited its critics, both",32
NA,"inside the Parliament and elsewhere, to",32
NA,propose an alternative i f they have one.,32
NA,I t is fair to say that no really practicable,32
NA,alternative has been forthcoming. All the,32
NA,so-called alternatives that have been,33
NA,"espoused would amount, in practice, to",33
NA,of two things: The Government should,33
NA,either reduce expenditure to a point,33
NA,which essential services and works could,33
NA,"not be carried on, or resort to central budget.",33
NA,bank credit to meet a large part of its,33
NA,expenditure.,33
NA,The Government gave expenditure the,33
NA,"foremost attention, and, as I have shown",33
NA,"in niy budget speech, achieved very subwar",33
NA,stantial savings. The capital works Estipensions,33
NA,mates that were originally prepared,33
NA,the departments showed a very large,33
NA,expected increase of expenditure comexpenditure,33
NA,pared with the last nnanciai year. W? committed in advance.,33
NA,pruned them back and now the programme,33
NA,for this financial year contains only the,33
NA,most essential undertakings. The estisubsidies,33
NA,mated expenditure on them is practically,33
NA,the same as was actual works expenditure,33
NA,in 1950-51.,33
NA,"Despite powerful but irresponsible pres- £2S,000,000;",33
NA,"sures, the Government pegged the dairy",33
NA,"products subsidy at £16,800,000-whic",33
NA,is a fair thing by any standard. We,33
NA,"minated the woollen goods subsidy, which",33
NA,no longer would have served its original,33
NA,"purpose, and we combed a multitude",33
NA,individual items in the Estimates -to effect,33
NA,savings wherever possible. Yet after all,33
NA,"this had been done, it was clear that the",33
NA,Government would still have to meet a,33
NA,much larger total expenditure this year,33
NA,than last year. We shall have to find more and in what way?,33
NA,"for defence, more for the States, and more",33
NA,for the National Welfare Fund. Because,33
NA,loan money is likely to be in short supply,33
NA,"this year, we budgeted to meet from Con-",33
NA,solidated Eevenue expenditure on war,33
NA,"service homes, which last year was",33
NA,"financed from Loan Fund. All told, the",33
NA,estimate of total expected expenditure,33
NA,"about £120,000,000 greater than the",33
NA,actual expenditure in 1950-51.,33
NA,I t was also clear that the revenue,33
NA,sight from taxation at existing rates would,33
NA,not meet total expected expenditure; in,33
NA,"fact, i t was likely to be nearly £50,000,000",33
NA,short of that amount. I shall briefly run,33
NA,over the main figures in order to show,33
NA,how that position came about. I t was,33
NA,"estimated that the total revenue this year,",33
NA,"at existing rates, would be £881,000,000.",33
NA,"Of that amount, however, the revenuo",33
NA,"of £67,000,000 from the business underprogrammes",33
NA,"takings, including the Postal Department",33
NA,"one and the Commonwealth Eailways, would",33
NA,just about cover their working expenses.,33
NA,"at Therefore, only £814,000,000 would be",33
NA,available for the general purposes of the,33
NA,I f we considered only four of the major,33
NA,"expenditure items, namely, payments to",33
NA,"the States, £161,000,000, transfer to the",33
NA,"National Welfare Fund of £185,000,000,",33
NA,"debt charges of £58,000,000, and war",33
NA,"and repatriation, £49,000,000,",33
NA,by all of which can be regarded as irre-,33
NA,"ducible, it is obvious that an estimated",33
NA,"of £453,000,000 was virtually",33
NA,That left,33
NA,"£361,000,000 from which to meet defence,",33
NA,"£1S2,000,000; capital works £102,000,000;",33
NA,"£33,000,000; immigration,",33
NA,"ordinary services £12,000,000; depart-",33
NA,"mental £40,000,000; international relief",33
NA,"£10,000,000 and other expenditure",33
NA,making a total of,33
NA,"£407,000,000. Obviously, it would not",33
NA,h work out. Additional taxes would have,33
NA,terto be imposed if the Commonwealth wa's,33
NA,to finance its own responsibilities for the,33
NA,year without seeking newly created money,33
NA,of from the Commonwealth Bank. I f any,33
NA,one still argues that we could have reduced,33
NA,"estimated expenditure further, I ask them",33
NA,to go over that list of items I have just,33
NA,cited and say which items could or should,33
NA,"be still further reduced, by how much,",33
NA,Beyond the provision of funds to meet,33
NA,"the Commonwealth's own expenditure,",33
NA,"however, we had agreed to see that funds",33
NA,"up to £225,000,000 would be available for",33
NA,"the Loan Council programmes in 1951-52,",33
NA,comprising the State works programmes,33
NA,is and the Commonwealth and State housing,33
NA,-programme. I have explained that under-,33
NA,taking in my budget speech and tbe Prime,33
NA,Minister has discussed it at length,33
NA,in in this debate. I do not think that it,33
NA,"needs explaining further. I t has, how-",33
NA,"ever, been insistently criticized in some",33
NA,"quarters, and we have heard the argument",33
NA,that i f only the States works programmes,33
NA,had been cut back far enough there would,33
NA,not have been any necessity to increase,33
NA,taxation. Those who so criticize should,33
NA,ascertain the views of the State govern-,33
NA,ments in this connexion. Their works,33
NA,have been reduced by 25 per,33
NA,"cent, and the Commonwealth was vehe-",34
NA,mently assured by the State Premiers,34
NA,that any further reduction would,34
NA,result in default on contracts and similar,34
NA,"commitments, as well as the closing down",34
NA,of vital projects and the throwing out of,34
NA,"work of large numbers of men,- all of",34
NA,which would cause a chaotic condition.,34
NA,Tbe Commonwealth was convinced that,34
NA,many items in the original States,34
NA,programmes could be deferred with-,34
NA,out much harm being done thereby.,34
NA,"At the same time, we knew that the",34
NA,main body of works in the pro-,34
NA,"grammes were important and useful, and",34
NA,ought to proceed i f labour and materials,34
NA,were available. I t is noticeable that the,34
NA,critics who blame the Commonwealth for,34
NA,underwriting State works programmes,34
NA,at a reduced level perennially blame the,34
NA,State governments for deficiencies of,34
NA,"power supplies, port facilities, road and",34
NA,rail transport and hospital accommoda-,34
NA,tion. They should make up their,34
NA,minds about what they want. They,34
NA,have claimed that the State govern-,34
NA,ments have curtailed development. But,34
NA,these works are developmental. I f they,34
NA,"want electricity undertakings, water sup-",34
NA,"ply and sewerage, housing, and road con-",34
NA,struction curtailed they should say so.,34
NA,Then we and the public would know,34
NA,where they really stand.,34
NA,The Government remains convinced,34
NA,that by making possible the completion,34
NA,"of such essential undertakings, it did",34
NA,right thing in the circumstances. At,34
NA,"same time, it realizes fully the nnanciai",34
NA,"implications. We knew that the loan marBill,",34
NA,ket was likely to yield a good deal,34
NA,"than £225,000,000, and we were not preworth",34
NA,pared to use treasury-bill finance for,34
NA,"works programmes. Therefore, we had to",34
NA,face the fact that our undertaking to thc,34
NA,States could be met only by raising more,34
NA,revenue.,34
NA,The imposition of additional taxation,34
NA,"sufficient to produce £160,000,000 in this",34
NA,nnanciai year may well be regarded as,34
NA,drastic step. But is it out of proportion,34
NA,the needs and conditions of our times?,34
NA,Let us keep before our minds the fact that,34
NA,"we, along with the other countries of",34
NA,"western world, are engaged in preparafair",34
NA,tions against to possibility of war,34
NA,a world scale. Let us have regard to,34
NA,Sir Arthur Fadden.,34
NA,what other western countries are doing,34
NA,in the way of defence preparations. Only,34
NA,a few days ago it was announced that the,34
NA,Congress of the United States of America,34
NA,"had voted a further sum, equivalent to",34
NA,"nearly £6,000,000,000 in our money, for",34
NA,national security. That brought the total,34
NA,amount appropriated for defence in this,34
NA,"year alone to nearly £37,000,000,000.",34
NA,"The United Kingdom, a country already",34
NA,"far more heavily taxed than is Australia,",34
NA,imposed lieavy additional taxation this,34
NA,year. Canada also has increased taxation,34
NA,"substantially. Therefore, in what we are-",34
NA,doing in this budget we are in very good,34
NA,company.,34
NA,When the Government came to con-,34
NA,"sider what taxes should be increased, i t",34
NA,naturally gave much thought to appor-,34
NA,tionment of the burden. There were ob-,34
NA,vious advantages in spreading the burden,34
NA,as widely as possible so that it would fall,34
NA,with the minimum weight on any one,34
NA,"class of taxpayers. I t was also obvious,",34
NA,"however, that some classes of the com-",34
NA,munity could stand more taxation than,34
NA,"others, and that some forms of taxes",34
NA,would have less effect on incentives to,34
NA,work and save than would others.,34
NA,One of the first things to do was to,34
NA,examine the taxation laws as they stood,34
NA,and ascertain whether tliey were giving,34
NA,an undue advantage to any class of tax-,34
NA,payers when compared with others. There,34
NA,was one outstanding example of this-th e,34
NA,the operation of the averaging system. As,34
NA,the I pointed out in my second-readiug,34
NA,speech on the Income Tax Assessment,34
NA,this system had already given to the,34
NA,less taxpayers subject to it an advantage,34
NA,many millions of pounds in recent,34
NA,"years, and had i t been continued un-",34
NA,modified they would have gained a further,34
NA,"£62.000,000 in the current financial year.",34
NA,"Plainly, a situation like that had to be",34
NA,rectified before we could do anything to,34
NA,increase taxation on otlier people who had,34
NA,not shared in this most lucrative conces-,34
NA,"a sion. On the other hand, something had to",34
NA,to be done to safeguard the position of pro-,34
NA,ducers against the difficulties that would,34
NA,arise in the event of a fall of incomes.,34
NA,the I t is somewhat ironical that those who,34
NA,"are now criticizing the changes made,",34
NA,"and moderate though they be, are",34
NA,on much the same peopie who last year were,34
NA,demanding to be treated on the same basis,35
NA,"as other taxpayers. They, also, should",35
NA,make up their minds.,35
NA,The Government also saw much merit,35
NA,"in taxing spending rather than earnings,",35
NA,for there can be no doubt that the eifect,35
NA,on' incentive of such taxes on spending,35
NA,is less than that of taxes levied directly on,35
NA,incomes. There can be no doubt either,35
NA,"that, despite shortages of some commodi-",35
NA,"ties, the genera] level of spending on con-",35
NA,sumption good's has been extraordinarily,35
NA,high. Beer is perhaps the classic,35
NA,"example. Last year, the consumption of",35
NA,"beer in Australia was 173,000,000 gallons,",35
NA,equal to more than 50 gallons for every,35
NA,man in Australia. The comparative,35
NA,"figure for 193S-39 was 90,000,000 gallons,",35
NA,or 28 gallons a man. Consumption of,35
NA,"spirits during 1950-51 was 2,900,000",35
NA,gallons. The figure for 1938-39 was,35
NA,"1,400,000 gallons. Cigarettes cleared",35
NA,from bond last year amounted to nearly,35
NA,"20,000,000 lb. compared with less than",35
NA,"7,000,000 lb. in 1938-39. There were",35
NA,"17,000,000 gallons of ice-cream produced",35
NA,in Australia last year compared with,35
NA,"4,300,000 gallons in 1938-39. This in-",35
NA,cidentally gives one clue to the reason for,35
NA,the decline of butter production. There,35
NA,"were 207,000 domestic refrigerators pro-",35
NA,duced in or imported into Australia last,35
NA,"year compared with 37,000 in 1938-39.",35
NA,"There were 128,000 new motor cars regis-",35
NA,"tered last year compared with 54,000 in",35
NA,1988-39.,35
NA,These are just a few examples drawn,35
NA,"from a wide range of items, all of which",35
NA,tell the same story. They show that,35
NA,"despite shortages, taxation and",35
NA,"prices, we, as a community, bave in many",35
NA,directions been doing ourselves extrahas been-,35
NA,ordinarily well. I t is against this back-,35
NA,ground of heavy consumption spending,35
NA,that the increases of sales tax and of,35
NA,customs and excise duties ought to bp,35

NA,taxa tion field as a whole it was evident,35
NA,"a that, of its main branches none could",35
NA,fairly claim to be exempt from some share,35
NA,of additional taxation. I have cited else-,36
NA,where the fact that national income rose,36
NA,"in 1950-51 by no less than £800,000,000,",36
NA,"or by 35 per cent, compared with that of",36

NA,"£90,000,000 and incomes of unincor-",36
NA,"porated businesses, professions and the",36
NA,"like by £80,000,000. Of individual,",36
NA,taxpayers witliin these broad groups,36
NA,"some, of course, fared differently from",36
NA,"others. The general position of all groups,",36
NA,"however, had been one of extraordinary",36
NA,buoyancy. I t was because the Govern-,36
NA,ment spread the additional taxation,36
NA,"widely, sought to correct inequalities",36
NA,in the taxation system and taxed spend-,36
NA,"ings rather than earnings, that it was",36
NA,able to keep the addition to direct taxation,36
NA,down to a moderate figure. No one could,36
NA,"say that, in a time like the present, to ask",36
NA,"a single man who earns £1,000 a year to",36
NA,pay an extra £13 10s. a year in taxation,36
NA,is to be unreasonable or extortionate.,36
NA,Even with the new scales operating such,36
NA,"a man, without dependants, who earns",36
NA,over £19 a week will pay somewhat less,36
NA,"than £3 a week. A married man,",36
NA,"with two children, who earns £19",36
NA,a week will pay well under £2 a,36
NA,"week. Let me point out, too, that very",36
NA,"many people, particularly those with",36
NA,"dependants, will still pay less in direct",36
NA,taxes than they would have paid on com-,36
NA,parable earnings at the time when the,36
NA,Labour Government left office.,36
NA,I have bad prepared tables which,36
NA,compare amounts of direct tax payable,36
NA,by persons on various income levels at the,36
NA,proposed rates with the tax payable on,36
NA,similar incomes at the rates in force,36
NA,during the last full year of Labour go-,36
NA,vernment. This comparison shows that,36
NA,for all except persons on very high levels,36
NA,"of income, tax at the proposed rates will",36
NA,still be appreciably lighter than it was,36
NA,then. . I ask for leave to incorporate the,36

NA,"On the whole, it is fair to claim that",36
NA,the Government has brought down a well-,36
NA,"balanced, fairly distributed scheme of",36
NA,taxation.. I t does not bear unduly on any,36
NA,class of taxayers. I t is absurd to pretend,36
NA,that in these times of high and rising,36
NA,incomes and heavy spending it need,36
NA,seriously discourage effort and enterprise,36
NA,or the will to save and invest. As the,36
NA,"scales I.have circulated show, our kinsmen",36
NA,in the United Kingdom and New Zealand,36
NA,are putting up with a' considerably,36
NA,heavier burden of taxation than we are,36
NA,"asked to bear, I know of nothing that",36
NA,sliows that their efforts in this time of,36
NA,"difficulty are any less willing, .or effec-",36
NA,"tive, than are ours.",36
NA,On the day after Cabinet had concluded,36
NA,its meetings to formulate the basic,36
NA,principles upon which the budget should,36
NA,"be framed, I received from the Minister",36
NA,"for Health ( Sir Earle Page), who was",36
NA,"then abroad, a copy of the Canadian",36
NA,Government's budget for the current,36
NA,"financial year, and I noted a remarkable",36
NA,similarity between it and our budget.,36
NA,The similarity was purely coincidental.,36
NA,Canada has no Professor Copland. The,36
NA,Canadian economy is in many ways like,36
NA,the Australian economy. Canada is a,36
NA,great primary producing country with a,36
NA,"big export trade, although, at the same",36
NA,"time, it is highly industrialized, as is",36
NA,Australia. Canadians are engaged on a,36
NA,large defence programme and they have,36
NA,"a problem of inflation, which springs",36
NA,broadly from the same causes as does in-,36
NA,flation here. They are grappling with the,36
NA,problem in much the same way as we are.,36
NA,They have rejected direct controls as being,36
NA,a stop-gap expedient which would not,36
NA,work. They are instead adopting,36
NA,measures to bring the supply of goods into,37
NA,balance with money demand. They are,37
NA,"budgeting for a surplus, restraining non-",37
NA,essential private investment and bank,37
NA,"lending, encouraging personal savings and",37
NA,limiting consumer credit. I n their budget,37
NA,tliis year they have imposed higher sales,37
NA,"tax. and excise duty, and a surtax not of",37
NA,"10 per cent, but of 20 per cent, on income",37
NA,"tax on individuals. I n brief, their whoie",37
NA,budget and plan of taxation was on the,37
NA,"same pattern as ours, even to details. I t",37
NA,seems signincant to me that the two coun-,37
NA,"tries, Canada and Australia, when faced",37
NA,"vvith the same problem, should inde-",37
NA,pendently have found their way to very,37
NA,much the same kind of solution.,37
NA,I now propose to comment on Common-,37
NA,wealth borrowing and conditions in the,37
NA,loan market. The misunderstanding of,37
NA,these matters is widespread. Questions,37
NA,in relation to them have been directed,37
NA,to me and there has been a good,37
NA,deal of discussion on them in the,37
NA,press and elsewhere. They also have con-,37
NA,siderable relevance to the financial,37
NA,measures which the Government has,37
NA,placed before the Parliament. Under the,37
NA,Financial Agreement the amounts which,37
NA,Commonwealth and State Governments,37
NA,seek to borrow each year for purposes,37
NA,"other than defence, and the terms and",37
NA,"conditions of such borrowing, are deter-",37
NA,"mined by the Australian Loan Council,",37
NA,which is a constitutional body. The,37
NA,States have a total of six votes and the,37
NA,Commonwealth two votes and a casting,37
NA,vote on the Loan Council. The Loan,37
NA,Council decides the total amount to be,37
NA,"borrowed in any financial year and then,",37
NA,"before each loan is floated, the Common-",37
NA,"wealth, as the borrowing instrumentality",37
NA,"under the Financial Agreement, consults",37
NA,with the States about the rate of interest,37
NA,and other conditions on wliich the loan,37
NA,shall be offered. This applies to both,37
NA,cash and conversion loans. Decisions on,37
NA,such matters require a majority vote of,37
NA,the Loan Council.,37
NA,I n fixing the rates of interest and,37
NA,conditions on which loans are offered to,37
NA,"the public, governments naturally seek to",37
NA,obtain the best terms possible having,37
NA,regard to the circumstances of the loan,37
NA,market and the amount of money they,37
NA,are. endeavouring to raise. This is a duty,37
NA,they have to perform in the interests of,37
NA,the taxpayers. Interest on public debt,37
NA,is an extremely large item in the budgets,37
NA,"of all governments, both Commonwealth",37
NA,"and State. The loan market, however, is",37
NA,a free market. I t is really a part of the,37
NA,general capital market in which govern-,37
NA,ments and other public authorities com-,37
NA,pete with business enterprises and other,37
NA,classes of borrowers for the money which,37
NA,tbe public and various financial institu-,37
NA,tions are offering for investment. The,37
NA,forces of supply and demand operate in,37
NA,this market just as in any other free,37
NA,"market and governments know that, apart",37
NA,from passing circumstances which may,37
NA,temporarily affect the position in one,37
NA,"way or another, they have to pay the rates",37
NA,of interest which the forces of supply and,37
NA,demand determine shall be paid. There,37
NA,"is, of course, a belief that governments",37
NA,can influence the loan market so as to,37
NA,secure the terms of borrowing they want;,37
NA,but this holds true only within very strict,37
NA,limits and is subject to many reservations.,37
NA,The market will undoubtedly be,37
NA,influenced very greatly by the amounts,37
NA,that governments seek to borrow. The,37
NA,"idea, however, is that by arbitrarily fixing",37
NA,"rates of interest and other terms, or by",37
NA,buying and selling securities on the stock,37
NA,"exchange, the Government can fix what-",37
NA,ever terms it likes for its own borrowing,37
NA,and hold them for as long as i t likes.,37
NA,From long experience i t can certainly be,37
NA,"said that this is not true unless, of course,",37
NA,central bank funds are drawn on to sup-,37
NA,"port the market, i f necessary to an",37
NA,unlimited amount.,37
NA,There is a good deal of official buying,37
NA,of securities on the market. The National,37
NA,Debt Sinking Fund Commission uses,37
NA,moneys that accrue to it to purchase Com-,37
NA,"monwealth securities, and so does the",37
NA,Commonwealth Savings Bank. This,37
NA,"official buying, the volume of which is",37
NA,varied from day to day according to,37
NA,"circumstances, serves a number of very",37
NA,useful purposes. I t helps to smooth out,37
NA,fluctuations in the market due to tem-,37
NA,other porary variations in the supply and,37
NA,demand for securities. This is of value,37
NA,both to governments as borrowers and to,37
NA,investors as holders or sellers of securities.,37
NA,I t ensures a continuous market for securi-,37
NA,"ties, which again is an advantage to",37
NA,investors. I t also spreads and evens out,37
NA,the impact on the market of government,37
NA,"operations. But it is obvious that, as the",38
NA,resources available to the National Debt,38
NA,Sinking Fund Commission and to the,38
NA,Commonwealth Savings Bank are com-,38
NA,"paratively limited, they would not be",38
NA,ficient to hold the market at any given,38
NA,level if the volume of securities offered,38
NA,for sale on the market were to continue,38
NA,for any length of time to be appreciably,38
NA,in excess of what buyers were prepared to,38
NA,take up.,38
NA,"During the war, the bond rate fell to",38
NA,"'di per cent., and a great deal of money",38
NA,was raised at that rate. War conditions,38
NA,"in the market were, of course, abnormal.",38
NA,The level of savings was high because,38
NA,people then had less opportunity to,38
NA,"spend than they had had in peace-time,",38
NA,and they also had a strong patriotic,38
NA,incentive to save. Other avenues for,38
NA,"investment, were drastically curtailed",38
NA,and war loan appeals were prosecuted,38
NA,vigorously. After the war both the rate,38
NA,of savings and the requirements of the,38
NA,Commonwealth for loan moneys were,38
NA,"reduced. Nevertheless, in April, 1947, it",38
NA,was found possible to issue loans at 3£,38
NA,"cent. Subsequently, eight conversion",38
NA,loans were floated at the rate of 3$ per,38
NA,"cent, with satisfactory results, and it was",38
NA,usual for cash loans to be over-subscribed.,38
NA,"As time went on, however, the require-",38
NA,ments of State governments and of semi-,38
NA,governmental bodies for loan moneys,38
NA,began to rise steeply. Their borrowings,38
NA,in successive years were as follows:-,38
NA,Year.,38
NA,1947-48 .. . . 7 3,38
NA,1048-40 . . 80,38
NA,1040-60 .. ..129,38
NA,1950-51 .. ..214,38
NA,Works programmes were being pushed,38
NA,ahead as fast as labour and materials,38
NA,"would allow that to be done, and with",38
NA,rising costs more money was required,38
NA,finance a given volume of construction.,38
NA,The recmirements of semi-governmental,38
NA,"bodies became increasingly important,",38
NA,"these bodies borrow on their own account,",38
NA,though under the general aegis of the,38
NA,"Loan Council, and often with a guarantee",38
NA,from the State governments concerned,38
NA,The rates they offer are as a rule,38
NA,appreciably higher than the bond rate.,38
NA,Along with increased public borrowing,38
NA,the demand for funds for private investthe,38
NA,ment also rose. Industry was expanding,38
NA,and costs were going up. Competition,38
NA,Sir Arthur Fadden.,38
NA,in the capital market for investable funds,38
NA,"became keener. Incomes rose steeply, but",38
NA,with heavy consumption spending savings,38
NA,tended to fall short of investment. There,38
NA,sufwas a very large inflow of funds from,38
NA,"overseas during 1948-49 and 1949-50,",38
NA,with a lesser inflow in 1950-51. But only,38
NA,a minor part of this money was for per-,38
NA,manent investment here. Some of it was,38
NA,undoubtedly used to buy Commonwealth,38
NA,securities but mainly with the idea of,38
NA,earning interest for a time and then re-,38
NA,selling as the funds were wanted for,38
NA,other purposes. By the middle of last,38
NA,year it had become apparent that the,38
NA,period of super-abundant loan money was,38
NA,"drawing to a close, and that was the",38
NA,view which the Commonwealth put to the,38
NA,"Loan Council in August, 1950. The State",38
NA,governments had brought forward loan,38
NA,programmes which showed a very large,38
NA,increase on their expenditure in the pre-,38
NA,vious year. With the rise of wool prices,38
NA,and the general upward movement of,38
NA,"wages, salaries and other incomes, a",38
NA,higher level of savings could be expected.,38
NA,"per At the same time, the competition of pri-",38
NA,vate enterprise for funds was becoming,38
NA,"more and more active, and there was a",38
NA,boom in share values.,38
NA,Borrowing possibilities in 1950-51 were,38
NA,complicated by the falling due of options,38
NA,"on a large block of 4 per cent, securities,",38
NA,"amounting to £129,000,000, a part of",38
NA,"which represented State debt, and a part",38
NA,Commonwealth debt. As the rate on these,38
NA,"£m. securities, which also carried a tax con-",38
NA,"cession, was considerably above the",38
NA,"current bond rate, it was obviously desir-",38
NA,"able to deal with them as early as possible,",38
NA,as the governments concerned had a legal,38
NA,"right to do, and the Loan Council was",38
NA,unanimously in favour of exercising that,38
NA,to right. Notice of redemption on the 2nd,38
NA,"January, 1951, accordingly was given,",38
NA,and conversion was offered at 3-§ per cent.,38
NA,There has been a good deal of criticism,38
NA,of this action from various ill-informed,38
NA,"quarters, and I might, in passing, refer to",38
NA,one or two aspects of the matter.,38
NA,-Since there was a substantial saving of,38
NA,interest to be made both for the Com-,38
NA,monwealth and for the State governments,38
NA,"concerned, it was clearly desirable that",38
NA,governments should act on their legal,38
NA,"rights, and their responsibilities to the",38
NA,"people generally, and convert these",38
NA,"securities, as far as possible, at tbe",39
NA,"vailing bond rate of interest, wbicb was",39
NA,3-J per cent. The governments concerned,39
NA,would have failed in their obligations to,39
NA,the taxpayers i f they had missed an,39
NA,"opportunity to do this, and they could",39
NA,hardly be expected to put the holders of,39
NA,"these securities into a special category,",39
NA,knowing that there was a definite,39
NA,covenant in connexion with them. I n the,39
NA,"event, the extent of conversion effected",39
NA,was highly satisfactory. Of the,39
NA,"£129,000,000 of outstanding securities,",39
NA,"some £103,000,000 was converted. I t was",39
NA,"voluntary conversion, not compulsory con-",39
NA,"version, as had been carried out by the",39
NA,Labour Government. I n the cash portion,39
NA,of the loan the amount received was,39
NA,"£44,000,000, as against the amount of",39
NA,"£21,000,000 asked for. This result can be",39
NA,taken to justify the issue of the loan at,39
NA,"the rate of 3£ per cent, and to demonstrate",39
NA,"that 3$ per cent, could, at the time, be",39
NA,properly regarded as the ruling rate of,39
NA,interest in the market.,39
NA,"I n the following months, despite sub-",39
NA,"stantial official buying, the prices of",39
NA,"government securities fell, and that",39
NA,decline meant a rise in the return to,39
NA,"buyers. I n March, the effective yield",39
NA,of long-dated securities touched £3 5s.,39
NA,"per cent. Some governmental bodies,",39
NA,which eighteen months earlier had been,39
NA,able to borrow all the money they,39
NA,"required at £3 3s. 9d. per cent., had to",39
NA,"pay £3 10s. per cent., which was the",39
NA,maximum rate that was then permitted,39
NA,under the National Security (Eco-,39
NA,nomic Organization) Eegulations for,39
NA,State-guaranteed loans. Even at that,39
NA,"rate of interest, those governmental",39
NA,bodies found it difficult to obtain,39
NA,their full requirements. I t was becoming,39
NA,clear that the change in the market,39
NA,was not due to temporary factors alone.,39
NA,Institutions such as insurance companies,39
NA,were showing a marked preference for,39
NA,securities with higher yields than were,39
NA,offered by Commonwealth bonds. The,39
NA,"share market, on which, in recent times,",39
NA,substantial capital gains had been made,39
NA,"from ordinary shares, was attracting much",39
NA,"of the money which, in other periods,",39
NA,would bave been invested in Common-,39
NA,wealth loans. From time to time fairly,39
NA,strong selling pressures became evident.,39
NA,Naturally the Commonwealth and the,39
NA,States viewed with reluctance the prospect,39
NA,preof an increase of the bond rate. How-,39
NA,"ever, by May it had become apparent that",39
NA,we could not hope to raise at an interest,39
NA,"rate of 3£ per cent, the amount that was",39
NA,required to complete the loan pro-,39
NA,grammes for the year. The Australian,39
NA,Loan Council decided that the loan,39
NA,should be issued at a discount of 1 per,39
NA,"cent., giving an effective yield of",39
NA,£3 4s. 4d. per cent. I t is true,39
NA,that the loan was over-subscribed by,39
NA,"some millions of pounds, but it is also true",39
NA,"that, even during the time the loan was",39
NA,"open, comparable long-dated securities",39
NA,were selling at prices that were ap-,39
NA,preciably below £99.,39
NA,At the special meeting of the Aus-,39
NA,"tralian Loan Council in June, the matter",39
NA,of interest rates was discussed at length.,39
NA,Most of the Premiers expressed strong,39
NA,"opposition, in principle, to a general",39
NA,"increase of interest rates, and certainly no",39
NA,one showed any enthusiasm for such a,39
NA,"move, but, nevertheless, it was recognized",39
NA,that the current trends of the market,39
NA,were strongly in that direction. Although,39
NA,the Premiers of the States were aware of,39
NA,"that position, they submitted to the",39
NA,Loan Council loan programmes that,39
NA,6d. would have involved a total government,39
NA,"borrowing of £300,000,000 this year, com-",39
NA,pared with an actual borrowing -of,39
NA,"£165,000,000 last year. I n addition, the",39
NA,programmes of semi-governmental autho-,39
NA,"rities for 1951-52 totalled £81,000,000",39
NA,"compared with raisings of £59,000,000 in",39
NA,1950-51.,39
NA,"Early in August, the yield of long-dated",39
NA,securities went as high as £3 17s. per,39
NA,"cent., and, despite a slight recovery, it was",39
NA,"plain that, for the loan in that month, we",39
NA,could not expect to get better terms than,39
NA,"£3 15s. per cent, at par. I t was necessary",39
NA,to issue a loan at that stage in order to,39
NA,obtain the money that was required for,39
NA,the works programmes of the State,39
NA,"governments, but it was recognized that",39
NA,various factors were operating to cause,39
NA,uncertainty and hesitation on the part of,39
NA,investors. Speculation was rife about,39
NA,the contents of the budget; the wool sales,39
NA,had opened unfavorably while the loan,39
NA,"was open; and there were, unfortunately,",39
NA,a number of forecasts that the interest,39
NA,rate would rise even higher. The loan,39
NA,"was undersubscribed by £7,500,000.",39
NA,I should like now to say a word about,40
NA,complaints by people wbo have incurred,40
NA,a capital loss on sales of Oommonwealth,40
NA,bonds. When people buy Commonwealth,40
NA,"bonds, they lend the money to the Govern-",40
NA,"ment for fixed periods, which are stated",40
NA,"in the bond, in return for interest at a",40
NA,-clearly defined rate. The Government's,40
NA,"obligation is to pay that interest, and,",40
NA,"at the end of the period, to return the",40
NA,monej that has been lent. The Govern-,40
NA,ment does not -undertake to redeem the,40
NA,bonds at face value whenever the holder,40
NA,"so desires, but i f , during the currency of",40
NA,"the bonds, an investor wishes to realize on",40
NA,"his holdings, he can do so by sale on the",40
NA,market at the price that otlier investors,40
NA,are at that time prepared to pay for the,40
NA,bonds. Shares are sold in the same way,40
NA,"-on the stock exchange. This price depends,",40
NA,"not on any government decision, but on",40
NA,the relative desire of people to buy and,40
NA,to sell at that time. I t is true that in,40
NA,recent times most issues of Common-,40
NA,wealth securities have been selling at,40
NA,prices below face value but it is equally,40
NA,true that on other occasions in the past,40
NA,such securities have for long periods sold,40
NA,at prices well in excess of face value.,40
Mr CALWELL ,Tha t occurred when,40
NA,Labour governments were in office.,40
Sir ARTHUR FADDEN ,D o not,40
NA,speak to me about what Labour govern-,40
NA,ments have done. As I have said,40
NA,"already, in order to ensure a continuous",40
NA,"market, the National Debt Sinking Fund",40
NA,Commission uses funds that accrue to it,40
NA,to purchase Commonwealth securities day,40
NA,by day on the stock exchange. The Com-,40
NA,monwealth Savings Rank of Australia,40
NA,uses a part of its accruing funds for,40
NA,"similar purposes. However, although",40
NA,those purchases constitute a valuable,40
NA,"-support to the prices of securities, the",40
NA,funds tha't are available are not un-,40
NA,"limited, and when, as occurred i n recent",40
NA,"months, investors dispose of Common-",40
NA,wealth securities on a large scale in,40
NA,"order to invest in other assets, it may",40
NA,be impossible to prevent such sales from,40
NA,depressing prices of Commonwealth,40
NA,:,40
NA,securities. The prices of long-term securi-,40
NA,ties are affected by movements of interest,40
NA,rates more than are prices of short-term,40
NA,securities. Business people who have,40
NA,funds to invest for short periods normally,40
NA,seek investments with currencies approxi-,40
NA,mately corresponding to those periods.,40
NA,"With this in mind, the Government has",40
NA,issued for many years short-term securi-,40
NA,ties as well as long-term securities. The,40
NA,short-term securities carry a lower interest,40
NA,"rate than do the long-term securities, but",40
NA,the holders of short-term moneys are able,40
NA,to invest with less risk of capital,40
NA,loss. Even i f the currencies of the new,40
NA,short-term securities that are regularly,40
NA,offered by the Government are unsuitable,40
NA,"to investors, the Government has aimed",40
NA,always to have on the market securities,40
NA,with - maturity dates spread to suit all,40
NA,classes of investors.,40
NA,A part of the recent losses suffered by,40
NA,individuals has undoubtedly been due to,40
NA,"the fact that some investors have, despite",40
NA,"the availability of short-term securities,",40
NA,invested short-term funds in long-term,40
NA,securities. They earned interest at the,40
NA,"higher rate while holding the securities,",40
NA,but there was the prospect of either a,40
NA,capital gain or a capital loss when it,40
NA,became necessary to sell. Those who had,40
NA,to sell recently suffered a capital loss.,40
NA,Following a thorough review of the,40
NA,whole situation the Commonwealth and,40
NA,"the States, as members of the Loan Coun-",40
NA,"cil, decided to issue the next loan at the",40
NA,same rates and on the same general terms,40
NA,as had applied to the last loan. We are,40
NA,confident that the investing public will,40
NA,"find those terms attractive, and will give",40
NA,to the loan the same generous support,40
NA,as they have accorded to the great,40
NA,majority of Commonwealth loans in past,40
NA,years.,40
NA,I t is not possible for me to reply to all,40
NA,the points of criticism-well-directe d and,40
NA,"mis-directed, well-informed and i l l -",40
NA,informed-tha t ihave been made in this,40
NA,debate. Clearly the Opposition has not,40
NA,known where it stands on the issue. The,40
NA,discomfort of Opposition members has,40
NA,been understandable. Not having minds,40
NA,"of their own on the subject, they looked",40
NA,"elsewhere for advice, and got more than",40
NA,they could assimilate. They have tuned,40
NA,in with one ear to the Sydney Morning,40
NA,"Herald, and with the other to the Premier",40
NA,of Victoria. The one demands a ruthless,40
NA,cutting down of public works; the other,40
NA,demands public works without a 1'mit.,40
NA,They have said that the budget is defla-,40
NA,"tionary, and that it is inflationary. The",40
NA,"honorable member for Melbourne, who is",40
NA,"their deputy leader, has decried the tax",40
NA,"increases. Yet it was he who promised,",41
NA,during the general election campaign last,41
NA,"April, to repeal the wool sales deduction",41
NA,legislation and to spread taxation over,41
NA,the whole community. Their household,41
NA,"economist, the honorable member for",41
NA,"Fremantle ( Mr Beazley), also deplored",41
NA,"the tax increases. I t was he who, at the",41
NA,Summer School of Political Science in,41
NA,"Perth this year, wanted to abolish sales",41
NA,tax-presumabl y on furs and jewellery,41
NA,as well as on the rest of the items in,41
NA,"the schedule-an d get the lost revenue,",41
NA,"of about £120,000,000, from higher direct",41
NA,taxation.,41
NA,:,41
NA,Speaker after speaker has denounced,41
NA,"the policy of a budget surplus, whilst",41
NA,"trying hard to forget that his late leader,",41
NA,"Mr Chifley, commended such a policy",41
NA,less than a year ago. Honorable mem-,41
NA,bers opposite have taken up the cudgels,41
NA,"for those unfailing friends of theirs, the",41
NA,"big wool-growers, against the averaging",41
NA,"proposal, which carefully preserves the",41
NA,position of the small producer every-,41
NA,"where, and in the final analysis protects",41
NA,all who have hitherto been advantaged,41
NA,under averaging. They have stood on,41
NA,their right leg and they have stood on,41
NA,"their left leg, but their shoes have kept",41
NA,'on pinching. They have got up and they,41
NA,have sat down. They have stammered,41
NA,"and shuffled and contradicted one another,",41
NA,"fried every line they could think of, and",41
NA,at the end of the debate they have still,41
NA,not known where or how to begin. They,41
NA,have scored not one effective point in,41
NA,whole discussion. They have shown,41
NA,-nothing except the complete incoherence,41
NA,"of their own thinking, and their lack of",41
NA,an intelligible policy on economic affairs.,41
NA,We may well ask what sort of budget a,41
NA,Labour government would have presented,41
NA,in the light of the election promises,41
NA,honorable gentleman opposite made,41
NA,"earlier this year, the attitudes they have",41
NA,revealed in this debate and the confusion,41
NA,which obviously exists amongst them on,41
NA,economic matters generally.,41
NA,. The most astonishing criticism I have,41
NA,heard concerns the policy of the Govern-,41
NA,ment on finance for housing. The Com-,41
NA,monwealth contribution to housing has,41
NA,been enormous. I n this financial year,41
NA,-the Government itself will provide be-,41
NA,"tween £50,000,000 and £60,000,000 for",41
NA,--housing and the Commonwealth Bank will,41
NA,[42],41
NA,provide a good many millions more. Under,41
NA,the Commonwealth and State Housing,41
NA,"Agreement, advances on relatively cheap",41
NA,terms are made to the four States which,41
NA,"participate, and the Commonwealth",41
NA,shares any losses involved in the letting,41
NA,"of houses by the States. Last year, the",41
NA,amount advanced to the States under the,41
NA,"housing agreement was £21,600,000. The",41
NA,Commonwealth' also subsidizes imported,41
NA,"prefabricated homes, and this year the",41
NA,amount included in the Estimates for this,41
NA,"subsidy is £2,600,000, which is sufficient to",41
NA,pay the maximum subsidy of £300 a house,41
NA,"on 8,600 houses. Apart from assistance",41
NA,"to State housing, the Commonwealth",41
NA,itself finances the building and acquisi-,41
NA,"tion of homes on a huge scale, principally",41
NA,through the War Service Homes Divi-,41
NA,"sion. Last year, this organization",41
NA,"provided 15,165 homes. I t built or",41
NA,"financed last year 11.6 per cent, of the",41
NA,"new houses 'built in Australia, and its",41
NA,"expenditure totalled £25,000,000. This",41
NA,"year, a further £25,000,000 is being pro-",41
NA,"vided for war service homes, and the",41
NA,amount of the maximum advance to build,41
NA,new homes has been increased from,41
NA,"£2,000 to £2,750. Included in the defence",41
NA,programme there is a considerable,41
NA,amount of housing for service personnel.,41
NA,There is also in our programme,41
NA,housing for postal and civil avia-,41
NA,"tion employees, and housing in the",41
NA,Australian Capital Territory and else-,41
NA,"where. A l l told, the Commonwealth has",41
NA,"the in hand a programme of housing, apart",41
NA,"from war service homes, which is esti-",41
NA,"mated to cost £9,500,000,",41
NA,"I n part, the criticism has been directed",41
NA,at what is termed the restriction of credit,41
NA,"for housing, and I want to make the",41
NA,position perfectly clear on that point.,41
NA,"First of all, there is the credit the Com-",41
NA,monwealth itself provides through ad-,41
NA,vances to States and for war service homes,41
NA,"which will total more than £50,000,000",41
NA,in the current financial year. Next there,41
NA,is the credit provided by the Common-,41
NA,"wealth Bank. Last year, the housing",41
NA,"division of the bank approved 3,400 new",41
NA,"housing loans totalling £4,800,000. Then,",41
NA,there is the accommodation provided by,41
NA,the Commonwealth Bank and Common-,41
NA,wealth Savings Bank for co-operative,41
NA,"building societies. Last year, the amount",41
NA,".was £8,300,000, which brought the total",41
NA,"for the last seven years to £36,700,000.",42
NA,".Finally, there is the matter of policy to-",42
NA,wards provision of housing finance by,42
NA,the trading banks. Under the advance,42
NA,policy instructions issued by the Com-,42
NA,monwealth Bank to the-trading banks the,42
NA,position is briefly this-,42
NA,(a) Banks may grant accommodation,42
NA,"to individuals up to £3,000 for",42
NA,"building homes for themselves,",42
NA,and this may be increased to,42
NA,"£3,500 where land on which the",42
NA,home is to be erected has to be,42
NA,bought;,42
NA,"(b) similarly, banks may grant accom-",42
NA,"modation up to £3,500 to in-",42
NA,dividuals to buy existing homes,42
NA,for their own use;,42
NA,(c) banks may finance co-operative,42
NA,building and co-operative hous-,42
NA,ing societies; and,42
NA,(d) builders and building companies,42
NA,may be financed for their short-,42
NA,term working requirements.,42
NA,I. fail to see that there is anything,42
NA,tive or illiberal in tliese. provisions. Even,42
NA,"with present prices aiid costs £3,500 is",42
NA,still a very substantial advance on a,42
NA,home. As regards co-operative building,42
NA,"and housing societies, the trading banks",42
NA,are freely permitted to lend to these,42
NA,bodies. Whether the banks undertake thia,42
NA,class of business is entirely a matter for,42
NA,themselves.,42
NA,"Outside Parliament, intense discussion",42
NA,of the budget has gone on. The budget,42
NA,has had its share of praise and its share,42
NA,of criticism. I would have been,42
NA,the last to expect it to escape,42
NA,criticism. Proposals so far-reaching,42
NA,were certain to provoke a diversity of,42
NA,views. The press has had some hard,42
NA,"things to say about the budget, but on",42
NA,the whole its commentary has been tem-,42
NA,"perate and fair, although I must say that",42
NA,there have been one or two conspicuous,42
NA,"exceptions. Like the Labour party, these",42
NA,journals have been somewhat incoherent.,42
NA,"They have cried deflation, and they havo",42
NA,cried inflation. They have predicted,42
NA,"ruin, and demanded that the budget be",42
NA,withdrawn-so giving the Labour party,42
NA,the idea for the amendment now before,42
NA,the committee-and in the same issue they,42
NA,have reported an improvement on the,42
NA,"stock exchange. They have said, some-",42
NA,"times in one and the same article, that the",42
NA,Sir Artlwr Fadden.,42
NA,budget surplus is much larger than ad-,42
NA,mitted and then that there is not really,42
NA,v,42
NA,"a surplus at all, and that the Government",42
NA,is straining its resources to make ends,42
NA,meet and avoid a deficit. They,42
NA,have demanded that .State works,42
NA,programmes be cut to the level of loan,42
NA,"raisings, whilst knowing full well that",42
NA,this would create a chaotic situation. I t,42
NA,is difficult not to think that some of thc,42
NA,more spiteful press attacks upon the,42
NA,budget are a pay-off for the refusal of the,42
NA,Government to appreciate the exchange,42
NA,rate by which the interests concerned,42
NA,would have profited enormously.,42
NA,The Government does not claim that the,42
NA,budget and the related measures it is,42
NA,taking will effect a complete and imme-,42
NA,"diate cure of inflation. After all, inflation",42
NA,has been going on in this country for the,42
NA,past twelve years. I t has gathered,42
NA,strength i n the course of time. Some of,42
NA,the dislocation it has caused will take a,42
NA,"long time to rectify. Moreover, some of",42
NA,restricthe forces now contributing to the,42
NA,"problem, of both overseas and local origin,",42
NA,may grow still stronger in the coming,42
NA,months. What the Government does,42
NA,"claim, however, is that the budget con-",42
NA,stitutes a major step towards the restora-,42
NA,"tion .of balance in our economy, that it",42
NA,will help towards greater concentration,42
NA,of resources on national tasks and that it,42
NA,will do these things without resort to,42
NA,extreme or disruptive action. I n parti-,42
NA,"cular, i t can be said of the budget that;-",42
NA,(a) it makes adequate provision for,42
NA,our defence responsibilities;,42
NA,"(6) it treats the States fairly, not to",42
NA,say generously;,42
NA,(c) it ensures that essential works in,42
NA,both Commonwealth and State,42
NA,programmes can be carried on;,42
NA,(d) i t meets the special position of war,42
NA,and civil pensioners;,42
NA,(e) it spreads equitably the burden of,42
NA,additional taxation having,42
NA,regard to the economic circum-,42
NA,stances of the time.,42
NA,I t is on these broad grounds that the,42
NA,budget should be judged. The Opposition,42
NA,has failed dismally to make out a case,42
NA,"against it. Therefore, the amendment",42
NA,before the committee should be rejected.,42
NA,I understand that the honorable mem-,42
NA,ber for Melbourne is now agreeable .to,42
NA,my having incorporated in Hansard the,42
NA,tax tables to which I referred earlier,43
NA,my speech. With the consent of the are as follows:-,43

Mr WARD ,East Sydney) [9.26] -,45
NA,"12 Since the presentation of the budget,",45
NA,Government spokesmen have endeavoured,45
NA,to arouse some enthusiasm for it by tell-,45
NA,ATES. ing the people that they would be worse,45
NA,off than tbey are i f Labour were in con-,45
NA,trol of the affairs of the country. The,45
NA,"Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden), in an",45
NA,Lawrence. W. R.,45
NA,"Leslie, H . A.",45
NA,"attempt to bolster the Government's case,",45
NA,cited some completely misleading figures,45
NA,when he referred to the position that,45
NA,existed at the time Labour was defeated,45
NA,"at the end of 1949. Prior to that time,",45
NA,Opperman. IT. F. there had been a succession of reductions,45
NA,"Osborne, F. M .",45
NA,in taxes. Those reductions would have con-,45
NA,Roberton. TI. S.,45
NA,"Ryan, R. S.",45
NA,tinued had Labour remained in office. I t,45
NA,must be remembered that Labour,45
NA,governed in Australia during the most,45
NA,"difficult war years, when all kinds of",45
NA,R. C -burdens were readily shouldered by the,45
NA,Wight. B . M . community. To-day we are not at war,45
NA,Wilson. K . C.,45
NA,but at peace. During thegeneral election,45
NA,"Tellers: campaign of 1949, the people of this'",45
NA,"country, who had endured the stresses and",45
NA,"strains of the war, little realized that",45
NA,NOES.,45
NA,after two years of rule by an anti-Labour,45
NA,Government they would be asked to bear,45
NA,the colossal burden of taxation that they,45
NA,are being asked to bear now.,45
NA,The proper approach to this matter is,45
NA,"to ask, first, whether increased taxes are",45
NA,"necessary; and secondly, whether the Go-",45
NA,Mnlcnhy. D.,45
NA,Mullens. J. M .,45
NA,"vernment is distributing the added burden,",45
NA,"in an equitable manner. The Treasurer,",45
NA,by referring to what the Government is,45
NA,"doing in regard to company profits, has",45
NA,endeavoured to persuade the people that,45
NA,Thompson. A. V.,45
NA,Ward. E. .T.,45
NA,the big companies of this country are,45
NA,"being dealt with savagely, but the re-",45
NA,actions of the stock exchange indicate,45
NA,Teller*:,45
NA,that those companies are very pleased,45
NA,with this Government and with its taxa-,45
NA,tion proposals. The Treasurer said that,45
NA,PAIRS. the Labour party had made several,45
NA,changes of front. Let me remind the,45
NA,House of a change of front by the,45
NA,Treasurer in regard to the proposed excess,45
NA,profits tax. During the general elections of,45
NA,".1949 and 1951, we heard a great deal about",45
NA,what the present Government parties pro-,46
NA,posed to do in regard to the exorbitant,46
NA,and greatly increased profits that were,46
NA,being made by companies in this country.,46
NA,"On the 10th October, 1950, I directed to",46
NA,the Prime Minister ( Mr Menzies) a,46
NA,question about the Government's pro-,46
NA,mise to introduce a system of profit,46
NA,sharing. I n the course of his reply to,46
NA,"the question, the right honorable gentle-",46
NA,man said-,46
NA,I am aware that I indicated recently,46
NA,Government proposed to introduce an excess,46
NA,"profits tax, and that that proposal brought",46
NA,down the most bitter criticism by the,46
NA,honorable member for Barton.,46
NA,Earlier the honorable member for Melwas,46
NA,bourne ( Mr Calwell) had sought inthe,46
NA,formation about the proposed excess,46
NA,profits tax. Before I conclude my speech,46
NA,I shall endeavour to show that the charge,46
NA,of the Opposition -that this is a rich,46
NA,"man's government, and that the budget",46
NA,"is a rich man's budget, can be proved",46
NA,by the evidence that I shall submit. The gentleman said-,46
NA,honorable member for Melbourne asked,46
NA,the Treasurer whether it was his intenpart,46
NA,tion to introduce during that sessional,46
NA,period the legislation to impose a tax considered.,46
NA,on excess profits to which he had referred,46
NA,in his budget speech. The Treasurer quarters,46
NA,then replied-,46
NA,The reply to the honorable member's quesHe,46
NA,"tion is "" Y e s "" .",46
NA,The right honorable gentleman did not,46
NA,say that the Government was investigatprofits,46
NA,ing the matter in order to ascertain,46
NA,whether such a measure could be introcontribution,46
NA,duced. He spoke as though the Governshall,46
NA,ment had already made a decision,46
NA,"the subject. Again, on the 1st December,",46
NA,"1950, the honorable member for Mel9s.",46
NA,bourne asked the Treasurer what he,46
NA,proposed to do about the imposition,46
NA,an excess profits tax. The right honorthey,46
NA,able gentleman replied-,46
NA,Certain difficulties have arisen with respect,46
NA,to the drafting of the proposed legislation,46
NA,"impose a tax on excess profit"". That matter",46
NA,as a whole was referred to the expert,46
NA,"mittee on taxation, which is the most",46
NA,priate body to investigate in detail a complex,46
NA,question of that kind. . . . I am,46
NA,console the honorable memher by assuring,46
NA,that although it will be impossible to,46
NA,duce the relevant legislation during thi= period,46
NA,of the current session that fact,46
NA,advantage* those wlio will come within,46
NA,scope because it will be made retrospective,46
NA,the 1st July last . . .,46
NA,Mr Ward.,46
NA,"I remind honorable members that that,",46
NA,"was said on the 1st July, 1950. The",46
NA,Treasurer continued-,46
NA,and w i l l be based on profits of the current,46
NA,year or for the accounting year that the Com-,46
NA,missioner for Taxation accepts i n substitution,46
NA,therefor.,46
NA,Instead of introducing a measure to im-,46
NA,"pose an excess profits tax, however, the *",46
NA,Treasurer introduced a budget which,46
NA,"deals very lightly with the big companies,",46
NA,as I shall show in a moment. Even in,46
NA,that the his budget speech the right honorable,46
NA,gentleman still persisted in stating that,46
NA,right the Government proposed to introduce,46
NA,an excess profits tax. That statement,46
NA,made to silence the opposition to,46
NA,Government that was being aroused,46
NA,by persons outside this Parliament who,46
NA,found that the higher prices charged for,46
NA,their every-day needs were leading to,46
NA,greatly increased profits by practically,46
NA,every commercial and manufacturing con-,46
NA,cern in Australia. The right honorablp,46
NA,"I n my last budget speech I stated that, a?",46
NA,of a balanced plan to bring inflationary,46
NA,"forces under control, measures to draw off",46
NA,some part of abnormal profits were being,46
NA,This statement has been interpreted in some,46
NA,to mean that the Government pro-,46
NA,posed an excess profits tax on a l l forms of,46
NA,business profits.,46
NA,spoke of the difficulties that; prevented ',46
NA,the introduction of such a measure and,46
NA,how impossible it was to apply an excess,46
NA,tax equitably. He continued-,46
NA,The Government proposes that the additional,46
NA,to revenue by public companies,46
NA,be i n the form of a special levy at the,46
NA,on rate of 2s. in the f l .,46
NA,Public companies are to be asked to pay,46
NA,"in the f l , but they already pay tax",46
NA,at that rate on a great deal of their,46
NA,"of profits, because under the present law",46
NA,"pay 5s. in the f 1 on the first f 5,000",46
NA,"of profit, 6s. in the f l on all profit in",46
NA,"excess of the first £5,000, a super tax",46
NA,to of Is. in the £1 on profit in excess of,46
NA,"£5,000, and 2s. in the £1 on undistributed",46
NA,"comprofits. What "" colossal"" burden has the",46
NA,approTreasurer imposed on the great com-,46
NA,able to panies that make enormous profits out,46
NA,him of the exploitation of the people? I n,46
NA,introhis budget speech he said that estimated,46
NA,increased taxation this year would be,46
NA,will not £160.000.000. He continued-,46
NA,its,46
NA,to By imposing these rates and abolishing the,46
NA,super-tax and undistributed inoome tax the,46
NA,net yield in a full assessment year will be,47
NA,"£13,000,000 and in this financial year",47
NA,"£10,900,000.",47
NA,"Approximately only 7 per cent, of the",47
NA,additional increased tax proposed i n the,47
NA,budget is to be met by the taxation of the,47
NA,enormous pronts earned by great public,47
NA,companies! Is it any wonder that the,47
NA,directors of those companies are satisned,47
NA,with the Government and the budget and,47
NA,that the stock exchange is buoyant? The,47
NA,Treasurer lias gone further and has dis-,47
NA,criminated in favour of the larger com-,47
NA,panies. I do not suggest that the smaller,47
NA,public companies that are struggling for,47
NA,their very existence can expect to be,47
NA,"befriended by the Government, because it",47
NA,is the representative of big business and,47
NA,it wants to destroy small businesses in,47
NA,order to assist the great monopolies. A,47
NA,.small public company that earns a profit,47
NA,"of £5,000 in a year is at present taxed at",47
NA,"->s. in the f l , or a total amount of f1,250.",47
NA,r,47
NA,Under the pvesent proposal the special,47
NA,provision relating to such companies is to,47
NA,be wiped out and small companies in,47
NA,common witb large companies will be,47
NA,called upon to pay 9s. in the f l . A small,47
NA,company of the kind I have mentioned,47
NA,will now be obliged to pay a tax amount-,47
NA,"ing to £2,250, or an increase of 80 per",47
NA,"cent, on present rates. Let us consider",47
NA,the case of a compauy of somewhat larger,47
NA,"dimensions, which earns a profit of",47
NA,"620,000 a year and pays half of its profits",47
NA,in dividends and carries the other half to,47
NA,reserve. TJnder the existing law such a,47
NA,company would pay os. in the £.1 on the,47
NA,"first £5,000 of income, or £1,250; 6s. in",47
NA,"the £1 on £15,000, or £4,500; ls. in the",47
NA,"€1 on £15.000, or £750; and 2s. in the £1",47
NA,"ou the £10,000 placed in reserve, or",47
NA,"61,000; or a' total tax of £7,500. TJnder",47
NA,the new tax rates such a company will,47
NA,"pay £9,000, or an increase of only 20 per",47
NA,"cent, compared with an 80 per cent,",47
NA,increase in the case of the small company.,47
NA,Let us now consider the case of a large,47
NA,company wliich earns a profit of approxi-,47
NA,"mately £500,000 a year, of which it",47
NA,"distributes £200,000 in dividends and",47
NA,places tbe remainder in reserve. TJnder,47
NA,existing rates such a company would pay,47
NA,"a. total tax of £204,500. TJnder the new",47
NA,"proposals it will pay £225,000, or an",47
NA,"increase of 10 per cent. Thus, the higher",47
NA,tho earnings of the great monopolistic,47
NA,concerns the more leniently are they,47
NA,treated by the Government which tries to,47
NA,make the Australian people believe that,47
NA,it is applying the tax. burden equitably.,47
NA,"The Treasurer, obviously realizing that",47
NA,there would be some criticism of these,47
NA,"proposals, had this to say in his budget",47
NA,speech-,47
NA,Both super tax and undistributed incomo tax,47
NA,were war-time measures.,47
NA,The right honorable gentleman un-,47
NA,doubtedly seeks to justify the wiping out,47
NA,of those taxes on the ground that we are,47
NA,no longer at war. On the one hand he,47
NA,"says to the workers, "" You must accept a",47
NA,greater tax burden because of the war,47
NA,preparations in which the .country is now,47
NA,"involved "". On the other hand he justifies",47
NA,the lifting of the burden of taxation on,47
NA,the great monopolies on the ground that,47
NA,the war has ended. Surely the right,47
NA,honorable gentleman will admit his,47
NA,inconsistency. I do not > suggest that any,47
NA,of our great companies will be seriously,47
NA,inconvenienced by the slight additional,47
NA,burden of taxation that they will now be,47
NA,called upon to bear. We all are aware,47
NA,that iu the final analysis the increased,47
NA,taxes will be paid by the worker because,47
NA,this additional impost will eventually be,47
NA,added to the prices of commodities,47
NA,bought by the worker. Political parties,47
NA,in this Parliament and elsewhere repre-,47
NA,sent particular interests. The Govern-,47
NA,ment parties represent the big business,47
NA,interests of this country. I n order to,47
NA,prove the truth of that assertion I do not,47
NA,have to depend on the statements of,47
NA,members of my own party or of the bodies,47
NA,with which it is affiliated. I can prove its,47
NA,truth by quoting the words of honorable,47
NA,members in the ranks of the Government.,47
NA,I refer in particular to the Minister for,47
NA,Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr.,47
NA,MCEwen). During the Menzies regime,47
NA,in 1939 when members of the Australian,47
NA,Country party were not members of tbe,47
NA,Government but were merely supporters,47
NA,"of it, they were occasionally frank",47
NA,in their expressions of opinion in,47
NA,this House. The present Minister for,47
NA,Commerce and Agriculture said on one,47
NA,"occasion, when he was speaking during",47
NA,the debate on the-Supply and Develop-,47
NA,"ment Bill 1939, just prior to the out-",47
NA,break of war-,47
NA,I very much doubt whether the big business,47
NA,"interests of this country, with whom the",47
NA,present Government has a not too remote con-,48
NA,"nexion, will relish contemplating the handing",48
NA,over to a Minister for Supply drawn from the,48
NA,ranks of honorable members opposite this most,48
NA,complete authority to demand information con-,48
NA,cerning the innermost secrets of the big indus-,48
NA,trial enterprises of Australia. These big,48
NA,business interests w i l l - n ot contemplate with,48
NA,any jubilation the possibility of a Minister i n,48
NA,"a government formed by, honorable members",48
NA,opposite probing to the very depths the secrets,48
NA,of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company,48
NA,"Limited, the Broken H i l l Proprietary Company",48
NA,"Limited, General Motors-Holden Limited, and",48
NA,other companies. I t is a very interesting pos-,48
NA,"sibility to contemplate, and I am not sure",48
NA,that some of my friends who were responsible,48
NA,for the drafting of this bill w i l l not,48
NA,selves hauled over the coals by their masters.,48
NA,There are many honorable members oppo-,48
NA,site who sat behind the right honorable,48
NA,member for Kooyong ( Mr Menzies),48
NA,"when he was Prime Minister in 1939, who",48
NA,"will not deny that they had, and,",48
NA,"indeed, still retain, a very close con-",48
NA,nexion with big business. When the,48
NA,Minister for Commerce and Agriculture,48
NA,made that statement in 1939 he was,48
NA,castigating a government that was led by,48
NA,the same right honorable gentleman who,48
NA,"leads the present Government, and which",48
NA,was of the same political colour as the,48
NA,present Government. He was frank,48
NA,enough then to admit that that govern-,48
NA,ment had a very close connexion with,48
NA,big business. So has the present Govern-,48
NA,"ment. As a matter of fact, we have",48
NA,"endeavoured, by means of questions, to",48
NA,establish that some members of the,48
NA,present Government still retain con-,48
NA,nexions with big business interests in this,48
NA,"country while, as members of the",48
NA,"Cabinet, they are supposed to be serving",48
NA,tbe community generally and not serving,48
NA,sectional interests only. We have had,48
NA,great dimculty in establishing that fact,48
NA,only because of the failure of Ministers to,48
NA,answer questions that we have directed,48
NA,to them about it.,48
NA,The companies to which I have referred,48
NA,are doing very well under the present,48
NA,"regime. They are making provision, in",48
NA,"advance, to meet their taxes. They do not",48
NA,pay their taxes out of profit after it is,48
NA,"- earned. Instead, they budget in advance",48
NA,to cover the taxes that they are likely to,48
NA,be called upon to pay in the succeeding,48
NA,- twelve months. I shall give one illustra-,48
NA,tion of that fact from the official record,48
NA,- of the stock exchange for last August.,48
NA,- The company concerned is Noyes,48
NA,Mr Ward.,48
NA,Brothers (Melbourne) Limited. This is,48
NA,what the chairman of directors of that,48
NA,company had to say-,48
NA,I n providing for taxation the directors have,48
NA,had in mind the statements which have been,48
NA,made that the rate of company tax may be,48
NA,increased.,48
NA,So that company was actually making,48
NA,provision for the increased taxes that it,48
NA,expected to be imposed by the Govern-,48
NA,ment. As a result of the methods that,48
NA,companies employ in relation to taxes,48
NA,the workers of this country are being ex-,48
NA,"ploited as never before. Big business,",48
NA,"find themwhich is supported by the Government,",48
NA,adopts all sorts of snide methods to keep,48
NA,from the general public a knowledge of,48
NA,the exact position in regard to the profit,48
NA,"earning of large companies. Eor instance,",48
NA,companies have all sorts of ways of boost-,48
NA,"ing what they term "" the business expense",48
NA,"account"". I f the wife of a director of a",48
NA,"company wants a new motor car, i t is",48
NA,bought and put down on the business,48
NA,expense account. I f a director wants a,48
NA,"new motor car for himself, or wishes to",48
NA,entertain his friends at some fashionable,48
NA,"hotel, or to pay a visit overseas, the",48
NA,expenditure on the item is added to the,48
NA,business expense account. The worker,48
NA,"in industry,. the real producer who is",48
NA,always - being lectured on. the need to,48
NA,"work harder and produce more, is the",48
NA,-person upon whom this country entirely,48
NA,depends for its existence.,48
NA,"Let us examine how one big company,",48
NA,the Broken H i l l Proprietary Company,48
NA,"Limited, is faring. Last year it made a",48
NA,"profit of £1,723,000, after having set aside",48
NA,"£1,209,000 for depreciation and £1,000,000",48
NA,for taxation. The worker is taxed right,48
NA,at the source. He has his taxes deducted,48
NA,"from his pay, and he cannot pass on",48
NA,to anybody else what he has lost in,48
NA,taxation. He has no opportunity to,48
NA,budget to meet tax payments in the same,48
NA,way as the great companies can do it.,48
NA,Therefore I say that it is entirely wrong,48
NA,to tax workers who earn below the basic,48
NA,"wage, because the basic wage is deter-",48
NA,mined by an authority which decides,48
NA,what shall be a mere subsistence wage for,48
NA,"a man, wife and child. That authority,",48
NA,"the Commonwealth Arbitration Court,",48
NA,does not take into account any tax pay-,48
NA,ments that a man may have to make.,48
NA,"So,, when additional taxes are im-",48
NA,"posed on the workers, who are now having",48
NA,"a terrific struggle to exist, a great burden",49
NA,"is imposed on them, and their living",49
NA,"standard is, in effect, reduced. But i f a",49
NA,higher rate of tax is imposed on a,49
NA,person who already has more money than,49
NA,"he needs or can spend, no real burdeu",49
NA,is imposed on him. I shall show honor-,49
NA,able members how the Government's scale,49
NA,of taxes on personal income works in,49
NA,"favour of wealthy people. By doing so,",49
NA,.[ shall rebut the false arguments that,49
NA,honorable members opposite have based,49
NA,on incorrect comparisons between the tax,49
NA,policy of the Labour party when it was in,49
NA,oifice and the tax policy of the present,49
NA,Government. An examination of the,49
NA,results of the Government's tax policy,49
NA,could lead to no other conclusion than,49
NA,that the Government is favouring the,49
NA,wealthy section of the community. When,49
NA,we were in office our taxation methods,49
NA,were entirely different from those adopted,49
NA,"by this Government, At one stage during",49
NA,the last war the rate of tax on large,49
NA,incomes was as high as 18s. 6d. in the,49
NA,£ 1. That rate applied to incomes of over,49
NA,"£5,000 a year, and was applied right",49
NA,"through the scale of income. I t did nor,",49
NA,matter how much a man received above,49
NA,"£5,000, he had to pay the maximum rate",49
NA,of tax on his total income.,49
NA,"Last year, on the plea that it was",49
NA,"simplifying tax methods, the Govern-",49
NA,"ment, without drawing very much atten-",49
NA,"tion to its action, adopted a new system",49
NA,which the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden),49
NA,said was a method of imposing taxa-,49
NA,tion in steps. TJnder that system the,49
NA,lower down the scale of income a man is.,49
NA,the shorter the steps are. On the higher,49
NA,levels tbe rate of tax increases with every,49
NA,"£2,000 of income earned, whereas on the",49
NA,lower income ranges it increases with,49
NA,every £50 of income earned. I shall tell,49
NA,the House what a great advantage the,49
NA,use of that method gives to the people who,49
NA,earn the very highest range of income.,49
NA,"As I have said, under the Labour Govern-",49
NA,"ment, a person paid the same rate of tax",49
NA,right through the whole range of his,49
NA,income. TJnder this provision £he rate of,49
NA,"tax increases by various steps, so that a",49
NA,"man who earns £10,000 or £20,000 a",49
NA,year will pay on the first £100 of his,49
NA,"income only l d . in the £1, which is the",49
NA,same rate as is paid by a man on the,49
NA,lowest range of income. Then for the,49
NA,next £50 the rate' goes up to l i d . in the,49
NA,"£1, and so up the scale until he gets to the",49
NA,rate of 15s. in the £1 after the first,49
NA,"£10,000. He does not pay 15s. in the £1",49
NA,in respect of the whole of his income.,49
NA,The rate goes up by stages. I shall,49
NA,"take, as a typical case, a man with",49
NA,"an income of £12,000, who, under",49
NA,"the scale that is operating at the moment,",49
NA,"would be liable to pay £5,621 in tax on the",49
NA,"first £10,000, and 15s. in the £1 on the",49
NA,"remaining £2,000 of his income, making",49
NA,"a total tax liability of £7,121 13s. 4d. I f",49
NA,the Labour Government's old system had,49
NA,been operating he would have been paying,49
NA,15s. in the £1 in respect of the whole,49
NA,"£12,000, which would have meant",49
NA,"that he would pay £9,000 in tax.",49
NA,"That represents a saving of £1,879 to",49
NA,"the man on an income of £12,000 a year.",49
NA,"Even with the 10 per cent, increase this",49
NA,year he will still be saving compared with,49
NA,vvhat he would have had to pay had the,49
NA,maximum scale applied to his entire,49
NA,income. Can there be any wonder that,49
NA,people in fortunate circumstances in this,49
NA,country are rather delighted with the Go-,49
NA,vernment. When the Treasurer compared,49
NA,the taxes paid by workers to-day with,49
NA,those paid when the Labour Government,49
NA,was in office he did not state the position,49
NA,fairly. I t is true .that controls were,49
NA,"exercised by the Labour Government, but",49
NA,at least workers could buy commodities,49
NA,at fixed prices and get a fair share of,49
NA,goods that were in short supply. TJnder,49
NA,this Government's system the basic wage,49
NA,"is fixed on prices for which, in many",49
NA,"instances, goods cannot be procured.",49
NA,Anybody who lives in the cities or is at,49
NA,all realistic knows that workers are com-,49
NA,pelled to pay more than the fixed prices,49
NA,if they want .to buy some scarce com-,49
NA,modities. Price-fixing is not properly,49
NA,policed and cannot be applied effectively,49
NA,by the State governments. This Govern-,49
NA,ment .aims to avoid Commonwealth,49
NA,prices control because it knows,49
Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. Archie,49
NA,Cameron) -Order ! The honorable mem-,49
NA,"ber is getting away from the bill, which",49
NA,is a taxation measure.,49
Mr WARD , I shall return to the,49
NA,taxation field. When Labour was. in,49
NA,"office, a worker who was earning £340 a",49
NA,"year, which was approximately the base",49
NA,"rate, paid £15 a year in tax. This year,",49
NA,a worker who receives the base rate of,49
NA,£538 a year willpay £45 in income tax,50
NA,"and, as I have shown, he will be relatively",50
NA,much worse off. The same discrepancy,50
NA,is obvious right throughout the lower,50
NA,income scale. Everybody in this country,50
NA,knows that no man can exist and main-,50
NA,tain a family on the prevailing basic,50
NA,"wage. What is happening, of course, is",50
NA,"that bread-winners are working overtime,",50
NA,and in many cases the members of,50
NA,the family have to go to work to,50
NA,supplement the household income. They,50
NA,can do that at present because of,50
NA,"the great demand for labour but, if",50
NA,families were forced to exist on the basic,50
NA,"wage, starvation would result because the",50
NA,"basic wage, reduced by this Government's",50
NA,"tax imposts, is insufficient to meet the",50
NA,needs of a family.,50
NA,The Treasurer invited the Opposition,50
NA,to show how the proposed tax increases,50
NA,could be avoided. He complained that no,50
NA,constructive suggestions had been made,50
NA,from the Labour side of the chamber. I,50
NA,propose to make a few now. The Govern-,50
NA,ment is budgeting for a surplus. Tbe,50
NA,Treasurer's excuse for doing so is that,50
NA,Australia is following the example,50
NA,set by Canada. The right honorable,50
NA,"gentleman did not refer to New Zealand,",50
NA,"of course, because in that country where",50
NA,the Administration is faced with the,50
NA,identical problems-includin g increasing,50
NA,defence expenditure-tha t confront this,50
NA,"Government, taxes are being reduced. I t",50
NA,is ridiculous to argue that inflation can,50
NA,be met by increasing taxes. We have,50
NA,been told repeatedly that the only real,50
NA,counter to inflation is to increase produc-,50
NA,"tion, and that production can be increased",50
NA,only if the right incentives are provided.,50
NA,Will higher taxes give an incentive to,50
NA,increase production ? Even the Prime,50
NA,Minister ( Mr Menzies) in the 1949 elec-,50
NA,tion campaign conceded that a reduction,50
NA,oftaxes was essential to stimulate pro-,50
NA,duction. He said-,50
NA,"It hiis, by way of outstanding example, been",50
NA,most reluctant to grapple with the problem,50
NA,of tax reduction. This is partly because it,50
NA,seems to believe that Government,50
NA,can spend our earnings for us more wisely,50
NA,than we can (which is a common,50
NA,"delusion), and, therefore, that it is more",50
NA,important to maintain Government,50
NA,ture than to reduce the taxes which,50
NA,them; and partly because the Government has,50
NA,never come to understand that real tax reduc-,50
NA,tions would be the best of all incentives to,50
NA,"increased effort, earnings and production.",50
NA,Mr Ward.,50
NA,That statement was made by the P*ime,50
NA,Minister who now uses exactly the oppo-,50
NA,site argument. The Government is say-,50
NA,"ing to the people, "" We have to draw",50
NA,off some of your surplus funds to meet the,50
NA,"inflationary situation "". I t is quite true",50
NA,that i f surplus money is abroad in the,50
NA,community the demand for scarce com-,50
NA,"modities will be accentuated, but how will",50
NA,"inflation be reduced if the Government,",50
NA,after drawing off the surplus spending,50
NA,"power, itself expends that money, and",50
NA,-thus does exactly what the Prime Minis-,50
NA,ter complained about in the 1949 election,50
NA,campaign? To-day the right honorable,50
NA,gentleman is saying to the Australian,50
NA,"people, "" We can expend the money much",50
NA,more efficiently and much more satisfac-,50
NA,"torily than you can "". I am not arguing",50
NA,that there is no surplus money in the,50
NA,community. I f the volume of money is,50
NA,"continually increasing, it must have some",50
NA,effect on prices unless there is a corre-,50
NA,"sponding increase of production, but",50
NA,surely the Government's plan sbould not,50
NA,be to draw money away from people who,50
NA,cannot spare it. Obviously people in tbe,50
NA,lower income groups have no surplus,50
NA,funds. With the high cost of living to-,50
NA,"day, many of them have a great struggle",50
NA,"to make ends meet. The Government,",50
NA,ehould draw surplus money from the,50
NA,people who have too much but that is,50
NA,just what it does not propose to do. I t,50
NA,will not take surplus money from the,50
NA,wealthy monopolies to wbich I have re-,50
NA,ferred. Of the estimated increase of,50
NA,"£160,000,000 in taxation revenue this",50
NA,"year, the wealthy companies will contri-",50
NA,bute only 7 per cent. Let us see what thc,50
NA,Treasurer himself has said. [Quorum,50
NA,-formed.] His views in 1949 were similar,50
NA,to those held by the present Prime Min-,50
NA,ister. He said-,50
NA,The Chifley Government might blame the coal-,50
NA,"miners, wharflabourers, or the Communists foi'",50
NA,"the slowing down of production, but i t alone",50
NA,is responsible for the paralysing effect of,50
NA,restrictive taxation.,50
NA,The Government's policy of maintaining,50
NA,departments taxation at unduly high levels has killed the,50
NA,"incentive to produce. This, in turn, has con-",50
NA,"Socialist tributed to industrial dislocation, absenteeism,",50
NA,spasmodic stoppages of work and a general,50
NA,expendi- disinclination to work overtime.,50
NA,maintain,50
NA,"Therefore, substantial and immediate taxa-",50
NA,tion reductions must be made to remedy tht,50
NA,country's economic ills.,50
NA,The most practical way to alleviate industrial,51
NA,unrest and encourage full employment is by,51
NA,a substantial reduction of individual taxation.,51
NA,Tax reduction is the most effective way of,51
NA,increasing wages. Every penny taken from,51
NA,a pay envelope by the Government represents,51
NA,a reduction in wages.,51
NA,That is the Opposition's contention.,51
NA,But there will not be any reduction of,51
NA,dividends. I challenge the Government to,51
NA,produce any recent instance of a company,51
NA,which has been compelled to reduce its,51
NA,dividend rate because its pronts have,51
NA,"fallen, or any instance of a company",51
NA,wbich will have to reduce its dividend,51
NA,rate because of the present taxation pro-,51
NA,posals. The people who draw dividends,51
NA,from these great companies will find,51
NA,greater amounts going into reserves and,51
NA,greater profits being earned. Their,51
NA,incomes will not be affected by tbe pro-,51
NA,posals of tbe Government. Only the,51
NA,workers who have no way of passing the,51
NA,taxation on will be affected by these,51
NA,.proposals.,51
NA,The Treasurer has cited figures in,51
NA,regard to the increased profits of the,51
NA,great companies. He said that during,51
NA,the last financial year they earned an,51
NA,"additional £90,000,000 in profit. Of that",51
NA,amount the Government has proposed to,51
NA,"take £10,900,000, but that amount will not",51
NA,be taken from the individual share-,51
NA,holders. The proposal will result in only,51
NA,a small token payment being made from,51
NA,the inflated pronts of these companies.,51
NA,The workers have been very harshly,51
NA,treated by the Governm.ent. The pro-,51
NA,posed taxation is inequitable. The,51
NA,Treasurer has stated that the Govern-,51
NA,ment's policy is to tax spending rather,51
NA,than earning. The result of such a,51
NA,policy will be that workers who maintain,51
NA,families will have to pay a dispropor-,51
NA,tionate amount of the tax because they,51
NA,"are compelled to spend all their income,",51
NA,"in most cases, in order to exist. The",51
NA,honorable member for Fremantle ( Mr.,51
NA,Beazley) was criticized by the Treasurer,51
NA,because he advocated the abolition of the,51
NA,sales tax. I consider that the sales tax,51
NA,should be abolished. The Treasurer has,51
NA,proposed that the taxation burden on,51
NA,"large companies should be eased, on the",51
NA,plea that such taxes were imposed as a,51
NA,war-time measure. Was not the sales,51
NA,tax imposed as a war-time measure in the,51
NA,first instance? Surely this tax which,51
NA,was imposed in order to provide some,51
NA,of the finance for World War I . could,51
NA,be removed now that so many years have,51
NA,passed since that war terminated.,51
NA,Indirect taxation bears most heavily on,51
NA,the worker and the family man. The,51
NA,fairest method of taxation has always,51
NA,been a direct tax on a graduated scale,51
NA,according to the ability of the individual,51
NA,to pay.,51
NA,Beference was made in a previous,51
NA,debate to the policy of the Government,51
NA,in regard to wool-growers. Members of,51
NA,the Australian Country party have,51
NA,twitted Opposition members by calling,51
NA,them the friends of the wool-growers and,51
NA,by telling them that they do not repre-,51
NA,sent rural constituencies. Many mem-,51
NA,bers of the Labour party are directly,51
NA,"representative of rural industries, and all",51
NA,members of the Labour party are Aus-,51
NA,tralians and regard themselves as repre-,51
NA,sentatives of Australia. We do not,51
NA,believe that any section of the community,51
NA,"should be treated unfairly, regardless of",51
NA,what electorate it lives in. Many wool-,51
NA,growers are probably better off now than,51
NA,they have ever been before. I t is quite,51
NA,true that many of them could bear a,51
NA,greater proportion of the taxation burden,51
NA,than they have borne in the past. But,51
NA,that is not relevant to the proposition,51
NA,before the House. As the honorable,51
NA,member for Perth ( Mr Tom Burke),51
NA,"said, the Government is peeved because",51
NA,the wool-growers had the audacity to,51
NA,"reject the wool stabilization scheme when""",51
NA,"they voted on that matter, so that the",51
NA,Government is obliged to repay to them,51
NA,"£45,000,000. The Government now",51
NA,intends to give that amount back to'the,51
NA,wool-growers with one hand and take,51
NA,"£47,000,000 away with the other. I do",51
NA,not argue that the primary producers,51
NA,generally are not in a very prosperous,51
NA,position. I wish that some so-called,51
NA,representatives of primary interests in -;,51
NA,this House were less eager to extract,51
NA,higher prices from our unfortunate kins-,51
NA,folk overseas and were satisfied with their,51
NA,present returns.,51
NA,The subject of taxation is<associated with- /-,51
NA,the Government's defence programme.,51
NA,There is no member of the Opposition who,51
NA,does not believe in the adequate defence of,51
NA,Australia. But the Government must,51
NA,take into account tne capacity of the coun-,52
NA,try to meet defence expenditure and con-,52
NA,tribute to a joint effort with other coun-,52
NA,tries. Surely honorable members opposite,52
NA,recognize that there must be a limit to,52
NA,what this country can do in the matter of,52
NA,defence.,52
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! I am sorry,52
NA,to say that the honorable gentleman is,52
NA,getting away from taxation.,52
Mr WARD ,Th e Government has,52
NA,asked the Opposition to suggest ways in,52
NA,which increased taxation could be avoided,52
NA,I n order to show how it can be avoided,52
NA,is necessary to deal with the subject of,52
NA,expenditure.,52
NA,"Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! The honor-",52
NA,able gentleman cannot deal with expendi-,52
NA,ture in this debate. This is purely a taxa-,52
NA,tion bill.,52
Mr WARD ,Th e bill relates to taxa-,52
NA,tion for a special purpose. The Govern-,52
NA,ment should review its programme. I t,52
NA,should reduce its expenditure on immigra-,52
NA,tion because of the difficulties,52
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! The honor-,52
NA,able gentleman is getting away from taxa-,52
NA,tion.,52
Mr WARD , I am only making a pass-,52
NA,ing reference.,52
Mr SPEAKER ,Th e honorable,52
NA,gentleman will have an opportunity in,52
NA,Committee of Supply to deal with other,52
NA,"matters. He cannot deal with them now,",52
NA,but must confine himself to taxation.,52
Mr WARD ,I t is not necessary for,52
NA,the Government to impose this burden of,52
NA,taxation on the people. The Govern-,52
NA,ment's proposals will place an inequitable,52
NA,burden on the community and benefit,52
NA,wealthy interests to the disadvantage of,52
NA,the workers. The Government will not,52
NA,encourage greater production by treating,52
NA,"the workers, who are the real producers,",52
NA,"unfairly, but only by treating them more",52
NA,equitably. No worker in receipt of the,52
NA,basic wage or less should have to pay,52
NA,"taxes, because that would leave him",52
NA,with insufficient money on. which to live.,52
NA,I f the Governmeut proposes to increase,52
NA,the rate of taxation with every additional,52
NA,"£50 earned in the lower incomes, why does",52
NA,it not propose to do so regardless of,52
NA,total income? Why should the rate of,52
NA,tax payable by a man in receipt of £8*000,52
NA,a year not be subject to increase until his,52
NA,"salary has increased by £2,000 ?",52
NA,Despite the attempts of the Treasurer,52
NA,to work up some measure of enthusiasm,52
NA,"for the budget, the people are disturbed",52
NA,and alarmed at the Government's propo,52
NA,sals and they are continually heard asking,52
NA,how much longer the Government wil] re-,52
NA,main in office. I suggest that the Govern-,52
NA,ment parties should do what they invited,52
NA,Labour governments to do in the past if,52
NA,they consider that this is a popular budget,52
NA,-tes t the feeling of the people by giving,52
NA,i t . them an opportunity to demonstrate,52
NA,whether they consider that the Govern-,52
NA,ment has acted in a fair and reasonable,52
NA,"manner. As a matter of fact, this Govern-",52
NA,"ment was elected by fraud, because it has",52
NA,reversed every one of its election promises.,52
Mr SPEAKER ,-Order ! The honor-,52
NA,able gentleman is getting away from',52
NA,taxation.,52
Mr WARD ,Th e Government parties,52
NA,"promised to reduce taxation, but",52
Mr TURNBULL , I rise to order! The,52
NA,honorable member for East Sydney ( Mr.,52
NA,Ward) said that this Government wa?,52
NA,elected by fraud. I ask for that state-,52
NA,ment to be withdrawn.,52
Mr SPEAKER , I do not think that,52
NA,""" fraud "" is a parliamentary.word. How-",52
NA,"ever, no member of the Ministry took",52
NA,objection to its use by the honorable mem-,52
NA,ber for East Sydney.,52
Mr ANTHONY ,W e take no notice of,52
NA,what the honorable member for East,52
NA,Sydney says.,52
Mr TURNBULL ,Surel y a private,52
NA,"member has some rights, Mr Speaker?",52
Mr SPEAKER , A private member,52
NA,has rights but the Government was re-,52
NA,"ferred to. However, I think that tbe",52
NA,honorable member for East Sydney,52
NA,should withdraw the expression.,52
Mr WARD ,"I n deference to yon,",52
NA,"Mr Speaker, I withdraw it.",52
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! The honor-,52
NA,able gentleman's time has expired.,52
Mr WENTWORTH ,Mackellar),52
NA,[10.11] -Som e of us wonder whether,52
NA,the honorable member for East Sydnev,52
NA,( Mr Ward),52
NA,Conversation being audible across the,52
NA,"table,",52
Mr SPEAKER ,A s tliere is a for,53
NA,microphone between the two honorable,53
NA,"gentleman at the tabic, I ask them to",53
NA,refrain from continuing their conversacredits,53
NA,tion.,53
NA,Mr YfENTWORTH -Som e of us are,53
NA,often inclined to Wonder whether the,53
NA,honorable member for East Sydney,53
NA,really knows the direction in which,53
NA,argument could lead him. He devoted,53
NA,more than half of his speech to a,53
NA,frustrated and bitter plea for higher,53
NA,taxation on companies. I wonder whether sional,53
NA,he realized the implication of that,53
NA,proposal. When company taxation,53
NA,"is increased, a wealthy shareholder's",53
NA,own taxes are decreased by almost,53
NA,an equivalent percentage.,53
NA,fore an increase of company taxation,53
NA,means very little to a wealthy shareand,53
NA,"holder. On the other hand, an increase is",53
NA,of company taxation means a great deal,53
NA,"to a small shareholder, because dividends",53
NA,in his hands are not subject to so,53
NA,a rate as when they are in the hands,53
NA,n wealthy ?hareholder. Therefore the,53
NA,proposal' of the honorable member for,53
NA,East Sydney would mean little to the,53
NA,wealthy shareholders that the honorable,53
NA,"member professes to hate, and cuts at",53
NA,3mall shareholders almost exclusively. I,53
NA,is characteristic of the honorable member,53
NA,"for East Sydney, that, in his zeal, or",53
NA,"whatever it may be, he hurts those for of the loan market.",53
NA,"whom he professes concern, and who",53
NA,might in return try to be friendly with,53
NA,him. The House should not be bothered,53
NA,about the crocodile tears that were shed,53
NA,by the honorable member for East Sydney,53
NA,on behalf of the wool-growers.,53
NA,I shall now turn to the bill that,53
NA,"before the House, and shall ignore the",53
NA,irrelevancies that were introduced by,53
NA,honorable member for East Sydney. This,53
NA,measure relates to the general budget that,53
NA,has been discussed by the House. The,53
NA,general level of taxation that it seeks,53
NA,impose relates to the budgetary proposals,53
NA,that have been already dealt with.,53
NA,taxation structure must be judged in,53
NA,light of both temporary and long-term,53
NA,factors. [Quorum formed.'] The present,53
NA,taxation level must be judged in relation,53
NA,to the temporary situation covered by,53
NA,budget and the general economic strucproposals,53
NA,ture: of the country. The budget provides,53
NA,"a levy of £427,000,000 on individual",53
NA,"incomes and £135,000,000 on companies-",53
NA,"a total of £562,000,000. I n addition, wool",53
NA,"aggregating about £100,000,000",53
NA,are carried into this taxation year. There-,53
NA,fore the total levy during this financial,53
NA,"year will be about £660,000,000. That",53
NA,tremendous' levy is necessary in view of,53
NA,the economic position that has been,53
NA,his revealed during the budget debate.,53
NA,I t is perhaps justifiable to recall the,53
NA,facts concerning the imposition of provi-,53
NA,"taxation, which drastically",53
NA,increased the immediate tax yield.,53
NA,The tax paid by a person who,53
NA,"conducts a business, a rural pro-",53
NA,"ducer, or one who derives income from",53
NA,"Thereproperty, can be calculated approxi^",53
NA,mately by doubling his current assessment,53
NA,subtracting his assessment for the last,53
NA,financial year. I know that that formula,53
NA,"not strictly applied, but in general it is",53
NA,applied. Its effect is to make very evident,53
NA,. swings in the yield from taxation as,53
NA,high incomes vary. There is a very pro-,53
NA,"of nounced variation when, as was the case",53
NA,"with wool, incomes were so unexpectedly",53
NA,high last year. I t is not unreasonable,53
NA,that the Government should look to the,53
NA,"high taxation yield, due partly to high",53
NA,the incomes and partly to the incidence of,53
NA,"t provisional taxation, as a means to enable",53
NA,a surplus to be paid into the National,53
NA,"Debt Sinking Fund, in view of the state-",53
NA,I t is frequently claimed that high,53
NA,direct taxation acts as a deterrent to,53
NA,incentive and results in reduced output.,53
NA,"To a degree, that is true. I t is particu-",53
NA,larly true when a man has little left of,53
NA,the income that he has earned. Both Mr.,53
NA,is Colin Clark and Professor Hicks have,53
NA,agreed that bad effects on incentive are,53
NA,the inevitable when there is left to a tax-,53
NA,"payer less than one-third of his income,",53
NA,"that is, less than 6s. 8d. in each £1 of",53
NA,his additional earnings. I t is interesting,53
NA,to t'o recall that at the top rate of tax on,53
NA,income a taxpayer will be left with only*,53
NA,A 3s. 6d. in the £1 at the rates' pro-,53
NA,the posed in this budget or about half,53
NA,of the minimum' safe limit. Thc tax rata,53
NA,of 10s. for each additional £1 of income,53
NA,earned is reached at about the income of,53
NA,"the £2,500 a year. Therefore, the budget",53
NA,will act as a definite deterrent,53
NA,to incentive for those who earn the higher,53
NA,incomes. That of course is not true of,54
NA,the lower income earners. Consider a,54
NA,"man who earns £900 a year, which is a",54
NA,medium low income. I f such a man,54
NA,should earn an additional £1 he,54
NA,"would retain los. 3d. of it, the Treasury",54
NA,taking 4s. 9d. Therefore it will be readily,54
NA,seen that such a man will s€ill have an,54
NA,incentive to earn more money. That,54
NA,disposes of the contention put forward in,54
NA,some quarters that people will not work,54
NA,"overtime, because their additional income",54
NA,will be taken from them through taxation.,54
NA,A man who earned £900 a year would have,54
NA,15s. 3d. left to him of each additional,54
NA,£1 earned whereas a man who earned what,54
NA,may be described as one of the top incomes,54
NA,would have only 3s. 6d. left after paying,54
NA,his income tax. The importance to the,54
NA,whole economy of not destroying the in-,54
NA,centive to earn of those on higher incomes,54
NA,is clearly set out by Mr Colin Clark in,54
NA,his lecture on the Principles of Public,54
NA,Finance and Taxation which was delivered,54
NA,"on the 14th August, 1950. He said inter",54
NA,alia-,54
NA,"When euch marginal rates are high, as thoy",54
NA,"are in many tax systems, the company execu-",54
NA,tive soon comes to realize . . . that of each,54
NA,additional pound which he spends on the com-,54
NA,"pany's account, half or more may be borne",54
NA,by the Treasury. I t is remarkable how soon,54
NA,this begins to have an effect on expense,54
NA,"accounts, advertising appropriations, staff",54
NA,"bonuses and pensions, and many other cate-",54
NA,gories of expenditure. But most important,54
NA,of all is its effect in wage negotiations. The,54
NA,employer no longer performs his natural eco-,54
NA,nomic function of resisting demands for wage,54
NA,increases. As a result the inflationary spiral,54
NA,"keeps on turning, with higher wages leading",54
NA,"to higher prices, and higher prices in turn",54
NA,leading to a demand for a further wage,54
NA,increase.,54
NA,.We are now in the economic condition,54
NA,which was described by Mr Colin Clark.,54
NA,That is to some extent attributable to the,54
NA,destruction of the incentive of the higher,54
NA,income earners by the almost confiscatory,54
NA,taxes.. The harmful effect of these taxes,54
NA,is particularly shown by companies. In,54
NA,these concerns not only is there a tax on,54
NA,"the earnings of the company, but there is",54
NA,also a tax on those earnings when they,54
NA,are paid as dividends to shareholders. It,54
NA,is probable that out of every £1 that a,54
NA,"company earns, only 4s. or 5s. goes to the",54
NA,"owners of the company, the remainder",54
NA,finding its way to the Treasury and becom-,54
NA,ing one of the main supports of the Go-,54
NA,Mr Wentworth.,54
NA,vernment's expenditure on social services,54
NA,and other commitments.,54
NA,"These are facts, supported by figures,",54
NA,and are probably inconvenient from the,54
NA,point of view of the Opposition because,54
NA,they destroy the main thesis of the honor-,54
NA,able member for East Sydney. One can,54
NA,say that the present scale of taxation is,54
NA,"justified as a temporary expedient, in",54
NA,"view of our commitments, but it would",54
NA,not be justified as a long-term system,54
NA,because it would inevitably lead to a,54
NA,further turning of the inflationary spiral,54
NA,in the way that Colin Clark has so ably,54
NA,described. I n considering future taxa-,54
NA,tion policy one is led to think that per-,54
NA,haps some fundamental changes in taxa-,54
NA,tion outlook are now overdue. Those of,54
NA,us who can perceive gathering tensions in,54
NA,"the economy, who are a little disturbed at",54
NA,the progress of events and who think that,54
NA,unless remedial action is soon taken we,54
NA,"may be in for a hard economic time,",54
NA,wonder whether a change of taxation,54
NA,policy may not be one of the measures,54
NA,which will lead to the overcoming of in-,54
NA,flation and the improvement of our,54
NA,economic health. I am not criticizing,54
NA,"the present proposals, which I believe to",54
NA,be fully justified in the present emer-,54
NA,"gency. I do say, however, that consider-",54
NA,"ing the long-term effects of the proposals,",54
NA,we should envisage another kind of,54
NA,policy.,54
NA,I agree that taxation policy is only one,54
NA,"part of the main financial policy, but i l",54
NA,is an important part and one which should,54
NA,not be neglected. I suggest that some,54
NA,"part, perhaps 10 per cent, or 15 per cent,",54
NA,"of every tax payment, could be regarded as",54
NA,a loan repayable at a fnture date. Such au,54
NA,"action would restore incentive, especially",54
NA,in view of the fact that a large part of,54
NA,the revenue mentioned in the budget is,54
NA,to be transferred to a sinking fund. Of,54
NA,"course, so far as this budget is concerned,",54
NA,it may be argued against my proposal,54
NA,that in view of the likely sharp fall in,54
NA,tax yield as wool incomes are reduced,54
NA,and the effects of provisional taxation,54
NA,"amplify the fall, it may be necessary to",54
NA,"make financial provision for next year,",54
NA,and therefore it would be inadvisable to,54
NA,treat a part of this year's taxes as a loan.,54
NA,"Nevertheless, as a matter of permanent",54
NA,policy my suggestion might be considered,54
NA,as one of the means of financing the,54
NA,defence expenditure which every honor-,55
NA,able meniber in this chamber knows is,55
NA,necessary in the years immediately ahead,55
NA,but trusts will be only temporary and will,55
NA,be relaxed when the present world tension,55
NA,passes.,55
NA,Property income carries a special,55
NA,impost from £100 a year upwards. That is,55
NA,uot right. I n the lower groups of property,55
NA,income owners have suffered particularJy,55
NA,"because of innation, and I suggest",55
NA,that the first £500 or £600 of pro-,55
NA,perty income should be treated on,55
NA,the same basis as income from per-,55
NA,sonal exertion. That suggestion is,55
NA,directed to helping the small property,55
NA,income owner and is of no significance to,55
NA,persons with large property income. There,55
NA,is a group of small property owners who,55
NA,"should be helped, who deserve to be",55
NA,"helped, and who can be helped at small",55
NA,expense to the Treasury.,55
NA,My third point concerns allowances,55
NA,for depreciation. They become more im-,55
NA,portant because of the general rise of ail,55
NA,"prices, including those of machinery",55
NA,used in factories. Let us suppose that a,55
NA,"company bought a machine for £1,000.",55
NA,When the machine has.worn out and after,55
NA,"its value has been completely written off,",55
NA,"the company would have £1,000 in its",55
NA,"depreciation reserve. However, when the",55
NA,"time came to replace the machine, the",55
NA,company would be obliged to pay the new,55
NA,"price, which would probably be £2,000 or",55
NA,"£3,000, and it would not have in reserve",55
NA,sufficient to meet that contingency. Capi-,55
NA,tal is being eroded in that way. Accord-,55
NA,ing to figures produced in this House by,55
NA,"the Treasurer, in his statement on national",55
NA,"income, the amount allowed for deprecia-",55
NA,"tion last year was £225,000,000. I f that",55
NA,"figure is correct, it indicates a very",55
NA,"degree of capital erosion, this tendency",55
NA,is very serious and further pro-,55
NA,vision will have to be made in that,55
NA,respect i f industry is to continue produc-,55
NA,ing to its full capacity. Whilst I believe,55
NA,that the Treasurer is correct in suspend-,55
NA,"ing, or abolishing, the special deprecia-",55
NA,"tion allowance of 40 per cent., at the",55
NA,"same time, it might have been possible",55
NA,selectivity to continue that allowance,55
NA,in relation to industries that we par-,55
NA,ticularly desire to expand. I refer to,55
NA,industries in which bottlenecks are hold-,55
NA,ing up production. Every one should,55
NA,realize that the standard of living in this,55
NA,country is kept low as a result of those,55
NA,bottlenecks; and all who are concerned,55
NA,about maintaining living standards in,55
NA,this country should recognize that such,55
NA,"action, whatever its cost might be to the",55
NA,"Treasury, would return much more to the",55
NA,taxpayer and the community generally.,55
NA,The Treasurer has acted rightly in,55
NA,modifying the averaging provision in,55
NA,relation to primary producers. Such,55
NA,action had to be taken during the current,55
NA,financial year or it could not have been,55
NA,"taken at all, because those who had",55
NA,enjoyed the benefits of the system on the,55
NA,rise would have been relieved of the,55
NA,correspondingly increased payments on,55
NA,the fall. I n view of the very steep rise,55
NA,in the incomes of primary producers,55
NA,during last financial year this change had,55
NA,to be made this year or i t could never,55
NA,"have been made. However, I agree with",55
NA,some honorable members that instead of,55
NA,"abolishing the averaging system, we could,",55
NA,"perhaps, modify i t substantially. I am",55
NA,wondering whether it might not be pos-,55
NA,sible for all persons to do their own,55
NA,averaging within certain prescribed limits,55
NA,by electing to deposit a proportion of their,55
NA,income with the Treasury. Such deposit,55
NA,"would be a deduction from taxable income,",55
NA,but would be an accretion to taxable,55
NA,income in the year of its withdrawal.,55
NA,Such a proposal involves certain technical,55
NA,"difficulties, which I have not time to",55
NA,"discuss at this juncture, but it would have",55
NA,some substantial resemblance in certain,55
NA,respects to the system that is now in,55
NA,operation in the United States of America.,55
NA,I t would help not only primary pro-,55
NA,ducers but also other persons whose,55
NA,"incomes fluctuate considerably, such as",55
NA,serious authors or business men who expend,55
NA,"efforts for two or three years, but receive",55
NA,their reward in one year. The' entre-,55
NA,"preneur is an important, factor in the",55
NA,"economy, but under the existing system",55
NA,he suffers hardship when working at a,55
NA,loss whilst the Treasury takes the bulk of,55
NA,any profit that he may eventually make.,55
NA,I f a system of voluntary averaging were,55
NA,applied to not only primary producers,55
NA,"but also taxpayers generally, the whole of",55
NA,the taxation scale would have a much,55
NA,fairer incidence.,55
NA,The final point that I wish to make is,55
NA,the most important of those that I have,55
NA,raised. I t is that the most inflationary,56
NA,"force in the community to-day, not",56
NA,excepting the. rise in overseas priees and,56
NA,"wool incomes, is the body of wives and",56
NA,children for -whom allowance is made in,56
NA,the computation of tbe basic wage but,56
NA,who do not actually exist. _ The basic,56
NA,"wage, whatever the legal technicalities may",56
NA,"be, is in fact determined on the needs of",56
NA,"a man, his wife and two children.",56
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! The honor-,56
NA,able member is getting away from taxa-,56
NA,tion.,56
Mr WENTWORTH , I am showing,56
NA,that the basic wage is insufficient for a,56
NA,"man and his family whilst, at the same",56
NA,"time, it is too high for the needs of the",56
NA,single man. I t thus makes it possible,56
NA,to bring single recipients into the taxation,56
NA,field on higher scales. We must consider,56
NA,regrading the whole taxation scale in,56
NA,"order, perhaps, to bring it nearer to the",56
NA,"British, or New Zealand, model. I n Great",56
NA,Britain and New Zealand the rate of,56
NA,income tax on the lower grades of income,56
NA,"is much heavier than i t is in Australia,",56
NA,but the allowances in respect of families,56
NA,are much greater. Under a similar sys-,56
NA,tem of taxation it would be possible to,56
NA,"give more to a man with a family, who",56
NA,"really needs more, without inflicting",56
NA,hardship on a taxpayer who has no,56
NA,family. By regrading the taxation scale,56
NA,the Government would remove the most,56
NA,powerful inflationary force in the com-,56
NA,munity to wliich I have referred. The,56
NA,"last census, which was taken in 1947,",56
NA,revealed that out of approximately,56
NA,"3,000,000 persons who are gainfully",56
NA,employed in this country no less than,56
NA,"1,300,000 had not married. There is the",56
NA,"real inflationary force in the community,",56
NA,because not only do single persons spend,56
NA,money-an d their expenditure on their,56
NA,own consumption is in the most infla-,56
NA,tionary category-bu t their expenditure,56
NA,involves capital equipment provided by,56
NA,other investors to satisfy their needs. We,56
NA,should attack this major problem. We,56
NA,should help to restore health and justice,56
NA,to the community as a whole by.giving,56
NA,"more to the married man and, perhaps,",56
NA,leaving less for those who are not so,56
NA,much in need of additional income. I,56
NA,"suggest, for example, that the present",56
NA,deduction of £104 from the taxable,56
NA,income that is allowed in respect of a.,56
NA,wife might be increased to £250 in the,56
NA,case of a wife who is an invalid or who,56
NA,"cannot work, and that the deduction in",56
NA,"respect of the first child, which is now £78,",56
NA,"might be increased to about £250, and",56
NA,that the deduction of £52 at present,56
NA,allowed in respect of other children,56
NA,might be increased to at least £100. The,56
NA,deduction which I am glad to note the.,56
NA,Government proposes to make in respect,56
NA,of aged people should also be increased.,56
NA,"Generally speaking, single persons wish",56
NA,to have tlie opportunity to save in pre-,56
NA,"paration for marriage. Therefore, under",56
NA,"the regrading, I suggest that they should",56
NA,"be allowed to save a certain sum, say",56
NA,£400 or £500 free of income tax for that,56
NA,purpose. That sum could be deposited,56
NA,at the Treasury to be released to the,56
NA,persons concerned on the day on which,56
NA,they marry. A re-fashioning of the,56
NA,taxation scale in. the way that I have,56
NA,suggested is of major importance and is,56
NA,"overdue, because unless we take action of",56
NA,that kind we shall not succeed in check-,56
NA,ing inflation. I t will be of advantage,56
NA,"to everybody, whether single or married,",56
NA,because it will tend .to curb existing,56
NA,inflationary forces .and prevent the basic,56
NA,wage from rising still higher. Most,56
NA,single persons would agree with the,56
NA,"fundamental justice of this proposal,",56
NA,"because they have the family outlook,",56
NA,and i f they live for long enough they,56
NA,themselves will graduate into the married,56
NA,class. I n the interests of the whole com-,56
NA,munity it should be possible for us to look,56
NA,forward to a re-fashioning of the taxa-,56
NA,"tion scale, perhaps not exactly in the",56
NA,"manner that I have suggested, but in",56
NA,"some other way, in order to place a",56
NA,heavier burden of taxation on the single,56
NA,man without dependants. That practice,56
NA,is followed in Great Britain and in other,56
NA,countries. Greater taxation relief should,56
NA,be afforded married men with dependants.,56
NA,They should be helped by the removal,56
NA,from the market of the competition tbe,56
NA,""" hot"" money of single men provides,",56
NA,thus allowing them to live at a reason-,56
NA,able standard and within' their income.,56
NA,Whilst a decision on such a matter can-,56
NA,"not be made straight away, I suggest to",56
NA,the House that it is at least worth think-,56
NA,ing about.,56
NA,Bebate (on motion by Mr OBBA.N),56

NA,Motion (by Mr ERIC J. HARRISON),57

Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,Hindmarsh),57
NA,[10.41] - I wish to direct attention to,57
NA,a matter that vitally affects the immigra-,57
NA,tion policy of this country. I believe,57
NA,that we should do everything possible in,57
NA,order to encourage British people to,57
NA,emigrate to Australia in as large numbers,57
NA,as possible. The treatment of British,57
NA,immigrants on their arrival here is such,57
NA,that it is amazing that Britishers-,57
NA,continue to come here. I refer to,57
NA,the policy of the Government in rela-,57
NA,tion to the charges that are made for,57
NA,hostel accommodation in Adelaide. 1,57
NA,presume that the same charges operate in,57
NA,other parts of the Commonwealth.,57
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! I point out,57
NA,that the honorable gentleman is raising,57
NA,a matter which may be dealt with during,57
NA,the debate on the Estimates which are,57
NA,before the Committee of Supply. He is,57
NA,fully entitled to debate this matter on,57
NA,another occasion.,57
Mr CLYDE CAMERON , I shall,57
NA,not continue to discuss the charges that,57
NA,"are made. However, I wish to raise an",57
NA,important and urgent matter concerning,57
NA,the food which immigrants are expected,57
NA,to eat. I suggest that I cannot very well,57
NA,refer to that subject during the debate on,57
NA,the Estimates. I have in my hand the,57
NA,breakfast that was served to a British,57
NA,immigrant in Adelaide last Friday. I .,57
NA,have here a piece of what appears to be,57
NA,"bacon, which was served raw. I have",57
NA,also a concoction that looks something,57
NA,"like a green plum, with batter round it.",57
NA,That was all that was served to the person,57
NA,concerned at the immigrant hostel at,57
NA,Rosewater. I consider that the Minister,57
NA,for Immigration ( Mr Holt) should,57
NA,sample this breakfast to-morrow morn-,57
NA,"ing. Having done so, he should then",57
NA,"inform, the House whether he thinks",57
NA,that the food that is being provided for,57
NA,British immigrants in Adelaide is worth,57
NA,"£11 8s. a week, which is the amount that",57
NA,the Government charges the immigrant,57
NA,family that I bave in mind. The husband,57
NA,is obliged to pay £3 10s. a week. The,57
NA,"wife, who is working, pays an additional",57
NA,£3 2s. a. week. For two children over,57
NA,"ten years of age, £1 l i s . 6d. a week each is",57
NA,"paid; and, in addition, £1 5s. a week is",57
NA,paid for a child four years of age. The,57
NA,husband is also obliged to pay 8s. a week,57
NA,to the nursery for the care of the child of,57
NA,four years for 38 hours a week. For,57
NA,any period in excess of 38 hours he must,57
NA,"pay an additional 2s., making a total of",57
NA,"£11 8s. a week, or £11 10s. a week i f the",57
NA,mother is not able to return in sufficient,57
NA,time to relieve the nursery of the care,57
NA,of the child after 38 hours.,57
NA,"Government supporters interjecting,",57
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! I f honor-,57
NA,"able members do not keep quiet, I shall",57
NA,leave the chair.,57
Mr CLYDE CAMERON , This,57
NA,matter cannot be taken lightly. I t is very,57
NA,well for honorable members opposite to,57
NA,"sit there grinning and laughing, but i f",57
NA,they are serious about the question of,57
NA,"immigration, I suggest that some of the",57
NA,flowery pledges and promises that are,57
NA,made to people in England should be,57
NA,honoured.,57
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! The honoi-,57
NA,able gentleman is commencing to deal with,57
NA,matters that he may discuss when the,57
NA,estimates of the Department of Immigra-,57
NA,tion are being debated.,57
Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,Wit h your,57
NA,"permission, Mr Speaker, I should like, i f",57

NA,House,57
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! The honor-,57
NA,able gentleman will do nothing of the,57
NA,kind.,57
Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,Then 1,57
NA,should like these samples to be incorpor-,57
NA,ated in Hansard.,57
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! I f the,57
NA,honorable gentleman thinks thathe is,57
NA,going to produce exhibits in this chamber,57
NA,"and make jokes about them in that way,",57
NA,he will not be permitted to. proceed. I f he,57
NA,has information of the kind that he claims,57
NA,"to have, he should move a. substantive",57
NA,motion.,57
Mr CLYDE CAMERON , I conclude,57
NA,with a plea to the Minister to look into,57

Mr WARD ,East Sydney) [10.46] - I,58
NA,bring to the notice of the House a most,58
NA,urgent and important matter. Recently,58
NA,"in this chamber the dismissal of 10,000",58
NA,"public servants, under the plan of the",58
NA,"Government, was discussed. On that occa-",58
NA,sion the Prime Minister ( Mr Menzies),58
NA,indicated that a certain order of priority,58
NA,of dismissal had been decided upon by the,58
NA,Public Service Board. Honorable mem-,58
NA,bers were assured that that order of,58
NA,priority was being observed in the dis-,58
NA,missals that were being carried out in the,58
NA,"various government departments, although",58
NA,there was some doubt whether it was being,58
NA,followed in the Department of Labour and,58
NA,"National Service. Recently, I referred",58
NA,a case to the Minister for Repatria-,58
NA,tion (Senator Cooper). The man to whom,58
NA,"I refer is 57 years of age, a returned",58
NA,soldier of World War I . and World War,58
NA,"IL , and in receipt of a 100 per cent, dis-",58
NA,ability war pension. He had been work-,58
NA,ing for the Repatriation Department for,58
NA,approximately five years. He received a,58
NA,dismissal notice. I took the matter up,58
NA,"with the Minister for Repatriation, and",58
NA,received the following reply:-,58
NA,I n carrying out the decision of the Govern-,58
NA,ment in regard to reduction in the Public,58
NA,Service niy department acted in accordance,58
NA,with instructions issued by the Public Service,58
NA,Board aud iu selecting those employees to be,58
NA,"retrenched the practice followed was to retain,",58
NA,"within any group or class of employment, the",58
NA,efiicient employee in preference to the one who,58
NA,was less efficient or unsuitable for auy particu-,58
NA,lar type of work.,58
NA,That reply is in direct conflict with,58
NA,what the Prime Minister said would be,58
NA,the order of priority. I understood the,58
NA,right honorable gentleman to say-an d I,58
NA,think my understanding is similar to that,58
NA,of other honorable members-tha t the,58
NA,last persons to be displaced would be dis-,58
NA,abled ex-servicemen. Yet here is a,58
NA,man being retrenched who has served,58
NA,"in two world wars, who is in",58
NA,"receipt of a 100 per cent, disability",58
NA,pension and who was obliged to spend,58
NA,six months this year in the Prince oi,58
NA,Wales Repatriation Hospital at Rand-,58
NA,wick. He received his dismissal notice,58
NA,after he had been discharged from that,58
NA,"hospital, the reason for his dismissal",58
NA,being that i t was thought that other,58
NA,employees were more efficient than he,58
NA,was. Although his inefficiency is due to,58
NA,"his war-caused disabilities, he is",58
NA,> r being penalized because of those dis-,58
NA,1,58
NA,"abilities. I n the light of those facts,",58
NA,it is reasonable to ask: What of the,58
NA,Government's talk about preference to,58
NA,returned soldiers and of the system under,58
NA,which such dismissals are to be effected?,58
NA,"I t is difficult to find out the exact position,",58
NA,if we cannot believe the statements of,58
NA,"the Prime Minister, which are not in",58
NA,accordance with those of two of his,58
NA,Ministers. I consider that there is an,58
NA,' obligation on the Government to inform,58
NA,honorable members of the facts regarding,58
NA,the dismissals that have been taking place,58
NA,in the various departments. This is the,58
NA,"third disabled ex-serviceman, formerly",58
NA,employed by the Repatriation Depart-,58
NA,"ment, whose plight has been brought to",58
NA,"my notice. I n turn, I have brought the",58
NA,particulars of each of them to the notice,58
NA,of the Government. I ask the Vice-.,58
NA,President of the Executive Council ( Mr.,58
NA,"Eric J. Harrison), i f he is unaware of the",58
NA,"exact position, to ascertain the facts so",58
NA,that we may be informed at the earliest,58
NA,possible moment of the action that the,58
NA,Government proposes to take regarding,58
NA,"those disabled ex-servicemen, who, under",58
NA,"the retrenchment programme, have been",58
NA,dismissed. I should like to know whether,58
NA,the gentleman to whom I refer is to be,58
NA,regarded as ineligible for employment in,58
NA,any branch of the government service.,58
NA,Does the Government propose to provide,58
NA,"him with alternative employment, and",58
NA,compensate him for loss of time during,58
NA,the period which may elapse before he,58
NA,is found another position? The man to,58
NA,whom I refer is urgently in need of work.,58
NA,"The 100 per cent, disability pension",58
NA,which lie receives is insufficient to main-,58
NA,"tain him, and he must supplement it by",58
NA,accepting a job. The Minister for,58
NA,Repatriation (Senator Cooper) has been,58
NA,"informed of his name, but i f the Vice-",58
NA,President of the Executive Council also,58
NA,"requires it, I am prepared to supply it",58
NA,to him. I ask for an explanation of the,58
NA,exact position regarding those dismissals.,58

NA,ceeding for the electrification of the railway,62
NA,line at Lithgow.,62
NA,2. A power station is being built at,62
NA,Wallerawang for the Electricity Commission,62
NA,of New South Wales. This power station was,62
NA,considered to be necessary in order to meet,62
NA,the demand for electrification of the railway,62
NA,line to Lithgow and the expanding electricity,62
NA,requirements of the western district.,62

Mr ANTHONY , O n the 27th Septem-,62
NA,"ber, the bonorable member f o r M a c k e l l a r",62
NA,( Mr W e n t w o r t h ) asked,62
NA,questions:-,62
NA,. 1. Is the Minister representing the Minister,62
NA,for Shipping and Transport aware that the,62
NA,Clyde Etigneering Company Liniited is in pro-,62
NA,cess of delivering eleven diesel electric locomo-,62
NA,tives to the Commonwealth Railways for use,62

NA,that the deliveries have already started and,62
NA,that they are scheduled to complete next,62
NA,April .,62
NA,2. Is the Minister aware that these locomo-,62
NA,tives are eminently suitable for coal haulage,62
NA,in New South Wales Railways nnd in fact were,62
NA,tested by hauling coal over New South Wales,62
NA,lines?,62
NA,3. Is i t also a fact that owing to lack of,62
NA,"foresight by the MCGirr Govenment, the New",62
NA,South Wales Railways are short of suitable-,62
NA,locomotives for coal haulage and cannot trans-,62
NA,port all the coal that requires transport?,62
NA,4. Since coal haulage is of top priority,62
NA,w i l l the Minister consider* diverting some of,62
NA,these locomotives for use on coal haulage in-,62
NA,New South Wales until the MCGirr-Govern-,62
NA,ment is able to remedy the deficiencies caused,62
NA,by its former lack of 'foresight?,62

NA,3. I t is understood that the New South.,62
NA,"Wales Railways, in common with most railway",62

NA,diesel electric and steam locomotives undei,62
NA,construction overseas.,62
NA,4. The eleven diesel electric locomotive-,62
NA,under construction by Clyde Engineering Com-,62

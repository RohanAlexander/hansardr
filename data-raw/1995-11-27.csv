NA,DELEGA TION REPORTS,11
NA,Delegation to Slovenia and the 94th,11
NA,Inter-Parliamentary Conference held in,11
NA,Bucharest,11
Mr SPEAKER,I present the report of,11
NA,Australian Parliamentary Delegation to,11
NA,Slovenia and the 94th Inter-Parliamentary,11
NA,"Conference held in Bucharest, October 1995.",11
NA,The Slovenian section of the program was,11
NA,lead by my friend and colleague the honourinto,11
NA,able member for Watson ( Mr Leo MCLeay).,11
NA,I will therefore let him make any comment,11
NA,that section he would like to.,11
NA,The 94th Inter-Parliamentary Conference,11
NA,was held in Bucharest between 9 and 13,11
NA,October. It was an extremely well-organised,11
NA,conference set in the stunningly opulent,11
NA,"Palace of Parliament, the former Ceaucescu",11
NA,Palace. The location of the conference in,11
NA,palace underscored the contrast which is still,11
NA,obvious in Bucharest as Romania makes a,11
NA,transition to a modem and democratic society.,11
NA,"Clearly, much has been achieved since 1989,",11
NA,but there are still many challenges ahead.,11
NA,I was pleased while in Romania to be able,11
NA,to meet with both the Presiding Officers,11
NA,the Romanian parliament and with the Prime,11
NA,Minister. Each commented on the warmth,11
NA,the existing relationship between Australia,11
NA,and Romania and the potential for further,11
NA,"development, especially in trade. In particular,",11
NA,they noted that the Romanian government had,11
NA,recently approved the privatisation of around,11
NA,"4,000 of Romania's leading state companies,",11
NA,a move which in their view will provide,11
NA,significant opportunities for further Australian,11
NA,investment and joint ventures.,11
NA,The conference agenda itself is covered,11
NA,detail in the report. I just comment that,11
NA,supplementary item dealt with nuclear testing,11
NA,issues. We were pleased as a delegation,11
NA,lend our support to New Zealand and Chile in House.,11
NA,putting that particular item forward for con-,11
NA,sideration as a supplementary item.,11
NA,"During the conference, the honourable",11
NA,member for Watson was appointed to the,11
NA,drafting committee charged with the difficult,11
NA,very lengthy task of drafting a resolution,11
NA,on the supplementary topic of nuclear testing.,11
NA,I think it is a great tribute to his ability that,11
NA,the particular draft resolution that came,11
NA,forward was in fact carried by the conference.,11
NA,The honourable member for Melbourne,11
NA,Ports ( Mr Holding) attended the conference as,11
NA,a substitute member on the Committee for,11
NA,the Human Rights of Parliamentarians. I am,11
NA,pleased to report to the parliament that in,11
NA,Bucharest he was elected to fill the Asia-,11
NA,Pacific vacancy on that committee and will,11
NA,thus continue the excellent work he has put,11
NA,this committee over several years.,11
NA,Our delegation attended many meetings,11
NA,on during the conference. They included the,11
NA,"Asia-Pacific and 12+ groups, the Inter-Parlia-",11
NA,"mentary Council, the Committee to Monitor",11
NA,the Situation in Cyprus and the Meeting of,11
NA,Women Parliamentarians. Details of all those,11
NA,deliberations can be found in our report.,11
NA,I would like to thank the members of the,11
NA,"the delegation: the Deputy Leader, Senator",11
NA,"Calvert, Senators Denman and Woods and the",11
NA,honourable members for Melbourne Ports and,11
NA,Watson for their commitment to the delegat-,11
NA,ion's program. I also thank the delegation,11
NA,"secretary, Peter Keele, whose assistance and",11
NA,genial company were greatly appreciated by,11
NA,of us all. I also extend thanks to my personal,11
NA,"adviser, Geraldine Skinner, for her continuing",11
NA,of dedication to the work of the IPU.,11
NA,I also record our appreciation of the assist-,11
NA,ance provided by Ambassadors Walker and,11
NA,"Campbell, the Australian embassy staff in",11
NA,"Slovenia and Romania, particularly Margaret",11
NA,Newman and Pam MCDonald of the Depart-,11
NA,"ment of Foreign Affairs and Trade, who",11
NA,accompanied us to the conference. I also,11
NA,"thank the Parliamentary Library, the Canberra",11
NA,based staff of the Department of Foreign,11
NA,in Affairs and Trade and staff of the Department,11
NA,the of Housing and Regional Development for the,11
NA,invaluable briefings they provided to the,11
NA,to delegation. I commend the report to the,11
NA,Mr LEO MCLEA Y (Watson) (12.35,11
NA,p.m.)-I would like to make a few remarks,11
NA,regarding the VISIt of the delegation to,12
NA,"Slovenia. As members might be aware,",12
NA,Slovenia is one of the newer countries of the,12
NA,"world, only becoming independent from the",12
NA,fonner Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991. Australia,12
NA,was one of the first countries in the world to,12
NA,"recognise Slovenia as an independent state,",12
NA,doing so on 16 January 1992. That was,12
NA,something for which the Slovenes have,12
NA,always held Australia especially in their,12
NA,"hearts, and the wannth of the people upon the",12
NA,visit of the Australian delegation was very,12
NA,pleasing to us all.,12
NA,"It is estimated that there are about 30,000",12
NA,"fonner Slovenes living in Australia at present,",12
NA,which shows that the ties between the two,12
NA,countries are more than just the economic ties,12
NA,that countries are generally interested in.,12
NA,"Slovenia is a very small country, about one-",12
NA,"third the size of Tasmania, with a population",12
NA,"of about two million people. For Australia, it",12
NA,is situated at a very useful place in Europe in,12
NA,"that the port of Koper, which is on the",12
NA,"Adriatic, would obviously be of use for",12
NA,people who wish to export directly into,12
NA,central and eastern Europe from the Asia-,12
NA,Pacific region. As Slovenia arranges its,12
NA,transportation links to become a crossroad of,12
NA,"Europe, that port facility I think will become",12
NA,much more interesting for Australian export-,12
NA,ers who could take a couple of days off their,12
NA,transportation time by using that port rather,12
NA,than the western European ports that they now,12
NA,use.,12
NA,The Slovenian government is moving down,12
NA,the track towards privatisation and towards,12
NA,integrating their economy with western,12
NA,Europe. They are on the way to becoming,12
NA,"members of the European Union. In Slovenia,",12
NA,one gets the impression of a small country,12
NA,which has come to grips with independence,12
NA,from the old Yugoslavia and which has set,12
NA,itself on the road to progress. After visiting,12
NA,"the country, one is certain that they will",12
NA,"achieve the goal they have set themselves,",12
NA,that of becoming a modern European state in,12
NA,the middle of the new Europe.,12
NA,The delegation was very well looked after,12
NA,"by the Slovene parliament, and we had some",12
NA,very good meetings with both officials and,12
NA,ministers of the country. I was particularly,12
NA,pleased to again make the acquaintance of my,12
NA,"friend Zoran Thaler, the foreign minister of",12
NA,"Slovenia, who assured the delegation that",12
NA,Slovenia would be supporting Australia's,12
NA,candidature for the UN Security Council. So,12
NA,the bonds between our two countries-and,12
NA,they are bonds which go both ways-are very,12
NA,good.,12
NA,I think there are increasing opportunities for,12
NA,"trade between Australia and Slovenia, and",12
NA,there are even greater opportunities for trade,12
NA,that transits Slovenia destined for other parts,12
NA,of eastern and central Europe. Now that the,12
NA,"conflict in Bosnia looks like being resolved,",12
NA,I think that port of Koper will become even,12
NA,more important.,12
NA,"I might just mention in passing, Mr Deputy",12
NA,"Speaker, that the Speaker remarked upon the",12
NA,IPU conference and our participation there. I,12
NA,found the drafting committee which came up,12
NA,with the resolution on nuclear testing to be a,12
NA,"very interesting contest which, in the end, got",12
NA,down to a contest between Australia and,12
NA,France. The French were very well represent-,12
NA,"ed by M. Baumel, who is an RPR party",12
NA,"member of the French National Assembly,",12
NA,who put their case strongly. I must say that,12
NA,M. Baumel believed very much in nuclear,12
NA,issues. I might conclude by reminding the,12
NA,parliament of something he said last Thursday,12
NA,in Paris when he delivered a report as the,12
NA,parliamentary representative of the French,12
NA,Defence Commission. He said he doubts that,12
NA,the new generation of French warheads can be,12
NA,perfected in the current series of underground,12
NA,tests and that more tests may be needed. M.,12
NA,"Baumel, unfortunately, has learned nothing.",12

NA,Report,12
Mr CHYNOWETH ,Dunkley) (12.40,12
NA,p.m.)-On behalf of the Joint Standing Com-,12
NA,mittee on the National Capital and External,12
NA,"Territories, I present the committee's report,",12
NA,"incorporating a dissenting report, on the Nat-",12
NA,ional Capital Plan-Draft amendment No. 14,12
NA,(Broadacre Areas) to the National Capital,12
NA,"Plan, together with the evidence received by",12
NA,the committee.,12
NA,Ordered that the report be printed.,13
Mr CHYNOWETH,On 10 November,13
NA,"1994, the Hon. Brian Howe MP, the Minister",13
NA,for Housing and Regional Development and,13
NA,"the then Deputy Prime Minister, invited the",13
NA,"committee to inquire into, and report on, draft",13
NA,amendment No. 14 to the National Capital,13
NA,Plan.,13
NA,Draft amendment No. 14 of the National,13
NA,Capital Plan seeks to expand the range of,13
NA,permitted land uses from the current 'offen-,13
NA,sive and hazardous industries' to just the more,13
NA,general 'industries' covering four sites identi-,13
NA,"fied as sites A, B, C, and D. The area under",13
NA,consideration lies within broadacre areas in,13
NA,the National Capital Plan.,13
NA,"The area of land is bounded by Oaks Estate,",13
NA,"the ACT-NSW border, Canberra Avenue and",13
NA,the Molonglo River corridor. It includes the,13
NA,sites currently occupied by the Canberra,13
NA,abattoir and the Canberra tannery.,13
NA,The committee conducted a site inspection,13
NA,of the area covered by draft amendment No.,13
NA,"14 on 27 February 1995. In addition, the",13
NA,committee took evidence from key interested,13
NA,parties at public hearings on 27 February and,13
NA,6 March 1995. Written submissions were also,13
NA,received as evidence for the inquiry.,13
NA,The inquiry took longer than anticipated.,13
NA,The investigation process raised a number of,13
NA,contentious issues which were debated by the,13
NA,committee over a considerable period of time.,13
NA,This inquiry highlighted some of the diffi-,13
NA,culties in looking at land use purposes operat-,13
NA,ing under two planning regimes in the nation-,13
NA,al capital. In the Australian Capital Territory,13
NA,both Commonwealth and ACT legislation,13
NA,operate and there are two 'plans' known as,13
NA,the National Capital Plan and the Territory,13
NA,"Plan, which are the responsibility of the Na-",13
NA,tional Capital Planning Authority and the,13
NA,"ACT Planning Authority, respectively. I think",13
NA,it is inevitable that differences between the,13
NA,plans will occur. From time to time I wonder,13
NA,why land in the ACT has to be treated differ-,13
NA,ently from land in the rest of Australia.,13
NA,The only reason the committee received this,13
NA,reference was that there was an anomaly,13
NA,between the National Capital Plan and the,13
NA,Territory Plan. The National Capital Plan only,13
NA,permitted 'hazardous and offensive industries',13
NA,"on the sites, while the Territory Plan permit-",13
NA,ted 'industries' for all but one site within the,13
NA,"draft amendment area. However, the Territory",13
NA,Plan has no effect if it is inconsistent with the,13
NA,National Capital Plan.,13
NA,The impetus for draft amendment No. 14,13
NA,was an application by P.D. Mulligan (Hold-,13
NA,"ings) Pty Ltd, the parent company of the",13
NA,"proprietors of the Canberra abattoir, to vary",13
NA,its lease in the hope it could develop the site,13
NA,into an industrial estate of some 50 blocks.,13
NA,Draft amendment No. 14 does not itself,13
NA,result in an automatic change in land use on,13
NA,the abattoir site as there are mandatory pro-,13
NA,cesses required by the ACT government,13
NA,"before any change in land use, or any devel-",13
NA,"opment application, can be approved.",13
NA,Draft amendment No. 14 raised several,13
NA,important issues which are dealt with in detail,13
NA,in the report. The committee considered the,13
NA,"extent of the area of sites A, B, C, and D",13
NA,proposed in draft amendment No. 14. An,13
NA,"examination of the issues, including the",13
NA,amenity of nearby residents; the need for an,13
NA,adequate buffer zone to allow screening,13
NA,between any development in the area and,13
NA,Canberra Avenue; and the concerns of the,13
NA,Queanbeyan City Council. The need to reduce,13
NA,anomalies between the National Capital Plan,13
NA,and the Territory Plan led the committee to,13
NA,conclude that it would be more appropriate if,13
NA,the effect of draft amendment No. 14 was,13
NA,"confined to sites A, Band D, thereby exclud-",13
NA,"ing site C. Consequently, the committee",13
NA,"recommends that draft amendment No. 14, as",13
NA,"originally proposed, not be agreed to.",13
NA,"Further, the committee recommends that the",13
NA,National Capital Plan's range of permitted,13
NA,land use be expanded to permit industry on,13
NA,"sites A, Band D, the details of which are",13
NA,"given in the report, and that any industry",13
NA,proposed be subject to environmental assess-,13
NA,ment. This recommendation is conditional on,13
NA,"a number of undertakings being fulfilled, and",13
NA,these undertakings are outlined in the report.,13
NA,The committee recommends that site C not,13
NA,be used for industry but permits the normal,13
NA,range of non-special uses for broadacre areas,13
NA,"in the National Capital Plan. In conclusion, I",13
NA,wish to thank the committee members for,13
NA,their participation in the committee's deliber-,14
NA,ations. I particularly thank the secretariat and,14
NA,those people who worked on this very com-,14
NA,"plex issue. On behalf of the committee, I",14
NA,would like to thank all those who gave,14
NA,evidence to this inquiry in submissions and,14
NA,those who also gave evidence at public,14
NA,hearings.,14
Mr LANGMORE ,Fraser) (12.45 p.m.)-,14
NA,Even though there was some dispute in this,14
NA,"inquiry on the National Capital Plan, the Joint",14
NA,Standing Committee on the National Capital,14
NA,and External Territories nevertheless con-,14
NA,tinues to work harmoniously in its processes.,14
NA,"There is a dissenting report from this inquiry,",14
NA,"as the chair, the member for Dunkley ( Mr",14
NA,"Chynoweth), has said. Five of the members",14
NA,"signed the dissenting report, and that is",14
NA,unusual. The issue in the inquiry was really,14
NA,about the process through which planning,14
NA,should take place in the ACT. Those who,14
NA,signed the dissenting report considered that,14
NA,"the process should involve, in this case,",14
NA,deciding on the needs for industrial land and,14
NA,deciding where in the city industrial estates,14
NA,should be best located and then planning it,14
NA,properly. That is not what happened in this,14
NA,case.,14
NA,In this case an abattoir owner decided that,14
NA,"he wanted to move his abattoir elsewhere and,",14
NA,in order to make as much out of the land that,14
NA,"he occupied as possible, asked for permission",14
NA,to redevelop that land as an industrial estate.,14
NA,If he had received the agreement he had been,14
NA,"seeking, he would have been driving the",14
NA,process of industrial development in the ACT,14
NA,at his own convenience rather than in terms,14
NA,of the best planning process and the best,14
NA,characteristics of the location for an industrial,14
NA,estate in the ACT.,14
NA,All the dissenting members considered that,14
NA,inadequate evidence had been given to judge,14
NA,whether this was the best location for an,14
NA,"industrial estate, that it was therefore inappro-",14
NA,priate to give approval for this application and,14
NA,that the land should have been returned to the,14
NA,ACT government for it to then consider what,14
NA,the appropriate use should be. In a very,14
NA,"carefully worded dissent, we said:",14
NA,While recognising that there would be risks in its,14
NA,"proposed investment as a developer, and acknow-",14
NA,ledging that betterment would be payable to the,14
NA,"ACT Government, there is no justification for the",14
NA,present lessee potentially to profit from such a,14
NA,substantial change of use-,14
NA,as he was proposing or requesting-,14
NA,nor for it automatically to become the developer of,14
NA,what would be effectively a new industrial suburb,14
NA,without competing for that right.,14
NA,It is a question of the balance of return to an,14
NA,individual lessee as against the whole com-,14
NA,munity and also about the role for individual,14
NA,initiative as against the proper planning,14
NA,process in the interests of the whole com-,14
NA,munity of the territory and in this case the,14
NA,surrounding town of Queanbeyan.,14
NA,We therefore oppose the recommendation,14
NA,"in its original form, or its amended form, and",14
NA,propose that the land be returned to the ACT,14
NA,government. If there were a need for an,14
NA,additional industrial estate-about which quite,14
NA,insufficient evidence was given to the com-,14
NA,mittee-then the ACT government could,14
NA,respond to that in the appropriate way. In,14
NA,"conclusion, I would like to thank the chair for",14
NA,"his effective role in this quite difficult inquiry,",14
NA,"the committee secretariat and, in particular,",14
NA,"the committee secretary, Meg Crooks, for her",14
NA,very impartial handling of this inquiry.,14
Mr SMYTH ,Canberra) (12.50 p.m.)-I,14
NA,thank the House for this opportunity to speak,14
NA,on the report entitled Draft amendment No. 14,14
NA,(Broadacre Areas) to the National Capital,14
NA,Plan. The Joint Standing Committee on the,14
NA,National Capital and External Territories has,14
NA,recommended that the original draft amend-,14
NA,ment not be agreed to. The committee has,14
NA,taken great care in its deliberations to ensure,14
NA,that the residents of Oaks Estate were protect-,14
NA,ed from both environmental degradation and,14
NA,"various pollutants, such as noise and odours,",14
NA,which are common hazards of industrial sites,14
NA,"and also to ensure that there is a buffer zone,",14
NA,which is marked C on the maps.,14
NA,The committee has also noted that the,14
NA,process by which draft amendment No. 14,14
NA,was conceived and developed raises some,14
NA,questions about land use and planning in the,14
NA,ACT and some of the ad hoc nature of how,14
NA,"that goes about. Indeed, before the Joint",14
NA,Committee on Public Works at this very,14
NA,moment are other works that highlight the,14
NA,process that faces the development of Can-,15
NA,berra.,15
NA,"With that in mind, I am pleased that the",15
NA,ACT government and the Commonwealth,15
NA,have established the metropolitan Canberra,15
NA,growth strategy review to see whether some,15
NA,of these dilemmas that led to the dissenting,15
NA,report can be ironed out. As the chair of the,15
NA,"committee, the member for Dunkley ( Mr",15
NA,"Chynoweth) has said, the time spent on this",15
NA,report indicates the difficulties that the com-,15
NA,"mittee experienced. Hopefully, the new review",15
NA,will overcome some of those anomalies and,15
NA,difficulties. But before this process even,15
NA,continues the applicant will now have to,15
NA,become involved in the ACT planning pro-,15
NA,cess.,15
NA,The committee has recommended that the,15
NA,broad range of uses permitted in broadacre,15
NA,areas in the National Capital Plan be amend-,15
NA,ed. It wants to limit an expanded range of,15
NA,"permitted industry to sites A, Band D only,",15
NA,on the land to the west of Oaks Estate on the,15
NA,north side of Canberra A venue and to ensure,15
NA,"that industry proposed for sites A, Band D is",15
NA,subject to environmental assessment and is all,15
NA,conditional on the undertakings put before it.,15
NA,The committee has also recommended that all,15
NA,"industry, including hazardous or offensive",15
NA,"industry, not be permitted on site C but that",15
NA,the normal range of non-special area uses for,15
NA,broadacre areas in the National Capital Plan,15
NA,be permitted.,15
NA,I would like to take this opportunity to,15
NA,"thank the secretariat staff, and in particular",15
NA,"Meg Crooks, of the Joint Standing Committee",15
NA,on the National Capital and External Territor-,15
NA,ies for all their hard work in the writing and,15
NA,deliverance of this report. I would also like,15
NA,"acknowledge the work of the chairman, in",15
NA,working both sides to an agreeable report that,15
NA,is now before this House. I commend the,15
NA,report to the House.,15
Mr CHYNOWETH ,Dunkley)-I move:,15
NA,That the House take note of the report.,15
NA,I seek leave to continue my remarks later.,15
NA,Leave granted.,15
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Jenkins)-,15
NA,"In accordance with standing order 102B, the",15
NA,debate is adjourned. The resumption of the,15
NA,debate will be made an order of the day for,15
NA,the next sitting Monday and the member will,15
NA,have leave to continue speaking when the,15
NA,debate is resumed.,15
NA,Corporations and Securities Committee,15
NA,Report,15
Mr STEPHEN SMITH ,Perth) (12.53,15
NA,p.m.)-On behalf of the Joint Committee on,15
NA,"Corporations and Securities, I present the",15
NA,committee's report on limitation on institution,15
NA,of criminal proceedings under section 1316 of,15
NA,"the Corporations Law, together with the",15
NA,evidence received by the committee.,15
NA,Ordered that the report be printed.,15
Mr STEPHEN SMITH,One of the tasks,15
NA,of the Joint Committee on Corporations and,15
NA,Securities since its formation in 1991 has,15
NA,been monitoring the investigation and pros-,15
NA,ecution of breaches of corporate law in the,15
NA,"1980s, with a particular concern about delay",15
NA,in resolving these matters. These events and,15
NA,the investigations resulting from them are now,15
NA,"up to eight years old, with a number still to",15
NA,"be brought before the courts. For example, the",15
NA,decision of the Attorney-General ( Mr,15
NA,"Lavarch), pursuant to section 1316 of the",15
NA,"Corporations Law, to consent to the com-",15
NA,"mencement of proceedings against Mr Bond,",15
NA,Mr Oates and Mr Mitchell in relation to a,15
NA,Bell Resources matter is a reminder that,15
NA,matters of great complexity requiring very,15
NA,considerable application of the resources of,15
NA,"the Australian Securities Commission, the",15
NA,Director of Public Prosecutions and the courts,15
NA,are still to be resolved.,15
NA,"In October 1993, the Chairman of the",15
NA,"to Australian Securities Commission, Mr Alan",15
NA,"Cameron, commented publicly that 'Section",15
NA,1316 of the Corporations Law may impede,15
NA,"the prosecution of corporate crime, particular-",15
NA,ly in complex cases'. The committee raised,15
NA,this issue with Mr Cameron when he appeared,15
NA,before a public hearing of the committee in,15
NA,April 1994. Mr Cameron said:,15
NA,The difficulty is that any such decision is itself,15
NA,capable of being reviewed ... The only thing that,15
NA,is certain is that an aggressive defendant's first ploy,15
NA,"will be to tie us up, potentially for years, in admin-",15
NA,istrative review of the Attorney-General's decision,15
NA,to extend the time. That is the reason we are not,15
NA,sure why there needs to be a special rule for,16
NA,corporate crime.,16
NA,Options considered by the committee in its,16
NA,inquiry included: repealing the present limita-,16
NA,tion period in relation to indictable offences;,16
NA,increasing the limitation period from five to,16
NA,seven years or retaining the Attorney-,16
NA,"General's discretion, with the removal of any",16
NA,right of review of the exercise of the discre-,16
NA,tion; or no change.,16
NA,Evidence before the committee focused on,16
NA,"the distinction between indictable offences,",16
NA,subject to no general limitation period under,16
NA,"the Crimes Act 1914, and summary offences,",16
NA,which are subject to a 12-month limitation,16
NA,period under the Crimes Act. Arguments,16
NA,favouring the abolition of the Attorney-,16
NA,General's consent were that it will put corpo-,16
NA,rate criminal prosecutions on the same basis,16
NA,as the general criminal law and it is not an,16
NA,appropriate role for the Attorney-General,16
NA,under the current independent prosecution,16
NA,process.,16
NA,Arguments advanced advocating retention,16
NA,of section 1316 stressed that the limitation,16
NA,period should apply to indictable offences,16
NA,under the Corporations Law as limitations in,16
NA,general act as a discipline on agencies to,16
NA,ensure expeditious investigatory and prosecu-,16
NA,tion processes. The committee found that,16
NA,there should be no limitation period for,16
NA,serious or indictable offences under the,16
NA,Corporations Law and that section 1316 of,16
NA,the Corporations Law should be amended,16
NA,accordingly.,16
NA,"In the case of summary offences, the com-",16
NA,mittee decided that these offences should be,16
NA,subject to a limitation period of five years,16
NA,without any capacity on the part of the Attor-,16
NA,ney-General to extend. The committee found,16
NA,that the Crimes Act limitation period of 12,16
NA,months would not allow proper investigation,16
NA,of summary offences under the Corporations,16
NA,"Law, some of which involve quite serious",16
NA,breaches of corporate behaviour. I draw the,16
NA,House's attention to the opinion tabled in,16
NA,respect of this matter by Senator Cooney.,16
NA,A central point in the submissions advocat-,16
NA,ing retention of the limitation period and the,16
NA,discretion in the Attorney-General was that,16
NA,such a discretion provided enhanced accounta-,16
NA,bility for the exercise of the already wide,16
NA,powers of the ASC and the DPP. Contrary,16
NA,arguments to the committee stressed two,16
NA,important points of accountability: judicial or,16
NA,administrative review of a prosecution deci-,16
NA,sion and the courts limiting the commence-,16
NA,ment of prosecutions due to abuse of process.,16
NA,Recent decisions indicate that suspect pro-,16
NA,ceedings will not easily escape the court's,16
NA,scrutiny. The committee does not agree that,16
NA,the addition of a discretion in the Attorney-,16
NA,General to allow an extended period of,16
NA,prosecution will enhance this protection.,16
NA,The committee concluded that the current,16
NA,discretion of the Attorney-General does not,16
NA,significantly add to the proper and desirable,16
NA,level of protection of persons accused under,16
NA,various provisions of the Corporations Law.,16
NA,"As well, since the creation of the office of the",16
NA,DPP-a statutory independent prosecuting,16
NA,authority-it would be anomalous for the,16
NA,Attorney-General to retain an effective,16
NA,prosecutorial discretion such as that currently,16
NA,contained in section 1316. The committee,16
NA,believes that serious corporate criminal,16
NA,offences should be placed on the same basis,16
NA,as serious general criminal offences.,16
NA,"The committee does, however, believe that",16
NA,the DPP and the ASC should include extra,16
NA,information in their annual reports to provide,16
NA,some better information on the DPP's deci-,16
NA,sions in relation to corporate offences. The,16
NA,committee is concerned that in future a clear,16
NA,picture be presented each year of the number,16
NA,"of current matters in the hands of the DPP,",16
NA,the time that has elapsed since the alleged,16
NA,commission of offences that may be involved,16
NA,"but in each matter, and the state each matter has",16
NA,"reached in the investigation, assessment and",16
NA,prosecution process. The committee believes,16
NA,that such a picture will allow the responsible,16
NA,minister and the parliament to better ensure,16
NA,that there is appropriate public information on,16
NA,the ASC's and the DPP's administration of,16
NA,this area of their responsibilities.,16
NA,The committee has formally recommended,16
NA,in its report that future annual reports of the,16
NA,Australian Securities Commission and the,16
NA,Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecu-,16
NA,tions provide detailed information showing,16
NA,the time that has elapsed since the commis-,16
NA,sion of alleged offences under the Corpora-,17
NA,tions Law and the time that has elapsed since,17
NA,the commencement of active investigative and,17
NA,prosecutorial processes. I commend the report,17
NA,to the House. (Time expired),17
Mr SINCLAIR ,New England) (12.58,17
NA,p.m.)-The report on limitation on institution,17
NA,of criminal proceedings under section 1316 of,17
NA,the Corporations Law of the Joint Committee,17
NA,on Corporations and Securities just tabled by,17
NA,the honourable member for Perth ( Mr Stephen,17
NA,Smith) has my endorsement. I want to com-,17
NA,"ment on several aspects of the report. Firstly,",17
NA,it is important that people understand that the,17
NA,aftermath of all the disasters of the entrepre-,17
NA,neurs of the 1980s should not generate an,17
NA,undue legislative response from this parlia-,17
NA,"ment, nor should it create the expectation that",17
NA,every company dealing is illegal or improper.,17
NA,When this reference was first given to the,17
NA,committee I was concerned that this was just,17
NA,another instance of the ASC attempting to,17
NA,extend jurisdiction in a way which was going,17
NA,to prejudice the proper functioning of the,17
NA,"marketplace and, in particular, of companies",17
NA,in the Australian financial structure.,17
NA,I am convinced that that is not so. My own,17
NA,view had been that the period of five years,17
NA,within which the ASC should initiate proceed-,17
NA,"ings should be retained, basically because I",17
NA,felt that for both summary and indictable,17
NA,offences it was necessary for a party at arms,17
NA,length to ensure that every attempt had been,17
NA,made by the ASC to initiate proceedings as,17
NA,soon as possible. Having heard the evidence,17
NA,"and having considered the matter, however, I",17
NA,concur with the conclusions of this report.,17
NA,It has been only four years since the Directhat,17
NA,"tor of Public Prosecutions, the DPP, has taken",17
NA,over from the Attorney-General responsibility,17
NA,for prosecutions. I believe that the manner of,17
NA,assessment by the DPP replaces the role,17
NA,previously exercised in the prosecution sense,17
NA,"by the Attorney-General. Accordingly, I",17
NA,accept the fact that this is an appropriate,17
NA,"deletion. Therefore, the committee's recom-",17
NA,mendation that there should no longer be a,17
NA,"necessity for the minister, or the Attorney-",17
NA,"General in this instance, to give approval after",17
NA,five years should be proceeded with. That is,17
NA,the recommendation of both the DPP and the,17
NA,"ASC. For that reason, I think there is now a",17
NA,better practice.,17
NA,I note the dissenting report of Senator,17
NA,Cooney. I do not agree with that because I,17
NA,believe it is difficult for summary offences to,17
NA,be prosecuted at too early a stage. The com-,17
NA,mittee report stated that there would still be,17
NA,a time within which it would be possible for,17
NA,summary offences to be prosecuted and be,17
NA,retained but that they be removed altogether,17
NA,for indictable offences. I believe it is appro-,17
NA,priate that the indictable offence removal be,17
NA,"proceeded with. At the same time, I suggest",17
NA,that the DPP has a responsibility to ensure,17
NA,that the normal procedures and practices,17
NA,regarding the reasonableness of prosecution,17
NA,be considered very carefully.,17
NA,"My worry has been, and it is a fact that was",17
NA,"presented in evidence to the committee, that",17
NA,after seven years it is no longer necessary to,17
NA,keep records. While there have been a number,17
NA,of incredible abuses of proper accounting and,17
NA,prudential responsibility by a number of,17
NA,"corporate figures, that does not mean that all",17
NA,have done so. It would be unreasonable if a,17
NA,prosecution were initiated against a person,17
NA,"simply on the basis that time has lapsed,",17
NA,prosecution was not commenced at a reason-,17
NA,able time and records had been destroyed. I,17
NA,think that seven-year period within which,17
NA,people are required to keep records needs to,17
NA,be kept in mind.,17
NA,At the same time I think the five-year,17
NA,limitation for summary offences is reasonable.,17
NA,For that reason I believe it is appropriate for,17
NA,"it to be retained, as the committee has recom-",17
NA,mended. Its removal altogether does not mean,17
NA,unlimited time will be available. It means,17
NA,that in any instance where the ASC recom-,17
NA,mends prosecution the officers of the Director,17
NA,of Public Prosecutions will be available to,17
NA,supervise the exercise of that prosecution. I,17
NA,believe in that instance the report makes,17
NA,"sense. For that reason, I support the recom-",17
NA,mendations of the committee and commend,17
NA,the chairman and the members of the secre-,17
NA,tariat for the work they have undertaken in,17
NA,the preparation of this report.,17

NA,gether with the minutes of proceedings.,18
NA,Ordered that the report be printed.,18
NA,NA,18
NA,Warehouse to whaifwas tabled in April 1992.,18
NA,It highlighted the benefits that could be,18
NA,achieved if Australian firms better coordinated,18
NA,their services along the transport chain to the,18
NA,"waterfront. It revealed an 'appalling apathy,",18
NA,ignorance and inertia on the part of users of,18
NA,waterfront services'. Three and a half years,18
NA,"on there has been little change, although we",18
NA,"have seen improvements in some areas, with",18
NA,some service providers having shown a,18
NA,willingness to improve communication and,18
NA,coordination between parties operating at the,18
NA,"port interface. Outdated financial, documen-",18
NA,tary and logistic practices are continuing,18
NA,impediments to Australian products becoming,18
NA,more competitive abroad.,18
NA,"Waterfront productivity is important, yet",18
NA,efficient use of transport services to the,18
NA,waterfront is even more important to export-,18
NA,"ers, importers, and Australia's international",18
NA,competitiveness. Service providers and their,18
NA,customers need to develop a team approach,18
NA,to maximising the productivity and efficiency,18
NA,of port related services. The committee is,18
NA,convinced that much greater progress would,18
NA,have been made if the interface efficiency,18
NA,"councils, recommended in the 1992 report,",18
NA,had been established at all of Australia's,18
NA,"major ports. Accordingly, the committee has",18
NA,again recommended they be established in all,18
NA,major ports to facilitate the efficient move-,18
NA,ment of cargo to and from the waterfront and,18
NA,to ensure effective communication and coordi-,18
NA,nation at the port interface.,18
NA,I now tum to electronic data interchange.,18
NA,The national consultative group has been,18
NA,successful in developing a common approach,18
NA,to the promotion of electronic commerce in,18
NA,"the transport industry. However, a significant",18
NA,impediment to the use of electronic commerce,18
NA,by small business in all industries as well as,18
NA,the transport sector has been the availability,18
NA,of cost-effective electronic data interchange,18
NA,softwa.re. The committee has recommended,18
NA,"that the Commonwealth government, through",18
NA,"the Department of Industry, Science and",18
NA,"Technology, fund a detailed assessment of the",18
NA,current environment for software develop-,18
NA,ment.,18
NA,Transport costs to the wharf are not a,18
NA,"priority for small exporters. However, taken",18
NA,"together, they constitute a major factor in",18
NA,improving Australia's international competi-,18
NA,tiveness. By focusing public debate solely on,18
NA,"the waterfront, industry associations, govern-",18
NA,ments and politicians mask the many prob-,18
NA,lems which remain in the transport chain to,18
NA,the wharf. This is a lazy and obstructive,18
NA,approach to a difficult and complex logistics,18
NA,problem.,18
NA,"I thank the deputy chairman, Mr Stewart",18
NA,"MCArthur, and my fellow committee members",18
NA,for their cooperation in the conduct of this,18
NA,"inquiry. I thank also the committee secretariat,",18
NA,"including the secretary, Mr Malcolm Aldons;",18
NA,"Mr Les Dunn; and administrative officer, Mrs",18
NA,June Murphy. Special thanks are due to Mr,18
NA,"John Jenkins, consultant, and Mr Robert",18
NA,Tranter of the Department of Transport.,18
NA,I tum now to the report in respect of oil,19
NA,spills. Given the adverse effect of oil spills,19
NA,the marine environment and the significant,19
NA,"public interest in the Ships of shame report,",19
NA,the committee welcomed the opportunity to,19
NA,review the report of the Auditor-General: Is,19
NA,Australia ready to respond to a major oil,19
NA,spill? Our work complements the committee's,19
NA,work earlier on ship safety. Pollution of the,19
NA,sea by oil is a major world problem. Given,19
NA,"Australia's 37,000 kilometres of coastline, and",19
NA,"our diverse marine environment, the threat of",19
NA,"an oil spoil is particularly significant. Thus,",19
NA,it is essential that Australia has an adequately,19
NA,resourced oil spill prevention strategy.,19
NA,The audit report focused on the Australian,19
NA,Maritime Safety Authority's management of,19
NA,a national oil plan to combat pollution of the,19
NA,sea by oil. The committee notes that the,19
NA,Australian Maritime Safety Authority has,19
NA,agreed to 15 of the 18 recommendations in,19
NA,the Auditor's report. The committee adjudicat-,19
NA,ed on those areas of disagreement. The key,19
NA,feature of an oil spill strategy is prevention.,19
NA,Fundamental to prevention is crew competen-,19
NA,cy.,19
NA,As mentioned in the committee's Ships of,19
NA,"shame report, human factors are the principal",19
NA,cause of shipping incidents and accidents.,19
NA,Public and media attention focuses too often,19
NA,"on isolated tanker collisions, ruptures and",19
NA,"spillages. Tanker accidents, however, account",19
NA,for only 12 per cent of oil pollution of the,19
NA,marine environment. General vessel oper-,19
NA,ations account for 33 per cent and industrial,19
NA,discharge and urban run-off account for 37,19
NA,per cent. The committee is concerned that,19
NA,insufficient attention is given to other marine,19
NA,pollutants such as hazardous and noxious,19
NA,substances. Many chemicals transported by,19
NA,sea present greater danger to people and to,19
NA,the environment than crude oil.,19
NA,The committee has made four recommenda-,19
NA,tions relating to the development of shore line,19
NA,"clean-up standards, crew competency, oil",19
NA,sampling practices and risk assessment. The,19
NA,port of Newcastle is the only authority in,19
NA,Australia which collects samples of ships' oil.,19
NA,The Newcastle program is intended to raise,19
NA,awareness about the impact on the environ-,19
NA,ment of marine pollution and to gather oil,19
NA,samples as potential evidence which in the,19
NA,on case of prosecution may become necessary.,19
NA,Since the port of Newcastle commenced,19
NA,collecting samples of on board fuel and bilge,19
NA,"oil from ships in harbour, there has been a",19
NA,marked decrease in pollution incidents. The,19
NA,committee recommended that the national,19
NA,"plan advisory committee, as a matter of",19
NA,"urgency, request that all its members intro-",19
NA,duce oil sampling practices similar to those in,19
NA,operation in Newcastle. The grounding of the,19
NA,"Iron Baron, resulting in a spillage of 350",19
NA,"tonnes of fuel oil, occurred during the review.",19
NA,Due to time limitations and inquiries that are,19
NA,"under way elsewhere, only brief reference has",19
NA,been made to the Iron Baron in this report. It,19
NA,is a matter that should be examined more,19
NA,closely by this committee in the next parlia-,19
NA,ment.,19
NA,The committee's interim assessment sug-,19
NA,gests that the risk assessment criteria under-,19
NA,rated the navigational difficulty in the River,19
NA,Tamar area of the Tasmanian coast where the,19
NA,"Iron Baron came to grief. In conclusion, I",19
NA,"thank the deputy chairman, Mr Stewart",19
NA,"MCArthur, and my fellow committee members",19
NA,for their cooperation and support in the,19
NA,conduct of this inquiry. I also thank the,19
NA,"committee secretariat, including the secretary,",19
NA,"Mr Malcolm Aldons; the inquiry secretary,",19
NA,Mr Stephen Boyd; and the administrative,19
NA,"officers, Mrs June Murphy and Mrs Sue Cox,",19
NA,for their dedicated efforts in the production of,19
NA,this report.,19
Mr HOLLIS ,Throsby) (1.11 p.m.)-I,19
NA,would like to add a few words to those in the,19
NA,two reports just tabled by the Chairman of the,19
NA,"Standing Committee on Transport, Communi-",19
NA,cations and Infrastructure. As the chairman,19
NA,"has so rightly said, little has changed on the",19
NA,waterfront since we reported a couple of years,19
NA,ago. There is too much blaming others on the,19
NA,waterfront. Everyone seems to be protecting,19
NA,their own bailiwick. It is all very well to,19
NA,blame one sector but it is not as if there is,19
NA,one entity; it is a whole conglomerate. There,19
NA,is a chain-and every link plays an important,19
NA,"part. We have found too often that, on the",19
NA,"waterfront, everyone blames the other person",19
NA,or the other group instead of looking at,19
NA,themselves. Until we can realistically come to,19
NA,grips with that and look at the whole of the,20
NA,waterfront-not just sectional interests-we,20
NA,are not going to make great strides towards,20
NA,the reforms that we all want.,20
NA,"I turn now to oil spills, in which I have a",20
NA,"particular interest. Being an island continent,",20
NA,it is very important that we protect our coast-,20
NA,line. People think that when oil spills occur,20
NA,it is always great tankers that have come to,20
NA,grief. As the chairman of the committee has,20
NA,"said, it concerns such things as urban run-off",20
NA,and spillage from ships. In my own electorate,20
NA,"of Throsby, at Shell harbour a coastal ship",20
NA,carrying blue metal from Bass Point to Syd-,20
NA,ney two or three weeks ago ran aground,20
NA,"through, I believe, crew incompetence-",20
NA,although I suppose I will get the usual angry,20
NA,letters for saying that. Had the wind not,20
NA,"changed dramatically when it did, the ship",20
NA,would have broken on the rocks. There would,20
NA,have been an oil spill for many miles along,20
NA,the beaches of the south coast. We are finding,20
NA,"increasingly that, with the number of vessels",20
NA,"coming onto the Australian coastline, the",20
NA,competence of the crew is an important,20
NA,matter.,20
NA,I was horrified to hear on the ABC news,20
NA,just this morning as I was driving to Canberra,20
NA,"that a Korean ship, the Cape Star, went",20
NA,through the Great Barrier Reef-the honour-,20
NA,able member for Dawson ( Mr Braithwaite),20
NA,would be well aware of the necessity to,20
NA,protect that pristine area-without a pilot,20
NA,when there is compulsory pilotage in that,20
NA,region. It was a sugar ship-and the member,20
NA,NA,20
NA,some examples of sugar ships that he has,20
NA,dealt with recently. This ship is under arrest,20
NA,"in Cairns at the moment. Interestingly, no-one",20
NA,quite knows who owns the sugar. I think it is,20
NA,split up between 11 people. It is quite amaz-,20
NA,ing. The captain decided to go through that,20
NA,area without a pilot-even though there is,20
NA,compulsory pilotage.,20
NA,I hear from the unions-they are contacting,20
NA,me again later today-that there is a question,20
NA,about crew wages. How many times do we on,20
NA,the committee hear that story. There are,20
NA,"underpaid, underfed and physically abused",20
NA,crews on these ships. It all comes down to the,20
NA,question of crew competence. It is time that,20
NA,we looked at the competence of some of the,20
NA,crews that are coming to Australia. Our,20
NA,coastline is at risk. Despite recent changes to,20
NA,"the law, the final person who will pay for the",20
NA,clean-up to the Australian coastline when it is,20
NA,"polluted with dirty, greasy oil is the Austral-",20
NA,ian taxpayer. We will be paying for it. I hope,20
NA,that the captain of the Cape Star is fined,20
NA,severely and put in gaol and that this non-,20
NA,sense will stop. I commend the report. I,20
NA,commend the chairman for his exemplary,20
NA,leading of that committee. I also commend,20
NA,the committee staff for their work.,20

NA,"professional groups, consumer bodies and",20
NA,"individual subcontractors, et cetera. I will be",20
NA,seeking the maximum possible degree of,20
NA,consultation.,20
NA,"I feel that, if it is to succeed, this bill will",21
NA,require a detailed analysis not only of the,21

NA,the constituent subcontractor Mr Ken Weir.,21
NA,He is a plumber in Mackay who has seen me,21
NA,regularly over many years on this matter. I,21
NA,also thank the clerks of the House for their,21

NA,stage.,21
NA,KENNETT GOVERNMENT,21
Mr CLEELAND ,MCEwen) (1.19 p.m.)-I,21
NA,move:,21
NA,That this House take note of the devastation,21
NA,caused to small business and rural communities by,21
NA,the Kennett government's policies.,21
NA,In all the discussions of the effects and,21
NA,consequences of privatisation its effect on the,21
NA,individual lives and communities of rural,21
NA,Australians has been totally overlooked. That,21
NA,also applies to the effect on individual lives,21
NA,in communities of rural Victoria following the,21
NA,introduction and doubling of the number of,21
NA,electronic gaming machines in Victoria.,21
NA,Social policies since 1945 combined with,21
NA,other features like population mobility and,21
NA,economic and technological factors more,21
NA,generally have all improved the status of rural,21
NA,people. Whilst there is a convergence of the,21
NA,"needs of rural and metropolitan people, and",21
NA,similarities concerning disadvantage such as,21
NA,"poverty and isolation, rural disadvantage is",21
NA,"found across a number of social, economic",21
NA,and service indices compared with urban,21
NA,Australia.,21
NA,These disadvantages include higher poverty,21
NA,"and unemployment levels in rural Australia,",21
NA,more extensive mortality and morbidity,21
NA,"rates-for example, the VFF has claimed that",21
NA,children on farms are three times more likely,21
NA,to die from an accident than their city,21
NA,counterparts-higher price levels in the,21
NA,"country, reduced educational and occupational",21
NA,"attainment and expectations, and reduced",21
NA,access to health and welfare services. They,21
NA,also must face additional factors such as,21
NA,"flood, fire, drought and extremes of tempera-",21
NA,ture sometimes destroying both life and means,21
NA,"of livelihood, yet the Victorian government is",21
NA,totally ignoring the needs of rural Victorians,21
NA,and rural business.,21
NA,"The divisions between people, wealth and",21
NA,decision makers mirror the division between,21
NA,cities and rural Australia. Australia's cities,21
NA,have provided ideal locations for capital-that,21
NA,"is, population size, communications for",21
NA,"infrastructure, transport, markets, consumers",21
NA,and labour but there has been no serious,21
NA,attempt since the 1970s to tackle regional,21
NA,"development. Meanwhile, the rural sector has",21
NA,been in long-term relative decline-farming,21
NA,and small towns.,21
NA,In February 1995 the National Rural Out-,21
NA,"look Conference heard that farmers of beef,",21
NA,"sheep, wool and wheat could not expect to",21
NA,increase their resource base. Condliffe states,21
NA,"that the number of farmers fell by 15,000 in",21
NA,"the 15 years to 1989, the farm work force by",21
NA,"32,000 and the total rural work force by",21
NA,"100,000. Lawrence predicted that 45,000",21
NA,farmers would leave the land in the decade,21
NA,following 1987. Condliffe argues that:,21
NA,... the increasing rationalisation and privatisation,21
NA,of government services to country towns further,21
NA,emphasises the decline of employment opportuni-,21
NA,"ties, and furthers the exodus to the cities. Many",21
NA,rural towns rely upon such services not only for the,21
NA,jobs provided but the income input into the local,21
NA,"economy. This, coupled with the restructuring of",21
NA,"other industries like meatworks, many of which",21
NA,have been closed across rural Australia ...,21
NA,It is also argued that:,21
NA,"... new technologies, in communications, ration-",21
NA,"alisation of the transport industry, and continued",21
NA,decline of manufacturing further exacerbates the,21
NA,plight of these communi tie.,21
NA,The Evatt Research Centre has found that the,21
NA,pivotal role of the public sector as a major,21
NA,employer in rural Australia 'is increasingly no,21
NA,longer the case'. Given that in rural towns the,21
NA,"public sector was the largest employer, tradi-",21
NA,tionally providing stability through seasonal,21
NA,"and other variations in the local economy, the",21
NA,effect of privatisation can be disturbing for a,22
NA,number of reasons.,22
NA,Communities are hit twice when the em-,22
NA,ployment opportunities as well as the services,22
NA,are privatised and rationalised away from,22
NA,local control. On the question of privatisation,22
NA,"of electricity, there is no definitive answer",22
NA,to whether the service wiIl be cheaper. In fact,22
NA,rural community rating in Victoria is to be,22
NA,"abolished, effective from the year 2000. In",22
NA,some overseas cases it has become more,22
NA,expensive to the consumers while a minority,22
NA,of executives and captains of industry realise,22
NA,increasing wealth.,22
NA,This is what is happening in Victoria. The,22
NA,top end of town is doing very well. If you are,22
NA,"a mate of Kennett, a mate of the Liberal",22
NA,"Party, you get appointed to all the boards, you",22
NA,get appointed to run the amalgamated coun-,22
NA,cils and you get increased licences to run,22
NA,bigger casinos-more poker machines and,22
NA,"more gaming machines-without inquiry,",22
NA,"without examination, while in rural Victoria,",22
NA,"in the rural areas I represent, devastation is",22
NA,occurring.,22
NA,"For example, if you look at my own elec-",22
NA,torate you will see that the area around Lake,22
NA,Eildon is well known in Australia. It is at the,22
NA,foothills of the southern alps. It is well,22
NA,for tourism and is a very diversified farming,22
NA,"area. If you take the towns of Mansfield,",22
NA,"Eildon, AlexandrC' and Yea, you wiIl find that",22
NA,in the last two years over 100 public sector,22
NA,jobs have gone. They have gone from the,22
NA,"state Rivers and Water Supply Commission,",22
NA,from the Department of Conservation and,22
NA,"Natural Resources, from Vic Roads and from",22
NA,education. They have gone from every Vic-,22
NA,torian public sector; they have vanished.,22
NA,There are some 50 houses now for sale in,22
NA,Eildon. You cannot sell a house there. I was,22
NA,in Alexandra a week ago and five businesses,22
NA,were closing in the main street there. Small,22
NA,businesses in Yea despair. This is the direct,22
NA,result of the Kennett government. This is a,22
NA,direct result of a lack of concern and a lack,22
NA,"of care for small rural communities, and it is",22
NA,fact.,22
NA,We will hear opposition members get up,22
NA,and support Kennett. They have never been,22
NA,to a country town and talked to the people,22
NA,there. They have never been there and have,22
NA,not spoken to people. They will not deny that,22
NA,"68,000 jobs in the public sector have gone",22
NA,from Victoria. With the amalgamation of local,22
NA,"government in Victoria, it is now estimated",22
NA,"that a further 10,000 jobs are going to vanish.",22
NA,"as That is devastating, but on top of that deva-",22
NA,station caused by the so-called economic,22
NA,rationalism-I call it economic stupidity-we,22
NA,now have in Victoria a doubling of the,22
NA,number of electronic gaming machines-a,22
NA,"doubling, without any examination or inquiry.",22
NA,If you talk to people in small business in,22
NA,"rural areas, they will tell you what is happen-",22
NA,ing. About 13 per cent of a family's spending,22
NA,is called discretionary spending. With the now,22
NA,doubling of electronic gaming machines-new,22
NA,in Victoria-the number of people using that,22
NA,discretionary spending on gaming is increas-,22
NA,ing and the amount of that spending going,22
NA,into small business is diminishing.,22
NA,In Victoria it has been a double whammy,22
NA,for country towns. They have got to cope,22
NA,with Kennett and the lack of National Party,22
NA,concern for them; they have got to cope with,22
NA,the quite massive job losses from the public,22
NA,"sector, which are factual and unarguable. If",22
NA,small business loses two or three wages in the,22
NA,"known town, that is less income coming into the",22
NA,"business. It is palpable, it is evidential, it is",22
NA,there.,22
NA,"Then, on top of that, people cop an uncar-",22
NA,"ing Liberal government. It has said, 'Let's",22
NA,double the number of electronic gaming,22
NA,machines; let's not ask whether that is going,22
NA,to be effective or what the social conse-,22
NA,quences are; let's not ask whether small,22
NA,business in rural areas can cope with it.' It,22
NA,"says, 'No, we'll just do it.'",22
NA,Mr O'Connor-Double-barrelled.,22
Mr CLEELAND,That's right. It is,22
NA,"Kennett's rural bush recession, and boy is it",22
NA,out there! I am always amused when I hear,22
NA,opposition members-and we are going to,22
NA,listen to them today-say that economic,22
NA,rationalism is good. I am pleased to see the,22
NA,member for Bendigo ( Mr Reid) in the cham-,22
NA,ber and I will make sure what he says is,22
NA,"circulated in Bendigo. People in Bendigo, like",22
NA,"all of the small towns in my electorate, know",22
NA,full well that the massive job losses caused by,22
NA,Kennett and MCNamara are hurting small,23
NA,business.,23
NA,Rural Victoria is bleeding. Rural Victoria is,23
NA,being devastated. Fifteen schools in my,23
NA,electorate have gone to history. That is,23
NA,"teachers, 15 wages. Fifteen families have",23
NA,"from my rural areas. Yet Kennett only says,",23
NA,'So what?' We will get from the opposition,23
NA,talk about how this is good because the public,23
NA,sector has to be rationalised and the private,23
NA,sector is going to pick up the jobs. Rubbish!,23
NA,"The simple fact in Victoria is that, despite",23
NA,"68,000 to 70,000 public sector jobs gone,",23
NA,"there are still over 8,000 people who have",23
NA,been picked up by the private sector. This,23
NA,trickle-down effect we hear the Reagan,23
NA,economists talk about is one of the great,23
NA,"myths. Newt Gingrich, the great ally of the",23
NA,"Liberal Party, talks about the trickle-down",23
NA,effect: 'If we make people suffer a lot we,23
NA,all be better off.',23
NA,"The evidence is clear, unarguable and",23
NA,factual: rural Victoria is bleeding; rural,23
NA,Victoria is being devastated. The whole and,23
NA,sole reason for that is the massive cut to,23
NA,public sector and the massive impost of,23
NA,gaming on small rural towns. (Time expired),23
NA,Mr O'Connor-1 second the motion and allocated,23
NA,reserve my right to speak.,23
Mr CHARLES ,La Trobe) (1.30 p.m.)-I,23
NA,am delighted to rise to respond to that bit of,23
NA,dri vel by the member for MCEwen ( Mr,23
NA,Cleeland). I note that the motion before the,23
NA,House is:,23
NA,That this House takes note of the devastation,23
NA,caused to small business and rural communities,23
NA,I did not hear much about small businessincrease,23
NA,not much at all. Recently it has been a generstrong,23
NA,al tactic of the member for MCEwen and the,23
NA,member for Dunkley ( Mr Chynoweth) to,23
NA,come into this House and spend all of their,23
NA,time talking about the Kennett state governdollar,23
NA,"ment and state policies, as is in fact the tactic",23
NA,of the candidate standing against me in the,23
NA,"seat of La Trobe in Victoria, because they",23
NA,frightened to death to talk about federal,23
NA,issues. They will not talk about Paul Keating.,23
NA,They will not talk about Keating policy or,23
NA,"inept, invisible and unfunctioning cabinet",23
NA,this Keating government. They want to talk,23
NA,about Kennett and the state of Victoria.,23
NA,Let me tell you a little bit about Kennett,23
NA,and the state of Victoria. Let us talk about,23
NA,15 small business investment in Victoria so far,23
NA,gone in 1995-96-four months. Doosan Farmland,23
NA,products have a $36 million project for a,23
NA,malting plant in Geelong. Murray Goulburn,23
NA,at Cobram have a $40 million joint venture,23
NA,with Mitsubishi and Meiji Milk products of,23
NA,Japan to supply infant formula to Asia.,23
NA,the Bonlac have a $150 million investment to,23
NA,establish a world-class dairy powder plant in,23
NA,not Gippsland leading to 120 jobs. Olivetti have,23
NA,a $27 million investment to establish a re-,23
NA,gional headquarters in Melbourne that will,23
NA,create 48 jobs. The Holden's Engine Com-,23
NA,pany have a $315 million investment creating,23
NA,100 permanent jobs. Ford Australia have a,23
NA,"will $1,000 million investment, including design",23
NA,and tooling for the new Falcon.,23
NA,The Access Economics investment monitor,23
NA,records the value of publicly known invest-,23
NA,ment projects. The value of listed projects in,23
NA,the Victoria increased from $13.9 billion in,23
NA,September 1994 to $15.4 billion in September,23
NA,"1995, a rise of 11 per cent. Victoria had 14",23
NA,per cent of the total for projects which are,23
NA,"to particular states; however, Vic-",23
NA,"toria has a higher share, 25 per cent, of",23
NA,committed projects as distinct from possible,23
NA,or potential projects.,23
NA,Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows,23
NA,that Victoria's business investment has re-,23
NA,"bounded strongly, particularly since we got",23
NA,rid of the Cain and Kirner governments.,23
NA,Investment in equipment has risen 44 per cent,23
NA,"in the past three years, including a 12 per cent",23
NA,in 1994-95. The upturn has included,23
NA,growth in manufacturing investment.,23
NA,Investment growth in Victoria for 1995-96 is,23
NA,likely to be above the national average.,23
NA,The launch last week of the multimillion,23
NA,technology park at Ballarat University,23
NA,has huge potential for rural Victoria and the,23
NA,many small businesses that are actively invol-,23
NA,are ved in information technology and telecom-,23
NA,munications. That site alone is expected to,23
NA,employ around 350 people within three years.,23
NA,the With the university offering an information,23
NA,"of technology degree, complete with 20 higher",23
NA,education contribution scheme exempt schol-,24
NA,"arships as well as 10 traineeships, rural",24
NA,Victoria is well on the way to greater employ-,24
NA,ment opportunities for rural youth.,24
NA,Projects such as the Ballarat University,24
NA,technology park have been actively pursued,24
NA,by the state government. That is the Kennett,24
NA,"Victorian state government, I tell the honour-",24
NA,able member for MCEwen. They generate jobs,24
NA,in rural Victoria during the construction,24
NA,stages and offer employment in the long term,24
NA,for rural graduates from our regional universi-,24
NA,"ties. Victoria is open for business-small,",24
NA,medium and international businesses that are,24
NA,employing our youth and providing education-,24
NA,al opportunities that the Labor government,24
NA,does not even begin to understand.,24
NA,Since the change of government in Victoria,24
NA,"in October 1992, we have seen a real change",24
NA,in the outlook of many Victorians. This is,24
NA,particularly evident in the area of small,24
NA,business. The member for MCEwen reckons,24
NA,we are losing small businesses rapidly. The,24
NA,"facts are that 12,000 new small businesses",24
NA,have been started in Victoria since October,24
NA,1992 across all business sectors-from manu-,24
NA,facturing and processing to services ranging,24
NA,in size from a large plant or factory to the,24
NA,small comer shop. Thirty thousand new jobs,24
NA,have been created in small business in Vic-,24
NA,toria since October 1992. There are now close,24
NA,"to 210,000 small businesses in Victoria-",24
NA,"some 96 per cent of all enterprises, employing",24
NA,"760,000 Victorians and making up over 50",24
NA,per cent of the private sector work force.,24
NA,The Victorian government is continuing its,24
NA,program of cutting red tape for small busi-,24
NA,ness-something the federal government,24
NA,could well take as an example. Some 450,24
NA,regulations were repealed or sunsetted in,24
NA,"1993, while the rate of new regulation making",24
NA,is at its lowest level since the 1960s. Small,24
NA,"Business Victoria handles around 70,000",24
NA,"inquiries a year, and it is focused on facilitasmall",24
NA,ting service delivery to ensure optimal service,24
NA,to small business operators throughout Vic-,24
NA,toria.,24
NA,An important point that needs to be made,24
NA,is that the Yellow Pages small business health,24
NA,index published in May of this year showed,24
NA,overwhelming support by small business for,24
NA,the Kennett government-a point that the,24
NA,honourable member for MCEwen and the,24
NA,honourable member for Dunkley constantly,24
NA,miss. Sixty-five per cent of small businesses,24
NA,believe that the coalition can best look after,24
NA,their interests; only five per cent believe the,24
NA,ALP would do the right job for small busi-,24
NA,"ness. In Victoria, the coalition is ranked ahead",24
NA,of the ALP on all factors-including handling,24
NA,"the state economy overall, 80 per cent; reduc-",24
NA,"ing unemployment, 61 per cent; minimising",24
NA,"strikes, 43 per cent; workplace reform, 73 per",24
NA,"cent; reducing taxes and charges, 42 per cent",24
NA,"and reducing red tape, 40 per cent.",24
NA,The Yellow Pages survey went on to show,24
NA,that nearly six out of 10 of the small busines-,24
NA,ses surveyed believe the federal Labor,24
NA,government's economic policies work against,24
NA,the interests of small business. Got that?,24
NA,"Federal government policies, the policies this",24
NA,mob over there do not want you to know,24
NA,"about, work against the interests of small",24
NA,"business. This includes taxes, bureaucracy,",24
NA,"lack of incentives, lack of understanding of",24
NA,"the needs of small business, industrial rela-",24
NA,tions policies including unfair dismissal,24
NA,"policies, government charges and superannua-",24
NA,tion policies.,24
NA,According to the latest Yellow Pages survey,24
NA,"released at the end of August, Victorian-and",24
NA,South Australian-small businesses lead the,24
NA,nation in confidence about their prospects for,24
NA,the next 12 months. The index found that a,24
NA,net 52 per cent of Victorian small business,24
NA,proprietors were confident about their per-,24
NA,formance in the next 12 months; that expecta-,24
NA,"tions for sales, employment and profitability",24
NA,"growth for the current quarter have improved,",24
NA,and that perceptions of the current state of the,24
NA,"national economy have, on the other hand,",24
NA,slumped dramatically.,24
NA,"An article on 15 November in, I believe,",24
NA,"the Sydney Morning Herald, talked about",24
NA,to medium sized business enterprises,24
NA,with respect to federal government purchasing,24
NA,policy. I note the article by Nina Field says:,24
NA,Australia's dynamic small to medium-sized enter-,24
NA,prises are still confronted by major hurdles when,24
NA,"selling to the $30 billion government market,",24
NA,according to a study to be released today by the,24
NA,"Federal Minister for Administrative Services, Mr",24
NA,Walker.,24
NA,Mr Walker essentially says that the govern-,25
NA,ment's reforms and purchasing policy still,25
NA,have not got around to doing the job for small,25
NA,business. We brought down this report some,25
NA,"18 months ago, and we made major recom-",25
NA,mendations in this House of Representatives,25
NA,that the government should do something,25
NA,"about controlling its 30,000 employees who",25
NA,place orders for government business-at least,25
NA,$10 million worth of purchasing by the,25
NA,"federal government. Something like 13,000",25
NA,government credit cards float around all over,25
NA,"the place, and we expect small and medium",25
NA,sized businesses to try to get their fair share,25
NA,of government business. It does not work. It,25
NA,is not happening.,25
NA,The study found that locating the right,25
NA,buyer for goods and services was the single,25
NA,most important barrier to almost one-fifth of,25
NA,all small and medium sized business enter-,25
NA,prises. The main reason they had difficulty,25
NA,finding government buyers was generally that,25
NA,they had very few sales staff who could,25
NA,understand that small and medium sized busi-,25
NA,"nesses cannot afford a lot of overheads,",25
NA,cannot afford the marketing spent by the,25
NA,direct sales people.,25
NA,What does the government do to make it,25
NA,"easier? It has 30,000 individuals who can",25
NA,place purchase orders. I might add that these,25
NA,"30,000 individuals do not pay much attention",25
NA,"to common use contracts, either. In recent",25
NA,times I have had personal experience where,25
NA,the government signs a common use contract,25
NA,"at a price, and then the buyers go out to try",25
NA,to knock down the individual supplier still,25
NA,"further, destroying the whole concept of the",25
NA,system.,25
NA,The fact is that Melbourne in Victoria is a,25
NA,true gateway to Australia. It is the home of,25
NA,manufacturing industry. My electorate of La,25
NA,Trobe has particularly good examples of high,25
NA,tech industries dealing with high tech elec-,25
NA,tronics and communications. (Time expired),25
Mr OCONNOR ,Corio) (1.40 p.m.)-I,25
NA,congratulate the member for MCEwen ( Mr,25
NA,Cleeland) for the motion before the House. As,25
NA,a member representing a rural and provincial,25
NA,"area, he fully understands the impact that",25
NA,Kennett's bush recession is having on his,25
NA,constituents.,25
NA,"But, Mr Deputy Speaker, let me say the",25
NA,damage is not confined to the electors of,25
NA,MCEwen. In Geelong the city has been se-,25
NA,verely hit by the Kennett government's,25
NA,regressive policies. While small and medium,25
NA,businesses bleed with gambling revenues,25
NA,syphoning off money from the income stream,25
NA,"in the city, Jeff Kennett has lined the pockets",25
NA,of his Liberal mates in Melbourne with,25
NA,obscene concessions to the Crown Casino.,25
NA,The Kennett government has destroyed over,25
NA,"1,000 public sector jobs in Geelong. That is",25
NA,equivalent to an enterprise as large as,25
NA,"Geelong's second largest employer, Godfrey",25
NA,Hirst. The result of those cutbacks has been,25
NA,that not only the quality services to Geelong,25
NA,"residents in health, education, community",25
NA,"services and transport have all declined but,",25
NA,"in addition to that, some $30 million to $40",25
NA,million has been sucked out of Geelong's,25
NA,income stream in wages-a major part of,25
NA,which would have been spent in small and,25
NA,medium private businesses in Geelong.,25
NA,This is not the only area where the residents,25
NA,of Geelong have been hit. For too long,25
NA,Geelong residents were denied their democrat-,25
NA,ic right to elect their local government repre-,25
NA,"sentatives by the Kennett government, ob-",25
NA,sessed with centralising power in Spring,25
NA,"Street. All over Victoria, in the seats of",25
NA,"MCMillan, Ballarat, Bendigo, MCEwen and",25
NA,"Dunkley, councils have been abolished and",25
NA,municipalities are currently being adminis-,25
NA,tered by Kennett's commissars-people who,25
NA,owe their loyalty to their political masters in,25
NA,Spring Street and certainly not to the people,25
NA,"of their municipalities, nor the people of",25
NA,Victoria. Victoria in 1995 is somewhat remi-,25
NA,"niscent of Stalin's Russia in the 1950s, with",25
NA,a whole strata of local government abolished,25
NA,and highjacked and now controlled by Spring,25
NA,Street puppet masters.,25
NA,The workers of Geelong have also been hit,25
NA,by this state government. They remember Jeff,25
NA,Kennett's pre-election promise that they,25
NA,would be no worse off under the industrial,25
NA,relations policy of his government. They,25
NA,remember the awful betrayal as they were,25
NA,given the option of the contract or the sack by,25
NA,Kennett. They remember the example of the,25
NA,librarian who had her wages cut by over,25
NA,"$10,000 by the policies of this state govern-",26
NA,ment. And they fled in droves to the protec-,26
NA,tion of the federal industrial award system,26
NA,provided by Paul Keating and this Labor,26
NA,government. They know that John Howard,26
NA,and the federal coalition have always support-,26
NA,ed Kennett's regressive labour market poli-,26
NA,cies. They remember Jeff Kennett's recent,26
NA,pronouncement that with the election of a,26
NA,Howard government workers in Geelong,26
NA,would have nowhere else to go.,26
NA,It is not only the fact that Jeff Kennett has,26
NA,attempted to cut their wages and conditions.,26
NA,It is not only the fact that their businesses,26
NA,have suffered with the proliferation of gam-,26
NA,"bling. It is not only the fact that their schools,",26
NA,kids and hospitals have been cut back while,26
NA,Jeff Kennett has lined the pockets of his,26
NA,Liberal mates in Melbourne. It is the fact that,26
NA,the Kennett government has waged an unprin-,26
NA,cipled war against the individual democratic,26
NA,rights of the citizens of the state. It is this,26
NA,that really has made decent Liberals sick to,26
NA,their stomachs. Kennett has: sacked local,26
NA,"councils, installed unelected commissioners",26
NA,and delayed local government elections;,26
NA,attacked the independence of the Victorian,26
NA,judiciary; removed the legal right of appeal of,26
NA,citizens in over 100 pieces of legislation;,26
NA,removed their planning rights; restricted,26
NA,access to the Administrative Appeals Tribu-,26
NA,nal; and more.,26
NA,It is this unprincipled attack on the legal,26
NA,rights of individual Victorians which has,26
NA,shamed decent Liberals who expected more,26
NA,"from their state government. Indeed, we",26
NA,expect more from the Liberal member for La,26
NA,"Trobe ( Mr Charles), the member for Isaacs",26
NA,( Mr Atkinson) and the member for Bendigo,26
NA,( Mr Reid) in this House today and in this,26
NA,debate. The honourable member for La Trobe,26
NA,defends the Kennett government as the cham-,26
NA,pion of small business. Who has lowered the,26
NA,business taxes in this country? Who has got,26
NA,the inflation rate under two per cent? Who,26
NA,has promoted growth to the extent of four per,26
NA,cent a year? Who has got interest rates to,26
NA,manageable levels? Who has reduced indus-,26
NA,trial disputation to the lowest level in 40,26
NA,years? A federal Labor government! All of,26
NA,those elements have assisted small and medi-,26
NA,um businesses in Geelong. (Time expired),26
Mr REID ,Bendigo) (1.45 p.m.)-In,26
NA,"political language, this motion is known as a",26
NA,boomerang motion. The member for MCEwen,26
NA,"( Mr Cleeland) has thrown the boomerang out,",26
NA,"it has gone around, and it is going to come",26
NA,back and smack him right behind the ear.,26
NA,Fancy having the gall and the hypocrisy to,26
NA,accuse Victoria of causing the problems of,26
NA,Australian small business and the rural sector.,26
NA,How gross can you be?,26
NA,The Australian Labor Party has had high,26
NA,"taxing governments, like the Keating govern-",26
NA,ment. It has had high interest rate govern-,26
NA,"ments, like the Keating government. Let me",26
NA,go back a few years to when interest rates,26
NA,were eight and nine per cent. What did this,26
NA,government do? It pushed the interest rates,26
NA,from eight and nine per cent right up to 21,26
NA,and 23 per cent. The Keating government-,26
NA,through the 'recession we had to have'-,26
NA,fact bankrupted hundreds and hundreds. The Prime,26
NA,Minister ( Mr Keating) forced up interest rates,26
NA,and bankrupted hundreds and hundreds of,26
NA,small businesses in this country.,26
NA,The member for Corio ( Mr O'Connor) and,26
NA,the member for MCEwen have the gall to get,26
NA,up here and say that this was caused by the,26
NA,Victorian state government-a government,26
NA,which had to take over from the Cain-Kirner,26
NA,"Labor governments, the Keating government's",26
NA,"Labor mates, which had incurred debts and",26
NA,"liabilities of $42,000 million in Victoria.",26
NA,What a disgrace! You should be ashamed to,26
NA,even be in this House. Fancy bringing for-,26
NA,ward a motion like this-'devastation caused,26
NA,to small business and rural communities'.,26
NA,What did you care when my rural com-,26
NA,munity in Bendigo in central Victoria had the,26
NA,second worst drought in our history? There,26
NA,was not one dollar of drought relief from the,26
NA,"federal government-not one cent, nothing.",26
NA,Yet you have the gall to get up and say that,26
NA,you are supporting small business and rural,26
NA,communities.,26
NA,Did the member for MCEwen know that his,26
NA,policies bankrupted hundreds of people in,26
NA,electorates like mine when interest rates went,26
NA,from nine per cent to 21 and 23 per cent?,26
NA,You acknowledged that we had a drought,26
NA,which was the second worst in our history,27
NA,and that our rural people are suffering. Of,27
NA,course they suffered. But you did nothing.,27
NA,You did not lift one finger-not one-to help,27
NA,those people. They remember it and they will,27
NA,continue to remember it.,27
NA,I am delighted by the offer of the member,27
NA,for MCEwen to circulate my speech in his,27
NA,electorate. I would love you to do it. Will you,27
NA,promise me that you will? No. He is shaking,27
NA,his head. It is a typical Labor stunt-make the,27
NA,"offer and then get rid of it, like the l-a-w law",27
NA,tax cuts. What ever happened to those tax,27
NA,cuts? You lied to the Australian people. You,27
NA,said the tax cuts were legislated and that,27
NA,every small business person in the community,27
NA,would get tax cuts. What did you do? As,27
NA,"soon as you got back into government, you",27
NA,got rid of them. You did not honour your,27
NA,promise. You lied.,27
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Nehl)-,27
NA,"Actually, the chair did not lie. You might",27
NA,address your remarks through the chair.,27
Mr REID,"Certainly, Mr Deputy Speaker.",27
NA,Fancy government members having the gall,27
NA,to come into this House with a motion like,27
NA,this. I have indicated to you the impact that,27
NA,that had on small business people in my,27
NA,community. They will never forget what the,27
NA,Labor Party has done to them.,27
NA,Most farmers operate as small business,27
NA,people. They are the true small business,27
NA,people. They operate as a partnership or as a,27
NA,family company and try to run their farms.,27
NA,They are really the people who are suffering,27
NA,under the policies of the Keating government.,27
NA,It is an absolute disgrace that this member has,27
NA,brought this motion before the House and is,27
NA,trying to palm off the responsibility for this,27
NA,"onto the state government in Victoria, which",27
NA,is trying to repair the damage of an incurred,27
NA,"debt and liability of $42,000 million, incurred",27
NA,by your Labor mates from Victoria-the,27
NA,Cain-Kirner governments.,27
NA,Does the member for Corio not understand,27
NA,what happened with the Pyramid Building,27
NA,"Society, not understand the debt that was",27
NA,incurred from it and what the government,27
NA,did-selling the State Bank? (Time expired),27
Mr CHYNOWETH ,Dunkley) (1.50,27
NA,p.m.)-In possibly the last speech by the,27
NA,member for Bendigo ( Mr Reid) he has been,27
NA,justifying the standard of the Kennett govern-,27
NA,ment. He has been saying that we made an,27
NA,"offer, then we withdrew it, and it was a lie.",27
NA,Let me show you who the liar is: the liar is,27
NA,Jeffrey 'Glib' Kennett from Victoria. In a,27
NA,pamphlet that he distributed throughout my,27
NA,electorate and all over Victoria back in 1992,27
NA,"before the last election, he stated:",27
NA,The Coalition New Jobs Initiative will generate,27
NA,"between 30,000 and 40,000 new jobs for Victorians",27
NA,by giving employers the incentive to take on new,27
NA,employees.,27
NA,Private sector employers-,27
NA,exactly who we are talking about-,27
NA,who take on new employees over and above their,27
NA,Victorian workforce numbers as at 30 June 1992,27
NA,"will receive a cash payment of up to $2,500 per",27
NA,annum for every additional employee.,27
NA,Did we see one dollar? Not a dollar. It is a,27
NA,direct lie by Jeffrey 'Glib' Kennett. He drags,27
NA,us Victorians down all the time he is there.,27
NA,"Just in last Sunday's Age, this article headed",27
NA,'Jobs lag in private sector' states:,27
NA,Private enterprise has failed to compensate for,27
NA,"massive Public Service job losses in Victoria,",27
NA,figures released by the Australian Bureau of,27
NA,Statistics last week show.,27
NA,"The figures show that almost 68,000 Public",27
NA,Service jobs were lost during the first three years,27
NA,"of the Kennett Government. More than 8,000 of",27
NA,those were not absorbed by the private sector.,27
NA,Kennett has sacked huge numbers of people.,27
NA,He has destroyed the state government in our,27
NA,state. What has happened to those people?,27
NA,They have all got their payouts; they have,27
NA,increased the debt for Victoria; and they are,27
NA,all out spending it. But in a couple of years,27
NA,time what will happen will be that many of,27
NA,them will be asking for Commonwealth hand-,27
NA,outs. Why? Because of Jeff Kennett's mad-,27
NA,ness in trying to cut down state government,27
NA,services. There has hardly been a job created,27
NA,down in Victoria by Jeffrey 'Glib' Kennett.,27
NA,Let me give you an example of what,27
NA,happened on the peninsula. The Flinders Shire,27
NA,Council has sacked 180 people and the,27
NA,Frankston council has sacked-as far as I can,27
NA,"find out, because they are very secretive-",27
NA,"around 50 people. If you add that together,",27
NA,that makes 200-odd people gone on the,28
NA,policies of Jeffrey 'Glib' Kennett. Why?,28
NA,Because of some mad rationalism idea that he,28
NA,has got from Nazi Germany or somewhere.,28
NA,He has destroyed jobs in our area.,28
Mr REID ," Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point",28
NA,of order: I think the reference that the honour-,28
NA,able member made should be withdrawn. I,28
NA,think that is quite inappropriate. I certainly,28
NA,take offence to it.,28
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Nehl)-I,28
NA,would be obliged if you would withdraw the,28
NA,reference to Nazis.,28
Mr CHYNOWETH,I was just reporting,28
NA,what has been said in the Herald-Sun in an,28
NA,article headed 'City churches hit Nazi state'.,28
NA,They have said that. I am quite entitled to say,28
NA,that in this House.,28
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,There is no,28
NA,point of order.,28
Mr CHYNOWETH,The article states:,28
NA,Democracy in Victoria is threatened by the,28
NA,"tyrannical forces which shaped Nazi Germany,",28
NA,according to a major discussion paper by some of,28
NA,Melbourne's church leaders.,28
NA,"The churches included the Baptist Church, the",28
NA,"Wesley Uniting Church, St Francis, St",28
NA,Augustine's and the Salvation Army City,28
NA,Corps. Do you reckon they are all wrong just,28
NA,because I say it? It is not wrong. What Ken-,28
NA,nett has done is try to turn Victoria into Nazi,28
NA,Germany. He has deliberately run down,28
NA,"democracy, as the member for Corio ( Mr",28
NA,O'Connor) mentioned. Democratic council,28
NA,elections are not held any more. I have three,28
NA,Liberal Party appointed commissioners in my,28
NA,electorate-,28
NA,Mr Cleeland-Commissars!,28
Mr CHYNOWETH,"Commissars, all",28
NA,right. They are not past members of the,28
NA,Liberal Party; they are present members of the,28
NA,Liberal Party. One of them actually chaired a,28
NA,"local Liberal election down there. Therefore,",28
NA,they are deciding what is going to happen in,28
NA,Frankston. They are sacking people down,28
NA,there; they are cutting services; and they are,28
NA,putting up service charges all the way around.,28
NA,"They give us a measly $2.50 a week and say,",28
NA,"'Good on you, Bob, we've cut your rates",28
NA,down 20 per cent.' What they are doing is,28
NA,wrong.,28
NA,What I shall be doing all the rest of my,28
NA,time that I am ever in parliament is making,28
NA,certain that I highlight what Kennett is doing,28
NA,to destroy the Victorian economy. He is,28
NA,destroying democracy there and he is doing,28
NA,it by stealth all the time. His mates are looked,28
NA,after. If you have got a job or if you own a,28
NA,"casino, no problem; if you run a building",28
NA,contracting firm and you want to get a few,28
NA,"jobs off the council, no problem. But if you",28
NA,are a worker for the council looking after,28
NA,"parks and gardens, out you go; if you are a",28
NA,"worker in the local child-care centre, out you",28
NA,go. They are the sorts of things that are,28
NA,happening down in Victoria. That is what this,28
NA,motion is all about. (Time expired),28
Mr ATKINSON ,Isaacs) (1.55 p.m.)-This,28
NA,has been a totally political and cynical exer-,28
NA,cise by the member for MCEwen ( Mr,28
NA,Cleeland) and his Labor government mates.,28
NA,They come in here and talk about privat-,28
NA,same isation and the bad things that happen. Is,28
NA,there anyone of those four over there who,28
NA,did not vote for the Commonwealth Bank,28
NA,being privatised? Are there any hands coming,28
NA,up over there from those who did not vote for,28
NA,the bank to be privatised?,28
NA,Would you like me to move to the Qantas,28
NA,sale? Would anyone over there like to stand,28
NA,up and say that they did not support the sale,28
NA,of Qantas? Is there anyone over there who,28
NA,will stand up and say that they did not sup-,28
NA,port the sell-off of the airports of this coun-,28
NA,try? Not one of you! You stand up in this,28
NA,House and say that the Kennett economic,28
NA,rationalist government is doing all the wrong,28
NA,things. You stand up and talk but you do not,28
NA,think anyone on this side of the House will,28
NA,answer you. I can tell you that there are,28
NA,plenty of people on this side who will answer,28
NA,you.,28
NA,Talk about devastation! Talk about fuel,28
NA,increases! What about the fuel taxes that this,28
NA,government has increased in this term? What,28
NA,about the increases in sales tax? We had $9.3,28
NA,billion in sales tax before the last election and,28
NA,now Australians are paying $14 billion. On,28
NA,average it means that a family consisting of,28
NA,"a mother, a father and two children are paying",28
NA,$60 a week in sales tax. Those opposite have,29
NA,the gall to stand up in this place and talk,29
NA,about the devastation being created by Jeffrey,29
NA,Kennett!,29
NA,The member for MCEwen spoke about the,29
NA,reduction in numbers in the Public Service in,29
NA,Victoria. If we do not start to reduce the,29
NA,"numbers in the Public Service, and reduce the",29
NA,"cost to the average Victorian, we will have",29
NA,problems with the taxes that have to be,29
NA,collected. That is the problem facing the,29
NA,federal government in this country. We have,29
NA,difficulty returning to a balanced budget,29
NA,because those opposite are not prepared to,29
NA,look at the adjustments that are necessary to,29
NA,get the results that this country needs.,29
NA,You talk about Victoria. Go back to the,29
NA,Cain-Kirner era. Who was selling off the,29
NA,trams and trains and leasing them back from,29
NA,the Japanese? It was not Jeffrey Kennett: it,29
NA,was the Cain-Kirner administration. Mr,29
NA,Kennett came to government with a $42,29
NA,billion debt created by your Labor mates.,29
NA,How would you expect him to resolve the,29
NA,problem other than by inflicting some hard-,29
NA,ship on the people? Do you think the people,29
NA,in Victoria are not going to remember what,29
NA,the Cain-Kirner administrations did? Of,29
NA,course they are going to remember!,29
NA,Look at the process we are going through,29
NA,at the moment with employment. You talk,29
NA,about the creation of jobs. Your industrial,29
NA,laws have a hell of a lot to answer for. Look,29
NA,at the wrongful dismissal law. Many people,29
NA,are employing workers on overtime because,29
NA,"they say, 'I really don't want to put on any-",29
NA,body else because I may have a problem if I,29
NA,need to get rid of them in the future.' This,29
NA,problem has been caused by the federal,29
NA,government's wrongful dismissal laws.,29
NA,Today's motion is absolutely hypocritical.,29
NA,I believe that the people of Australia will,29
NA,recognise that. This country has a foreign debt,29
NA,of $180 billion-plus. When this government,29
NA,came to office the foreign debt was $23,29
NA,billion. We saw problems like this in Victoria,29
NA,under the Cain-Kirner administrations. These,29
NA,things have to be rectified if we are to turn,29
NA,this country around. It is not simply a prob-,29
NA,lem for state governments.,29
NA,You have a philosophical belief in the old,29
NA,process of filling up the Public Service and,29
NA,letting a few pay for the system. It eventually,29
NA,gets to the stage where you cannot finance,29
NA,your business and you go out the back door.,29
NA,You find that someone from overseas is,29
NA,selling goods in opposition to you. This is the,29
NA,philosophy that is destroying this country. The,29
NA,sooner the people of this country have the,29
NA,"opportunity to vote in a federal election, the",29
NA,sooner we will be able to get rid of those on,29
NA,the other side of this House.,29
NA,"If you think I am angry about this, Mr",29
NA,"Deputy Speaker, I am. The nerve of these",29
NA,"people, coming into this House with a motion",29
NA,criticising a government that is turning around,29
NA,a previously bankrupt state. It is outrageous.,29
NA,When we get to the next election I hope that,29
NA,the people of Australia will recognise this and,29
NA,treat these people opposite with the same sort,29
NA,of contempt as I do. (Time expired),29
Mr CUNNINGHAM ,MCMillan) (2.00,29
NA,p.m.)-We have just heard from two members,29
NA,"of the opposition who I think, particularly",29
NA,"after listening to their speeches today, will not",29
NA,be here after the next election. The seat of,29
NA,Bendigo and the seat of Isaacs are two seats,29
NA,that certainly will fall to the Labor Party at,29
NA,the next election. They will fall to the Labor,29
NA,Party not because of privatisation or because,29
NA,of the debate about corporatisation but be-,29
NA,cause of the policies that the Kennett govern-,29
NA,ment has delivered and what those policies,29
NA,"are doing to small business people, employ-",29
NA,"ees, country towns and the general atmos-",29
NA,phere in Victoria today.,29
NA,My two parliamentary colleagues on the,29
NA,opposite side of the chamber-the member for,29
NA,Bendigo ( Mr Reid) and the member for Isaacs,29
NA,( Mr Atkinson)-know that. They know they,29
NA,"are in trouble because of the Kennett policies,",29
NA,and they are probably doing a little behind the,29
NA,scenes to help their causes. I was hoping that,29
NA,in this debate today we would hear them,29
NA,stand up for their electorates and defend their,29
NA,electorates against some of the policies of this,29
NA,"Kennett government, policies which, behind",29
NA,"the scenes, they definitely do not agree with.",29
NA,The reason they do not agree with these,29
NA,policies is that they are destroying Victoria.,29
NA,The Kennett government has no social,30
NA,policy at all. It has no heart. It has a rational,30
NA,economic policy and that is as far as it goes.,30
NA,The Kennett government tells the people of,30
NA,Victoria that everything will be fine. Maggie,30
NA,"Thatcher was in town a couple of days ago,",30
NA,and she was saying that Thatcherism was,30
NA,alive and well in Victoria. What would,30
NA,"Jeffrey say about that? He would say, 'No,",30
NA,don't tag me to Thatcherism; that is not what,30
NA,we are on about' -as if it were not true.,30
NA,Go to any part of rural Victoria and see if,30
NA,the Kennett government is not the most city,30
NA,based government that has ever been elected,30
NA,to parliament in Australia. Not one National,30
NA,Party member in this parliament is prepared,30
NA,to stand up and defend the Kennett govern-,30
NA,ment. What about the so-called coalition,30
NA,between the Liberal and National parties? The,30
NA,"National Party is mute because, firstly, they",30
NA,do not have the numbers-which means they,30
NA,"have no power-and, secondly, they are",30
NA,absolutely devastated by what the Kennett,30
NA,government is doing to their constituency,30
NA,right across Victoria. They have put the,30
NA,commissioners in there.,30
NA,Mr Chynoweth-Commissars.,30
Mr CUNNINGHAM,The commissars.,30
NA,The Kennett government are making deci-,30
NA,"sions, but there is no democracy. Straight out,",30
NA,they will cut the rates-with no assessment of,30
NA,"whether that is necessary--cut the services,",30
NA,sell the park-,30
NA,Mr Cleeland-Cut the jobs.,30
Mr CUNNINGHAM,They will cut the,30
NA,"jobs, destroy the total economy in the area,",30
NA,bring in the poker machines and take more,30
NA,money out. The result from all of that is that,30
NA,there is no money in the community and the,30
NA,economy keeps on going down.,30
NA,There is not a small country town in Vic-,30
NA,toria today that is not bleeding. If we had,30
NA,people moving to the bigger cities and the,30
NA,"bigger towns in the past, we have a mass",30
NA,exodus right now. People are flooding out of,30
NA,the smaller towns. Their first choice is per-,30
NA,"haps the Sheppartons or the Bendigos, but",30
NA,there is no solution there.,30
NA,All the money is being spent in the city-,30
NA,"for example, money is being spent on the",30
NA,casino. Millions and millions of dollars are,30
NA,being spent in Melbourne. The development,30
NA,of Melbourne is the only thing that the Ken-,30
NA,nett government has in the way of policies.,30
NA,When we go out to the country regions of,30
NA,"Australia, we find that they are being abso-",30
NA,lutely devastated by this government.,30
NA,What about the health area? What is hap-,30
NA,pening in our public hospitals? Come 5,30
NA,"o'clock, the public hospitals close down in",30
NA,Rosebud and the Latrobe Valley and we are,30
NA,expected to have a consortium of private doc-,30
NA,"tors who will agree to come on call, but even",30
NA,they are out on strike. They are refusing to,30
NA,work for this Kennett government because of,30
NA,what Jeff Kennett is actually doing in the,30
NA,policy area.,30
NA,What about mental health? We have people,30
NA,in my electorate at the moment who are living,30
NA,in flats and are dependent upon public ser-,30
NA,vants coming and assisting them after 5,30
NA,o'clock on a Friday. But the Kennett govern-,30
NA,ment is so ideologically pure when it comes,30
NA,to overtime and penalty rates that it will not,30
NA,provide enough money to have people assist,30
NA,our mentally disabled people. These mentalIy,30
NA,disabled people have to wait until Monday,30
NA,morning-not because there are no people,30
NA,available to work but because the ideological,30
NA,view of the Kennett government and the,30
NA,Liberal Party is that you cannot pay penalty,30
NA,"rates. Their view is, 'We will do a CRA. We",30
NA,will break that union. We wiIl break that,30
NA,proposal so we can get them on to hourly,30
NA,rates.',30
NA,But who is suffering? The people of Vic-,30
NA,toria are suffering. Families in my electorate,30
NA,"are suffering, because their loved ones have",30
NA,nobody there to look after them. There are,30
NA,some disgusting cases of neglect caused by,30
NA,"the Victorian government, and that neglect is",30
NA,based upon that government's ideological,30
NA,view and nothing else. (Time expired),30
Mr BEALE ,Bruce) (2.05 p.m.)-Any,30
NA,devastation caused to small business and rural,30
NA,communities in Victoria was caused by the,30
NA,Cain and Kirner governments and not by the,30
NA,"Kennett government, which by any standards",30
NA,"has been outstanding, given the shocking",30
NA,mess it inherited. The Kennett-MCNamara-,30
NA,Stockdale government inherited the worst,30
NA,"mess in Australia's federal history, worse than",31
NA,the mess left by the discredited Lawrence,31
NA,"Labor government in Western Australia,",31
NA,worse than WA Inc. and worse than the mess,31
NA,left by the discredited Labor government in,31
NA,South Australia.,31
NA,The shocking mismanagement by Cain and,31
NA,Kirner left Victoria in a black hole and the,31
NA,Kennett government has been fixing the place,31
NA,"up. Cain and Kirner were selling off assets,",31
NA,not to reduce debt but to pay recurrent ex-,31
NA,"penses, selling assets to invest in the most",31
NA,dubious of projects and selling assets to pay,31
NA,their mates in high positions. Cain and Kirner,31
NA,were running around telling Tricontinental,31
NA,and the State Bank to invest in any thing-,31
NA,"give the money away, lend to anything and on",31
NA,anything. That is what Cain and Kirner were,31
NA,doing. They were like the Marx brothers on,31
NA,"the train, smashing up the carriages and seats",31
NA,and furniture to feed the locomotive of Vic-,31
NA,toria as it sped on to ruin.,31
NA,Who was one of the leading faction figures,31
NA,and an adviser to the Cain and Kirner govern-,31
NA,ments?-none other than the member for,31
NA,MCEwen ( Mr Cleeland). We now have Jeff,31
NA,Kennett cleaning up the mess created by these,31
NA,governments and their adviser Peter Cleeland,31
NA,is smashing up the seats and furniture to feed,31
NA,the boiler. The electors of MCEwen should,31
NA,know about their current member. They,31
NA,should know that he was an adviser to Cain,31
NA,and Kirner and an adviser to the greatest,31
NA,incompetent of them all-David White. David,31
NA,White is lucky he is not the subject of a royal,31
NA,commission. Jeff Kennett and Alan Stockdale,31
NA,have exposed his incompetence. He cost the,31
NA,Victorian taxpayers $6 billion in his failed,31
NA,deals. The Gas and Fuel Corporation building,31
NA,was a disaster. So was the deal David White,31
NA,did with the State Electricity Commission of,31
NA,Victoria and so was the deal he did with,31
NA,Alcoa-and all the time advised by the,31
NA,"member for MCEwen, Peter Cleeland.",31
NA,It is a criminal offence for a director of a,31
NA,public company to make false and misleading,31
NA,statements and it is a criminal offence for a,31
NA,director to fail to exercise reasonable skill and,31
NA,care in the exercise of his duties. There is no,31
NA,way that David White exercised reasonable,31
NA,skill and care in the exercise of his duties. If,31
NA,he had been a director of a public company,31
NA,he would have been charged by the Australian,31
NA,Securities Commission and he would now be,31
NA,in gaol. He would be in gaol for creating the,31
NA,mess that he left Victoria in. He was advised,31
NA,by the member for MCEwen and it is this,31
NA,mess that the Kennett government is now,31
NA,cleaning up.,31
NA,David White cost the Victorian taxpayers,31
NA,$6 billion. This motion should not be about,31
NA,the Kennett government. It should be about,31
NA,the Cain and Kirner governments. Cain and,31
NA,Kirner and David White cost the Victorian,31
NA,taxpayers $40 billion. If White had been a,31
NA,"public company director, he would now be in",31
NA,gaol. Let the member for MCEwen note this,31
NA,"carefully. The people he advised-Cain,",31
NA,Kirner and David White-cost the Victorian,31
NA,"taxpayers $40 billion. That is $50,000 for",31
NA,every family in his electorate. The voters in,31
NA,MCEwen need to know that their member and,31
NA,his state factional cronies cost every family in,31
NA,"his electorate $50,000.",31
NA,What is the Kennett government doing? It,31
NA,is cleaning up the disaster left by the Cain,31
NA,and Kirner governments and by Minister,31
NA,White. These people bear the badge of gross,31
NA,incompetence around their necks like a chain,31
NA,of shame while the Kennett government,31
NA,deserves the thanks of all Victorians for the,31
NA,job it is doing.,31
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Les,31
NA,Scott)-Order! The time for this debate has,31
NA,expired. The debate is adjourned and the,31
NA,resumption of the debate will be made an,31
NA,order of the day for the next sitting Monday.,31
Mr CLEELAND ,MCEwen)- Mr Deputy,31
NA,"Speaker, I wish to make a personal explan-",31
NA,ation.,31
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Does the,31
NA,honourable member claim to have been,31
NA,misrepresented?,31
Mr CLEELAND,I do indeed.,31
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Please proceed.,31
Mr CLEELAND,The honourable member,31
NA,for Bruce ( Mr Beale) made allegations that I,31
NA,had been employed as an adviser to the,31
NA,former member-,31
NA,Mr Beale---I didn't say you were em-,32
NA,ployed. I said you advised him.,32
Mr CLEELAND,Or was an adviser. I,32
NA,have never been an adviser and I have never,32
NA,been employed by any state member of the,32
NA,Victorian parliament. It is an outrageous,32

NA,national economy;,32
NA,(2) realises the need for more road funding from,32

NA,"One of my constituents, a man called Kevin",32
NA,"Moran, died on Friday, 12 May 1995. Kevin",32
NA,was a good man and a family man. I just,32
NA,want to quote briefly from a letter written by,32
NA,"his widow two days later, on 14 May. It",32
NA,reads:,32
NA,"After losing one son to this road, we were",32
NA,"stunned. Then when Roberts bus was hit by a semi,",32
NA,"we were shattered, but honestly ... I don't know",32
NA,"what I am now-I can't feel, I can't think, I don't",32
NA,"want to live, my family have lost their Dad. I have",32
NA,"lost my best friend, my mate of 35 years, and the",32
NA,only person I have ever loved-all because no-one,32
NA,will make a decision.,32
NA,"I have pleaded, I have begged, I have prayed, I",32
NA,have done everything possible to get this road,32
NA,"underway ... but it has obviously been to no avail,",32
NA,"and now I have to suffer a life of solitude, of",32
NA,"grieving, of aching loneliness ... Something has",32
NA,got to be done . . . before someone else is killed-,32
NA,"surely two, and almost three, from one family is",32
NA,enough.,32
NA,I grieve for Mrs Moran and her family. This,32
NA,is what we are talking about when we talk,32
NA,about the Pacific Highway. We are talking,32
NA,"about death, mayhem, slaughter, grief and an",32
NA,enormous cost to the society of Australia; not,32
NA,"just in pain and suffering, but in money. The",32
NA,cost-benefit ratio of building a new Pacific,32
NA,Highway makes it far cheaper to build a new,32
NA,highway than to pay for the deaths and the,32
NA,suffering. I am reminded that very soon-22,32
NA,December-we have the anniversary of the,32
NA,Clybucca bus smash in my electorate where,32
NA,35 people died. It was Australia's worst,32
NA,disaster. I see the member for Page ( Mr Harry,32
NA,Woods) sitting in the chamber. A couple of,32
NA,"months before that smash, in his electorate",32
NA,"near the little village of Cowper, 20 people",32
NA,"died on a bus. In actual fact, the number of",32
NA,people who have died on the Pacific Highway,32
NA,ROADS between 1985 and 1994 is 766. There were,32
NA,"10,000 casualties-10,000 smashed, maimed",32
NA,and battered bodies. It is not good enough.,32
NA,"As we approach Christmas 1995, let's pray",32
NA,"that there are no more bus smashes-but,",32
NA,"unfortunately, there will be deaths. I was",32
NA,interested to see the 60 Minutes segment last,32
NA,night on which Richard Carleton spoke with,32
NA,"black Kevin Waller, the former Chief Coroner of",32
NA,"New South Wales, who conducted coronial",32
NA,inquiries into both bus smashes. He was,32
NA,"talking about the federal minister for roads,",32
NA,the Minister for Transport ( Mr Brereton). He,32
NA,said:,32
NA,"Well, Mr Brereton, I would just ask you to serious-",32
NA,ly get down to work to start planning this dual,32
NA,construction and to give the motorists something,32
NA,"that they've deserved, I think, for the past 20 or 25",32
NA,years.,32
NA,Another point made in that program was that,32
NA,a painted line is not good enough for separat-,32
NA,ing traffic. It is absolutely true. We have to,32
NA,"have a four-lane dual carriageway, a divided",32
NA,highway all the way from Hexham to the,32
NA,Queensland border. All the evidence from,32
NA,around Australia and from right around the,32
NA,"world shows, without any doubt, that once",32
NA,you put in a divided highway the number of,32
NA,accidents diminishes and the number of,32
NA,fatalities goes down by as much as 80 per,32
NA,cent. These are not just idle figures. These are,32
NA,the statistics of the RTA and the various other,32
NA,state bodies around Australia and throughout,32
NA,the world. Put in a divided highway and cut,32
NA,out the deaths. That is what we have to do on,32
NA,the Pacific Highway.,32
NA,The highway serves a population of about,32
NA,"500,000. But that is just the local population.",32
NA,"The reality is that, with a traffic level of",32
NA,"37,000 vehicles a day, an enormous number",32
NA,"of people from Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane",32
NA,and Geelong also use the highway. I am not,32
NA,making a plea for the local people of the,32
NA,north coast but for all of Australia. This is,33
NA,one of the major traffic arteries of Australia.,33
NA,It connects the two largest cities in Australia.,33
NA,It serves the fastest growing area of Australia.,33
NA,It is the transportation backbone of the east,33
NA,coast of Australia.,33
NA,There is huge potential along the length of,33
NA,that highway for major industries such as,33
NA,tourism. Getting the right road will assist,33
NA,"everybody. If these industries are to succeed,",33
NA,it will be economically beneficial for the,33
NA,"whole of Australia, not just the people of the",33
NA,north coast. We should not forget that the,33
NA,2000 Olympics are just around the comer.,33
NA,With people travelling from Sydney to the,33
NA,"Gold Coast, the amount of traffic on the",33
NA,highway will increase dramatically.,33
NA,"Unfortunately, the present Labor govern-",33
NA,ment-I am going to be political; I am sure,33
NA,that the member for Page and his colleagues,33
NA,will attack me-has abandoned the Pacific,33
NA,Highway. There is no doubt about that. For a,33
NA,"while, they did the right thing. I will",33
NA,a very brief history of what has happened,33
NA,with the Pacific Highway and the campaign,33
NA,for a new one. Before I was first elected in,33
NA,"1984, I started the campaign for a new Pacific",33
NA,Highway. People said that I was stupid and an,33
NA,idiot. They said that I would never get a,33
NA,lane highway there and that it was pie in the,33
NA,"sky. How wrong they were, because we are",33
NA,going to get it. We have had a little. The,33
NA,reality is that we must get it.,33
NA,"After those unfortunate bus smashes, the",33
NA,people of Australia got right behind the,33
NA,"Pacific Highway. In 1990, I was able to",33
NA,"present something like 50,000 signatures on",33
NA,petitions to this parliament from people right,33
NA,"around Australia. They said, 'Please give the",33
NA,Pacific Highway some priority.' I was able to,33
NA,convince first the National Party of the need,33
NA,for priority funding and then our Liberal,33
NA,"friends. When we went into the 1990 election,",33
NA,"we had a firm coalition policy, in conjunction",33
NA,with the then coalition government of New,33
NA,"South Wales, to provide additional funding.",33
NA,"We did, and it did happen.",33
NA,We had a program that said that the high-,33
NA,way would get an additional $300 million. An,33
NA,amount of $130 million was to come from the,33
NA,federal government and $170 million was to,33
NA,come from the state government. Thank,33
NA,goodness the Labor government took up the,33
NA,challenge. They matched our offer. The reality,33
NA,is that $300 million was spent between 1990,33
NA,and 1993. The few kilometres of divided,33
NA,highway that we now have are a result of that,33
NA,extra $300 million.,33
NA,I praise the member for Charlton ( Mr,33
NA,"Robert Brown), who was the Minister for",33
NA,"Transport, and a darned good one. He put the",33
NA,money into the Pacific Highway. Unfortunate-,33
NA,"ly, he left the ministry, and that was it. It was",33
NA,finished. The black spots program went right,33
NA,out the door. That was the most efficient use,33
NA,of funding that this country has ever seen.,33
NA,People want it back. Labor abolished the,33
NA,black spots program. I am very pleased to say,33
NA,"that, while the details of everything have not",33
NA,been announced and will not be until the,33
NA,"election, the coalition has promised to reintro-",33
NA,duce the black spots program. It is a good,33
NA,"promise. After 1993, no more funding went",33
NA,give you directly to the Pacific Highway.,33
NA,All sorts of organisations on the north coast,33
NA,have created a task force. There is a meeting,33
NA,of it in the next few weeks. We met in Bal-,33
NA,lina about a year ago. We were all very happy,33
NA,"and bipartisan, but nothing happened. I say to",33
NA,four- the member for Page-he will have a chance,33
NA,in a minute to refute this-that he says things,33
NA,"in the electorate but, when he comes down",33
NA,"here, as in the forestry industry debate, he",33
NA,votes on the party line. I challenge the mem-,33
NA,ber for Page to say that he will pressure his,33
NA,"government, going into the next election, to",33
NA,provide priority funding for the Pacific High-,33
NA,way and to reinstate the black spots program.,33
NA,We do not want any more deaths. There have,33
NA,been far too many. I for one have had a,33
NA,gutful of people dying on that highway.,33
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Les,33
NA,Scott)-Is the motion seconded?,33
NA,"Mr Vaile-Yes, I second the motion and",33
NA,reserve my right to speak later.,33
Mr HARRY WOODS ,Page) (2.20 p.m.)-,33
NA,I can only be with the member for Cowper,33
NA,( Mr Nehl) on this subject of the deaths on the,33
NA,"roads, particularly those on the Pacific High-",33
NA,way as he mentioned. Back in 1989 and 1990,33
NA,we had some particularly bad bus crashes,33
NA,resulting in the deaths of many people. I too,33
NA,have known people who have been killed on,34
NA,the Pacific Highway.,34
NA,"My great fear is that, as we approach the",34
NA,"year 2000, unless there is some serious and",34
NA,"rapid upgrading of that road, along with the",34
NA,"greater volumes of traffic on that highway,",34
NA,including more buses particularly in that,34
NA,"period before the Olympics, we will see more",34
NA,of those dreadful bus crashes that occurred a,34
NA,few years ago. I think the answer to this,34
NA,problem is that the Pacific Highway does,34
NA,need to become part of the national highway,34
NA,system. It does need additional funding to,34
NA,accelerate the work being done on it. We,34
NA,"need to be serious about this, and we do not",34
NA,need to raise people's hopes falsely. I notice,34
NA,paragraph (4) of the motion moved by the,34
NA,member for Cowper says 'endorses the need,34
NA,for special priority funding for the Pacific,34
NA,Highway'. I support that.,34
NA,I will refer to a couple of instances that,34
NA,occurred recently in my electorate which have,34
NA,led me to doubt the sincerity of the opposition,34
NA,on this matter. The shadow minister for,34
NA,transport was in my electorate recently and he,34
NA,announced that the coalition would have a,34
NA,new category of roads called roads of national,34
NA,importance. He said the Summerland Way,34
NA,was one of those roads of national importance,34
NA,"and that he would provide, if elected, $38",34
NA,million towards upgrading it.,34
NA,But when questioned by the Lismore Echo,34
NA,he said the funding would be sought on a,34
NA,fifty-fifty basis with the state government to,34
NA,achieve the figure of $38 million to be spent,34
NA,over a period of five to six years. The new,34
NA,New South Wales government has already,34
NA,promised $50 million over that period and,34
NA,this year is spending over $6 million on the,34
NA,"Summerland Way, far in excess of what was",34
NA,spent under a coalition government. Even on,34
NA,"that basis it is a funny sort of promise, but",34
NA,when you look at some of the policy docu-,34
NA,ments that have come into our hands you can,34
NA,understand why.,34
NA,The policy document headed 'Structural,34
NA,reform management group: regional and rural,34
NA,"development' has the name Bruce Scott,",34
NA,shadow minister for regional and rural devel-,34
NA,"opment, at the bottom. When talking about",34
NA,infrastructure on this policy document he,34
NA,says:,34
NA,"We need to set a figure ($1 billion, $3 billion-the",34
NA,actual number is insignificant) as an indication of,34
NA,"our commitment to putting roads, dams, port,",34
NA,"airports, bridges, whatever, into regional Australia.",34
NA,We should also then allude to some sort of assess-,34
NA,ment procedure by which regions can directly seek,34
NA,funding ...,34
NA,"In a further document, a briefing paper to",34
NA,"shadow cabinet, when talking about infra-",34
NA,structure the shadow minister for regional,34
NA,development and infrastructure stated:,34
NA,The problem with proposals in infrastructure is how,34
NA,to give us the flexibility to campaign properly,34
NA,without being so specific as to lock us into particu-,34
NA,lar projects which then of necessity must rule out,34
NA,others.,34
NA,He further said:,34
NA,This gives us the flexibility of announcing a lot of,34
NA,major long term visionary matters but without,34
NA,committing ourselves to actually proceeding with,34
NA,them.,34
NA,"I ask the members opposite, when talking",34
NA,"about the Pacific Highway and country roads,",34
NA,not to raise those hopes and tell people we are,34
NA,going to do something when we have these,34
NA,sorts of documents which are hypocritical in,34
NA,the extreme.,34
NA,"The member for Cowper was, of course,",34
NA,right in saying that the federal government no,34
NA,longer puts money directly into the Pacific,34
NA,Highway. We had the provincial cities and,34
NA,"rural highways program from 1990 to 1993,",34
NA,which put $300 million into the Pacific,34
NA,Highway. That was discontinued as a result of,34
NA,"the 1991 Premiers Conference, in which it",34
NA,was resolved to more clearly define the roles,34
NA,and responsibilities of each level of govern-,34
NA,ment for funding of both maintenance and,34
NA,improvements. That agreement was signed-,34
NA,"in other words, agreed to-by the New South",34
NA,Wales government. That government at the,34
NA,time was a coalition government. The agree-,34
NA,ment reinforced the historical links between,34
NA,the New South Wales government and its,34
NA,commitment to the Pacific Highway.,34
NA,"The state government agreed, as part of that",34
NA,"agreement, to fully fund improvement works",34
NA,for the highway as it had always done. In the,34
NA,"five years leading up to this year, the average",34
NA,"spent by the state government----:that is, the",34
NA,coalition government-on the Pacific High-,35
NA,"way was $74 million a year. This year, under",35
NA,"a New South Wales Labor government, the",35
NA,figure was in excess of $100 million. It is still,35
NA,not enough. Still we need more improve-,35
NA,ments.,35
NA,I understand the quandary of the member,35
NA,for Cowper. In paragraph (4) of the motion he,35
NA,moves that the House 'endorses the need for,35
NA,special priority funding for the Pacific,35
NA,Highway'. The question is how we get it. It,35
NA,"is, by the agreement I have mentioned, a state",35
NA,government responsibility. There is no doubt,35
NA,about that. The money that the federal,35
NA,government was putting in as part of that,35
NA,agreement was paid to the states in an untied,35
NA,way. In excess of $100 million per annum,35
NA,was provided to cover both the black spots,35
NA,program and the provincial cities and rural,35
NA,"highways program. As part of that, we took",35
NA,into the national highway system the Newell,35
NA,and Sturt highways.,35
NA,"As part of the agreement, the Pacific High-",35
NA,way stays part of the state responsibility.,35
NA,"unlikely, under present circumstances, that the",35
NA,federal government will step in. We have a,35
NA,hullabaloo from the opposition about roads of,35
NA,national importance. I do not know if the,35
NA,Pacific Highway will also be made part of the,35
NA,"roads of national importance program, but it",35
NA,is worth noting-and it shows real hypocri-,35
NA,"sy-that, when the member for Hume ( Mr",35
NA,Sharp) was asked about where these roads of,35
NA,"national importance would be, he said, 'Obvi-",35
NA,"ously, they would focus on marginal elector-",35
NA,ates.' That is a rather cynical view when you,35
NA,are talking about deaths and trauma on roads.,35
NA,There are no free rides as far as funding,35
NA,goes. The answer is for negotiations to go on,35
NA,"between the New South Wales government,",35
NA,the Queensland government and the federal,35
NA,"government, with the aim of making the",35
NA,Pacific Highway part of the national highway,35
NA,"system, with a long-term plan-though as",35
NA,short-term as possible-to improve it to a,35
NA,state where it can take the sort of traffic that,35
NA,it is receiving at the moment and will do in,35
NA,increasing loads in the future.,35
NA,"In essence, I support the motion, but I",35
NA,would ask the member for Cowper and other,35
NA,"members, when they are talking about these",35
NA,"issues, to try to be factual about them and to",35
NA,"look at the issues involved. As I say, I can",35
NA,understand the member for Cowper's quan-,35
NA,dary because it is difficult for him to propose,35
NA,the Pacific Highway as part of the national,35
NA,highway system-though he did in the past-,35
NA,because he recognises that on his side of,35
NA,parliament it is more than likely politically,35
NA,unachievable because it would mean the,35
NA,dropping of the New England Highway as,35
NA,part of the national highway system. That,35
NA,would be opposed very strongly by his Na-,35
NA,tional Party colleagues from over the moun-,35
NA,tains.,35
NA,Let us try to work towards the Pacific,35
NA,Highway as part of the national highway,35
NA,system. (Time expired),35
Mr CADMAN ,Mitchell) (2.30 p.m.)-For,35
NA,the first time since there has been a concen-,35
NA,trated state-wide concern with the Pacific,35
NA,Highway we have two governments of the,35
NA,same political persuasion responsible for the,35
NA,funding of roads in New South Wales. They,35
NA,It is are the Carr Labor government and the,35
NA,Keating Labor government.,35
NA,These two governments of the same politi-,35
NA,cal persuasion have made noises over the year,35
NA,as to what should be the results for the Pacific,35
NA,"Highway. First, Mr Carr promised $100",35
NA,million a year-just a marginal increase on,35
NA,what was already being provided by the,35
NA,coalition government. There is no real com-,35
NA,mitment from the Carr government to carry,35
NA,out a massive task for the Pacific Highway.,35
NA,What does the Prime Minister ( Mr Keating),35
NA,"say? He says, 'Talk to the states. I am not",35
NA,paying for two roads.' But the killing goes,35
NA,on.,35
NA,We are getting some bright ideas about,35
NA,what should happen. The member for Rich-,35
NA,"mond ( Mr Newell) says, 'Shove up some",35
NA,more signs on the Burringbar Road.' I have,35
NA,the reports of it here. The members for Page,35
NA,( Mr Harry Woods) and Paterson ( Mr Home),35
NA,are not reading their local newspapers. There,35
NA,"are accidents occurring, people being killed",35
NA,"and your people are saying, 'Put up more",35
NA,signs.' The mayors of that area are calling for,35
NA,major roadworks because they have to live,35
NA,with the accidents that occur in the rain.,35
NA,People are killed there.,35
NA,This is a killer road. The area from Hexham,36
NA,right through to the border does need redoing.,36
NA,Instead of coming up with ideas about road,36
NA,signs and instead of making placatory remarks,36
NA,"about how difficult it is, the ALP should",36
NA,make some decisions. The Australian Labor,36
NA,Party are in office. They can make decisions.,36
NA,Forget about picking up bits of paper you find,36
NA,floating around and about criticising the,36
NA,opposition. You guys can actually make,36
NA,decisions. You are in government.,36
NA,The Australian Labor Party are in govern-,36
NA,ment. They can spend the taxpayer's money.,36
NA,They can make a decision. Their cabinets are,36
NA,"in government with the powers to act. But,",36
NA,no. They prefer to fight this argument on bits,36
NA,of paper they find floating around and by,36
NA,"saying, 'The coalition will not do anything.'",36
NA,What a bunch of wimps they are. How un-,36
NA,committed are they to the people and the,36
NA,needs of the north coast? You know what that,36
NA,road is like.,36
NA,I have been talking about the advantage of,36
NA,having both federal and state governments,36
NA,involved. What about the Billinudgel decision,36
NA,taken by Bob Carr to wipe out a section of,36
NA,"freeway? He just said, 'I am not going to do",36
NA,it. We are going to have an inquiry or some-,36
NA,thing or other. Forget about it.' I do not,36
NA,how much expenditure that decision of the,36
NA,state government has postponed. If you make,36
NA,"the promises, you have to deliver. You are in",36
NA,government in Canberra; you are in govern-,36
NA,ment in Macquarie Street. The Australian,36
NA,Labor Party ought to do something to fix this,36
NA,road up.,36
NA,Are you going to make announcements for,36
NA,"the next federal election? If you do, not too",36
NA,many people are going to believe that process,36
NA,because they have seen both Paul Keating and,36
NA,Bob Carr make commitments to the Pacific,36
NA,Highway. One delivered his promise. One has,36
NA,partially delivered. It is not going anywhere,36
NA,as a result of the way in which you are,36
NA,handling this. One has to say that if you bring,36
NA,the speed limit down to zero on Tintenbar,36
NA,Hill you are going to get zero accidents. That,36
NA,is the way it is heading. This is the sort of,36
NA,result you are achieving as a Labor Party for,36
NA,a major thoroughfare.,36
NA,The fastest growing area in Australia is up,36
NA,along the north coast of New South Wales.,36
NA,There are opportunities for you to make a,36
NA,major contribution to national growth. You,36
NA,want to pause and analyse what the coalition,36
NA,"might have said three, five or two years ago.",36
NA,"Take some action instead, because this is a",36
NA,killer road.,36
NA,Likeable though the members for Page and,36
NA,"Richmond may be, they are never going to",36
NA,achieve anything on the north coast. Nothing,36
NA,is going to be achieved up there until there is,36
NA,a change of members and a change of govern-,36
NA,"ment, federally and in the state of New South",36
NA,Wales. I appeal to the voters in those areas to,36
NA,take action and make sure these guys are,36
NA,rolled out of their seats so that Liberal or,36
NA,National Party members can be elected and so,36
NA,that there can be a proper program com-,36
NA,menced and a real commitment to some,36
NA,action to rectify the problems of the Pacific,36
NA,Highway.,36
Mr HORNE ,Paterson) (2.35 p.m.)-I rise,36
NA,to address this motion today having had a,36
NA,"look through the Hansard record, so I know",36
NA,it seems to be somewhat of an annual visit,36
NA,that the honourable member for Cowper ( Mr,36
NA,Nehl) makes to this issue. I can tell you what,36
NA,will not appear in the Taree Times or the,36
NA,"know Coffs Harbour Clarion, and that is that the",36
NA,Carr government has increased funding on the,36
NA,Pacific Highway by 36 per cent. That will,36
NA,definitely not appear in any of your papers,36
NA,because you would not dare tell people.,36
NA,You come here and criticise the federal,36
NA,government for not funding a state road that,36
NA,was declared in 1974. The agreement between,36
NA,the then Askin government and the federal,36
NA,government under Gough Whitlam was that,36
NA,the Pacific Highway would be a state road.,36
NA,"When the Carr government came in, we",36
NA,immediately saw an increase in funding. That,36
NA,is the commitment of the Australian Labor,36
NA,Party to the Pacific Highway. I think you,36
NA,gentlemen would be wise not to forget it.,36
NA,"If you want to talk about facts, maybe you",36
NA,should go back to the fact that grants became,36
NA,untied last year. This is the first time in,36
NA,history that grants have not been tied to a,36
NA,specific purpose. What did we see the then,36
NA,Fahey government do with the first $50,36
NA,million given to that state for road funding?,37
NA,We saw them spend it on City Rail. As much,37
NA,as there is a demand by the people on the,37
NA,north coast for increased funding on the,37
NA,"Pacific Highway, the Fahey government took",37
NA,the first $50 million in untied road funding,37
NA,and spent it on City Rail. That is the sort of,37
NA,commitment that your side of politics has to,37
NA,this important highway.,37
NA,I can tell members that the federal govern-,37
NA,ment has continued to fund the Pacific High-,37
NA,"way. It has made major commitments, and the",37
NA,honourable member for Cowper alluded to,37
NA,and acknowledged this. In my own electorate,37
NA,"the planning, the acquisition, the roundabouts",37
NA,for the Raymond Terrace bypass and the,37
NA,black spots funding between Raymond Ter-,37
NA,race and Nabiac in the electorate of Paterson,37
NA,have been funded by the federal government.,37
NA,Those opposite keep talking about policies,37
NA,"and about changes that will come in if, by",37
NA,"some freak of nature, they happen to be on",37
NA,this side of the House after the next election.,37
NA,But let us just consider what one of your,37
NA,leaders told the annual conference of the,37
NA,National Farmers Federation. Every time we,37
NA,hear from that side of the House there is a,37
NA,"different policy being put forward, but I will",37
NA,"remind members that, at the annual confer-",37
NA,"ence of the National Farmers Federation, Tim",37
NA,Fischer said that your side of politics would,37
NA,not increase funding for rural and regional,37
NA,roads in Australia because they did not want,37
NA,to run the risk of increasing interest rates by,37
NA,competing for capital.,37
NA,What policy will we accept from the Na-,37
NA,tional Party of Australia? I prefer to take,37
NA,policy of the leader when he is addressing an,37
NA,organisation as influential as the National,37
NA,Farmers Federation. But I guess we will not,37
NA,know until an election is called when prob-,37
NA,"ably some more sexy, if I can use that adjec-",37
NA,"tive, policies come out that might appeal to",37
NA,voters. But I can tell you that those policies,37
NA,will definitely not contain the facts of the,37
NA,matter. They will not reveal the real level of,37
NA,funding by state and federal Labor govern-,37
NA,ments on the Pacific Highway; they will,37
NA,"attempt to conceal that, because that side of",37
NA,this House knows that it is Labor govern-,37
NA,"ments, both state and federal, that have had",37
NA,the commitment all along to funding a road,37
NA,"which, federally, we do not have the responsi-",37
NA,bility for.,37
NA,"Parallel to the Pacific Highway, of course,",37
NA,runs our national rail line. We have seen,37
NA,significant funding there by the federal Labor,37
NA,government. We have seen an attempt to get,37
NA,the transport industry to use rail rather than,37
NA,"road, to get the heavy transport off the road-",37
NA,way. I am sure that those members opposite,37
NA,know that the major problem on this road is,37
NA,caused by the fact that so many transporters,37
NA,"use it. It seems logical with the streamlining,",37
NA,"the upgrading, of rail infrastructure that that",37
NA,should happen. (Time expired),37
Mr VAILE ,Lyne) (2.40 p.m.)-It was,37
NA,interesting to listen to the member for Pater-,37
NA,son ( Mr Home) participate in this debate. I,37
NA,"was pleased to see him do so, because I",37
NA,looked at what he had to say the last time we,37
NA,visited this issue back in 1993. He said:,37
NA,What the honourable member for Cowper ( Mr,37
NA,Nehl) attempted to do with the private member's,37
NA,motion this morning was to move the responsibility,37
NA,for that road from the coalition government of New,37
NA,South Wales to the federal government.,37
NA,So he is saying it is a state government,37
NA,responsibility. And he has just been talking,37
NA,about the increase the Carr government has,37
NA,allocated to the spending OIl the Pacific,37
NA,Highway. He might tell the House why the,37
NA,Carr government has completely canned the,37
NA,proposition of the Bulahdelah Mountain,37
NA,"bypass, which was locked in place under the",37
NA,previous coalition government. The acquisi-,37
NA,"tions were done and the design was done, but",37
NA,the the Carr government is not going to do it-,37
NA,$120 million worth. It is the most important,37
NA,black spot on the Pacific Highway today.,37
NA,It always intrigues me when we get into,37
NA,debates like this that we get back to the,37
NA,semantics of what you can and cannot do.,37
NA,The bureaucracy in Australia is running,37
NA,rampant. In my years in public life in local,37
NA,"government and in this place, I have been",37
NA,absolutely appalled at the attitude of the,37
NA,bureaucracy being focused on finding reasons,37
NA,why we cannot do something.,37
NA,The problem at hand is that we have a 700-,37
NA,odd kilometre road that in the last 10 years,37
NA,"has not seen 600 people killed, as Mr",38
NA,Carleton reported on 60 Minutes last night; it,38
NA,"has seen 766 people killed and 10,000 people",38
NA,injured. It is an absolute disgrace. Yet we,38
NA,"keep on saying, 'It's a state responsibility.",38
NA,not our responsibility. They took it on in,38
NA,"1974, let the states fix it.'",38
NA,What happened to the national perspective?,38
NA,This is a road of national economic import-,38
NA,ance running between Sydney and Brisbane.,38
NA,"Regardless of what you say, the region is",38
NA,"growing at an enormous rate. Over 500,000",38
NA,people live in the region. It is a road of major,38
NA,"economic importance as a transport link,",38
NA,notwithstanding the rail between Sydney and,38
NA,Brisbane. We have to find a way of doing,38
NA,"something about it and not just saying, 'It's",38
NA,their responsibility. We haven't got the,38
NA,money.',38
NA,The federal government collects $10 billion,38
NA,from road users in Australia-$10 billion! In,38
NA,this year's budget they have spent $850,38
NA,million. So over the life of the Labor govern-,38
NA,ment in Australia we have seen those two,38
NA,figures part-the amount collected heading up,38
NA,on an increasing tangent and the amount,38
NA,being spent going down. So just remember,38
NA,"those figures, Mr Speaker: $10 billion col-",38
NA,lected and $850 million spent.,38
NA,Fuel tax revenue has increased from around,38
NA,8c a litre in 1983 to 33c a litre today. But we,38
NA,are not seeing it spent back on the roads. We,38
NA,are not even seeing a reasonable percentage,38
NA,of it being spent back on the roads.,38
NA,The motion moved by the member for,38
NA,Cowper ( Mr Nehl) today has a number of,38
NA,"parts. The speakers today, coming from the",38
NA,"areas they represent, are putting the most",38
NA,importance on the Pacific Highway because,38
NA,it is one of the most important pieces of,38
NA,infrastructure in Australia that has been totally,38
NA,neglected. We have not seen the Federal,38
NA,"Highway, the Hume Highway or the highways",38
NA,down in this end of the country referred to.,38
NA,"When you come south of Sydney, you are on",38
NA,magnificent roads all the way to the country's,38
NA,capital and all points south. When you go,38
NA,north it is a different story.,38
NA,The motion is about getting a realistic,38
NA,amount of revenue collected by the Common-,38
NA,wealth allocated by whatever means. It does,38
NA,not matter how it goes-whether it is back to,38
NA,the states as untied grants or SPPs going,38
NA,straight to local government. We just want to,38
NA,It's see a reasonable amount of the money that is,38
NA,collected by the Commonwealth aimed back,38
NA,at where it should be going-into road infra-,38
NA,"structure whether it be on highways, country",38
NA,"roads, country bridges or bridges in the city.",38
NA,We see plenty of money spent around the,38
NA,"city, but the point is that it is not being",38
NA,redirected. I would like to know where a lot,38
NA,of that $10 billion is going-and so too,38
NA,would a lot of the people that pay petrol tax.,38
NA,So it is important that we focus on that,38
NA,"issue because of the size of Australia, the",38
NA,tyranny of distance. We are a very unique,38
NA,country: an enormous country with a small,38
NA,"population. As I said, we are paying $10",38
NA,billion in fuel taxes. The government has,38
NA,spent $850 million back on the roads. We are,38
NA,not seeing enough money being spent. We,38
NA,have to find a way instead of coming in here,38
NA,"and saying, 'We can't do it because of this",38
NA,and this or because of some 1974 agreement.',38
NA,It is 20 years later!,38
NA,What if we stuck to the values and the,38
NA,traditions that were in place in 1974 on all the,38
NA,social issues in this country. There would be,38
NA,some bleeding going on from over there! The,38
NA,thing is we have to get up into 1995. We,38
NA,have 1995 vehicles running on these roads. In,38
NA,"the last IO years, 766 people have been killed.",38
Mr SPEAKER,"Order! It being 2.45 p.m.,",38
NA,the debate is interrupted in accordance with,38
NA,"standing order 104A. The debate is adjourned,",38
NA,and the resumption of the debate will be made,38
NA,an order of the day for the next sitting Mon-,38
NA,day. The member will have leave to continue,38
NA,speaking for about one second when the,38
NA,debate is resumed.,38
NA,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,38
NA,Election Campaign,38
Ms WORTH ,"Adelaide)-Last week, the",38
NA,United Trades and Labour Council document,38
NA,titled 1996 Federal election planning was,38
NA,"leaked. Amongst the seven pages of detail,",38
NA,the unions set out their plans to distort and,38
NA,disrupt the next federal election. The strategy,38
NA,spelt out was to develop a 'third' party cam-,38
NA,paign of 'fear and loathing' in the run-up to,39
NA,the next federal election. Decent men and,39
NA,"women should be horrified by this, and I",39
NA,know that individual unionists are outraged,39
NA,that their organisation should act in this,39
NA,The document says nothing about truly,39
NA,supporting workers.,39
NA,"Before entering parliament, I worked con-",39
NA,structively with an industrial officer at the,39
NA,Nurses Federation to ensure that jobs were not,39
NA,lost and that suitably trained staff would be,39
NA,employed in a particular area. As a member,39
NA,"of parliament, I have worked with unionists",39
NA,to ensure that their safety concerns would be,39
NA,heard by Australian national management,39
NA,"This is how it should be, but now a document",39
NA,is published which spells out details of how,39
NA,individuals will be used by union leaders as,39
NA,"industrial fodder, including being used in",39
NA,'demonstrations and rallies'. My union leader,39
NA,opponent in Adelaide has already embarked,39
NA,"upon the 'fear and loathing' campaign, using",39
NA,nurses in industrial action for her own politi-,39
NA,cal purposes instead of encouraging them to,39
NA,"have real influence in public policy, to be",39
NA,taken seriously and so constructively effect,39
NA,change.,39
NA,Greece: Pension Arrangements,39
Mrs EASSON ,Lowe)--In early November,39
NA,"this year, representatives from the Department",39
NA,of Social Security met informally in Stras-,39
NA,bourg with representatives from the Greek,39
NA,government to discuss an agreement between,39
NA,our two countries concerning pension arrange-,39
NA,ments. The Minister for Social Security ( Mr,39
NA,Baldwin) and the department are doing a,39
NA,"good job in this difficult field but, standing",39
NA,"back from the details, I can see that no",39
NA,agreement can actually be reached in the,39
NA,manner that Australia would like.,39
NA,We have over a century of very accurate,39
NA,"social and economic records, but Greece has",39
NA,not. Many of the Greek migrants came to,39
NA,Australia from rural and island communities,39
NA,"where bureaucracy was minimal, if existent at",39
NA,all. Australia should realise,39
NA,minimum accuracy and perfection in a future,39
NA,agreement is not feasible. The matter will,39
NA,need to be settled at a political level.,39
NA,We are dealing with a generation of Greeks,39
NA,who stood by our men and women in the last,39
NA,war and during the last catastrophic Greek,39
NA,"campaign, and I speak often of this matter in",39
NA,way. this House. We must as a nation be loyal to,39
NA,those who at that time were loyal to us. If we,39
NA,"are not, we will not have much loyalty shown",39
NA,to us in the future.,39
NA,My suggestion is that a broad political,39
NA,"settlement, a generous settlement, be made.",39
NA,"We are rich and prosperous, thanks largely to",39
NA,"postwar migration, and we can afford to be",39
NA,generous and appreciative. This matter is not,39
NA,one of bureaucracy but is a matter which,39
NA,reflects the unbroken bounds between Greece,39
NA,and Australia. Let us show our qualities by,39
NA,"not haggling, and let us show our thanks to",39
NA,those who did the hard postwar work in this,39
NA,country. Australia has a great future. Let us,39
NA,add loyalty and generosity to our list of,39
NA,national characteristics and resolve the Greek,39
NA,pension issue.,39
NA,Labor Party Policies,39
Mr ROCHER ,Curtin)-In the run-up to,39
NA,"the election, and this probably being the last",39
NA,"sitting of this parliament, I want to go over",39
NA,some of the policy issues which seem to be,39
NA,so important to those opposite. Let me remind,39
NA,the House about policy undertakings given by,39
NA,this government before the 1993 election.,39
NA,People will remember the one about how it,39
NA,was going to give us a government that we,39
NA,can trust. Trust does not figure among the,39
NA,"attributes of this government, from any",39
NA,quarter.,39
NA,What about big reductions in hospital,39
NA,waiting lists? They continue to grow and,39
NA,grow. What about the building of the National,39
NA,Museum of Australia? Not a sod has been,39
NA,turned. What about the establishment of a,39
NA,single air market between Australia and New,39
NA,Zealand? Some New Zealanders even believed,39
NA,the government. What about increases in,39
NA,foreign aid? That is made up of an increased,39
NA,number of trips by the Minister for Foreign,39
NA,"Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), and that is it.",39
NA,that a pursuit of It has come down.,39
NA,What about the creation of the emergency,39
NA,dental fund for low income earners? That is,39
NA,another one they could not bite on. What,39
NA,about the use of super for home buyers?,40
NA,Another super deception. Then we had real,40
NA,"industrial relations reform, which proved",40
NA,again that reform is the most misused word in,40
NA,"Labor's lexicon. They said, 'No taxes for age",40
NA,"pensioners,' but the age pensioners of this",40
NA,country are still waiting.,40
NA,We know about the I-a-w law tax cuts. But,40
NA,I-a-w spells 'lie' in Labor's language. We,40
NA,know about the promise that there would be,40
NA,"no new taxes, but that was blatantly broken.",40
NA,You could have fooled me. They promised no,40
NA,more budget deficits. No more than one a,40
NA,"year, they meant. (Time expired)",40
NA,Kennett Government,40
Mr OCONNOR ,Corio)-When Jeff,40
NA,"Kennett came to power in Victoria, he gave",40
NA,this undertaking to Victorian and Geelong,40
NA,workers that none of them would be worse off,40
NA,under a Kennett Liberal state government. Yet,40
NA,"on coming to power, the workers of that state",40
NA,faced an awful betrayal in that their wages,40
NA,and conditions were attacked via the 'take the,40
NA,contract or take the sack' policies of the,40
NA,Kennett government.,40
NA,We know in this House that Jeff Kennett,40
NA,"has one big supporter, and that is John How-",40
NA,ard. He supports the policies of the Kennett,40
NA,government and of the Court government in,40
NA,Western Australia. We know recently that Jeff,40
NA,Kennett has indicated to both the Geelong and,40
NA,"the Victorian work force that, with the elec-",40
NA,"tion of a Howard government, workers in",40
NA,Victoria will have nowhere else to go. We,40
NA,know what that means.,40
NA,There was only one government that,40
NA,stepped into the ring to protect the Victorian,40
NA,work force from the industrial excesses,40
NA,"Kennett government, and that was Paul",40
NA,Keating and a Labor government. It was Paul,40
NA,Keating and a Labor government that stood,40
NA,"over Jeff Kennett, put him back in his place",40
NA,"and said, 'We will offer workers in the state",40
NA,of Victoria the sanctity and protection of,40
NA,federal industrial award system.' In my,40
NA,"electorate, a librarian had her wages cut by",40
NA,"$10,000 under the policies of the Kennett",40
NA,Liberal government. (Time expired),40
NA,Nuclear Testing,40
Mr COBB ,Parkes)-I wish to register a,40
NA,protest against the continuing testing of,40
NA,nuclear weapons by China. Much has been,40
NA,"said, and rightly so, against the French nu-",40
NA,clear testing in the Pacific. But most mem-,40
NA,"bers, especially government members, have",40
NA,been largely mute on communist China.,40
NA,Testing there is done at Lop Nor in the,40
NA,"Xinjiang province, which contains 14Yz",40
NA,million people in the Chinese occupied East,40
NA,Turkestan region. It is the largest nuclear,40
NA,testing site in the world. Forty-three tests have,40
NA,"been conducted there since 1964, with 23 in",40
NA,the atmosphere up until 1980. Until August,40
NA,"this year, four had been conducted in the last",40
NA,14 months. They have reputedly three to go.,40
NA,The site is a similar distance from or even,40
NA,closer to Australia than the site at Mururoa,40
NA,"Atoll. It is very near Mongolia, Tibet, India,",40
NA,Pakistan and other countries. Testing there,40
NA,will only stir up Pakistan and North Korea to,40
NA,step up their weapons testing programs. China,40
NA,has dragged its feet on being a good world,40
NA,citizen. It was the last of the nuclear capable,40
NA,nations to sign the nuclear non-proliferation,40
NA,"treaty of 1970, which it signed only in 1991.",40
NA,The world should put pressure on China to,40
NA,cease its present testing program.,40
NA,Fuel Prices,40
Mr CLEELAND ,MCEwen)-The member,40
NA,for Lyne ( Mr Vaile) just made a speech about,40
NA,fuel excises but he forgot to tell the House,40
NA,that all fuel excise is spent on hospitals and,40
NA,"education, among a host of other things. So",40
NA,it is not forgotten; it is spent. The other thing,40
NA,"the member forgot is that this parliament, the",40
NA,"Commonwealth, has no constitutional power",40
NA,over prices. That was defeated in a referen-,40
NA,of the dum way back in 1974.,40
NA,"The states, however, do have power over",40
NA,prices. The Victorian government has power,40
NA,over prices. His colleagues in the National,40
NA,Party run around Victoria nonstop complain-,40
NA,ing about fuel prices. They seem to have,40
NA,the forgotten that they have the constitutional,40
NA,power in state government to control those,40
NA,fuel prices. They ran around before the last,40
NA,election saying they would introduce new,40
NA,terminal systems into rural Victoria to reduce,40
NA,price. They won government but somehow,41
NA,they have forgotten that they now have the,41
NA,power to change the pricing structure of fuel,41
NA,in rural Victoria. So when I hear the National,41
NA,"Party members complain about fuel prices, I",41
NA,"say to them, 'Go and talk to your state col-",41
NA,leagues in Victoria who are in government,41
NA,and tell them that they can do something,41
NA,about it.',41
NA,Landcare and Environment Action Plan,41
Mr HAWKER ,Wannon)-I would like to,41
NA,tell you just how miserable the current,41
NA,Keating government really is. Not only is it,41
NA,artificially trying to suppress the true state of,41
NA,unemployment but also those people on,41
NA,government benefits are now finding that their,41
NA,benefits are being reduced when they are put,41
NA,through this process. I draw your attention to,41
NA,a case in my electorate where someone has,41
NA,been put on a landcare and environment,41
NA,action program or LEAP. This constituent has,41
NA,just turned 18 and was assigned to a 20-week,41
NA,training course. Prior to being assigned to,41
NA,"LEAP, this constituent received $318 each",41
NA,"fortnight from Social Security, which included",41
NA,rent assistance. But as a LEAP participant he,41
NA,"receives only $300 a fortnight. Also, this",41
NA,"payment is taxable, and he no longer gets rent",41
NA,assistance.,41
NA,He is getting approximately $270 after tax,41
NA,from which he has to pay $170 per fortnight,41
NA,"in rent. In other words, he is nearly $60 per",41
NA,fortnight worse off. I think this shows just,41
NA,how miserable the Keating government is.,41
NA,Not only is the government trying to doctor,41
NA,the unemployment figures by thinking up,41
NA,some schemes-some of which may have,41
NA,benefits in their own right; nevertheless the,41
NA,primary objective is to reduce the figures on,41
NA,the unemployment list-but in so doing the,41
NA,government is reducing the benefits to these,41
NA,people at a time-(Time expired),41
NA,Health Services,41
Mr HAVILAND ,Macarthur)-I listened,41
NA,with interest to the honourable member for,41
NA,Curtin ( Mr Rocher). For an Independent,41
NA,member of this House he was surprisingly,41
NA,anti-government. He attacked the govern-,41
NA,ment's policies. He did not sound like an,41
NA,"Independent at all. Indeed, he was scraping",41
NA,the bottom of the barrel to try to remember,41
NA,some of the policies that he was criticising.,41
NA,One of the matters mentioned by the hon-,41
NA,ourable member was hospital waiting lists. I,41
NA,was surprised to hear that because hospital,41
NA,waiting lists are one of these convenient,41
NA,issues that state governments and the coalition,41
NA,in this House use to bash the federal govern-,41
NA,ment around the head. Hospital waiting lists,41
NA,might be a problem in Western Australia,41
NA,"under the Court government, but we see",41
NA,encouraging signs in New South Wales that,41
NA,the issue of hospital waiting lists has been,41
NA,brought under control by the new Labor,41
NA,"government and the Minister for Health,",41
NA,Andrew Refshauge. This matter was made an,41
NA,issue at the last state election by the former,41
NA,Liberal government.,41
NA,Not only has this matter been brought under,41
NA,"control by the Labor government, but there",41
NA,are encouraging signs in New South Wales-,41
NA,unlike other states-where a lot more money,41
NA,is being spent and a lot more commitment has,41
NA,been given to mental health. Let us not have,41
NA,this nonsense about health. If there is one,41
NA,issue that the opposition in this parliament,41
NA,should keep quiet about-apart from indus-,41
NA,trial relations-it is health policy. As those,41
NA,"opposite know, Medicare is a very popular",41
NA,health system and it wiII become even better,41
NA,the longer this government stays in office.,41
NA,The opposition does not have a policy on,41
NA,health; the AMA has not written it yet. The,41
NA,opposition is totally lacking when it comes to,41
NA,policies on health and industrial relations.,41
NA,City Link Project,41
Mr CLEARY ,Wills)-I cannot let the,41
NA,response by the Prime Minister ( Mr Keating),41
NA,to my question on the City Link project go,41
NA,without a response. It is remarkable that the,41
NA,Prime Minister can talk about Jeff Kennett-,41
NA,"not remarkable, because everything he says",41
NA,about Jeff Kennett is basically right-but he,41
NA,does not want to rectify any of the problems.,41
NA,The member for Corio ( Mr O'Connor) is,41
NA,"correct on the issue of state awards, but when",41
NA,it comes to the question of tax concessions to,41
NA,the City Link project the Prime Minister has,41
NA,absolutely nothing to say. He has accused Jeff,41
NA,Kennett of just about everything bar being an,41
NA,"axe murderer, but he is not going to take",42
NA,those tax concessions from him.,42
NA,I want to know whether our architectural,42
NA,"aficionado, the Prime Minister, is going to",42
NA,bail us out in Vicloria and refuse to give the,42
NA,state government tax concessions. I would,42
NA,also like to know whether the shadow Treas-,42
NA,urer ( Mr Costello )-who is present-might,42
NA,make a statement suggesting that he would,42
NA,refuse to give the state government tax con-,42
NA,cessions for a project which is quite clearly,42
NA,anti-competition and which would break all,42
NA,environmental regulations.,42
NA,Tertiary Education,42
Mr SWAN ,Lilley)-Last week in the,42
NA,Senate the Liberal and National parties,42
NA,"knocked off 4,200 additional tertiary educa-",42
NA,tion places for young Queenslanders. Queens-,42
NA,land was given its fair share of tertiary places,42
NA,and the Liberal and National parties in the,42
NA,Senate knocked them back. Those in the,42
NA,Senate responsible for that should hang their,42
NA,heads in shame. I refer to Senator Ian Mac-,42
NA,"donald, Senator MACGibbon, Senator Parer,",42
NA,"Senator O'Chee, Senator Herron and Senator",42
NA,Boswell. Every Liberal Party and National,42
NA,Party member in this House and in the Senate,42
NA,should hang their heads in shame.,42
NA,Queenslanders should ring and fax members,42
NA,of the Liberal and National parties and tell,42
NA,them to reverse their stand. Liberal and,42
NA,National Party members should stand up for,42
NA,Queensland; not come into this parliament,42
NA,and destroy the educational future of young,42
NA,Queenslanders. It is an act of shame. Liberal,42
NA,and National Party members should be asham-,42
NA,ed of what they have done to the job pros-,42
NA,pects and career prospects of young Queens-,42
NA,landers. Those opposite should change their,42
NA,stance and vote for Queensland in the Senate.,42
NA,ACTU Representation,42
Mr FILING ,Moore)-One of the things,42
NA,that upset me when the former Prime,42
NA,Minister's services were used by the ACTU,42
NA,in the CRA case was the way in which people,42
NA,assumed that the ski lIs of retired people are,42
NA,of no further use to the community. In my,42
NA,"view, the ACTU was perfectly entitled to",42
NA,recaIl the former Prime Minister to represent,42
NA,it in the case. Many retired people in the,42
NA,community have skiIls which are perfectly,42
NA,usable. These people are extremely useful to,42
NA,the community. The way in which the former,42
NA,Prime Minister was criticised by the present,42
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Keating) was absolutely,42
NA,scandalous.,42
Mr SPEAKER,"Order! It being 3 p.m., in",42
NA,"accordance with standing order 106A, the",42
NA,time for members' statements has concluded.,42
NA,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,42
Mr KEATING ,Blaxland-Prime,42
NA,Minister)-I inform the House that the,42
NA,"Attorney-General, Michael Lavarch, will be",42
NA,absent from question time this week as he is,42
NA,"ill. The Minister for Justice, Duncan Kerr,",42
NA,will answer questions on his behalf.,42
NA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,42
NA,Taxation,42
Mr COSTELLO,My question is directed,42
NA,"to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, do you",42
NA,agree with the statement by the Treasurer this,42
NA,morning that it would be foolish to rule out,42
NA,new taxes if Labor is re-elected at the next,42
NA,election?,42
Mr KEATING,I noticed the opposition,42
NA,slippin' and slidin' all over the TV screens all,42
NA,"weekend, teIling anyone what they wanted to",42
NA,believe on fiscal policy. So they are being,42
NA,asked. The Leader of the Opposition said no.,42
NA,Their commitment is that they won't be,42
NA,putting tax rates up or changing tax and they,42
NA,won't be cutting spending. He was asked,42
NA,persistently on Meet the Press whether they,42
NA,would be cutting spending or making program,42
NA,"cuts. He said, 'No, it's just duplication and",42
NA,overlap that I'd be into.',42
NA,Does he think he is talking to complete,42
NA,fools? There are people on this side of the,42
NA,House who have been through 20 budget,42
NA,reviews. If you want to make major changes,42
NA,"to Australian fiscal policy on the outlay side,",42
NA,you have to cut into programs. That is what,42
NA,it means. So he said they are not going to,42
NA,touch programs and they are not going to,42
NA,touch taxation. They will just tippy toe into,42
NA,office. They won't do anything to anybody.,42
NA,They won't touch revenue. They won't touch,42
NA,outlays. They won't touch Medicare. They,42
NA,won't touch the Industrial Relations Commis-,42
NA,"sion; no, they won't stab it. They won't do",43
NA,anything. 'If they will just trust us to get into,43
NA,office'-,43
NA,"Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, I raise a point",43
NA,of order.,43
Mr KEATING,Don't you like the an-,43
NA,swer?,43
NA,"Mr Costello-No, you haven't started the",43
NA,"answer yet; that is your trouble. Mr Speaker,",43
NA,the question was whether the Prime Minister,43
NA,agreed with the Treasurer's statement that it,43
NA,would be foolish to rule out new taxes if,43
NA,Labor is re-elected at the next election. The,43
NA,question goes to the Prime Minister's secret,43
NA,tax agenda. He has not addressed this in the,43
NA,slightest. I ask you to direct him to be rel-,43
NA,evant to that question.,43
Mr SPEAKER,The Prime Minister was,43
NA,asked a question about fiscal policy. He is,43
NA,responding.,43
NA,"Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, on a point of",43
NA,order: he was not asked a general question,43
NA,about coalition intentions or fiscal policy. He,43
NA,was asked a question about his tax agenda.,43
Mr SPEAKER,Order! There is no point,43
NA,of order. Resume your seat. The Prime,43
NA,Minister has the call.,43
Mr KEATING,The general line is: 'You,43
NA,know our policies and you know the team.',43
NA,"Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, further to the",43
NA,point of order raised by the Deputy Leader of,43
NA,"the Opposition, could I refer you to a ruling",43
NA,by Speaker Cope-,43
Mr KEATING,"Oh, by all means; by all",43
NA,means!,43
NA,Mr Abbott-talking about ministers who,43
NA,persisted in spreading misinformation about,43
NA,the opposition. On 2 August 1974 Speaker,43
NA,Cope said that the minister was 'not entitled,43
NA,to talk about the remarks of the right honour-,43
NA,able gentleman that has nothing to do with his,43
NA,portfolio'. He went on to say:,43
NA,The Minister is not responsible for what other,43
NA,people say. He is responsible for giving infonnation,43
NA,conceming his own department. He is not respon-,43
NA,sible for what anybody in another Party says.,43
NA,And he ruled the minister out of order. I put,43
NA,"it to you, Mr Speaker, that standing order 142",43
NA,and standing order 145 mean that the Prime,43
NA,Minister and other ministers are simply not,43
NA,entitled to blackguard the opposition in the,43
NA,guise of answering questions about the,43
NA,government. I urge you to uphold the ruling,43
NA,of Speaker Cope.,43
Mr SPEAKER,There is no point of,43
NA,order. I invite the honourable member to have,43
NA,a look at a statement which I made in this,43
NA,place which amplified previous rulings of,43
NA,speakers in respect of the matters he has,43
NA,raised.,43
Mr KEATING,The general opposition,43
NA,position on fiscal policy and all these policies,43
NA,is: 'You know the team and you know what,43
NA,"our views are.' In other words, 'We won't go",43
NA,saying expressly what we'll do; you know,43
NA,philosophically where we are coming from.',43
NA,That is what he thinks will constitute a,43
NA,mandate were he to win an election. In,43
NA,"America, in a quite old-fashioned way Newt",43
NA,"Gingrich, Senator Dole and others actually put",43
NA,a program to the people of the United States,43
NA,upon which a very large Republican majority,43
NA,in both houses of the Congress was won.,43
NA,The Leader of the Opposition is saying: 'I,43
NA,will not put revenue up. I won't cut spending.,43
NA,I won't do anything to offend anybody.' Then,43
NA,he will want to claim he has a mandate. On,43
NA,this side of the House we have made the point,43
NA,over and over that this is the second lowest,43
NA,taxed country in the Western world. The,43
NA,Treasurer said today that we would broadly,43
NA,maintain the present level of tax. The present,43
NA,"level of tax is forecast at 23 per cent of GDP,",43
NA,"in 1994-95. In 1983-84, when the government",43
NA,"came to office-in a recession, when tax",43
NA,revenue had been badly hit-it was 23.1 per,43
NA,cent of GDP. So it was 23.1 per cent of GDP,43
NA,when the government came to office and it is,43
NA,"23 per cent now, after the government has",43
NA,been in office in that period.,43
NA,So when the Treasurer says that we would,43
NA,broadly maintain the present level of tax-it,43
NA,varies according to the economic cycle-in,43
NA,essence he is referring to no more than those,43
NA,very pertinent statistics and giving me the,43
NA,opportunity to remind the House that Austral-,43
NA,ia is the second lowest taxed country among,43
NA,Western developed countries.,43
NA,Contrast that record with the cheap commit-,43
NA,ments of the opposition. The Leader of the,43
NA,Opposition is determined not to actually put,44
NA,a firm statement down on anything. He,44
NA,saying that he will not lift taxation or,44
NA,ual taxes and he will not cut spending.,44
NA,"other words, he will give up all of the instruaverage",44
NA,ments on fiscal policy and wish to be bea,44
NA,"lieved on it, and then when he gets asked",44
NA,persistently about any other matters-Medicent,44
NA,"care, wages, the Industrial Relations Commis-",44
NA,"sion-no, he will not touch anything. 'If you",44
NA,will just let us tippy toe into office we,44
NA,then set up shop and our mandate will be:,44
NA,"""You know what we have always had in per",44
NA,"mind""-not our written word, not our stated",44
NA,word.' That is not a mandate. The Leader of,44
NA,the Opposition will then say: 'People know,44
NA,where we are coming from. They know what,44
NA,"our views are.' Yes, we know what their",44
NA,views are-$10 billion of cuts in government,44
NA,spending; that is what you are on the record,44
NA,as supporting-and introducing a state income,44
NA,tax and state consumption taxes. There are,44
NA,things that you are really on about.,44
NA,The deputy over here in some interview lows:,44
NA,"with someone from the BRW, sitting down as",44
NA,"if they had given him some sort of truth drug,",44
NA,"and out it all popped: 'Yes, we are going to",44
NA,"hop into the vertical fiscal imbalance, which",44
NA,means we are going to give taxing powers to,44
NA,the states.' One thing is for certain: when,44
NA,John Howard says he won't lift tax and he,44
NA,"won't cut government spending, don't believe",44
NA,him. Because what he will do,44
NA,opposite. The government's position is this.,44
NA,Here are the numbers: tax revenue to,44
NA,"1983-84, 23.1 per cent compared to 23 per",44
NA,cent for this year. I will leave our case on that,44
NA,point.,44
NA,Pensioners,44
Mr GRIFFIN,Has the Prime Minister,44
NA,seen reports today concerning the treatment of,44
NA,pensioners in Australia? What is the gov-,44
NA,ernment's response to those reports? Is it the,44
NA,intention of the government to continue to,44
NA,ensure that Australian pensioners get a fair,44
NA,deal from the government?,44
Mr KEATING,Before the government,44
NA,"came to office pensions were not indexed,",44
NA,"certainly not twice yearly as they are now,",44
NA,and they were not adjusted in a discretionary,44
NA,way by further commitments by the govern-,44
NA,ment off the budget to the pension system and,44
NA,"is to pensioners. As a result, pensions were",44
NA,individaround 22-odd per cent of average weekly,44
NA,In earnings. They are now at 25.7 per cent of,44
NA,weekly earnings. The government had,44
NA,target of getting pensions to 25 per cent of,44
NA,average weekly earnings. They are at 25.7 per,44
NA,of average weekly earnings.,44
NA,When the opposition leader was last in,44
NA,"office, the real value of pensions fell by two",44
NA,"will per cent. In fact, when the Whitlam govern-",44
NA,"ment came to office, pensions were below 20",44
NA,cent of average weekly earnings. It was a,44
NA,commitment of the Whitlam government to,44
NA,"bring them to 25 per cent, which brought into",44
NA,the public domain that commitment by Labor.,44
NA,I think it proves one point: when Labor,44
NA,"governments are elected, age pensions go up;",44
NA,"when coalition governments are elected, age",44
NA,pensions go down. That has been the accu-,44
NA,"rate, historical fact. Yesterday, the Leader of",44
NA,the the Opposition during an interview was asked,44
NA,about pensions. The interview went as fol-,44
NA,John Howard: Pensions?,44
NA,"Michelle Grattan: Yes, would you retain them?",44
NA,Compere: Age pensions.,44
NA,John Howard: Absolute iron clad retention.,44
NA,Michelle Grattan: Twenty-five per cent of aver-,44
NA,age weekly earnings?,44
NA,"John Howard: Well, well, we are going to retain",44
NA,is just the the present system.,44
NA,He prides himself on being tricky with words.,44
NA,"GDP, The compere comes back and says:",44
NA,The present system is 25 per cent of average,44
NA,weekly earnings. It is not simply adjusting them to,44
NA,CPI. That is the commitment?,44
NA,John Howard: Well we retain the adjustment to,44
NA,cpr and-,44
NA,Michelle Grattan: And the 25 per cent?,44
NA,John Howard: Well the 25 per cent is a goal of,44
NA,the government's.,44
NA,"That is, not any government he might lead-",44
NA,"our government. In other words, he has slid",44
NA,by without making the commitment. Mr,44
NA,"Speaker, you might recall that the Leader of",44
NA,the Opposition recently made a speech to,44
NA,ACOSS where he made it clear again that the,44
NA,only commitment would be the adjustment of,44
NA,the pension to the CPI-and nothing more.,44
NA,What needs to be understood is that if we,44
NA,"assume that average weekly earnings increase,",45
NA,"say, by around one per cent a year-and",45
NA,recently they have been going up by more,45
NA,than 1Y2 per cent a year-over 10 years the,45
NA,pension would be 10 per cent higher in real,45
NA,terms than if you just maintained its real,45
NA,value.,45
NA,"In other words, the commitment to giving",45
NA,the pension a relationship to average weekly,45
NA,earnings means not just an adjustment in real,45
NA,"terms to maintain it, but to let it grow along",45
NA,with the rest of the work force so its relative,45
NA,purchasing power is improved. So if you have,45
NA,"real increases in wages, meaning above the",45
NA,"inflation rate, you get real increases in the",45
NA,pension. That is what he will not commit to.,45
NA,Then with the high cynicism he learned from,45
NA,"Mr Carrick and others, he stuck a statement",45
NA,out in the afternoon-,45
Mr HOWARD ,It is John Carrick now?,45
Mr KEATING,He taught you most of,45
NA,your dirty tricks. Mr Howard said:,45
NA,It is clear and absolute Coalition policy-,45
NA,that was after I put out a statement-,45
NA,both to index pensions on a twice-yearly basis ...,45
NA,and as well maintain their value at 25 per cent of,45
NA,average weekly earnings.,45
NA,"In the interview, when pressed, he said:",45
NA,"Well, well, we are going to retain the present",45
NA,system.,45
NA,When asked whether that was not simply,45
NA,adjusted in the CPI he repeated:,45
NA,we retain the adjustment to CPI-,45
NA,"Then, he got a third go. He said:",45
NA,Well the 25 per cent is a goal of the government's.,45
NA,"So, at midday it is not on, but at 5 o'clock it",45
NA,is a policy of the opposition. You must think,45
NA,the gallery are the greatest bunch of dodos,45
NA,"and fools, the greatest bunch of naive clots,",45
NA,that have ever graced the portals of this,45
NA,parliament-to believe this sort of rubbish,45
NA,that you would push out at 5 o'clock in the,45
NA,afternoon when you have had a chance to go,45
NA,"with a considered statement to ACOSS, where",45
NA,you gave notice for weeks that you were,45
NA,going to make the big wasteland speech at,45
NA,"ACOSS. Then, when you got to ACOSS,",45
NA,what did you say about pensions? You said,45
NA,you would only maintain them with the CPI.,45
NA,There was no mention of average weekly,45
NA,earnings.,45
NA,In your declaratory main statement to the,45
NA,"peak welfare body, was there any mention of",45
NA,25 per cent of average weekly earnings? No,45
NA,way. Was there any mention of it yesterday?,45
NA,"No way. When pressed three times, did you",45
NA,commit yourself to it? No way. But when you,45
NA,felt the heat of understanding what the,45
NA,"government's commitment was, you put out",45
NA,this press statement saying that you will,45
NA,"maintain it. If anyone believes that, they will",45
NA,believe in fairies at the bottom of the garden.,45
NA,I make this point again to all those pension-,45
NA,"ers, particularly those in the demographic",45
NA,group who have a tendency to support the,45
NA,coalition: John Howard will cut the real value,45
NA,of your pension. John Howard will cut the,45
NA,relative purchasing power of your pension. He,45
NA,"has proven it. If he gets into office, he will",45
NA,"say, 'You know the team. You know where",45
NA,we have come from. Look at my speech to,45
NA,ACOSS.' Was there any mention of 25 per,45
NA,cent of average weekly earnings? Someone,45
NA,"will say, ' Mr Howard, you put out a statement",45
NA,on 26 November 1995 that said it.' He will,45
NA,"say, 'Look at our main speech to ACOSS.",45
NA,Look at the things that I have said on the,45
NA,record.' That is the game that the Leader of,45
NA,the Opposition is playing.,45
NA,I hope that every pensioner organisation in,45
NA,"Australia knows that, as a consequence of the",45
NA,"government's policy, if this government had",45
NA,adjusted pensions by the consumer price,45
NA,"index, single pensioners would be $20 a week",45
NA,worse and couples would be $34 a week,45
NA,worse off. So I ask pensioners to consider,45
NA,"whether, were Mr Howard to be Prime Minis-",45
NA,"ter, they could stand the loss of $20 a week",45
NA,as a single pensioner or $34 a week as a,45
NA,pensioner couple. They are the sorts of poli-,45
NA,cies that he presided over when Treasurer and,45
NA,they are the policies that he is still committed,45
NA,to.,45
NA,Taxation,45
Mr COSTELLO,My question is directed,45
NA,to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime,45
NA,Minister that before the last election he,45
NA,"legislated income tax cuts. After the election,",45
NA,he increased wholesale sales tax on all items,45
NA,"by two per cent, increased wine tax, increased",46
NA,"petrol tax by 5c and 7c per litre, increased",46
NA,company tax by three per cent and abolished,46
NA,the l-a-w tax cuts which would otherwise be,46
NA,payable in five weeks on 1 January 1996.,46
NA,Since it is clear that you now have in mind,46
NA,"introducing new taxes if re-elected, what new",46
NA,taxes do you have in mind?,46
Mr KEATING,What I made very clear,46
NA,in the run-up to the 1993 election-you might,46
NA,remember that we discussed this issue on Mr,46
NA,O'Brien's Lateline program-was that the,46
NA,government would be keeping revenue to,46
NA,GDP at about the levels which then obtained.,46
NA,I have been through that issue in the House,46
NA,on a number of occasions. Let me give you,46
NA,the numbers again. Revenue to GDP is at 23,46
NA,per cent. It is exactly where it was in the,46
NA,"recession year of 1983-84. In other words,",46
NA,"over the period of the government's life, we",46
NA,still have around 23 per cent of revenue to,46
NA,GDP. That is the position.,46
NA,The government did not make commitments,46
NA,of the kind which those opposite are now,46
NA,making and foolishly believe that people will,46
NA,"accept; that is, that they will not increase tax",46
NA,rates or change the tax system in any way. Do,46
NA,you think people are complete mugs when,46
NA,you tell them that sort of stuff? That is what,46
NA,you think.,46
NA,Under the commitments which the govern-,46
NA,"ment is now to legislate, in respect of having",46
NA,paid the first round of the tax cuts and the,46
NA,second round of their superannuation ac-,46
NA,"counts, the totality is greater than the quantum",46
NA,of the One Nation tax cuts announced in the,46
NA,"One Nation statement in 1992. In other words,",46
NA,we are paying taxpayers back more than what,46
NA,we said we would in the One Nation state-,46
NA,ment of 1992. That is the government's,46
NA,record. The fact that we remain the second,46
NA,lowest taxed country in the OECD makes it,46
NA,very clear that we in Australia are running a,46
NA,relatively small public sector very efficiently.,46
NA,We have outlays to GDP in trend terms at,46
NA,around 25 per cent of GDP and revenue at,46
NA,around 23 per cent of GDP.,46
NA,"They are the sorts of figures which, as I",46
NA,"indicated to the House some time ago, are up",46
NA,in lights as the sorts of numbers which are,46
NA,regarded as part of the convergence criteria,46
NA,"for the European monetary system. Of course,",46
NA,most of the countries you would like to,46
NA,identify us with would not qualify but Aus-,46
NA,"tralia would, and that is because of this sort",46
NA,of outcome. When the Leader of the Opposi-,46
NA,tion goes around saying he will not cut,46
NA,government spending and he will not change,46
NA,"or increase tax rates, do not believe him.",46
NA,Pensioners,46
Ms DEAHM,My question is addressed to,46
NA,the Minister for Social Security. I refer to the,46
NA,government's commitment to maintaining the,46
NA,pension at 25 per cent of average weekly,46
NA,earnings. What effect does such a commit-,46
NA,ment have on pensioners?,46
Mr BALDWIN,I can inform the House,46
NA,that the government has retained its commit-,46
NA,ment to keeping the pension at or above 25,46
NA,per cent of average weekly earnings. That is,46
NA,one of a number of key social benchmarks,46
NA,that the government has adopted over the,46
NA,"years. In fact, we have had that as an objec-",46
NA,tive for some considerable time. We have,46
NA,been able to achieve that benchmark since,46
NA,1990 and to equal or exceed it ever since.,46
NA,"That is very significant. By contrast, during",46
NA,the period of the coalition government the,46
NA,pension was allowed to drift down to 22.7 per,46
NA,cent of average weekly earnings and there,46
NA,was a two per cent real reduction in the,46
NA,pension rate.,46
NA,It is very important to bear in mind the,46
NA,nature of a commitment of that sort and set it,46
NA,against the sorts of statements that emanate,46
NA,from the opposition about what it claims it,46
NA,can do on the fiscal policy front. Those,46
NA,opposite have made statements implying that,46
NA,they can take around $10 billion off outlays.,46
NA,The Leader of the Opposition gave a state-,46
NA,ment in his address to ACOSS and said that,46
NA,he would not take $10 billion off the social,46
NA,safety net. There is no ambiguity about the,46
NA,implication of the opposition's policy. It says,46
NA,it would get the budget into surplus without,46
NA,"asset sales. On the adjusted ABS definition,",46
NA,that implies a $10 billion cut in outlays.,46
NA,To give some idea of what maintaining the,46
NA,sort of commitment that the government has,46
NA,"on pensions implies in terms of outlays, on 22",46
NA,September this year the government increased,46
NA,the base pension for single people by $9.80,47
NA,a fortnight and for each member of a married,47
NA,couple by $8.20 a fortnight. That adjustment,47
NA,to the pension was made on 22 September,47
NA,"this year. The budgetary cost of that, when",47
NA,you take into account flow-oTIS to other,47
NA,"payments, was around $800 million in a full",47
NA,year. That is the sort of commitment on the,47
NA,outlay side that is required in order to main-,47
NA,tain that sort of commitment.,47
NA,After a stumblebum performance by the,47
NA,"Leader of the Opposition on Sunday, in a",47
NA,situation where he had given no commitment,47
NA,"on that 25 per cent issue, he issued a press",47
NA,lease at 5 o'clock yesterday saying that he,47
NA,would. How on earth are the opposition going,47
NA,to reconcile the achievement of that sort of,47
NA,social policy objective with the sorts of state-,47
NA,ments they have made on fiscal policy? This,47
NA,is something that arises time and again and,47
NA,which they refuse to address in any coherent,47
NA,or sensible way. If you look at the perform-,47
NA,ance of this government compared with that,47
NA,of the coalition in terms of the social safety,47
NA,"net, you see that the record under us has been",47
NA,consistent real improvements whereas the,47
NA,record under the coalition has been consistent,47
NA,real declines. If we had done no more than,47
NA,"index the pension since we came into office,",47
NA,a single pensioner would be getting from $20,47
NA,per week less and a married couple would be,47
NA,getting from $34 per week less. The reality is,47
NA,that there is no coherency or sense in the,47
NA,coalition's statements in these areas. There is,47
NA,no reason that the pensioners of this country,47
NA,could have to believe any commitments,47
NA,coming from the coalition. Their record is the,47
NA,diametrical opposite of maintenance and,47
NA,improvement of that safety net. That is a,47
NA,direct and very clear contrast with the actual,47
NA,performance of this government.,47
NA,Pensioners,47
Mr RUDDOCK,My question is directed,47
NA,to the Prime Minister. In 1989 the Labor,47
NA,"government first promised, and renewed at",47
NA,"Bankstown before the 1993 election, to",47
NA,completely remove all age pensioners from,47
NA,the tax system by 1995. Less than a week,47
NA,after the 1993 election that promise was with-,47
NA,drawn by your then Treasurer Mr Dawkins,47
NA,who said he did not feel bound by it. Why are,47
NA,"age pensioners still paying tax? Secondly, I",47
NA,refer the Prime Minister to his government's,47
NA,lowering of the eligibility threshold for family,47
NA,payments since the last federal election.,47
NA,Considering that the change led to some,47
NA,"estimated $118,000 families losing their basic",47
NA,"family payment, why were they not told of",47
NA,the change as part of Labor's policy prior to,47
NA,the 1993 election? Why should anybody,47
NA,believe a word the Prime Minister is saying,47
NA,"concerning social policy, given his complete",47
NA,deception of pensioners and families?,47
Mr KEATING,I suppose if you have,47
NA,rebeen here for 20 years in opposition you have,47
NA,got to get your kicks somehow. Is the mem-,47
NA,ber really seriously trying to suggest-,47
Mr TUCKEY ,Answer the question.,47
NA,MrKEATING-We have heard from the,47
NA,"real genius on the comer over there, Mr",47
NA,Speaker. He interjected. Does the questioner,47
NA,"really contend, in the implication of his",47
NA,"question, that there have not been huge",47
NA,increases-massive increases-to low income,47
NA,families since the government has been in,47
NA,office?,47
Mr TUCKEY ,Come on! Give us the an-,47
NA,swer.,47
Mr SPEAKER,Order!,47
Mr KEATING,There have been massive,47
NA,"increases in rent assistance, additional family",47
NA,payment and the family allowance supple-,47
NA,ment. Many times in the House both the,47
NA,Minister for Social Security and I have been,47
NA,through the numbers about the huge increases,47
NA,in allowances under this government.,47
NA,"Mrs Gallus-What about your promise,",47
NA,Paul?,47
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The member for,47
NA,Hindmarsh!,47
Mr KEATING,The last one I gave was,47
NA,a few minutes ago about the basic rate of,47
NA,pension. The basic rate of pension came from,47
NA,22-odd per cent of average weekly earnings,47
NA,to 25.7.,47
NA,Mr Ruddock-You said 'all pensioners'.,47
Mr SPEAKER,Order!,47
Mr KEATING,It is worth to a pensioner,47
NA,$20 a week-$34 a week to a pensioner,47
NA,couple-or weren't you listening? On this,47
NA,"question about the tax system, as a result of",48
NA,"the government's policies, two-thirds of",48
NA,pensioners-all those on the full rate of,48
NA,pension-have been freed of tax liability,48
NA,completely since July 1990. Not only did the,48
NA,government increase the threshold-the free,48
NA,area-within which pensioners can earn but,48
NA,we have removed it completely from the tax,48
NA,system. At the time when Mr Howard was,48
NA,"Treasurer, under the coalition government, not",48
NA,only was there a miserable free area-,48
NA,"Mrs Gallus-You are stumbling a lot,",48
NA,Paul!,48
Mr KEATING,where some additional,48
NA,income could be earned without someone,48
NA,"losing any pension, but when pensioners",48
NA,earned additional income they were taxed on,48
NA,it. Now they are not taxed on it.,48
NA,Mrs Gallus-And they are still paying tax.,48
Mr SPEAKER,Order! I warn the member,48
NA,for Hindmarsh!,48
Mr KEATING,You can still have a full,48
NA,"pension, with a generous increase in the free",48
NA,"area, and not pay one dollar in tax.",48
NA,Mr Ruddock-That wasn't the promise.,48
Mr SPEAKER,Order!,48
Mr KEATING,When Mr Howard was,48
NA,Treasurer full pensioners were taxed fully on,48
NA,the income above the threshold. There were,48
NA,two things about that. Because you had such,48
NA,"a miserable free area, not only would they",48
NA,lose part of their full pension by any modest,48
NA,increase in earnings-say from superannuation,48
NA,"or from deposits they had in a bank-but, as",48
NA,"well as that, you would actually tax the",48
NA,earnings in the free area. People opposite,48
NA,have the hide to ask me that question. That is,48
NA,their record. They must have a sort of front,48
NA,school in the Liberal Party to learn how you,48
NA,can say the most embarrassing things and not,48
NA,be embarrassed. They must run through a,48
NA,course or something. You would have to be,48
NA,psychologically prepared for this sort of thing,48
NA,to be able to ask that sort of,48
NA,body who is a full pensioner now has a,48
NA,generous free area and not one dollar of it is,48
NA,taxed.,48
NA,Medicare,48
Mr HORNE,My question is to the Prime,48
NA,"Minister, and it concerns Medicare. Does the",48
NA,"government remain committed to Medicare,",48
NA,and what steps is the government taking to,48
NA,ensure that our health system meets the needs,48
NA,of all Australians?,48
Mr KEATING,The Labor Party have,48
NA,long believed-,48
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,48
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The Prime Minis-,48
NA,ter will wait for a minute. I again today,48
NA,remind people of standing order 55: ministers,48
NA,are entitled to be heard-and they will be.,48
Mr KEATING,The Labor Party have,48
NA,always believed that part of the social fabric,48
NA,of Australia should be the right to universality,48
NA,in health protection. But we do not regard it,48
NA,as something that the market might give you.,48
NA,"We regard it as a social right. If you get sick,",48
NA,"you are entitled to be looked after. It is not,",48
NA,'If you get sick and you have got money you,48
NA,"are entitled to be looked after,' but, 'If you",48
NA,get sick you are entitled to be looked after.',48
NA,"This, of course, the coalition have never be-",48
NA,lieved. They believe you are only entitled to,48
NA,health protection if you can pay for it. That,48
NA,is their basic position.,48
NA,I again go back to the Leader of the,48
NA,Opposition's Meet the Press interview yester-,48
NA,day. He had a right little blow-out on Meet,48
NA,the Press yesterday. He said:,48
NA,I don't accept for a moment that we went to the,48
NA,last election as Paul Keating alleges promising to,48
NA,"abolish Medicare; that is wrong, we didn't.",48
NA,He said that with intonation and meaning. The,48
NA,Fightback changes included Medicare for,48
NA,pensioners and card holders only and bulk-,48
NA,billing abolished for Medicare except for,48
NA,welfare recipients. If that is not the destruc-,48
NA,"tion of Medicare, what is? If that is not the",48
NA,"destruction of the universality of the system,",48
NA,what is? That was only three years ago. That,48
NA,has followed the general views he has put,48
NA,over the period. When he was leader he said:,48
NA,The Medicare system is a total disaster. We will be,48
NA,proposing changes to Medicare that amount to its,48
NA,question. Everyde facto dismantling.,48
NA,The questioner said:,48
NA,You will pull it right apart?,48
NA,And he said:,49
NA,"Yes, we will pull it right apart.",49
NA,I would have thought that was plain enough.,49
NA,That is his view. It has always been his view.,49
NA,But there was more of it. He said:,49
NA,The second thing we will do is we will get rid of,49
NA,"the bulk-billing system, it is an absolute rart.",49
NA,"I would have thought that, if you are going to",49
NA,pull it apart and dismantle it and get rid of,49
NA,"the bulk-billing system because it is a rort,",49
NA,what you really mean to do is hop into,49
NA,Medicare. So the questioner-it was actually,49
NA,Mr Laws-says to him:,49
NA,... so really what you are saying is what you,49
NA,do is take us back to how things were pre-,49
NA,Medicare?,49
NA,The reply was:,49
NA,"As best we can, yes, recognising that in a society",49
NA,"you never go completely back, but I would love to",49
NA,go back.,49
NA,What he would like to do is really go back.,49
NA,"We know where back means. It is about 1953,",49
NA,in the dreamtime of his political life. The fact,49
NA,"is: basically what he means is, 'Medicare is",49
NA,a total disaster. We will propose changes that,49
NA,amount to its de facto dismantling. We will,49
NA,pull it right apart. We will get rid of bulk-billbottom,49
NA,ing. It is a rort. And we will go back to pre-,49
NA,Medicare.' That is his position. It is all out,49
NA,there in his health policy. In 1987 he says he,49
NA,will allow opting out of the Medicare arrange-,49
NA,"ments, abolish bulk-billing and says that",49
NA,Medicare is a failure. What he says on Meet,49
NA,the Press is not what he says when asked:,49
NA,"But, Mr Howard, you have not put ail your policies",49
NA,in the marketplace.,49
NA,He says:,49
NA,People know where we stand. They know who the,49
NA,team will be.,49
NA,"In other words-wink, wink-'We'll be there,",49
NA,"where we have always been, for our old,",49
NA,long-run position to policies.' The long-run,49
NA,position to policies is to smash Medicare.,49
NA,That has always been his position. Then he,49
NA,was contesting yesterday that the Fraser,49
NA,government did not abolish Medicare. In fact,49
NA,"what Mr Fraser said is, 'We are going to",49
NA,maintain the Medibank scheme. The scheme,49
NA,will continue as it was introduced.' That is,49
NA,pretty much almost word for word. Mr How-,49
NA,ard said:,49
NA,A lot of people will say that the changes Fraser,49
NA,made did not amount to dismantling Medicare ...,49
NA,He thinks he is good with the words. He,49
NA,thinks the media and the public will not,49
NA,understand what he is in fact saying. There is,49
NA,only one party that will keep universality of,49
NA,"health protection in Australia, and that is the",49
NA,Labor Party. That is the only party that will,49
NA,"keep health protection as a common right, as",49
NA,a public right in this country. What would,49
NA,happen under a Howard government is that,49
NA,they would go back to a two-tiered medical,49
NA,will system: the well-heeled system for the weal-,49
NA,thy and basically public squalor for those who,49
NA,might somehow pay to keep a toehold in it.,49
NA,But the whole question of universality would,49
NA,go.,49
NA,I told the House not long ago about what,49
NA,sorts of funds are involved in a rebate system,49
NA,for private health insurance of the kind the,49
NA,"Leader of the Opposition espouses. Of course,",49
NA,this is the sort of money that would hit the,49
NA,budget. But of course he will not touch tax,49
NA,"and he will not touch outlays, so I do not",49
NA,know what he is going to do to the budget,49
NA,line other than poke a hole in it.,49
NA,"Again, with private health fund reserves",49
NA,"over $1.6 billion now, why would the Leader",49
NA,of the Opposition decide to give another,49
NA,billion dollars to the private health system?,49
NA,But that is what he wants to do. He is not,49
NA,interested in the public health system; he is,49
NA,interested in the private health system. He is,49
NA,interested in basically the gold-plated private,49
NA,"system for the people he thinks he represents,",49
NA,and he is interested in public squalor for the,49
NA,rest of Australia.,49
NA,"Mr Speaker, the public of Australia should",49
NA,rest assured on these things: when John,49
NA,"Howard says he will maintain Medicare, don't",49
NA,believe him. The only party that will maintain,49
NA,Medicare and keep it growing is of course the,49
NA,government.,49
NA,Minister for Human Services and Health,49
Mr HOWARD,I direct a question to the,49
NA,Prime Minister about believability. When the,49
NA,cabinet was deciding whether or not to use,49
NA,taxpayers' money in an attempt to stop the,49
NA,truth about the Minister for Human Services,50
NA,"and Health emerging, did you disclose to the",50
NA,cabinet the inside information you had on the,50
NA,"case from Labor leader, Jim MCGinty, or did",50
NA,you cover it up? And is it a fact that the real,50
NA,reason you tried to stop the royal commission,50
NA,"going ahead-in other words, the real reason",50
NA,you tried to cover up the truth-was that you,50
NA,knew beforehand that Carmen Lawrence was,50
NA,lying?,50
Mr KEATING,"Is that in order, Mr",50
NA,Speaker?,50
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,50
Mr SPEAKER,Order! Those on my left!,50
NA,The Prime Minister has been asked a ques-,50
NA,tion. The last section of that has in fact been,50
NA,used in questions in this place in recent times.,50
NA,"I am allowing it on that basis only, and I give",50
NA,an opportunity for the Prime Minister to,50
NA,respond accordingly.,50
Mr KEATING,The fact that Mr MCGinty,50
NA,told me-as the Minister for Human Services,50
NA,and Health had earlier told me-that some of,50
NA,her colleagues had a different view and,50
NA,recollection of this-,50
NA,Opposition members-All!,50
Mr KEATING,"No, not all of them.",50
NA,Mr Costello-All who testified.,50
Mr KEATING,"No, no, they did not.",50
Mr SPEAKER,Order! Those on my left.,50
Mr KEATING,Had a different view of,50
"this, Mr SPEAKER ",,50
NA,"Mr Costello-MCGinty, Keith Wilson-",50
NA,Mr MCGauran-John Kobelke.,50
Mr KEATING,"Yes, a lot of the old",50
NA,Burke squad-they were there.,50
NA,"Mr Costello-Oh, that is good. Here is the",50
NA,truth.,50
NA,Opposition members-Oh! Oh!,50
Mr SPEAKER,Order! I will get some,50
NA,quiet. Just one moment. Those on my left! I,50
NA,have allowed the question from the Leader of,50
NA,the Opposition and I am asking for the provi-,50
NA,sions of standing order 55 to be observed.,50
NA,"The Prime Minister has the call, and he will",50
NA,be heard.,50
Mr KEATING,"-His view, that he and",50
NA,others would in the event of a royal commis-,50
NA,sion being established testify or give a par-,50
NA,ticular view which was at odds with the view,50
NA,"he knew that the minister would give, has no",50
NA,bearing whatsoever on whether the important,50
NA,principle of whether the rights and preroga-,50
NA,tives of a member of parliament and a cabinet,50
NA,minister should be basically impugned by the,50
NA,executive arm of government via a royal,50
NA,commission. What you have all signed up to,50
NA,over there is that a royal commission appoint-,50
NA,ed by a government can interfere with your,50
NA,"rights as an MP and, were you to be in office,",50
NA,a minister. That is what you have signed up,50
NA,to. It is just as ridiculous as that which you,50
NA,signed up to in the Senate in 1975 in knock-,50
NA,ing over supply bills. You always break the,50
NA,protocols of Australian public life.,50
Mr HOWARD ,"I take a point of order, Mr",50
NA,Speaker. The question-,50
Mr KEATING,And it had better be one,50
NA,too.,50
Mr HOWARD ,"Oh, it had better be! Oh, we",50
NA,"are a Speaker now too, are we?",50
Mr SPEAKER,Order!,50
Mr HOWARD ,The first Prime Minister/,50
NA,Speaker in Australian politics!,50
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The Leader of the,50
NA,Opposition will address me or he will resume,50
NA,"his seat. I will deal with it, Prime Minister.",50
Mr HOWARD ,He will take the point of,50
NA,order.,50
NA,Mr Keating interjecting-,50
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The Prime,50
NA,"Minister will resume his seat. Prime Minister,",50
NA,I will deal with it. I will take the point. The,50
NA,Leader of the Opposition knows if he has a,50
NA,point of order he addresses it to me.,50
Mr HOWARD ,The point of order is tbat I,50
NA,asked a question directed very specifically as,50
NA,to whether he told the cabinet what MCGinty,50
NA,had told him-,50
Mr SPEAKER,Order! There is no point,50
NA,of order.,50
Mr HOWARD ," Mr Speaker, there is a point",50
NA,of order.,50
Mr SPEAKER,"No, there is not.",50
Mr HOWARD ,Will you hear me out? You,51
NA,have ruled there is no point of order before,51
NA,finished making it. I asked him very specifi-,51
NA,cally whether he had disclosed to the cabinet,51
NA,the conversation with MCGinty and what,51
NA,"MCGinty had told him, and the Prime",51
NA,Minister is deliberately avoiding answering,51
NA,"that question, and it is clear to everybody",51
NA,this House.,51
Mr SPEAKER,Resume your seat! There,51
NA,is no point of order.,51
Mr BEAZLEY ,I take a point of order.,51
Mr SPEAKER,The Leader of the House,51
NA,with a point of order.,51
Mr BEAZLEY ,The point of order goes-,51
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,51
Mr SPEAKER,The leader will be heard.,51
Mr BEAZLEY ,The point of order goes to,51
NA,deliberate disruption and using points of order,51
NA,out of the context in which they ought to be,51
NA,used. The Prime Minister then was directly,51
NA,addressing the position of what discussions,51
NA,ought to take place in cabinet and what ought,51
NA,"to be revealed about them, be it cabinets in",51
NA,Western Australia or cabinets here. It was,51
NA,absolutely on the point of the question. The,51
NA,point of order was simply deliberately disrup-,51
NA,tive of that and ought to be seen as thorough-,51
NA,ly disorderly and dealt with accordingly.,51
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,51
Mr SPEAKER,Order! Those on my left!,51
NA,The Prime Minister was indeed asked a direct,51
NA,question and he was directly responding-,51
NA,directly responding. He will be heard without,51
NA,interruption.,51
Mr KEATING,If the Leader of the,51
NA,Opposition persists in attempting to make a,51
NA,"mockery of you and your judgments, you",51
NA,should name him.,51
NA,"Opposition members-Oh! Ha, hal",51
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The Prime,51
NA,Minister has the call on the question that was,51
NA,"directed to him, and you have heard my",51
NA,warning.,51
Mr KEATING," Mr Speaker, I was entire-",51
NA,ly in order.,51
Mr SPEAKER,Correct.,51
Mr KEATING,And I was directing,51
NA,I myself to the point and the point was-,51
Mr HOWARD ,You slipped on the way.,51
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The Leader of the,51
NA,Opposition! Take the hint.,51
Mr KEATING,The truth is that they did,51
NA,in not like the point. And the point is that the,51
NA,Leader of the Opposition and the Liberal,51
NA,party have put their names to the use by the,51
NA,executive government of royal commissions,51
NA,"which transcend their rights as MPs and,",51
NA,"where appropriate and around the country, as",51
NA,ministers. You have set that up as a result of,51
NA,the Marks royal commission.,51
Mr HOWARD ,I set it up?,51
Mr KEATING,"Yes, you and Court set it",51
NA,up.,51
Mr SPEAKER,The Leader of the Oppo-,51
NA,sition!,51
Mr KEATING,You and Court and your,51
NA,little mate over here who is lying like a pig,51
NA,in mud over the thing.,51
Mr HOWARD ,"Oh, here we go.",51
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The Prime,51
NA,Minister has the call.,51
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,51
Mr SPEAKER,Those on my left! I,51
NA,cannot hear.,51
NA,Opposition members-Withdraw! With-,51
NA,draw!,51
Mr HOWARD ,He should withdraw.,51
Mr KEATING,"That word was in order,",51
NA,I was told earlier.,51
Mr HOWARD ,The difference is that he has,51
NA,not been required-,51
Mr SPEAKER,Order! There will be no,51
NA,debate across the dispatch box. Resume your,51
NA,seat.,51
Mr KEATING, Mr SPEAKER -,51
Mr HOWARD ,"But Mr Speaker, you should",51
NA,make him-,51
Mr SPEAKER,Just one moment. Resume,51
NA,you seat! The Prime Minister has the call. I,51
NA,"do not want interjections. Prime Minister, you",51
NA,will continue your answer.,51
Mr HOWARD ,Withdraw!,51
Mr KEATING,"Oh, you're going to make",52
NA,"me withdraw, are you? You've got Buckley's.",52
Mr HOWARD ," Mr Speaker, he made an",52
NA,unsubstantiated claim of lying against the,52
NA,honourable member for Chisholm and we ask,52
NA,that that be withdrawn.,52
Mr BEAZLEY ," Mr Speaker, on a point of",52
NA,order-,52
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,52
Mr SPEAKER,Order! I will hear this.,52
Mr BEAZLEY ,The point of order is: what,52
NA,is good for the goose is good for the gander.,52
NA,You permitted in the question that was put,52
NA,here the use of a term which had hitherto in,52
NA,the context of a question been unparliamen-,52
NA,"tary. You utilised it, and reasonably so, in",52
NA,context of the course of these discussions that,52
NA,"had been used before and, therefore, it was",52
NA,allowed through. I would have thought that,52
NA,what was good for the goose is good for the,52
NA,gander. And the obviously deliberately,52
NA,misleading activities of the honourable mem-,52
NA,ber opposite when he talks about 'liaising' on,52
NA,that occasion comes thoroughly within that,52
NA,ambit.,52
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The Leader of the,52
NA,"House did say, quite correctly, that in the",52
NA,question that was raised by the Leader of the,52
NA,Opposition unparliamentary language was,52
NA,used. When the Prime Minister queried,52
NA,"whether that was appropriate, I said on the",52
NA,basis that it had been used in here in respect,52
NA,"of this matter and some questions, I was",52
NA,going to give him the opportunity-,52
Mr HOWARD ,This matter.,52
Mr SPEAKER,to respond.,52
Mr HOWARD ,This matter.,52
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The Prime,52
NA,Minister made a general observation-,52
Mr HOWARD ,"Oh, ha, ha!",52
Mr SPEAKER,"No, listen to what I am",52
NA,saying. As far as I am concerned-,52
NA,"Opposition members-Ha, ha!",52
Mr SPEAKER,Order!,52
NA,Mr Downer-Even they think that is,52
NA,funny.,52
Mr SPEAKER,Order! I am going to,52
NA,allow the Prime Minister to continue his,52
NA,response on the basis that it is one each-,52
NA,"Opposition members-Ha, ha!",52
Mr SPEAKER,and the Prime Minister,52
NA,has the call.,52
Mr KEATING ,And I can make it two.,52
Dr WOOLDRIDGE , Mr Speaker?,52
Mr SPEAKER,The honourable member,52
NA,for Chisholm is going to press the issue?,52
Dr WOOLDRIDGE ," Mr Speaker, on a point",52
NA,"of order, I would: this is question time, not",52
NA,"revenge of the spivs. It might be one all, but",52
NA,I would remind you of what the Leader of the,52
NA,House said. He accused me of deliberately,52
NA,"the misleading, and I would like that withdrawn.",52
Mr SPEAKER,The Leader of the House,52
NA,will withdraw that.,52
Mr BEAZLEY ,I withdraw.,52
Mr SPEAKER,The scoreboard is clear.,52
NA,The Prime Minister has the call.,52
Mr KEATING," Mr Speaker, I can add to",52
NA,the score without any difficulties at all if you,52
NA,would like me to.,52
Mr SPEAKER,"No, just get to the answer.",52
Mr KEATING,So what has happened,52
NA,over here is for the most base of political,52
NA,motives-something where there is no ques-,52
NA,"tion of corruption, no question of funds,",52
NA,improper behaviour or impropriety. There was,52
NA,a royal commission mounted by the Liberal,52
NA,"Party of Australia, with the federal opposition",52
NA,conniving with the government of Western,52
NA,Australia to bring terms of reference such that,52
NA,the royal commissioner would be directed,52
NA,towards a finding against the Minister for,52
NA,Human Services and Health.,52
NA,"In so doing, what it has done is left it open",52
NA,to any other government to appoint a royal,52
NA,commission into what they think are their,52
NA,rights and entitlements as members of parlia-,52
NA,ment and as ministers. Can I also let you,52
NA,"recall, Mr Speaker, that the former Justice",52
NA,"Marks, without thinking, actually then sub-",52
NA,poenaed details from cabinet discussions,52
NA,which took place in the period of the former,52
NA,"government. In other words, the Court",52
NA,government has used its executive arm,52
NA,through a royal commissioner to get the,53
NA,cabinet details and discussions of the former,53
NA,government. This is a breach of the way in,53
NA,which the system operates. I hope the Leader,53
NA,"of the Opposition, were I to get into his",53
NA,cabinet discussions about his management of,53
NA,"the tax system in the 1970s and 1980s, were",53
NA,I to tum up the cabinet minute books and the,53
NA,notes and the rest-,53
Mr HOWARD ,Go for your life.,53
Mr KEATING,Go for your life? You are,53
NA,giving me an invitation? You can imagine,53
NA,that they would cry like stuck pigs.,53
NA,Mr Nehl-Picking on pigs again.,53
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The member for,53
NA,Cowper is not helping.,53
Mr KEATING,This would be a denial of,53
NA,justice under the Westminster system. This,53
NA,"would be absolutely shocking. Only they, the",53
NA,"proper people, know what is right and proper",53
NA,"in the federation and we, the scallywags on",53
NA,"the Labor side, have hopped into a former",53
NA,"cabinet's business, but you do not mind doing",53
NA,"it yourself, and you have made a cardinal",53
NA,error in establishing this royal commission.,53
NA,"Worse than that, after you establish it and",53
NA,you want to transcend the rights of MPs to,53
NA,present petitions and ministers to consider,53
NA,"these matters in the context of a cabinet, you",53
NA,then want to deny the minister the right to,53
NA,"defend herself at law. In other words, you do",53
NA,not want to even see the adjudication of the,53
NA,principles at law. They compound the inde-,53
NA,"cency, the political stupidity, of setting this up",53
NA,by then saying that the minister had no right,53
NA,to defend herself and that the Commonwealth,53
NA,"should not support her defence, on behalf of",53
NA,"all MPs. In other words, the government of",53
NA,the Commonwealth of Australia should not,53
NA,defend the principles against the government,53
NA,of Western Australia. That is essentially what,53
NA,you are saying.,53
NA,How you think that in some way you have,53
NA,"got any justice, a modicum of justice, on your",53
NA,side in that argument and then try to warp,53
NA,another one into it-because the Leader of the,53
NA,Opposition told me something of what he,53
NA,might say before a royal commission yet to be,53
NA,established-and that that in some way,53
NA,compromises that principle has got me beat.,53
NA,You have asked some stupid questions in here,53
NA,"in your day, but that one has no internal logic",53
NA,whatsoever. Whether an opposition leader has,53
NA,"a view about these things, or somebody else,",53
NA,is beside the point.,53
NA,The cabinet decided to support the minister,53
NA,in the defence of important principles in the,53
NA,"Westminster style of government, and that is",53
NA,what it has done. The Liberal Party in its,53
NA,spite now wants to deny that funding. What,53
NA,it wants to do is to track the minister down,53
NA,"with a $5 million royal commission, deny her",53
NA,the chance to defend herself in front of the,53
NA,courts and then deny the funding for her,53
NA,defence. It takes a lot of mean-spiritedness to,53
NA,"get to that point, but that is where the Liberal",53
NA,Party is. No such mean-spiritedness exists on,53
NA,this side of the House. We have not chased,53
NA,MPs around in private life in other states as,53
NA,you have.,53
NA,Mr Costello-Ian Sinclair?,53
Mr KEATING,He was a member of this,53
NA,chamber. What the Liberal Party should,53
NA,understand is that it has created a precedent,53
NA,here-,53
NA,Mr Costello-Frank Walker can tell you.,53
Mr HOWARD ,Look what you did to him.,53
Mr SPEAKER,Order!,53
Mr KEATING,You little wrecker of the,53
NA,"conventions, you. You have created a prece-",53
NA,"dent here and, let me tell you, you will all",53
NA,regret it.,53
NA,Medicare,53
NA,Mr MARTYN EV ANS-My question is,53
NA,directed to the Minister for Human Services,53
NA,and Health. I refer to reports of dramatic,53
NA,"funding cuts to health services in Victoria,",53
NA,Western Australia and particularly my own,53
NA,state of South Australia. Is the minister able,53
NA,to explain to the House if these funding cuts,53
NA,are consistent with the Commonwealth,53
NA,"government's health strategy? If not, why",53
NA,not?,53
Dr LAWRENCE,I thank the member for,53
NA,"his question, because it is on a matter of great",53
NA,concern to the people of Australia. Any time,53
NA,Australians are asked about issues that they,53
NA,"want addressed at the next election, one of the",53
NA,things they mention is health. From the,53
NA,"opposition they have had short shrift, a",54
NA,repeating of some lines like a mantra but no,54
NA,detail. Leaders opposite clearly do not under-,54
NA,stand what the people of Australia understand:,54
NA,"that is, part of the Medicare commitment is",54
NA,not just about retaining the name and making,54
NA,references to bulk-billing but actually ensur-,54
NA,ing decent funding of public hospitals,54
NA,throughout Australia.,54
NA,The member will well know that what we,54
NA,have seen in South Australia is the so-called,54
NA,two-pronged approach of most of the Liberal,54
NA,governments. The first thing they do is cut,54
NA,funding absolutely and then they privatise and,54
NA,contract out the rest of it.,54
NA,being seen. They are totally against the spirit,54
NA,and the commitment of Medicare. Yet we do,54
NA,not have any mention of it from the opposi-,54
NA,tion.,54
Mr TUCKEY ,Look what was done at the,54
NA,Hollywood Repatriation Hospital.,54
Mr SPEAKER,I warn the member for,54
NA,O'Connor!,54
Dr LAWRENCE,"Health funding is often,",54
NA,"and people would understand this, a source of",54
NA,some confusion due to the dual roles of the,54
NA,Commonwealth and the states. It requires,54
NA,cooperation but it particularly relies on state,54
NA,governments leaving the money where it is.,54
NA,I think it is important for members to,54
NA,recognise that Commonwealth expenditure has,54
NA,continued to increase in health generally. In,54
NA,"1991-92 it was approximately $13.8 billion,",54
NA,by 1994-95 it was $17.4 billion and specific,54
NA,funding to hospitals has increased by $800,54
NA,million since 1991-92. So we have been doing,54
NA,"our bit. Over that same two-year period, the",54
NA,states managed to slash $700 million from the,54
NA,same hospital budgets-$700 million while,54
NA,we are putting in $800 million. You can see,54
NA,"what the consequences would be. It is easy,",54
NA,"sadly, to round up the usual suspects: Kennett",54
NA,"in Victoria, Armitage in South Australia, and",54
NA,Kierath in Western Australia.,54
NA,"If you understand Medicare, as you claim",54
NA,"you want to say to the community, you have",54
NA,to understand that pulling $700 million out of,54
NA,the public hospitals is a mistake. In Vic-,54
NA,toria-and this needs to be underlined-$260,54
NA,million has been cut from the health budget,54
NA,"simple in two years; in Western Australia, $154",54
NA,million from its health budget in two years;,54
NA,"and, in South Australia, $61 million in the",54
NA,last two years-,54
NA,Mr Bilney-$65 million.,54
Dr LAWRENCE,Sixty-five million,54
NA,"dollars, I am corrected by a South Australian",54
NA,member. The coalition claims to have made,54
NA,a full commitmem to the principles of,54
NA,Medicare. By repeating them over and over,54
NA,again does not mean to say that that is going,54
NA,"to be seen as correct by the community,",54
NA,because what all your conservative govern-,54
NA,ments are doing are actually violating the,54
NA,The results are now principles.,54
NA,"Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition",54
NA,"wanted to say, 'You pick it all up by improv-",54
NA,ing private health cover and the use of private,54
NA,hospitals.' But what he does not understand,54
NA,"is that, every time you cut services in public",54
NA,"hospitals, you are not just increasing waiting",54
NA,lists-which is what those governments have,54
NA,been doing-you are cutting the availability,54
NA,"of material for scientists, and the generation",54
NA,to be trained is being sold short. So it is,54
NA,"certainly understood by their state colleagues,",54
NA,but there is nothing in the material that I have,54
NA,seen which shows that the opposition under-,54
NA,"stand. Their mantra seems to be: cut, bum and",54
NA,privatise.,54
NA,We have heard no objection at all either,54
NA,from the shadow spokesperson or from the,54
NA,Leader of the Opposition. All these cuts are,54
NA,"resulting in bed closures, increased waiting",54
NA,"lists, loss of services, loss of hundreds of jobs",54
NA,and industrial disputes-including the doctors,54
NA,in Victoria. That is your commitment to,54
NA,Medicare on the opposition benches. Until,54
NA,"you repudiate it, that is what Australians will",54
NA,see as Liberal governments in action.,54
NA,Minister for Human Services and Health,54
Mr HOWARD,My question is addressed,54
NA,to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime,54
NA,Minister of his own pledge on 19 December,54
NA,1991 when he rolled his former boss and,54
NA,"current ACTU advocate, Bob Hawke, that he",54
NA,"would: one, deal honestly deal with the",54
NA,"people; two, tell them the truth; and, three,",54
NA,resist the temptation to gild the lily. I also,54
NA,"remind the Prime Minister that, in response to",54
NA,"a question in this House on 28 August, he",55
NA,said: 'I insist that in the performance of their,55
NA,"public duties, in their dealings with the public",55
NA,and in the parliament ministers tell the truth,55
NA,and behave honestly at all times.' In view of,55
NA,the fact that a royal commission has now,55
NA,publicly found that the Minister for Human,55
NA,Services and Health not only gilded the lily,55
NA,"but clearly lied and, in doing so, clearly failed",55
NA,the ministerial test you so passionately in-,55
NA,"sisted upon in August, why do you not now",55
NA,insist that she step down as a minister in your,55
NA,government?,55
Mr KEATING,"Yeah, the way Peter",55
NA,Nixon did with Asia Dairy; the way when all,55
NA,"those sorts of characters were around? I mean,",55
NA,"you need a memory to be around here, you",55
NA,know. What about the meat substitution,55
NA,racket?,55
NA,"Mr Speaker, I can only again quote no less",55
NA,a source than Sir Garfield Barwick. He said:,55
NA,I find it remarkable that the public accept the,55
NA,conduct of royal commissions as a means of,55
NA,"obtaining evidence, bearing in mind that our",55
NA,"forebears revolted against the Star Chamber, which",55
NA,was a standing royal commission of its day. Press,55
NA,and politicians alike seem quite anxious to call,55
NA,"royal commissions in all manner of activities, not",55
NA,pausing to consider that the powers of a royal,55
NA,"commission are easily abused. Indeed, the public",55
NA,spectacle of witnesses squirming under questioning,55
NA,by the Commissioner or by his Assisting Counsel,55
NA,provides dramatic copy for the daily press to the,55
NA,delectation of many of its readers.,55
NA,"That is in his text, A radical tory, which was",55
NA,published this year. How apt those comments,55
NA,about a royal commission. I also made clear,55
NA,to the House the other day the points made by,55
NA,Sir Lawrence Street. He said:,55
NA,... a royal commission has no connection with the,55
NA,court as such. It has nothing,55
NA,istration of justice. A royal commission or a,55
NA,commission of inquiry is an instrument of the,55
NA,executive government and they are appointed in,55
NA,order to carry out a task that is put upon them by,55
NA,the executive government.,55
NA,"Mr Speaker, not only are those observations",55
NA,"completely correct, but as well as that we",55
NA,have the spectacle of Mr Marks himself,55
NA,saying that his professional training is such,55
NA,that he operates on all the facts. Let me quote,55
NA,him:,55
NA,The terms of reference have turned out of course,55
NA,to be fairly restrictive and stirred up a hornets nest.,55
NA,It is part of my training not to make assumptions,55
NA,on half the evidence.,55
NA,That did not stop him taking further views.,55
NA,Mr Costello--So he went on to hear all of,55
NA,it.,55
Mr KEATING,He did not.,55
NA,Mr Costello-He did.,55
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The Deputy Lead-,55
NA,er of the Opposition will not interject!,55
Mr KEATING,The terms of reference,55
NA,would not let him hear it all. He went on:,55
NA,The sooner this commission comes to an end the,55
NA,better. I think the experience here has demonstrated,55
NA,that the usefulness of royal commissions is fast,55
NA,receding. One thing one day and another the next,55
NA,has made virtually the result of this commission,55
NA,probably open to some doubt.,55
NA,It is entirely open to doubt. It is for that,55
NA,reason that it deserves to be treated with the,55
NA,utter contempt it deserves--contempt for the,55
NA,government which corruptly arranged for its,55
NA,sitting and its terms of reference; for the,55
NA,Leader of the Opposition and the former,55
NA,"deputy leader, the member for Chisholm, who",55
NA,for connived in the terms of reference; for Mr,55
NA,Richard Court who could not remember,55
speaking to Mr HOWARD ,he would not say he,55
NA,did not speak to him but he could not remem-,55
NA,ber; and for the manner in which the people,55
NA,were called.,55
NA,"Instead of first calling the petitioner, Mr",55
NA,"Easton, or the person who wrote the petition,",55
NA,"the clerk, or the person who presented the",55
NA,"petition, Mr Halden, who was the first wit-",55
NA,ness? A former press secretary to the minis-,55
NA,ter!,55
NA,"Mr Costello-Yes, a staffer-a press",55
NA,to do with the admin- secretary.,55
Mr SPEAKER,I am not going to con-,55
NA,tinue to advise the Deputy Leader of the,55
NA,Opposition to remain silent.,55
Mr KEATING,As I indicated to the,55
NA,"House the other day, we find that Mr Richard",55
NA,Court's private staff had given briefings to the,55
NA,commission before it actually undertook its,55
NA,"proceedings. In other words, the process was",55
NA,entirely corrupted. As I said at the beginning,55
NA,"of all this, no Queen's Counsel, no barrister,",55
NA,and no former judge should trust their reputa-,56
NA,tions with a reference like this. But Mr,56
NA,"Marks, in my view naively and foolishly, did",56
NA,and he has worn the admonition and the,56
NA,consequences as a result.,56
NA,From our point of view on this side of the,56
NA,House we regard the whole process as dis-,56
NA,reputable. The minister's standing in public,56
NA,life has been obvious for all to see. She quite,56
NA,courageously set up an open royal commis-,56
NA,sion on proper terms of reference into what,56
NA,was called WA Inc. That action left her with,56
NA,"quite a few enemies in Western Australia,",56
NA,some of whom had a chance to catch up with,56
NA,her during these grubby proceedings.,56
NA,Uniform Credit Code,56
Mr ADAMS,My question is directed to,56
NA,the Minister for Consumer Affairs. What is,56
NA,the status of action to implement a uniform,56
NA,credit code? Has the Tasmanian parliament,56
NA,"ratified that code? If not, why not?",56
Ms MCHUGH,The question that the,56
NA,honourable member asked actually exposes a,56
NA,"disgraceful and scandalous state of affairs, in",56
NA,that a few members of the upper house in,56
NA,Tasmania are holding hostage every consumer,56
NA,in Australia who is waiting for the benefits of,56
NA,the uniform credit legislation. We have been,56
NA,"waiting for this uniform legislation for years,",56
NA,although all states and territories agreed to it,56
NA,nearly two years ago. Consumers are waiting,56
NA,for it because of the very considerable ben-,56
NA,"efits that they will get, particularly in relation",56
NA,to the disclosure of detailed information. The,56
NA,"banks are waiting for it, because the banking",56
NA,code of practice cannot come into operation,56
NA,until a uniform credit code is in place.,56
NA,Queensland was the first state to pass the,56
NA,"template legislation, and all states have now",56
NA,passed it except for Western Australia and,56
NA,Tasmania. I am informed that it will pass,56
NA,through the lower house of the Western,56
NA,Australian parliament in the next couple,56
NA,"weeks, but it is a very different story in",56
NA,Tasmania.,56
NA,What has happened in Tasmania is this.,56
NA,bill to enact uniform credit legislation was,56
NA,sent back to the lower house from the upper,56
NA,house with an amendment to exempt three,56
NA,Tasmanian based finance companies from,56
NA,provisions. These companies are reported to,56
NA,"be the Hobart based Personal Finance Co., the",56
NA,Launceston based Lendco Pty Ltd and the,56
NA,Smithton based Braddon Investment and,56
NA,Finance Pty Ltd.,56
NA,It has been reported to my office that the,56
NA,companies have concerns with the code's,56
NA,rules concerning the precontractual disclosure,56
NA,of establishment fees. You have to ask why,56
NA,they would have problems with that. It has,56
NA,also been reported to my office that these,56
NA,three finance companies have very close links,56
NA,with members of the Tasmanian upper house.,56
NA,"Indeed, the Deputy Leader for the Govern-",56
NA,"ment in the upper house, Tony Fletcher, has",56
NA,declared that he is a shareholder in one of,56
NA,"these companies, and other members also",56
NA,reportedly have connections. That is what has,56
NA,been reported to me.,56
NA,The Tasmanian government refused to,56
NA,accept the amendment to exempt these com-,56
NA,"panies, so the bill has lapsed. That means",56
NA,"that, as a result of what appears to be some",56
NA,"pretty personal interests-some declared,",56
NA,some not--of a few members of the Tasman-,56
NA,"ian upper house, all consumers in Australia",56
NA,will not have the benefit of this uniform credit,56
NA,legislation.,56
NA,The member for Lyons asked what can be,56
NA,done about this. The fact is that this is state,56
NA,and territory legislation-it is not Common-,56
NA,wealth legislation. But I can inform members,56
NA,that the Commonwealth is represented on the,56
NA,"Standing Committee on Consumer Affairs,",56
NA,which met last Friday. That committee will,56
NA,propose that state and territory consumer,56
NA,affairs ministers agree to an implementation,56
NA,date of 1 August 1996 for the code and that,56
NA,they proceed without Tasmania.,56
NA,"The upshot therefore is that, if the states",56
NA,and territories do not agree to that recommen-,56
NA,"dation, the implementation of a uniform credit",56
NA,code is under serious threat. It also means,56
NA,"of that, if they do agree, Tasmanian consumers",56
NA,will miss out on the benefits that every other,56
NA,Australian consumer will enjoy under the,56
NA,"The legislation-all because three small, local",56
NA,"Tasmanian finance companies, which obvious-",56
NA,ly have very good connections in the Legisla-,56
NA,"tive Council, want to escape providing their",56
NA,its customers with the protection which this,56
NA,legislation ensures and which every consumer,57
NA,in Australia is waiting for.,57
NA,PRIME MINISTER,57
NA,Motion of Censure,57
Mr HOWARD ,Bennelong)-I seek leave,57
NA,to move a motion of censure against the,57
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Keating).,57
Mr KEATING ," Mr Speaker, I gave this offer",57
NA,to the Leader of the Opposition last Thursday.,57

Mr SLIPPER,As the last time I asked,60
NA,you to write a letter to a minister pursuant to,60
NA,standing order 150 produced a very quick,60
NA,"response, Mr Speaker, I was wondering",60
NA,whether you would write three letters to the,60
NA,"Treasurer with respect to questions 2553,",60
NA,"2554 and 2555, which first appeared on the",60
NA,Notice Paper on 22 August this year.,60

NA,the same quick response.,60
NA,Questions on Notice,60
Mr BRUCE SCOTT," Mr Speaker, I",60
NA,similarly rise to draw your attention to an,60
NA,"unanswered question, No. 2552. That question",60
NA,has been on the Notice Paper longer than 90,60
NA,days and I ask that under standing order 150,60
NA,you write to the Minister for Housing and,60
NA,Regional Development asking him to give an,60
NA,appropriate response.,60

NA,Questions on Notice,61
Mr NEHL,My request also relates to,61

Mr SPEAKER,I shall.,61
NA,Motion (by Mr Beazley)-by leave-,61
NA,agreed to:,61
NA,That so much of the standing and sessional,61
NA,orders can be suspended as would prevent order of,61
NA,"the day No.1, government business (Grievance",61

NA,PETITIONS,61
NA,The Acting Clerk-Petitions have been,61
NA,lodged for presentation as follows and copies,61
NA,will be referred to the appropriate ministers:,61
NA,To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the,61
NA,House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:,61
NA,The petition of the undersigned shows that:,61
NA,We believe that the traditional Christian view of,61
NA,the family unit excludes anything other than a male,61
NA,"and female, living in a lawful marriage relationship,",61
NA,"along with their children, and that it is necessary",61
NA,for this to be restated by our political leaders.,61
NA,We reaffirm our belief in the traditional Christian,61
NA,view of marriage as God's holy institution in which,61
NA,male and female become one flesh. (Genesis 2.24;,61
NA,"Matthew 19.5,6)",61
NA,"We reaffirm that God is the author of marriage, and",61
NA,has restricted it to the union of male with female,61
NA,and that such marriage between male and female,61
NA,is commended in Scripture as honourable among,61
NA,all. (Ephesians 5.15-23),61
NA,We reaffirm that such marriage between male and,61
NA,"female is ordained for life-long companionship,",61
NA,help and comfort which husband and wife ought to,61
NA,"have of each other. (Romans 7.2,3)",61
NA,We reaffirm that children are a heritage of the Lord,61
NA,"and should be nurtured in a godly home, and that",61
NA,human society can be strong and happy only where,61
NA,the marriage bond is held in honour. (Psalm 127.3),61
NA,We reaffirm that incestuous marriages can never be,61
NA,"made lawful by the law of any man or government,",61
NA,"or the consent of parties, so as to allow those",61
NA,people to live together as married couples. (Mark,61
NA,6.18; Leviticus 18.6-28),61
NA,"We reaffirm that, according to Biblical law, it is",61
NA,forbidden for a male to practise sexual intercourse,61
NA,"with another male, or for a female with a female,",61
NA,and that since this is an abomination before the,61
NA,"Lord, such as a prohibited relationship for marriage.",61
NA,(Leviticus 18.22; 20.13),61
NA,We believe the entire stability and well being of,61
NA,our society depends on maintaining this traditional,61
NA,Christian view of marriage and family (Leviticus,61
NA,10.15-16; 18.23-24),61
NA,Your Petitioners ask that the House of Representa-,61
NA,tives should call on the Government to:,61
NA,BUSINESS,61
NA,(a) Preserve completely intact the exclusiveness,61
NA,of marriage as being one male and one female.,61
NA,(b) That the definition of a prohibited relation-,61
NA,"ship in the Marriage Act 1961, Part III 23(2) be",61
NA,amended with the addition of a new clause (c) so,61
NA,that it reads as follows:,61
NA,(2) Marriages of parties within a prohibited,61
NA,relationship are marriages-,61
NA,(a) between a person and an ancestor or descend-,61
NA,ant of the person; or,61
NA,(b) between a brother and a sister (whether of the,61
NA,whole blood or the half blood); or,61
NA,Marriage (c) between a male and a male or between a,61
NA,female and a female.,61

NA,To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the,61
NA,House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:,61
NA,The petition of certain residents of the Electorate,61
NA,of Higgins draw to the attention of the House our,61
NA,concern that local planning authorities are not able,61
NA,to fully represent the wishes of local residents,61
NA,under the present Telecommunications National,61
NA,Code.,61
NA,We therefore request that the House take the,61
NA,necessary steps to resolve the above issue and that,61
NA,a new Telecommunications National Code be,61
NA,introduced with more power for local councils so,61
NA,that the concerns of the community are taken into,61
NA,account and residents are fully informed of planned,61
NA,installations of mobile telephone towers and cabling,61
NA,for pay television.,61

NA,Newsagents,61
NA,To the Right Honourable The Speaker and Mem-,61
NA,bers of the House of Representatives in Parliament,61
NA,Assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned,61
NA,citizens of the State of Victoria respectfully shows:,61
NA,(1) Authorised news agents are one of the last,61
NA,remaining bastions of family owned and operated,61
NA,"business and provide an efficient, low-cost and",62
NA,convenient service;,62
NA,(2) The present system of newspaper distribution,62
NA,"guarantees that every Victorian, no matter where",62
NA,"they live, has access to home delivery of daily",62
NA,newspapers;,62
NA,(3) Owners of news agencies have purchased their,62
NA,business and invested in new technology on the,62
NA,security of a defined distribution territory for,62
NA,delivery and supply to sub-agents;,62
NA,(4) The Trade Practices Commission's plans to,62
NA,deregulate newspaper distribution will spell the end,62
NA,"of universal home delivery, increase costs to",62
NA,consumers and force many news agents out of busi-,62
NA,ness.,62
NA,"Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the",62
NA,Parliament of Australia will:,62
NA,(a) express its support for the present system of,62
NA,newspaper distribution in Victoria and the commer-,62
NA,cial survival of family owned and operated news-,62
NA,agents; and,62
NA,(b) urge the Federal Government to direct the,62
NA,Trade Practices Commission to ensure that its,62
NA,deliberations do not disadvantage newsagents who,62
NA,have invested time and money into building,62
NA,reputable businesses based on commercial arrange-,62
NA,ments which the Commission proposes to abolish.,62
NA,"by Mr Atkinson (from 26,772 citizens).",62
NA,Family Law Act,62
NA,To the honourable the Speaker and members of the,62
NA,House of Representatives assembled in parliament.,62
NA,The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia,62
NA,draws to the attention of the House the need for,62
NA,changes to the Family Law Act of Australia and to,62
NA,the Child Support Scheme.,62
NA,Your petitioners therefore pray that the House enact,62
NA,the following changes:,62
NA,1. That the existing Family Law Act be scrapped,62
NA,and replaced by a more simplified version together,62
NA,with the minimum of rules and regulations neces-,62
NA,sary.,62
NA,2. That The Family Court be replaced by a,62
NA,Tribunal and that all matters resulting from divorce,62
NA,"and family breakdown be heard before, and deter-",62
NA,"mined by a panel, the panel to be made up of",62
NA,persons qualified in matters arising from family,62
NA,breakdown.,62
NA,3. That legal professionals be barred from,62
NA,appearing before the Tribunal resulting in vast,62
NA,savings to the disputing parties.,62
NA,4. That a modified fault clause be re-introduced,62
NA,to Family Law primarily designed to discourage,62
NA,adultery and to stop rewarding adulterers at the,62
NA,expense of deserted and innocent parties.,62
NA,5. That the Child Support Agency be scrapped,62
NA,and replaced by an appropriate administrative,62
NA,procedure within the Tribunal.,62
NA,6. That apart from cases of exceptional circum-,62
NA,stances parental-child access become the inalienable,62
NA,right of all parents.,62
NA,"7. That alternative counselling, (Government",62
NA,funded) be made available through the churches,62
NA,home and that much more emphasis be placed on medi-,62
NA,ation in resolving disputes prior to the commence-,62
NA,ment of legal proceedings.,62
NA,by Mr Beale (from 80 citizens).,62
NA,Landmines,62
NA,To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the,62
NA,House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:,62
NA,This petition of certain residents of the State of,62
NA,Victoria draws to the attention of the House the,62
NA,"devastating effects of landmines, which maim and",62
NA,kill often decades after hostilities have ceased.,62
NA,Your petitioners therefore request the House to:,62
NA,(a) Through bilateral and multilateral relations,62
NA,"press for an international ban on the use, produc-",62
NA,"tion, stockpiling, sale, transfer and export of anti-",62
NA,personnel mines; and,62
NA,(b) Press the United Nations to establish and,62
NA,administer an international fund to promote and,62
NA,finance victim assistance programs and landmine,62
NA,"awareness, clearance and eradication programs",62
NA,worldwide.,62
NA,by Mr Beale (from 20 citizens).,62
NA,Bears,62
NA,To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the,62
NA,House of Representatives assembled in Parliament.,62
NA,The petition of certain residents of the State of,62
NA,Australia draws to the attention of the House that,62
NA,"approximately 8,000 bears are being kept in cages",62
NA,in China for the purpose of extracting bile for,62
NA,medical purposes and that the cages are so small,62
NA,"the bears cannot move, which results in some of",62
NA,them going mad. It is further brought to the atten-,62
NA,tion of the House that the Chinese plan to increase,62
NA,"the number of bears, for these purposes, to 40,000.",62
NA,Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the,62
NA,House of Representatives to object most strongly,62
NA,to this horrendous and tragic practice and ask that,62
NA,steps be taken to stop it immediately.,62
NA,"by Mr Cameron (from 1,288 citizens).",62
NA,Eastern Energy Electricity System,62
NA,To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the,62
NA,House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:,62
NA,The petition of the undersigned expresses the,62
NA,concern of the current owners and customers of,62
NA,Eastern Energy at the decision of the Victorian,62
NA,Liberal Government to sell Eastern Energy to the,63
NA,highest bidder; a process that could lead to Eastern,63
NA,"Energy owned by Electricity de France, a corpora-",63
NA,tion 1()() per cent owned by the French Government,63
NA,of Jacques Chirac.,63
NA,Your petitioners ask that the House of Represen-,63

NA,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,66
NA,Question proposed:,66
NA,That grievances be noted.,66
NA,Public Service: Staff Cuts,66
Mr SMYTH ,Canberra) (4.30 p.m.)-It is,66
NA,about time this government came clean on,66
NA,what it is up to with Public Service staffing,66
NA,"Austudy numbers. You may recall that in May, before",66
NA,"the budget, the Canberra Times ran a line that",66
NA,"up to 4,000 public servants in this town may",66
NA,lose their jobs. Being the member for Can-,66
NA,"berra, it is important to me and to all my",66
NA,constituents because so much of the business,66
NA,that is conducted here in Canberra depends on,66
NA,the Public Service. The Minister Assisting the,66
NA,Prime Minister for Public Service Matters ( Mr,66
NA,Johns) did not know and could not say how,66
NA,many jobs would go. The minister could not,66
NA,say what the implications were in the budget,66
NA,for Public Service numbers.,66
NA,I wrote the minister a letter and in that,66
NA,letter I referred to recent media reports in,66
NA,which it was claimed that the government,66
NA,intends to make large cuts to the Australian,66
NA,Public Service as a result of the 1995 budget.,66
NA,"I wrote to him on behalf of all Canberrans,",66
NA,expecting a reasonable answer. You will be,66
NA,"amazed, I am sure, when you find out that in",66
NA,the letter I got back from the Minister Assist-,66
NA,ing the Prime Minister for Public Service,66
NA,Matters he claimed that he did not know how,67
NA,many jobs would be going. He said:,67
NA,As the implementation of the Government's Budget,67
NA,decisions is the responsibility of individual,67
NA,"ministers and their Departments, I am unable to",67
NA,provide you with the precise figures on the possible,67
NA,staffing impact of the Budget.,67
NA,"That is fair enough, I guess. It means that,",67
NA,"like so much of the Public Service, the re-",67
NA,sponsibility has been devolved to the depart-,67
NA,mental level and they spend their money as,67
NA,they see appropriate. That was okay.,67
NA,I then put a question on notice to each of,67
NA,"the ministers asking, given that the Minister",67
NA,Assisting the Prime Minister for Public,67
NA,"Service Matters had said they would know,",67
NA,whether they would please tell me what the,67
NA,implications of this year's budget were on,67
NA,Public Service numbers. I did that on 30 June.,67
NA,I am sure you will be surprised to find out,67
NA,"that, so far, I have not had a single response.",67
NA,What I have actually had is nothing. It was,67
NA,just a waste of time.,67
NA,I was forced to ask the Speaker on 17 and,67
NA,24 October if he would write to the ministers,67
NA,and get them to respond to me. The Speaker,67
NA,kindly did so. I am getting back answers that,67
NA,are a bit of a form letter. They state:,67
NA,Thank you for your letter of 17 October 1995 in,67
NA,which you pointed out that a Question on Notice,67
NA,"... placed by Mr BM Smyth, Member for Can-",67
NA,berra ... had not been answered within the 90 day,67
NA,answering period. You would be aware this same,67
NA,question was also posed to 20 other Ministers.,67
NA,Subsequent to this question I have been advised by,67
NA,the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet that,67
NA,the Minister for Finance will respond on behalf of,67
NA,all Ministers.,67
NA,This is very curious because the minister,67
NA,responsible for the Public Service could not,67
NA,"answer that question himself, but it would",67
NA,now appear that the Minister for Finance ( Mr,67
NA,Beazley) is well able to do that. It is curious,67
NA,because the Department of the Prime Minister,67
NA,and Cabinet has been coordinating this re-,67
NA,sponse through the Minister for Finance since,67
NA,about mid-July. Even if you allow them 90,67
NA,"days from mid-July, that would give a re-",67
NA,sponse date of mid-October. Here we are,67
NA,almost in December and we still do not know,67
NA,what the implications of this year's budget are,67
NA,on Public Service numbers.,67
NA,This is extraordinary. Not only is it extra-,67
NA,ordinary because it is a total disregard for the,67
NA,"parliamentary and democratic processes, but",67
NA,P0l1folio obviously the government holds all public,67
NA,"servants in contempt. ObvIously, the govern-",67
NA,ment does not know what they are doing with,67
NA,the Public Service. I think this is part of the,67
NA,malaise that found voice so clearly in the,67
NA,Canberra by-election when so many Canberr-,67
NA,ans felt they had been treated with arrogance,67
NA,and contempt by this government-given that,67
NA,the Public Service is the main industry of the,67
NA,"ACT, that the government does not know",67
NA,what they are doing with public servants and,67
NA,Public Service numbers inside the ACT show,67
NA,that the government has not learnt from the,67
NA,Canberra by-election.,67
NA,This also raises the question of whether or,67
NA,not the minister is competent to continue in,67
NA,his portfolio. If the Minister for Finance can,67
NA,"come up with these answers, or is indeed",67
NA,"charged with coming up with these answers,",67
NA,how is it that the Minister Assisting the Prime,67
NA,Minister for Public Service Matters cannot?,67
NA,It is curious that the minister assisting said,67
NA,that only the departments could answer,67
NA,because of the devolved responsibilities. It,67
NA,may well have been easy for him to have,67
NA,asked all the other ministers to give him the,67
NA,answers and to put an answer to my question,67
NA,"together, but obviously he was not up to it",67
NA,because PM&C has decided that the Minister,67
NA,for Finance should do that.,67
NA,Given that PM&C is actually coordinating,67
NA,this and that the Minister for Finance will do,67
NA,"it, the question is raised: when will this",67
NA,happen and how long will it take? We are,67
NA,almost five months into the new budget cycle,67
NA,and this government still does not know what,67
NA,"it is doing with the Public Service, and it does",67
NA,not know what it is doing with Public Service,67
NA,numbers.,67
NA,This is evident in a couple of other areas as,67
NA,weB when you take into account things like,67
NA,the MPRA review of the Australian War,67
NA,"Memorial, which went so badly for the",67
NA,"government, and indeed when you take into",67
NA,account that new Public Service legislation,67
NA,was supposed to be before this House before,67
NA,the end of the year. I had a meeting with the,67
NA,Public Service Commissioner the other day,67
NA,and he kindly told me that it would appear,68
NA,that the new Public Service legislation will be,68
NA,presented in this House at the earliest in,68
NA,"possibly March next year. In fact, the Public",68
NA,Service Commissioner and some of the other,68
NA,departments are getting ready to present new,68
NA,legislation in July next year. It makes you,68
NA,wonder who is in charge of Public Service,68
NA,activities inside this government.,68
NA,But it goes on. In the last 12 months we,68
NA,have seen the number of public servants axed,68
NA,under this government double. The govern-,68
NA,ment is quite capable of producing the figures,68
NA,"for the number of public servants it has axed,",68
NA,but it does not know how many it is going to,68
NA,"get rid of. It can do it for last year, but it",68
NA,cannot do it for this year. Does that mean we,68
NA,now have to wait until next year to find out,68
NA,what was done in this year? If you have any,68
NA,"management experience, you would know that",68
NA,that is not a very competent or a very oblig-,68
NA,ing way to run a business.,68
NA,If the Minister for Finance is now working,68
NA,"on the answer, and he is-one of the letters",68
NA,I got back stated that he is 'currently seeking,68
NA,more information'-where will this answer,68
NA,come from and how is it that the minister,68
NA,assisting could not do this? It seems curious,68
NA,that one of the most senior ministers in the,68
NA,government has been tasked with the fairly,68
NA,simple task of asking 21 departments how,68
NA,many public servants they are going to axe,68
NA,"this year, if they are going to axe any, when",68
NA,the minister assisting could not do it.,68
NA,What does his inability to answer these,68
NA,questions say about his entire management of,68
NA,"the Public Service and, indeed, about the new",68
NA,Public Service Act? I think it is up to the,68
NA,minister to answer what he really does as the,68
NA,Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for,68
NA,Public Service Matters and whether he is,68
NA,doing anything at all.,68
NA,"At the same time, in this country we have",68
NA,the great problem of youth unemployment.,68
NA,"Over the last few years, APS employment of",68
NA,young people under the age of 25 has,68
NA,"dropped by 60 per cent. Again, that input of",68
NA,new individuals into the Public Service itself,68
NA,is not happening. Young people in the ACT,68
NA,are being denied an opportunity to get into,68
NA,the Public Service.,68
NA,We have a minister who does not know,68
NA,how many people he is in control of. We,68
NA,have a minister that allows things like the,68
NA,MPRA review of the War Memorial to go,68
NA,ahead without any apology when it is found,68
NA,to be faulty. And now we have a minister,68
NA,overseeing a Public Service that is denying,68
NA,positions to young people in my electorate,68
NA,"and, indeed, all electorates around Australia.",68
NA,The other thing that makes me worried,68
NA,about the administration of the Public Service,68
NA,and the things that are going on now is the,68
NA,number of departments that have been trans-,68
NA,"ferred out of Canberra and, in general, the",68
NA,decline in the numbers in the Public Service.,68
NA,If we look at the actual figures the budget,68
NA,"papers contain, we see that the drop was",68
NA,"about 1,700. I fully expected to get that back",68
NA,"as an answer, but obviously that is not the",68
NA,right answer.,68
NA,What this now does is throw into doubt the,68
NA,whole validity of the budget papers. The,68
NA,budget papers and the ASL are how the,68
NA,government works out its expenditure on,68
NA,public servants. Given that there is one figure,68
NA,in the budget papers that the government is,68
NA,"obviously not willing to back up, what are the",68
NA,true figures and what are the implications for,68
NA,Public Service expenditure?,68
NA,The government have placed a lot of credi-,68
NA,bility on the question of this year's budget but,68
NA,if they cannot answer how many public,68
NA,"servants they expect to employ this year, then",68
NA,any figures that they have put forward in,68
NA,relation to expenditure on wages must also be,68
NA,"very rubbery. I put it to you, Mr Deputy",68
NA,"Speaker, that this throws this year's budget",68
NA,into further doubt.,68
NA,Canberra is the national capital and it is,68
NA,right that there are Public Service functions,68
NA,here. Given that about 48 per cent of the,68
NA,employment in this city is provided by the,68
NA,"Public Service, these are important questions",68
NA,"to all Canberrans. Indeed, the government's",68
NA,"policy, how the government administers this",68
NA,country and how the government spends,68
NA,taxpayers' money are important questions to,68
NA,all Australians. If the government are appro-,68
NA,priating money and putting money towards,68
NA,public servants that they do not even know,68
NA,"whether they have, then you have to call into",68
NA,question the administration of the Australian,69
NA,Public Service by this government; you have,69
NA,to call into question the administration of the,69
NA,Australian Public Service by the current,69
NA,minister and you have to call into question,69
NA,how accurate the budget figures are in relation,69
NA,to public servants and Public Service expendi-,69
NA,ture. (Time expired),69
NA,Aircraft Noise,69
Mr HAVILAND ,Macarthur) (4.40 p.m.)-,69
NA,My grievance today is about a subject that is,69
NA,debated quite a lot in this place: aircraft noise,69
NA,around airports. Earlier today I presented a,69
NA,petition to the Bills and Papers Office obtain-,69
NA,"ing 1,221 signatures. The petition reads:",69
NA,"""The humble petition of certain citizens of Australof",69
NA,ia respectfully showeth:,69
NA,That we oppose the construction of Sydney West,69
NA,Airport at Badgerys Creek by the Federal,69
NA,"Government, without a new and comprehensive",69
NA,Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) being,69
NA,completed.,69
NA,"The previous EIS was done over ten years ago, and",69
NA,did not take account of the rapid growth in our area,69
NA,or the inadequacy of aircraft noise prediction,69
NA,techniques. The noise problems experienced at,69
NA,Kingsford Smith Airport will be worse in our area,69
NA,as Sydney West will operate twenty four hours a,69
NA,day over now quiet semi-rural and residential areas.,69
NA,Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you,69
NA,will not allow construction of Sydney West Airport,69
NA,at Badgerys Creek until a new and comprehensive,69
NA,Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) has been,69
NA,completed.,69
NA,"And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever",69
NA,"pray.""",69
NA,"As I said, the petition has 1,221 signatures,",69
NA,and I understand there are many more on the,69
NA,way. The petition reflects the deep concern,69
NA,amongst residents in my electorate and neigh-,69
NA,bouring electorates about the likely effect of,69
NA,the construction and operation of Sydney,69
NA,West airport. This concern has obviously,69
NA,increased dramatically since the opening of,69
NA,the third runway at Sydney airport in Novem-,69
NA,ber last year and the resulting noise problem,69
NA,in the inner city.,69
NA,The publicity surrounding the chaos caused,69
NA,by the new runway at Mascot could not have,69
NA,"been missed by residents in my electorate,",69
NA,particularly as it has become fashionable for,69
NA,inner city politicians to say that the answer to,69
NA,the noise problems in Sydney is to fast-track,69
NA,Badgerys Creek airport. There is no doubt,69
NA,that Sydney badly needs a second interna-,69
NA,tional airport and has done for many years.,69
NA,But it is not good enough for inner city,69
NA,"politicians, would-be politicians and single",69
NA,issue parties to simply presume that they can,69
NA,fix their noise problem by moving the noise,69
NA,out west.,69
NA,It has become quite clear from this petition,69
NA,and from the hundreds of letters and phone,69
NA,calls I have received in my electorate office,69
NA,that residents in my electorate will not cop,69
NA,aircraft noise being transferred out there and,69
NA,will certainly not cop anything like the level,69
NA,noise now being experienced in places like,69
NA,"Marrickville and Sydenham. Indeed, I regular-",69
NA,ly receive phone calls and letters from all,69
NA,over my electorate from places like Theresa,69
NA,"Park, Thirlmere, Tahmoor, Bradbury, Narel-",69
NA,"lan, Camden and Warragamba. These people",69
NA,do not want this airport because in many,69
NA,cases they moved away from inner Sydney to,69
NA,get away from aircraft noise and pollution.,69
NA,I even get many calls from people in the,69
NA,Thirlmere area complaining about current,69
NA,aircraft noise associated with the changed,69
NA,flight paths to Mascot airport. At first I found,69
NA,"this unbelievable, but I have noticed when",69
NA,flying from Canberra to Sydney that the,69
NA,planes are flying a different route than they,69
NA,used to-we know that-and in many cases,69
NA,are flying much lower than previously. So,69
NA,you can understand the concerns people have,69
NA,about the likely noise impact of Badgerys,69
NA,Creek airport.,69
NA,The Minister for Transport ( Mr Brereton),69
NA,has said many times that in the construction,69
NA,of Sydney West airport we do not want to,69
NA,repeat the mistakes of Kingsford Smith,69
NA,airport. One of the first mistakes which,69
NA,should not be repeated is to proceed with,69
NA,construction of the airport at Badgerys Creek,69
NA,"without a comprehensive, up-to-date EIS,",69
NA,"particularly examining the questions of noise,",69
NA,air and water pollution. The government has,69
NA,already announced a study to update some as-,69
NA,"pects of the previous EIS, which was done in",69
NA,1985. Whether this will satisfy the concerns,69
NA,of residents remains to be seen.,69
NA,While it can be argued that you don't need,70
NA,"to completely repeat the 1985 study, which",70
NA,included geological and other details which,70
NA,"would not require updating, the request",70
NA,contained in the petition for a new and com-,70
NA,prehensive EIS is nevertheless valid. As the,70
NA,"petition points out, the 1985 EIS did not take",70
NA,account of the rapid housing development and,70
NA,population growth in the surrounding areas.,70
NA,Due to the policies of the previous Liberal,70
NA,"state government, there has been considerable",70
NA,urban expansion in the surrounding areas,70
NA,since 1988. These include housing estates at,70
NA,Cecil Park and Silverdale in my electorate.,70
NA,The previous state government had also,70
NA,planned a huge housing development at South,70
NA,"Creek, but this has not proceeded. There has",70
NA,"also been rapid growth around Narellan,",70
NA,"Mount Annan, Currans Hill and to the south",70
NA,of Campbelltown.,70
NA,The Macarthur region is the fastest growing,70
NA,area in New South Wales. People throughout,70
NA,"the electorate of Macarthur, as well as those",70
NA,in the adjoining electorates of Werriwa and,70
NA,"Prospect, are expressing concern about where",70
NA,the flight paths from Badgerys Creek might,70
NA,go. It is not a simple matter of transferring,70
NA,the aircraft noise out west to overcome the,70
NA,problems in the inner city. One of the issues,70
NA,"for Macarthur, which includes rural and semi-",70
NA,"rural areas, is that there is much less back-",70
NA,ground noise than there is in the inner sub-,70
NA,"urbs of Sydney, so the impact of any aircraft",70
NA,noise will be much greater on residents in,70
NA,these areas than otherwise would be the case.,70
NA,All governments make mistakes and if,70
NA,governments remain in office for a long,70
NA,period they are bound to make mistakes. I,70
NA,believe one of the greatest mistakes made by,70
NA,this government was in 1989 when it decided,70
NA,to build the third runway at Mascot rather,70
NA,than getting on with building a second airport.,70
NA,Having nominated Badgerys Creek as the site,70
NA,"for the second airport in 1985, and having",70
NA,"completed an EIS at that time, the govern-",70
NA,ment should have got on with the job of,70
NA,building the airport then.,70
NA,"Like most Labor politicians at federal,",70
NA,"and local government level in Sydney, I",70
NA,opposed the third runway at Mascot. Interest-,70
NA,"ingly, the coalition supported it. As we have",70
NA,"seen in this House in recent weeks, we now",70
NA,have the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr How-,70
NA,"ard) and the former Premier, now Liberal",70
NA,"candidate for Macarthur, John Fahey, playing",70
NA,opportunist politics with the issue of airports,70
NA,"and aircraft noise, despite their well-recorded",70
NA,"previous positions on this issue. Clearly, one",70
NA,of the problems with the third runway and the,70
NA,resultant noise chaos is that the EIS process,70
NA,was less than satisfactory. Let us ensure that,70
NA,this mistake is not repeated at Sydney West,70
NA,airport.,70
NA,"Shortly, the draft flight paths for Sydney",70
NA,West will become known. This will hopefully,70
NA,clarify the situation for many residents who,70
NA,will find that they may not be affected at all,70
NA,by aircraft noise from the new airport. It will,70
NA,also reduce the scope for scaremongering by,70
NA,the opposition over aircraft noise. Neverthe-,70
NA,"less, I urge the government to at the very",70
NA,least conduct a comprehensive review of the,70
NA,"1985 EIS in all relevant aspects, such as",70
NA,"aircraft"" noise, noise pollution, air pollution",70
NA,"and water pollution, and to do that before",70
NA,construction of the airport commences.,70
NA,In recent times a bill to privatise airports,70
NA,has been blocked in the Senate and this is,70
NA,likely to hold up the construction of Badgerys,70
NA,Creek airport. This is unfortunate. It had been,70
NA,"the government's plan, supported I understand",70
NA,"by all sides of the House, to build the airport",70
NA,"by the year 2000. Hopefully, that will still be",70
NA,"possible, but it should not go ahead without",70
NA,an updated environmental impact statement,70
NA,which will look at various aspects such as,70
NA,noise. Otherwise the people of south-west,70
NA,Sydney and people in my electorate will not,70
NA,be satisfied that they should have to put up,70
NA,"with a new airport, especially given the",70
NA,horrendous outcome of the third runway and,70
NA,the noise that people are copping in Sydney.,70
NA,"As bad as that is, it is not satisfactory to",70
NA,transfer the noise to the western suburbs-any,70
NA,more than it is satisfactory to do what the,70
NA,"Leader of the Opposition suggested: that is,",70
NA,share the noise around.,70
NA,This is a very important issue which must,70
NA,state be clarified and determined as quickly as,70
NA,possible. This is an area where a lot of young,70
NA,people buy their first home. They move there,70
NA,to get away from Sydney-to get away from,70
NA,"the city life, aircraft noise and other things. It",71
NA,is very important that the matter is clarified,71
NA,very soon. I look forward to seeing the draft,71
NA,flight paths at the earliest opportunity.,71
Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE ,Dawson) (4.50,71
NA,p.m.)-I bring to the attention of the House,71
NA,what a member referred to the 'ugly,71
NA,Australian' last Wednesday. The member for,71
NA,"Deakin ( Mr Aldred), from a separate and",71
NA,"independent source, came to the same conclu-",71
NA,sion as I did-that Westpac is abusing its,71
NA,banking licence and the legal system to,71
NA,prevent its becoming accountable for all its,71
NA,deficiencies revealed in what is known as the,71
NA,Westpac or French letters. My concern goes,71
NA,to the inquiry by the then House of Represen-,71
NA,tatives finance and public administration,71
NA,committee into banking and deregulation. Its,71
NA,first report A pocketful of change was tabled,71
NA,in the House of Representatives in November,71
NA,1991 and its follow-up Checking the changes,71
NA,in October 1992. The member for Fairfax ( Mr,71
NA,Somlyay) and I are the only remaining mem-,71
NA,bers of that original committee still on the,71
NA,"current banking, finance and public adminis-",71
NA,tration committee.,71
NA,The crux of the first report that I can recall,71
NA,"is that some of the major banks, under their",71
NA,"deregulated role, went deeply into foreign",71
NA,currency loans on behalf of clients and never,71
NA,had the experience or the staff to properly,71
NA,market and service the product. Westpac's,71
NA,whole litany of inexperience and then deceit,71
NA,was offered up by the bank's Mr Stuart,71
NA,Fowler in a series of letters between the bank,71
NA,"and its lawyers, Allen Allen and Hemsley. It",71
NA,is on the public record that on 7 March 1991,71
NA,these letters were tabled at the inquiry. The,71
NA,committee indicated that it would thoroughly,71
NA,examine the issues raised in the letters as well,71
NA,as the more general matter of foreign currency,71
NA,"loans. In fact, this became a prominent part of",71
NA,that inquiry.,71
NA,The then Senator MCLean provided a mass,71
NA,of evidence to the committee in connection,71
NA,with not only these but also many other,71
NA,matters with other banks where he maintained,71
NA,the banks were abusing their banking licences.,71
NA,The then Senator MCLean called on the,71
NA,committee to recommend a royal commission,71
NA,"into these abuses by the banks. Unfortunately,",71
NA,"as I now view subsequent and current tactics,",71
NA,"especially by Westpac, we made the wrong",71
NA,decision in not insisting on a judicial inquiry,71
NA,or a royal commission at that time. Our only,71
NA,Banking recommendation on the Westpac letters was,71
NA,recommendation 61:,71
NA,The Attorney-General refer the so called Westpac,71
NA,Letters to the National Crime Authority for investi-,71
NA,gation as to whether any criminal wrong doings,71
NA,arise from the management of foreign exchange,71
NA,contracts by Partnership Pacific Limited.,71
NA,While I understand that the letters were,71
NA,"referred to the National Crime Authority, no",71
NA,action was taken. These papers were not,71
NA,tested. The most self-incriminatory piece of,71
NA,evidence given to the inquiry was not investi-,71
NA,gated and the only reason I have been given,71
NA,is that the NCA had insufficient resources and,71
NA,"funds. No wonder so many people hurt, not",71
NA,"only by Westpac but also by other banks,",71
NA,"have lost faith in our parliamentary system,",71
NA,our committees and this report. I believe and,71
NA,now recommend that the government should,71
NA,set up a royal commission or a judicial in-,71
NA,quiry to inquire into the Westpac letters and,71
NA,other related matters.,71
NA,I now tum to a related matter which re-,71
NA,quired litigation by former clients of the,71
NA,banks. The committee heard evidence about,71
NA,the cost of the settlement of cases and dispute,71
NA,resolution. It was obvious from evidence that,71
NA,banks could force former clients to insolvency,71
NA,in legal and court costs before the matter,71
NA,could be properly judged by a court. This,71
NA,surplus of funds by the banks to engage top,71
NA,lawyers and expend large amounts-all tax,71
NA,deductible-was in contrast to the financial,71
NA,"resources to respond with adequate funds, not",71
NA,"tax deductible, for legal expenses by the",71
NA,client. This led to recommendation 60:,71
NA,"... that an independent mediator (or mediators),",71
NA,"funded by the banks, but acceptable to both banks",71
NA,and foreign currency borrowers be appointed to,71
NA,mediate in foreign currency loans cases that remain,71
NA,"in dispute. Mediation is not compulsory, banks will",71
NA,pay for their own mediators or for a general,71
NA,mediator based on usage. The detenninations of the,71
NA,mediator will not be binding on either party. Banks,71
NA,"should endeavour, to the extent possible, to advise",71
NA,all foreign currency loan borrowers of the media-,71
NA,tory mechanism.,71
NA,Some banks have engaged in meaningful,72
NA,dispute resolution. Westpac has not. The,72
NA,member for Deakin gave a detailed summary,72
NA,of one such case. I have evidence of another.,72
NA,This case ended in Westpac bankrupting,72
NA,Heather and John Donkin after unsuccessfully,72
NA,endeavouring to have that done by the Tax-,72
NA,ation Office on its behalf and then having to,72
NA,do it itself to ensure that a bankrupt could not,72
NA,"continue a case against it. In fact, the solicithe",72
NA,tors for AGC Advances Ltd-Messrs Clayton,72
NA,Utz-followed this decision up with the,72
NA,official receiver in Brisbane requesting the,72
NA,trustee to elect whether or not he wished to,72
NA,"continue with court action and, further, to",72
NA,undertake not to assign interest to Mr Donkin,72
NA,or any other person in that case. This is,72
NA,typical of the intimidatory actions that this,72
NA,bank is capable of producing. The effect on,72
NA,the Donkins of this and the letters in the,72
NA,"Drambo, or Porters, case was to dissuade",72
NA,some of those who were representing the,72
NA,Donkins to cease their services under the,72
NA,threat that costs in the eventual pursuance of,72
NA,the case would be sought against the repre-,72
NA,sentatives in the event the bank won the court,72
NA,action.,72
NA,"Other matters, post the banking inquiry, not",72
NA,mentioned or investigated to any extent are,72
NA,now coming to light in other court cases and,72
NA,"those settled on the court steps, such as",72
NA,Stringer v. ANZ in South Australia. These,72
NA,additional points include: the extent of point,72
NA,taking by the banks at the expense of the,72
NA,"client-in Drambo's case, I understand this",72
NA,part of the claim is for $3 million or $4,72
NA,million; whether in fact the client actually,72
NA,borrowed foreign currency or whether the,72
NA,"bank did itself and, upon bringing the pro-",72
NA,"ceeds onshore, then lent to the client but",72
NA,charged the client for the exchange losses and,72
NA,took the profit of point making for itself; and,72
NA,the fact that withholding tax should have,72
NA,"never been deducted from clients' funds, as",72
NA,found in subsequent cases.,72
NA,"Thankfully, I can report that AGC Advan-",72
NA,ces intentions have apparently been thwarted,72
NA,by a letter I received from the Minister for,72
NA,"Justice ( Mr Kerr), which states:",72
NA,I refer to your letter of 9 October 1995 to the,72
NA,Attorney-General in which you made representa-,72
NA,"tions on behalf of your constituents, Mr CJ and",72
NA,"Mrs HK Donkin, both of whom are bankrupt, in",72
NA,relation to their proposed High Court action against,72
NA,AGC Advances Ltd.,72
NA,"As you know, on the bankruptcy of Mr Donkin, his",72
NA,right to conduct the action vested in the trustee of,72
NA,"his estate (the Official Trustee). I note that, under",72
NA,"subsection 60(2) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966, the",72
NA,Official Receiver ... has elected not to continue,72
NA,the action.,72
NA,"However, I understand that, so as not to frustrate",72
NA,"Donkins' action, the Official Receiver proposes",72
NA,assigning the rights in it to Mr Donkin. The,72
NA,assignment would allow Mr Donkin to continue the,72
NA,"action, notwithstanding that he is bankrupt.",72
NA,"The problem still remains for the Donkins,",72
NA,having already expended thousands of dollars,72
NA,"in legal representation, now being bankrupted",72
NA,and now in view of the more recent Westpac,72
NA,letters threats of Feez Ruthoning: where do,72
NA,they go? Particularly when negligence has,72
NA,been found against AGC Advances in the,72
NA,court decision.,72
NA,"In the interests of justice, legal aid should",72
NA,be given to provide competent representation,72
NA,"to Donkins, Potts, Porters and others. There",72
NA,is a need for the Treasurer ( Mr Willis) to,72
NA,follow through on a notice of motion that I,72
NA,"have initiated for debate in this House, which",72
NA,"stands on today's Notice Paper at No. 11,",72
NA,where I am suggesting that legal expenses be,72
NA,"non-tax deductible to banks, particularly in",72
NA,"these cases, so there can be some equality and",72
NA,justice.,72
NA,I have followed the case of the Donkins,72
NA,since it came to my notice after the inquiry.,72
NA,I have corresponded with the law section of,72
NA,the bank to argue the case and have received,72
NA,no satisfaction whatsoever. What can you,72
NA,argue against a bank's representative who,72
NA,"says, 'We have spent over $1 million on the",72
NA,particular Donkins' case and don't intend to,72
NA,"lose it now,' even to the point of prosecution",72
NA,"into bankruptcy, which was their answer?",72
NA,I have no doubt that the law section of,72
NA,Westpac act in isolation from the rest of the,72
NA,"bank whose only instruction is, apparently, to",72
NA,ensure that the Westpac letters are put to rest,72
NA,permanently and to ensure the statute of,72
NA,"limitations works in the bank's favour, which",72
NA,it currently is doing.,72
NA,My final observation on this whole matter,72
NA,is that neither the government nor the Reserve,72
NA,Bank is prepared to uphold its own legislation,73
NA,and regulations. In the Banking Act 1959,73
NA,"under 'Interpretation', 'prudential matters', in",73
NA,"relation to the bank, means, amongst other",73
NA,things:,73
NA,(i) to keep itself in a sound financial position;,73
NA,and,73
NA,(ii) not to cause or promote instability in the,73
NA,Australian financial system; and,73
NA,"(b) with integrity, prudence and professional skill;",73
NA,"The Westpac letters are evidence, as is an",73
NA,examination of the cases of Donkins and,73
NA,Potts. The recent letters of Feez Ruthoning,73
NA,prove that banks have no integrity in this,73
NA,"regard, no prudence, and had no professional",73
NA,skill when foreign currency loans were first,73
NA,marketed.,73
NA,I have placed questions on notice to the,73
NA,Reserve Bank to determine whether such,73
NA,Westpac practices should mean a review of,73
NA,the licence under which that bank operates,73
NA,with impunity from the law. In a recent letter,73
NA,to the Treasurer for intervention in the,73
NA,"Donkins' case, I received an answer from the",73
NA,Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Gear) who said that,73
NA,he had no right of intervention because of the,73
NA,separation of powers. I believe the Assistant,73
NA,"Treasurer is wrong. It is a matter for him, the",73
NA,Treasurer and the Reserve Bank to conduct a,73
NA,thorough examination of the bank's conduct,73
NA,that should affect the conduct of its licence.,73
NA,I believe that there should be a royal com-,73
NA,mission or a judicial inquiry into the Westpac,73
NA,letters; legal aid should be made available to,73
NA,litigants in the cases I have mentioned;,73
NA,consideration should be given to ensure that,73
NA,the bank's litigation expenses are not tax,73
NA,deductible; and a review should be undertaken,73
NA,of all banking licences on the basis of the,73
NA,prudential requirements of the act. (Time,73

NA,things are a lot better than they were when,73
NA,the now Leader of the Opposition was in,73
NA,"office and unemployment, interest rates and",73
NA,inflation were rampant.,73
NA,Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald was a,73
NA,"scream. On page 40, the Leader of the Oppo-",73
NA,sition says that a coalition-in the unlikely,73
NA,event of them gaining government-would,73
NA,require Telstra to speed up its national up-,73
NA,grade of telephone exchanges over the next,73
NA,"few years. However, on the previous page, his",73
NA,deputy lists 13 points in the coalition's eco-,73
NA,"nomic policy. Point number 10 says, 'Sell off",73
NA,Telstra.',73
NA,Maybe the Deputy Leader of the Opposition,73
NA,"( Mr Costello), a proud protege of John Stone,",73
NA,should have closer dialogue with his boss.,73
NA,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition makes,73
NA,a number of admissions in the Sydney Morn-,73
NA,ing Herald. He says he believes that modesty,73
NA,"is a virtue, and confesses that he is not a big",73
NA,spender.,73
NA,Yet the opposition is going around talking,73
NA,"to interest groups, or should I say self-interest",73
NA,"groups, and is giving a wink and a nod to",73
NA,"every group to whom they speak, but will not",73
NA,spell out where the money is coming from to,73
NA,fund the sweeteners that they are offering. No,73
NA,wonder the top end of town is pleased and no,73
NA,wonder the pensioners and welfare recipients,73
NA,are terrified. Look out Medicare-smash!,73
NA,Look out child care-smash! Look out age,73
NA,care-smash! Look out equity and fairness.,73
NA,And look out workers. It is no wonder that,73
NA,Labor is surging back in the opinion polls.,73
NA,"However, enough of political debate. It is",73
NA,"nearing Christmas, a time of peace and",73
NA,goodwill and I am sure people would not,73
NA,mind a change of pace. I know all members,73
NA,are most anxious to hear of the good things,73
NA,that are happening in the electorate of Hunter,73
NA,"where the very best wines are produced,",73
NA,where the people are the friendliest and where,74
NA,caring people cooperate to help their area,74
NA,prosper.,74
NA,"Besides mines, wines and people, the",74
NA,"Hunter has dairy and beef cattle, wool, grains",74
NA,and horses. Let me teIl you a story about,74
NA,horses. There are many splendid thoroughbred,74
NA,horse studs in Scone and throughout the,74
NA,remainder of the vaIley and these studs and,74
NA,horse racing are integral features of the,74
NA,Hunter VaIley tourism industry.,74
NA,The good people of Scone regard their,74
NA,beautiful town as the horse capital of Austral-,74
NA,"ia, but others would have disputed their right",74
NA,to that title until this year. That title will,74
NA,be disputed after recent funding grants. Earlier,74
NA,this year the federal government granted $5,74
NA,million for a new T AFE college at Scone,74
NA,which will have subjects oriented to the horse,74
NA,breeding industry. Then the state government,74
NA,came along and funded $6 million for a,74
NA,"beautiful new racecourse in Scone. Then, last",74
NA,"Friday, Minister Howe made a grant of",74
NA,"$3.185 million for an equine research centre,",74
NA,and that was all federally funded.,74
NA,Members will understand that this is a,74
NA,"development of regional, state, national and",74
NA,even international significance. The state,74
NA,government has also provided money for the,74
NA,building of 400 horse stables. The courses,74
NA,which will be put on the curriculum at the,74
NA,Scone TAFE will draw students from through-,74
NA,out Asia and throughout the world. This will,74
NA,be a massive boost for the whole Hunter,74
NA,"Valley, and Australia will benefit greatly as",74
NA,a result.,74
NA,Last Friday evening I went to a celebration,74
NA,dinner for the Johns brothers-Matthew and,74
NA,Andrew. The Johns brothers come from,74
NA,"Cessnock, the town in which I live. Cessnock",74
NA,has produced three rugby league internation-,74
NA,"als: Frank Stanmore, Dave Parkinson and Don",74
NA,"Schofield. Because my wife, Anne, had taught",74
NA,"both Matthew and Andrew in kindergarten,",74
NA,she gave a great speech and told what they,74
NA,were like as young lads. But she made a,74
NA,dreadful mistake. With about 350 people,74
NA,"there, she admitted, she confessed, she stated",74
NA,"quite clearly, that she hated rugby league. She",74
NA,forgot to explain it was because she had to,74
NA,wash my dirty washing when I played and she,74
NA,had to wash the dirty garments when her two,74
NA,"sons, Mark and Joel, played. But it was a",74
NA,great night.,74
NA,"While on the topic of sport, I want to",74
NA,"mention Kurri Kurri, which is only a couple",74
NA,of kilometres down the road from my place.,74
NA,"This year, in the very strong Newcastle rugby",74
NA,"league competition, Kurri won its third",74
NA,straight first grade premiership-three first,74
NA,"grade premierships, year after year. It is a",74
NA,magnificent team and a magnificent achieve-,74
NA,ment for a relatively small town such as Kurri,74
NA,"Kurri. Not surprisingly, Kurri has produced",74
NA,more rugby league internationals than any,74
NA,not other town in Australia-I think the number,74
NA,"is 10 or II-and, rightly, those people are so",74
NA,very proud of their rugby league prowess.,74
NA,We do not only excel in rugby league in the,74
NA,"Hunter. Steve Merrick, from the Singleton",74
NA,"Rugby Club, represented Australia in this",74
NA,year's Bledisloe Cup. Singleton was premier,74
NA,in the very strong Newcastle competition. It,74
NA,won the premiership this year for the second,74
NA,year in a row. This year's win was more,74
NA,scintillating than last year's because Singleton,74
NA,went through the competition undefeated. This,74
NA,"year the small town of Weston won the first,",74
NA,reserve and under-21 years premierships in,74
NA,the Northern New South Wales state soccer,74
NA,competition. Weston is the first ever club to,74
NA,achieve this feat. These are just a few of the,74
NA,sporting achievements within my electorate.,74
NA,Further up the valley in small towns like,74
NA,"Quirindi, Willow Tree, Murrurundi, Muswell-",74
NA,"brook, Merriwa, Denman and Sandy Hollow",74
NA,the young people are right into their sport.,74
NA,What better way in which to engage them-,74
NA,selves than to engage in sports of all kinds.,74
NA,Every sport imaginable is played in the,74
NA,Hunter. Every week I enjoy picking up the,74
NA,paper and reading of some outstanding,74
NA,achievement by some youngster in primary,74
NA,"school or secondary school, or by some other",74
NA,"young person who is excelling. Last Saturday,",74
NA,I officially opened the swimming season at,74
NA,the Kurri Kurri swimming pool.,74
Mr REID ,"A very important sport, too.",74
Mr FITZGIBBON,It is a very important,74
NA,sport. I must congratulate Kurri for its won-,74
NA,derful efforts over the years in training and,74
NA,"presenting so many champions. In netbaIl,",74
NA,"cricket and tennis, the Hunter is a great",75
NA,nursery for sporting stars.,75
NA,I mentioned Singleton a while ago. The,75
NA,"Singleton council, in cooperation with com-",75
NA,"munity groups, with all the fervour imagi-",75
NA,nable is pursuing funds so that they can,75
NA,establish a 50-metre pool-not a 25-metre,75
NA,"heated pool, which we are fortunate enough",75
NA,to have here in Parliament House. If you are,75
NA,"going to become a champion in swimming,",75
NA,you must have the opportunity to train in a,75
NA,50-metre pool. (Time expired),75
NA,Small Business,75
Mr REID ,Bendigo) (5.10 p.m.)-I wish to,75
NA,"grieve for the more than 860,000 small",75
NA,"businesses in Australia, particularly those in",75
NA,"the rural and regional areas, for the treatment",75
NA,they have received at the hands of the,75
NA,Keating federal government. A recent Yellow,75
NA,Pages small business survey reveals that the,75
NA,Keating federal government's policies are,75
NA,working against their best interests. The Small,75
NA,business index is the largest economic survey,75
NA,of small business in Australia and focuses,75
NA,specifically on businesses employing 19,75
NA,people or fewer.,75
NA,Interviewing for this survey was conducted,75
NA,over the period from 24 October to 7 Novem-,75
NA,"ber 1995, so it is current. The index used a",75
NA,"panel of at least 1,200 randomly-selected",75
NA,"small business proprietors, who were inter-",75
NA,viewed by telephone every three months. The,75
NA,"panel, drawn from all metropolitan and non-",75
NA,"metropolitan regions of Australia, tapped into",75
NA,"non-metropolitan regions of Australia, which",75
NA,makes this quite unique.,75
NA,The areas of activity tapped into cover,75
NA,manufacturing; building and construction;,75
NA,"wholesale/retail; transport, storage; finance,",75
NA,"property and business services; and recreation,",75
NA,personal and other services. One omission,75
NA,from that would be the farming sector. Small,75
NA,business and farmers go hand in hand. They,75
NA,operate as small business people. This survey,75
NA,"involved 1,200 people in total. In the",75
NA,"metropolitan area, 910 people were surveyed;",75
NA,"in the non-metropolitan areas, 290 people",75
NA,were surveyed. That gives an indication of the,75
NA,breadth of this survey and its findings.,75
NA,The attitudes in this survey to federal,75
NA,government policy are what makes this quite,75
NA,a remarkable and very active document.,75
NA,Reasons why proprietors of these businesses,75
NA,view the federal government as un supportive,75
NA,were also canvassed in the November 1995,75
NA,survey. According to the survey:,75
NA,Lack of incentive is the number one concem-,75
NA,voiced by 24% of those who find Federal Govern-,75
NA,ment policies to be working against small business.,75
NA,"Taxation issues are also high on the agenda, with",75
NA,"many complaining about too many taxes, too high",75
NA,taxes or specific taxes such as sales tax.,75
NA,We all know how the Keating government has,75
NA,increased wholesale sales tax since it came,75
NA,back into government in 1993. The survey,75
NA,continues:,75
NA,Bureaucracy and a limited understanding of small,75
NA,"business needs also figure prominently, as does",75
NA,concern about IR policies or unfair dismissal,75
NA,"legislation. Grouping similar responses, reveals the",75
NA,following hierarchy of concerns:,75
NA,Taxes (33%),75
NA,Bureaucracy/red tape/paperwork (26%),75
NA,Lack of incentives (24%),75
NA,Lack of understanding/only concerned with big,75
NA,business (20%),75
NA,Industrial relations policies (18 %),75
NA,· Government charges (15%),75
NA,· Superannuation (13%).,75
NA,Is it any wonder that that attitude comes,75
NA,through from small business throughout,75
NA,Australia? The member for Pearce ( Mrs,75
NA,"Moylan), in debate on a matter of public",75
NA,"importance, stated:",75
NA,· . . the Prime Minister ( Mr Keating) in all his,75
NA,arrogance-at the height of arrogance--decIared to,75
NA,"small business, 'This is as good as it gets. What are",75
NA,you complaining about? If you cannot make it in,75
NA,"this climate, go out and get yourselves a PA YE",75
NA,job.',75
NA,Is it any wonder that the federal government,75
NA,is held in very scant regard by small business,75
NA,in Australia? It becomes even worse when the,75
NA,Leader of the Government in the Senate,75
NA,"(Senator Gareth Evans), during the early part",75
NA,"of November, said:",75
NA,The best possible thing this government could do,75
NA,for small business is to create an economic environ-,75
NA,ment in which small business can flourish-,75
NA,I do not disagree with that-,75
NA,a climate of sustained growth. which we are,76
NA,managing to do with 30f a per cent growth this,76
NA,year; a low inflation environment; an interest rate,76
NA,environment that is extremely modest by any,76
NA,previous comparison . . . and activity because,76
NA,business is profitable at the moment.,76
NA,How far out of touch can Senator Gareth,76
NA,Evans be? He says:,76
NA,... business is profitable at the moment-,76
NA,You have only to look at the Yellow Pages,76
NA,"index and survey of 1,200 businesses through-",76
NA,out Australia to know that that is not correct.,76
NA,Senator Evans goes on to say:,76
NA,Business confidence is high at the moment and,76
NA,consumer confidence is high.,76
NA,"If you talk to small business people, you will",76
NA,find that nothing could be further from the,76
NA,"truth. Obviously, the people from Yellow",76
NA,Pages have been talking to small business,76
NA,people and have found that quite the reverse,76
NA,is the situation: small business people have,76
NA,absolutely no confidence in what the govern-,76
NA,"ment is doing. In the survey, small business",76
NA,people were asked:,76
NA,Thinking about the current Federal Government-,76
NA,do you believe that their current economic and,76
NA,other policies are supportive of small business.,76
NA,work against small business or have no real impact,76
NA,either way?,76
NA,The overwhelming response was that the,76
NA,policies of the federal government worked,76
NA,"against small business. Lack of incentives,",76
NA,"high taxes, bureaucracy, lack of understand-",76
NA,"ing, industrial relations policy, government",76
NA,charges and superannuation are just some of,76
NA,"the issues that were mentioned, and men-",76
NA,tioned very strongly.,76
NA,I refer to page 13 of the Yellow Pages,76
NA,"index, where the following question was",76
NA,asked:,76
NA,What do you think is the number one national issue,76
NA,that the (Federal) elected government should,76
NA,address?,76
NA,"Unemployment rates as the highest, with 28",76
NA,per cent. Small business people recognise-as,76
NA,do I-that they are one of the greatest cre-,76
NA,ators of employment opportunities. They said,76
NA,that the greatest concern for the federal,76
NA,government or any future federal government,76
NA,would be to get on top of unemployment. On,76
NA,page 7 of today' s Financial Review-Monday,76
NA,27 November 1995-the Australian Chamber,76
NA,of Commerce and Industry said:,76
NA,Business perceives the economy as more brittle,76
NA,"than a year ago, with profitability slowing, accord-",76
NA,ing to the latest survey of its members by the,76
NA,Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.,76
NA,But members of the Victorian Employers',76
NA,Chamber of Commerce and Industry provide a,76
NA,more positive outlook in their survey. also released,76
NA,at the weekend.,76
NA,Even more businesses-45 per cent-xpect the,76
NA,Victorian economy to experience similarly im-,76
NA,proved growth during the next 12 months.,76
NA,Trends in employment growth have also im-,76
NA,"proved. according to the VECCI members, despite",76
NA,overall recent adverse job trends in Australia that,76
NA,have been more marked in Victoria.,76
NA,Due to the strong coalition government in,76
NA,"Victoria, things in that state are improving.",76
NA,But business in the rest of Australia perceive,76
NA,that the economy is more brittle than a year,76
NA,ago and that profitability is slowing.,76
NA,It is a travesty that the federal government,76
NA,has created this situation for small business in,76
NA,Australia. It has certainly let small business,76
NA,down. When help was needed during the,76
NA,really tough period when interest rates were,76
NA,"escalating, the Labor government failed small",76
NA,business. It failed the community. This is,76
NA,borne out by the massive swing away from,76
NA,the Keating government by the small business,76
NA,"sector in Australia, which recognised that",76
NA,when it was in trouble no help was forth-,76
NA,coming from the federal government. (Time,76
NA,expired),76
NA,Higher Education,76
Mr LES SCOTT ,Oxley) (5.20 p.m.)-,76
NA,This afternoon I would like to take the oppor-,76
NA,tunity to speak a little bit about higher educa-,76
NA,"tion places, particularly in Queensland. Hav-",76
NA,"ing lived in Queensland all of my life, I know",76
NA,what it was like growing up in rather tough,76
NA,times under a National Party government--or,76
NA,Country Party government as they used to call,76
NA,it in Queensland in those days-where your,76
NA,chance of going on to tertiary education was,76
NA,"almost nil. As a reasonably small boy, only",76
NA,two people that I can remember actually had,76
NA,the opportunity to go on to university educa-,76
NA,tion from the struggling backgrounds that we,77
NA,were raised in.,77
NA,It is no wonder that I myself and a lot of,77
NA,people of my generation have had going on,77
NA,to tertiary education as one of the primary,77
NA,objectives for our children. I think we can be,77
NA,very proud of the efforts of this particular,77
NA,"government, and certainly it goes back to the",77
NA,Whitlam government as well. In my own,77
NA,"family, I have seen my own sons take the",77
NA,opportunity and the advantage of that to study,77
NA,and to work hard to achieve things. But it has,77
NA,all been done through the assistance of a very,77
NA,concerned government.,77
NA,It is no wonder that a lot of people in my,77
NA,Queensland electorate over the weekend,77
NA,spoke to me about their concerns over the,77
NA,Senate's rejection of certain aspects of the,77
NA,government's budget that relate to additional,77
NA,university places for Queensland. When the,77
NA,"budget came down in May this year, I sent",77
NA,out a newsletter to my electorate. I will just,77
NA,read some of the relevant points that I made,77
NA,in that newsletter. This is what I said to the,77
NA,electorate on this occasion:,77
NA,The 1995-96 Commonwealth Budget has provid-,77
NA,ed added impetus to the push for a University,77
NA,Campus in Ipswich by providing $2 million in 1997,77
NA,to help with the cost of setting up the campus of,77
NA,the University of Queensland.,77
NA,The Federal Budget proved to be very generous,77
NA,to Queensland in terms of education. Of an extra,77
NA,"5,850 additional higher education places nationwide",77
NA,"being funded out of the Budget, 4,200 will go to",77
NA,Queensland. This is in addition to the 500 extra,77
NA,places set aside by the Government in last year's,77
NA,planning for the three year period of funding from,77
NA,1996-98.,77
NA,After many years of lobbying by the Queensland-,77
NA,based Federal Parliamentarians and the Queensland,77
NA,"Government, a long-standing imbalance against",77
NA,Queensland in the area of higher education has,77
NA,"been addressed in this Budget, which recognises the",77
NA,need for increased opportunities for young people,77
NA,in rapidly growing areas like Queensland.,77
NA,425 extra places will be provided for the,77
NA,"sity of Queensland, with the majority of these",77
NA,expected to be set aside for the Ipswich campus.,77
NA,I want to focus on the Ipswich campus issue.,77
NA,Ipswich is one of the largest provincial cities,77
NA,in Queensland. It is probably the only provin-,77
NA,"cial city without a university campus, and that",77
NA,is a disgrace. It is a disgrace that previous,77
NA,state governments have not had the commit-,77
NA,ment to establish a campus in a city the size,77
NA,of Ipswich. I know that my predecessor,77
NA,worked very hard for the campus as well but,77
NA,could not convince the then state government.,77
NA,"Fortunately, I have had the opportunity of",77
NA,being a member under a Labor state govern-,77
NA,ment which has worked very hard for this. I,77
NA,compliment the Minister for Education in,77
NA,"Queensland, David Hamill, for his assistance",77
NA,"in this as well. He, I and many others have",77
NA,worked extremely hard to get the acknowledg-,77
NA,"ment of a campus to go into Ipswich. Sadly,",77
NA,I find out that the Senate rejecting the funding,77
NA,bills last week puts at risk this very aspect. It,77
NA,is a major concern to my local community.,77
NA,Ms Crawford-Shame!,77
NA,Mr LES SCOTTI notice that the parlia-,77
NA,"mentary secretary at the table, the member for",77
NA,"Forde, Mary Crawford, also acknowledges",77
NA,that by her interjection of 'Shame!' It is a,77
NA,shame on the National-Liberal party opposi-,77
NA,"tion. They should be in opposition, and I am",77
NA,sure they will be after the next election. From,77
NA,"the way they are carrying on here, you can",77
NA,see that they have no commitment to Queens-,77
NA,land whatsoever. For many years the National,77
NA,Party government in Queensland was prepared,77
NA,to go along that same way.,77
NA,I compliment the Commonwealth Minister,77
NA,"for Employment, Education and Training ( Mr",77
NA,"Crean), who was prepared to acknowledge the",77
NA,need for more funding and places in Queens-,77
NA,"land. I mentioned before, in that article that",77
NA,"I put out after the budget, the $2 million that",77
NA,"has been provided. However, since then",77
NA,another $6.5 million has been allocated for,77
NA,"that campus in Ipswich, which shows strong",77
NA,support by the government and its commit-,77
NA,ment to the establishment of that campus.,77
NA,"Last week, as soon as I heard about the",77
NA,"Senate's rejection of the higher education bill,",77
NA,I put out a statement calling on the Queens-,77
NA,Univerland National and Liberal Party senators to,77
NA,"cross the floor on this issue, because they",77
NA,ought to if they have any commitment to the,77
NA,state of Queensland whatever. I think we can,77
NA,prove that they have already shown that they,77
NA,do not have any commitment to Queensland.,77
NA,Perhaps the coalition members in this place,77
NA,should also come over and vote with us when,77
NA,the legislation comes back for debate later in,78
NA,the week. I will certainly hop up and speak in,78
NA,support of it. It will affect not only the young,78
NA,people in my electorate but the young people,78
NA,right throughout Queensland.,78
NA,All those young people out there today-I,78
NA,hope they are listening to this debate this,78
NA,afternoon-who are finishing year 12 this,78
NA,"year have a lot of concern about this, because",78
NA,it is going to put at risk those places in,78
NA,"Queensland. I can assure them, and I will take",78
NA,the risk of speaking on behalf of all my Labor,78
NA,"colleagues, that we are very concerned for",78
NA,their welfare and are working strongly to do,78
NA,"something about the matter. Just today, we",78
NA,have joined forces and put out a joint press,78
NA,statement. I congratulate my Labor Party,78
NA,colleagues from Queensland who were pre-,78
NA,pared to put their names to this joint news,78
NA,"release, supporting the government in its push",78
NA,for more places in Queensland. That media,78
NA,release headed 'Coalition must reverse block,78
NA,of new uni places' states:,78
NA,Queensland's Labor Senators and Members have,78
NA,demanded that the Federal Coalition reverse its,78
NA,"decision to block funding for the State's 4,200",78
NA,university places.,78
NA,The Labor MPs have warned they will hound,78
NA,Coalition MPs and candidates all the way to the,78
NA,ballot box and make sure every Queensland voter,78
NA,knows it was the Liberal and National parties that,78
NA,may have stopped Queensland from getting its fair,78
NA,share of university places.,78
NA,I am certainly joining forces with my col-,78
NA,leagues in pushing that line. I am a bit sur-,78
NA,prised that the Liberal and National Party,78
NA,members in my own electorate have not come,78
NA,out and shown their true colours on this. Or,78
NA,"are their true colours hidden, like the federal",78
NA,"coalition's policies are? Quite clearly, the city",78
NA,of Ipswich needs a university campus. It is,78
NA,something that we are all fighting for. I,78
NA,challenge all those Liberal and National Party,78
NA,members-if there are any left around Ips-,78
NA,wich-to come out and show their true,78
NA,colours on this. If they have any decency,78
NA,"about them at all, they should take on their",78
NA,own party on this issue. In this press state-,78
NA,"ment, we have gone on to say that we have:",78
NA,"... urged all school-Ieavers, parents and teachers",78
NA,to phone-reverse charges-Liberal and National,78
NA,Party Senators and Members today demanding they,78
NA,pass the Government's legislation which funds the,78
NA,additional places.,78
NA,The Federal Labor Government will reintroduce,78
NA,the funding Bills into the Senate later this week to,78
NA,provide Queensland with the first round of 1750,78
NA,new university places for next year.,78
NA,If the Coalition blocks the funding again Queens-,78
NA,land may miss out on some of the places.,78
NA,This is the one issue where there should be,78
NA,complete bi-partisan support. Queensland and,78
NA,young Queenslanders are the beneficiaries.,78
NA,"They are the future of our nation, they are the",78
NA,"future of our state, and they deserve better",78
NA,support. It continues:,78
NA,Students who have put in years of hard work and,78
NA,study and are now awaiting their offers from,78
NA,universities are entitled to be outraged at the,78
NA,Coalition's cheap political stunts.,78
NA,That is all it is. I would urge them all to call,78
NA,any Liberal senators and members they may,78
NA,know around the place. If they want to know,78
NA,"who they are, they can certainly let my office",78
NA,"know. I am sure that, if they let any other",78
NA,"government members' offices know, my",78
NA,colleagues will also push very strongly to,78
NA,new assist in highlighting just how hopeless these,78
NA,"people are in the coalition, particularly in",78

NA,I call on the Australian Democrats and the,78
NA,Greens to also have a bit of concern for,78
NA,"Queensland, particularly when it comes to",78
NA,ensuring that that funding legislation is passed,78
NA,by the Senate. If the Liberals and Nationals,78
NA,"are not prepared to come around to it, I",78
NA,certainly hope that the Democrats and the,78
NA,Greens will. That will ensure that the legisla-,78
NA,tion passes the Senate next time around.,78
NA,It is a very crucial issue for the state of,78
NA,Queensland; it is a very crucial issue for the,78
NA,future education of our children. While I,78
NA,admit that I speak about it from a very selfish,78
NA,point of view looking at the education of my,78
NA,"own children, I think that I reflect average",78
NA,Queenslanders in a lot of ways through the,78
NA,"backgrounds that we have, particularly those",78
NA,who have children of tertiary age. I know that,78
NA,they will support very strongly the push that,78
NA,we are making. I thank the House for the,78
NA,opportunity to raise this issue today. I call on,78
NA,all Queenslanders to remind anyone in the,78

Mr STEPHEN SMITH ,Perth)-by,81
NA,leave-I take this opportunity to briefly,81
NA,advise the House about the progress of the,81
NA,remaining current reference of the Joint,81
NA,Standing Committee on Corporations and,81
NA,Securities-the role of Australian investors in,81
NA,Australia's capital markets. The committee,81
NA,had initially intended to report on this refer-,81
NA,ence during the current year. A substantial,81
NA,"part of the inquiry, however, relates to corpo-",81
NA,"rate governance matters, both generally and",81
NA,as corporate governance relates to institutional,81
NA,investors. Given recent events in this area,81
NA,there are a number of important corporate,81
NA,"governance matters still evolving. As a result,",81
NA,the committee has resolved not to report this,81
NA,year but to refer committee materials relating,81
NA,"to the reference, including background materi-",81
NA,"al, written submissions and evidence to the",81
NA,joint committee established in the next parlia-,81
NA,ment.,81
NA,I also take the opportunity to advise the,81
NA,House that the committee recently resolved,81
NA,that the issue of corporate codes of conduct,81
NA,by Australian corporations operating in,81
NA,"overseas countries, such as Papua New",81
NA,"Guinea, is of sufficient importance for the",81
NA,committee secretariat to now commence,81
NA,background research. Background research,81
NA,will include: how Australian corporations,81
NA,operating overseas treat their employees in,81
NA,those countries; whether Australian corpora-,81
NA,tions operating overseas adhere satisfactorily,81
NA,to internationally accepted standards of,81
NA,workplace safety and health; what practices,81
NA,Australian corporations adopt for the protec-,81
NA,tion of the environment and human rights;,81
NA,how Australian corporations and industry,81
NA,groups are approaching the developing need,81
NA,for codes; and the development of codes in,81
NA,other jurisdictions. The committee expects,81
NA,that the results of the research currently under,81
NA,way will assist the joint committee established,81
NA,in the next parliament.,81
NA,I take this opportunity to thank the mem-,81
NA,bers of the Joint Committee on Corporations,81
NA,and Securities and the committee secretariat,81
NA,for the work done this year in the course of,81
NA,preparing five reports for presentation to the,81
NA,parliament.,81
Mr SINCLAIR ,New England)-by,81
NA,leave-The opposition concurs in the recom-,81
NA,mendations of the Chairman of the Joint,81
NA,"Committee on Corporations and Securities,",81
NA,the honourable member for Perth ( Mr Stephen,81
NA,"Smith), on both issues. The first issue con-",81
NA,cerns the proposed inquiry into institutional,81
NA,"investors. It would seem that, given the",81
NA,circumstances surrounding developments in,81
NA,the Coles Myer company and also in the,81
NA,general field of developments in superannua-,81
NA,"tion, the subject does require careful and",81
NA,deliberate consideration. The obvious challen-,81
NA,ges in proceeding into this issue make it,81
NA,inappropriate that the inquiry is pursued at,81
NA,this time. All members of the committee,81
NA,"believe it appropriate, therefore, that the",81
NA,hearings into the institutional investors should,81
NA,be deferred. We would ask the incoming,81
NA,government to make a similar reference to the,81
NA,successor of this committee in the next parlia-,81
NA,ment.,81
NA,With respect to the matter of the behaviour,81
NA,"of corporations in surrounding countries, there",81
NA,is a belief that it is appropriate-not just in,81
NA,the field of industrial laws but in corporate,81
NA,governance generally-that there are matters,81
NA,that need to be addressed. They are issues,81
NA,which enable the committee secretariat to,81
NA,collate information which can then be con-,81
NA,"sidered and, if necessary, reported on again-",81
NA,probably in the next parliament. For that,81
NA,reason the members of the coalition support,81
NA,the statement made by the chairman of the,81
NA,committee. We believe that both issues allow,81
NA,some proper and considered investigations in,81
NA,the 34th parliament rather than in this parliaNew,82
NA,ment. I therefore support the statement made,82
NA,by the honourable member for Perth.,82
NA,Native Title and the Aboriginal and,82

NA,Committee,82
NA,Report,82
Mr QUICK ,Franklin)-On behalf of the,82
NA,Joint Committee on Native Title and the,82
NA,Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land,82
NA,Fund I present the third report of the commit-,82
NA,tee entitled Committee exchange with New,82
NA,Zealand-August 1995.,82
NA,Ordered that the report be printed.,82
Mr QUICK,by leave-I appreciate this,82
NA,brief opportunity to speak on the report. Four,82
NA,members of the parliamentary Joint Commit-,82
NA,tee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and,82
NA,Torres Strait Islander Land Fund visited New,82
NA,Zealand in August this year at the invitation,82
NA,of the Speaker of the New Zealand House of,82
NA,Representatives and as part of the committee,82
NA,exchange program between our two countries.,82
NA,As 1995 is the Maori language year the,82
NA,"Speaker, the Hon. Peter Tapsell, indicated that",82
NA,indigenous land rights would be an appropri-,82
NA,ate topic for an exchange by our committee,82
NA,when we visited New Zealand. The commit-,82
NA,tee's report is a great little report on the,82
NA,committee's deliberations and its fact-finding,82
NA,"tour of the North Island of New Zealand, and",82
NA,it is well worth reading.,82
NA,The committee members spent a very busy,82
NA,3Y2 days in the North Island almost totally,82
NA,immersed in all aspects of Maori culture. The,82
NA,visit provided us with an unprecedented,82
NA,opportunity to meet everybody involved in,82
NA,Maori affairs-be they responsible govern-,82
NA,"ment ministers, parliamentary backbenchers,",82
NA,"local Maori women in health centres, opera-",82
NA,"tors of Maori FM radio stations, the Maori",82
NA,"Queen, young Maori activists or teachers in",82
NA,Maori immersion schools.,82
NA,Not only were we rapidly brought up to,82
NA,speed with the historical background of Maori,82
NA,affairs but we were soon involved in the,82
NA,current and ongoing machinations revolving,82
NA,around Maori land claims resulting from the,82
NA,Zealand government's $1 billion fiscal,82
NA,envelope offer-an offer that was made in an,82
NA,attempt to settle the whole issue of Maori,82
NA,land claims once and for all.,82
NA,We were fortunate to spend the early part,82
NA,of the trip in the lands of the Waikato-Tainui,82
NA,"tribe, who were finalising the details of a",82
NA,settlement with the government. The redress,82
NA,value of the settlement to the Tainui people,82
NA,"is to the value of $NZ170 million, with in",82
NA,"excess of 29,000 acres of settlement land and",82
NA,"an additional 8,000-odd acres of improved",82
NA,land being transferred together with some,82
NA,$NZ60 million.,82
NA,As well as seeing the practical side to the,82
NA,"whole issue of land rights, we were fortunate",82
NA,to be taken through the gamut of New Zea-,82
NA,"land native title. The Treaty of Waitangi, the",82
NA,"Maori Land Court, the Waitangi Tribunal, the",82
NA,"Office of Treaty Settlements, the Maori",82
NA,"Fisheries Act, the Maori Language Act and",82
NA,the Maori Affairs Committee were all ex-,82
NA,plained to us in great detail as we were taken,82
NA,theoretically and practically through the,82
NA,development of land tenure in New Zealand,82
NA,since white settlement.,82
NA,Comparisons between what was happening,82
NA,in our two countries were constantly made as,82
NA,we sought to elicit answers from each other,82
NA,in the expectation that we could all benefit,82
NA,from each other's experiences on this native,82
NA,title issue. These discussions proved to be,82
NA,very beneficial not only to our committee,82
NA,members but to the people we met and had,82
NA,discussions with in New Zealand.,82
NA,To those people in New Zealand and,82
NA,Australia who are interested in the whole,82
NA,"issue of native title, this slim but very valu-",82
NA,able report makes very interesting reading-as,82
NA,I stated at the outset-as it details a very,82
NA,comprehensive outline of what is happening,82
NA,"with native title in New Zealand. Finally, I",82
NA,would like to express my thanks to the com-,82
NA,mittee members who accompanied me to New,82
NA,"Zealand--especially Senator Chris Evans, the",82
NA,chair of the committee-and to the committee,82
NA,"secretariat, especially Peter Grundy, for the",82
NA,assistance they provided to members and,82
NA,senators during the trip and later for compil-,82
NA,ing this wonderful report. I thank the House.,82

NA,"Debate resumed from 22 November, on",83
NA,motion by Ms Crawford:,83
NA,That the bill be now read a second time.,83
Mr OCONNOR ,Corio) (5.44 p.m.)-It,83
NA,gives me great pleasure to rise in the House,83
NA,and speak on the debate of these appropri-,83
NA,ation bills. The function of government is to,83
NA,raise revenue and appropriate it to competing,83
NA,purposes. That is what the process of politics,83
NA,"is all about. Lobby groups, individuals and",83
NA,businesses come to Canberra to lobby mem-,83
NA,bers and the government for those particular,83
NA,allocations. All of those people make particu-,83
NA,lar claims on the government.,83
NA,Canberra is indeed the clearing house for,83
NA,those various demands and pressures within,83
NA,the political process. Recently we had a good,83
NA,"example of this, with a delegation from",83
NA,Geelong visiting Canberra to lobby on behalf,83
NA,"of the city and region of Geelong, which I",83
NA,represent in this parliament. That Geelong,83
NA,delegation consisted of Councillor Gerry,83
NA,"Smith, the Mayor of the city of Geelong, the",83
NA,"Secretary of the Trades Hall Council, John",83
NA,"Kranz, and Cathy Roth, the President of the",83
NA,"Geelong Chamber of Commerce, representing",83
NA,employers. They were accompanied by two,83
NA,"officials, Michael Malouf and Neil Savery.",83
NA,The delegation was very well received by,83
NA,senior ministers. I use this opportunity on,83
NA,floor of the House to thank those ministers,83
NA,their generosity in consenting to meet the,83
NA,delegation. The delegation was put together,83
NA,in a difficult period. We have recently come,83
NA,through some serious floods in Geelong. The,83
NA,officers were working around the clock,83
NA,dealing with matters relating to the floods and,83
NA,preparing the documentation for the delega-,83
NA,"tion's visit, which had been arranged some",83
NA,time ahead of the floods. It was a magnificent,83
NA,effort. I pay tribute to the staff: Michael,83
NA,"Malouf, the CEO of the city of greater Gee-",83
NA,"long, Neville MCPherson, Neil Savery and",83
NA,Richard Walker and all those other people,83
NA,who contributed to the fine documentation,83
NA,that the city was able to present to senior,83
NA,ministers. The community owes them a debt,83
NA,of gratitude. I have had one minister request,83
NA,five copies of the presentation that we made,83
NA,to ministers. He wants to take it back to his,83
NA,own electorate and show his municipalities.,83
NA,That documentation was professionally done,83
NA,and the information was professionally pre-,83
NA,sented to ministers by the delegation.,83
NA,An important feature of the government's,83
NA,recent budgetary reallocations has been the,83
NA,funding of the Building Better Cities program.,83
NA,Recently the government allocated some $247,83
NA,"million over a six-year period to this program,",83
NA,$36 million for strategic studies and $200,83
NA,miIIion to capital grants. Those capital grants,83
NA,can be made to fund infrastructure investment,83
NA,in the form of economic gateways or to,83
NA,finance urban growth centres and redevelop-,83
NA,ment in areas of high urban growth.,83
NA,The program has been particularly benefi-,83
NA,"cial to Geelong. As members would know, the",83
NA,Building Better Cities program is organised,83
NA,along area strategy lines. Geelong is situated,83
NA,in the south-west corridor of Victoria for the,83
NA,purposes of the Building Better Cities pro-,83
NA,gram. The aims of the strategy in that corridor,83
NA,are to support the growth of areas around,83
NA,Werribee in that corridor and to revitalise the,83
NA,central area of Geelong and its foreshore.,83
NA,There have been some major achievements of,83
NA,the Building Better Cities strategy in the,83
NA,south-west corridor. The completion of the,83
NA,Australian Food and Research Institute in,83
NA,Werribee and the completion of physical,83
NA,the infrastructure works around the institute and,83
NA,for the technology precinct have been important,83
NA,achievements. We have seen also the upgrad-,83
NA,ing of the Melbourne-Werribee-Geelong,83
NA,railway line and the completion of the Nor-,83
NA,lane Estate urban redevelopment in Geelong.,83
NA,Two projects that are under way and near-,83
NA,ing completion are the Deakin wool stores,83
NA,refurbishment and the transport interchange,83
NA,on the Geelong foreshore. It is these two,83
NA,projects to which I would like to make specif-,83
NA,ic reference here because they tie in very,83
NA,neatly with the strategy of the Building Better,84
NA,Cities program to act as catalytic develop-,84
NA,ments for further investment and develop-,84
NA,ments in particular areas. As far as this area,84
NA,"of Geeiong is concerned, for many years the",84
NA,foreshore development along and around,84
NA,Corio Bay has been almost non-existent. The,84
NA,"federal government, in concert with the",84
NA,"previous Cain and Kirner governments, was",84
NA,determined that this area could be the focus,84
NA,for a growth strategy and a catalytic develop-,84
NA,ment on the Geelong foreshore area. It has,84
NA,indeed done that. The Deakin wool stores and,84
NA,the transport interchange areas have been the,84
NA,catalyst for further study and development of,84
NA,that foreshore area. The current state govern-,84
NA,ment in Victoria has allocated some $20,84
NA,million to foreshore development and the,84
NA,private developments in the area are anticipat-,84
NA,ed over a number of years to be in excess of,84
NA,$200 million. It all started from the Building,84
NA,Better Cities program funded by a Labor,84
NA,government and two strategically placed,84
NA,developments on the Geelong foreshore.,84
NA,The benefits of these projects have been,84
NA,substantial in Geelong. We have seen the,84
NA,creation of employment in the building,84
NA,industry. Local firms have been involved in,84
NA,the construction of these projects. They have,84
NA,strengthened these enterprises in an economic,84
NA,sense and given them some expertise in,84
NA,"handling larger projects. Furthermore, Gee-",84
NA,long suppliers have benefited greatly from the,84
NA,purchases of local contractors who have been,84
NA,involved in the project. The overall benefit,84
NA,the Geelong community has been the regen-,84
NA,eration of this area of the foreshore.,84
NA,This brings me to a rather sad element of,84
NA,"this development, and that is the criticisms",84
NA,that have been levelled at it in the Better,84
NA,Cities program by the honourable member for,84
NA,Corangamite ( Mr MCArthur). He has attempt-,84
NA,ed in press releases to the Geelong Advertiser,84
NA,and other media outlets to denigrate this,84
NA,program. He recently claimed in a press,84
NA,release that the Auditor-General ought to,84
NA,investigate the Building Better Cities program,84
NA,on the basis that the funding went to Labor,84
NA,electorates. In the Geelong region it would be,84
NA,a little tough for me to locate the Geelong,84
NA,transport interchange over the other side of,84
NA,the Barwon River in his electorate or to,84
NA,transfer the Deakin wool stores building over,84
NA,the other side of the Barwon River so we,84
NA,could even up the score as far as the Building,84
NA,Better Cities program and the funding in,84
NA,particular electorates were concerned.,84
NA,The Building Better Cities program has,84
NA,been of great benefit to the workers of Gee-,84
NA,long and to the Geelong economy. I am,84
NA,disappointed by the criticisms of the program,84
NA,that have been levelled by the honourable,84
NA,member for Corangamite. He needs to take,84
NA,himself down to those building sites and talk,84
NA,to the building workers whose families have,84
NA,benefited from the employment that the,84
NA,breadwinner has had on those sites and to the,84
NA,people of Geelong about the great benefits,84
NA,that have flowed from this catalytic develop-,84
NA,ment on the foreshore. In excess of $250,84
NA,"million, if we can get the foreshore projects",84
NA,"up and running, will have flowed from a",84
NA,strategic Commonwealth investment in this,84
NA,area.,84
NA,As a result of the Geelong delegation to,84
NA,which I referred who were recently here in,84
NA,Canberra and who lobbied the federal govern-,84
NA,ment for several projects for funding under,84
NA,"the Building Better Cities mark 2 program,",84
NA,several projects have been tabled with the,84
NA,government. I hope that ministers give them,84
NA,serious consideration. We have tabled projects,84
NA,for funding: a geographical information,84
NA,"system, the refurbishment of the Eastern",84
NA,"Gardens, the Boulevard restoration project,",84
NA,to the Whittington link project and the Corio,84
NA,Bay foreshore management project. All those,84
NA,are worth while and can stand on their own,84
NA,two feet as far as evaluation is concerned,84
NA,under the programs that are already in place.,84
NA,The base studies have already been done.,84
NA,These are not projects for funding that the,84
NA,city of greater Geelong or the community has,84
NA,"dreamed up. They are concrete and real, based",84
NA,on some excellent studies that have been done,84
NA,on this area in Geelong.,84
NA,I wholeheartedly support the Building,84
NA,Better Cities 2 program and the funding that,84
NA,has been made available for economic gate-,84
NA,ways and the refurbishment and regeneration,84
NA,of urban areas in major cities. It is a program,84
NA,that has delivered real and lasting benefits to,84
NA,local communities. It has acted as a stimulus,85
NA,for a far greater amount of public and private,85
NA,infrastructure investment in particular areas.,85
NA,It has been a strong generator of employment,85
NA,and a program of great community benefit. I,85
NA,commend the program to the House.,85
Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE ,Dawson) (5.55,85
NA,p.m.)-I rise on these appropriation bills to,85
NA,"cover a few matters. As I do so, I am aware",85
NA,of the fact that these are probably the last,85
NA,appropriation bills I will be speaking on. Back,85
NA,in 1976 I made my maiden speech when I,85
NA,seconded the address-in-reply on the appropri-,85
NA,ation bills. I commented then on the parlia-,85
NA,mentary behaviour in the House in 1975,85
NA,during the events leading up to 11 November,85
NA,and said that the Australian people were,85
NA,absolutely sick and tired of the manner in,85
NA,which their elected representatives confronted,85
NA,issues and did not really apply themselves to,85
NA,the governing of the nation.,85
NA,I can only say that my 20 years in this,85
NA,parliament have been singularly ineffective as,85
NA,far as modifying that behaviour is concerned.,85
NA,I go back to that time and look at the respect,85
NA,in which parliamentarians were then held.,85
NA,People recognised that the office of a politi-,85
NA,cian had something special about it. They,85
NA,"believed politicians. Promises were made, and",85
NA,they were kept.,85
NA,"Now, in 1995, what has been lost is not",85
NA,only that respect but also the truth. I often,85
NA,think that the notice of motion that the mem-,85
NA,ber for Parkes ( Mr Cobb) put forward about,85
NA,truth in political advertising comes to the real,85
NA,nub of the difference between then and now.,85
NA,In spite of a whole raft of legislation that we,85
NA,have enacted to make elections fairer and,85
NA,"politicians more accountable, it has been",85
NA,necessary to put forward that notice of mo-,85
NA,tion. The remarkable thing is that nothing has,85
NA,"been done as a result of it. In other words,",85
NA,there is a lesser standard for a politician in,85
NA,relation to truth in marketing a product than,85
NA,there is for companies and enterprises outside.,85
NA,It is a travesty of justice that has culminated,85
NA,in the most recent suggestion by the Minister,85
NA,for Human Services and Health (Dr Law-,85
NA,"rence) that all politicians lie, so why is she",85
NA,being attacked just because she has been,85
NA,found out? Her defence in connection with,85
NA,the Western Australian case is a reflection on,85
NA,the whole lot of us and really pulls every,85
NA,politician in this country down to her level.,85
NA,It is a great pity that this is so 20 years,85
NA,"down the track, even though we have seen",85
NA,freedom of information being used so the,85
NA,public and the media can see what we are,85
NA,doing and why we are being paid. We have,85
NA,"a register of interests, particularly in the",85
NA,House of Representatives. We have had new,85
NA,electoral acts that are meant to free up the,85
NA,system. We also have more exposure to the,85
NA,media so that politicians' private lives are part,85
NA,and parcel of the daily fight in this place. I,85
NA,am not saying that their private lives should,85
NA,"not be exposed, but I am saying that one",85
NA,person being exposed on one item makes the,85
NA,weight of public opinion collapse on all,85
NA,politicians.,85
NA,As a politician representing an area of some,85
NA,"60,000 square kilometres, I think that one",85
NA,"vote, one value deprives a voter, a constituent,",85
NA,in country and huge electorates such as,85
NA,"Kalgoorlie, Grey, Dawson or Kennedy.",85
NA,Politicians are not the ones being denied,85
NA,because their time and services are available,85
NA,to the extent they can give them in 24 hours.,85
NA,"But constituents well out of the mainstream,",85
NA,"not in a major community or town, have to",85
NA,use a telephone to communicate. That means,85
NA,"time and cost, as does sending a letter, which",85
NA,also means delays. They have to wait until,85
NA,they can come face to face with their politi-,85
NA,cian or they have to travel to communicate,85
NA,with a Commonwealth department centred in,85
NA,"Townsville, Brisbane or Sydney. There is",85
NA,open access to constituents who live in those,85
NA,areas but outback people are denied justice.,85
NA,"One vote, one value is a false philosophy.",85
NA,It does not matter how much is given to,85
NA,"members by way of additional resources, they",85
NA,cannot cope as well as those in the cities. In,85
NA,"comparison with my 60,000 square kilo-",85
NA,"metres, an electorate in Brisbane or Sydney",85
NA,could be as small as 100a distance you could,85
NA,spit across and one you would never be out,85
NA,of over 12 months while representing people.,85
NA,I have been singularly unsuccessful in,85
NA,having parliamentary behaviour improved in,85
NA,"this House. In fact, we are going into an era",86
NA,where people do not trust their politicians;,86
NA,"they do not expect them to tell the truth; and,",86
NA,"as a result, there is a huge disenchantment out",86
NA,there such that only a compulsory vote at an,86
NA,election can bring them to the barriers to cast,86
NA,a vote.,86
NA,I will also talk about the taxation act. As a,86
NA,practising accountant at the time I came to,86
NA,"this place, I was devastated to realise that the",86
NA,tax act was contained in two volumes and was,86
NA,quite thick. I believe that you need simplicity,86
NA,in taxation if you are going to expect the,86
NA,"constituents, the taxpayers, to pay their fair",86
NA,amount. We have seen in this House that at,86
NA,the last budget that tax act grew to four or,86
NA,five times the size it had been. It is no clear-,86
NA,er; it is quite complex and it defies the efforts,86
NA,of a general practitioner in tax law to define,86
NA,every aspect of it.,86
NA,The government has failed to recognise that,86
NA,it does not matter how simple a law might be,86
NA,if it is made to appear complex. I will just,86
NA,talk about the fringe benefits tax act. We have,86
NA,copied New Zealand in this respect. Their,86
NA,legislation is one-third the size of ours. The,86
NA,simple reason is that the fringe benefits tax,86
NA,that applies in Australia is not exactly a fringe,86
NA,benefits tax; it is being used to tax other,86
NA,"items along the way, at the businessman's",86
NA,expense.,86
NA,I often wonder how business people operate,86
NA,"today, with a supposed knowledge of not only",86
NA,tax law but all the other complications and,86
NA,"regulations imposed by state, local and federal",86
NA,governments. How can they find their way in,86
NA,this mire? My heart really goes out to those,86
NA,people who are trying to make a living. They,86
NA,are not succeeding in doing so because of the,86
NA,complexity of the tax act and all the other,86
NA,regulations we find in front of us. I was,86
NA,interested to read in the letters to the editor,86
NA,"the Australian this morning that, when every-",86
NA,body is talking about equal pay for equal,86
NA,"work, a small business person who starts at",86
NA,fi ve in the morning and ends at 11 at night,86
NA,wants to know when they are going to be paid,86
NA,"a fair amount for equal work, as applies with",86
NA,the unions.,86
NA,The myth about Weipa is that the argument,86
NA,is not about equal pay for equal work be-,86
NA,"cause, as I understand it, those people on",86
NA,contracts are multiskilled-they work in,86
NA,various jobs-and they work extra time. Their,86
NA,reward is the bonus arrangements they have,86
NA,"made. As I understand it, people on the award",86
NA,do not work the same hours or under the,86
NA,same conditions. There is a need to free up,86
NA,not only the tax aci but also the industrial,86
NA,relations system.,86
NA,One final comment in connection with,86
NA,"taxation is that I do have a notice of motion,",86
NA,"No. 11, on the Notice Paper at the moment.",86
NA,It is very important. It refers to tax deducti-,86
NA,bility of legal expenses. I have found a,86
NA,problem within my constituency and within,86
NA,"the Australian public as a whole that banks,",86
NA,large insurance institutions and insurance,86
NA,"companies, knowing that they can get tax",86
NA,"deductibility for their litigation expenses, use",86
NA,that advantage mercilessly on a litigant who,86
NA,has not the same fund of money and who,86
NA,cannot claim expenses as a tax deduction. As,86
NA,"a result, there is an unequal battle in the",86
NA,courts. You can almost buy your form of,86
NA,justice by the amount of tax deductibility you,86
NA,can derive from it.,86
NA,I believe there should be a correction in,86
NA,those cases where there is an abuse of the,86
NA,system and where ordinary taxpayers are,86
NA,paying for the privilege of large financial,86
NA,institutions being able to blast taxpayers out,86
NA,"of the courts, sometimes driving them into",86
NA,bankruptcy. I believe something should be,86
NA,done about it.,86
NA,Another interest of mine affects every,86
NA,representative in this parliament at some time,86
NA,"or another during a year. Every so often, a",86
NA,"major contractor will go broke and, at the",86
NA,"same time, leave a raft of subcontractors,",86
NA,builders suppliers and employers of workers,86
NA,unable to collect on that debt. It has no,86
NA,"in preference under the Bankruptcy Act. In fact,",86
NA,it gets worse than that. If a subcontractor or,86
NA,material supplier for a major contractor gets,86
NA,a payment within six months of the bankrupt-,86
NA,"cy, they are forced to class that as a preferred",86
NA,payment and pay it back.,86
NA,"In the last 12 months, this has happened in",86
NA,Mackay on two occasions. One was an entire-,86
NA,"ly private arrangement, where the subcontrac-",86
NA,tors missed out. A comparison of the employ-,86
NA,ment record of small business and big busi-,87
NA,ness shows that the fallout is tremendous as,87
NA,far as unemployment is concerned. It brought,87
NA,to my mind once again the problems that,87
NA,exist. If the building industry drops dramati-,87
NA,"cally after a period of prosperity or a boom,",87
NA,within two or three months you can expect to,87
NA,see a whole category of bankruptcies and,87
NA,liquidations where only the local people,87
NA,suffer.,87
NA,I think the other example is more important.,87
NA,"A person was contracting for Q-Build, which",87
NA,is a state department. The client was a state,87
NA,department with money in hand. Obviously,87
NA,they did not have protection and they did not,87
NA,care to exercise it. When they paid the con-,87
NA,"tractor, the subbies should also have been",87
NA,"paid. As a result, once the contract was",87
NA,"finished, the contractor had liabilities of",87
NA,"$327,000, for which he had assets of about",87
NA,"$20,000. As a result, all those subcontractors",87
NA,and suppliers of material and services also,87
NA,had to go to the wall. Despite this happening,87
NA,"recently, I remember three years ago writing",87
NA,to the same minister in connection with the,87
NA,same department asking what protections he,87
NA,had put in place. He gave me a whole raft of,87
NA,"assurances, but nothing came of it to the",87
NA,extent that it is still happening.,87
NA,The good news in this regard is that this,87
NA,year the Joint Committee on Public Works,87
NA,undertook to have every contract involving,87
NA,any Commonwealth department as a client,87
NA,state that subcontractors be paid a progress,87
NA,"payment and that, unless there is evidence to",87
NA,"that effect, no payment be made to the con-",87
NA,tractor. I am happy to say that I was given an,87
NA,assurance that that happens not only with,87
NA,contracts of $6 million or more that the Joint,87
NA,Public Works Committee examines but also,87
NA,with every other contract that the Common-,87
NA,"wealth enters into. If that is the record, pay-",87
NA,"ments may be slow. If payments are made,",87
NA,that is great. But that has not been happening,87
NA,with the states.,87
NA,We undertook as a Public Works Commit-,87
NA,tee to talk to the state public works commit-,87
NA,tees about this matter. It would probably be,87
NA,of no surprise to the members here to realise,87
NA,"that even the client, being the state, in a",87
NA,preferred position did not insist on those,87
NA,subcontractual arrangements. We also found,87
NA,that only one state has legislation of any type,87
NA,"that gives some protection, and that is",87
NA,"Queensland. It was found that, in its own",87
NA,"way, that legislation could be manoeuvred",87
NA,around and made ineffectual.,87
NA,Following our visits to the state public,87
NA,"works committees, I undertook as a matter of",87
NA,urgency-there is a notice of motion on the,87
NA,Notice Paper at this stage-to see whether the,87
NA,Commonwealth could do more. I have sought,87
NA,in this legislation to try to get a preference for,87
NA,payments to subcontractors in the case of a,87
NA,liquidation or bankruptcy.,87
NA,I am also heartened by the response of one,87
NA,organisation in Australia that seems to have,87
NA,its feet on the ground as far as this is con-,87
NA,"cerned. Bisco, which is in New South Wales,",87
NA,has set out to supply a formula that not only,87
NA,secures payments to the contractor and even-,87
NA,"tually the subcontractor but also, before the",87
NA,"contract is put into place, provides security",87
NA,"for payment which involves the client, the",87
NA,financier and the builder. There is an insis-,87
NA,tence that that money is in place so that a,87
NA,bankruptcy will not occur because of a lack,87
NA,of funds. It also insists that the subcontractors,87
NA,are looked at in detail so that they can be,87
NA,paid from the funds out of progress payments.,87
NA,These people go further than just look at,87
NA,the normal argument of a subcontractor,87
NA,beefing against a contractor or a construction,87
NA,person. They have looked at security for,87
NA,"payment across the board. The architect, the",87
NA,"supplier of material, the subcontractor and the",87
NA,service provider all get a say. The security of,87
NA,payment which flows from that says that the,87
NA,"contractor must, on payment, pay the subcon-",87
NA,tractors.,87
NA,"Dispute resolution is very much a part of it,",87
NA,because at this stage dispute resolution is an,87
NA,absolute myth. It can go on for years and,87
NA,years. A particular report in New South Wales,87
NA,proved the fact that building costs in Australia,87
NA,are at least two per cent more than they,87
NA,"should be because of the bad debt factor, and",87
NA,almost another one per cent more because of,87
NA,slow payment by contractors to the subbies.,87
NA,"If it can be put in place, this would be a",87
NA,marvellous way of doing something for small,87
NA,business in Australia. Nothing exemplifies,87
NA,more the small business character in Australia,88
NA,than all those service subbies and contractors,88
NA,across Australia.,88
NA,It came to my attention recently that an,88
NA,organisation in Queensland is almost hiding,88
NA,itself behind the name of a Commonwealth or,88
NA,state department. It is writing to subcontrac-,88
NA,tors and contractors to say that if they register,88
NA,their name with the organisation for a fee of,88
NA,$175 it will place them on a preferment list,88
NA,for state and Commonwealth contracts. You,88
NA,would think it was a state or Commonwealth,88
NA,department imposing yet another fee. It is a,88
NA,private organisation rendering an account for,88
NA,$175 by saying that registration is obligatory.,88
NA,There is no obligation. I believe that we,88
NA,should see it for what it is. It is a rort. I have,88
NA,written to the Attorney-General in Queensland,88
NA,in that regard.,88
NA,I will mention quickly the republic debate.,88
NA,Those who with anti-British prejudice argue,88
NA,the case for a republic are doing the cause no,88
NA,good. Until we clear the decks of the old,88
NA,myths-that we do not want to be under the,88
NA,"control of Britain any longer, that Britain has",88
NA,exploited us and the whole raft of argu-,88
NA,ments-we will not have a rational debate in,88
NA,this country.,88
NA,I was sitting beside someone on an aircraft,88
NA,this week. While I was not persuaded to his,88
NA,"view, he said that until we get this Irish, anti-",88
NA,British bigotry out of the argument we will,88
NA,not go anywhere with this debate. Those,88
NA,people who argue against the divorcement of,88
NA,Australia from Britain must realise that,88
NA,divorcement has taken place over a number of,88
NA,years. It is now complete. If anybody now has,88
NA,an argument about British involvement in,88
NA,"their affairs, it is the European Union. There",88
NA,has been a complete transfer in Britain's,88
NA,preferences and influence from the Common-,88
NA,wealth to the European Community. People,88
NA,who argue that should then respond by giving,88
NA,me an argument why we should transfer our,88
NA,allegiances-if that is what they are-from,88
NA,Britain to the United Nations.,88
NA,I know that over the last four or five weeks,88
NA,we have had in this House a debate about,88
NA,how the United Nations is now controlling the,88
NA,future of Australia and the manner in which,88
NA,we do things. It was necessary for the govern-,88
NA,ment to bring in legislation to protect itself,88
NA,against a treaty of the United Nations about,88
NA,the protection of the child. The government,88
NA,had to react against a UN treaty in order to,88
NA,implement its own sovereignty. It is happen-,88
NA,ing in many other ways. If we have a problem,88
NA,"in this country, irrespective of whether we are",88
NA,"a republic or a monarchy, how we deal with",88
NA,that problem depends on the manner in which,88
NA,we are beholden as a sovereign country to the,88
NA,United Nations. It is only in the last 12,88
NA,months that the Republicans in the US have,88
NA,said that they want to claw back that sover-,88
NA,eignty and will do whatever they can to,88
NA,achieve that.,88
NA,Another aspect that interests me as far as,88
NA,changing the constitution is concerned is the,88
NA,manner in which the Republicans are looking,88
NA,for a balanced budget. They have already,88
NA,brought the President back from 10 years to,88
NA,"seven years. I believe that, if there is going to",88
NA,"be a change in the Australian constitution, it",88
NA,should be in that direction. (Time expired),88
Mr LINDSAY ,Herbert-Parliamentary,88
NA,"Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science",88
NA,and Technology) (6.15 p.m.)-This is an,88
NA,excellent opportunity for members to talk on,88
NA,issues affecting their own electorates. In my,88
NA,"case, I also wish to talk about recent develop-",88
NA,"ments in the portfolio of industry, science and",88
NA,technology. The past 13 years have seen,88
NA,significant reform and development in the,88
NA,Australian economy. The Prime Minister ( Mr,88
NA,Keating) and the federal government have,88
NA,provided the leadership to tackle the impedi-,88
NA,ments to reform and development. The,88
NA,government has also tackled the issues that,88
NA,the opposition found too hard.,88
NA,In government the opposition avoided tariff,88
NA,reform. As a result the manufacturing industry,88
NA,"was inward looking, uncompetitive and bereft",88
NA,"of investment. Under this government, manu-",88
NA,facturing exports have been driving economic,88
NA,growth. I repeat: in government the opposition,88
NA,avoided tax reform. As a result the biggest,88
NA,growth industry was tax avoidance while tax,88
NA,levels for PAYE taxpayers and company tax,88
NA,were inequitably high. Under this government,88
NA,the rorts were stopped and the tax rates,88
NA,lowered.,88
NA,In government the opposition feared en-,89
NA,gagement with Asia and sought comfort and,89
NA,help from a distant and disinterested mon-,89
NA,archy. This government has provided the,89
NA,"leadership to create APEC. More than this, it",89
NA,has provided the integrity to make APEC a,89
NA,"driving force for world economic reform,",89
NA,much to the benefit of Australia. The Leader,89
NA,"of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong,",89
NA,( Mr Howard) would undermine the achieve-,89
NA,ments and potential of APEC. His refusal to,89
NA,see a senior Vietnamese delegation typifies,89
NA,his approach. He is simply not capable of,89
NA,providing leadership for APEC. The Leader,89
NA,of the Opposition could not understand and,89
NA,would fear an organisation with the flexibility,89
NA,"to contain the People's Republic of China,",89
NA,Taiwan and Hong Kong.,89
NA,The historic agreement reached by leaders,89
NA,of APEC at Bogor has been enhanced by the,89
NA,recent meeting in Osaka and commended by,89
NA,Vice President Al Gore. The importance of,89
NA,this agreement to Australia cannot be overesti-,89
NA,"mated. Without the achievements of APEC,",89
NA,Australian firms would have been isolated,89
NA,from huge growth and Asian markets. The,89
NA,estimates of this growth are staggering. For,89
NA,"example, the Asian food market is estimated",89
NA,in the MCKinsey report on Asian food markets,89
NA,to grow to over $900 billion by the year,89
NA,2000. A recent report from the Bureau of,89
NA,Transport and Communications Economics,89
NA,estimated at $230 billion the accumulated,89
NA,Asian export market over the next 15 years.,89
NA,The Asian Development Bank estimates that,89
NA,over the decade of the 1990s around $US50,89
NA,billion will be invested in new power projects,89
NA,by Asia-Pacific nations.,89
NA,The APEC agreements provide significant,89
NA,opportunities for Australian industry. But,89
NA,industry will also face the major challenge of,89
NA,having to compete in a free market environ-,89
NA,ment in both regional and domestic markets.,89
NA,Australian industry needs to be at world's best,89
NA,practice in virtually every respect within 15,89
NA,years in order to cope and to thrive under,89
NA,these circumstances.,89
NA,"The government has directed the industry,",89
NA,"science and technology portfolio, particularly",89
NA,"the department, to take a major",89
NA,ing this objective. Government industry policy,89
NA,is not directed at intervention or protection,89
NA,industry; government policy is directed at,89
NA,fostering innovation which leads to the cre-,89
NA,ation of a competitive environment and,89
NA,competitive firms. Science and technology,89
NA,make a vital contribution to innovation. The,89
NA,government's annual support for R&D,89
NA,through the portfolio has reached record,89
NA,levels and now stands at over $1.2 billion.,89
NA,At a meeting of OECD science ministers in,89
NA,"September, the significance of the govern-",89
NA,ment's commitment to R&D stood out.,89
NA,Australia is one of the few OECD nations,89
NA,where expenditure on R&D is significantly,89
NA,increasing. Australia stands in the top rank of,89
NA,OECD nations for expenditure by government,89
NA,"on R&D. In our traditional area of weakness,",89
NA,"expenditure by business on R&D, Australia is",89
NA,making very rapid progress.,89
NA,Honourable members are well aware of the,89
NA,extensive consultations on innovation by the,89
NA,"Minister for Industry, Science and Technology",89
NA,(Senator Cook). Both industry and the re-,89
NA,search community have responded to the,89
NA,challenge. The innovation statement to be,89
NA,released by the government will further,89
NA,enhance Australia's capacity for innovation.,89
NA,The opposition has no policies on innova-,89
NA,"tion, or for that matter on any other area of",89
NA,industry policy. I brought this situation to the,89
NA,attention of my good friend the honourable,89
NA,member for Ryan ( Mr Moore) in the debate,89
NA,on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) in May this,89
NA,year. It saddens me that the member for Ryan,89
NA,"has, for whatever reason, been unable to",89
NA,provide any evidence of his thinking in this,89
NA,most important area of public policy. His,89
NA,"predecessors as industry, science and technol-",89
NA,ogy spokespeople for the opposition showed,89
NA,a readiness to defend vested interests and a,89
NA,narrowness of outlook quite incompatible with,89
NA,innovation.,89
NA,"I caution the honourable member for Ryan,",89
NA,my good friend: last-minute electioneering is,89
NA,not a substitute for considered policy making.,89
NA,"Industry, science and technology policy is the",89
NA,engine of economic growth. The Australian,89
NA,people will not accept a party that considers,89
NA,industry policy to be about handouts and,89
NA,role in achiev- political donations.,89
NA,"In this regard, I was deeply concerned by",89
NA,of the debate on the matter of public importance,89
NA,brought on by the member for Pearce ( Mrs,90
NA,Moylan) last week. She confirmed my state-,90
NA,ment in May this year that popularism and,90
NA,prejudice are the Liberal Party's guiding,90
NA,principles. She appeals to popularism as her,90
NA,excuse and justification for having no policies,90
NA,in such significant areas of small business,90
NA,policy as 'unconscionable conduct'. The Aust-,90
NA,ralian people have every right to be suspi-,90
NA,cious of a party that considers popularism as,90
NA,a substitute for policy.,90
NA,What are the opposition's policies for small,90
NA,business? All we can go on is its track record.,90
NA,When the Leader of the Opposition was,90
NA,"Treasurer, paying tax for the wealthy became",90
NA,an optional extra. Is the opposition promising,90
NA,a repeat of its 1980s policies of greed? That,90
NA,is its nature. I caution small business to be,90
NA,suspicious of false promises. They are no,90
NA,substitute for the sound policies of the,90
NA,government that have created excellent oppor-,90
NA,tunities for small business.,90
NA,One of the major initiatives of the federal,90
NA,government to assist small and medium sized,90
NA,business has been the creation of Auslndustry.,90
NA,The effective implementation of Auslndustry,90
NA,is a major priority for the federal Department,90
NA,"of Industry, Science and Technology. Au slnd-",90
NA,ustry is servicing the needs of firms by,90
NA,providing ready access to the full range of,90
NA,federal and state government programs. A,90
NA,private sector led board of Auslndustry guides,90
NA,"these efforts. In particular, Auslndustry is",90
NA,providing national leadership that has provid-,90
NA,ed cohesion and quality for a plethora of state,90
NA,government programs. The opposition has,90
NA,said that enterprise improvement programs,90
NA,such as those administered through,90
NA,Auslndustry would be better handled by the,90
NA,states.,90
NA,"In the era of APEC and global business, the",90
NA,states do not have the critical mass to develop,90
NA,and provide world standard business improve-,90
NA,ment programs. Anything less than world,90
NA,quality is a waste of industry's time.,90
NA,Auslndustry is one of the most successful,90
NA,partnerships between the federal and state,90
NA,governments and the private sector. I call on,90
NA,the member for Ryan to provide bipartisan,90
NA,support for federal leadership in this critical,90
NA,area. Auslndustry has assisted more than,90
NA,"5,000 firms this year-4,230 firms have",90
NA,phoned the Auslndustry national hotline since,90
NA,"its launch in June, 2,800 firms have received",90
NA,advice and assistance through Auslndustry's,90
NA,enterprise improvement programs this year,90
NA,"and 2,200 firms have received R&D grants",90
NA,for tax concessions this year.,90
NA,Access to government programs has also,90
NA,"been facilitated by Bizhelp, which provides",90
NA,comprehensive national information on enter-,90
NA,prise improvement programs provided by,90
NA,"federal, state and territory governments. In",90
NA,"particular, it is doing very well in the ACT",90
NA,government. Bizhelp has been widely distri-,90
NA,buted not only within government but also to,90
NA,"business agents such as banks, lawyers and",90
NA,"accountants. More than 1,600 government and",90
NA,private sector organisations currently sub-,90
NA,scribe to Bizhelp.,90
NA,The business networks program is another,90
NA,major new initiative of Auslndustry. It has,90
NA,been adopted from a very successful program,90
NA,run in Denmark. Its aim is to help small and,90
NA,medium sized firms to work together in order,90
NA,to be internationally competitive. There are a,90
NA,number of examples around the country.,90
NA,The industry innovation program is the,90
NA,most important program of Auslndustry. I,90
NA,would like to describe for honourable mem-,90
NA,bers just how this program is transforming,90
NA,Australia. For years agricultural production in,90
NA,the Ord irrigation area has lacked economic,90
NA,scale of production. The industry innovation,90
NA,program enabled an innovative high intensity,90
NA,mini-sugar mill to be designed and built at,90
NA,Kununurra. This mill has enabled an econom-,90
NA,ic sugar industry to be established at the Ord.,90
NA,Members who take an interest in the sugar,90
NA,industry will know that the first crushing is,90
NA,under way. I can see that the member for,90
NA,Dawson ( Mr Braithwaite) is in the chamber.,90
NA,I recall that when he was shadow minister for,90
NA,primary industries he was very keen to see a,90
NA,"sugar industry established in the Ord, so I",90
NA,expect his rapt attention as I relate the success,90
NA,of this new federal government initiative.,90
NA,Plans are now in place to expand the area,90
NA,under irrigation tenfold and to realise the,90
NA,dreams of the pioneers of north-western,90
NA,Australia. I see that the Parliamentary Secre-,90
NA,"tary to the Minister for the Environment,",90
NA,"Sport and Territories, the member for the",91
NA,"Northern Territory ( Mr Snowdon), is also in",91
NA,the chamber. The new sugar mill and the new,91
NA,expansion of the Ord irrigation scheme will,91
NA,go into the Northern Territory and create a,91
NA,new sugar industry in that very important part,91
NA,of Australia. The value of agricultural produccompetitiveness,91
NA,tion will increase from about $30 million per,91
NA,annum prior to sugar becoming established at,91
NA,the Ord to over $200 million per annum once,91
NA,the full potential of sugar is realised.,91
NA,The industry innovation program works,91
NA,because it harnesses the innovative potential,91
NA,of Australian industry. The Ord mini-mill was,91
NA,the creation of the bright young Brisbane,91
NA,"based engineering group Schultz, Tait, Grieg",91
NA,and Associates combined with the project,91
NA,management skills of CSR and the Ord,91
NA,"District Cooperative, an outstanding partner-",91
NA,ship.,91
NA,The 150 per cent tax concession area of the,91
NA,industry innovation program is supporting,91
NA,research across a wide range of industry in,91
NA,"Australia. For example, BHP's Project M has",91
NA,been described by the company as the biggest,91
NA,single R&D project in the world steel indus-,91
NA,try. This new sheet steel process is designed,91
NA,to provide BHP with the technological edge,91
NA,to conquer rapidly developing Asian markets.,91
NA,"More research in BHP, CRA and elsewhere",91
NA,is being technology supported to promote,91
NA,"new, high intensity iron smelting. This could",91
NA,transform world steel making and make,91
NA,Australia a world leader in iron and steel,91
NA,production and technology.,91
NA,It is not only in the resources area that,91
NA,"Australian companies are backing researcl""-",91
NA,and development. Four out of the nine Aus-,91
NA,tralian companies spending more than $50,91
NA,million a year on R&D are in the telecom-,91
NA,munications sector. Australia's deregulated,91
NA,and dynamic telecommunications market has,91
NA,established Australia as a world centre for,91
NA,telecommunications research. (Quorum,91
NA,formed) The call of the member for Moore for,91
NA,a quorum was the longest speech he has made,91
NA,in this chamber in 1995.,91
NA,Let me continue with my important re-,91
NA,marks. Last financial year the combined R&D,91
NA,expenditure of the top four telecommunica-,91
NA,tions companies was $429 million. The,91
NA,"companies included Telstra, Ericsson, Alcatel",91
NA,and Optus. Telecommunications is not only,91
NA,Australia's fastest growing industry but the,91
NA,fastest growing industry in the world.,91
NA,The Australian government is determined to,91
NA,ensure that Australia's advantages and global,91
NA,are recognised by internation-,91
NA,"al companies. To this end, we are embarking",91
NA,on new campaigns focusing on Australia as a,91
NA,regional centre for service support and R&D.,91
NA,The government is succeeding in establishing,91
NA,new regional headquarters and research,91
NA,centres in Australia through a combination of,91
NA,measures designed to facilitate international,91
NA,companies to establish in Australia. The,91
NA,program provides no benefits not available to,91
NA,Australian firms.,91
NA,Two weeks ago I had the privilege of,91
NA,launching the Australian office of TMI-Tele,91
NA,Media International. TMI is a wholly owned,91
NA,subsidiary of Telecom-Italia and is one of the,91
NA,world's top 10 telecommunications com-,91
NA,panies-I think it is No.6. It has been attract-,91
NA,ed to invest in Australia by the rapid growth,91
NA,in Australia's telecommunications market and,91
NA,by Australia's strong telecommunications skill,91
NA,base. This company will bring new skills to,91
NA,the Australian telecommunications industry,91
NA,and the ability to access new markets.,91
NA,Under the policies of the federal govern-,91
NA,"ment, Australia has become a centre for R&D",91
NA,for many of the world's major companies. For,91
NA,"example, BTR Nylex, ICI, Alcoa, Effem",91
NA,"Foods, 3M, Kodak, Merck Sharp and Dohme",91
NA,and Hoechst all have major R&D expendi-,91
NA,tures in Australia.,91
NA,This contrasts with the record under the,91
NA,member for Bennelong as Treasurer. When,91
NA,"the member for Bennelong was Treasurer, the",91
NA,environment for industrial research in Austral-,91
NA,ia was so hostile that industrial laboratories,91
NA,closed and expenditure by industry on R&D,91
NA,virtually collapsed.,91
NA,Has the opposition now learned the value,91
NA,the Australian people place on industrial,91
NA,research and its importance in promoting,91
NA,economic growth? Has it learned how import-,91
NA,ant pure science is to the Australian econ-,91
NA,omy? Not if you read the media releases of,91
NA,"the honourable member for Ryan, who also",91
NA,claims to be the shadow minister for industry,91
NA,and commerce. In a release dated 4 October,92
NA,"1995, the member for Ryan misrepresents the",92
NA,government's regional headquarters and R&D,92
NA,centres program. He refers to the program as,92
NA,'a government plan to disadvantage Australian,92
NA,industry'. This is not the only misrep-,92
NA,"resentation of the matters, but it is quite",92
NA,shameful. In the body of the text the member,92
NA,for Ryan mischievously suggests that the,92
NA,Australian taxpayers are subsidising foreign,92
NA,multinationals and that the program puts,92
NA,Australian firms at a disadvantage compared,92
NA,with foreign firms.,92
NA,This is back to the future of the member for,92
NA,Bennelong's 1954 attitudes towards policy on,92
NA,industry research and development. I suspect,92
NA,that the member for Ryan knows that these,92
NA,claims are false and that he is prepared to,92
NA,distort sound industry policy for his own base,92
NA,political purposes. These remarks demonstrate,92
NA,a latent hostility to foreign investment by the,92
NA,coalition. (Time expired),92
Mr ABBOTT ,Warringah) (6.35 p.m.)-,92
NA,One can take some of the points referred to,92
NA,"by the previous speaker, the member for",92
NA,"Herbert ( Mr Lindsay), but the fact is that he",92
NA,needs to understand that it is companies and,92
NA,"individuals which innovate, not governments.",92
NA,When governments try to get into the busi-,92
NA,"ness of innovation themselves, when they try",92
NA,"to get into the business of picking winners,",92
NA,they find themselves in the difficulties I am,92
NA,about to describe.,92
NA,I am sure that much of the work of,92
NA,"Auslndustry is fine, splendid and commend-",92
NA,able work. I am sure that nearly all of those,92
NA,"5,000 companies Auslndustry helped deserved",92
NA,"the help, but the fact is that Auslndustry",92
NA,"through a careful, rigorous process, unlike",92
NA,"process I am about to describe, which was",92
NA,simply cooked up between one businessman,92
NA,and the Prime Minister ( Mr Keating) up there,92
NA,at the businessman's house in Red Hill.,92
NA,There are three problems with the show-,92
NA,ground deal negotiated between the Prime,92
NA,"Minister and Rupert Murdoch. First, it is an",92
NA,attempt to pick winners in an industry which,92
NA,"is commercial quicksand. Second, it is a $32",92
NA,"million gift to one of the world's richest, if",92
NA,"even one of the more deserving, men. Third,",92
NA,"on the face of it at least, it appears to be a",92
NA,violation of most of the rules of due process.,92
NA,Perhaps there is a case to be made for this,92
NA,"deal, but if there is it should be made by the",92
NA,government and this deal should not be snuck,92
NA,"through, as it were, buried in a vast appropri-",92
NA,ation bill.,92
NA,This government likes to boast about its,92
NA,"commitment to the free market, about its pro-",92
NA,business attitude. There is much to commend,92
NA,"in all that, but the fact is that this government",92
NA,"has reduced tariffs on manufacturing industry,",92
NA,"damaging the battlers, the small businesses",92
NA,and the workshops involved. It ha& reduced,92
NA,"subsidies for agriculture, damaging and",92
NA,hurting many of Australia's small farmers. It,92
NA,"has practised a form of wage restraint, inflict-",92
NA,ing on some of Australia's poorest paid,92
NA,workers lower real wages today than they had,92
NA,in 1976. It has done all of this.,92
NA,It has shunned the search to pick winners,92
NA,when picking winners might have benefited,92
NA,"the worst off in our society, yet it is strangely",92
NA,anxious to pick winners when we are talking,92
NA,about a business controlled by one of the,92
NA,"world's richest men. In normal commerce,",92
NA,this government protests its desire to avoid,92
NA,"the old ways of doing things, yet in one",92
NA,"industry, the media, this government practises",92
NA,the art of intervention at every possible,92
NA,opportuni ty .,92
NA,These movie studios that under the govern-,92
NA,ment's plan are going to be established at the,92
NA,showground are an addition to an industry,92
NA,"which, in fact, is suffering right around the",92
NA,"world. In the US, many movie studios are in",92
NA,economic trouble. The great Pinewood Stu-,92
NA,dios in England are in fact in a state of semi-,92
NA,went mothballs. Movieworld on the Gold Coast has,92
NA,the just made its first profit after seven years.,92
NA,This is the industry that the government is,92
NA,now supporting a new entrant to-with a $32,92
NA,million handout.,92
NA,We are told that this show ground venture is,92
NA,in fact going to put Australia's movie industry,92
NA,"on the map. When you look behind it, when",92
NA,"you look to the fine print, it turns out that",92
NA,only 20 per cent of the projected revenue,92
NA,from this venture is going to be generated by,92
NA,movie maki .. g. We are told by the govern-,92
NA,ment that this venture is going to provide lots,92
NA,of jobs for Australia's fine young actors and,92
NA,"actresses. Well, maybe it will, but very few of",93
NA,them will be acting in movies and television,93
NA,"productions. Most of them, if they are to get",93
NA,"jobs in this venture, will be selling tickets and",93
NA,drinks because this is essentially a theme,93
NA,"park, not a movie studio.",93
NA,"If we look at theme parks, again we see that",93
NA,they are struggling everywhere. Dreamworld,93
NA,"on the Gold Coast was, I believe, recently in",93
NA,the hands of a receiver. Let us look at,93
NA,Movieworld on the Gold Coast. Not only has,93
NA,"it only just made a profit after seven years,",93
NA,but it required large subsidies from the,93
NA,Queensland government in the form of payroll,93
NA,tax exemptions to get going. Luna Park in,93
NA,Sydney required large subsidies from the state,93
NA,government to get operational and that is now,93
NA,in receivership.,93
NA,In spending what is in effect $32 million of,93
NA,"federal taxpayers' money, this government is",93
NA,venturing into commercial quicksand. There,93
NA,is a whiff of Brian Burke and his petrochem-,93
NA,ical plant about this. There is a whiff of John,93
NA,Cain and the Victorian Economic Develop-,93
NA,ment Corporation and Tricontinental about,93
NA,this. There is a hint of John Bannon and the,93
NA,State Bank of South Australia about this.,93
NA,"Obviously, News Ltd is a splendid com-",93
NA,pany-it is an international success story-but,93
NA,even good companies can make bad invest-,93
NA,ments. The point is that the Australian taxpay-,93
NA,er should not have to subsidise any commer-,93
NA,cial investment.,93
NA,It is interesting. The Prime Minister likes,93
NA,"attack the donkeys and the lemmings, as he",93
NA,"calls them, in the superannuation industry. If",93
NA,"this investment is so stunningly brilliant, if",93
NA,"this is such a sure thing, why is the superan-",93
NA,nuation industry not investing in it? Why do,93
NA,we have to have the federal taxpayer giving,93
NA,this $32 million gift to Fox Studios? Why is,93
NA,this proposal going to survive and prosper?,93
NA,Why is this proposal a goer when the others,93
NA,have been so problematic? On the face of the,93
NA,"evidence the government has provided, it",93
NA,looks as though it is because it is getting a,93
NA,bigger subsidy.,93
NA,"As I said, this is not really a movie studio.",93
NA,This is more a theme park. This is more a,93
NA,venue for showing pictures rather than making,93
NA,them. Did the government subsidise Hoyts to,93
NA,knock down the Trocadero on George Street,93
NA,in Sydney all those years ago? Did the,93
NA,government clean up that site for Hoyts? If it,93
NA,"did not do it for Hoyts, what is the justifica-",93
NA,tion for doing it now for Fox? Why should,93
NA,the government give Fox an advantage it did,93
NA,not give to Hoyts?,93
NA,Let us look at all the other cinemas around,93
NA,"Sydney, all the other cinemas that Fox Stu-",93
NA,dios at the showground is going to be in,93
NA,competition with. Did those small business-,93
NA,"men, or even those big businessmen, get a big",93
NA,subsidy from the government to clean up their,93
NA,site and put up their theatre? Of course they,93
NA,didn't. What about all the battlers who cur-,93
NA,rently have jobs in those picture theatres,93
NA,"selling popcorn, ice-cream and tickets? What",93
NA,about them? Did the government think of,93
NA,them when it handed this $32 million to Fox,93
NA,Studios to put a business at the showground,93
NA,"in direct competition with them, a direct",93
NA,threat to their livelihood? I suspect it did not.,93
NA,I am not in the business of criticising,93
NA,Rupert Murdoch. This is not Rupert Mur-,93
NA,doch's fault. This is the government's fault.,93
NA,Rupert Murdoch is a great Australian. Rupert,93
NA,Murdoch is an Australian who has brought,93
NA,"Australia to the world, as well as someone",93
NA,who now wants to bring the world to Austral-,93
NA,"ia. Rupert Murdoch, indeed, is a former",93
NA,employer of mine.,93
NA,The Australian newspaper is a credit to,93
NA,Rupert Murdoch's patriotism. It is a credit to,93
NA,"to his dream of a national newspaper. Of course,",93
NA,for years the Australian newspaper was kept,93
NA,afloat because of the constant subventions,93
NA,from the rest of the News Ltd empire. Rupert,93
NA,Murdoch did not ask for $32 million to get,93
NA,the Australian going. He did not ask for $7,93
NA,million to clean up the Holt Street site. He,93
NA,"did all this because he realised, first, that",93
NA,News Ltd could make a profit in the market-,93
NA,"place and, second, that the Australian was",93
NA,worth supporting out of his pocket. I wonder,93
NA,why he is not showing the same confidence,93
NA,and the same faith in the Australian film,93
NA,industry as he showed in the Australian print,93
NA,industry all those years ago by supporting it,93
NA,himself.,93
NA,I can understand the Prime Minister's desire,93
NA,to be on the best of possible terms with Mr,93
NA,Murdoch. I think it is only sensible that an,94
NA,Australian Prime Minister would want to talk,94
NA,"to Mr Murdoch, would want to have dinner",94
NA,"with Mr Murdoch, would want to listen to Mr",94
NA,"Murdoch's advice. Do all of those things, but",94
NA,do not give his companies $32 million worth,94
NA,of taxpayers' money. Argue for Mr Mur-,94
NA,"doch's support, reason with Mr Murdoch, but",94
NA,do not try to buy it with $32 million of,94
NA,taxpayers' money.,94
NA,This is part of the Prime Minister's,94
NA,term and ongoing fascination with the media.,94
NA,Back in 1981 when he was the shadow cessful,94
NA,"spokesman, I think, for minerals and energy,",94
NA,the Prime Minister earned a few moments,94
NA,notoriety by standing up at a Labor conferthis,94
NA,ence and saying that what the Labor Party,94
NA,needed was a couple of really vicious ad,94
NA,to give it an advantage in its struggle with,94
NA,"Fraser government. Edna Carew, the Prime",94
NA,"Minister's biographer, has talked",94
NA,"long love-ins with the press gallery, those",94
NA,long gallery crawls of years ago when he,94
NA,"would go through the gallery repeatedly,",94
NA,alternately soft-soaping the journalists and,94
NA,threatening them with all sorts of terrible fates,94
NA,if they did not say the things he liked.,94
NA,"Max Sutch, a celebrated Australian journallet's",94
NA,"ist, published his famous memorandum",94
NA,describing the then Treasurer's meeting with,94
NA,Fairfax executives in which he said that the,94
NA,Prime Minister's conversation was littered,94
NA,"with threats, with references to 'our crowd'",94
NA,and with favours given in return for favours,94
NA,received. The most blatant attempt by the,94
NA,Prime Minister to buy himself favourable,94
NA,media coverage was that other infamous,94
NA,Kirribilli House agreement-that between,94
NA,Conrad Black and the Prime Minister in,94
NA,lead-up to the 1993 election campaign when,94
NA,the Prime Minister said to Conrad Black that,94
NA,he would look at increasing his shareholding,94
NA,in Fairfax in return for what he described,94
NA,"balanced coverage. When asked about it later,",94
NA,"he said, 'I, the Prime Minister, am the judge",94
NA,of what is balanced and being the Prime,94
NA,Minister gives me that right.',94
NA,The fact is that Rupert Murdoch,94
NA,bought. Rupert Murdoch's papers will call it,94
NA,"as they see it, regardless of any deal.",94
NA,fundamental thing to say about this,94
NA,"million gift to Fox Studios is that, from the",94
NA,"Prime Minister's point of view, it is complete-",94
NA,"ly wasted money. In fact, it reflects no credit",94
NA,on the Prime Minister and it reflects no credit,94
NA,on our Australian way of doing business.,94
NA,Dangling subsidies in front of Rupert,94
NA,Murdoch is rather akin to the British Labour,94
NA,government of the 1970s repeatedly dangling,94
NA,subsidies in front of British Leyland. It makes,94
NA,no sense to operate that way. It makes no,94
NA,longsense for the government of a successful,94
NA,company to treat the management of a suc-,94
NA,country in this way. It shows on the,94
NA,part of the government complete contempt for,94
NA,"of the modus operandi of the company. In fact,",94
NA,whole deal suggests that we really do,94
NA,have a touch of the banana republicanism in,94
NA,"men this government, that we are not so much",94
NA,the different from a Third WorId nation trying to,94
NA,buy our way into prestige projects with a bit,94
NA,about those of taxpayer largesse.,94
NA,I entirely support government funding for,94
NA,the arts. The arts are a worthy and a noble,94
NA,"enterprise, one which entirely deserves sup-",94
NA,"port from all sections of society, including",94
NA,from the government. But let's do it directly.,94
NA,"If we want to give $32 million to the arts,",94
NA,give it to them directly. Let's not try to,94
NA,launder the money through Fox Studios.,94
NA,Let's suppose for a few moments that $32,94
NA,million should be spent to promote the film,94
NA,"industry, notwithstanding the fact that there is",94
NA,already a perfectly acceptable movie studio in,94
NA,"Australia at MovieworId, notwithstanding the",94
NA,fact that these businesses have had so much,94
NA,trouble making a profit in recent Australia.,94
NA,"How would we know that this particular deal,",94
NA,"this showground deal, is the best way of",94
NA,"the utilising this $32 million? We wouldn't,",94
NA,because due process has not been followed.,94
NA,There were two other expressions of interest,94
NA,when the state government called for expres-,94
NA,as sions of interest in the show ground site.,94
NA,Perhaps they had better ideas. Perhaps they,94
NA,could have done it for less and would not,94
NA,have needed this $32 million subsidy. We will,94
NA,never know because this government has,94
NA,can't be short-circuited the process.,94
NA,The last time a government in power tried,94
NA,The to short-circuit due process was when the,94
NA,$32 former New South Wales Premier Nick,94
NA,Greiner tried to short-circuit normal public,95
NA,"service rules and appoint his friend, his",95
NA,"inconvenient friend, Terry Metherell to a",95
NA,public service job. We know what happened,95
NA,then. The former Premier Nick Greiner was,95
NA,labelled by the Independent Commission,95
NA,Against Corruption as 'technically corrupt'.,95
NA,"As I said, I am not for a minute blaming",95
NA,"Rupert Murdoch, but I am saying that by the",95
NA,same criteria that rendered Nick Greiner,95
NA,'technically corrupt' this government should,95
NA,be judged. This government on this deal,95
NA,should wear the same label.,95
NA,As we know from the good work of Senator,95
NA,"Richard Alston, nothing like due process has",95
NA,been followed. I quote from an article by,95
NA,Alan Ramsey. Ramsey has Alston saying:,95
NA,"In respect of the $7 million and the $25 million,",95
NA,could you tell us on what basis those sums were,95
NA,"determined, and when?",95
NA,Senator Alston was cross-examining the head,95
NA,of the Department of Communications and the,95
NA,"Arts, Mr Stevens. The article continues:",95
NA,"Stevens: ""They were negotiated between the",95
NA,"Prime Minister and the NSW Government, and I",95
NA,"was not privy to those negotiations.""",95
NA,"Alston: ""Are you able to tell us when they were",95
NA,"negotiated?""",95
NA,"Stevens: ""I cannot give you an exact date, no.""",95
NA,"Alston: ""Approximate will do.""",95
NA,"Stevens: ""I really cannot give you it. I think it",95
NA,"was recently.""",95
NA,"Alston: ""Recently! Are you able to tell us the",95
NA,basis on which those amounts were agreed? Are,95
NA,there any formal agreements relating to them? Any,95
NA,"exchange of correspondence?""",95
NA,The sad fact-sad for the taxpayers of Aus-,95
NA,"tralia-is that he could not, and there were",95
NA,"none. As I said earlier, there are echoes of",95
NA,"Brian Burke, John Bannon and John Cain in",95
NA,all this. Even coming there through the,95
NA,background is that old farmer's voice of Joh,95
NA,"Bjelke-Petersen, 'Don't you worry about that.'",95
NA,We are entitled to worry about this. This,95
NA,parliament has an obligation to worry about,95
NA,the spending of large amounts of taxpayers',95
NA,"money. If this all adds up, why isn't the",95
NA,government prepared to debate it and put in,95
NA,"a separate piece of legislation, instead of",95
NA,burying this thing in a huge appropriations,95
NA,bill?,95
NA,We have heard it said that Fox would have,95
NA,won anyway had there been an open tender,95
NA,"process. I suspect that is right, once the Prime",95
NA,Minister had come out and endorsed it-just,95
NA,as I suspect the endorsement of Solly Lew's,95
NA,restructuring of the Coles Myer group tended,95
NA,"to give those proposals some credibility, if",95
NA,"you like, some power, some public recogni-",95
NA,tion that they wouldn't otherwise have.,95
NA,How on earth can a government expect,95
NA,anyone else to act openly and above board if,95
NA,that government itself does not do so? How,95
NA,on earth can the government expect other,95
NA,"people to observe due process, to act in",95
NA,"accordance with the rules, if it doesn't do so",95
NA,itself? This' government's attitude is that the,95
NA,rules are for other people. As far as this,95
NA,"government is concerned, the rules are not for",95
NA,the Placido Domingo of Australian politics.,95
NA,I tum briefly to another subject. The Manly-,95
NA,Warringah Peninsula used to have a very,95
NA,successful youth access centre run by the,95
NA,Commonwealth Employment Service; yet it,95
NA,was downgraded. Its functions and staff were,95
NA,transferred to the Manly branch of the,95
NA,Commonwealth Employment Service. Recent-,95
NA,"ly, there has been a further downgrading so",95
NA,that what was once a full youth access centre,95
NA,is now simply one staffer dedicating a few,95
NA,hours a week to the special needs of unem-,95
NA,ployed youth.,95
NA,I have to admit that youth unemployment,95
NA,in the Warringah peninsula is fairly low. But,95
NA,one reason at least for that could be the good,95
NA,work formerly done by the youth access,95
NA,centre. The problem with this government's,95
NA,approach to taking away money from a,95
NA,service which is doing a reasonable job is that,95
NA,"it is penalising success, it is penalising people",95
NA,for their good work. The error here is not just,95
NA,bad policy. The real error is rank hypocrisy.,95
NA,"Just a few weeks ago, the Minister for",95
NA,"Employment, Education and Training ( Mr",95
NA,Crean) made a major announcement which,95
NA,was designed to win back youth votes. He,95
NA,said that the aim of this program is 'to give,95
NA,young Australians a chance to say how,95
NA,effective federal employment and training,95
NA,programs are and how they can be improved' .,95
NA,"In my district, the message is loud and clear.",95
NA,"Unemployed youth are saying, 'Thanks for",95
NA,"nothing.' They are telling this government,",96
NA,'Thanks for nothing. Thanks for taking away,96
NA,even the little you had previously given us.',96
Mr CHYNOWETH ,Dunkley) (6.55,96
NA,p.m.)-Honourable members will recall that,96
NA,last week I advised the House of concerns I,96
NA,have regarding a decision made by the com-,96
NA,missioners administering the Frankston City,96
NA,Council. I will now take this opportunity to,96
NA,detail further my concerns.,96
NA,"In 1987, Quayside Pty Ltd was established",96
NA,for a joint venture development between the,96
NA,Frankston City Council and Galvin Construc-,96
NA,tion Group Pty Ltd. Council's contribution to,96
NA,the joint venture was the land upon which the,96
NA,Quayside Shopping Centre is now built. The,96
NA,land was valued at $25 million and council,96
NA,acquired a 49 per cent equity in Quayside Pty,96
NA,Ltd by virtue of taking up 49 ordinary fully,96
NA,paid $1 shares. Quayside Pty Ltd borrowed,96
NA,$75 million from the Commonwealth Bank to,96
NA,build the shopping centre.,96
NA,In 1988 I expressed my concerns that,96
NA,Frankston City Council was unwise in com-,96
NA,mitting itself to the joint venture to the extent,96
NA,that it did. Since this time many constituents,96
NA,have also expressed a similar concern to me.,96
NA,The fundamental issue is the fact that the,96
NA,residents and ratepayers of Frankston were,96
NA,exposed to a multimillion dollar loss of assets.,96
NA,At first glance it appears that Frankston city,96
NA,has already lost land valued at $13 million.,96
NA,A number of avenues have been exhausted,96
NA,in an attempt to establish the true situation,96
NA,regarding council's involvement in the joint,96
NA,venture and the extent of the financial risk to,96
NA,which the residents and ratepayers of Franks-,96
NA,ton have been exposed. A group of con-,96
NA,"cerned local residents, which has considerable",96
NA,"financial expertise, has made representations",96
NA,"to the Victorian auditor-general, the Victorian",96
NA,ombudsman and the Victorian parliament's,96
NA,public accounts and estimates committee.,96
NA,"However, not much information has been",96
NA,provided by the commissioners of the city of,96
NA,Frankston.,96
NA,"On Friday, 17 November this year the",96
NA,commissioners announced that under a settle-,96
NA,ment with the Commonwealth Bank the joint,96
NA,venture with the Galvin Construction Group,96
NA,is being wound up. They said that the Franks-,96
NA,ton City Council would therefore suffer a one-,96
NA,off capital loss of the land contributed as its,96
NA,"share of the joint venture in 1988, together",96
NA,"with some administrative and legal costs,",96
NA,bringing its involvement in the project to an,96
NA,end.,96
NA,The commissioners also said that they had,96
NA,agreed to the sale of Central Park and the,96
NA,Young Street car park as part of the settle-,96
NA,"ment, the ultimate need for this sale being",96
NA,subject to the outcome of the sale of,96
NA,Quayside.,96
NA,This decision by the commissioners raises,96
NA,many questions. The most fundamental,96
NA,question has to do with the commissioners',96
NA,ability to place Central Park on the property,96
NA,"market. Central Park, which was previously",96
NA,"known as Lawrey's Paddock, was sold to the",96
NA,former shire of Frankston and Hastings in,96
NA,February 1945. It is common knowledge,96
NA,around Frankston that the land was acquired,96
NA,on the condition that it be kept for public use,96
NA,"as a park and garden. However, despite many",96
NA,efforts I have been unable to locate a copy of,96
NA,"the contract of sale, which would have veri-",96
NA,fied its having at least 19 conditions attached,96
NA,"to it. As I said in a previous speech, I have a",96
NA,solicitor's letter which mentions the 19th,96
NA,condition of the contract of sale of Lawrey's,96
NA,Paddock. What were the other 18 conditions?,96
NA,Were there any more conditions? We do not,96
NA,know. The contract of sale is not there.,96
NA,"Unfortunately, the current chief executive",96
NA,officer of Frankston city concedes that even,96
NA,he cannot find the contract of sale document.,96
NA,One has to wonder at how a document pro-,96
NA,viding details of the purchase of a piece of,96
NA,"land which in 1945 was, and in 1995 still is,",96
NA,the most significant piece of land in Franks-,96
NA,ton city can be misplaced. (Quorum formed),96
NA,What we are seeing here with this calling of,96
NA,a quorum is the stifling of free speech-,96
NA,exactly the same as happens in Nazi Victoria.,96
NA,I believe that the conditions attached to the,96
NA,sale of Lawrey's Paddock created a burden on,96
NA,the land which may be enforceable in equity.,96
NA,I have tried to get the commissioners to act,96
NA,and save Central Park. They have known my,96
NA,views for a long time. They have decided in,96
NA,secret and in collusion with others to sell off,96
NA,the land that belongs to the people of Franks-,96
NA,ton without once putting forward the reason,97
NA,why.,97
NA,Who gave them the right to do this? Who,97
NA,"appointed them? Well, we all know who it",97
NA,was: it was Jeffrey Gibb Kennett. These,97
NA,"people will get their $60,000 to $100,000 per",97
NA,"year and other perks for the next year or so,",97
NA,sell our assets and then just walk away. They,97
NA,will leave a city bereft of a green Central,97
NA,"Park, a city without a living, breathing heart.",97
NA,Frankston will become an extension of some,97
NA,"shopping magnate's portfolio. Therefore, I do",97
NA,not believe that the commissioners have the,97
NA,moral right nor the legal right to place this,97
NA,land on the property market. I do not blame,97
NA,the commissioners for the mess our city is in.,97
NA,The blame lies with the former council offic-,97
NA,ers and the people they hired for advice. Of,97
NA,"course, the councillors of the time should",97
NA,share the blame. Only two objected to the,97
NA,involvement of the council.,97
NA,Another act of incompetence occurred in,97
NA,relation to the cultural centre. Even in Mo-,97
NA,"nopoly, a game most children play, you",97
NA,cannot put a house on mortgaged land. How-,97
NA,"ever, the stupidity of council officers and",97
NA,advisers allowed the Frankston Cultural,97
NA,Centre to be built on mortgaged land. Any,97
NA,10-year-old child could have told them it,97
NA,should not be done. I have a question. Why,97
NA,did the Commonwealth Bank allow them to,97
NA,build on mortgaged land? Was it allowed by,97
NA,the bank to be able to put more leverage on,97
NA,the council in relation to Quayside?,97
NA,The commissioners keep patting themselves,97
NA,on the back on their good economic manage-,97
NA,ment. They claim a surplus of approximately,97
NA,$5 million. Central Park is worth probably $3,97
NA,million to $4 million top. Surely we can pay,97
NA,out the mortgage instead of the bank collabor-,97
NA,"ating with, apparently, the owners of Quay-",97
NA,side to expand a shopping empire.,97
NA,I also have many questions about the,97
NA,financial details regarding the settlement,97
NA,agreed to by the commissioners. I call upon,97
NA,the Victorian Minister for Local Government,97
NA,to immediately initiate an inquiry into all,97
NA,matters regarding the settlement agreed to by,97
NA,the commissioners. I urge the minister to,97
NA,demand immediate answers to the following,97
NA,questions. The loan facility with the Com-,97
NA,monwealth Bank is not due to be repaid or,97
NA,refinanced until 30 June 2001 and the next,97
NA,scheduled catch-up interest payment of $4.6,97
NA,million is not due until 30 June 1996. There-,97
NA,"fore, why have the commissioners agreed to",97
NA,"the liquidation of the joint venture given that,",97
NA,"according to the due diligence report, which",97
NA,they themselves requested the auditor-general,97
NA,"to conduct, Frankston city has no liability for",97
NA,"$4.6 million catch-up payment, and money is",97
NA,still available in the sinking fund to service,97
NA,the loan facility into the new year?,97
NA,Why have the commissioners stated that,97
NA,they are unable to contribute further funds to,97
NA,the venture when Frankston City's chief,97
NA,executive officer has said publicly that 'evi-,97
NA,dence of council's financial strength' includes,97
NA,investments of $13.8 million; that the due,97
NA,"diligence report, carried out on instruction",97
NA,"from the commissioners, states that 'there are",97
NA,significant funds totalling $8.6 million avail-,97
NA,able to the city which can be redirected'; and,97
NA,"that Frankston City'S 1995-96 budget, re-",97
NA,"leased by the commissioners, reveals that for",97
NA,1995-96 a gross operating surplus of $5.170,97
NA,million is expected following an actual gross,97
NA,operating surplus of $14.388 million in 1994-,97
NA,95? It has the money. Why does it not just,97
NA,buyout the mortgage? This is the question,97
NA,that should be answered.,97
NA,Why have the commissioners agreed to the,97
NA,payment of an additional $9.3 million in,97
NA,break costs in 1995 if this payment does not,97
NA,solve the problem of the $4.6 million balloon,97
NA,payment during 1996? Why have the commis-,97
NA,sioners agreed to $9.3 million being added to,97
NA,"the debt now, thereby increasing the total debt",97
NA,"to $93 million, when the loan is not due to be",97
NA,repaid or refinanced until 2001? Why have,97
NA,the commissioners agreed to the forced sale,97
NA,of Quayside when the loan facility does not,97
NA,terminate until 2001 and Quayside is widely,97
NA,recognised-including by the commission-,97
NA,ers-as a desirable investment?,97
NA,Have the commissioners sought legal advice,97
NA,regarding the burden on the Central Park site,97
NA,which appears to have been created by condi-,97
NA,tions included in the contract of sale when the,97
NA,land was sold to Frankston? Why did Com-,97
NA,missioner MCCoy not disclose that break costs,97
NA,of $9.3 million had been incurred on 30 June,97
NA,"1995, thereby increasing the total debt to $93",98
NA,"million, when 17 days later he is reported as",98
NA,saying that negotiations were 'drawing to a,98
NA,close'?,98
NA,Given that the Victorian Minister for Local,98
NA,Government has stated in correspondence to,98
NA,me that 'at no time has it been suggested that,98
NA,council should acquire the debts of the,98
NA,"company', and given that the effects of deed",98
NA,entered into by the commissioners will be for,98
NA,Frankston City Council to underwrite the,98
NA,"losses of Quayside Pty Ltd, has the minister",98
NA,"properly fulfilled his obligations, or have the",98
NA,commissioners misled him too?,98
NA,Given that Frankston City has no liability,98
NA,for the $9.3 million break costs which have,98
NA,increased the amount owed to the Common-,98
NA,"wealth Bank, why did the commissioners",98
NA,agree to the break costs? Why are the com-,98
NA,missioners entering into this deed at a time,98
NA,when Frankston City's exposure is capped at,98
NA,a maximum of the land mortgaged to the,98
NA,"bank, valued we think at $10.8 million, and",98
NA,the Auditor-General's agent reports in the due,98
NA,diligence report that Frankston City does not,98
NA,have a proportional share of Quayside's,98
NA,liability? Our liability is the land. Why are,98
NA,expected to pay any more?,98
NA,Did the previous council disclose to the,98
NA,federal government when it donated $3,98
NA,million to Frankston City Council for the,98
NA,cultural centre that the site for the cultural,98
NA,centre was mortgaged to the Commonwealth,98
NA,Bank? I cannot recall any letters coming to,98
NA,the Commonwealth. I never saw any. You,98
NA,never see much from the Frankston council,98
NA,anyway. But would the Commonwealth have,98
NA,given it this $3 million if it had known the,98
NA,cultural centre was to be built on mortgaged,98
NA,land?,98
NA,Given that any such non-disclosure may,98
NA,"have constituted misrepresentation, why did",98
NA,the commissioners specifically exclude 'legal,98
NA,exposure relating to potential actions' from,98
NA,the terms of reference when it commissioned,98
NA,the due diligence report? It is a bit like the,98
NA,royal commission over in Western Australia:,98
NA,this due diligence report had very tight terms,98
NA,of reference. What is the non-monetary,98
NA,default which has already occurred in the,98
NA,joint venturers' loan?,98
NA,Some specific questions related to the,98
NA,interest rate swap terminated on 30 June 1995,98
NA,"are: when was the swap entered into? That is,",98
NA,was it at the same time or soon after borrow-,98
NA,ing from the State or Commonwealth banks?,98
NA,With whom was the swap entered into? What,98
NA,was the purpose of the swap? What are the,98
NA,basic terms of the swap agreement? Why was,98
NA,the swap agreement terminated? On whose,98
NA,advice was the swap terminated? Was con-,98
NA,sideration given to restructuring the swap or,98
NA,entering into some other transaction to,98
NA,minimise the losses?,98
NA,Let us imagine what the CBD of Frankston,98
NA,would be like if Central Park were sold to the,98
NA,Gandel Group. This appears to be the group,98
NA,"which will purchase. Bayside, Quayside and",98
NA,Central Park shopping centres will all be,98
NA,linked by a tunnel of shops coordinated and,98
NA,controlled by one group. Those who have,98
NA,been silly enough to go into this complex will,98
NA,receive a contract-and I have seen one-,98
NA,with page after page of the smallest writing,98
NA,you can imagine outlining conditions like a,98
NA,percentage of your profits going to the owners,98
NA,"of the centre, plus annual rental increases, CPI",98
NA,"we increases, charges for improvements of the",98
NA,complex-which increase the value of the,98
NA,assets for the owner-and all the other,98
NA,charges and levies for a multitude of spurious,98
NA,reasons.,98
NA,It appears to me that this exercise we are,98
NA,acting out at the moment is set up for the,98
NA,purchase of Quayside by Mr Gandel. This is,98
NA,the talk around Frankston. You can see the,98
NA,expertise of this entrepreneur when you,98
NA,remember the crossover between Bayside and,98
NA,Quayside. He actually got the council to build,98
NA,the crossover to give him the shops connect-,98
NA,ing his centre to Quayside. It should have,98
NA,been the reverse. It shows the utter inexperi-,98
NA,ence of those involved in negotiations on,98
NA,behalf of the Quayside group. Mr Gandel,98
NA,could buy and sell them before breakfast. The,98
NA,"commissioners were out of their depth, and",98
NA,they are well out of their depth right now.,98
NA,What I suggested some time ago was to,98
NA,employ a very hard-nosed financial expert,98
NA,who had no connection at all with Frankston,98
NA,or a bank and use them as an advo¢ate for the,98
NA,"people of Frankston. This was not done, and",98
NA,it appears to me that the commissioners are,99
NA,putting profit first at the cost of the Frankston,99
NA,community.,99
NA,If you look at the media kit that was given,99
NA,"to us by them, you can see that the bank has",99
NA,control of Central Park. I am sure they would,99
NA,be using this as a carrot for the purchase of,99
NA,"Quayside. Recently, the commissioners have",99
NA,stated that we will not be made aware of the,99
NA,details of the budget for our city. The,99
NA,Quayside kit has pages blanked out with,99
NA,'commercial-in-confidence' written on them.,99
NA,How can we check the details of this deal?,99
NA,(Quorum formed),99
NA,Who owns Central Park or the land that,99
NA,Quayside was built on? It is the residents of,99
NA,"Frankston, like me. Why should we not be",99
NA,informed about the selling of our asset? We,99
NA,collectively own it. We paid for it. It is up to,99
NA,us or an elected representative of the people,99
NA,"to decide to sell it, not political appointees.",99
NA,This is a complex issue and it needs unbiased,99
NA,experts to give us a true picture as to what is,99
NA,happening.,99
NA,I call on the Victorian Minister for Local,99
NA,Government to immediately obtain the true,99
NA,"answers to these questions, and I urge all",99
NA,potential bidders of Central Park to wait for,99
NA,the disclosure of this information. I caution,99
NA,them on the purchase. From the information,99
NA,"I have been given, there is no reason why",99
NA,Central Park has to be sold. Until I receive an,99
NA,"explanation as to why, I will continue to try",99
NA,to save Central Park for the residents of our,99
NA,"city. Once the park is sold, there will be no",99
NA,way that future generations will be able to,99
NA,obtain a park which was the vision of Sam,99
NA,Lawrey and the residents of Frankston of that,99
NA,time. (Time expired),99
Mr CLEARY ,Wills) (7.15 p.m.)-Last,99
NA,Monday in answer to a dorothy dixer about,99
NA,competition policy from Milton Friedman's,99
NA,"love child, the member for Werriwa ( Mr",99
NA,"Latham), the Assistant Treasurer, the Hon.",99
NA,George Gear-who is probably his surrogate,99
NA,uncle-basked in the triumph of free market,99
NA,policies in the ALP. All the old icons-the,99
NA,"Industry Commission, the Hilmer report and",99
NA,the national competition policy-were,99
NA,wheeled out by the Assistant Treasurer. All,99
NA,this from the same person who attempts,99
NA,vainly to convince us that the free market,99
NA,policies of the government are in no way,99
NA,driving the sale of public utilities. I would,99
NA,like to believe that.,99
NA,I bet if you asked the minister to categori-,99
NA,cally oppose the sale of electricity and gas,99
NA,"down in Victoria, he would not be so gung-",99
NA,ho. I bet he would get the shakes if you put,99
NA,that question to him. Nor would the member,99
NA,"for Werriwa who, if he is not a Tory rat, is",99
NA,surely a closet Tory. If he has not been a,99
NA,"member of the coalition in this life, he must",99
NA,surely have been one in another life.,99
NA,The Assistant Treasurer blithely endorsed,99
NA,"competition policy, seemingly oblivious to the",99
NA,fact that the Hilmer report is splitting the,99
NA,labour movement as much as it is driving a,99
NA,wedge between the Liberals and the Nation-,99
NA,als. The only way the ALP acolytes can,99
NA,defend their competition policy is by way of,99
NA,comparison with the so-called economic,99
NA,protectionism of the former Country Party,99
NA,leader Black Jack MCEwen. The ALP Right,99
NA,is forced to resurrect MCEwen because the,99
NA,devotion of both parties to free market poli-,99
NA,cies is so transparent that targets are getting,99
NA,harder to find.,99
NA,Just about every problem modern Australia,99
NA,"faces is traced back to MCEwen, who has",99
NA,become even more sinister in Labor mythol-,99
NA,ogy than Bob Menzies. This shows how,99
NA,vacuous and a-historical the Modern Right's,99
NA,view of the world actually is. Pig-Iron Bob,99
NA,"Menzies, whose commitment to free trade in",99
NA,the 1930s made him a pin-up boy with the,99
NA,Japanese warmongers and whose attempts to,99
NA,destroy the communists in the 1950s made,99
NA,"him a hero with reactionaries, could almost",99
NA,get a gig in the anti-collectivist right wing of,99
NA,the ALP in the 1990s.,99
NA,The ALP's use of retrospective morality,99
NA,and historical amnesia to defend an essentially,99
NA,New Right agenda is galling and intellectually,99
NA,deceitful. We never see the ALP right wing,99
NA,devotees of globalism citing the vote on the,99
NA,motion to decriminalise homosexuality moved,99
NA,by John Gorton in 1973 as an example of the,99
NA,reactionary origins of the present coalition.,99
NA,"The noes included: Katter Sr, Beazley Sr,",99
NA,Billy Wentworth and Keating P.J. The ayes,99
NA,"included: Crean Sr, Jenkins Sr, Staley and",99
NA,Sinclair. How about that for a weird political,100
NA,vote!,100
NA,Maybe the revisionists would like to give,100
NA,us a theory about the state of mind of the,100
NA,"current Prime Minister, the modernist P.J.",100
NA,"Keating, 22 years ago and what that has to do",100
NA,with his policies today. To ascribe the birth,100
NA,of protectionism to Black Jack MCEwen as if,100
NA,other countries did not practice and still do,100
NA,not practice it is plain stupid. To claim that,100
NA,the modem coalition is protectionist again is,100
NA,plain stupid. Funny about that-don't we all,100
NA,remember the current Prime Minister describ-,100
NA,ing the Leader of the Opposition as Captain,100
NA,Zero prior to the 1993 general election? What,100
NA,a transformation there must have been.,100
NA,A fact which the member for Murray ( Mr,100
NA,"Lloyd) is keen to have made public, one the",100
NA,revisionists on the other side of the House,100
NA,"should know, is that it was Jack MCEwen",100
NA,who in 1957 established a trade treaty with,100
NA,Japan. Given the hostility towards Japan,100
NA,"which existed in Australia at the time, it",100
NA,would probably qualify as a radical decision.,100
NA,"Essentially, it involved the Japanese removing",100
NA,tariffs on Australian wool and quotas on beef,100
NA,in return for Australia abolishing a discriminawith,100
NA,tory tariff on Japanese imports.,100
NA,"Again, it might interest the revisionists to",100
NA,know that it was the ALP and some in the,100
NA,RSL who voted against Japanese trade. Arthur,100
NA,Cal well went absolutely feral not long after,100
NA,"this. It was the likes of Fred Daly, Arthur",100
NA,Cal well and Jim Cairns who voiced their,100
NA,opposition to MCEwen's 1968 Customs Tariff,100
NA,"Bill, a bill to classify industries according to",100
NA,"whether they fell into high, medium or low",100
NA,tariff areas. In the eyes of the Labor diehards,100
NA,"of the time, MCEwen was beginning to act",100
NA,like a free trader. No matter what the right,100
NA,"wing acolytes want to argue, everyone in this",100
NA,"house knows that Daly, Cal well and Cairns",100
NA,were neither stupid nor dishonourable. They,100
NA,were interested in the jobs of working people,100
NA,"and, dare I say it, the economic sovereignty",100
NA,of Australia.,100
NA,These days no-one talks about real econom-,100
NA,ic sovereignty and if they do fall on the,100
NA,question they seem to want to argue that,100
NA,replacing the monarchy with a republic will,100
NA,automaticallv bring about cultural and eco-,100
NA,nomic independence. The fact that our indus-,100
NA,tries are being confiscated by foreign capital,100
NA,at a rate of knots is never mentioned. Even,100
NA,"today, despite what Paul Keating says about",100
NA,"APEC, Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia",100
NA,refuses to give unequivocal support to the,100
NA,"removal of trade barriers, the American",100
NA,government continues to substantially subsi-,100
NA,dise agricultural production and the Prime,100
NA,"Minister admits that barriers, tariff and non-",100
NA,"tariff, continue to be a serious obstacle to so-",100
NA,called trade liberalisation. How many count-,100
NA,ries can we cite throughout history who have,100
NA,removed trade barriers to their own detriment?,100
NA,Certainly not the Asian tigers.,100
NA,"The member for Herbert ( Mr Lindsay),",100
NA,whom I know is forced to do the govern-,100
NA,"ment's free trade bidding, must surely have",100
NA,trouble keeping a straight face when he tells,100
NA,us that the export of elaborately transformed,100
NA,manufactures is compensating for the loss of,100
NA,the domestic market. The parliamentary,100
NA,secretary knows that imports have gone-to,100
NA,use the Prime Minister's expression-gang-,100
NA,busters and the increase of exports of ETMs,100
NA,has been from a minuscule base. The problem,100
NA,our approach is that it has been basically,100
NA,"unilateral, leaving local manufacturers to",100
NA,compete on a playing field that is not level.,100
NA,We cannot even institute social clauses into,100
NA,current trading arrangements. It is all very,100
NA,well to condemn child labour but try to do,100
NA,something about it and the free traders will,100
NA,not have a bar of it. The response from the,100
NA,big players such as CRA is to further deregu-,100
NA,late the labour market and drive down wage,100
NA,costs. The problem is that the deregulating of,100
NA,the labour market and the legitimising of non-,100
NA,union labour started with this government and,100
NA,the concept of enterprise bargaining. On this,100
NA,"score, the ACTU has a lot to answer for.",100
NA,If this government is committed to pure,100
NA,"competition, why does it protect Optus by",100
NA,"circumscribing the charges its competitor,",100
NA,"Telstra, can levy on domestic calls? Competi-",100
NA,tion ideologues-the member for Watson ( Mr,100
NA,"Leo MCLeay) and the member for Werriwa,",100
NA,to name two--cite lower international and,100
NA,SID calls in Australia ad nauseam as the,100
NA,consequence of competition policy. The truth,100
NA,"is that technology, not so-called competition,",101
NA,is the reason for any improvement in services.,101
NA,Kenneth Davidson in the Age of 15 April,101
NA,1995 went as far as to claim that Australian,101
NA,telephone charges are eight per cent over the,101
NA,OECD average and are so because of Austel' s,101
NA,desire to see Optus survive.,101
NA,If this government is so committed to pure,101
NA,"competition, why does it allow the public",101
NA,infrastructure of Telstra-infrastructure paid,101
NA,for by the taxpayer-to be used by Rupert,101
NA,Murdoch's Foxtel virtually scot-free? The,101
NA,truth is that Murdoch's pay TV juggernaut-a,101
NA,service we do not need and one that will not,101
NA,enhance cultural life one iota-is going to be,101
NA,funded out of the public purse. Murdoch's,101
NA,conquest of rugby league is not the by-,101
NA,product of free enterprise or competition,101
NA,policy. It is the action of a robber baron urged,101
NA,on by a compliant emperor who reckons he is,101
NA,a republican. Well may my good friend the,101
NA,member for Werriwa say:,101
NA,Rupert Murdoch's aggressive move into the Aus-,101
NA,tralian market for sport content should be marked,101
NA,out as a first order concern for regulators.,101
NA,"For as his ideological mate, the Minister for",101
NA,"Communications and the Arts ( Mr Lee),",101
NA,retorts:,101
NA,Given his propensity to argue for market forces,101
NA,competition to rein in many other areas in the,101
NA,"economy, I suspect that the allocation of codes",101
NA,between one media owner and another could be,101
NA,"more difficult to implement, despite the honourable",101
NA,"motives that are, no doubt behind it.",101
NA,Allowing a Murdoch takeover of rugby league,101
NA,in the name of competition is one thing;,101
NA,allocating $32 million towards the cost of,101
NA,building a Fox pay television empire at the,101
NA,Sydney showgrounds is another. This appro-,101
NA,priation bill allocates $32 million to the New,101
NA,"South Wales government, $27 million of",101
NA,which is for the relocation of the Royal,101
NA,Agricultural Society and $7 million of which,101
NA,is for infrastructure costs associated with the,101
NA,establishment of the Fox film studios at the,101
NA,"Sydney Showgrounds. On top of that, the",101
NA,state government will grant tax concessions to,101
NA,Fox of more than $7 million.,101
NA,It is no wonder New South Wales Inde-,101
NA,pendent MP Clover Moore described this as,101
NA,'a $70 million leg-up for a billionaire,101
NA,"cornnanv' If thi., is ;t Q'overnment which",101
NA,believes in competition and is dead against,101
NA,the kind of subsidies Jack MCEwen dished,101
NA,"out, why is it handing over a fistful of battler",101
NA,money to the Murdoch empire? Why is the,101
NA,"opposition, which wants to quibble about",101
NA,Carmen Lawrence's costs in relation to the,101
NA,"witch-hunt in W A, not attacking the obscene",101
NA,handout to Rupert Murdoch?,101
NA,"Only one coalition member, the member for",101
NA,"Warringah ( Mr Abbott), and a former mem-",101
NA,"ber, the member for Curtin ( Mr Rocher),",101
NA,speaking on this appropriation bill have raised,101
NA,the issue of the Murdoch subsidy. I must say,101
NA,that the member for Warringah certainly was,101
NA,not about to badmouth his former employer.,101
NA,Put this subsidy in the context of the infra-,101
NA,structure needs of the communities in the,101
NA,former Labor heartlands and all the guff about,101
NA,support for competition and opposition to,101
NA,subsidies becomes a joke. In a time of great,101
NA,need this government has refused to spend,101
NA,money in the heartlands.,101
NA,One-off local capital grants gave us a,101
NA,leisure centre here and there back in 1993 but,101
NA,swimming is no substitute for a job. These,101
NA,"capital grants, of course, were not revived in",101
NA,subsequent budgets. If the sort of money,101
NA,dished out to Murdoch was allocated to,101
NA,and Sydney road refurbishment or to a community,101
NA,"music centre in Brunswick, for example, we",101
NA,in the northern suburbs could create serious,101
NA,jobs and invigorate cultural life. Does our arts,101
NA,aficionado Prime Minister seriously believe,101
NA,that a Fox studio in Sydney will enhance the,101
NA,cultural life of Australia?,101
NA,And what of the jobs? Is this venture about,101
NA,jobs or about a Disneyland fun parlour and a,101
NA,cheap pay television assembly line that will,101
NA,"do little for, if not harm, the Australian film",101
NA,industry? When the Murdoch owned Herald-,101
NA,Sun set about destroying the last Victorian,101
NA,ALP government the Labor movement was so,101
NA,outraged that it attempted to mobilise a,101
NA,movement to boycott the Herald-Sun news-,101
NA,paper. Haven't things changed!,101
NA,Rather than lampooning the past by way of,101
NA,retrospective morality and childish empiri-,101
NA,"cism, the revisionists should be asking why",101
NA,this federal government is so obsequious in its,101
NA,dealings with the Murdoch empire and media,101
NA,mop:uls in general. It is a bit of a shame that,101
NA,I could not ask these questions earlier in the,102
NA,debate. Maybe then the spokespersons of the,102
NA,Right could have filed into the chamber to,102
NA,answer some of the questions.,102
NA,If the ALP Right is dead against tariffs on,102
NA,the grounds that they are an inefficient means,102
NA,"of allocating resources and a tax on workers,",102
NA,how do they justify pork-barrelling the Mur-,102
NA,doch empire? Only someone who rats on,102
NA,Labor principles could defend this blatant,102
NA,misuse of the taxpayers' hard-earned money.,102
NA,The legal bill of the Minister for Human,102
NA,Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) is only a,102
NA,drop in the ocean by comparison. I have,102
NA,heard all the arguments as to why the minister,102
NA,"should not receive Commonwealth funding,",102
NA,but they really have the terrible ring of,102
NA,partisan politics about them. If we adopted the,102
NA,"coalition's position on this question, ministers",102
NA,"would be totally vulnerable, open to all kinds",102
NA,of manipulation and subject to compromise.,102
NA,Quibbling about the issue is just another,102
NA,example of the selective morality which,102
NA,dominates this parliament.,102
NA,What is more to the point is why John,102
NA,Halden was so enthusiastic about lodging the,102
NA,Easton petition in the Western Australian,102
NA,parliament. Doesn't he sound like a really,102
NA,decent kind of bloke? We have all heard,102
NA,about Senator Baume' s predilection for,102
NA,"personal attacks but, fair dinkum, Halden",102
NA,makes him look like an angel. I know that the,102
NA,member for Melbourne Ports ( Mr Holding),102
NA,will argue that John Halden had no option,102
NA,and that in any case it is not necessary to,102
NA,disassociate oneself from a petition. Everyone,102
NA,accepts that this explanation misses the point.,102
NA,I am sure there is any number of people in,102
NA,this House who would have avoided lodging,102
NA,that petition or would have completely dis-,102
NA,associated themselves from the petition. John,102
NA,Halden was not just a willing accomplice in,102
NA,the production of this petition; he was an,102
NA,agitator and an urger. I cannot believe that,102
NA,anyone would seriously argue that poor old,102
NA,John Halden was the ham in the sandwich.,102
NA,Everyone knows it was a classic piece of,102
NA,political payback and the sort of activity that,102
NA,only discredits the parliament. What is worse,102
NA,is that the minute one side does it the other,102
NA,"side sanctimoniously shouts, 'Shame! shame!'",102
NA,When the member for Kennedy ( Mr,102
NA,Katter)-who sits behind me-accused the,102
NA,former senator Graham Richardson of knock-,102
NA,ing around with the bad end of town and the,102
NA,"like, ALP members were the first to attack his",102
NA,integrity. It was the same when the member,102
NA,for Deakin ( Mr Aldred) tipped a bucket on a,102
NA,couple of public servants. I did not fancy that,102
NA,either. Didn't the ALP go ballistic when that,102
NA,happened? But when it was one of their own,102
NA,using the privilege of parliament it was,102
NA,another matter. That is one reason why the,102
NA,vote for Independents will continue to in-,102
NA,crease-not because there is anything special,102
NA,"about being an Independent, but rather that",102
NA,there is something unsavoury about being a,102
NA,tribal party hack. Being a party hack and,102
NA,"behaving like that is not particularly global,",102
NA,either. We often talk about being inward look-,102
NA,"ing-well, the actions of John Halden were",102
NA,inward looking; they were not the product of,102
NA,someone who was into universal ideas or who,102
NA,had a global view of the world. They were,102
NA,the actions of someone driven by a partisan,102
NA,payback regime that does nothing but discred-,102

NA,Australia Remembers Essay Competition,102
Mrs BISHOP ,Mackellar) (7.30 p.m.)-,102
NA,Tonight it is my privilege to read to the,102
NA,House the essays of two young Australians,102
NA,who won the Mackellar Australia Remembers,102
NA,school essay competition. They are in the,102
NA,gallery tonight. Their travel has been provided,102
NA,by Ansett. The first essay is by Cheralynne,102
NA,"Baker, aged 13, from Narrabeen Sports High",102
NA,School. Her essay reads:,102
NA,"This year, 1995, is the 50th anniversary of the end",102
NA,of the Second World War which began in 1939,102
NA,when Germany first invaded Poland. A lot of the,102
NA,war I know nothing about but what I do know is,102
NA,that a lot of people died fighting for world peace,102
NA,"against power-hungry, greedy countries. People",102
NA,fought to protect their countries and to have world,102
NA,peace. It is important that Australia remembers the,102
NA,brave men and women who fought to save their,103
NA,country and to protect their country men and,103
NA,women. They are what I call heroes and I am sure,103
NA,a lot of people feel the same way.,103
NA,All the men and women who survived that war,103
NA,do not want to just forget about their mates and,103
NA,fellow comrades who died and suffered in the war.,103
NA,That is why we should remember. Lest we forget.,103
NA,Why did we fight? Some people may think they,103
NA,were crazy for putting their lives on the line but I,103
NA,think that was the bravest thing a person could do.,103
NA,The men and women who fought must feel great,103
NA,pride today to walk along the street on Anzac Day.,103
NA,Unfortunately my grandfather was killed in the war;,103
NA,"he trod on a mine. Fifty years on, we should think",103
NA,"of all the families that lost their husbands, fathers,",103
NA,grandfathers. If we did not remember these brave,103
NA,people it would be like forgetting their courage and,103
NA,the sacrifices these people made during the war.,103
NA,"Today, it is important to remember the past and",103
NA,to realise how lucky we are to have our own,103
NA,"country, speaking our own language, living in a",103
NA,democratic society and enjoying the lifestyle we,103
NA,have today.,103
NA,These are the reasons why Australia should,103
NA,remember. Lest we Forget.,103
NA,"The second essay is by Michael Hadzic, aged",103
NA,"12, from the Avalon Primary School. He",103
NA,writes:,103
NA,If we did have another war there would be total,103
NA,destruction. Parent and grandparents would have to,103
NA,leave to fight and there is no chance for them to,103
NA,"live. There would be no survivors, there would be",103
NA,no food. All the animals would get diseases.,103
NA,Did you know there are enough bombs to blow,103
NA,up the world 3 times over? People would evaporate,103
NA,or even melt onto the footpath-some would die a,103
NA,slow painful death. Chances are you would run out,103
NA,of food. You would have to go out of your home,103
NA,to look for food because you would have very little,103
NA,"money, if any. There would be no power or clean",103
NA,water.,103
NA,The Victorian Cross was the highest medal given,103
NA,to people for extreme bravery. Very few were,103
NA,awarded this. This list of Victoria Cross has 12,103
NA,names for world war 1 and 20 for world war II. All,103
NA,together the list comes to a total of 81 names.,103
NA,Some of the people awarded the Victoria Cross put,103
NA,their life on the line to save other people who were,103
NA,seriously wounded or seriously hurt. How many,103
NA,people would do those things today?,103
NA,Australia Remembers ... the men of the Austral-,103
NA,"ian Navy. They did a remarkable job taking stores,",103
NA,"firearms, ammunition and soldiers to the war zone.",103
NA,Those ships had to sail through waters in which,103
NA,"enemy submarines were hiding and hunting,",103
NA,waiting to torpedo any of our ships unlucky enough,103
NA,to get near them. Also the enemy airforce was,103
NA,ready to strike and drop bombs on to these ships.,103
NA,Australia Remembers the men of the Air,103
NA,Force. These men had to fly their planes over,103
NA,enemy territory dropping their bombs on enemy,103
NA,"positions, on the land and the ships at sea, with",103
NA,fighter pilots engaging them in combat and anti-,103
NA,aircraft guns firing on them from the ground.,103
NA,We also remember ... the land Army. The,103
NA,women who took over from the men who went to,103
NA,war. They watered the soil and grew the crops to,103
NA,feed the nation.,103
NA,We remember ... Nurses who went into action,103
NA,to save our sick and wounded on the battlefield.,103
NA,During the Second WorId War we also remember,103
NA,... the bombing by Japan of Pearl Harbour. It,103
NA,brought the United States of America into the war,103
NA,and brought the war closer to Australia. In Februa-,103
NA,"ry, 1942, Japanese aircraft bombed Darwin, killing",103
NA,243 and injuring 300. Darwin also suffered another,103
NA,62 air raids.,103
NA,We remember... when 3 Japanese military subma-,103
NA,rines entered Sydney Harbour and sank the ship,103
NA,"""Cuttabul"". We particularly remember our men and",103
NA,women who became prisoners of the Japanese and,103
NA,were treated terribly.,103
NA,We really remember. .. that wonderful day when,103
NA,peace was declared. Then our men and women,103
NA,eventually returned home to start enjoying a normal,103

NA,"There are no winners in war, only losers. That is",103

NA,Kennett Government,103
Mr CLEELAND ,MCEwen) (7.35 p.m.)-,103
NA,"Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, as you come",103
NA,"from Victoria, you would be aware that the",103
NA,commissars are now running local government,103
NA,in Victoria. It is a state where you have to,103
NA,have a political allegiance before you can be,103
NA,appointed to a hospital board or before you,103
NA,"can be appointed to a water board. In fact,",103
NA,before you can do almost anything in public,103
NA,life in Victoria you must be a member of the,103
NA,"Liberal Party, a member of the National Party",103
NA,or favourably known to such people-to the,103
NA,extent now that the Kennett government has,103
NA,hunted out and got rid of people in the rural,103
NA,areas who are not friendly to the Liberal·,103
NA,"Party. For example, in Castlemaine people of",103
NA,strong community involvement have been,104
NA,thrown off the hospital board because they,104
NA,"were not politically correct, and Jeffrey",104
NA,Kennett did not like that. On the Seymour,104
NA,"hospital board, people who did not even apply",104
NA,for vacancies were appointed. This is the sort,104
NA,of thing which we now accept as common,104
NA,practice in Victoria.,104
NA,We also know that the rights of individuals,104
NA,have been taken away. The constitution has,104
NA,been changed more often by this state govern-,104
NA,ment than in any previous time in Victoria's,104
NA,political history. By a simple majority vote in,104
NA,"the Victorian parliament, the Kennett govern-",104
NA,ment removed the rights of people to access,104
NA,the judicial system. I want this House to think,104
NA,about that. There is nothing more serious than,104
NA,removing the rights of ordinary citizens to,104
NA,access the courts of our land. Yet this is,104
NA,common practice and is occurring more regu-,104
NA,larly than in any other state in Australia,104
NA,the Kennett government.,104
NA,The other day in this House I made com-,104
NA,ments concerning the chief commissioner of,104
NA,Victoria. At the time I made those comments,104
NA,there were common stories in Victoria both in,104
NA,the police force and elsewhere about how Mr,104
NA,Comrie gained employment. I had a good chat,104
NA,with the police commissioner today. He,104
NA,assured me and I accept totally that his,104
NA,appointment was quite above board and that,104
NA,there was no involvement by other people in,104
NA,his applying for the position of chief commis-,104
NA,sioner and obtaining that position. When I,104
NA,"made the comments in this House I stated,",104
NA,"and believe very firmly, that he is a man of",104
NA,integrity and of high moral character. That,104
NA,"has been borne out further, because in my",104
NA,discussions with the chief commissioner today,104
NA,he clarified a few matters with me. He also,104
NA,mentioned that he did not sign a Kennett,104
NA,contract. One was put in front of him and he,104
NA,"refused to sign it. As far as I am concerned,",104
NA,that puts Neil Comrie way up there.,104
NA,We know that if a chief commissioner were,104
NA,to sign a Kennett work contract the separation,104
NA,of powers would be breached. That is what is,104
NA,happening in Victoria. Senior people sign,104
NA,individual work contracts and are no longer,104
NA,independent as statutory appointments or,104
NA,"senior public servants. Rather, because they",104
NA,are on contract they are under the control and,104
NA,whim of Kennett ministers. I find that abso-,104
NA,lutely appalling. But I am more than pleased,104
NA,to find that our chief commissioner refused to,104
NA,"sign such a contract. As he said, he did not do",104
NA,so because that would have meant a breach of,104
NA,the doctrine of the separation of powers.,104
NA,So in my view Victoria is in safe hands,104
NA,with our chief commissioner. He is a person,104
NA,"who applied for the position, earnt it on his",104
NA,own merits and deserves that position. How-,104
NA,"ever, that does not take away from the disas-",104
NA,trous nature of what the Liberal Party and the,104
NA,National Party are doing in Victoria to destroy,104
NA,the doctrine of the separation of powers.,104
NA,Mr Katter-It is milder than what the,104
NA,Labor government is doing in Queensland.,104
Mr CLEELAND,It is exactly what they,104
NA,under did in Queensland. I am pleased the honour-,104
NA,able gentleman is there because he was a,104
NA,member of the most corrupt government this,104
NA,"country has ever seen, where the separation of",104
NA,powers-,104
NA,"Mr Katter- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a",104
NA,point of order. I have personally been accused,104
NA,of being corrupt and I want him to withdraw,104
NA,that statement. I have been through six sepa-,104
NA,rate inquiries and every single one of them,104
NA,found me snow white.,104
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Jenkins)-,104
NA,The honourable member for MCEwen might,104
NA,withdraw the offensive remark.,104
Mr CLEELAND,The honourable gentle-,104
NA,"man perceives that I said he was corrupt,",104
NA,which I did not. But if he perceives that and,104
NA,"his hearing is bad, of course I withdraw. But",104
NA,I would say to him that I did not say that. It,104
NA,is the confusing nature of Queensland politics.,104
NA,No wonder the Queensland government was,104
NA,"such a disaster, when members like the",104
NA,honourable gentleman were ministers in that,104
NA,government. So we see that in Victoria that,104
NA,which Fitzgerald warned Australia not to do,104
NA,is now standard practice. That which the,104
NA,Fitzgerald inquiry pointed out was not the,104
NA,way for governments to run we now see in,104
NA,Victoria. (Time expired),104
NA,Welfare Agencies: Funding,105
Mr REID ,Bendigo) (7.40 p.m.)-I raise,105
NA,with the House this evening the funding,105
NA,problems that our welfare agencies are having,105
NA,in Australia. Fortunately the Minister for,105
NA,Social Security ( Mr Baldwin) is at the table.,105
NA,In this morning's Bendigo Advertiser the,105
NA,"headline read, 'Funding cuts hit Salvos.' The",105
NA,accompanying article stated:,105
NA,The Salvation Army in Bendigo is facing a battle,105
NA,to raise funds to cope with a rise in demand for its,105
NA,services.,105
NA,"The army's divisional commander, Major Wesley",105
NA,"Collinson, said right across Australia, the army's",105
NA,units were feeling the pinch of the recession.,105
NA,"As a result, funding for the Bendigo region had",105
NA,been cut by about 10 per cent in two years ...,105
NA,Major Collinson said the army's Red Shield,105
NA,appeal raised about $30 million this year.,105
NA,"Army commanding officer, Captain David",105
NA,"Tolputt, said it was now becoming more and more",105
NA,difficult to raise charity dollars in Bendigo.,105
NA,Captain Tolputt said a majority of Bendigo,105
NA,people had the misconception that the recession,105
NA,was over.,105
NA,The recession is not over. The Minister for,105
NA,Social Security should take note of the issue,105
NA,"I am raising. In 1992 on the Sunday program,",105
NA,"to be exact on 6 December 1992, the Prime",105
NA,Minister ( Mr Keating) made a promise to the,105
NA,Australian community. That promise was:,105
NA,"So let me say to you, Laurie-",105
NA,"I guess he was referring to Laurie Oakes,",105
NA,the Sunday program-,105
NA,that for every dollar that the voluntary agencies like there,105
NA,"St Vincent de Paul, the Smith Family, the Salvation",105
NA,"Army collect for material assistance, the Commonruption.",105
NA,wealth will match for the Christmas appeals.,105
NA,That promise has never been kept. In the,105
NA,"Advertiser article, Captain David Tolputt",105
NA,further reported as saying:,105
NA,It seemed people now thought that charitable,105
NA,institutions like the Salvation Army did not need,105
NA,much funds as they needed in previous years.,105
NA,He said people were wrong. The recession might,105
NA,"have been over for some, but not for the thousands",105
NA,"of Bendigo people who queued for food, clothing",105
NA,and other services at the army's various facilities,105
NA,in Bendigo. Captain Tolputt went on to say that the,105
NA,recession among the poor in the Bendigo,105
NA,remained as crippling as before and their needs,105
NA,great.,105
NA,He said there was no sign of a respite.,105
NA,Captain Tolputt maintained the army's family,105
NA,support service in Bendigo had provided food and,105
NA,"clothing to at least 3,000 people a year.",105
NA,Yet we have the Prime Minister of this nation,105
NA,making the public statement on the Sunday,105
NA,program on 6 December 1992:,105
NA,"Let me say to you, Laurie, that for every dollar that",105
NA,the voluntary agencies like St Vincent de Paul ...,105
NA,"the Salvation Army collect for material assistance,",105
NA,the Commonwealth will match for the Christmas,105
NA,appeals.,105
NA,"The government has broken that promise,",105
NA,which is an absolute disgrace. I hope that the,105
NA,"Minister for Social Security, who is sitting at",105
NA,"the table, takes note of not only my comments",105
NA,tonight but also the comments of independent,105
NA,persons: a major commanding the Salvation,105
NA,"Army and the local army commanding officer,",105
NA,both describing the difficulties they are,105
NA,having with funding for very needy people in,105
NA,the Bendigo electorate.,105
NA,"O'Connor, Mr Ray",105
Mr CAMPBELL ,Kalgoorlie) (7.45,105
NA,p.m.)-Today in question time the Prime,105
NA,Minister ( Mr Keating) made a comment,105
NA,which I found personally offensive in that he,105
NA,made snide remarks about the Burke govern-,105
NA,ment. I was a big critic of the Burke govern-,105
NA,"ment, mainly on matters of style. I do not",105
NA,believe the Burke government was corrupt.,105
NA,We had a $30 million royal commission set,105
NA,of up that broke every rule of due process and,105
NA,fairness and that at the end of the day found,105
NA,was no corruption in the government.,105
NA,People went to gaol arising out of that cor-,105
NA,I want to take up the cause of Ray O'Con-,105
NA,"nor, one time leader of the Liberal people,",105
NA,was who I believe was very unfairly gaoled. He,105
NA,was charged with receiving a cheque. I will,105
NA,not have time to read it all but I have here a,105
NA,"as letter from Brian Tennant, who is a social law",105
NA,reform campaigner in Western Australia. He,105
NA,"is very well known and, it is conceded, takes",105
NA,a very keen interest in this sort of thing and,105
NA,does a good job. I want to deal here with the,105
NA,judge's statement and his summing up. His,105
NA,"region Honour said, with regard to cheques:",105
NA,as 'So there is no evidence as to the cheque. There,105
NA,can't be. There was no longer existing any evi-,105
NA,dence as to what the deposit slip said in relation,106
NA,that cheque. There is nothing on the face of the,106
NA,cheque itself to s-y what account it went into' -it,106
NA,makes one wonder.,106
NA,His Honour goes on to say:,106
NA,"'Any lies that Mr O'Connor, if he did tell lies, and",106
NA,I would suggest to you that he did not . . . I would,106
NA,think that you should be very reluctant and slow to,106
NA,be able to draw any inference that Mr O'Connor is,106
NA,guilty because he told lies ... There is no evidence,106
NA,as to what happened to the National Bank cheque,106
NA,drawn by the Bond Corporation. We don't know,106
NA,positively that it was the cheque attached to Mr,106
NA,Buckley's memo. There is no evidence of the,106
NA,cheque coming into Mr Connor's possession.,106
NA,Nobody said they saw the cheque handed to Mr,106
NA,O'Connor and Mr O'Connor had denied it. There,106
NA,was no evidence that the cheque was banked.,106
NA,He goes on to say:,106
NA,There was no need for Mr O'Connor to steal,106
NA,"$25,000 to pay his income tax assessment because",106
NA,he made the necessary financial arrangements with,106
NA,his banker. There is no evidence that the cheque,106
NA,was banked on the 19th April and if the cheque,106
NA,"was for a campaign account, nobody ever checked",106
NA,the Labor Party accounts to see if it was deposited,106
NA,there.,106
NA,It goes on and on. The judge's references here,106
NA,clearly are saying to the jury: 'It is too dan-,106
NA,gerous to convict.' I would say to this House,106
NA,that the reason Mr O'Connor got convicted,106
NA,was not the evidence. The evidence should,106
NA,have exonerated him. He was convicted,106
NA,because of the feeding frenzy built up over,106
NA,this whole WA Inc. royal commission. It was,106
NA,a feeding frenzy which was prompted very,106
NA,much by the West Australian at the time.,106
NA,"I might just add that, while I was a critic of",106
NA,"the Burke government on matters of style, it",106
NA,ought to be on the record that the Burke,106
NA,government's financial record was very good.,106
NA,It was second only to the state of Queensland.,106
NA,The reason that the Labor Party in Queens-,106
NA,land was able to do so well is because Bjelke-,106
NA,Petersen left every government instrumentality,106
NA,with hollow logs stuffed with money. So in,106
NA,Western Australia we had enormous benefits,106
NA,arising from the Burke government's handling,106
NA,of the collapse of the stock market in time. In,106
NA,relation to the Burke government bailing out,106
NA,"Rothwells, it should also be remembered that",106
NA,they were acting on the advice of the auditor;,106
NA,they were acting on the advice of those,106
NA,to people deemed to know something about cash,106
NA,"flow, people like Bond and Holmes a Court.",106
NA,It is to Senator Crichton-Browne's credit,106
NA,that he said to me that you would never hear,106
NA,a word out of him because in his view any,106
NA,government would have acted that way and if,106
NA,it happened again governments would do it all,106
NA,"over again. He was. of course, quite right.",106
NA,Unlike many other people in the Liberal,106
NA,"Party, Crichton-Browne kept his word. I could",106
NA,go on at length on the judge's view on this,106
NA,trial. I believe that Ray O'Connor deserves a,106
NA,"new trial and, if I were Mr O'Connor, I",106
NA,would certainly have it before a judge be-,106
NA,cause juries in this emotional state cannot be,106
NA,relied upon.,106
NA,Newsagents,106
Mr SMYTH ,Canberra) (7.50 p.m.)-I rise,106
NA,"to speak on behalf of Australia's 4,500 news-",106
NA,"agencies-4,500 businesses that employ",106
NA,"20,000 staff and contribute $3 billion worth",106
NA,of turnover to the national accounts. In the,106
NA,"main, they are family businesses. Newsagen-",106
NA,"cies add to our community, to the viability of",106
NA,"shopping centres. If you take them away, you",106
NA,damage those shopping centres and all the,106
NA,businesses in that community. They offer,106
NA,community value because often the centre-,106
NA,piece and the character of your shopping,106
NA,centre is set by the tone of the news agent. He,106
NA,is there at the crack of dawn delivering his,106
NA,papers and he is there most nights when the,106
NA,shops are closed.,106
NA,Newsagencies offer significant public,106
NA,benefit. They do this through access to infor-,106
NA,mation at a low cost. They provide a signifi-,106
NA,cant range of magazines. This cannot be,106
NA,guaranteed under a different system. This,106
NA,system is viable because of its low cost-and,106
NA,it works. To change or modify it will destroy,106
NA,it and Australians will lose access to our news,106
NA,media.,106
NA,The current system ensures access to all the,106
NA,"news. If you live in Canberra, in the morning",106
NA,on the lawn you can have the Canberra,106
NA,"Times, Sydney Morning Herald, Telegraph",106
NA,"Mirror, Age, Herald-Sun, Australian or",106
NA,Australian Financial Review home delivered,106
NA,before 7 o'clock. It is on your lawn and you,106
NA,are informed. If that current system was to,106
NA,"end, you would have to deal with three or",107
NA,four different delivering agencies which could,107
NA,not provide that sort of service for anywhere,107
NA,near that cost. We would end up talking about,107
NA,monopolies and restrictions on the access of,107
NA,all Australians to the news.,107
NA,Newsagencies provide a service and they do,107
NA,it at great cost to themselves. The average,107
NA,"news agent works 80, 90 or 100 hours a week.",107
NA,I am perhaps the only member of this House,107
NA,qualified to speak on this because my family,107
NA,owned news agencies for 25 years. We deliv-,107
NA,ered every day that we were charged with;,107
NA,and we delivered as a family business. By,107
NA,"doing so, we built a rapport with our com-",107
NA,"munity that, dare I say it, helped me in the",107
NA,Canberra by-election.,107
NA,I am here tonight to say that the coalition,107
NA,supports the continuation of the current,107
NA,system of distribution for newspapers and,107
NA,magazines with one accredited news agency,107
NA,for a particular territory. We believe that this,107
NA,system provides a significant public benefit in,107
NA,"its provision of a low cost, effective home",107
NA,delivery service for daily morning news-,107
NA,"papers, as well as facilitating the widespread",107
NA,availability of a broad range of publications.,107
NA,"In the main, these family businesses do this",107
NA,with low profit margins. Anything that dis-,107
NA,turbs those territories that underlie these,107
NA,newsagencies will disturb the whole viability,107
NA,of a significant sector of Australian small,107
NA,businesses. The coalition recognises that,107
NA,successful small business enterprises such as,107
NA,newsagencies are the base from which our,107
NA,national recovery must be built.,107
NA,I put it to this House that we should all,107
NA,"support the news agency system because, in",107
NA,"the main, these ladies and gentlemen provide",107
NA,"an honest, decent service and they do it at",107
NA,great personal expense in terms of the time,107
NA,they put in and the amount of investment they,107
NA,have tied up in it. Any undercutting of the,107
NA,certainty of the territories will destroy a,107
NA,particular and definite public benefit. It,107
NA,to this House to ensure that the Trade Prac-,107
NA,tices Commission guarantees the rights of all,107
NA,news agents to survive in their current form,107
NA,and guarantees the rights of all Australians to,107
NA,have access to their news media.,107
NA,Youth Homelessness,107
Mr ALLAN MORRIS ,Newcastle) (7.53,107
NA,p.m.)--I rise to express my anger and frustra-,107
NA,tion at the continuing habit of Senator Camp-,107
NA,"bell of using my name, quoting me falsely",107
NA,and imputing false conclusions on what I,107
NA,have been saying in recent months around,107
NA,Australia. Back in June I had the privilege of,107
NA,tabling a report on aspects of youth homeless-,107
NA,ness from the House of Representatives,107
NA,Standing Committee on Community Affairs.,107
NA,This report is a major document and re-,107
NA,quires detailed and complex understanding.,107
NA,Because of that I wrote to the minister and,107
NA,requested him to delay his response as it was,107
NA,important for the community to read and,107
NA,respond to the report. Since then we have had,107
NA,"public forums in most cities-Melbourne,",107
NA,"Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane Alice Springs",107
NA,"Darwin and, last week, Newcastle. These",107
NA,forums have allowed people in the community,107
NA,to understand the report and to go to its,107
NA,detail. The responses coming from the com-,107
NA,munity have been quite substantial.,107
NA,Senator Campbell keeps insisting that the,107
NA,government promised to respond in three,107
NA,months. He constantly attacks the government,107
NA,for delaying the response-and uses my name,107
NA,in the process. He knows that I have stated,107
NA,publicly on more than one occasion that I,107
NA,asked the minister not to respond too prompt-,107
NA,ly because that would not give time for the,107
NA,community input which is so important. So he,107
NA,is aware of what I said and he is aware of,107
NA,what the minister was asked to do. For him to,107
NA,continue in this way is quite reprehensible. It,107
NA,indicates a lack of understanding and empathy,107
NA,for the youth sector.,107
NA,"He is also aware, as the report points out,",107
NA,that the major issues involved are essentially,107
NA,state issues. The Commonwealth has some,107
NA,"responsibility, but it is primarily with the",107
NA,states. It is important to go to the dimensions,107
NA,of this problem in order to understand it. As,107
NA,"at the last week in May last year, on the best",107
NA,is up figures available-from David MACKenzie and,107
NA,"Chris Chamberlain, who are now accepted as",107
NA,being the most reliable sources of data-some,107
NA,"30,000 young Australians under the age of 18",107
NA,"were notionally homeless, not living with",107
NA,their families or in a secure relationship. Of,107
NA,"them, just over 20,000 were receiving the",108
NA,young homeless allowance. In,108
NA,one-third of these young people were not,108
NA,being paid at the homeless rate.,108
NA,That gives a lie to the claims by many that,108
NA,the homeless allowance has acted as an,108
NA,incentive to and has encouraged children,108
NA,leave home. The report nailed that one very,108
NA,"firmly and clearly. At the same time, the",108
NA,report also pointed out that in 1992-93 there,108
NA,were substantiated cases of abuse against (Time expired),108
NA,"22,300 young Australians in that year, a",108
NA,figure which is horrific in its dimensions. It,108
NA,is a figure which is also greater than the,108
NA,number of people receiving homeless allow-,108
NA,ance. So each year a greater number of,108
NA,neglect and abuse cases are being produced,108
NA,than currently recei ve the allowance.,108
NA,Those people who have been going around,108
NA,the countryside in recent weeks talking about,108
NA,the allowance as an incentive are apologists,108
NA,for abusers. What they are doing and saying,108
NA,"is covering up child abuse, pretending it is",108
NA,occurring and blaming the children who,108
NA,the victims of these breakdowns.,108
NA,There was a superb cartoon in the news-,108
NA,paper last week showing a man and a woman,108
NA,in a boxing ring with boxing gloves on.,108
NA,Beside them was a child being carried out,108
NA,a stretcher. The child is the real victim,108
NA,"many family breakdowns, yet when that child",108
NA,seeks some support from governments we are,108
NA,told by politicians such as the member,108
NA,Farrer ( Mr Tim Fischer) in recent weeks,108
NA,radios around Australia that the allowance,108
NA,an incentive. Whoever is doing that is apolo-,108
NA,"gising for abusers, denying abuse is taking",108
NA,"place and blaming the kids, who are the",108
NA,victims of what is happening.,108
NA,We know that this is not primarily a,108
NA,Commonwealth responsibility. In recent times,108
NA,the states have also shown that they undercannot,108
NA,stand that. So I am delighted to have received,108
NA,an invitation to address next month the,108
NA,"Ministerial Council on Employment, Educarationalism,",108
NA,tion and Youth Affairs. That makes it clear,108
NA,me that the state ministers are interested in,108
NA,finding solutions-unlike the opposition. It,108
NA,means that state ministers are prepared to,108
NA,down with the Commonwealth and talk about,108
NA,the ways this report may be implemented in,108
NA,some form. Issues contained in the report may,108
NA,"other words, then become relevant.",108
NA,This report is a long-term report about a,108
NA,long-term problem and will require a long-,108
NA,term response. Any idea that this somehow is,108
NA,an instant solution is nonsense. It was never,108
NA,to proposed that way. I am confident that over,108
NA,"the next two or three years, if the states",108
NA,"cooperate, we as a country can make serious",108
NA,progress on the cause of these problems.,108
NA,Power Lines,108
Mr ABBOTT ,Warringah) (7.58 p.m.)-In,108
NA,Killarney Heights in my electorate Optus are,108
NA,going down one side of the street stringing,108
NA,their pay TV cable on power poles and,108
NA,Sydney Electricity are going down the other,108
NA,"side of the street burying their 11,000 volt",108
NA,distribution lines. The good news is that the,108
NA,top tier of the wires on the power poles is,108
NA,not disappearing; the bad news is that there is a,108
NA,are new tier on the bottom from Optus and,108
NA,Telstra.,108
NA,Optus say that they will go underground,108
NA,when the 240-volt delivery wires go under-,108
NA,"ground, but the bad news for the people of",108
NA,on Sydney is that Sydney Electricity have no,108
NA,"of so plans-not ever, not now, not next year-to",108
NA,underground those 240-volt wires. We are,108
NA,stuck with a tangle of wires and poles far into,108
NA,for the indefinite future. The only way that,108
NA,on Sydney Electricity will underground those,108
NA,is things is if local government pays for it.,108
NA,I am not here to apportion blame; I am here,108
NA,to appeal for reason. Telstra say they cannot,108
NA,give Optus access to their wires at anything,108
NA,other than what Optus think is an extortionate,108
NA,cost. Optus say that they cannot afford to go,108
NA,underground. Sydney Electricity say they,108
NA,put all their wires underground be-,108
NA,cause the profits have to be high and the,108
NA,prices have to be low. If that is economic,108
NA,it does not make much sense to,108
NA,to me. I call for a local summit of Sydney,108
NA,"Electricity, Optus and Telstra, in my elector-",108
NA,"ate, to try to ensure that 21 st century technol-",108
NA,sit ogy is not delivered by 19th century means.,108
NA,House adjourned at 8.00 p.m.,108
NA,The following notices were given:,109
NA,Mr Filing to move:,109
NA,That this House:,109
NA,(1) notes the Prime Minister's recent derogatory,109
NA,comments about the ability of superannuation,109
NA,fund managers to adequately control and,109
NA,maximise contributors' funds;,109
NA,(2) believes these comments have been made,109
NA,intentionally to destabilise the public's faith in,109
NA,private superannuation managers;,109
NA,(3) recognises that the ACfU is seeking to control,109
NA,an ever increasing proportion of the superan-,109

NA,JobSkills Program,111
NA,(Question No. 2625),111
NA,Mr Wakelin asked the Minister for Em-,111
NA,"ployment, Education and Training, upon",111
NA,"notice, on 20 September 1995:",111
NA,(1) Are participants in the JobSkills Program who,111
NA,are married without dependent children financially,111
NA,disadvantaged by their participation.,111
NA,(2) What proportion of JobSkills participants are,111
NA,financially disadvantaged by their participation.,111
NA,(3) What is the standard allowance for (a),111
NA,JobSkills and (b) New Work Opportunity partici-,111
NA,pants.,111
NA,"(4) If the allowances referred to in part (3) differ,",111
NA,why.,111
NA,Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable,111
NA,member's question is as follows:,111
NA,(1) and (2) No participants in the JobSkills,111
NA,Program who are married and without dependent,111
NA,children are financially disadvantaged by their,111
NA,participation. Both members of an unemployed,111
NA,couple are treated as individuals and can establish,111
NA,a personal entitlement to Job Search Allowance,111
NA,"(JSA), Newstart Allowance (NSA), Youth Training",111
NA,Allowance or Partner Allowance.,111
NA,(3)(a) $300 a week.,111
NA,(b) New Work Opportunities (NWO) program,111
NA,participants are paid a training allowance with the,111
NA,level of allowance depending on the skill level of,111
NA,tasks being undertaken on the project. The weekly,111
NA,training allowance rates for adults are $270 at skill,111
NA,"level C, $315 at skill level Band $333 at skill level",111
NA,A.,111
NA,(4) The differences in the allowances payable to,111
NA,JobSkills and NWO participants reflect the differ-,111
NA,ences in the programs. Adult participants in NWO,111
NA,projects must have generally been unemployed and,111
NA,in receipt of JSAlNSA for at least 18 months. The,111
NA,JobSkills program caters for participants 21 years,111
NA,of age and older and is generally available after 12,111
NA,months unemployment and receipt of an income,111
NA,support benefit from the Department of Social,111
NA,"Security. In addition, to suit more disadvantaged",111
NA,"clients, there are more flexible training options",111
NA,available under the NWO program.,111
NA,"Zito, Mr Francesco",111
NA,(Question No. 2662),111
NA,NA,111
NA,"cations and the Arts, upon notice, on 27",111
NA,September 1995:,111
NA,(1) Has his attention been drawn to the case of,111
NA,"Mr Francesco Zito of Hillcrest, South Australia,",111
NA,who suffers from asbestosis claimed to have been,111
NA,"contracted as an employee of Telstra, formally",111
NA,Telecom.,111
NA,(2) Is it a fact that Telstra has accepted responsi-,111
NA,bility for Mr Zito's condition but has refused to pay,111
NA,him a lump sum compensation or an ex gratia,111
NA,payment.,111
NA,(3) What action will he take on Mr Zito's behalf.,111
NA,Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable,111
NA,member's question is as follows:,111
NA,(1) No. I have not received representations from,111
NA,Mr Zito or his legal representatives on this matter.,111
NA,(2) Yes. Telstra has advised that under the,111
NA,"provisions of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Com-",111
NA,"pensation Act 1988 (SRC Act), it accepted liability",111
NA,for Mr Zito's condition. Telstra continues to make,111
NA,compensation payments for medical and like,111
NA,expenses.,111
NA,"Telstra has also advised that, under Section 24",111
NA,"of the SRC Act, there is no provision for a lump",111
NA,sum permanent impairment payment to be paid to,111
NA,"Mr Zito. Telstra, as a licence holder under the SRC",111
NA,"Act 1988, has no alternative but to comply with the",111
NA,provisions of the Act.,111
NA,Telstra has further advised that it will not make,111
NA,an ex gratia payment to Mr Zito because Telstra,111
NA,considers such a payment would be in breach of its,111
NA,obligations under the SRC Act and its conditions,111
NA,of licence.,111
NA,(3) Telstra is responsible for the day to day,111
NA,"running of its affairs, including compensation",111
NA,related matters and makes its own commercial and,111
NA,management decisions within the context of,111
NA,legislative requirements and Government policies.,111
NA,"Telstra has advised me that, Mr Zito is entitled",111
NA,to seek a hearing before the Federal Administrative,111
NA,Appeals Tribunal to review the decision of Telstra's,111
NA,Reconsideration Delegate that there was no entitle-,111
NA,ment under the SRC Act for Mr Zito to receive a,111
NA,lump sum payment.,111
NA,Given that there are formal avenues available to,111
NA,Mr Zito in this matter there is no basis for me to,111
NA,intervene on Mr Zito's behalf.,111
NA,Tweed Valley Fruit Processors:,111
NA,Enterprise Agreement,111
NA,(Question No. 2670),111
NA,Mr Bradford asked the Minister for Indus-,111
NA,"trial Relations, upon notice, on 28 September",111
NA,1995:,111
NA,Is the Government objecting to the enterprise,111
NA,agreement involving forgone entitlements to sick,111
NA,leave in return for increased wages which 29,111
NA,employees of Tweed Valley Fruit Processors,111
NA,"entered into after protracted negotiations; if so,",111
NA,why.,111
Mr BRERETON ,The answer to the honour-,112
NA,able member's question is as follows:,112
NA,Yes. The Commonwealth intervened in an appeal,112
NA,"by the Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering,",112
NA,Printing and Kindred Industries Union against the,112
NA,approval of the implementation of an enterprise,112
NA,flexibility agreement (EFA) at Tweed Valley Fruit,112
NA,Processors Pty Ltd on the grounds that the Com-,112
NA,"missioner at first instance failed to apply the ""no",112
NA,"disadvantage"" test correctly.",112
NA,A Full Bench of the Australian Industrial Rela-,112
NA,tions Commission quashed the approval of the EFA,112
NA,on 26 October. In doing so it agreed with the,112
NA,Commonwealth submissions that the Commissioner,112
NA,"at first instance incorrectly applied the ""no disad-",112
NA,"vantage"" test. The Full Bench noted that the",112
NA,Commissioner erred in finding that the approval of,112
NA,the EFA would not result in a reduction in any,112
NA,entitlements or protections. In addition to paid sick,112
NA,"leave, the Full Bench identified a large number of",112
NA,reductions in award entitlements. These included,112
NA,"changes to bereavement and jury service leave,",112
NA,"overtime rates, annual leave loading, meal breaks,",112
NA,"hours of work, wages for junior employees, public",112
NA,holidays and redundancy pay.,112
NA,Of particular concern to the Commonwealth was,112
NA,the provision in the agreement which allowed for,112
NA,the prospective cashing out of sick leave. The Full,112
NA,"Bench decided, consistent with Commonwealth",112
NA,"submissions that whilst it is possible under the ""no",112
NA,"disadvantage"" test to trade off award entitlements",112
NA,"as part of an overall package, the public interest",112
NA,element of the test was intended to protect well,112
NA,"established and accepted community standards,",112
NA,such as sick leave.,112
NA,Kamppi Constructions Pty Ltd,112
NA,(Question No. 2692),112
NA,Mr Moore asked the Minister for Housing,112
NA,"and Regional Development, upon notice, on",112
NA,18 October 1995:,112
NA,Did the Minister's Department or its agencies,112
NA,make payments to Kamppi Constructions Pty Ltd,112
NA,(ACN 008 600 628) in any year between 1984-85,112
NA,"and 1994-95; if so, (a) what sum was paid in each",112
NA,year and (b) for what purposes was it paid.,112
Mr HOWE ,The answer to the honourable,112
NA,member's question is as follows:,112
NA,The information you have sought prior to 1988-,112
NA,89 is not available as portfolio expenditure records,112
NA,"have been destroyed, as permitted under the",112
NA,Archives Act 1983.,112
NA,No payments were made to Kamppi Construc-,112

NA,(Question No. 2705),112
NA,Mr Moore asked the Minister for Human,112
NA,"Services and Health, upon notice, on 18",112
NA,October 1995:,112
NA,(1) Did the Minister's Department or its agencies,112
NA,make payments to Kamppi Constructions Pty Ltd,112
NA,(ACN 008 600 628) in any year between 1984-85,112
NA,"and 1994-95; if so, (a) what sum was paid in each",112
NA,year and (b) for what purposes was it paid.,112
Dr LAWRENCE ,The answer to the honour-,112
NA,able member's question is as follows:,112
NA,The information you have sought for before,112
NA,1988-89 is not available as portfolio expenditure,112
NA,"records have been destroyed, as permitted under the",112
NA,Archives Act 1983.,112
NA,In respect of the years 1988-89 to 1994-95 there,112
NA,is no record of any payments being made by my,112
NA,Department or its agencies to Kamppi Construc-,112
NA,tions Pty Ltd.,112
NA,Kamppi Constructions Pty Ltd,112
NA,(Question No. 2707),112
NA,Mr Moore asked the Minister for Veterans',112
NA,"Affairs, upon notice, on 18 October 1995:",112
NA,Did the Minister's Department or its agencies,112
NA,make payments to Kamppi Constructions Pty Ltd,112
NA,(ACN 008 600 628) in any year between 1984-85,112
NA,"and 1994-95; if so, (a) what sum was paid in each",112
NA,year and (b) for what purposes was it paid.,112
NA,Mr Sciacca-The answer to the honourable,112
NA,member's question is as follows:,112
NA,No payment was made to Kamppi Constructions,112
NA,Pty Ltd between 1989-90 and 1994-95.,112
NA,The information you sought for 1988-89 and,112

NA,Mines: Production and Export,112
NA,(Question No. 2713),112
NA,Mr Cleary asked the Minister representing,112
NA,"the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 18",112
NA,October 1995:,112
NA,Does Australia produce and export mines and,112
NA,"mine components; if so,",112
NA,"(a) to which countries are mines exported,",112
NA,(b) in what quantities are they exported and,112
NA,(c) what part does the Minister's Department,112
NA,play in the trade.,112
NA,NA,113
NA,member's question is as follows:,113
NA,Australia does not manufacture or export land-,113
NA,mines and there are no records of the export of,113
NA,landmines from Australia. Landmines can be made,113
NA,from a wide variety of common materials like steel,113
NA,"or plastic, and may incorporate components like",113
NA,detonator> and explosives with both military and,113
NA,non-military application. Australian exports of,113
NA,military detonators and explosives are controlled,113
NA,under Regulation 13B of the Customs (Prohibited,113
NA,Exports) Regulations.,113
NA,This Government is committed to the elimination,113
NA,of all anti-personnel landmines as an ultimate goal.,113
NA,"However, in the absence of widespread internation-",113
NA,al support for a total ban as evidenced at the,113
NA,Inhumane Weapons Convention Review Conference,113
NA,held in Vienna from 25 September to 12 October,113
NA,"1995, the Government is advancing a number of",113
NA,"other proposals, which include tight restrictions on",113
NA,international transfers of mines and a complete,113
NA,moratorium on the export of the long-lived anti-,113
NA,personnel landmines that are killing and maiming,113
NA,civilians today.,113
NA,Senior High Schools,113
NA,(Question No. 2715),113
NA,NA,113
NA,"Vocational Education and Training, upon",113
NA,"notice, on 19 October 1995:",113
NA,(1) Has his attention been drawn to the success,113
NA,"of senior high schools throughout Australia, in",113
NA,particular in New South Wales.,113
NA,(2) Does the Commonwealth recognise the role,113
NA,of senior high schools in providing a halfway house,113
NA,between the discipline of high schools and the,113
NA,freedom of universities and T AFE.,113
NA,(3) Do senior high schools provide greater,113
NA,subject choice and diversity for students than Year,113
NA,"7-12 high schools; if so, to what extent is greater",113
NA,choice advantageous to students.,113
NA,Mr Free-The answer to the honourable,113
NA,member's question is as follows:,113
NA,(1) Yes.,113
NA,(2) While the Commonwealth has an important,113
NA,role in identifying national priorities and strategies,113
NA,"for schooling, the Statesrrerritories and non-",113
NA,government school authorities are in the best,113
NA,position to determine the most appropriate structure,113
NA,for upper secondary schooling in their jurisdiction.,113
NA,"In many States, this comprises a number of options",113
NA,including senior high schools. Providing options for,113
NA,senior students would contribute to higher Year 12,113
NA,retention rates.,113
NA,"(3) A study, 'Subject Choice in Years 11 and",113
NA,"12', conducted by the Australian Council for",113
NA,Educational Research in 1993 indicated that there,113
NA,was an association between the number of students,113
NA,in Year II & 12 and the extent to which students,113
NA,were able to study the subjects which they wished.,113
NA,"In particular, the study found that larger schools",113
NA,provided a wider choice of subjects for students.,113
NA,"However, the data also suggested that most schools",113
NA,(except for the very small) provided coverage,113
NA,across all Key Learning Areas.,113
NA,Private Schools: Funding,113
NA,(Question No. 2716),113
NA,NA,113
NA,"Vocational Education and Training, upon",113
NA,"notice, on 19 October, 1995:",113
NA,(1) Does the Commonwealth provide capital and,113
NA,recurrent funding to private schools dependent upon,113
NA,annual funding from other sources.,113
NA,(2) Has his attention been drawn to major,113
NA,changes proposed for John Paul II Senior High,113
NA,"School at Marayong, NSW.",113
NA,(3) Is the Commonwealth consulted about major,113
NA,changes to schools similar to those referred to in,113
NA,part (2).,113
NA,(4) Has his Department been consulted about the,113
NA,changes referred in part (2).,113
NA,(5) Is it a condition of the provision of Common-,113
NA,wealth funding to private schools that parents and,113
NA,"students be consulted about major changes: if not,",113
NA,why not.,113
NA,Mr Free-The answer to the honourable,113
NA,member's question is as follows:,113
NA,(1) The Commonwealth does provide capital and,113
NA,recurrent funding for non-government schools. For,113
NA,"more than 70 per cent of non-government schools,",113
NA,the Commonwealth is the major source of recurrent,113
NA,funding.,113
NA,(2) and (4) The New South Wales Catholic,113
NA,education authorities have notified the Department,113
NA,"of Employment, Education and Training under the",113
NA,Commonwealth's New Schools Policy of a possible,113
NA,restructuring of secondary schools within the,113
NA,Diocese of Parramatta to take effect from 1998.,113
NA,Notifications for 1998 were required by 31 October,113
NA,"1995. However, formal applications are not re-",113
NA,quired until February 1996 and no application has,113
NA,been lodged at this time in respect of the notifica-,113
NA,tion.,113
NA,(3) The approved authorities for all non-govern-,113
NA,ment schools in receipt of Commonwealth funding,113
NA,are required to give advance notification to the,113
NA,Commonwealth and later lodge a formal application,113
NA,for funding of changes such as extension to another,113
NA,"level of education, relocation to a new site and",113
NA,opening a new campus. Such changes are assessed,113
NA,for funding eligibility. Changes such as amalgama-,113
NA,tion with another funded school or separation to,114
NA,form two schools are also required to be notified,114
NA,but they are generally not the subject of a formal,114
NA,application nor assessed for funding. The assess-,114
NA,ment for eligibility for Commonwealth recurrent,114
NA,funding of non-government schools proposing to,114
NA,undertake changes looks at matters such as the,114
NA,demographics of the catchment area and the likely,114
NA,impact of the change on existing schools in the,114
NA,catchment area.,114
NA,(5) The Commonwealth is not involved with the,114
NA,internal management of schools so consultation,114
NA,with parents and students is not a specific,114
NA,ment. It is unlikely however that,114
NA,ges could be successfully implemented without the,114
NA,support of the school community.,114

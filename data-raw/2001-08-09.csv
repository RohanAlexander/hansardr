NA,WOOL INTERNATIONAL,5
NA,AMENDMENT BILL 2001,5
NA,First Reading,5
NA,"Bill presented by Mr Truss, and read a first",5
NA,time.,5
NA,Second Reading,5
Mr TRUSS ,Wide Bay-Minister for Ag-,5
NA,"riculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (9.47",5
NA,a.m.)-I move:,5
NA,That the bill be now read a second time.,5
NA,The Wool International Amendment Bill,6
NA,2001 will expedite the final stage in the dec-,6
NA,ade-long task of selling down the wool,6
NA,"stockpile, winding up the company charged",6
NA,with its management and will maximise the,6
NA,surplus equity returned to its shareholders.,6
NA,The legislation to privatise Wool Interna-,6
NA,tional in 1999 provided for the final distribu-,6
NA,tion to shareholders to follow the preparation,6
NA,of the final financial year audited accounts,6
NA,for WoolStock Australia Ltd.,6
NA,The board of WoolStock Australia has ad-,6
NA,vised the government that the last wool in,6
NA,the stockpile is likely be sold down in the,6
NA,"very near future, possibly in the next few",6
NA,days.,6
NA,This amendment will enable WoolStock,6
NA,Australia to bring forward its winding up and,6
NA,"final cash distribution to shareholders, with-",6
NA,out requiring the conclusion of these proc-,6
NA,esses to be after 30 June 2002. The share-,6
NA,holders of WoolStock are essentially those,6
NA,wool growers that met much of the burden of,6
NA,the debt associated with the stockpile in the,6
NA,very difficult years for the wool industry,6
NA,between 1993-94 and 1995-96.,6
NA,The effect of this amendment is that wool,6
NA,growers will get their final payment flowing,6
NA,from their shareholding considerably earlier,6
NA,than would be possible under the current,6
NA,"legislation, and, because the overhead costs",6
NA,of maintaining the company until after 30,6
NA,"June 2002 can be reduced, there will be cost",6
NA,savings which will maximise the surplus eq-,6
NA,uity to be returned to shareholders.,6
NA,The timely fashion in which the stockpile,6
NA,has been sold down since WoolStock Aus-,6
NA,tralia took over its management is a very,6
NA,strong reflection on the success of the Wool,6
NA,International privatisation. It is also a,6
NA,tion of the excellent job WoolStock Australia,6
NA,has done over the past two years.,6
NA,I thank Mr Donald MCGauchie and the,6
NA,members of the WoolStock board for their,6
NA,important role in selling down the stockpile.,6
NA,Shareholders have already received two,6
NA,"payments, with a third distribution expected",6
NA,in coming months. They will reap further,6
NA,benefits of this excellent work when they,6
NA,receive their final distribution payment after,6
NA,the remaining wool is sold and the necessary,6
NA,procedures taken to determine the surplus,6
NA,equity in WoolStock.,6
NA,This is indeed historic legislation. It may,6
NA,"be only a tiny bill, but it brings to an end an",6
NA,extraordinary chapter in Australian primary,6
NA,"production history. It will mean that, for the",6
NA,"first time in decades, Australian wool will be",6
NA,sold freely and fairly in the marketplace,6
NA,without having to labour under the heavy,6
NA,cloud of a stockpile overshadowing the mar-,6
NA,"ket. This bill, I think, marks the beginning of",6
NA,a new era for the wool industry. I commend,6
NA,"the bill to the House, and I present the ex-",6
NA,planatory memorandum.,6

NA,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,6
NA,AMENDMENT (MINIMUM,6
NA,ENTITLEMENTS FOR VICTORIAN,6
NA,WORKERS) BILL 2001,6
NA,First Reading,6
NA,"Bill presented by Mr Abbott, and read a",6
NA,first time.,6
NA,Second Reading,6
Mr ABBOTT ,Warringah-Minister for,6
NA,"Employment, Workplace Relations and",6
NA,Small Business) (9.51 a.m.)-I move:,6
NA,That the bill be now read a second time.,6
NA,This bill will amend the Workplace Rela-,6
NA,tions Act 1996 to enhance the legislated,6
NA,safety net entitlements in schedule 1A for,6
NA,employees in Victoria not covered by federal,6
NA,awards or agreements. The bill will make,6
NA,consequential improvements to the statutory,6
NA,role of inspectors under the federal act to,6
NA,"inform, investigate and if necessary enforce",6
NA,rights and obligations in schedule 1A work-,6
NA,places. It will also confer upon the Victorian,6
NA,reflecgovernment automatic intervention rights,6
NA,before the Australian Industrial Relations,6
NA,"Commission in specific circumstances, and",6
NA,"give contract outworkers in the textile,",6
NA,clothing and footwear industry in Victoria,6
NA,access to enforceable minimum rates of pay.,6
NA,The bulk of these measures to improve the,6
NA,safety net entitlements for Victorian workers,6
NA,are those the government proposed in sched-,6
NA,ule 15 of the Workplace Relations Legisla-,6
NA,"tion Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay)",6
NA,Bill 1999. That bill has stalled in the Senate,6
NA,"for almost two years, and the Australian",7
NA,Democrats have since called for issue-,7
NA,specific consideration of policy matters.,7
NA,"Taking this sentiment into account, the gov-",7
NA,ernment has since proceeded with a number,7
NA,of issue-by-issue workplace relations bills.,7
NA,This bill dealing with Victorian workers un-,7
NA,der schedule 1A continues that approach. It,7
NA,is supplemented by a number of additional,7
NA,measures which I announced on behalf of the,7
NA,federal government in March this year.,7
NA,Victorian employees not covered by a fed-,7
NA,eral award or federal agreement are presently,7
NA,covered by a legislated safety net of mini-,7
NA,mum conditions contained in part XV and,7
NA,"schedule 1A of the Workplace Relations Act,",7
NA,together with general statutory provisions,7
NA,applying to employees under the act such as,7
NA,access to unfair and unlawful termination of,7
NA,"employment remedies, equal pay for work of",7
NA,"equal value, non-discrimination provisions,",7
NA,workplace bargaining provisions and rights,7
NA,in respect of freedom of association. In addi-,7
NA,"tion, employees under schedule 1A are eligi-",7
NA,ble to be regulated by federal awards made,7
NA,by order of the Australian Industrial Rela-,7
NA,tions Commission (following relevant dis-,7
NA,"pute findings being made), or by certified",7
NA,"agreements or, in many cases, Australian",7
NA,Workplace Agreements.,7
NA,The minimum employment conditions,7
NA,presently legislated for in schedule 1A are,7
NA,largely a continuation of the safety net provithe,7
NA,sions that applied to these employees under,7
NA,Victorian state law immediately prior to the,7
NA,1996 referral by the state of a range of in-,7
NA,dustrial relations powers to the Common-,7
NA,wealth. That referral has been of substantial,7
NA,benefit to Victorian employers and employ-,7
NA,"ees, establishing for the first time a single",7
NA,framework of laws regulating industrial,7
NA,matters in Australia's second largest state.,7
NA,Since the introduction of the federal gov-,7
NA,"ernment's More Jobs, Better Pay bill meas-",7
NA,"ures in 1999, the current Victorian govern-",7
NA,ment has argued in-principle support for a,7
NA,"unitary regulatory system under federal laws,",7
NA,but claimed that the Commonwealth's,7
NA,schedule 1A proposals are inadequate. Dis-,7
NA,cussions between the Commonwealth and,7
NA,Victorian governments were halted in April,7
NA,2000 when the Victorian government unilat-,7
NA,erally announced its intention to establish a,7
NA,state task force inquiry. In October 2000 it,7
NA,subsequently introduced into its state parlia-,7
NA,"ment, again without notice to or consultation",7
NA,"with the Commonwealth, its Fair Employ-",7
NA,ment Bill 2000. That bill was ultimately re-,7
NA,jected by the Victorian upper house on 22,7
NA,"March 2001, although the Victorian govern-",7
NA,ment has threatened to reintroduce it into the,7
NA,parliament.,7
NA,The Fair Employment Bill was flawed in,7
NA,both concept and content. The re-creation of,7
NA,a second layer of industrial regulation in the,7
NA,form of a state industrial system would have,7
NA,"been regressive move, not in the interests of",7
NA,"employers or employees, nor the public in-",7
NA,"terest. A new system of state industrial laws,",7
NA,"regulations, tribunals and bureaucracy would",7
NA,have come at a significant cost to Victorian,7
NA,workplaces and the Victorian taxpayer. In,7
NA,"addition, the proposed Victorian system of",7
NA,industrial regulation would have signifi-,7
NA,cantly increased the cost of employment in,7
NA,"schedule 1A workplaces, and threatened jobs",7
NA,in urban and regional areas of the state.,7
NA,"Remarkably, even the proponents of the",7
NA,Fair Employment Bill-primarily the Victo-,7
NA,rian government and the Trades Hall Coun-,7
NA,"cil-estimated 1,900 job losses would follow",7
NA,"its introduction, as well as an increase in",7
NA,casual employment at the expense of existing,7
NA,permanent employment. Research based on,7
NA,full operation of the proposed new state,7
NA,system by consultants ACIL and Econtech,7
NA,for the Victorian Employers Chamber of,7
NA,Commerce and Industry estimated job losses,7
NA,"of 40,000 over three years.",7
NA,This Commonwealth bill is designed to,7
NA,"achieve dual objectives, both of which over-",7
NA,come the flawed approach of the Victorian,7
NA,government. The Commonwealth bill en-,7
NA,"hances, in a sensible way, the legislated",7
NA,safety net of minimum conditions of sched-,7
NA,ule 1A employees (without negatively im-,7
NA,"pacting on employment), and does so within",7
NA,the framework of a unitary system.,7
NA,The policy measures contained in this bill,7
NA,are the amendments first proposed in sched-,7
NA,"ule 15 of the government's More Jobs, Better",7
NA,"Pay bill, supplemented by the additional",7
NA,measures which I announced on 14 March,7
NA,2001.,7
NA,"In summary, the amendments would:",8
NA,- clarify the operation of the schedule 1A,8
NA,minimum entitlements to annual leave,8
NA,and sick leave (sick leave being incorpocess,8
NA,rated into carer's leave) by providing a,8
NA,basis upon which these leave entitle-,8
NA,"ments are to be calculated, and setting",8
NA,"out rules about access to, and accumula-",8
NA,"tion of, such leave;",8
NA,- give schedule 1A employees a statutory,8
NA,entitlement to be paid for work per-,8
NA,formed in excess of 38 hours a week;,8
NA,- provide federal inspectors with the,8
NA,power to enter and inspect premises,8
NA,where they reasonably believe that,8
NA,schedule 1A work is being performed;,8

NA,conditions of employment in schedule,8
NA,1A can be enforced in the same way as,8

NA,entitlement to stand down a schedule 1A,8

NA,leave for schedule 1A employees; and,8
NA,- create a legislative entitlement to be-,8
NA,reavement leave for schedule 1A em-,8
NA,ployees.,8
NA,"In relation to carer's leave, the bill",8
NA,poses to convert the current five-day sick,8
NA,leave entitlement in schedule 1A into a per-,8
NA,sonal leave minimum standard of eight days,8
NA,"per annum, which would be cumulative. Of",8
NA,"those eight days, up to five days per annum",8
NA,could be taken for caring purposes. In rela-,8
NA,"tion to bereavement leave, the bill proposes",8
NA,to amend schedule 1A to introduce a mini-,8
NA,mum standard of two days bereavement,8
NA,leave on the death of an immediate family,8
NA,member or household member. These,8
NA,amendments would provide a comparable,8
NA,minimum standard to carer's and bereave-,8
NA,ment leave as was proposed in the state bill.,8
NA,Victorian employees with disabilities who,8
NA,are not employed under a federal award or,8
NA,agreement do not currently have direct ac-,8
NA,to the supported wage system. At pres-,8
NA,ent such employees can only use section 509,8
NA,"of the Workplace Relations Act 1996, which",8
NA,allows the Australian Industrial Relations,8
NA,"Commission on a case by case basis, to issue",8
NA,an appropriate wages certificate for 12,8
NA,months duration. It would be preferable to,8
NA,give these employees direct access to the,8
NA,"supported wage system, which has been de-",8
NA,signed to meet the requirements of the Dis-,8
NA,"ability Discrimination Act 1992, and has the",8
NA,"support of peak disability groups, the Aus-",8
NA,tralian Chamber of Commerce and Industry,8
NA,and the Australian Council of Trade Unions.,8
NA,"Accordingly, the bill proposes to provide",8
NA,access to the supported wage system by,8
NA,amending part XV to give the commission,8
NA,power to determine that the supported wage,8
NA,system applies to schedule 1A employees,8
NA,within a work classification in a declared,8
NA,industry sector.,8
NA,The Victorian government has claimed,8
NA,that as a consequence of the Kennett gov-,8
NA,ernment's referral of powers the Victorian,8
NA,government does not have the ability to in-,8
NA,tervene in major industrial disputes which,8
NA,"occur within that state. In fact, all state gov-",8
NA,ernments have standing to seek leave to in-,8
NA,tervene before the Australian Industrial Re-,8
NA,lations Commission in cases where they have,8
NA,"a sufficient interest. However, in recognition",8
NA,of the specific circumstances of the Victorian,8
NA,government arising from the 1996 referral of,8
NA,"powers, the bill would amend the Workplace",8
NA,proRelations Act 1996 to give the Victorian,8
NA,government an automatic statutory right to,8
NA,intervene in proceedings involving an appli-,8
NA,cation under section 170MW of the act to,8
NA,suspend or terminate a bargaining period,8
NA,involving employees within the state of,8
NA,"Victoria, and in applications under section",8
NA,501 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to,8
NA,adjust minimum wages in industry sectors in,8
NA,that state.,8
NA,The bill also contains amendments to the,8
NA,Workplace Relations Act 1996 to improve,8
NA,the terms and conditions of home-based,8
NA,"outworkers working in the textile, clothing",8
NA,and footwear (TCF) industry in the state.,8
NA,The bill would introduce a requirement,9
NA,that contract outworkers in the TCF industry,9
NA,in Victoria receive at least the minimum,9
NA,schedule 1A rate of pay applicable to em-,9
NA,ployed TCF outworkers. The bill would also,9
NA,authorise federal workplace inspectors to,9
NA,enter premises where such work is per-,9
NA,formed and empower inspectors to enforce,9
NA,the minimum remuneration requirement and,9
NA,seek remedies in the courts on behalf of the,9
NA,outworker where non-payment or underpay-,9
NA,ment is identified.,9
NA,This statutory measure will complement,9
NA,"my announcement on 14 March that, fol-",9
NA,"lowing the passage of these amendments, a",9
NA,team of federal inspectors will commence,9
NA,compliance activities in the Victorian TCF,9
NA,industry in relation to these new outworker,9
NA,"entitlements, using the proposed new in-",9
NA,spectorate powers. I have also announced,9
NA,that a ministerial report on workplace rela-,9
NA,tions compliance in the industry will be pro-,9
NA,duced by the federal inspectorate three,9
NA,months following the commencement of,9
NA,these amendments. The suite of measures,9
NA,"contained in this bill will, when enacted, sigfacilitating",9
NA,nificantly improve the workplace relations,9
NA,framework in Victoria. It will unambigu-,9
NA,ously improve minimum conditions for em-,9
NA,ployees not covered by federal awards or,9
NA,agreements and for TCF outworkers. It will,9
NA,"do so in a responsible manner, retaining the",9
NA,benefits of existing employment under,9

NA,"Bill presented by Mr MCGauran, and",9
NA,read a first time.,9
NA,Second Reading,9
NA,Senator MCGAURAN (Victoria) (10.03,9
NA,a.m.)-I move:,9
NA,That the bill be now read a second time.,9
NA,The Trade Practices Amendment (Telecom-,9
NA,munications) Bill 2001 will streamline and,9
NA,make more efficient the telecommunications,9
NA,access regime in part XIC of the Trade Prac-,9
NA,tices Act 1974. The broad objective of the,9
NA,bill is to facilitate the timely resolution of,9
NA,telecommunications access disputes. The,9
NA,legislative measures in the bill are therefore,9
NA,designed to further encourage the negotiation,9
NA,of commercial outcomes and to speed up the,9
NA,regulatory arbitration process should com-,9
NA,mercial negotiations fail.,9
NA,This part of the Trade Practices Act gives,9
NA,telecommunications service providers a,9
NA,"statutory right of access, on reasonable terms",9
NA,"and conditions, to carriage and related serv-",9
NA,ices that have been declared by the Austra-,9
NA,lian Competition and Consumer Commis-,9
NA,"sion, the ACCC. It is the clear preference of",9
NA,this legislative scheme that parties resolve,9
NA,access disputes through commercial negotia-,9
NA,"tion. However, where commercial negotia-",9
NA,"tion is not successful, parties to an access",9
NA,dispute can notify the ACCC that a dispute,9
NA,exists and seek arbitration of the matter.,9
NA,The access regime delivers benefits to the,9
NA,economy and end users of telecommunica-,9
NA,"tions services by promoting competition,",9
NA,‘any to any' connectivity and en-,9
NA,"couraging the efficient use of, and invest-",9
NA,"ment in, infrastructure.",9
NA,"However, protracted delays in the arbitra-",9
NA,tion of access disputes are impeding compe-,9
NA,"tition in the telecommunications sector, and",9
NA,delaying lower cost and higher quality serv-,9
NA,ices to consumers. The Minister for Commu-,9
NA,"nications, Information Technology and the",9
NA,"Arts, Senator Alston, discussed possible",9
NA,measures to speed up access disputes and the,9
NA,timing of a reform package at an industry,9
NA,forum in May of this year. That forum re-,9
NA,flected a broad industry consensus about the,9
NA,need for immediate action to streamline the,9
NA,telecommunications access regime in order,9
NA,to provide certainty for critical investment by,9
NA,service providers and to promote the rapid,9
NA,development of broadband services.,9
NA,The legislative measures in this bill are,9
NA,about accelerating the process of resolving,9
NA,telecommunications access disputes and not,9
NA,about altering the outcomes of those dis-,9
NA,putes. The bill addresses each stage in the,9
NA,dispute resolution process under the access,9
NA,"regime. In particular, the amendments pro-",9
NA,posed to the ACCC arbitration process are,9
NA,consistent with the Productivity Commis-,10
NA,sion's draft report on telecommunications,10
NA,competition regulation.,10
NA,In the period before regulatory arbitration,10
NA,"by the ACCC, the amendments in this bill",10
NA,will encourage parties to resolve disputes,10
NA,without recourse to ACCC arbitration. In,10
NA,"particular, the ACCC will be required to",10
NA,publish pricing principles at the same time,10
NA,"as, or as soon as practicable after, the decla-",10
NA,"ration of services, and to publish results of",10
NA,arbitrations. This will increase the amount of,10
NA,relevant information to the market and fa-,10
NA,"cilitate commercial resolution of disputes,",10
NA,rather than lengthy arbitrations. Enabling the,10
NA,ACCC to ‘backdate' determinations to the,10
NA,date when commercial negotiations com-,10
NA,mence will also encourage parties to attempt,10
NA,"to resolve disputes commercially, rather than",10
NA,immediately notifying a dispute to the,10
NA,ACCC. In exercising its powers under the,10
NA,"telecommunications access regime, the",10
NA,ACCC will be required to have regard to the,10
NA,"objective of resolving disputes quickly, in-",10
NA,cluding through alternate dispute resolution,10
NA,(ADR) mechanisms such as mediation and,10
NA,conciliation.,10
NA,"To streamline the arbitration process itself, ices.",10
NA,the ACCC will be able to conduct multilat-,10
NA,eral arbitrations (to overcome the delays,10
NA,caused by separate hearings for common,10
NA,disputes) and to hear disputes with a single,10
NA,commissioner. Enabling the ACCC to dis-,10
NA,close information between common arbitra-,10
NA,tions will reduce the time taken in conduct-,10
NA,"ing individual arbitrations, while also en-",10
NA,couraging commercial resolution of disputes,10
NA,that have already been notified to the ACCC.,10
NA,The ACCC will also be able to make interim,10
NA,determinations over the objections of an ac-,10
NA,cess seeker and to prevent unilateral with-,10
NA,"drawal from arbitrations, thereby minimising",10
NA,the potential for delay and procedural abuse,10
NA,of the arbitration process.,10
NA,"If, following the ACCC process, an",10
NA,"ACCC determination is reviewed, the review",10
NA,"body, the Australian Competition Tribunal,",10
NA,will only be able to consider evidence avail-,10
NA,able at the original hearing. A further minor,10
NA,amendment would prevent a party from,10
NA,seeking a stay of an ACT-Australian Com-,10
NA,"petition Tribunal-decision, pending judicial",10
NA,"review, making this consistent with existing",10
NA,arrangements for ACCC determinations.,10
NA,This bill will streamline the current ar-,10
NA,rangements under which the industry oper-,10
NA,"ates. However it falls to access seekers, ac-",10
NA,cess providers and the ACCC to maximise,10
NA,the benefits of a competitive telecommuni-,10
NA,cations sector by properly utilising available,10
NA,"tools, both legislative and non-legislative.",10
NA,The government is encouraged by an in-,10
NA,creasing industry commitment to alternate,10
NA,dispute resolution and the ACCC's commit-,10
NA,ment to review its management of arbitration,10
NA,"processes, utilising the new legislative",10
NA,mechanisms.,10
NA,This bill does not preclude making further,10

Mr SNOWDON ,Northern Territory),11
NA,(10.12 a.m.)-The States Grants (Primary,11
NA,and Secondary Education Assistance),11
NA,Amendment Bill 2001 legislates a budget,11
NA,announcement described as ‘improving,11
NA,"schooling outcomes' which, while costed at",11
NA,"zero in the list of budget measures, claimed",11
NA,that $36.9 million was being provided over,11
NA,the period 2001-02 and 2003-04 for literacy,11
NA,and numeracy funding.,11
NA,I think that it is wise that we put to bed,11
NA,any perception that in this current financial,11
NA,"year and the two out years financial years,",11
NA,"until 2003-04, there are any additional mon-",11
NA,eys available for literacy and numeracy,11
NA,"funding. The shadow minister for education,",11
NA,"Michael Lee, said yesterday:",11
NA,Here we have a budget announcement claiming,11
NA,that $36 million extra is being provided to help,11
NA,"improve literacy in schools across the country, but",11
NA,it is only when you read the fine print that you,11
NA,find buried away at the back of Budget Paper No.,11
NA,"2, under the heading ‘Improving Schooling Out-",11
NA,"comes', we have how much additional expendi-",11
NA,ture in the year 2001-02? Zero dollars. How much,11
NA,in 2002-03? Zero dollars. How much in 2003-04?,11
NA,Zero dollars. How much in 2004-05? Zero dol-,11
NA,lars.,11
NA,I think that illustrates markedly the kind of,11
NA,mean and tricky way in which this govern-,11
NA,ment is addressing issues to do with educa-,11
NA,"tion, not only in the matter of school educa-",11
NA,tion but also for higher education. All areas,11
NA,of education have suffered as a result of the,11
NA,policies of this government.,11
NA,Here we have a government wanting the,11
NA,community to believe that over the next four,11
NA,"financial years, including the current one, an",11
NA,extra $36 million is going to be provided to,11
NA,"help improve literacy and numeracy, when",11
NA,that is clearly false. We do not have the min-,11
NA,"ister, the Prime Minister or anyone else asso-",11
NA,ciated with the government up on their feet,11
NA,in this House explaining to the Australian,11
NA,community why the government have sought,11
NA,"to mislead, misguide and basically act dis-",11
NA,honestly in relation to this funding.,11
NA,As a parent and as a citizen of this coun-,12
NA,"try, I would expect that when the government",12
NA,announces that literacy and numeracy stan-,12
NA,dards are a high priority and that they are,12
NA,allocating additional funding for this pro-,12
NA,gram-and when I am led to believe that that,12
NA,funding will be ongoing-I will see in the,12
NA,budget papers a decent dollar figure over the,12
NA,current financial year and into the out years,12
NA,"for this particular item. Yet, as has been il-",12
NA,"lustrated by the shadow minister, we have",12
NA,"nothing but an attempted act of, I think,",12
NA,grave dishonesty in the way in which this,12
NA,matter has been presented.,12
NA,We all acknowledge the importance of lit-,12
NA,"eracy and numeracy, and it is a pity that the",12
NA,"Minister for Employment, Workplace Rela-",12
NA,tions and Small Business is not in the cham-,12
NA,ber. I do have to declare an interest. I was a,12
NA,"schoolteacher, and my partner is a school",12
NA,teacher. I was Vice-President of the Northern,12
NA,"Territory Teachers Federation, as it then was.",12
NA,I was an active teacher-unionist and I was,12
NA,proud to be involved in the education profes-,12
NA,"sion. But what we now have is dishonesty,",12
NA,with attacks on public education by the gov-,12
NA,ernment and a failure to address the areas of,12
NA,greatest need and concern in the community,12
NA,in relation to numeracy and literacy.,12
NA,"I said I wanted to declare an interest,",12
NA,"did so for two reasons. Firstly, I am the par-",12
NA,"ent, with my partner, of four children, all of",12
NA,"whom attend schools; secondly, I am still a",12
NA,member of the education union and have an,12
NA,ongoing interest in what happens to educa-,12
NA,tion in general and public education in par-,12
NA,ticular. I am pleased to say that many of my,12
NA,"colleagues share that interest, particularly as",12
NA,it relates to public education. We know how,12
NA,this government has disparaged public edu-,12
NA,cation by seeking to divert taxpayers' funds,12
NA,to the wealthiest of Australia's private,12
NA,schools. The figures have been repeated of-,12
NA,"ten in this chamber, and it is not my intention",12
NA,"to repeat them again, other than to say that",12
NA,you do not have to be Einstein to work out,12
NA,that category 1 schools are currently getting,12
NA,"an extra $60 million, and there are 57 of",12
NA,"them. On average, that is a bit over $1 mil-",12
NA,lion each. But schools in the public sector,12
NA,"can expect to receive around $4,000 each",12
NA,from this process. Why is it that the govern-,12
NA,ment sees the importance of literacy and nu-,12
NA,meracy on the one hand but does not provide,12
NA,"funding in the out years, or even in the cur-",12
NA,"rent financial year, to address a particular",12
NA,"need. On the other hand, it is quite capable of",12
NA,shoving an additional amount of money in,12
NA,excess of $100 million into the pockets of,12
NA,the wealthiest of Australia's private schools,12
NA,over the funding period. This does not add,12
NA,up.,12
NA,I live in the Northern Territory and I see,12
NA,"the importance, on a daily basis, of ensuring",12
NA,"that there are adequate school facilities, ap-",12
NA,"propriate staffing arrangements, and that cur-",12
NA,riculum design and advice are ongoing. Of,12
NA,"course, this all requires money. In the North-",12
NA,ern Territory we have the highest proportion,12
NA,of students in public education of any Aus-,12
NA,tralian state or territory: 77.5 per cent com-,12
NA,pared with the national average of 69.7 per,12
NA,cent. That means public education for the,12
NA,Territory is more important overall than it is,12
NA,for other states and territories. It is particu-,12
NA,larly important in the case of the Northern,12
NA,"Territory because we have so many small,",12
NA,"remote communities and because we have, as",12
NA,well as the highest proportion of students in,12
NA,"the public education system, the lowest year",12
NA,"12 retention rates. On 1997 figures, 48.4 per",12
NA,and I cent of students in the Northern Territory,12
NA,"completed year 12 who are male, compared",12
NA,with the national average of 68.4 per cent-,12
NA,almost 50 per cent addition in terms of that,12
NA,"figure. Similarly, for females, the figure is",12
NA,57.8 per cent in the Northern Territory and,12
NA,79.5 per cent nationally. More alarmingly-,12
NA,and of greater concern-is the fact that in the,12
NA,"area of indigenous education, the picture is",12
NA,"extremely bleak, with year 12 retention rates",12
NA,at 9.4 per cent.,12
NA,I am not sure how this minister seeks to,12
NA,improve the outcomes in indigenous educa-,12
NA,tion without ensuring that the public educa-,12
NA,tion system is properly and appropriately,12
NA,funded. We hear often in this place about,12
NA,mutual obligation-that Australians must,12
NA,accept responsibility themselves in exchange,12
NA,for any commitment from government. It is,12
NA,pretty hard to take that approach when the,12
NA,educational attainment levels of many stu-,12
NA,dents in the Northern Territory are not ade-,12
NA,quate for them to gain entry into the labour,12
NA,market or into training programs that will get,13
NA,them into the labour market. That is a re-,13
NA,"sponsibility of government, yet we do not get",13
NA,even the slightest impression that the gov-,13
NA,ernment takes seriously the concern of the,13
NA,Australian community about the outrageous,13
NA,diversion of additional public moneys to the,13
NA,wealthiest private schools. Despite that con-,13
NA,"cern, this government has done nothing that",13
NA,has had any great impact on outcomes in,13
NA,"areas of numeracy and literacy, or on overall",13
NA,"education attainment levels, for students who",13
NA,live in the electorate of the Northern Terri-,13
NA,tory.,13
NA,I must say that it is not just the federal,13
NA,government's responsibility. It is with some,13
NA,concern that I note the report entitled,13
NA,Learning lessons: an independent review of,13
NA,indigenous education in the Northern Terri-,13
NA,"tory, by our former Senate colleague Bob",13
NA,"Collins, which has received some publicity",13
NA,in this place and in others. He makes it clear,13
NA,in this report that the Northern Territory gov-,13
NA,ernment levies the Commonwealth funding,13
NA,for the Indigenous Education Strategic Ini-,13
NA,"tiatives Program, which is used for salaries,",13
NA,at a rate of 46.1 per cent for on-costs. That,13
NA,an absolute scandal. In other states and juris-,13
NA,dictions the on-cost levy varies from four per,13
NA,"cent to 18.6 per cent, so it is impossible to",13
NA,justify the approach adopted by the Northern,13
NA,Territory government. This is a massive cost-,13
NA,shifting exercise. The Northern Territory,13
NA,government is creaming Commonwealth,13
NA,"resources, which are for targeted programs,",13
NA,to supplement its own budgetary framework.,13
NA,Over recent days there has been a great,13
NA,deal of debate in the Northern Territory,13
NA,"about education, primarily because there is",13
NA,currently a dispute between the Northern,13
NA,Territory Education Union and its employer.,13
NA,That dispute is derived from the union's con-,13
NA,cern about teachers' working conditions and,13
NA,the state of education in the Northern Terri-,13
NA,tory. There have been meetings of teachers,13
NA,already around the Northern Territory. I am,13
NA,told there will be a further meeting tomorrow,13
NA,to address concerns about professional de-,13
NA,"velopment, resources such as special needs",13
NA,teaching and reasonable limits on class sizes.,13
NA,I declared an interest earlier. I have,13
NA,"terest as a parent, but I also have an interest",13
NA,as a citizen of the Northern Territory that no,13
NA,child should be disadvantaged because of the,13
NA,short-sightedness and stupidity of the North-,13
NA,ern Territory government about education. It,13
NA,"has been in government since 1978, yet the",13
NA,educational attainment outcomes are appall-,13
NA,ing in the Northern Territory compared with,13
NA,the rest of Australia. The government has no,13
NA,reasonable answers as to why that is the case,13
NA,and why it has not done a great deal more,13
NA,about improving the lot of Territory students,13
NA,by providing them with the opportunity that,13
NA,they deserve to compete favourably with,13
NA,other students around Australia. The longer,13
NA,"we go on, the bigger the gap. That is the",13
NA,"problem. Despite the fact that teachers, who",13
NA,"are professional people, have expressed their",13
NA,"concern, the Northern Territory Chief Min-",13
NA,"ister-who, of course, is in the midst of an",13
NA,election campaign-has accused the Labor,13
NA,Party in today's Northern Territory News of,13
NA,conspiring with teachers to disrupt education,13
NA,in the Northern Territory in the lead-up to an,13
NA,election. You have to ask what planet he is,13
NA,on. Mr Burke alleges in this article:,13
NA,Members of the teachers and nurses unions were,13
NA,is pawns who were being used by the union leader-,13
NA,ship to heighten industrial action during an elec-,13
NA,tion campaign.,13
NA,That is an absolute insult. If the Chief Min-,13
NA,ister were at all serious about improving the,13
NA,"educational outcomes for all Territorians, he",13
NA,would take seriously the concerns being ex-,13
NA,pressed by the teaching profession. They are,13
NA,no more pawns of the Labor Party than he,13
NA,was of the Liberal Party when he was the,13
NA,officer commanding a cavalry regiment.,13
NA,"How can he allege, as he has done, that",13
NA,teachers in the Northern Territory have con-,13
NA,spired with the Labor Party to disrupt educa-,13
NA,tion services in the Northern Territory in the,13
NA,lead-up to an election? There is absolutely no,13
NA,evidence of that at all; yet he says it.,13
NA,He should be ashamed of himself and of,13
NA,his government. If he needs any reminding at,13
NA,all of why he should be ashamed of himself,13
NA,and his government-not because of what,13
NA,they have said about the teachers in this in-,13
NA,"stance, but because of their appalling record",13
NA,in the provision of educational services to all,13
NA,an inTerritorians-all he need read is Learning,13
NA,lessons. Then he should read his own gov-,13
NA,ernment's internal review from 1999 of,14
NA,"IESIP funding, which says that there has",14
NA,been a history of IESIP funding as substitute,14
NA,funding for the Northern Territory Depart-,14
NA,"ment of Education core business-game, set",14
NA,and match!,14
NA,The fact is that the Chief Minister of the,14
NA,Northern Territory needs to accept responsi-,14
NA,bility for the appalling state of educational,14
NA,"outcomes in the Northern Territory, particu-",14
NA,larly as they affect indigenous Territorians.,14
NA,"say to the Minister for Education, Training",14
NA,and Youth Affairs: instead of coming in here,14
NA,"trying to con the Australian community, own",14
NA,"up to your responsibility, just as the Chief",14
NA,Minister of the Northern Territory needs to,14
NA,own up to his. Instead of blackguarding,14
NA,"teachers and teacher unions, you should sup-",14
NA,port them in their desire to achieve better,14
NA,educational outcomes for all Australians.,14
Mr BILSON ,Dunkley) (10.32 a.m.)-I,14
NA,am pleased to rise today to support the States,14
NA,Grants (Primary and Secondary Education,14
NA,Assistance) Amendment Bill 2001. As other,14
NA,"speakers have highlighted, the bill is basi-",14
NA,cally about providing an additional $33.3,14
NA,million over the next three years towards,14
NA,improving literacy and numeracy out-,14
NA,comes-which naturally feed into educa-,14
NA,tional and learning outcomes-for educa-,14
NA,tionally disadvantaged students. The funding,14
NA,is in the form of strategic assistance to both,14
NA,government and non-government education,14
NA,authorities to support research programs and,14
NA,the implementation of projects to enhance,14
NA,what we understand about and how we ad-,14
NA,dress literacy and numeracy deficiencies.,14
NA,This funding gives effect to one of the,14
NA,resolutions from the meeting between Com-,14
NA,"monwealth, state and territory ministers for",14
NA,"education, who agreed to establish as a na-",14
NA,tional goal ‘that all students should have,14
NA,tained the skills of numeracy and English,14
NA,literacy such that every student should be,14
NA,"numerate, able to read, write, spell and",14
NA,communicate at an appropriate level.' That,14
NA,has been agreed as a national goal. Com-,14
NA,"monwealth, state and territory ministers with",14
NA,responsibility for education have agreed that,14
NA,"we as a nation should come together, work",14
NA,through the barriers that the federation often,14
NA,represents to sound public policy and move,14
NA,"forward together. There is a reason for that,",14
NA,and I note that reason has not been discussed,14
NA,a great deal by the Labor Party members,14
NA,who have spoken on this bill.,14
NA,"After 13 years of a Labor government,",14
NA,almost 30 per cent of kids in years 3 and 5,14
NA,could not read or write to an acceptable stan-,14
NA,dard. This is not some Third World country;,14
NA,this is Australia. This is a country with one,14
NA,of the highest standards of living in the,14
NA,"I world and, as the OECD has confirmed, one",14
NA,of the most rapidly and robust growing,14
NA,"economies in the world. So, surely, we could",14
NA,have our kids be able to read and write.,14
NA,Surely that is not too much to ask. But ap-,14
NA,"parently, after 13 years of a Labor govern-",14
NA,"ment, almost one-third of our kids in years 3",14
NA,and 5 could not do that. That was a national,14
NA,disgrace and a national tragedy.,14
NA,Since this government was elected in,14
NA,"1996, it has set about focusing on that clear",14
NA,"area of deficiency, recognising that, without",14
NA,"those core skills, without those basic capaci-",14
NA,"ties, trying to achieve higher educational",14
NA,outcomes is extraordinarily difficult. It is,14
NA,hard to get into an advanced discussion about,14
NA,physics or about career pathways that may,14
NA,"involve budgeting or something like that, if",14
NA,someone is not particularly numerate. It is,14
NA,difficult for someone with poor literacy skills,14
NA,to access the educational resources that are,14
NA,"available, whether it be online, in books, in",14
NA,technical references or in material that is,14
NA,circulated in the classroom. So there is a very,14
NA,clear connection between strengthening the,14
NA,performance of all students in these base,14
NA,areas of competency and those students be-,14
NA,ing able to move into more complicated ar-,14
NA,eas of education and skill development. That,14
NA,is the link.,14
NA,The bill before the House is not all that,14
NA,at- complicated; it simply corrects an error in,14
NA,the maths-and I hope that is not a reflection,14
NA,of a numeracy problem. It is actually an issue,14
NA,about forecasting the funds that are needed to,14
NA,support these programs. This bill sets out to,14
NA,correct that error. That is really what the bill,14
NA,is about. But I think the backdrop to the bill,14
NA,is of even more interest to the community I,14
NA,represent at Dunkley by the bay down on the,14
NA,Mornington Peninsula.,14
NA,This debate has been around for some,15
NA,"time, and it often gets entangled in the areas",15
NA,of school funding and whether government,15
NA,and non-government schools are better or,15
NA,worse. These are the areas that you see,15
NA,played out in the media as being the big,15
NA,points of discussion about education policy.,15
NA,"Even the previous speaker, the member for",15
NA,"the Northern Territory, spoke at length about",15
NA,his involvement in the education sector and,15
NA,about some argy-bargy that it is going on in,15
NA,the Northern Territory. That may interest,15
NA,"some in this House, but isn't this about the",15
NA,kids? Isn't it about developing their skills,15
NA,that we can achieve a situation in our coun-,15
NA,"try-because of the strength in our economy,",15
NA,our social fabric and our standard of living-,15
NA,where the opportunities and the pathways for,15
NA,"our young people into adulthood are as good,",15
NA,as rewarding and as rich and delicious as,15
NA,they can be? Isn't that really what this is,15
NA,about? And today we are discussing another,15
NA,measure that the government has put in place,15
NA,to make sure our kids have the necessary,15
NA,tools.,15
NA,The OECD is reported today as recognis-,15
NA,ing our country as the fastest growing in the,15
NA,developed world. That is a great credit.,15
NA,Don't we want our young people to be part,15
NA,of that? One of their passports to satisfying,15
NA,lifestyles and opportunities for fulfilment is,15
NA,to have the tools to contribute to that econ-,15
NA,omy and to participate in our community.,15
NA,That is what numeracy and literacy are,15
NA,about. It gets a little tiresome when we hear,15
NA,people arguing about other issues-for in-,15
NA,"stance, I refer to the atmospherics in the",15
NA,theatre of politics in the Northern Territory,15
NA,when the government was elected. Thirteen,15
NA,years of Labor gave us 30 per cent of young,15
NA,kids in years 3 and 5 being unable to read,15
NA,and write at an acceptable level. That is,15
NA,rageous in a country like ours.,15
NA,Dr Kemp has done a remarkable job in,15
NA,implementing a sound set of policies. History,15
NA,will look on his time as education minister as,15
NA,one of the most progressive and forward-,15
NA,looking eras of education policy in this,15
NA,country. Labor looked after only those who,15
NA,went on to university. As a former Labor,15
NA,"minister said, Labor was not interested in",15
NA,people who did not go to university. That,15
NA,reflected an attitude on the part of the Labor,15
NA,Party that education is only about going to,15
NA,university. It is not. Seventy per cent of,15
NA,"young Australians do not go on to university,",15
NA,and it is 80 per cent in the community that I,15
NA,represent. Surely we have a responsibility to,15
NA,"develop their capacity to be productive, en-",15
NA,"gaged, satisfied citizens. I emphasise that",15
NA,numeracy and literacy competency must be,15
NA,the building blocks of that. Shortly after Dr,15
NA,"Kemp was appointed education minister, he",15
NA,came across the statistics that the previous,15
NA,"education minister, Kim Beazley, now",15
NA,"so Leader of the Opposition, had hidden. Re-",15
NA,search had been going on for some time into,15
NA,"the literacy skills of many young Australians,",15
NA,and the Labor Party had that data but would,15
NA,not release it. It told nobody about the dis-,15
NA,graceful circumstance that the Labor gov-,15
NA,ernment presided over: that one-third of our,15
NA,kids in years 3 and 5 could not read and,15
NA,write properly. Dr Kemp flagged that literacy,15
NA,and numeracy would be the number one pri-,15
NA,ority of the Howard government.,15
NA,To develop those skills we opened new,15
NA,doors and new pathways for young people.,15
NA,Numeracy and literacy have remained central,15
NA,to the coalition's education policies because,15
NA,"they are important, for the reasons that I have",15
NA,explained. It is important to secure educa-,15
NA,tional opportunities and skill development,15
NA,prospects and to access programs that are,15
NA,available in that area. It is very much about,15
NA,people's ability to participate fully in our,15
NA,"modern society, to be productive citizens and",15
NA,to be engaged in our community. That is why,15
NA,the government's goal is that every student,15
NA,will achieve adequate literacy and numeracy,15
NA,skills by the end of primary school. Part of,15
NA,that commitment was the National Literacy,15
NA,"and Numeracy Plan, which has been agreed",15
NA,out- to by all states as an endorsement of the,15
NA,goals that the federal government has ar-,15
NA,ticulated and of the leadership that it has,15
NA,provided. A lot of state governments must,15
NA,have been asleep at the wheel at that time to,15
NA,have allowed 30 per cent of young people in,15
NA,years 3 and 5 to move through the school,15
NA,system without being properly skilled in nu-,15
NA,"meracy and literacy. In April 2000, as I have",15
NA,"mentioned, through Minister Kemp's advo-",15
NA,cacy and the federal government's leader-,15
NA,"ship, there is finally an agreement of ap-",15
NA,proved literacy and numeracy benchmarks,16
NA,"for years 3, 5, and 7. We now have some",16
NA,goals and targets. The agreed national meas-,16
NA,ures are a way of evaluating whether the bil-,16
NA,lions of dollars we invest in education are,16
NA,bringing about improvements in those skill,16
NA,areas.,16
NA,"The 1999 year 3 benchmark results, which",16
NA,were the first results under the national,16
NA,"benchmarks system, showed that on average",16
NA,86.9 per cent of year 7 students achieved the,16
NA,reading benchmark. What is most important,16
NA,about that figure is not the percentage who,16
NA,passed but the percentage who did not pass.,16
NA,We are reducing the proportion of students,16
NA,who are not achieving that level of perform-,16
NA,ance. That has been standardised across the,16
NA,"nation and it shows education authorities,",16
NA,ministers and jurisdictions what needs to be,16
NA,done in targeting resources where there is,16
NA,underperformance in numeracy and literacy.,16
NA,A good example of that was the result among,16
NA,indigenous kids. Whereas the general popu-,16
NA,"lation average is 86.9 per cent, indigenous",16
NA,kids scored significantly lower- 66.1 per,16
NA,cent. That reinforces the point that the mem-,16
NA,ber for the Northern Territory made. That,16
NA,evidence shows that there is a need for more,16
NA,work to be done. The whole point of the,16
NA,framework is to target assistance and to,16
NA,identify areas where skills are not being de-,16
NA,veloped to enable our citizens to be fully,16
NA,involved in our community. As a result of the,16
NA,"benchmarks, some action has followed. In-",16
NA,digenous literacy is funded under the Indige-,16
NA,nous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act,16
NA,2000. More money is directed into early days,16
NA,"and into early intervention, because from the",16
NA,benchmark we know that work needs to be,16
NA,done on that.,16
NA,You would think that the advantage of the,16
NA,benchmarking system would be pretty,16
NA,darned obvious. You would think that if you,16
NA,had that information you could identify,16
NA,where to put your education resources. All,16
NA,states and territories have agreed that that,16
NA,"helpful, and you would think that they have",16
NA,done that because it is patently obvious why,16
NA,"it is helpful. However, Victoria is the only",16
NA,"state where, rather than testing all students,",16
NA,we have a sample. For reasons that no-one,16
NA,"can quite understand, Minister Mary Dela-",16
NA,hunty does not want to test all Victorian,16
NA,schoolkids' literacy and numeracy standards.,16
NA,Why not test all the kids? Why not give the,16
NA,parents information about how the kids and,16
NA,their schools are going? Why doesn't the,16
NA,minister want that information herself so that,16
NA,the Victorian education department can,16
NA,identify school communities where nu-,16
NA,meracy and literacy are not the priority that,16
NA,they need to be and then take action to fix,16
NA,that? Surely that is helpful. What does Min-,16
NA,ister Mary Delahunty have to hide? Why will,16
NA,she not have all Victorian school children in,16
NA,"years 3, 5 and 7 tested against the national",16
NA,literacy and numeracy benchmarks? Why,16
NA,not? What is wrong with telling parents that,16
NA,this is the performance in our schools? Why,16
NA,is Victoria the only jurisdiction where that is,16
NA,happening? She refuses to test all year 7 stu-,16
NA,dents and opts for a sampling test as an alter-,16
NA,"native. Frankly, why do parents need to miss",16
NA,out on that information? Parents deserve and,16
NA,want to know whether their child can read,16
NA,and write at the national standards. A cult of,16
NA,secrecy seems to be important to the Minister,16
NA,for Education in Victoria. It bedevils state,16
NA,"education policy. It is like saying, ‘Don't tell",16
NA,"anybody.' It is like saying, ‘Don't speak",16
NA,about the war.',16
NA,Sometimes you have to talk about things,16
NA,"to move on. In this case, you should talk",16
NA,about the performance tests against these,16
NA,"national standards so that parents, school",16
NA,communities and the students can understand,16
NA,how they are going. Surely that is not too,16
NA,"much to ask. However, apparently in Victo-",16
NA,"ria, it is too much to ask. Perhaps she is fol-",16
NA,lowing Kim Beazley's lead when he was,16
NA,education minister. He had those scandalous,16
NA,figures showing that almost one-third of,16
NA,Australian schoolchildren were unable to,16
NA,read and write at an acceptable level. He had,16
NA,those figures when he was eduction minister,16
NA,and he kept them hidden.,16
NA,Is Minister Mary Delahunty in Victoria,16
NA,is following Kim Beazley's lead? I am not,16
NA,"quite sure about that, but it does open up an-",16
NA,other interesting story. We have heard from,16
NA,the Labor Party about their education policy.,16
NA,One of the hallmarks of that policy is to rip,16
NA,money off some school communities and,16
NA,redirect it to others. One of the areas Kim,16
NA,Beazley is talking about putting extra money,17
NA,into is school facilities. When he talks about,17
NA,"it, he doubles the amount. What you do not",17
NA,"hear, but what is in the fine print, is that",17
NA,Beazley's pledge to increase funding for,17
NA,school facilities in government schools relies,17
NA,upon state and territory governments match-,17
NA,ing whatever federal money Kim Beazley,17
NA,finds on his bankcard.,17
NA,That matching requirement is an interest-,17
NA,ing point. There was a near revolt right,17
NA,across Victorian school communities be-,17
NA,"cause, at a time when the Bracks government",17
NA,"had inherited a huge budget surplus, a treas-",17
NA,ure chest of resources to invest in public,17
NA,"works and community services in Victoria,",17
NA,the Bracks government came up with the,17
NA,"most pitiful, pathetic effort for school fund-",17
NA,ing. It came up with a microscopic increase,17
NA,"in funding. It was a funding increase which,",17
NA,when compared to what the Commonwealth,17
NA,"had done, was an embarrassment to the Vic-",17
NA,torian Labor government. So again a call was,17
NA,made to Minister Mary Delahunty by school,17
NA,communities across Australia: ‘Why are,17
NA,school communities missing out on extra,17
NA,resources when there is this huge budget sur-,17
NA,plus left behind by the Kennett government?',17
NA,"Mary Delahunty said, ‘Well, there's no more",17
NA,money for education in Victoria.',17
NA,The interesting test now is that Kim,17
NA,Beazley's education policy relies upon a,17
NA,Victorian state government matching this,17
NA,extra capital funding that Kim Beazley will,17
NA,whip off his bankcard. The test will be in,17
NA,Victoria. It will be interesting to see if,17
NA,"ister Mary Delahunty, who has told parents,",17
NA,students and school communities right across,17
NA,our great state that there is no extra money,17
NA,"for education, and that there is no extra",17
NA,"money for our kids in Victoria, finds extra",17
NA,money for Kim-for the Labor Party. Won't,17
NA,that tell us something? It will tell us that,17
NA,Beazley's education policy relies on the,17
NA,states matching additional funding for capital,17
NA,works in government schools. It relies on a,17
NA,state Labor government in Victoria matching,17
NA,whatever extra dollars Kim Beazley can,17
NA,whip off a bankcard.,17
NA,"There is no money for the kids, but will",17
NA,there be money for Kim? That is the question,17
NA,about education in Victoria and the Labor,17
NA,Party's policy. It will tell us something: was,17
NA,"Mary Delahunty telling the truth that, for",17
NA,whatever reason despite there being sur-,17
NA,Kim pluses of biblical proportions that they in-,17
NA,"herited off the Kennett government, there",17
NA,was no extra money or crumbs for the edu-,17
NA,"cation portfolio in Victoria, or will there be",17
NA,money for Kim? Won't that be an interesting,17
NA,test? Is she more interested in looking after,17
NA,the Labor Party and playing party politics-,17
NA,and Australians are tired of party politics-,17
NA,"cash for Kim, but no cash for the kids in our",17
NA,schools in Victoria? That will be an interest-,17
NA,"ing test. Whatever the outcome is, either",17
NA,Mary Delahunty was telling the truth and,17
NA,Kim Beazley's education policy is already a,17
NA,"fraud, or she was misleading the families and",17
NA,school communities in Victoria and she will,17
NA,find the money to match Kim's election,17
NA,"commitment-no cash for kids, cash for",17
NA,Kim. That will be an interesting test and we,17
NA,will get to see it shortly.,17
NA,This matters to me because I am a school,17
NA,council president at Monterey Secondary,17
NA,College in Frankston North. I work alongside,17
NA,"the parents, the school community, the",17
NA,teaching professionals and the leadership,17
NA,group at the school. They are a fantastic,17
NA,bunch of people who are working very hard,17
NA,to make the resources available to deliver the,17
NA,best educational opportunities for our kids in,17
NA,Dunkley by the bay in Frankston North. It,17
NA,will be an interesting test to see whether Kim,17
NA,Beazley's education policy will stand up af-,17
NA,"ter Mary Delahunty stood up to the students,",17
NA,Min- parents and school communities in Victoria.,17
NA,That highlights another great irony in the,17
NA,Labor Party's education policy. The Labor,17
NA,Party has moved an amendment to the States,17
NA,Grants (Primary and Secondary Education,17
NA,"Assistance) Amendment Bill 2001, arguing",17
NA,that the government is somehow using liter-,17
NA,Kim acy data for political advantage. That is code,17
NA,"for, ‘Gee, the Labor Party has been found",17
NA,out.' We have released the data which Kim,17
NA,Beazley sought to hide about one-third of our,17
NA,kids at years 3 and 5 not being able to read,17
NA,and write properly. We are fessing up to the,17
NA,"Australian community, and the Labor Party",17
NA,can only describe that as political advantage.,17
NA,So is highlighting their incompetence politi-,17
NA,"cal advantage? It may be, but that is not the",17
NA,point of this. This is just to make sure that,18
NA,we get the job fixed.,18
NA,The other interesting point is that they are,18
NA,talking about ripping money off non-,18
NA,"government schools, on the gross assumption",18
NA,that only wealthy people go to non-,18
NA,"government schools. Down my way, a lot of",18
NA,families have two jobs. One job pays for the,18
NA,education of their kids. That is a choice. The,18
NA,families have decided that that is the sort of,18
NA,commitment they want to make. They want,18
NA,to make that commitment to their kids and,18
NA,they are putting in a lot of work and earning,18
NA,an extra income just to be able to achieve,18
NA,"that. However, you would not know that if",18
NA,you listened to the Labor Party.,18
NA,In relation to the money that a future La-,18
NA,bor government-heaven forbid if one was,18
NA,ever elected- plan to rip off these non-,18
NA,"government schools, they have already said",18
NA,on their web site that they are going to send,18
NA,that money off to capital investments in pub-,18
NA,lic schools-and I have already highlighted,18
NA,how that is a bogus claim in Victoria-and,18
NA,provide some teaching scholarships and do,18
NA,some extra training for teachers. They do not,18
NA,mention anything at all on their web site,18
NA,about this funding rip-off from non-,18
NA,government schools going to literacy. How-,18
NA,"ever, in the amendment-guess what?-they",18
NA,have decided that they are going to spend the,18
NA,money on that as well. This is about phoney,18
NA,"figures and dodgy maths. All of a sudden,",18
NA,this money is going to have a literacy focus.,18
NA,They had better go back and update their,18
NA,web site.,18
NA,The great irony about this debate is that,18
NA,highlights the hypocrisy and internal incon-,18
NA,sistencies in the Labor Party's education,18
NA,policy. They talk about resources being made,18
NA,"available on the basis of need, yet when the",18
NA,government introduces a needs based policy,18
NA,"for funding non-government schools, the",18
NA,Labor Party oppose it. The old state aid de-,18
NA,bate is still resonating in the back corridors,18
NA,of the Labor Party faction machine. We,18
NA,thought we had passed that years ago. When,18
NA,the Labor Party talk out of the other side of,18
NA,their mouth they are saying that education is,18
NA,"a public good and we should get behind it,",18
NA,but somehow what comes through is this,18
NA,hatred of non-government schools when,18
NA,there are decent Australians just trying to,18
NA,make sure that their kids have the best possi-,18
NA,ble start in life. I support this bill and I over-,18
NA,whelmingly endorse Minister Kemp's efforts,18
NA,in the education portfolio. (Time expired),18
Mr MOSSFIELD ,Greenway) (10.52,18
NA,a.m.)-I rise to speak on the States Grants,18
NA,(Primary and Secondary Education Assis-,18
NA,tance) Amendment Bill 2001 and to support,18
NA,the amendment moved by the member for,18
NA,"Dobell. In considering this bill, I believe it is",18
NA,necessary to consider the broad education,18
NA,issues that we face today.,18
NA,The bill amends the States Grants (Pri-,18
NA,mary and Secondary Education Assistance),18
NA,Act 2000 to provide funding for literacy and,18
NA,numeracy programs for the years 2001-02,18
NA,"and 2002-03. If this were extra funding, it",18
NA,"would be clearly welcomed. However, it is",18
NA,not extra funding; it is funding that is basi-,18
NA,"cally being rebadged. In addition, in deliv-",18
NA,"ering literacy and numeracy programs, we",18
NA,need to have a high standard of facilities in,18
NA,"our schools, and that is an issue that I will",18
NA,address in my speech this morning. I would,18
NA,also like to refer to a part of the speech that,18
NA,the member for Dobell made yesterday in,18
NA,this particular debate where he highlighted,18
NA,that this is not extra funding but actually re-,18
NA,badged money. He said:,18
NA,The problem is that it is minimal extra funding; it,18
NA,is simply rebadging the old Disadvantaged,18
NA,Schools Program and rebadging the English as a,18
NA,Second Language Program- even wrapping up,18
NA,into it some of the special education program,18
NA,money-and claiming that that is going to do,18
NA,something about literacy. If the government wants,18
NA,it to really do something about improving literacy,18
NA,in Australian schools we need to make sure that,18
NA,we are targeting the extra funding into the schools,18
NA,that need the most help. That is why the Labor,18
NA,Party is proposing to establish education priority,18
NA,zones to put extra Commonwealth funding into,18
NA,schools that need the most help.,18
NA,Members would be aware that the Australian,18
NA,Primary Principals Association recently,18
NA,"commissioned a report entitled Our future, in",18
NA,which Max Angus and Harriet Olney of the,18
NA,"Edith Cowan University surveyed 2,452",18
NA,primary school principals and deputy princi-,18
NA,pals across the country to canvass their views,18
NA,on school resources and the future of public,18
NA,education. In an introductory letter sent to all,18
NA,"federal members, Tony Misich, the President",19
NA,of the Australian Primary Principals Asso-,19
NA,"ciation, states:",19
NA,Primary school principals have long been worried,19
NA,"about the increasing demands on schools, without",19
NA,receiving additional resources. Anecdotally and,19
NA,"individually, we have been worried that the pri-",19
NA,mary school dollar can stretch no further.,19
NA,He goes on to point out four main areas of,19
NA,concern. The first is resources. He states:,19
NA,Principals feared a number of negative conse-,19
NA,quences resulting from insufficient resources in,19
NA,government primary schools. They expressed a,19
NA,"clear need for an increase in a) funding, b)",19
NA,"ties, c) teaching and specialist staff.",19
NA,"I suggest that, when he talks about the need",19
NA,"for teaching and specialist staff, he is clearly",19
NA,referring to teachers who would be able to,19
NA,deliver these literacy and numeracy pro-,19
NA,grams that are so vital in our schools. He,19
NA,also names administrative support and proper,19
NA,leadership structures as other areas of re-,19
NA,source concern.,19
NA,The second point he makes is that 80 per,19
NA,cent of principals believe that their schools,19
NA,are underfunded in terms of what they are,19
NA,expected to achieve. The principals are often,19
NA,forced to take resources from one area of,19
NA,need in order to fund another area of need.,19
NA,The third point that Tony Misich makes is,19
NA,under the subheading ‘Policies and Ethos'.,19
NA,He states:,19
NA,The majority of principals attributed importance,19
NA,"to academic performance, the development of a",19
NA,"strong work ethic, conservation of the natural",19
NA,environment and respect for adults. Principals,19
NA,believe schools should reflect the values of the,19
NA,"wider community, not just those found in local",19
NA,communities.,19
NA,The most telling point in that letter is the,19
NA,fourth point under the subheading of ‘The,19
NA,Future'. The report unfortunately shows that,19
NA,‘government primary school principals are,19
NA,generally pessimistic about the context in,19
NA,"which schools will operate in the future',",19
NA,although he does point out that there is a de-,19
NA,gree of confidence in their capacity to main-,19
NA,tain standards regardless and a determination,19
NA,"to do so, and that almost half believe that",19
NA,government schools will continue to perform,19
NA,well.,19
NA,The Our future report runs to some 46,19
NA,"pages, which makes for some very interest-",19
NA,"ing reading. I will quote it later, but first I",19
NA,would like to say a few basic things about,19
NA,education in general. It is my belief that a,19
NA,strong and vibrant education system forms,19
NA,the foundation stone of a free and democratic,19
NA,"society, and any attack on public education is",19
NA,"an attack on democracy itself. Historically,",19
NA,"the call for, and the establishment of, public",19
NA,education went hand in hand with the devel-,19
NA,opment of a modern democratic state. Mass,19
NA,public education helped to end feudalism as,19
NA,facilia system of government. Nations that have,19
NA,no publicly provided education system do,19
NA,not prosper. Children are the future of our,19
NA,country and their education is fundamental to,19
NA,"that future. This is a cliche, of course, but it",19
NA,is a cliche simply because it is true and obvi-,19
NA,ous and it should go without saying. Unfor-,19
NA,"tunately, we have to say it because some",19
NA,people do not seem to believe it. Some peo-,19
NA,ple do not seem to believe in public educa-,19
NA,"tion; some see education as a privilege, not a",19
NA,right. They are wrong; they are very wrong.,19
NA,There are already too many barriers in our,19
NA,"society for many children. Wealth, geogra-",19
NA,"phy, the economic environment and technol-",19
NA,ogy are just a few. We should not and we,19
NA,cannot allow the lack of access to education,19
NA,to be one of these barriers. Public education,19
NA,is fundamental to the future of our nation; it,19
NA,is fundamental. As representatives of the,19
NA,"people, we have a very important role to",19
NA,"play. We are the keepers of the purse strings,",19
NA,and it is time to loosen these purse strings,19
NA,and provide an education system that will,19
NA,take us into the future.,19
NA,There is no point bickering over whose re-,19
NA,sponsibility it is-state or federal-to pro-,19
NA,vide for the education of our children. That,19
NA,time has passed. That is an old way of,19
NA,thinking; that is last century's way of think-,19
NA,ing. I would have thought that the end of the,19
NA,millennium and a century of federation,19
NA,would have focused our minds and our ideas,19
NA,"on the future. Unfortunately, this government",19
NA,"have been so wrapped up in the never, ever",19
NA,of tax changes and in implementing a 1960s,19
NA,French socialist tax that they have taken their,19
NA,eyes off the future and the fundamentals. We,19
NA,have been mired in a bog of everyday petty,19
NA,"politics as a result. The report, Our future,",20
NA,"gives us a chance to refocus, to examine the",20
NA,problems that exist in the system today and,20
NA,to work towards the type of change that is,20
NA,needed to bring public education into the,20
NA,21st century. There are problems; they have,20
NA,been identified and we should not be stand-,20
NA,ing around simply passing the buck: ‘It is not,20
NA,"our responsibility, it is the state govern-",20
NA,ments' responsibility.' Wrong again. It is eve-,20
NA,"rybody's responsibility. Parents, teachers,",20
NA,"students, community leaders, state govern-",20
NA,ments and federal governments-we all have,20
NA,a part to play.,20
NA,The recent launch of the Knowledge Na-,20
NA,tion task force report shows that Labor have,20
NA,"a plan for the future, a far-reaching and vi-",20
NA,"sionary plan, yet this government dismisses",20
NA,it out of hand. If they did not,20
NA,then it is not worthy of thought. Wrong,20
NA,again. The government's reaction to the,20
NA,launch of Knowledge Nation amply demon-,20
NA,strates the lack of vision this government,20
NA,have when it comes to education and educa-,20
NA,tional issues. They may have wound back the,20
NA,"despicable enrolment benchmark adjustment,",20
NA,but that cannot make up for all the money,20
NA,that has already been ripped out of the public,20
NA,education system of this country.,20
NA,"When we look at the history of our nation,",20
NA,we can point to a number of what have been,20
NA,"called nation building projects, such as the",20
NA,Snowy Mountains scheme. I would like fu-,20
NA,"ture generations to be able to look back, at",20
NA,"the turn of this century, and point to educa-",20
NA,tion as a great nation building project. What,20
NA,better form of nation building can there be,20
NA,than to build up our education system to,20
NA,where it is the best in the world? One hun-,20
NA,dred per cent of our future citizens will at-,20
NA,"tend primary schools, 70 per cent will attend",20
NA,government schools. Nation building is not,20
NA,easy. It requires a huge commitment of both,20
NA,money and resources. It requires a vision,20
NA,from our leaders and it requires hard work,20
NA,from the rest of us. Governing is about pri-,20
NA,"orities, and education needs to be placed at",20
NA,the top of the list. It is time to stop buck-,20
NA,passing. It is time to roll up our sleeves and,20
NA,get stuck into it. If we want to face the chal-,20
NA,lenges that are before us today with any de-,20
NA,"gree of confidence and skill, then we must",20
NA,invest in the education of our children. There,20
NA,"is no short-term financial return, no quick",20
NA,"stock market dollar, to be made from this.",20
NA,The payout will come many years down the,20
NA,track when our children have grown and,20
NA,taken their place in the new society that they,20
NA,will be building. That is why governments,20
NA,must be involved. This is not something for,20
NA,the private sector preoccupied with a quick,20
NA,return on their investment. This is in the,20
NA,realm of the public domain; it is the govern-,20
NA,ment's responsibility. That is why govern-,20
NA,ments exist-to provide services to the peo-,20
NA,"ple, to provide for the education of our",20
NA,young.,20
NA,I said I would return in more detail to the,20
NA,Our future report. I will start with some,20
NA,comments from the executive summary of,20
NA,"think of it first, that report:",20
NA,Literacy resources were a high priority for addi-,20
NA,tional funding. These included a wide range of,20
NA,"needs such as guided reading materials, storage",20
NA,"space, literacy expertise and increased staffing",20
NA,levels to allow for small and one to one instruc-,20
NA,"tions. The need for larger, more functional class-",20
NA,rooms were also linked to concerns about literacy,20
NA,standards.,20
NA,This is an area we have to get right. It is an,20
NA,area that requires constant revision and con-,20
NA,stant adaptation. Without literacy there is no,20
NA,education. The States Grants (Primary and,20
NA,Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000,20
NA,would go part of the way to addressing that,20
NA,"concern if, in fact, there were new money in",20
NA,the bill. We on this side of the House say that,20
NA,there is no new money. The report went on,20
NA,to say:,20
NA,The introduction of information communication,20
NA,technology into schools was identified as having,20
NA,significantly increased the recurrent cost of prime,20
NA,schools. The costs of establishing networks and,20
NA,maintaining and upgrading computer systems,20
NA,were cited as a common problem in schools.,20
NA,Technology was also seen as requiring additional,20
NA,expertise and increased staff time. It is a resource,20
NA,"that has great value as a learning tool, however.",20
NA,Budgets have simply not kept pace with the,20
NA,technological advances that have occurred in,20
NA,recent years. Inadequate resources in this,20
NA,area have led to a rapid increase in what is,20
NA,"now known as the digital divide, and it rep-",20
NA,resents one of those barriers I talked about,20
NA,earlier. The report also said:,20
NA,Pressure to provide curriculum breadth was,21
NA,linked to parental expectations and the introduc-,21
NA,tion of the eight key learning areas. Many princi-,21
NA,pals expressed concern that their schools were,21
NA,unable to provide music and physical education.,21
NA,"They said that schools need suitable areas, staff",21
NA,with specialist skills and higher staffing levels,21
NA,order to provide such programs.,21
NA,It is not enough to simply provide for read-,21
NA,"ing, writing and arithmetic. Education is",21
NA,"more than that, and we need to provide for",21
NA,more than just that. Limited resources re-,21
NA,"quire prioritisation and, when you prioritise,",21
NA,naturally some miss out. As the report,21
NA,"pointed out, some principals believed that the",21
NA,most needy students were receiving the help,21
NA,"they require. That is certainly a good, posi-",21
NA,tive point coming from the principals. How-,21
NA,"ever, the problem occurs when trying to re-",21
NA,source programs for those students in the,21
NA,"next level up of relative needs. This, of",21
NA,"course, is most unsatisfactory. It basically",21
NA,means there are insufficient funds in total,21
NA,and that the funds have to be directed to,21
NA,where the principals feel there is most need;,21
NA,but the report has suggested that the needs of,21
NA,the most needy are being met. Three-quarters,21
NA,of the principals were against policies based,21
NA,on competition theories and did not accept,21
NA,that schools should be penalised when par-,21
NA,"ents withdraw children, which happened un-",21
NA,der the enrolment benchmark adjustment.,21
NA,"Education cannot be based on competition,",21
NA,"because competition, by its very nature, pro-",21
NA,"duces winners and losers, and usually more",21
NA,losers than winners. Education must be uni-,21
NA,versal.,21
NA,While the majority of principals indicated,21
NA,"that their facilities were adequate, some 26",21
NA,per cent- more than a quarter-indicated,21
NA,that schools were badly in need of facility,21
NA,upgrades. This would again indicate a vast,21
NA,gap in the facilities of schools. Some obvi-,21
NA,"ously are fairly well equipped, and many are",21
NA,not. Some principals raised concerns about,21
NA,not being able to protect students from the,21
NA,"sun, wind, rain and, in some locations, even",21
NA,snow during physical education classes and,21
NA,school assemblies and when moving between,21
NA,buildings. I know from personal experience,21
NA,of visiting schools in my own electorate that,21
NA,this is a problem-not necessarily with snow,21
NA,but certainly with the other elements.,21
NA,I am also aware that many school com-,21
NA,munities themselves-parents and citizens-,21
NA,are raising the money for these facilities.,21
NA,This issue was raised in an article in the Syd-,21
NA,ney Morning Herald on 30 July when a sur-,21
NA,in vey conducted by the Sydney Morning Her-,21
NA,ald of P&C associations at 90 schools,21
NA,showed that parents are even paying for such,21
NA,"basic items as gas and electricity, which in",21
NA,fact are not fully funded by the state gov-,21
NA,ernment funding program. Funds raised by,21
NA,"individual P&Cs, according to this article,",21
NA,"ranged from $500 to more than $100,000,",21
NA,"with one school in my own electorate, Kings",21
NA,"Langley, raising some $60,000. In the Our",21
NA,"Future report, reliance on outside sources for",21
NA,funding was seen as a problem by 91 per,21
NA,cent of the respondents.,21
NA,While speaking about my electorate of,21
NA,Greenway in an adjournment debate in the,21
NA,"Main Committee on 29 March, I tabled a list",21
NA,of urgent maintenance items that schools in,21
NA,my electorate required. I said in tabling the,21
NA,list that schools were not asking for the,21
NA,world; they were simply asking for basic,21
NA,"items such as toilet and bubbler upgrades,",21
NA,"first aid/sick bay facilities, decent security",21
NA,systems and airconditioning. I pointed out,21
NA,"that, even if some of these schools received",21
NA,"airconditioning, they would have trouble",21
NA,"turning it on because, without an upgrade,",21
NA,the power system would blow.,21
NA,Last week I visited another very good,21
NA,"school in my electorate, Blacktown South",21
NA,"Public School, which has just under 700 stu-",21
NA,dents. The buildings are 40 years old and so,21
NA,"is the wiring, and airconditioning, though",21
NA,"desperately needed, would be virtually use-",21
NA,less because of the age of the power system.,21
NA,"It needs at least $35,000 to upgrade the wir-",21
NA,ing before it can even think about something,21
NA,"like airconditioning. In summer, the tem-",21
NA,peratures soar and the children and teachers,21
NA,"suffer, and they will continue to suffer until",21
NA,something is done to fix the problem. The,21
NA,school's classrooms have not been painted in,21
NA,24 years and the students' artworks can only,21
NA,go so far to cover up the paintwork. Black-,21
NA,town South is a typical school with dedicated,21
NA,staff achieving great results under severe,21
NA,"restrictions, and I think it is time that we as",21
NA,"governments, both state and federal, helped",22
NA,these types of schools.,22
NA,This bill will give $33 million to literacy,22
NA,and numeracy programs over the next two,22
NA,"years. If this is real funding, it is still",22
NA,drop in the ocean. In its submission to the,22
NA,New South Wales government for this year's,22
NA,"budget, the New South Wales Primary Prin-",22
NA,cipals Association identified the need for at,22
NA,least an extra $333 million to redress the ero-,22
NA,sion of funding in real terms and enable the,22
NA,essential programs that I have been referring,22
NA,to in this speech to continue-$333 million,22
NA,in New South Wales alone is what is needed,22
NA,to bring the system up to par. Add the other,22
NA,states into the mix and the figure is obvi-,22
NA,ously much higher.,22
NA,I welcome of course whatever money is in,22
NA,this budget for education. Any money put,22
NA,towards educational programs is welcome.,22
NA,"However, let us be serious. Compared to",22
NA,what is needed in the primary sector alone-,22
NA,let alone the secondary sector-this is noth-,22
NA,ing and we need to be talking about bigger,22
NA,issues than just what is represented here in,22
NA,this legislation. This bill represents no more,22
NA,than one step in a marathon race. There are,22
NA,"still another 42 kilometres to go, and the",22
NA,pack is moving away in the distance and we,22
NA,are in danger of falling back amongst the,22
NA,"stragglers, limping home after dark.",22
NA,"Finally, just returning to the Our Future",22
NA,"report for a moment, it is important to know",22
NA,"that, while it was commissioned by and fo-",22
NA,cused wholly on the government or public,22
NA,"sector, it was also supported by the private",22
NA,school principals as well. The Australian,22
NA,Primary Principals Association is made up of,22
NA,"both public and private schools, and that as-",22
NA,sociation strongly supports the report calling,22
NA,for more resources for public schools. It is,22
NA,time to stop the bickering and buck passing.,22
NA,It is time to put the federal-state divide be-,22
NA,hind us and look at education as a national,22
NA,priority; it is a chance for some truly monu-,22
NA,mental nation building. Only then will the,22
NA,"money come, and then the resources. Only",22
NA,then will we start to make progress towards,22
NA,the knowledge nation that we all can be and,22
NA,that we need to be.,22
Mr ACTING SPEAKER,The chair,22
NA,might say that it is very pleased that the,22
NA,member for Greenway's scaffolding did not,22
NA,collapse during the course of his speech.,22
Mr NEVILLE ,Hinkler) (11.12 a.m.)-,22
NA,The purpose of the States Grants (Primary,22
NA,only a and Secondary Education Assistance) Amend-,22
NA,ment Bill 2001 is to provide additional,22
NA,funding for literacy and numeracy programs,22
NA,for the years 2001-02 and 2002-03. I am,22
NA,proud to stand here today as a member of the,22
NA,"National Party, having been able to make a",22
NA,real difference in government to the lives of,22
NA,children at schools in my electorate. I say,22
NA,that quite sincerely. We are making ground,22
NA,"on numeracy and literacy, but the work is not",22
NA,"finished, and unfortunately there are negative",22
NA,and cynical forces trying to keep children,22
NA,and schools from Bundaberg to Gladstone in,22
NA,my electorate in the dark ages and their par-,22
NA,ents in the dark.,22
NA,"I visit a lot of schools in my work, and",22
NA,lately I have made visits to South Kolan,22
NA,"Primary School, Faith Baptist School, Mount",22
NA,"Morgan State High School, Mount Larcom",22
NA,secondary departments and St Stephen's,22
NA,"College. At the secondary schools, I pre-",22
NA,sented the Centenary of Federation book on,22
NA,Edmund Barton. I just hope that the state,22
NA,"Labor education minister, the Queensland",22
NA,Teachers Union and the federal ALP give,22
NA,those primary school students whom I visited,22
NA,a fighting chance to be able to read that book,22
NA,and that the secondary school children in the,22
NA,schools I visited will receive the remedial,22
NA,assistance with their reading if they require,22
NA,"it. The Labor state education minister, Anna",22
NA,"Bligh, is, quite frankly, hiding the truth about",22
NA,literacy standards from the parents of,22
NA,"schoolchildren in Bundaberg, Burnett, Isis,",22
NA,"the Coral Coast, Miriam Vale, Discovery",22
NA,Coast and Central Queensland.,22
NA,The report on literacy and numeracy stan-,22
NA,dards issued by the Queensland School Cur-,22
NA,riculum Council last week reveals that al-,22
NA,most 22 per cent of year 5 students in,22
NA,Queensland did not meet the national,22
NA,benchmark standards last year. That means,22
NA,"that one in five students or, if you like, six in",22
NA,every average class have fallen behind. Why,22
NA,aren't the QTU up in arms about that? I,22
NA,would have thought that that would have,22
NA,been a fundamental social issue in this de-,22
NA,bate on education. Minister Anna Bligh will,22
NA,not even tell the parents in the Hinkler elec-,23
NA,torate whether their children can read or,23
NA,write to the national standard levels for their,23
NA,"age groups. Instead, she voted with the other",23
NA,state Labor education ministers to reject the,23
NA,Commonwealth's proposal that the states,23
NA,should tell each parent how their child's,23
NA,"reading, writing, spelling and numeracy",23
NA,achievement compares with national literacy,23
NA,and numeracy benchmark standards. She will,23
NA,not tell them because the figures are not,23
NA,good and people might start questioning the,23
NA,"fact that, despite $5 billion in a GST windfall",23
NA,going to the Beattie government in this,23
NA,"year's budget, that government did not even",23
NA,match the federal government's education,23
NA,funding increase to state schools.,23
NA,A half-completed footbridge across the,23
NA,Brisbane River in Brisbane and a football,23
NA,stadium that few seem to want are amongst,23
NA,$700 million worth of unnecessary expendi-,23
NA,ture being used to build monuments in Bris-,23
NA,bane. These works seems to be more impor-,23
NA,tant to the Labor Party in Queensland than,23
NA,the school children in Bundaberg and,23
NA,Gladstone being able to read or write. It is,23
NA,very quick to criticise the federal govern-,23
NA,ment if we do not do something in the elec-,23
NA,"torate, but it is very slow to order its priorinised",23
NA,ties when it can build stadiums and foot-,23
NA,bridges at the expense of children receiving,23
NA,"basic education. Anna Bligh, along with",23
NA,"other state education ministers, then tried to",23
NA,put up a smokescreen by attacking the Na-,23
NA,tional Literacy and Numeracy Plan. I think,23
NA,that is just a taste of what parents in my,23
NA,electorate could expect if Labor were to be,23
NA,successful in the coming federal election.,23
NA,"Talk about roll-back, Labor wants to roll",23
NA,back the national benchmark tests because,23
NA,the teachers' unions oppose them-simply,23
NA,for that reason. The Queensland Teachers,23
NA,Union is running a purely political campaign,23
NA,"on behalf of the ALP, knowing that the ALP",23
NA,will dismantle the literacy and numeracy,23
NA,initiatives if elected.,23
NA,This government will never compromise,23
NA,on the education of Australian students by,23
NA,backing away from its literacy and numeracy,23
NA,"strategy, and I fully support the efforts of",23
NA,"Minister Kemp, who has visited my elector-",23
NA,ate on two occasions where this has been a,23
NA,"seminal issue. By contrast, Minister Anna",23
NA,Bligh's refusal to tell parents whether their,23
NA,children can read or write at national stan-,23
NA,dards shows that she thinks very little of the,23
NA,"parents, the P&Cs and the schoolchildren",23
NA,themselves. She obviously believes that lit-,23
NA,eracy and numeracy testing results are too,23
NA,"politically dangerous in the hands of parents,",23
NA,who quite rightly demand that their children,23
NA,are properly schooled and skilled in the ba-,23
NA,"sics. In refusing to be accountable to parents,",23
NA,Minister Anna Bligh is following the lead of,23
NA,"the Leader of the Opposition who, as educa-",23
NA,"tion minister, hid from parents the fact that",23
NA,one-third of Australia's school children were,23
NA,unable to read or write to acceptable stan-,23
NA,dards.,23
NA,A knowledge nation will not work if 30,23
NA,per cent of the children of that nation cannot,23
NA,read or write. If you cannot get the funda-,23
NA,"mentals right, you are going nowhere with",23
NA,the other programs. This hypocrisy seems to,23
NA,"know no bounds. Yesterday morning, when I",23
NA,saw the Courier-Mail editorial that my col-,23
NA,leagues have already alluded to in this de-,23
NA,"bate, I had a feeling that for the first time",23
NA,"justice is finally being done. At last, a sec-",23
NA,tion of the Queensland media have recog-,23
NA,"the paucity of Labor's claims and, to",23
NA,"quote from the Courier-Mail itself, how",23
NA,‘dishonest' was the campaign of the QTU. I,23
NA,"just hope that the rest of the media, particu-",23
NA,"larly the media in my electorate, are able to",23
NA,see through the QTU's patently dishonest,23
NA,marginal seats campaign. When it comes to,23
NA,"hypocrisy on this issue, the media does not",23
NA,have too far to look.,23
NA,"In Bundaberg, my Labor opponent's cam-",23
NA,"paign manager is also, believe it or not, the",23
NA,"local QTU spokesman, Greg Purches. I be-",23
NA,lieve that this creates a situation where voters,23
NA,can clearly see that the union are nothing,23
NA,more than a cheerleader for the local Labor,23
NA,"Party. Their arguments are transparent, mis-",23
NA,"leading-dare I say, sleazy-and, if taken to",23
NA,"their ultimate ends, dangerous for kids. I",23
NA,would welcome the chance to debate with,23
NA,"them on this issue in front of parents, teach-",23
NA,"ers and P&Cs, but I doubt that they will have",23
NA,"the guts, because I believe their campaign",23
NA,would be far too easily exposed. It is an echo,23
NA,of the AMWU's campaign in Hinkler in,23
NA,which they claim that the government has,24
NA,done nothing for manufacturing in the elec-,24
NA,torate. Anyone who knows the industrial,24
NA,towns of Australia will know that Gladstone,24
NA,is the powerhouse of good industry-yet,24
NA,they persist with this. It is part of this parallel,24
NA,campaign of the union running alongside the,24
NA,"Labor Party, trying to create this marginal",24
NA,"seats imagery where they say, ‘Oh, these",24
NA,things are not being looked after in this par-,24
NA,"ticular marginal seat.' But, in talking about",24
NA,the AMWU-and I am not going to dwell on,24
NA,"this-nothing could be further from the truth,",24
NA,and local people know it.,24
NA,"As of yesterday, I can identify $219 mil-",24
NA,lion that has been allocated by the federal,24
NA,government to industry seed funding or fa-,24
NA,"cilitation, or for trade promotion to assist",24
NA,local industries. I note that the minister at the,24
NA,"table, the Minister for Trade, was in my",24
NA,electorate last week as part of that facilita-,24
NA,tion. He had a lot to do with the $100 million,24
NA,announced last night for AMC; he was actu-,24
NA,ally at AMC with me as recently as last,24
NA,Thursday. He has also been responsible for,24
NA,$9 million worth of EMDG grants to export,24
NA,industries in my electorate. So the AMWU's,24
NA,campaign has no substance.,24
NA,"Let me return to the QTU, which have",24
NA,been following a similar tactic with the ALP.,24
NA,They have been in my electorate with mobile,24
NA,"billboards on the backs of trucks. Again, this",24
NA,is part of a blatantly misleading advertising,24
NA,campaign. The QTU's so-called facts are a,24
NA,gross misrepresentation of the truth and re-,24
NA,veal only a small piece of the total picture of,24
NA,education in Australia. The real facts are,24
NA,these. Government schools in Australia enrol,24
NA,"about 2.2 million students, about 69 per cent",24
NA,of the total enrolments. Students in govern-,24
NA,ment schools receive 78 per cent of the pub-,24
NA,lic Commonwealth and state funding for,24
NA,"schooling-not 30 per cent, as the QTU",24
NA,claim. Government schools in Australia re-,24
NA,ceive around $13.5 billion each year from,24
NA,the taxpayer. Non-government schools get,24
NA,about $3.5 billion of public funding for the,24
NA,one million students that they look after.,24
NA,"There are around 430,000 students in gov-",24
NA,"ernment schools in Queensland and 307,000",24
NA,in non-government schools. Commonwealth,24
NA,and state spending on government school,24
NA,students in Queensland is around $3.7 billion,24
NA,a year. Direct Commonwealth funding alone,24
NA,for Queensland government schools in 2002,24
NA,"will be $440 million, an increase of 52 per",24
NA,cent over Labor's last year in office. That is,24
NA,an extraordinary figure. That is way ahead of,24
NA,everything that inflation can account for.,24
NA,The Queensland government has not,24
NA,matched the Commonwealth's rate of in-,24
NA,crease in funding for government schools.,24
NA,Queensland increased its state expenditure,24
NA,on government schools in its last budget by,24
NA,"4.1 per cent, compared with the Common-",24
NA,wealth's increase to Queensland government,24
NA,schools of 5 per cent. Most of this state's,24
NA,increase was taken up with a pay rise of 4½,24
NA,"per cent to teachers, at a cost in 2001-02 of",24
NA,$215 million. I do not quibble for a minute,24
NA,with teachers receiving adequate and proper,24
NA,"remuneration. However, it is one thing to say",24
NA,that the schools are not being properly,24
NA,funded but another thing not to tell the public,24
NA,that most of the increase that went to the,24
NA,state school system in the current year actu-,24
NA,ally went substantially to teachers' pay. That,24
NA,"is fair enough, but parents are entitled to",24
NA,know where the money goes.,24
NA,"Items in the latest Queensland budget,",24
NA,such as the $3.7 million for the Quality,24
NA,"Teacher Program, are paid in full by the",24
NA,Commonwealth. The QTU fails to mention,24
NA,that. By 2002 the Commonwealth govern-,24
NA,ment will spend $669 million more in gov-,24
NA,"ernment schools than in 1996, an increase of",24
NA,"43 per cent. By contrast, the number of stu-",24
NA,dents in government schools has risen by,24
NA,only one per cent. A 43 per cent increase in,24
NA,funding; increase in students one per cent.,24
NA,The QTU's ‘facts' on non-government,24
NA,schools are equally misleading. Under the,24
NA,"Commonwealth's new funding model, in",24
NA,2004 schools serving the most needy com-,24
NA,"munities will receive funding of $4,368 for",24
NA,"each primary student and $5,721 for each",24
NA,secondary student. This compares with,24
NA,"$8,172 in total funding for students in gov-",24
NA,ernment schools. Non-government schools,24
NA,serving the most needy communities are,24
NA,funded to a level of 70 per cent of what it,24
NA,costs to educate a student in a government,24
NA,"school. By comparison, the schools serving",24
NA,the wealthiest communities will in 2004 re-,24
NA,ceive only $855 for each primary student and,25
NA,"$1,120 for each secondary student. This is",25
NA,just 13.7 per cent of what it costs to educate,25
NA,a student in a government school. This 13.7,25
NA,per cent is hardly an indulgent amount of,25
NA,money being spent in private schools. These,25
NA,arrangements will inject $38 million extra,25
NA,into Queensland non-government schools in,25
NA,2004 when the new funding model is fully,25
NA,implemented. This will go substantially to,25
NA,"Catholic, Anglican, Adventist and Christian",25
NA,schools and also to community schools.,25
NA,Labor and the QTU are acting as if the,25
NA,way government and non-government,25
NA,"schools are funded is something new. In fact,",25
NA,this system where the state provides the ma-,25
NA,jority of government school funding and the,25
NA,federal government takes responsibility for,25
NA,providing a much lower funding level for,25
NA,non-government schools has been in vogue,25
NA,"since 1973, and elements of it since even",25
NA,earlier than that. It is interesting,25
NA,the government that laid the foundations in,25
NA,1973 for this type of break-up of government,25
NA,and non-government funding was in fact the,25
NA,Whitlam Labor government. It is funny to,25
NA,see the teachers union railing against it at,25
NA,present in its refined form. Despite this his-,25
NA,"torical basis for the funding regime, we have",25
NA,the teachers unions having a fundamental,25
NA,commitment to remove all public funding,25
NA,"from every non-government school, includ-",25
NA,ing Catholic parish and indigenous commu-,25
NA,nity schools.,25
NA,"Unlike the National Party, the QTU and",25
NA,the Labor Party are opposed to parents hav-,25
NA,ing a choice in education. We in the National,25
NA,Party believe that parents have the right to,25
NA,"choose the best schools for their child,",25
NA,whether it is in the government or non-,25
NA,"government sector, and that the public good",25
NA,is served in providing public funding for the,25
NA,education of every Australian student. By,25
NA,"choosing a non-government school, parents",25
NA,accept that their costs will not be fully cov-,25
NA,"ered, but they also do a public service by",25
NA,removing some of the burden from the public,25
NA,"system, reducing pressure on the public",25
NA,purse and keeping class sizes down. So that I,25
NA,"am not misquoted on this, let me make it",25
NA,perfectly clear where I am coming from on,25
NA,this issue. I have no particular favour for,25
NA,"government or non-government schools, but",25
NA,I have a passionate belief in choice. Some of,25
NA,"my children have gone to both systems, so I",25
NA,am in a position to judge: what suits one,25
NA,child in one system may not suit another,25
NA,child in another system. So I make no pejo-,25
NA,"rative statements about either system, nor do",25
NA,I totally endorse both systems. What I am,25
NA,saying is that parents should have the fun-,25
NA,damental choice.,25
NA,Let us look at what the teachers union,25
NA,have to say about this. When appearing be-,25
NA,fore the Senate inquiry into the states grants,25
NA,bill in July 2000 the AEU said it had long,25
NA,opposed any funding to private schools and,25
NA,would continue to do so. Nothing could be,25
NA,clearer than that. When asked on ABC Radio,25
NA,on 15 March 2001:,25
NA,... do you want the government to stop funding,25
NA,private schools in all shapes and forms?,25
NA,"Sue Simpson, of the NSW Teachers Federa-",25
NA,to note that tion said:,25
NA,Well. that's certainly the ideal position of the,25
NA,Teachers Federation.,25
NA,Nothing could be clearer as to what their,25
NA,attitude is. We all know that sooner or later,25
NA,"union policy becomes ALP policy, so what",25
NA,parents have to look forward to is certainly,25
NA,not the best.,25
NA,There is another crime of education hy-,25
NA,pocrisy being carried out by the Labor Party,25
NA,"in my electorate, and that concerns a small",25
NA,Gladstone non-government school. The edu-,25
NA,cation of students at St Stephen's College has,25
NA,been put at risk because the Labor Party will,25
NA,not pass the bill to establish its grants in the,25
NA,Senate. This small Anglican school of 122,25
NA,students will be denied the October instal-,25
NA,"ment of $15,250 from its establishment grant",25
NA,if the Labor Party does not do a backflip and,25
NA,vote in favour of establishment grants for,25
NA,"new schools, including this one. St Stephen's",25
NA,is a fine example of a can-do school. It,25
NA,serves its community well and it has strong,25
NA,"leadership from its principal, Peter Fowler.",25
NA,"He tells me it is not a rich school, nor are the",25
NA,parents of the students who attend it rich. Mr,25
NA,Fowler told me that parents of students at the,25
NA,school work their hearts out on the factory,25
NA,floors of industries in Gladstone so that they,25
NA,can have a choice of education for their chil-,25
NA,dren. They deserve something better.,25
NA,The Leader of the Opposition was in,26
NA,"Gladstone recently but, surprisingly, he did",26
NA,not find time to go to one of these schools.,26
NA,He was more interested in running around,26
NA,"with corflute signs, signing his signature",26
NA,"alongside that of his Labor candidate, trying",26
NA,to convince the public that he had a new-,26
NA,found love of the public ownership of gov-,26
NA,"ernment facilities. Of course, he did not",26
NA,mention anything about the Commonwealth,26
NA,Bank or Qantas.,26
Mr LATHAM ,Werriwa) (11.32 a.m.)-I,26
NA,think it is a great shame that the previous,26
NA,"speaker, the member for Hinkler, was so",26
NA,negative in his remarks. In his 20-minute,26
NA,speech he spent more time talking about the,26
NA,Labor Party than the reading and writing,26
NA,skills of young people in his electorate. He,26
NA,was so short of ideas for improving literacy,26
NA,and numeracy performance that he spent a,26
NA,good part of his speech talking about the,26
NA,Australian Manufacturing Workers Union. I,26
NA,think it is regrettable indeed.,26
NA,"Unfortunately, much of this debate has",26
NA,been about the literacy and numeracy pro-,26
NA,grams of the Keating government. Surely,26
NA,this issue is too important for an exercise in,26
NA,political point scoring; surely when it comes,26
NA,to something as vital as the literacy and nu-,26
NA,meracy of young Australians the future,26
NA,counts for much more than the past. While,26
NA,ever this government bangs on about the,26
NA,things that happened or did not happen six,26
NA,years ago it will continue to overlook the,26
NA,education reforms that need to happen now.,26
NA,My focus in this debate is to be as positive,26
NA,as possible and to suggest to the minister and,26
NA,others the need for further reform in Austra-,26
NA,lia's literacy and numeracy program. We,26
NA,need to build on the fledgling success of the,26
NA,basic skills testing and national benchmark-,26
NA,ing in our schools. We need to do more in six,26
NA,key areas of education reform.,26
NA,The first area is to improve our perform-,26
NA,ance in early childhood education. Early,26
NA,childhood education in Australia has been,26
NA,undervalued and underresourced for too,26
NA,long. Every report on knowledge highlights,26
NA,the importance of early learning. We now,26
NA,know that the infant years are more impor-,26
NA,tant to literacy and numeracy than had been,26
NA,previously thought. An infant's grasp of lan-,26
NA,guage formed through speaking and listening,26
NA,in the early years is fundamental to the de-,26
NA,velopment of good literacy skills at school.,26
NA,"For every dollar of early education spending,",26
NA,it is possible to save seven dollars of public,26
NA,money in subsequent outlays on remedial,26
NA,services.,26
NA,"Unfortunately, however, Australia has",26
NA,been slow to act on this compelling research.,26
NA,"As a nation, we have underestimated the im-",26
NA,portance of early childhood and underresour-,26
NA,ced its learning opportunities. Only 25 per,26
NA,cent of three-year-olds and 70 per cent of,26
NA,four-year-olds in this country attend pre-,26
NA,school. This has left Australia near the bot-,26
NA,tom of the OECD league table. Whereas on,26
NA,average infants in this country spend just,26
NA,"eight months in pre-primary education, in",26
NA,"France, Sweden, Germany and Japan they",26
NA,spend at least 30 months. You can see the,26
NA,comparison and the way in which we lag,26
NA,behind.,26
NA,Australia needs to match this level of par-,26
NA,ticipation. Provision needs to be made for all,26
NA,"four-year-olds to access a preschool place,",26
NA,along with a significantly higher proportion,26
NA,of three-year-olds. This requires improved,26
NA,federal-state cooperation and the implemen-,26
NA,tation of a national preschool plan. Under the,26
NA,"current system, participation rates and",26
NA,teaching standards vary widely across the,26
NA,"states and territories. In addition, the educa-",26
NA,tional component in Australia's child-care,26
NA,"centres needs to be upgraded, particularly",26
NA,with regard to the professional qualifications,26
NA,"and training of staff. At the moment, only",26
NA,one in every two long day child centres in,26
NA,this country employs qualified preschool,26
NA,teachers. That is not good enough.,26
NA,A preschool education should also be,26
NA,made universal in terms of the assessment of,26
NA,learning needs. All four-year-olds should be,26
NA,"tested for learning disabilities, especially in",26
NA,speech and hearing. Up to 15 per cent of,26
NA,Australian children have speech and lan-,26
NA,"guage disorders, many at a severe level. That",26
NA,is a very distressing statistic. The whole les-,26
NA,"son in the research, and I think in common-",26
NA,"sense, would say that you need to get those",26
NA,problems early and to invest early in reme-,26
NA,dial action to deal with those disabilities.,26
NA,Often the difficulties are not identified and,26
NA,not corrected until well into the school years.,27
NA,Remedial programs need to be brought for-,27
NA,ward to preschool. Every child should arrive,27
NA,at school with a clear assessment of their,27
NA,learning capabilities and disabilities. Quality,27
NA,literacy and numeracy programs at school,27
NA,need to build on the success of the pre-,27
NA,primary years. Australia desperately needs a,27
NA,national preschool plan of action.,27
NA,The second reform that needs to be un-,27
NA,dertaken is to do more in our secondary,27
NA,schools with respect to literacy and nu-,27
NA,meracy performance. We have a big problem,27
NA,in our high school system. A number of uni-,27
NA,versity studies have revealed huge difficul-,27
NA,"ties in the level of reading, writing and",27
NA,"speaking skills in grades 7, 8 and 9. For most",27
NA,"students in the early secondary years, reading",27
NA,progress slows down and then levels out.,27
NA,"Even worse, one in four pupils actually goes",27
NA,backwards in their basic skills. This is a na-,27
NA,tional crisis: one in four Australian students,27
NA,goes backwards in the early high school,27
NA,"years in their basic reading, writing and nu-",27
NA,meracy skills. I take as my source the re-,27
NA,search conducted at Melbourne University,27
NA,by Peter Hill and Jean Russell. One of their,27
NA,reports states:,27
NA,The mapping of pupil learning progress across,27
NA,the compulsory years of schooling revealed that,27
NA,there was virtually no growth during the middle,27
NA,"years in reading, writing, speaking and listening.",27
NA,... reading progress plateaus in grades 5 to 8 for,27
NA,"most pupils, while for the lowest 25 per cent there",27
NA,"was an actual decline in achievement, particularly",27
NA,in the first year of secondary school (grade 7). It school.,27
NA,was also evident that underachievement persists,27
NA,longer and is greater among boys than girls.,27
NA,The crisis is worse for boys than for girls.,27
NA,This is a very distressing statistic. At a time,27
NA,"when most parents-and indeed, all the",27
NA,community-would be expecting their chil-,27
NA,dren to be learning more and getting ready,27
NA,"for the challenges of adulthood, one in four",27
NA,students is worse off compared with when,27
NA,they left grade 5 in primary school. These,27
NA,middle school years can be a black hole for,27
NA,"the reading, writing and numeracy skills of a",27
NA,large number of Australian students. The,27
NA,"Minister for Education, Training and Youth",27
NA,"Affairs, Dr Kemp, is aware of these research",27
NA,"findings but, unfortunately, he has done",27
NA,nothing about them. For 5ò years as educa-,27
NA,tion minister he has failed to introduce basic,27
NA,literacy and numeracy testing in grades 7 and,27
NA,9. He has not spent one extra dollar on the,27
NA,remedial programs and specialist teachers,27
NA,needed to tackle this problem.,27
NA,This is a big community concern. I say to,27
NA,every parent and to every citizen in this,27
NA,country who is worried about the behaviour,27
NA,of young adolescents that the crisis that,27
NA,needs to be addressed is in middle schooling.,27
NA,"The problems with boys, the problems on",27
NA,"our streets, the problems with law and order,",27
NA,with drug abuse-so many of these have,27
NA,their origins in the difficulties in the middle,27
NA,school years. We have a national crisis on,27
NA,"our hands, but we do not have a national re-",27
NA,sponse from this government. If secondary,27
NA,"students cannot read and write properly, they",27
NA,have next to no chance of finding jobs upon,27
NA,leaving school. Education failure is a one-,27
NA,way ticket to a lifetime of trouble. The re-,27
NA,search has identified the problem; we need a,27
NA,government willing to act and resolve this,27
NA,national crisis.,27
NA,We need a vigorous program of middle,27
NA,school reform-and this is my third area of,27
NA,advocacy. We need to rethink the strategies,27
NA,"for years 5 to 10, these vital middle years of",27
NA,school education. We need to introduce a,27
NA,system of home rooms and home teachers so,27
NA,that students can be familiar with their men-,27
NA,tors and teachers. This is the best way of,27
NA,helping students through what can be a diffi-,27
NA,cult transition from primary to secondary,27
NA,We also need to introduce a larger compo-,27
NA,nent of project based learning in our schools,27
NA,to make every classroom and every exercise,27
NA,a rich task in learning. Young people need,27
NA,the challenge that comes from project based,27
NA,"learning, in environmental projects and civic",27
NA,projects and other community based initia-,27
NA,tives. This engages them and teaches them,27
NA,"the habit of learning by doing, plus the prac-",27
NA,tical benefits and teamwork that come from,27
NA,this particular approach.,27
NA,We also need to open up more diverse,27
NA,learning options in the middle school years. I,27
NA,envisage the middle school as a hub to which,27
NA,a range of learning settings can be con-,27
NA,nected. Not every student will learn through,27
NA,the traditional academic curriculum; students,27
NA,learn in a variety of ways. The early adolesimportance,28
NA,cent years are a period of rapid change and,28
NA,"challenge for many young people. So, too,",28
NA,their learning interests change and are chalsolutely,28
NA,lenged. We need to excite the diverse learn-,28
NA,ing interests of Australia's young population,28
NA,by opening up diverse learning options and,28
NA,curricula in each of our schools. I envisage,28
NA,"the middle school as a hub, connected to op-",28
NA,"tions in multimedia, the use of museums and",28
NA,"libraries, the use of the performing arts and",28
NA,of manual practical skills in the education,28
NA,system. We need to build the learning envi-,28
NA,ronment around the unique needs of every,28
NA,"student, instead of making the assumption",28
NA,that one size might fit all in school educa-,28
NA,tion.,28
NA,There is an excellent example of this,28
NA,"proach in my electorate, at Macquarie Fields.",28
NA,A program called the MACThing has had out-,28
NA,standing success in reconnecting young peo-,28
NA,ple to the benefits of literacy and numeracy,28
NA,"education. But, for all its success, it still",28
NA,lacks adequate funding from the federal and,28
NA,state government departments. It also lacks,28
NA,the flexibility and support to make sure that,28
NA,they do not have red tape and bureaucracy,28
NA,standing in the way of further success. The,28
NA,MACThing is a more informal environment of,28
NA,learning where the students do not feel that,28
NA,they are in a regimented classroom-the,28
NA,thing that they have rebelled against. It,28
NA,builds pastoral care and support for the,28
NA,"dents, trust between teacher and student,",28
NA,thereby re-engaging these troubled young,28
NA,people with the benefits of education. The,28
NA,New South Wales Department of Education,28
NA,has said that the MACThing is not acceptable,28
NA,for 13and 14-year-olds to be part of its,28
NA,work; 13and 14-year olds in the eyes of the,28
NA,education department need to be in the for-,28
NA,mal school environment. But these students,28
NA,have turned their backs on the formal class-,28
NA,room. Why can't the MACThing be regarded,28
NA,"as an annex, as part of the local government",28
NA,high school and be part of the funding sup-,28
NA,port and flexibility available from the New,28
NA,South Wales Department of Education? We,28
NA,have much work to do in the vital area of,28
NA,middle school reform.,28
NA,A fourth area of reform is with regard to,28
NA,disadvantaged schooling. We all know the,28
NA,of literacy and numeracy right,28
NA,across the country. Literacy and numeracy,28
NA,are all-important for all schools but are ab-,28
NA,vital for disadvantaged areas. Some,28
NA,people say that we need to go soft on stan-,28
NA,"dards and testing, that rigorous testing can be",28
NA,too hard on students. I say that this attitude,28
NA,"of softness is not doing anyone any favours,",28
NA,and it particularly hurts students in disad-,28
NA,vantaged schools. Australia's national pro-,28
NA,gram of basic skills testing is not being im-,28
NA,plemented rigorously enough. Evidence has,28
NA,come to light that these tests have been,28
NA,‘dumbed down' to make it easier for schools,28
NA,to reach the minimum benchmark.,28
NA,Of even greater concern is the fact that the,28
NA,performance of disadvantaged schools in,28
NA,ap- literacy and numeracy remains poor. It is,28
NA,estimated that up to one-third of eight-year-,28
NA,olds in disadvantaged areas cannot read and,28
NA,write to an acceptable standard. Those who,28
NA,want to go soft betray the interests of those,28
NA,students. Unless those students have the rig-,28
NA,"orous testing, benchmarking, teacher support",28
NA,"and resourcing to get results, they will never",28
NA,get a fair start in life. Increased resources and,28
NA,more effective intervention strategies are,28
NA,needed to overcome this problem.,28
NA,We also need greater flexibility in the run-,28
NA,ning of reading recovery programs in disad-,28
NA,vantaged schools. Recently I had the pleas-,28
NA,ure of speaking to the principal of Claymore,28
NA,"stuPublic School in my electorate, and he was",28
NA,talking about the New South Wales govern-,28
NA,ment's reading recovery program. He said,28
NA,"the reality for his school was that, if he took",28
NA,on the recommended number of reading re-,28
NA,"covery teachers, they would have to take the",28
NA,whole class; they would basically have to,28
NA,take the whole school. In disadvantaged ar-,28
NA,eas the problem with literacy and numeracy,28
NA,can be so acute that the targeted reading re-,28
NA,covery program is not adequate in the way in,28
NA,which it is organised. The principal at Clay-,28
NA,"more has recommended a return to phonics,",28
NA,"whole class teaching, extra teachers in the",28
NA,"classroom, and also an emphasis on rote",28
NA,"learning. Sometimes this is discouraged, but",28
NA,let us not confuse reality with theory. The,28
NA,reality is that a lot of students get self-esteem,28
NA,and confidence out of rote learning- the,28
NA,confidence that comes from getting a lot of,28
NA,answers right. They need that confidence and,29
NA,self-esteem to move onto harder and richer,29
NA,tasks. We need to be practical in this. We,29
NA,need to identify the things that work in par-,29
NA,ticular circumstances and back those pro-,29
NA,grams as vigorously as possible. One size,29
NA,does not fit all when it comes to disadvan-,29
NA,taged schooling.,29
NA,I also say that we have had too much tol-,29
NA,erance for failing schools. The greatest crime,29
NA,"against a child, particularly a child from a",29
NA,"poor background, is to give them a poor edu-",29
NA,cation; to deny them educational opportuni-,29
NA,ties through good schooling and a good,29
NA,learning environment at home. I want all,29
NA,state and territory governments to rigorously,29
NA,publish results and to make comparisons,29
NA,between good and failing schools. I want,29
NA,failing schools to be identified. Schools that,29
NA,are failing to add value to the education and,29
NA,"future of their students need to be identified,",29
NA,and we need to do something about it. We,29
NA,should have zero tolerance of underper-,29
NA,forming schools in this country. We should,29
NA,"close them down and bring in the experts, the",29
NA,resources and the innovations to get results.,29
NA,The only thing that matters in education is,29
NA,results. We should identify these failing,29
NA,schools and bring in the people who can get,29
NA,results for the students who are desperately,29
NA,in need.,29
NA,The fifth area of reform concerns class,29
NA,sizes. Australia needs a national program to,29
NA,bring down the size of our junior primary,29
NA,classes. This would allow teachers to im-,29
NA,"prove the quality of classroom instruction,",29
NA,which is the key to stronger literacy and nu-,29
NA,meracy in the first three years of school. A,29
NA,number of studies have demonstrated that,29
NA,students in smaller classes achieve signifi-,29
NA,cantly higher scores. Follow-up research has,29
NA,shown the durability of these gains. Smaller,29
NA,class sizes in the junior primary years in-,29
NA,crease the level of student progress for the,29
NA,remainder of the school years. These are,29
NA,gains that stick on for the remainder of,29
NA,school education.,29
NA,"By international standards, Australia is",29
NA,lagging behind. It is estimated that 80 per,29
NA,cent of our early primary classes have more,29
NA,than 20 students; two in five have more than,29
NA,25 students. Other nations are doing much,29
NA,better. Governments in Europe and North,29
NA,America are acknowledging what every,29
NA,teacher has long known: smaller class sizes,29
NA,improve the quality of learning. There is no,29
NA,doubt about it-in the early primary years,29
NA,smaller class sizes improve the quality of,29
NA,"learning. In the United States, for instance,",29
NA,the government is funding a national pro-,29
NA,gram to reduce primary class sizes to an av-,29
NA,erage of 18. Australia needs to match this,29
NA,effort and give our young people the same,29
NA,head start in life. Our children may be 20 per,29
NA,"cent of the population, but we are guaranteed",29
NA,that they are 100 per cent of our future.,29
NA,The sixth and final area of reform I would,29
NA,advocate concerns the vital role of parents as,29
NA,educators. I regard school education as only,29
NA,one-half of the equation. It is only 50 per,29
NA,cent of the learning experience. Learning,29
NA,does not begin and end at the school gate. It,29
NA,is a whole of life process and it requires a,29
NA,quality learning environment at home. Re-,29
NA,cently I had the pleasure of reading a book,29
NA,by Mem Fox. It is a best-selling book in this,29
NA,"country, and it is called Reading Magic. She",29
NA,"presents research demonstrating that, if we",29
NA,read to our infant children at least three sto-,29
NA,"rybooks a day, no Australian child will be",29
NA,illiterate. It is a vital investment for parents,29
NA,to spend at least 30 minutes a day reading at,29
NA,least three storybooks to their children. If all,29
NA,"parents in this country do that, according to",29
NA,"the research and according to commonsense,",29
NA,we would not have a literacy problem in this,29
NA,nation. I can proudly report to the parliament,29
NA,that Oliver Dennis Latham enjoys having,29
NA,read to him at least three books a day. My,29
NA,favourite books have become his favourites;,29
NA,"he has no say in it as yet, but when it comes",29
NA,"to Dr Seuss's Fox in Sox, Green Eggs and",29
NA,"Ham, and How the Grinch Stole Christmas, I",29
NA,love reading to him and I know the benefits,29
NA,that apply to my little boy. I want those bene-,29
NA,fits to apply across the country.,29
NA,All parents must read to their children.,29
NA,Never think you have not got enough time,29
NA,Never think you have not got the potential.,29
NA,Everyone can read to their children. For,29
NA,"those who have not got the skills right now,",29
NA,we should be providing courses. We should,29
NA,have adult and community education courses,29
NA,through which parents can become more ef-,29
NA,fective educators in the home. If they do not,30
NA,feel that they have the literacy skills to be,30
NA,"reading and assisting with homework, then",30
NA,the role of government is to identify those,30
NA,parents and provide the courses to bring their,30
NA,skills up to standard. If some parents are not,30
NA,"willing to engage in such programs, we",30
NA,should apply mutual responsibility programs.,30
NA,This is a basic responsibility of parent-,30
NA,hood-to assist the education of children. I,30
NA,"think that, in the vast majority of cases,",30
NA,Australian parents want to be good educators,30
NA,"in the home, and most are. But for those who",30
NA,"have not got the skills, we should provide the",30
NA,"courses. For those who still say no, we",30
NA,should apply policies of mutual obligation. I,30
NA,"note in the United States, for instance, that",30
NA,some of the state governments have a policy,30
NA,"whereby, if people live in public housing",30
NA,"areas, they must agree to engage in adult",30
NA,education courses. It provides more effective,30
NA,skills for themselves and more effective edu-,30
NA,cation for their children at home. We should,30
NA,do the same in this country.,30
NA,If parents still lack the capacity to act as,30
NA,"educators in the home, we should bring in",30
NA,mentors. We should harness the vast skills of,30
NA,retired teachers and retired professional peo-,30
NA,ple-the vast and growing army of retired,30
NA,Australians who can provide mentoring and,30
NA,"assistance in the home as educators. Finally,",30
NA,I will quote an excellent letter to the Daily,30
NA,Telegraph yesterday from Bernadette,30
NA,"Sweeney, a resident of Kiama. She wrote:",30
NA,Perhaps local schools or community centres need,30
NA,to advertise for “grandparent” figures to volunteer,30
NA,to assist in programs that could be implemented,30
NA,in mentoring children in need.,30
NA,I'm sure the self-funded retirees who John How-,30
NA,ard is so keen to compensate would dearly love to,30
NA,"give some time in this way, in return for what the",30
NA,community is prepared to give them. It would,30
NA,definitely be more fulfilling than worrying about,30
NA,which trip to take or which financial adviser to,30
NA,choose.,30
NA,It is true that in this parliament we often en-,30
NA,courage financial interests to move to the,30
NA,front of the public policy agenda. There is a,30
NA,"vast community interest here, and that is to",30
NA,provide mentors and assistance for children,30
NA,"in need, particularly when it comes to liter-",30
NA,acy and numeracy.,30
NA,I commend these six proposals to the,30
NA,House and urgently suggest to the govern-,30
NA,ment that it take them on board to deal with,30
NA,the problems in literacy and numeracy per-,30
NA,formance in this country.,30
Mr BAIRD ,Cook) (11.52 a.m.)-It is my,30
NA,pleasure to support the States Grants (Pri-,30
NA,mary and Secondary Education Assistance),30
NA,Amendment Bill 2001 today. I commend the,30
NA,member for Werriwa on his speech and his,30
NA,ideas and thoughts on education. We know,30
NA,that the Labor Party are not interested in his,30
NA,ideas on education because they moved him,30
NA,off the frontbench and rejected his ideas at,30
NA,the last election. A lot of interesting ideas,30
NA,"were put forward, but innovative ideas are",30
NA,never encouraged amongst the ALP.,30
NA,This bill is of great encouragement to,30
NA,those who live in my electorate and to the,30
NA,"Australian people, because the government",30
NA,has shown in clear terms its support for both,30
NA,government and non-government schools in,30
NA,"this country. Firstly, the bill provides legisla-",30
NA,tive authority to the recent budgetary meas-,30
NA,ure of $33.3 million over the coming two,30
NA,financial years to continue strategic assis-,30
NA,tance in schools and to support literacy and,30
NA,numeracy research. It is important that we,30
NA,recognise the ongoing strategic assistance.,30
NA,"Secondly, the bill ensures that commitments",30
NA,to non-government schools are met. It,30
NA,amends the State Grants (Primary and Sec-,30
NA,"ondary Education Assistance) Act 2000,",30
NA,which is the principal vehicle authorising,30
NA,funding for the 2001-04 funding period to,30
NA,include this additional funding and to ensure,30
NA,that the government's commitment to non-,30
NA,government schools continues. It is impor-,30
NA,tant to note that the bill makes no changes to,30
NA,policy; it simply appropriates the extra,30
NA,amount because the number of enrolments in,30
NA,new schools was higher than expected.,30
NA,"In a press release earlier today, the Minis-",30
NA,"ter for Education, Training and Youth Affairs",30
NA,noted that last year Labor said that it fa-,30
NA,voured extra funding for needy non-,30
NA,"government schools. On 5 October last year,",30
NA,the member for Dobell said:,30
NA,It's at the low-fee Christian schools where the real,30
NA,need is.,30
NA,"On the following day, he said:",30
NA,Labor's not against extra money for private,31
NA,"schools, especially needy private schools.",31
NA,Yet in June the ALP voted against estab-,31
NA,lishment funds for needy non-government,31
NA,schools. It continues to endanger the funding,31
NA,of more than 50 new schools. All members,31
NA,would be aware of the hypocrisy of the ALP.,31
NA,An example is the stunt by the Leader of the,31
NA,"Opposition this morning, who came in with",31
NA,"his own charter of budget honesty when, for",31
NA,"13 years, Labor totally ignored all aspects of",31
NA,it in its administration of the Treasury bench.,31
NA,It is the same with the shadow minister,31
NA,"education, the member for Dobell, who goes",31
NA,"around the country saying, ‘Yes, you're ex-",31
NA,actly the type of school that should receive,31
NA,funding-small private schools should re-,31
NA,ceive it; the Christian schools out in the,31
NA,Western suburbs should receive it.' If that is,31
NA,"what Labor believe in, let them support it",31
NA,"with votes on the floor of this House. But, of",31
NA,"course, they will not do that in here; it be-",31
NA,comes an entirely different situation because,31
NA,they get their ruling directions from the,31
NA,Teachers Federation. I have certainly had,31
NA,representatives from the Teachers Federation,31
NA,come to see me. They attack me because,31
NA,their view is that the government is not pro-,31
NA,viding enough funding to government,31
NA,schools. Record funding has been provided,31
NA,to schools around Australia by this govern-,31
NA,ment.,31
NA,Eighty-five per cent of funding to gov-,31
NA,ernment schools must come from state edu-,31
NA,"cation authorities, but the Teachers Federa-",31
NA,tion never want to know about that. They,31
NA,want to take the 15 per cent that the federal,31
NA,government is responsible for and beat us up,31
NA,without looking at the record of some of the,31
NA,"state governments. In New South Wales,",31
NA,funding has gone backwards. They do not,31
NA,want to talk about the funding under this,31
NA,"government, which has continued to escalate.",31
NA,"They simply say, ‘Yes, but a lot of it is",31
NA,into private schools.',31
NA,"I have asked them, ‘Don't you believe in",31
NA,choice?' The people who live in my elector-,31
NA,"ate, who pay their taxes, are very happy for",31
NA,there to be government schools and private,31
NA,"schools, but they should have the capacity to",31
NA,make the choice as to where their children,31
NA,"should go. If they are paying their taxes, they",31
NA,would expect that that part of their taxation,31
NA,money would come back into educating their,31
NA,children-educating them according to the,31
NA,interests and the ideals that they as parents,31
NA,have for their children. The answer I got,31
NA,from one of the representatives of the Teach-,31
NA,"ers Federation was, ‘No, I do not believe in",31
NA,choice. There is a government system. We,31
NA,should do all we can to encourage the gov-,31
NA,"ernment system, and that is the end of it.' So",31
NA,"I said, ‘You are really talking about the Sta-",31
NA,linist view of no choice.' We all saw how,31
NA,for that ended up in the Soviet Union. They pro-,31
NA,vide government monopolies-government,31
NA,"run factories, a government run distribution",31
NA,system and retail outlets. The result was that,31
NA,the economy of the Soviet Union has col-,31
NA,lapsed.,31
NA,People need choice. It provides a com-,31
NA,"petitive environment, with private schools",31
NA,"competing against government schools, and",31
NA,"vice versa. In New South Wales, we have",31
NA,seen some outstanding HSC results from,31
NA,"government schools. In my electorate,",31
NA,"Caringbah High, St George Girls High,",31
NA,"James Ruse High, North Sydney High and",31
NA,Sydney High all have an outstanding record,31
NA,"as government schools, but many of the pri-",31
NA,vate schools in Sydney have also performed,31
NA,outstandingly in the HSC. Sydney Grammar,31
NA,and Knox are amongst those. Across the,31
NA,"board, we have seen significant achievement.",31
NA,People having a choice is at the nub of the,31
NA,government's philosophy.,31
NA,The fact is that more than 50 per cent of,31
NA,members opposite come from trade union,31
NA,backgrounds and they have a strong belief in,31
NA,the trade union system and the role that trade,31
NA,unions play in society. We do not object to,31
NA,"the role that trade unions play, but we do",31
NA,object when they overstep that role and dic-,31
NA,"tate to the Australian community, saying,",31
NA,‘You shall have no choice. We want only,31
NA,going government schools to be funded. We don't,31
NA,believe any funding should be provided to,31
NA,some of the non-government schools.' That,31
NA,"is hypocritical for two reasons. I know that,",31
NA,"on the opposition frontbench, the shadow",31
NA,"minister for education, the member for Do-",31
NA,"bell, did not go to a government school-and",31
NA,that is fine. He went to a very good private,31
NA,school in my electorate. I would like to hear,31
NA,"him say, ‘Let's provide some equity in terms",32
NA,of the private sector. Let's provide assistance,32
NA,to independent schools and those schools,32
NA,"that are funded by the churches, so that peo-",32
NA,ple can have a choice.' It was his parents',32
NA,"choice to send him to a private school, and",32
NA,other parents across Australia should have,32
NA,that same right. What I hear time and time,32
NA,again from people in my electorate is that,32
NA,they want to be able to exercise that right to,32
NA,"choose. In fact, in my electorate I often hear",32
NA,the criticism that there are not enough private,32
NA,schools for them to go to.,32
NA,This bill provides more assistance to not,32
NA,only government schools but also non-,32
NA,government schools. I am proud to say that I,32
NA,went to a government school which provided,32
NA,a very significant level of education. Many,32
NA,members on the frontbench went to govern-,32
NA,"ment schools. The Prime Minister, for exam-",32
NA,"ple, went to Canterbury Boys High. I went to",32
NA,Port Hacking High. These were excellent,32
NA,schools. But this is about choice. If people,32
NA,"were not allowed a choice, we would be run-",32
NA,ning a small dictatorship in terms of how,32
NA,people should live their lives. The bill also,32
NA,makes some minor technical changes. The,32
NA,bill includes a small change to correct an,32
NA,error resulting from the change of the basis,32
NA,of funding from the previous quadrennial,32
NA,legislation.,32
NA,This bill highlights how much this gov-,32
NA,ernment has been giving to education in this,32
NA,country. This budget was the sixth budget in,32
NA,a row where schools funding has increased.,32
NA,This means that schools funding has hit a,32
NA,new record high. We are constantly criticised,32
NA,by the opposition in terms of funding for,32
NA,schools across Australia; yet we have hit this,32
NA,all-time high. Eighty-seven per cent of the,32
NA,funding for specific schools initiatives con-,32
NA,tained in this year's budget will go to gov-,32
NA,ernment schools-$238 million will go di-,32
NA,rectly to government schools-and $34.1,32
NA,million will be spent over five years to sup-,32
NA,port online curriculum development to en-,32
NA,sure that students are kept abreast of devel-,32
NA,opments in information technology. That is,32
NA,absolutely appropriate in this new IT era.,32
NA,The budget also provided $46.7 million to,32
NA,continue the successful Jobs Pathway pro-,32
NA,gram. This program enables the smooth tran-,32
NA,sition from school to the work force. It is a,32
NA,very significant program aimed at young,32
NA,people between 15 and 19. It is anticipated,32
NA,that this extra funding will assist some,32
NA,"70,000 young Australians, which is what we",32
NA,want to see.,32
NA,The $33.3 million program specifically,32
NA,dealt with by this legislation has been put in,32
NA,place to fund projects that will improve the,32
NA,educational opportunities for those students,32
NA,"who are recognised as being disadvantaged,",32
NA,particularly those with disabilities. This,32
NA,shows the compassion with which this area,32
NA,of the budget is administered. It is intended,32
NA,that the funding will be directed especially to,32
NA,the areas of literacy and numeracy. The op-,32
NA,position has expressed some concern that the,32
NA,funding has been announced only for the first,32
NA,two years of the funding quadrennium. How-,32
NA,"ever, the forward estimates have made room",32
NA,for further funding of almost $100 million,32
NA,over the 2003-04 and 2004-05 financial,32
NA,years.,32
NA,This government has an unsurpassed rec-,32
NA,ord in the areas of the literacy and nu-,32
NA,meracy-the building blocks of any person's,32
NA,"education. In 1997, a National Literacy and",32
NA,Numeracy Plan was agreed to by all state,32
NA,"and territory ministers. Among other things,",32
NA,the plan provided for all students in Australia,32
NA,to be tested on their literacy and numeracy,32
NA,needs in the earliest years of their education;,32
NA,"for all students in years 3, 5 and 7 to be as-",32
NA,sessed against national standards; and for,32
NA,consistent assessment of national levels of,32
NA,achievement with respect to these standards.,32
NA,This is the first ever nationally coordinated,32
NA,approach to literacy and numeracy in Aus-,32
NA,tralian history. Reporting back to the com-,32
NA,munity on student results against the national,32
NA,standards is already occurring. The plan has,32
NA,already seen a 13 per cent improvement in,32
NA,the reading abilities of year 3 students,32
NA,"around Australia. Four years ago, the na-",32
NA,tional school English survey showed that,32
NA,almost 30 per cent of year 3 students had,32
NA,failed to meet minimum standards of literacy.,32
NA,Data from March last year shows that that,32
NA,proportion has been halved.,32
NA,I would also like to make some comments,32
NA,about the emotive and misleading language,32
NA,that has been used in this debate. I have been,32
NA,"listening to the debate and, while the mem-",33
NA,ber for Werriwa has been outlining his own,33
NA,alternative proposal in relation to education,33
NA,instead of the standard one we get from the,33
NA,"ALP, there has been a lot of misleading in-",33
NA,formation-and we hear it all the time. The,33
NA,misleading leaflets that were handed out to,33
NA,the students in my electorate have in large,33
NA,letters on the front: ‘The Howard govern-,33
NA,ment is a threat to the great work in our pub-,33
NA,"lic schools'. The leaflet also claims that,",33
NA,"since the early 1980s, there has been a run-",33
NA,down of spending on public education. These,33
NA,are lies-pure lies. The leaflet neglects the,33
NA,fact that we have reached an all-time high in,33
NA,funding for government and non-government,33
NA,schools. The government can be justly proud,33
NA,of its record on education. The 2000-01,33
NA,budget made $22.3 billion available for,33
NA,school funding for the next quadrennium.,33
NA,That is a 32.6 per cent increase over the,33
NA,1997-2000 quadrennium and $402 million,33
NA,per year more than the ALP ever gave. These,33
NA,increases come at a time when enrolments in,33
NA,government schools have increased by less,33
NA,than three per cent. That is the government's,33
NA,record.,33
NA,It would be different if the Teachers Fed-,33
NA,eration worked on a factual basis when it,33
NA,"runs around my electorate, your electorate,",33
NA,"Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, and most other",33
NA,electorates in this country. The reality is,33
NA,the government have increased funding by,33
NA,record amounts. There has been a 32.6 per,33
NA,cent increase in funding. That is $402 mil-,33
NA,lion more than the ALP gave in its best year.,33
NA,That is not in terms of nominal dollars of the,33
NA,day; it is indexed dollars-real dollars of the,33
NA,day. There has been an extra $402 million,33
NA,per year from this government. Just in the,33
NA,"past year, there has been a 32.6 per cent in-",33
NA,"crease, yet the Teachers Federation in New",33
NA,South Wales and in other states goes around,33
NA,peddling lies to students. Concerned parents,33
NA,"come to me and say, ‘I read that you are cut-",33
NA,ting back significantly on funding to gov-,33
NA,ernment schools.' They outline the problems,33
NA,of their schools and say that this and that are,33
NA,"needed, and I say, ‘Look at this government's",33
NA,record compared with that of the previous,33
NA,"government, and look at the state govern-",33
NA,ments and what they are not doing in terms,33
NA,of their responsibility for 85 per cent of,33
NA,funding of government schools around Aus-,33
NA,tralia.',33
NA,The GST will provide a substantial in-,33
NA,crease in revenue to the states and it will,33
NA,fund the salary of every teacher in every,33
NA,school in every state in Australia. It is a,33
NA,growth tax. If the Teachers Federation wants,33
NA,"to complain about funding, let it talk to state",33
NA,education ministers and ask them to explain,33
NA,where the GST is going. This government is,33
NA,showing where the money is going: the 32.6,33
NA,per cent increase-the $402 million extra per,33
NA,year being put into school funding across,33
NA,Australia. It was particularly interesting to,33
NA,see that in its editorial the Courier-Mail took,33
NA,the Queensland Teachers Union to task and,33
NA,pointed out that state education is the respon-,33
NA,sibility of the state government. If education,33
NA,funding in Queensland has fallen short of,33
NA,what the Queensland Teachers Union thinks,33
NA,"is appropriate, the protest should be aimed at",33
NA,"the bottom end of George Street, not at Can-",33
NA,berra. The same applies in New South Wales:,33
NA,the protest should be addressed to Macquarie,33
NA,"Street in Sydney, not to Canberra. It is very",33
NA,clear that this government's record has been,33
NA,outstanding.,33
NA,Notwithstanding the difference in respon-,33
NA,"sibility, federal government funding for gov-",33
NA,ernment school students still remains thou-,33
NA,sands of dollars higher per student than,33
NA,that funding for students in any non-government,33
NA,school. Sixty-one per cent of federal funding,33
NA,for schools goes to government schools.,33
NA,"Some is allocated, but most is given to the",33
NA,states to maintain their responsibilities. The,33
NA,government's priority is clearly to offer a,33
NA,choice. We make no secret of that. We be-,33
NA,lieve that it is the right of every parent,33
NA,around Australia to decide which schools,33
NA,their child will go to and to review the serv-,33
NA,ices that are offered.,33
NA,"In conclusion, the debate has been full of",33
NA,rhetoric. The facts of the matter have been,33
NA,lacking on the opposition benches. The op-,33
NA,position have not highlighted the minister's,33
NA,real commitment to education and education,33
NA,standards. The strong emphasis on literacy,33
NA,and numeracy standards is the key to any,33
NA,significant education program. There has,33
NA,been a significant lift in literacy and nu-,33
NA,meracy testing and standards across Austra-,33
NA,lia. There is assistance and planning for,34
NA,those who are in a transitional phase from,34
NA,"school to work. Under this government, we",34
NA,have seen record funding being spent on de-,34
NA,"veloping literacy and numeracy standards,",34
NA,and outstanding assistance for smaller Chris-,34
NA,tian schools and independent schools across,34
NA,Australia. Talk to the parents of children who,34
NA,attend the many small independent schools,34
NA,across Australia and you will see the value of,34
NA,providing choice. Some very exciting things,34
NA,are happening in small independent schools,34
NA,"across Australia. If parents are not wealthy,",34
NA,the fees are often low. The government are,34
NA,putting education on the map and empower-,34
NA,"ing students, who are developing to their",34
NA,"fullest potential, and lifting numeracy and",34
NA,literacy standards. I for one am very proud of,34
NA,"the government's record in providing choice,",34

Mr ABBOTT ,Warringah-Minister for,36
NA,"Employment, Workplace Relations and",36
NA,Small Business) (12.13 p.m.)-I move:,36
NA,That the amendments be agreed to.,36
NA,I am very happy to support the Senate's,36
NA,amendments to the Workplace Relations,36
NA,Amendment (Termination of Employment),37
NA,"Bill 2000, because the bill now significantly",37
NA,improves the regime governing unfair dis-,37
NA,missals. The problem with the old unfair,37
NA,dismissal regime is that it has cost jobs and,37
NA,depressed employment in this country. The,37
NA,"unfair dismissal regime, as it stood first un-",37
NA,"der the former government's legislation, and",37
NA,even under the legislation that this govern-,37
NA,"ment put in place in 1996, put at its most",37
NA,"simple, is this: if it is expensive to let",37
NA,"go, it is hard to take people on. This govern-",37
NA,ment is about maximising opportunities for,37
NA,employment in this country. The Senate's,37
NA,changes are reasonable and fair. They should,37
NA,"give confidence to employers, particularly",37
NA,"small business employers, who are in the",37
NA,business of giving people jobs.,37
NA,I want briefly to run through the major,37
NA,changes that the Senate has put in place. Un-,37
NA,"der the bill as amended by the Senate, the",37
NA,Industrial Relations Commission will be able,37
NA,to impose penalties on lawyers and other,37
NA,advisers who encourage people to bring for-,37
NA,ward speculative and unmeritorious claims.,37
NA,"Under the changes in the bill as amended,",37
NA,lawyers and advisers will be required to de-,37
NA,clare up front that they are operating on a no,37
NA,"win, no fee basis. The commission will be",37
NA,able to exclude unmeritorious applications,37
NA,after an initial conciliation hearing. In con-,37
NA,"sidering these matters, the commission will",37
NA,be required to take into account the special,37
NA,circumstances that affect many small busi-,37
NA,nesses that are required to appear in unfair,37
NA,dismissal matters. The commission will be,37
NA,able to order costs in cases of unreasonable,37
NA,and completely unmeritorious unfair dis-,37
NA,"missal applications. In addition, the bill as",37
NA,amended streamlines and simplifies the pro-,37
NA,cedures governing the conduct of these sorts,37
NA,of matters in the commission.,37
NA,"Most especially, the bill establishes a gen-",37
NA,eral three-month probationary period for new,37
NA,employees during which the provisions of,37
NA,the unfair dismissal legislation will not ap-,37
NA,ply. This three-month probationary period,37
NA,will apply generally to all businesses. I,37
NA,should point out to the House that this par-,37
NA,ticular government amendment was based on,37
NA,"the legislation in Queensland, and I under-",37
NA,stand that this part of the legislation in,37
NA,Queensland was introduced by the Beattie,37
NA,Labor government.,37
NA,In commending the bill as amended to the,37
NA,"House, I want to acknowledge the work of",37
NA,small business representatives in presenting,37
NA,the case for change. I particularly acknowl-,37
NA,edge the indefatigable work of Rob Bastian,37
NA,and the Council of Small Business Organisa-,37
NA,tions of Australia. I also acknowledge the,37
NA,work of the Australian Chamber of Com-,37
NA,people merce and Industry which represents very,37
NA,large numbers of small businesses in Austra-,37
NA,"lia. Obviously, my distinguished friend and",37
NA,colleague the Minister for Small Business,37
NA,has repeatedly lobbied on behalf of his port-,37
NA,folio constituency with me and with cabinet.,37
NA,"Finally, I would like to congratulate the",37
NA,Senate on the work it has done with this bill.,37
NA,All senators adopted a constructive and in-,37
NA,telligent approach. I particularly commend,37
NA,the work of Senator Andrew Murray and the,37
NA,"Australian Democrats. Obviously, I do not",37
NA,always agree with Senator Murray and I do,37
NA,"not always agree with the Democrats, but I",37
NA,think that Senator Murray is a man of great,37
NA,goodwill and sincerity. He has the best inter-,37
NA,ests of Australian business at heart and he,37
NA,wants to do the right thing by workers. He,37
NA,wants to try to ensure that the rights of work-,37
NA,ers and the rights of employers are balanced,37
NA,so that both workers and employers can go,37
NA,forward in the sort of partnership that will be,37
NA,best for our economy and our society.,37
NA,"I do not believe that this bill, even as",37
NA,"amended, represents the last word in im-",37
NA,proving the unfair dismissal regime. Cer-,37
NA,"tainly, the government would prefer to see",37
NA,the sort of legislation that we have brought,37
NA,forward previously in this place and in an-,37
NA,"other place to be passed, but I accept that, in",37
NA,"the parliament as currently constituted, that",37
NA,is most unlikely. It is important that we,37
NA,should celebrate the progress that has been,37
NA,made rather than dwell on the things that,37
NA,might yet remain to be done. This Workplace,37
NA,Relations Amendment (Termination of Em-,37
NA,ployment) Bill 2000 is a sign of this gov-,37
NA,ernment's determination to do everything it,37
NA,reasonably can to boost employment. It is a,37
NA,sign of our determination to help small busi-,37
NA,ness to create jobs. (Time expired),37
Mr BEVIS ,Brisbane) (12.18 p.m.)-We,38
NA,will not be supporting the amendments to the,38
NA,Workplace Relations Amendment (Termina-,38
NA,tion of Employment) Bill 2000 which have,38
NA,been agreed to in the Senate and to which the,38
NA,minister has just referred. I want to comment,38
NA,"on the background to all of this, as I have",38
NA,"done on other occasions when this bill, and",38
NA,"bills of its kind, have been before parliament",38
NA,dealing with unfair dismissal laws.,38
NA,The laws the parliament is proposing to,38
NA,amend are the laws that this government put,38
NA,in place. They are the third generation of,38
NA,unfair dismissal laws in the federal jurisdic-,38
NA,tion. Unfair dismissal law is a longstanding,38
NA,and common practice in state jurisdictions,38
NA,around Australian industrial relations. It has,38
NA,a much shorter history in the federal juris-,38
NA,diction. The laws in the federal jurisdiction,38
NA,were first introduced by the former Labor,38
NA,"government and, prior to the 1996 election,",38
NA,Labor recognised that the laws we put in,38
NA,place were not functioning as we had in-,38
NA,tended. We made a number of quite signifi-,38
NA,cant changes to those laws that addressed,38
NA,many of the concerns that had been raised,38
NA,"with us, particularly by some in business",38
NA,"and, indeed, some in government.",38
NA,This government was elected in 1996 and,38
NA,made sweeping changes to those laws. That,38
NA,was the first wave of legislation introduced,38
NA,"by the then minister, Peter Reith. Amongst",38
NA,those sweeping changes were significant,38
NA,changes to the way in which unfair dismissal,38
NA,laws operate under federal jurisdiction. I,38
NA,want to remind parliament of what the min-,38
NA,"ister of the day, Peter Reith, said when refer-",38
NA,ring to exactly these unfair dismissal laws we,38
NA,"are now talking about. In 1996, he told par-",38
NA,liament:,38
NA,We have delivered a workable system for dealing,38
NA,with unfair dismissal on the basis of a fair,38
NA,round.,38
NA,‘A fair go all round' is how he described this,38
NA,government's laws that they now want to,38
NA,"change. At the time, we took the view that",38
NA,"the government's laws went too far, but the",38
NA,government argued that they were a fair go,38
NA,all round. They now propose to change the,38
NA,"system that they said was a fair go all round,",38
NA,to tilt the playing field more heavily in fa-,38
NA,"vour of employers, and to provide fewer",38
NA,protections to employees. Remember that the,38
NA,starting point for the adjustment is a system,38
NA,this government introduced which they said,38
NA,was ‘a fair go all round'.,38
NA,We should understand that these amend-,38
NA,ments are about changing that ‘fair go all,38
NA,round'-and those are not my words; they,38
NA,are Minister Reith's words-so that workers,38
NA,have less of a fair go all round. We do not,38
NA,"support that. In saying that, I want to place",38
NA,on the record our view that there are changes,38
NA,that are warranted in the operation of unfair,38
NA,"dismissal laws. There is a problem, particu-",38
NA,larly about time delays in the processing of,38
NA,"unfair dismissal laws, which is a burden both",38
NA,for the company and for the worker seeking,38
NA,to have a case heard. On many occasions it,38
NA,can be a problem for a worker engaged to,38
NA,replace the one who has been dismissed. It is,38
NA,in everybody's interest that these matters are,38
NA,"dealt with quickly. Unfortunately, the current",38
NA,system does not facilitate that. We have seen,38
NA,unfair dismissal cases run for more than two,38
NA,years and that is a very unsatisfactory situa-,38
NA,tion. Justice delayed is justice denied and,38
NA,that has been the case too often in unfair,38
NA,dismissal applications. So we need to do,38
NA,something about that.,38
NA,We recognise also that there is a problem,38
NA,with the ambulance chasers that are so often,38
NA,referred to. We need to understand that this is,38
NA,not a problem peculiar to unfair dismissal,38
NA,"law, nor is it peculiar to industrial relations",38
NA,law. Anyone who is involved in commercial,38
NA,or legal negotiations will tell you that. If one,38
NA,side think they have the leverage to extract,38
NA,"something from the other, they will give it a",38
NA,go. It is not just in industrial law; it is not,38
NA,just in unfair dismissal law. People will be,38
NA,presented with the dilemma: ‘Do I defend,38
NA,"this case, which I do not think is meritori-",38
NA,"go all ous? If I defend it, it is going to cost me",38
NA,more money than if I simply settled out of,38
NA,court.' That is the problem of the ambulance,38
NA,chasers in unfair dismissal law. I understand,38
NA,that and I do not like it.,38
NA,Let us not kid ourselves. It is not created,38
NA,by unions or workers; it is not created by,38
NA,unfair dismissal laws; it is created by an at-,38
NA,titude amongst the legal profession. I happily,38
NA,stand here and say that I am not a lawyer-,38
NA,and I have upset lawyers on both sides of the,38
NA,House with that comment! (Extension of time,39
NA,"granted) But it happens to be the case that, in",39
NA,a whole range of areas of the operations of,39
NA,"the law, that sort of behaviour is common-",39
NA,place. If you can press the advantage and get,39
NA,"a claim settled out of court, you do it. Of",39
NA,"course that happens, and that is a concern to",39
NA,us. We have been looking at remedies to that,39
NA,"and, indeed, discussing them with various",39
NA,stakeholders. I made the comment to them,39
NA,that I make in this parliament now: the,39
NA,remedies that are proposed to deal with that,39
NA,create problems that are just as bad as the,39
NA,problem they seek to overcome.,39
NA,"On that point, I think it is worth having a",39
NA,look at the comments that the Democrats,39
NA,made on this in their report on the second,39
NA,"wave legislation. This bill, of course, has its",39
NA,genesis in the second wave legislation. It is,39
NA,an extract from that second wave bill. In re-,39
NA,lation to these specific provisions that were,39
NA,in the second wave bill that have now been,39
NA,"separated out, the Democrats said:",39
NA,... It is in the interests of all parties concerned,39
NA,"with unfair dismissals, if the Commission's proc-",39
NA,esses are made as quick and inexpensive as is,39
NA,"consistent with the needs of justice, and if the",39
NA,process of law does not become manipulative.,39
NA,I agree with that. My concern is that they,39
NA,have the balance wrong with these amend-,39
NA,ments. They have not ensured that both effi-,39
NA,"ciency and effectiveness, as well as justice,",39
NA,are being applied here.,39
NA,The bill before us is markedly different,39
NA,from that which the government proposed.,39
NA,"The Senate, thankfully, had the wisdom to",39
NA,extract a range of matters out of this bill,39
NA,which did not have the support of the other,39
NA,parties in the Senate. They include provi-,39
NA,sions that would have excluded contractors,39
NA,"from the legislation, that would have re-",39
NA,stricted access to extend time to lodge appli-,39
NA,cations as they currently exist and that would,39
NA,"have prohibited compensation for shock,",39
NA,distress or humiliation. The workers in Aus-,39
NA,"tralia are entitled to ask, ‘Why does the gov-",39
NA,ernment actually want to reduce the rights,39
NA,that we presently have? Why does the gov-,39
NA,ernment want to prevent us being paid even,39
NA,"when the court feels we should?' Remember,",39
NA,this is where a court hears the facts and de-,39
NA,"cides that the worker has suffered shock,",39
NA,distress or humiliation and as a result of that,39
NA,"is entitled to some payment, but the govern-",39
NA,ment actually wants to write that out of the,39
NA,law.,39
NA,"Thankfully, the Senate took those provi-",39
NA,sions and a number of others that the gov-,39
NA,ernment was seeking out of the bill. But we,39
NA,have heard here today from the minister his,39
NA,desire to see further changes in the law. I,39
NA,assume by that he means to see those things,39
NA,that were in the government's bill pursued in,39
NA,the future. So we now know the agenda for,39
NA,the next election from this government. It is,39
NA,to strip those things from workers in relation,39
NA,to the entitlements they currently have under,39
NA,the law relating to unfair dismissal. I assure,39
NA,the minister that we will make certain that,39
NA,the workers of Australia are aware of those,39
NA,additional changes the government wishes to,39
NA,make to further strip entitlements from em-,39
NA,ployees.,39
NA,I want to talk specifically now about the,39
NA,amendments made in the Senate with the,39
NA,support of the Democrats. We did in fact,39
NA,vote for a number of these amendments in,39
NA,the Senate with the Democrats. We took the,39
NA,"view that, if there was going to be a bill",39
NA,"passed through this parliament, it was better",39
NA,that it be a bill improved on the govern-,39
NA,"ment's version, even if we did not like the",39
NA,final product. We supported a number of,39
NA,these amendments and subsequently sought,39
NA,"to defeat the bill as a whole. As it turns out,",39
NA,"it is just as well we did, otherwise the work-",39
NA,ers of Australia would not even have had,39
NA,these small mercies to be thankful for.,39
NA,"The Democrats in the Senate proposed,",39
NA,"and had accepted, the following changes.",39
NA,"Firstly, where at the conciliation stage it has",39
NA,been indicated by the commission that the,39
NA,applicant has no reasonable prospect of suc-,39
NA,"cess at arbitration, the application must be",39
NA,dismissed. I can understand why the Demo-,39
NA,crats proposed that. It goes to some of the,39
NA,questions of meritorious claims and the am-,39
NA,bulance chasers and the like. That will pro-,39
NA,duce a requirement that the full case will be,39
NA,run up front. There will no longer be a two-,39
NA,stage process under this arrangement. We,39
NA,will now have the full case dealt with up,39
NA,"front, and that is not going to expedite mat-",39
NA,ters. Those cases that could easily have been,39
NA,"sorted out in the first tier of this process,",40
NA,"quite simply, are now going to be prolonged",40
NA,because no-one will be able to take the gam-,40
NA,ble that you might have an adverse finding at,40
NA,that stage. You will have to run the full case,40
NA,up front. This will slow the process down. It,40
NA,will have the opposite effect to that which,40
NA,the Democrats and the government seek.,40
NA,(Extension of time granted),40
NA,The second Democrats amendment I want,40
NA,"to refer to is that, in considering whether a",40
NA,"termination was unfair, the commission con-",40
NA,siders the degree to which the size of the,40
NA,employer's business would be likely to im-,40
NA,pact on the procedures followed. There is a,40
NA,fundamental problem with this. What we are,40
NA,"saying as a parliament, what the government",40
NA,"is saying and what the Democrats have said,",40
NA,is that you have two sets of rights as a,40
NA,worker. You can be in one company and the,40
NA,"facts of the case are absolutely identical,",40
NA,cept that company A employs five or 10,40
NA,people and company B employs 50 or 60-,40
NA,that is the only distinguishing feature-but,40
NA,your rights are different in those two places,40
NA,because of the operation of this new provi-,40
NA,sion. That is a fundamental undermining of,40
NA,basic judicial principles. It is wrong. We,40
NA,should not be saying that workers will be,40
NA,"treated differently, solely because of how",40
NA,many people happen to work at their work-,40
NA,"place, when their cases are heard.",40
NA,I also alert the government to the problem,40
NA,that I think is going to occur as companies,40
NA,reconstruct themselves. We already have,40
NA,many examples of companies that operate in,40
NA,the one location but actually use an umbrella,40
NA,of organisations that may all be owned by the,40
NA,"same people. It happens. In fact, Joy Manu-",40
NA,"facturing, where there was a major industrial",40
NA,"dispute, had a number of companies operat-",40
NA,ing on the one site. The workers all wore the,40
NA,"same uniform, they all thought they were",40
NA,"working for the same company, but in fact",40
NA,they were working for a range of different,40
NA,companies. There is nothing to stop an or-,40
NA,ganisation establishing that structure and,40
NA,employing five people in every one of them.,40
NA,Instead of having one company with 50 peo-,40
NA,"ple, there are 10 different companies and",40
NA,"they all employ just five, who all wear the",40
NA,same uniform. They all trade under the same,40
NA,"name, the customers all come to the same",40
NA,"place; but, technically, the workers are em-",40
NA,ployed by different organisations. The mo-,40
NA,ment you introduce that distinction into these,40
NA,laws you invite that activity-and you do not,40
NA,have to invite it too much because it already,40
NA,occurs for tax purposes and for other rea-,40
NA,sons. The government is going to confront,40
NA,"that situation. But, sadly, the people who will",40
NA,pay the cost will be the workers.,40
NA,The third amendment I will refer to is the,40
NA,change that lawyers and other representatives,40
NA,must disclose whether or not they have a,40
NA,costs arrangement or contingency fee agree-,40
NA,"ment-that is, no win, no pay. Why are we",40
NA,doing this? If the law is supposed to deter-,40
NA,mine matters before it on the facts of the,40
NA,"case, why should the financial arrangement",40
NA,between the client and the lawyer be a,40
NA,ground for determining whether or not the,40
NA,excase should succeed? This is an absurd prin-,40
NA,ciple that we do not apply anywhere else in,40
NA,the legal system. But when it comes to work-,40
NA,"ers' rights for reinstatement, we introduce",40
NA,it-only here do we introduce it-to strip,40
NA,away one of the arguments that workers have,40
NA,available to them.,40
NA,"The inference, of course, is that if a",40
NA,"worker-who, by the way, has just lost their",40
NA,"job, so the chances are they do not have a lot",40
NA,of money and certainly have no income,40
NA,stream for the future-gets offered the op-,40
NA,portunity to have their case taken by a law-,40
NA,"yer on a no win, no pay situation, that is less",40
NA,meritorious than if they had a big bank ac-,40
NA,count and could afford to pay the lawyer up,40
NA,"front in a trust fund. What an absurd, class",40
NA,"based, elitist attitude that is. But that is what",40
NA,the parliament is being asked to support by,40
NA,this government. A factor determining the,40
NA,merits is now whether you are rich enough to,40
NA,pay the lawyer and put the money into their,40
NA,trust fund up front. This really is chequebook,40
NA,judicial behaviour. This is disgraceful. Of all,40
NA,the amendments the government proposes to,40
NA,make and that the Democrats have sup-,40
NA,"ported, this one is the most offensive. I am",40
NA,actually surprised that the Democrats have,40
NA,given it their support.,40
NA,I want to mention two other amendments,40
NA,quickly-I hope not to prolong the debate,40
NA,much further. One is the prohibition on ad-,40
NA,visers encouraging applicants to make or,41
NA,"pursue a claim where they were, or should",41
NA,"have been, aware that it had no reasonable",41
NA,"prospect of success, for which the govern-",41
NA,"ment now intend to impose a fine of $10,000",41
NA,"on the body corporate or $2,000 on the indi-",41
NA,"vidual. Again, this is a mechanism that, as",41
NA,"far as I am aware, is unknown in the rest of",41
NA,the legal system. (Extension of time granted),41
NA,We do not actually fine advisers in any other,41
NA,jurisdiction I am aware of because they hap-,41
NA,pen to have lost the case. They may have to,41
NA,"pay costs in some jurisdictions, but that is",41
NA,not what we are talking about here. We are,41
NA,actually talking about fining them because,41
NA,they lost the case. Someone is going to de-,41
NA,cide: you should have known you were going,41
NA,"to lose the case, so you should not have",41
NA,fronted up in the first place. This is a stacked,41
NA,deck. This government have loaded the dice,41
NA,so that when a worker takes a case for unfair,41
NA,dismissal the odds are well and truly stacked,41
NA,against them. And not only are the odds,41
NA,stacked against them because we have,41
NA,changed the rules on how it is going to be,41
NA,"decided; if you happen to lose, not only are",41
NA,"you not going to get your job back, not only",41
NA,"are you not going to get any money, not only",41
NA,"may you face costs, but your advisers may be",41
NA,fined as well.,41
NA,Follow through the implications of this.,41
NA,People are going to be required to give up,41
NA,their assets to pay costs. For a lot of workers,41
NA,"in this situation, their assets are the house",41
NA,and car and a bit of furniture-that is it. So,41
NA,what are we going to take from them? Are,41
NA,"we going to take the car from them? Well,",41
NA,that will be helpful for them in finding an-,41
NA,other job-they will not have transport. That,41
NA,is good. Or are we going to take the furniture,41
NA,out of the house or sell up the house? Or are,41
NA,we going to put them in jail? We will put,41
NA,them in jail because they had the audacity to,41
NA,go before the courts and argue they had been,41
NA,unfairly sacked. That is the application of the,41
NA,combination of these things.,41
NA,"We acknowledge, as I said at the outset,",41
NA,that there is a problem with ambulance chas-,41
NA,ers and there is a problem with time delays.,41
NA,The time delay issue is not addressed in this,41
NA,bill at all. But to the extent that the Demo-,41
NA,crats have sought to fix the problem associ-,41
NA,"ated with ambulance chasers, they have not",41
NA,fixed it; what they have done is create an-,41
NA,other set of problems that is greater than the,41
NA,one they set out to solve. We will not be a,41
NA,party to doing that. We opposed this in the,41
NA,Senate and we will oppose the bill here in the,41
NA,"House of Representatives. I look forward,",41
NA,"early next year in government, to bringing",41
NA,forward to the parliament a bill to put some,41
NA,decency back into these arrangements and to,41
NA,address the issue the government have failed,41
NA,"to look at-the problem of time delays-and,",41
NA,"in consultation with the stakeholders, to deal",41
NA,more fairly with the issue of ambulance,41
NA,chasers.,41
NA,I again remind the House: let us not kid,41
NA,ourselves about the practice of ambulance,41
NA,chasers. It is not unique to unfair dismissals;,41
NA,it is not unique to industrial law. And I sus-,41
NA,"pect that, when the legal profession find a",41
NA,nice set of rules or practices to overcome that,41
NA,"problem generically, at that point, and not",41
NA,"before, we will overcome the problem in",41
NA,industrial relations. But we should not be,41
NA,"trying to address that in an isolated fashion,",41
NA,particularly when to do it in the way this,41
NA,government proposes to do it denies ordinary,41
NA,workers the limited rights they currently,41
NA,"have. Those limited rights, made available",41
NA,"by Peter Reith's first wave of IR laws, were",41
NA,"in themselves not overly generous. Today,",41
NA,the parliament proposes to take away some,41
NA,of those limited rights. We will divide on the,41
NA,bill when the debate reaches that point and,41
NA,we will oppose it.,41
Mrs CROSIO ,Prospect) (12.38 p.m.)-I,41
NA,too would like to rise and consider the,41
NA,"amendments in the House today. In fact,",41
NA,when I relooked at when the Workplace Re-,41
NA,lations Amendment (Termination of Em-,41
NA,ployment) Bill 2000 first came into the,41
NA,"House, I found that it was something I spoke",41
NA,"about in September last year, so here we are",41
NA,nearly 12 months later discovering that we,41
NA,are still trying to rectify some of the anoma-,41
NA,lies existing in this bill. Having this minister,41
NA,now in control of industrial relations is like,41
NA,having Dracula in charge of the blood bank.,41
NA,"We cannot expect any sympathy, we cannot",41
NA,"expect any thoroughness and, more impor-",41
NA,"tantly, we cannot expect any sympathetic",41
NA,consideration of what workers are on about,41
NA,out there in the real world. This is really a,42
NA,"no-frills version of the ‘more jobs, better",42
NA,pay' bill that was put up by the previous,42
NA,"minister. When you look at that bill, and then",42
NA,consider the debate that took place in the,42
NA,Senate on the amendments that we are now,42
NA,"debating, you understand and appreciate",42
NA,where we are really coming from. The gov-,42
NA,ernment are really about driving a stake into,42
NA,the heart of industrial relations. They seem,42
NA,have an absolute obsession with dismantling,42
NA,the Australian Industrial Relations Commis-,42
NA,"sion, which is really the only fair and inde-",42
NA,pendent umpire. If this government had their,42
NA,"way, believe me, we would still have eight-",42
NA,and nine-year-olds down in the coalmines or,42
NA,working in the cotton mills.,42
NA,"I say to the Minister for Employment,",42
NA,"Workplace Relations and Small Business,",42
NA,"who is at the table: Minister, you have got to",42
NA,wake up. We are now in the 21st century.,42
NA,This minister seems to be an absolute clone,42
NA,of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister in,42
NA,"1992, when he was Liberal spokesman for",42
NA,"industrial relations, said-and I say it again;",42
NA,he has never denied it: it is there in the,42
NA,ord-‘We in the Liberal coalition would like,42
NA,to stab the commission in the stomach.' And,42
NA,that is what we seem to be doing eight or,42
NA,nine years later. The government are trying,42
NA,to have another crack at it; they are making,42
NA,another attempt to walk over the workers to,42
NA,stab the commission in the stomach. If they,42
NA,believe that unfair dismissal is really going,42
NA,to be an issue out there with workers and,42
NA,"employers, I say again what I said last Sep-",42
NA,"tember: they have got to do their homework,",42
NA,and they have to do it well.,42
NA,Yesterday I criticised the minister at the,42
NA,table in the matter of public importance be-,42
NA,fore this House over his claim that protecting,42
NA,the entitlements of workers by a 0.1 per cent,42
NA,"charge will cost 50,000 jobs. This seems to",42
NA,be a mythical figure that the coalition gov-,42
NA,ernment repeatedly brings up. I did some,42
NA,more research and found that when Minister,42
NA,Reith was in charge of industrial relations he,42
NA,said that if we did not get rid of unfair dis-,42
NA,"missals we would lose 50,000 jobs, and that",42
NA,if we did not do something about unfair dis-,42
NA,missals we would not allow small business to,42
NA,"create 50,000 jobs. This mythical 50,000",42
NA,seems to pop up every time this government,42
NA,wants to colour the figures or colour the de-,42
NA,bate-I call it hypocrisy.,42
NA,I tried to find at least an honest survey to,42
NA,see where anyone could get these figures as,42
NA,to how many people will be disadvantaged. I,42
NA,could not find any. The only paper I could,42
NA,find that had surveyed small businesses em-,42
NA,ploying workers out there in some of the ar-,42
NA,to eas I was concerned about was a University,42
NA,of Newcastle paper in 1999 which says that,42
NA,less than half of their respondents found un-,42
NA,fair dismissal laws influenced them in any,42
NA,way whatsoever when hiring their people. I,42
NA,then found another survey done in May,42
NA,2000-the Telstra Yellow Pages Small Busi-,42
NA,ness Index-where it asked the question of,42
NA,"more than 1,200 small business owners, and,",42
NA,"from the replies, 44 per cent of small busi-",42
NA,nesses believed there were no barriers what-,42
NA,"soever and, of the 56 per cent who believed",42
NA,there were barriers to taking on new employ-,42
NA,"ees, 39 per cent believed the major barrier",42
NA,"was that there was not enough work, 19 per",42
NA,"cent mentioned the cost of employing them,",42
NA,rec12 per cent said that finding skilled labour,42
NA,"and staff was a barrier, eight per cent said the",42
NA,"lack of cash flow, and eight per cent said the",42
NA,introduction of the GST. There was no men-,42
NA,"tion, in the only two surveys I have been able",42
NA,"to find in that respect, that if we can get rid",42
NA,of unfair dismissals it will create lots of jobs,42
NA,in industry at large. I am saying to the gov-,42
NA,ernment through the minister: if we are going,42
NA,to have figures floated around to be used as a,42
NA,basis for amendments or for this particular,42
NA,"bill to become law, then let us have some",42
NA,factual figures and let us not be so hypocriti-,42
NA,cal in presenting this mythical figure of,42
NA,"50,000 every time someone wants to prove a",42
NA,point.,42
NA,I would also like to agree with the hon-,42
NA,"ourable member for Brisbane, our shadow",42
NA,"minister on industrial relations, on the points",42
NA,he made regarding the amendments that were,42
NA,moved in the Senate. When I first saw that,42
NA,Senator Murray was trying to move the word,42
NA,"‘reasonable', I thought that I would like any-",42
NA,one to define ‘reasonable' when we are talk-,42
NA,ing about what is going on in the amend-,42
NA,ments to the particular bill we are now de-,42
NA,bating here in the House. (Extension of time,42
NA,granted) As has been stated before by the,43
NA,honourable member for Brisbane and to my,43
NA,"knowledge-and I am no lawyer, either; I",43
NA,can only do research-there is no instance in,43
NA,the courts of Australia where a person who,43
NA,has lost a case will not only then be asked to,43
NA,pay costs but will also be fined. Yet we are,43
NA,"saying to individuals, ‘If we believe that you",43
NA,"have no right of winning that case, you will",43
NA,"be fined $2,000 before you even have the",43
NA,"right to present it'- with a fine of $10,000",43
NA,for a company. This is quite unfair. I really,43
NA,believe there has to be a lot more fairness in,43
NA,"action in some sections of the bill, particu-",43
NA,larly in the amendments. I reiterate that the,43
NA,"Democrat amendments, looking at the con-",43
NA,"ciliation stage, ask the commission to indi-",43
NA,cate when an applicant has no reasonable,43
NA,"prospect of success. I say to you, Mr Deputy",43
NA,"Speaker, and to the minister: who decides",43
NA,that? The case is before the commission. The,43
NA,Democrat amendment says that at the con-,43
NA,ciliation stage it has to be indicated by the,43
NA,commission if the applicant has no reason-,43
NA,able prospect of success. It is almost Caesar,43
NA,judging Caesar. The applicant is going before,43
NA,"the commission to plead a case, and now the",43
NA,"commission has to say, ‘At the conciliation",43
NA,"stage, if I feel you are not going to win the",43
NA,case I am not going to allow you to proceed,43
NA,with the case.' I think we have to examine,43
NA,that a little bit further.,43
NA,"As I mentioned before, with fines of",43
NA,"$2,000 for an individual in the case of",43
NA,"breaching, how can you tell them they",43
NA,should have been aware they had no reason-,43
NA,able prospect of success? When people you,43
NA,represent-especially people in an electorate,43
NA,"like mine- have been unfairly dismissed,",43
NA,"how can you say to them, ‘You have to be",43
NA,sure in your own mind that you are going to,43
NA,"pursue this claim, because you are going to",43
NA,be fined if you have no reasonable prospect,43
NA,"of success.' In other words, we would be",43
NA,"saying to them, ‘Whatever you do, just take",43
NA,it. Don't try. Don't appeal.' We may have a,43
NA,"lawful process but, because of this govern-",43
NA,ment's industrial relations bills and because,43
NA,of what they are trying to do in the industrial,43
NA,"relations field, we will have to say to those",43
NA,people who feel they have a right to make a,43
NA,"claim, ‘Don't do it. It'll be too hard for you.",43
NA,We're not going to give you the encourage-,43
NA,ment that you should have.' More impor-,43
NA,"tantly, we are denying workers their rights.",43
NA,Who are we to say whether or not they have,43
NA,that right? Only the Industrial Relations,43
NA,Commission has that right.,43
NA,I am concerned that if this bill goes,43
NA,through with these amendments in their pre-,43
NA,sent form we will have taken a backward,43
NA,step. We thought we were going into the 21st,43
NA,"century with social changes, that is, consid-",43
NA,eration of the rights of workers. This gov-,43
NA,"ernment, no matter what we see or hear from",43
NA,"them, and no matter that they have changed",43
NA,"ministers, will not change the level at which",43
NA,they contemplate where they are going with,43
NA,these bills. It is an enormous degree of hy-,43
NA,pocrisy on the part of the government. Let,43
NA,"us, for once, have some consideration of",43
NA,"what the amendments signify and, more im-",43
NA,"portantly, some consideration of what this",43
NA,legislation signifies for the workers of Aus-,43
NA,tralia into the future. If we as legislators fail,43
NA,"them in this House, we fail as Australians.",43
Mr ANDREN ,Calare) (12.47 p.m.)-In,43
NA,the last five years I have been pretty consis-,43
NA,tent about the workplace relations legislation,43
NA,of this government. I rejected the workplace,43
NA,legislation in its original form when it came,43
NA,"into this House back in 1996, but in that de-",43
NA,bate I said that the unfair dismissal law was a,43
NA,disincentive to employment. As far as small,43
NA,employers throughout my electorate are con-,43
NA,cerned I have found that to be a continuing,43
NA,situation. In this debate-and in it there have,43
NA,been extremes from both ends of the spec-,43
NA,trum-we have to start talking about mutual,43
NA,"trust in the employment market, particularly",43
NA,in regard to small business. We know the,43
NA,impact of the GST on small business and we,43
NA,know the impact of other regulatory changes,43
NA,on small business. I certainly know of the,43
NA,impact on small business of the GST and I,43
NA,"know, too, of the negative impact that the",43
NA,unfair dismissal regime has on employers,43
NA,and indeed employees in my electorate.,43
NA,If we are to overcome the partisan and ad-,43
NA,versarial approach to industrial relations we,43
NA,must get away from this Left-Right nexus-,43
NA,the ideological positions that both sides,43
NA,take-and look at the actual job situation.,43
NA,"For instance, I had a case in my electorate a",43
NA,couple of years ago of a recently hired per-,43
NA,son who was looking after the phones in a,44
NA,particular company. The circumstance was,44
NA,that that person ran into a huge personality,44
NA,conflict with the manager. That person then,44
NA,"proceeded to, if you like, undermine the",44
NA,"credibility of the employer and, indeed, her",44
NA,work colleagues. That situation was unten-,44
NA,able. I believe that within an organisation,44
NA,with 15 or fewer employees we should not,44
NA,have a situation where the employee is able,44
NA,to march into that workplace in almost an,44
NA,adversarial role; nor should the employer be,44
NA,armed with the means of taking that person,44
NA,through a legal process or dismissing them,44
NA,on the spot. Where 15 or fewer employees,44
NA,are working in a small manufacturing plant,44
NA,"or in commercial premises, unless there is",44
NA,that mutual trust it is not going to be a very,44
NA,productive workplace anyway. That is the,44
NA,message I am getting from employers in my,44
NA,seat of Calare.,44
NA,I said back in March this year that in 1996,44
NA,I had no problems with a bill that exempts,44
NA,from the unfair dismissal provisions busi-,44
NA,nesses employing no more than 15 workers. I,44
NA,feel the same way now. Such workers are,44
NA,always to be protected by the unlawful dis-,44
NA,missal provisions which include dismissal,44
NA,for discriminatory reasons such as sexual,44
NA,"preference, age, union membership and fam-",44
NA,"ily responsibilities. I said then, and I see",44
NA,reason to change my view after talking to,44
NA,"small business operators, that unfair dis-",44
NA,missal legislation is a disincentive,44
NA,pansion of employment opportunities. I am,44
NA,also aware that this government-and no,44
NA,doubt future ones-will use employment and,44
NA,unemployment figures to their political ad-,44
NA,vantage. It is a nonsense to speak only of,44
NA,unemployment figures as a sign of economic,44
NA,health. One needs to work only an hour a,44
NA,week to not appear on those stats.,44
NA,Many employees in rural and regional ar-,44
NA,"eas, and no doubt in city areas, are cobbling",44
NA,together a portfolio of part-time and casual,44
NA,jobs to make ends meet. We must protect,44
NA,their work conditions; we must protect them,44
NA,in all ways-through representative union,44
NA,"membership, if that is their choice. Indeed,",44
NA,recent days we have seen the effectiveness of,44
NA,arguing that position on behalf of employees.,44
NA,"But I honestly believe that, unless we have",44
NA,"mutual trust in those small, micro businesses",44
NA,"and employment situations, with employers",44
NA,armed with lawyers and employees with no,44
NA,"resources to access lawyers, this three",44
NA,months is reasonable. I accept the amend-,44
NA,ments to the Workplace Relations Amend-,44
NA,ment (Termination of Employment) Bill,44
NA,2000 that have been passed by the Senate.,44
NA,(Time expired),44
Mr HORNE ,Paterson) (12.52 p.m.)-Be-,44
NA,"fore I came into the House today, I noticed",44
NA,on my computer that the job figures have just,44
NA,been released. They indicate that there is no,44
NA,growth in unemployment in Australia. Un-,44
NA,employment stays constant at 6.9 per cent.,44
NA,"However, what they show is that the agenda",44
NA,"of this government is well and truly on track,",44
NA,and that the number of full-time permanent,44
NA,jobs has decreased and the casualisation of,44
NA,Australian workers has increased. That is the,44
NA,agenda of this government: this government,44
NA,knows that the problem we are talking about,44
NA,today does not relate to casual workers and,44
NA,that is why this government encourages the,44
NA,casualisation of Australia's work force. That,44
NA,is the tragedy that is befalling many Austra-,44
NA,lian workers. That is the uncertainty that is,44
NA,being built into the life pattern of many,44
NA,young Australian families in particular: they,44
NA,cannot make a commitment to the future of,44
NA,"no this country, they cannot make a commit-",44
NA,"ment to the future of their families, because",44
NA,"they are not guaranteed a job next week, next",44
NA,"to the exmonth, next year.",44
NA,The other point I would like to make is,44
NA,about Job Network. The Minister for Em-,44
NA,"ployment, Workplace Relations and Small",44
NA,"Business, who is at the table, often gets up",44
NA,and reminds us that as far as this government,44
NA,is concerned 15 hours of paid work is a job.,44
NA,Fifteen hours of paid work is what this gov-,44
NA,ernment will fund a Job Network provider,44
NA,"for, as long as they can get a person 15",44
NA,hours. It is not a question of whether they,44
NA,can find them a job on which they can earn,44
NA,"their living, on which they can survive, and",44
NA,nor are the statistics that give us the 6.9 per,44
NA,cent unemployment based on such criteria.,44
NA,in Surely anyone in the work force that has a,44
NA,job has a right to expect that they can survive,44
NA,"on that job, that they can be independent and",44
NA,that it will upkeep them and give them a,44
NA,"standard of living. Of course, that is not what",45
NA,the government claims at all. This govern-,45
NA,"ment says, ‘Fifteen hours of work is a job,",45
NA,and we will pay a Job Network provider as,45
NA,long as they can get that amount of work for,45
NA,someone that has been unemployed.',45
NA,The Steel Tank and Pipe Company in,45
NA,Newcastle is one of those companies that,45
NA,went belly-up last year. The 200 workers had,45
NA,to fight for their entitlements. Of course they,45
NA,missed out on them. I always find it inter-,45
NA,esting that it is the workers that have to,45
NA,for their entitlements and it is this govern-,45
NA,ment that forces the workers to fight for their,45
NA,"entitlements. It should be the reverse, be-",45
NA,cause in my opinion what happened to those,45
NA,workers was quite criminal. They were trans-,45
NA,ferred in employment from their original,45
NA,employing company to a number of shelf,45
NA,companies that were only shells-they had,45
NA,no cash and no material. When the day came,45
NA,"when the workers were told, ‘Sorry, there is",45
NA,"no more work,' there was absolutely no sub-",45
NA,stance to the company that was employing,45
NA,"them. The plant, the equipment, the land-all",45
NA,"the property-was held by another company,",45
NA,not the employing company. Do we hear,45
NA,anything from this government in defence of,45
NA,"the workers in that situation? No, not one jot.",45
NA,Yet what happened to those workers Steel,45
NA,"Tank and Pipe Company in my opinion, as I",45
NA,"said, is quite criminal, quite abhorrent to",45
NA,"every Australian except this minister, who",45
NA,had absolutely nothing to say on it.,45
NA,Workplace relations is the most important,45
NA,foundation on which to build any nation. We,45
NA,want families out there to have confidence in,45
NA,"the future of this country, to have the confi-",45
NA,dence to go out and build a house whether,45
NA,"they get $14,000 or not. They can only do so",45
NA,if they know with some security that they,45
NA,"have a job, that they have a place in Austra-",45
NA,lia's work force. It is the responsibility of,45
NA,government to ensure that that security is,45
NA,there. All we see from this government is,45
NA,that security being reduced at every occa-,45
NA,sion. That is why we should oppose it. (Time,45
NA,expired),45
Mr MCCLELLAND ,Barton) (12.57,45
NA,p.m.)-The first point of real concern is what,45
NA,the Workplace Relations Amendment (Ter-,45
NA,mination of Employment) Bill 2000 means,45
NA,to the employment security of average work-,45
NA,"ers, in particular workers in a number of in-",45
NA,"dustries that are facing significant structural,",45
NA,"economic change-in particular, the manu-",45
NA,"facturing industry. We note, for instance, that",45
NA,the Democrat amendments took out an,45
NA,"amendment to section 170CG, by removing",45
NA,the words which had prevented unfair dis-,45
NA,missal actions in circumstances which in-,45
NA,volved the operational requirements of the,45
NA,"employer's undertaking, establishment or",45
NA,fight service. But in the amendments that have,45
NA,"come in, it is proposed to add an additional",45
NA,term in section 170CG(d) to prevent unfair,45
NA,dismissal actions relating to the operational,45
NA,"requirements of the employer's undertaking,",45
NA,"establishment or service, unless the circum-",45
NA,stances are exceptional.,45
NA,What are going to be the exceptional cir-,45
NA,cumstances? That is so vague as to be all but,45
NA,"useless. Already, as a result of the govern-",45
NA,ment's inclusion in section 89A of the Work-,45
NA,place Relations Act that issues relating to,45
NA,redundancy cannot be included in awards-,45
NA,"that is, there can be no requirement placed in",45
NA,industrial awards compelling employers to,45
NA,negotiate with workers or their unions prior,45
NA,to dismissal in circumstances of redun-,45
NA,dancy-workers are left with the situation,45
NA,where it is only in an enterprise agreement or,45
NA,perhaps an Australian workplace agreement,45
NA,that they could prescribe a procedure in re-,45
NA,spect of dismissal as a result of technological,45
NA,"change or economic decline. However, there",45
NA,are authorities that the Federal Court cannot,45
NA,"grant injunctive relief-or, in other words,",45
NA,specific performance-of those sorts of pro-,45
NA,visions.,45
NA,"Effectively, when this bill goes through,",45
NA,workers who are sacked because of the op-,45
NA,erational requirements of the business-that,45
NA,"is, because of restructuring, technological",45
NA,change or economic decline- are without,45
NA,remedy. This government is dramatically,45
NA,"hypocritical, and that stands out starkly.",45
NA,Australian workers have had a bomb explode,45
NA,at their feet today courtesy of this minister. I,45
NA,"do not think, with respect to the minister and",45
NA,"his department, that he has thought that",45
NA,through. This is a matter of real concern to,45
NA,the job security of ordinary Australian work-,45
NA,ers.,45
NA,In the time available to me I will not have,46
NA,the opportunity to traverse the matters raised,46
NA,by the shadow minister. I think he did very,46
NA,"well, with respect to him. There is no need",46
NA,for these double standards that apply to the,46
NA,representation of workers who have lost their,46
NA,jobs. We have heard in debate during parlia-,46
NA,ment this week that if you are in or above,46
NA,your mid-40s and without tertiary education,46
NA,you are in real trouble in terms of getting,46
NA,other employment. To require the disclosure,46
NA,of contingency fee arrangements in circum-,46
NA,stances where lawyers in Australia are not,46
NA,entitled to claim a percentage of any verdict,46
NA,obtained- they can only charge their scale,46
NA,fee according to court rules-is totally un-,46
NA,necessary. To cast a reverse onus on lawyers,46
NA,to prove that their ongoing conduct of the,46
NA,litigation was justified turns completely on,46
NA,its head any concept of professional privilege,46
NA,"that has developed, because a lawyer needing",46
NA,to discharge that reverse onus would have to,46
NA,breach solicitor-client privilege. That is,46
NA,something that the legal profession generally,46
NA,should be concerned about. There is no other,46
NA,area of the law where that could even possi-,46
NA,bly be contemplated. But to do it with re-,46
NA,"spect to workers, to scapegoat workers who",46
NA,"have lost their jobs, is quite simply an out-",46
NA,rage. (Time expired),46
Mr ABBOTT ,Warringah-Minister for,46
NA,"Employment, Workplace Relations and",46
NA,Small Business) (1.02 p.m.)-I do not wish,46
NA,to prolong debate on the Workplace Rela-,46
NA,tions Amendment (Termination of Employ-,46
NA,ment) Bill 2000 but I do wish to respond,46
NA,briefly to some of the comments that have,46
NA,been made by speakers in the debate. While I,46
NA,do not agree with most of what was put by,46
NA,"opposition members, I do respect their pas-",46
NA,sion and their commitment and I thank them,46
NA,for their contributions.,46
NA,The member for Brisbane made a number,46
NA,of points. The first point he made was that,46
NA,the Senate's amendments are amendments to,46
NA,"the government's 1996 legislation, which",46
NA,was declared at the time to institute a fair go,46
NA,all round in the unfair dismissals regime. I,46
NA,certainly take the member's point. These are,46
NA,amendments to our legislation. We thought at,46
NA,"the time that our legislation was, indeed, a",46
NA,"fair go all round. The sad truth is that,",46
NA,"eration, our legislation did not work as well",46
NA,as we thought it should. That is why it,46
NA,needed some change and that is why we,46
NA,think the bill as amended by the Senate is a,46
NA,good one.,46
NA,"Secondly, the member for Brisbane said",46
NA,that the changes would mean that people,46
NA,would have to run a full case up front be-,46
NA,cause of the ability of the commission to ex-,46
NA,clude proceedings after a conciliation hear-,46
NA,ing. I think that is a reasonable point for the,46
NA,"member for Brisbane to make, but the reality",46
NA,"is that the regime as it stands has meant that,",46
NA,"after a conciliation hearing, the vast majority",46
NA,of employers have been in the situation of,46
NA,having to pay as they contemplate the cost of,46
NA,continuing. Hence the inelegant expression,46
NA,"‘piss-off money', which so many businesses",46
NA,deeply complain about having to pay.,46
NA,The third point that the member for Bris-,46
NA,"bane made was that, as a result of changes in",46
NA,"this bill, workers would be employed by dif-",46
NA,ferent entities. The provisions of this bill,46
NA,requiring the commission to take into ac-,46
NA,count the different circumstances of small,46
NA,business do not go to the substantive law. We,46
NA,are not talking here about a different law,46
NA,applying to small business when it comes to,46
NA,unfair dismissals; we are simply talking,46
NA,about the consideration that the commission,46
NA,should give to small business in the conduct,46
NA,of these hearings.,46
NA,The fourth point that the member for,46
NA,"Brisbane made was that the no win, no fee",46
NA,disclosure was oppressive. I should point out,46
NA,in response that there is no requirement un-,46
NA,der the bill for the commission to take any,46
NA,judicial notice of this. It is simply the gov-,46
NA,ernment's view that it is relevant and it,46
NA,should be on the public record.,46
NA,The final point that the member for Bris-,46
NA,bane made was that the commission's ability,46
NA,to impose fines for unmeritorious cases is an,46
NA,unjust imposition on people in trouble. Let,46
NA,me just reassure the member for Brisbane on,46
NA,that point by stressing that these fines can be,46
NA,"imposed on lawyers and their advisers, not",46
NA,on applicants in this case.,46
NA,"As I said, I do not wish to prolong the de-",46
NA,bate. I certainly do not wish to impugn the,46
NA,in opmotives or the commitment of members op-,46
NA,posite who made the points they did in the,47
NA,"debate. I think, if I may say so, that their",47
NA,"concerns are misplaced, because I have con-",47
NA,siderable confidence in the ability of the,47
NA,commission to handle this new regime fairly.,47
NA,I think the commission comprises decent,47
NA,Australians who are determined to do the,47
NA,"right thing by all Australians, but particularly",47
NA,by working Australians. I do not believe that,47
NA,this regime will be interpreted in ways which,47
NA,are harmful to the workers of Australia. So I,47
NA,"commend the bill, as amended, to the House.",47
NA,Question put:,47
NA,That the Senate's amendments be agreed to.,47

NA,ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT,47
NA,BILL 2001,47
NA,Second Reading,47
NA,Debate resumed.,47
NA,Ms O'BYRNE (Bass) (1.18 p.m.)-The,47
NA,States Grants (Primary and Secondary Edu-,47
NA,cation Assistance) Amendment Bill 2001,47
NA,seeks to implement the changes to funding,48
NA,for literacy and numeracy programs outlined,48
NA,in the 2001 budget. The funding for these,48
NA,programs is for 2001-02 and 2002-03. The,48
NA,"Minister for Education, Training and Youth",48
NA,Affairs has claimed that nearly $40 million is,48
NA,planned to be spent on literacy and numeracy,48
NA,programs. This announcement was made,48
NA,"with much fanfare and beating of chests, but",48
NA,unfortunately with very little actual basis.,48
NA,Budget Paper No. 2 makes a mockery of the,48
NA,minister's claims. Under the heading ‘Im-,48
NA,"proving schooling outcomes', the years are",48
NA,"there-2001-02, 2002-03, 2003-04 and",48
NA,2004-05-but what seems to be missing is,48
NA,the millions of dollars for each year; the,48
NA,amount appears to be zero. But what else can,48
NA,we expect from this government-the mas-,48
NA,ters of mean and tricky?,48
NA,Literacy is important. It is an important,48
NA,component of our ability to function within,48
NA,our society. We certainly need to aim for not,48
NA,only high levels of literacy across the com-,48
NA,munity but high literacy levels for all indi-,48
NA,viduals within our community. This need,48
NA,was recognised by the previous Labor gov-,48
NA,ernment. In an effort to gain a benchmark,48
NA,"measure of literacy in our schools, in 1994",48
NA,the federal Labor government provided $2.6,48
NA,million for the national schools English liter-,48
NA,"acy survey, which took place in 1996, to",48
NA,provide nationally comparable data on liter-,48
NA,"acy achievement. Unfortunately, the minister,",48
NA,"Dr Kemp, could not agree with the state",48
NA,"ministers on what the results showed, so he",48
NA,went out and commissioned his own report,48
NA,on the survey. His report differed signifi-,48
NA,cantly from the initial report. The two reports,48
NA,ranged from four per cent of year 3 students,48
NA,"not achieving the benchmark for reading to,",48
NA,"according to Dr Kemp's report, some 27 per",48
NA,cent. It would not be too much of a stretch,48
NA,for someone to suggest that it was the min-,48
NA,ister's intention to artificially engineer a,48
NA,port which allowed him to claim that literacy,48
NA,standards were well below their actual mark.,48
NA,When it comes to measuring any portion,48
NA,of our community we can always rely on the,48
NA,ABS. Given that this week the census was,48
NA,"collected, I would like to note that the ABS",48
NA,has looked into literacy levels and found that,48
NA,there has been no major change in those lev-,48
NA,els over the last 20 years. There is no doubt,48
NA,"that literacy is critically important, and I",48
NA,doubt there would be any disagreement with,48
NA,this from any member of the House. But,48
NA,there is a catch: the only way we can expect,48
NA,our schools and our teachers to deliver is if,48
NA,we deliver to them the level of resources and,48
NA,the level of support they require. The reason,48
NA,for needing to deliver support is that the task,48
NA,of removing barriers to learning cannot be,48
NA,left to teachers alone. No matter how hard,48
NA,"our dedicated teaching professionals work,",48
NA,there will be barriers to attaining greater,48
NA,learning outcomes that they will not be able,48
NA,to overcome on their own. But the trick to,48
NA,providing not only the resources required but,48
NA,also the support required is realising that,48
NA,funds are required. With the transfer of funds,48
NA,"to Australia's richest schools and areas,",48
NA,teachers in our outstanding public schools,48
NA,are not receiving the funds that they know,48
NA,they need. They know it because they dedi-,48
NA,cate all of their concerns to students and to,48
NA,education. I wish the minister were half as,48
NA,committed to education policies as our,48
NA,teachers are. That is the primary reason that,48
NA,"most of them become teachers, and they are",48
NA,certainly doing their bit.,48
NA,But the federal government is not coming,48
NA,to the party. This focus has gone hand in,48
NA,hand with Dr Kemp's focus on providing,48
NA,"additional funding to private schools, seen in",48
NA,his unfair enrolment benchmark adjustment,48
NA,and in the introduction of the SES funding,48
NA,model for non-government schools. The na-,48
NA,tional literacy and numeracy plan endorsed,48
NA,in 1997 was seen by many as a response to,48
NA,the media driven perception that literacy lev-,48
NA,els were at a desperate point. The Australian,48
NA,Education Union has accused the govern-,48
NA,ment of manufacturing a literacy crisis for,48
NA,political expediency. Although it is clear that,48
NA,the literacy debate is often used for political,48
NA,"regain, one point that is not debated is the link",48
NA,"between literacy skills, socioeconomic dis-",48
NA,advantage and opportunity. A stark example,48
NA,of this is shown in a recent Australian Bu-,48
NA,reau of Statistics study which shows that the,48
NA,unemployment rate for people with poor lit-,48
NA,"eracy skills is 16 per cent, compared with",48
NA,only four per cent for those with high skills.,48
NA,We cannot allow socioeconomic disadvan-,48
NA,"tages of children to dictate their lives, op-",48
NA,portunities and outcomes. People must be,49
NA,given a fair go to achieve their full potential.,49
NA,That is why the Labor Party will introduce,49
NA,education priority zones.,49
NA,Education priority zones will focus on the,49
NA,use of education as a tool for overcoming,49
NA,economic disadvantage. DETYA's analysis,49
NA,of the 1996 national schools English literacy,49
NA,survey found that children of upper profes-,49
NA,sional or managerial parents had signifi-,49
NA,cantly higher literacy achievement than chil-,49
NA,dren of parents working in unskilled manual,49
NA,occupations. A 1993 DEET ACER report,49
NA,looked at children who had completed year,49
NA,12 and found that those who had professional,49
NA,parents were twice as likely to go to univer-,49
NA,"sity than those who had unskilled parents,",49
NA,and those from the wealthiest 25 per cent of,49
NA,families were 33 per cent more likely to go,49
NA,to university than those from the poorest 25,49
NA,per cent. The Tasmanian Primary Principals,49
NA,Association talks about the influence of pov-,49
NA,erty on educational outcomes in its recent,49
NA,report entitled Learning Together. The report,49
NA,says:,49
NA,Poverty is an additional and critical factor in the,49
NA,quest for all students to be literate and educated.,49
NA,The relationship between children living in pov-,49
NA,erty and illiteracy is well established. 40% of,49
NA,Tasmanians are now judged to be living in pov-,49
NA,"erty (The Mercury, April 15 2000), exacerbating",49
NA,our educational problems ... the highest rates of,49
NA,illiteracy is still found in our schools with the,49
NA,highest number of children coming from families,49
NA,existing below the poverty line.,49
NA,The report goes on to talk about Dr Ken,49
NA,Rowe's observation of a particular outcome,49
NA,of the poverty for boys' disruptive behaviour,49
NA,study. He said:,49
NA,There is strong evidence indicating that poor,49
NA,"eracy leads to disruptive behaviour, rather than",49
NA,disruptive behaviour leading to poor literacy. This,49
NA,"chain of poverty-poor learning, disruptive be-",49
NA,haviour is well known to educators and many,49
NA,others but has yet to be broken in a major way. It,49
NA,"now needs to be done, not only to improve the",49
NA,life chances of children from impoverished,49
NA,"homes, but for the good of society in general.",49
NA,These statistics prove that if we are to over-,49
NA,come intergenerational economic disadvan-,49
NA,"tage in our society, we must improve educa-",49
NA,tional opportunity for those disadvantaged,49
NA,children. While the Prime Minister targets,49
NA,"the nation's wealthiest schools for assistance,",49
NA,we will identify schools in low socioeco-,49
NA,nomic areas and work with the community to,49
NA,identify what is needed in those particular,49
NA,schools. We know that a one size fits all,49
NA,"policy will never work in this complex area,",49
NA,so the initiatives used in education priority,49
NA,zones will be multifaceted. In each zone the,49
NA,Commonwealth will work with communities,49
NA,to develop a plan for their particular commu-,49
NA,nity that will include a focus on core educa-,49
NA,tional outcomes such as literacy and nu-,49
NA,"meracy and year 12 completion rates, and it",49
NA,will actually be accountable for improving,49
NA,those things. Some of the initiatives could,49
NA,include employing specialist remedial liter-,49
NA,acy and numeracy teachers; extra profes-,49
NA,sional development for teachers; introducing,49
NA,a community mentor program; encouraging,49
NA,local businesses and local government to,49
NA,work with schools to motivate students and,49
NA,"provide new opportunities for them, such as",49
NA,"the excellent no dole program, which is run",49
NA,at Brooks high school within my electorate;,49
NA,"and strengthening the link between schools,",49
NA,TAFEs and universities.,49
NA,This policy demonstrates definitively the,49
NA,stark contrast between the position of the,49
NA,Howard government and the position of a,49
NA,Labor Beazley government in regard to their,49
NA,commitment to public education. Public,49
NA,schools educate over 70 per cent of our chil-,49
NA,dren. A high quality public education system,49
NA,is the backbone of a fair and equitable soci-,49
NA,ety. It is the only way we can ensure that,49
NA,"children from all backgrounds, geographical",49
NA,locations and areas of society get a fair go. In,49
NA,a recent article in Dissent titled ‘The freebie,49
NA,"down the road', Lindsay Connors explains",49
NA,lit- the effect of government indifference to,49
NA,public education:,49
NA,Educational inequality strikes at the heart of de-,49
NA,"mocracy, leaving those poor in terms of knowl-",49
NA,edge and information to be used and manipulated,49
NA,by those with greater power.,49
NA,While the Prime Minister is busy looking,49
NA,after the wealthiest and most advantaged,49
NA,"schools in our community, Labor is saying",49
NA,"loud and clear, ‘We are committed to high",49
NA,quality public education for all Australians.',49
NA,"In its recent report Learning Together, the",49
NA,Tasmanian Primary Principals Association,49
NA,talks about the importance of public educa-,50
NA,tion. It says:,50
NA,"Governments, communities and schools are right",50
NA,to relentlessly pursue the ideal that all will be,50
NA,well educated. Education is the best chance for,50
NA,"young people to become positive, active partici-",50
NA,pants in our democratic society and economy.,50
NA,The Howard government's emphasis on pri-,50
NA,vate schools endeavours to change the way,50
NA,we think about our education system. Profes-,50
NA,sor Alan Reid of the Australian Education,50
NA,Union says:,50
NA,The shift of students from the public to the pri-,50
NA,"vate system has a number of effects, the most",50
NA,significant of which is the way it threatens,50
NA,our accepted understanding about the nature of,50
NA,public education. Since it is this change which,50
NA,"endangers our democratic system, it is the one",50
NA,which most demands community attention and,50
NA,"debate ... Broadly speaking, individual private",50
NA,schools represent a certain section of the popula-,50
NA,"tion ... By contrast, public schools comprise a",50
NA,diverse cross-section of the population of their,50
NA,local communities. It is this key difference which,50
NA,is about to change. As the government facilitates,50
NA,this shift to private schooling and creates a single,50
NA,"education market, so the diversity of public",50
NA,schools will diminish.,50
NA,This change introduced by the Howard gov-,50
NA,"ernment, with the misleading rhetoric of",50
NA,"‘choice', is incredibly damaging to our soci-",50
NA,ety. It undermines the very basis of a fair and,50
NA,equitable Australia. Marginson in 1997 says,50
NA,that this emphasis:,50
NA,... encourages parental choice to be expressed in,50
NA,the form of a myriad of different monocultural,50
NA,"world views, premised explicitly on the need to",50
NA,avoid contamination by other groups. This is to,50
NA,put a value on social difference rather than toler-,50
NA,ance ... and in laying the basis for serious social,50
NA,and educational problems in the future.,50
NA,The Howard government's commitment to,50
NA,private education is demonstrated in three,50
NA,policy changes that have been made since,50
NA,they came to office in 1996: the abolition of,50
NA,"Labor's new schools policy, the introduction",50
NA,of the enrolment benchmark adjustment and,50
NA,the SES funding for non-government,50
NA,schools. Associate Professor of Education at,50
NA,"the University of South Australia, Alan Reid,",50
NA,commented for the AEU that:,50
NA,The point ... is to shift people across to private,50
NA,schools.,50
NA,The most recent evidence of this govern-,50
NA,ment's favouring of the wealthiest private,50
NA,"schools-of which, I hasten to add once",50
NA,"again, there is not a single one in Tasma-",50
NA,nia-is in the form of the SES funding,50
NA,model. The minister has abolished the previ-,50
NA,ous education resources index. This index,50
NA,was a measure of the school's ability to gen-,50
NA,erate its own funds compared to a standard,50
NA,level of school resources.,50
NA,The new SES system supposedly assesses,50
NA,need according to the socioeconomic status,50
NA,to alter of the school community but directs high,50
NA,levels of funding to the nation's wealthiest,50
NA,schools. This new system is a clear indica-,50
NA,tion of where the Howard government's pri-,50
NA,"orities lie, and that is to look after the",50
NA,wealthiest people in our community. It is a,50
NA,mode that is simply not fair. It completely,50
NA,undermines the needs based principle un-,50
NA,derlying Commonwealth funding of non-,50
NA,government schools. It takes no account of,50
NA,the school's resources and earning capacity,50
NA,"and ignores assets, donations and trust funds.",50
NA,I do not know of any state primary school in,50
NA,"my electorate that actually has a trust fund,",50
NA,but what I do know is the number of people,50
NA,who struggle to take their children on a,50
NA,school trip or to keep books in their school,50
NA,library.,50
NA,The incredible inequity of the system is,50
NA,pointed out by Lindsay Connors when she,50
NA,"asks the question, ‘Fairness for Whom?' She",50
NA,asks:,50
NA,Is it fair that significant increases will go to some,50
NA,schools with more than twice the funds to spend,50
NA,on their students as most others? The answer de-,50
NA,pends on what the policy is trying to achieve.,50
NA,"According to Dr Kemp, it was the previous edu-",50
NA,cation resources index which was unfair. This is,50
NA,like calling a common tape measure unfair ... it,50
NA,does not have human virtues like fairness. That,50
NA,depends on how it is used. Dr Kemp's repeated,50
NA,assertion that the ERI was unfair masks the fact,50
NA,that the Howard government is changing far more,50
NA,than the index. It is making radical changes to the,50
NA,game itself.,50
NA,The concept of socio-economic status comes in as,50
NA,a device only for ranking schools for public,50
NA,funding purposes. The resources the school actu-,50
NA,ally has are irrelevant under the scheme ... This is,50
NA,in no way a scheme designed to narrow the per-,51
NA,sisting gap between educational outcomes that,51
NA,reflect socio-economic differences.,51
NA,The assertion that this system will make,51
NA,non-government schools available to all,51
NA,Australians is completely ridiculous. The,51
NA,"money will be paid directly to the school,",51
NA,with no compulsion for them to reduce fees;,51
NA,thus they will still remain inaccessible to low,51
NA,income Australians. This system is not even,51
NA,to be fairly applied to all non-government,51
NA,"schools. In fact, it will apply only to the",51
NA,fifth that stand to benefit from its applica-,51
NA,"tion. Those schools will benefit greatly, and",51
NA,the rest will be funded at the level of the pre-,51
NA,vious system.,51
NA,Any initiatives that improve literacy and,51
NA,subsequently life outcomes for our children,51
NA,"must be supported. However, we must never",51
NA,forget where this government's priorities lie,51
NA,when it comes to the education of our na-,51
NA,tion's children. They do not lie with the,51
NA,struggling public schools that are battling,51
NA,overwhelming odds to give their students a,51
NA,fair go; they do not lie with the 70 per cent,51
NA,Australian children who are educated in the,51
NA,public system; they do not lie with the dedi-,51
NA,cated and hardworking teachers struggling,51
NA,with inadequate funds to still provide a qual-,51
NA,ity education for the children that they teach;,51
NA,and they do not lie with the socially and eco-,51
NA,nomically disadvantaged members of our,51
NA,"community. Their priorities, as we all know",51
NA,"too well, lie with the most socially, economi-",51
NA,cally and educationally advantaged members,51
NA,of our community.,51
NA,Literacy is undoubtedly important and so,51
NA,this bill will be supported. But a true com-,51
NA,mitment from the government to the educa-,51
NA,tion of Australian children would be re-,51
NA,"freshing and, frankly, most welcome.",51
Mrs DEANNE KELLY,ANNE KELLY (Dawson) (1.30,51
NA,p.m.)-I rise to speak in support of the States,51
NA,Grants (Primary and Secondary Education,51
NA,Assistance) Amendment Bill 2001. This is a,51
NA,very important piece of legislation. It is im-,51
NA,portant to the independent schools in my,51
NA,state of Queensland and in my electorate of,51
NA,Dawson. I take this opportunity to commend,51
NA,"the independent schools in my electorate, be",51
NA,"they Catholic, Anglican or other independent",51
NA,church based schools. They make a wonder-,51
NA,ful contribution to the education of our chil-,51
NA,dren in Dawson.,51
NA,This bill has already been unnecessarily,51
NA,delayed by the opposition and should be de-,51
NA,layed no longer. It contains no policy change,51
NA,to funding arrangements of non-government,51
NA,schools. It is simply an additional appropria-,51
NA,tion to ensure that the government can meet,51
NA,its obligations to 54 new non-government,51
NA,schools over the next four years and the al-,51
NA,"most 4,000 students who will attend them.",51
NA,"oneHaving delayed the passage of this bill once,",51
NA,I sincerely hope that the opposition gives it a,51
NA,speedy passage both here and in the Senate.,51
NA,I would like to turn to some of the misin-,51
NA,formation that is being peddled about school,51
NA,funding. One of the things that I note when I,51
NA,travel around Dawson and visit both gov-,51
NA,ernment and non-government schools is that,51
NA,the signs on government schools still say,51
NA,"what they said when I was a child, which is",51
NA,quite a while ago: Queensland state school.,51
NA,The reason they are called state schools is,51
NA,because predominantly they are the respon-,51
NA,"of sibility of the state to fund, assisted by the",51
NA,Commonwealth. The reality is that some 88,51
NA,per cent-it varies-of funding for govern-,51
NA,"ment schools, or state schools as they are",51
NA,"known in Queensland, comes from the state",51
NA,government; the remainder comes from the,51
NA,"Commonwealth. However, non-government",51
NA,"schools-private schools, church schools;",51
NA,there are a number of terms used to describe,51
NA,them-receive virtually no funding from,51
NA,state governments. They are dependent on,51
NA,"their parish, their parents and the Common-",51
NA,wealth government of the day.,51
NA,The claim is made that these private,51
NA,schools or non-government schools receive,51
NA,more per student in public funding than gov-,51
NA,ernment schools. This assertion is simply not,51
NA,"true. By 2004, government secondary",51
NA,"schools will receive approximately $8,172",51
NA,per student per year in public funding. By the,51
NA,"same year, for those students in",51
NA,"non-government schools, the amount will be",51
NA,"$5,721 per student per year-considerably",51
NA,"less. That is for non-government schools,",51
NA,including the needier schools. For those so-,51
NA,called wealthy schools-and I do not quite,51
NA,know how one determines a wealthy,51
NA,school-the amount of government funding,51
NA,"per student per year is $1,120. It is quite",52
NA,plain to see that government schools receive,52
NA,"some $8,000 per student; non-government",52
NA,schools receive some $5½ thousand; and the,52
NA,"so-called wealthier schools receive $1,100.",52
NA,The facts speak for themselves.,52
NA,I would like to turn particularly to the,52
NA,question of school funding in my home state,52
NA,of Queensland. Much has been said by the,52
NA,opposition and elements of the education,52
NA,"union movement in recent days and weeks,",52
NA,attempting to prove that Commonwealth,52
NA,funding for state schools was being cut in,52
NA,favour of private schools.,52
NA,"For the record, Commonwealth funding",52
NA,for state schools in Queensland is increasing,52
NA,to a record $440 million in 2002-an in-,52
NA,"crease of $23.6 million, or 5.7 per cent, over",52
NA,"the previous year. Compared to 1996, the last",52
NA,"year of a Labor federal government, this rep-",52
NA,resents a massive 52 per cent increase in,52
NA,funding for state schools. That is a pretty,52
NA,good record when you consider that the,52
NA,number of students since 1996 has increased,52
NA,"by only 2.3 per cent. It is quite plain that,",52
NA,while Commonwealth funding-and that is,52
NA,National and Liberal government funding-,52
NA,for state schools in Queensland has increased,52
NA,"by 52 per cent, the student numbers have",52
NA,increased by only 2.3 per cent. So we are,52
NA,accelerating funding faster than the students,52
NA,are enrolling.,52
NA,In Queensland we have heard much from,52
NA,the Queensland Teachers Union but little,52
NA,"from the Beattie state Labor government, and",52
NA,in a moment we will find out why. In 2000-,52
NA,01 the Beattie Labor government increased,52
NA,"school funding by less than one per cent,",52
NA,which the same Queensland Teachers Union,52
NA,described as ‘standstill at best'. How much,52
NA,did they increase funding by this year? By,52
NA,"4.1 per cent. But surprise, surprise, where did",52
NA,this money go? Most of it has been chewed,52
NA,up by a 4.5 per cent salary increase to teach-,52
NA,ers. So the QTU was very happy to run inter-,52
NA,ference for the Labor Party and to try to,52
NA,"point at the Commonwealth, but when the",52
NA,funding finally went up from the Beattie,52
NA,"state Labor government by 4.1 per cent, who",52
NA,had their hand out? Queensland teachers. I,52
NA,"do not begrudge them the salary increase, but",52
NA,I do begrudge them running a campaign to,52
NA,try to point the finger elsewhere.,52
NA,"Fortunately, others have been awake to it.",52
NA,"The APC Review, the newsletter of the Aus-",52
NA,"tralian Parents Council, paints a somewhat",52
NA,different picture to the story we have been,52
NA,given by the Queensland Teachers Union. In,52
NA,"this newsletter's May 2001 edition, they ex-",52
NA,press their support for increased public in-,52
NA,"vestment for all school education, especially",52
NA,in view of the alarming decline in commit-,52
NA,ment to public education by the states over,52
NA,recent years. The respected journalist Paul,52
NA,"Kelly, writing in the Australian newspaper",52
NA,"on 28 March 2001, said:",52
NA,The reality is that public schools are mainly a,52
NA,State responsibility. The fate of our education,52
NA,system lies with our Premiers.,52
NA,"Hear, hear to that! However, the Queensland",52
NA,Premier is doing precious little. Even the,52
NA,Brisbane Courier-Mail stated:,52
NA,The Queensland Teachers' Union should be made,52
NA,to write out 100 times: State education is the re-,52
NA,sponsibility of the State Government.,52
NA,Absolutely. The Courier-Mail of 8 August,52
NA,needs to be congratulated. It has got it in one.,52
NA,It went on to state:,52
NA,"So, if education funding in Queensland has fallen",52
NA,"short of what the QTU thinks appropriate, the",52
NA,protests should be aimed at the bottom end of,52
NA,"George Street, not Canberra.",52
NA,"In other words, the responsibility lies with",52
NA,"the Beattie Labor government in Brisbane,",52
NA,"not with the Commonwealth, which has in-",52
NA,creased its funding by 52 per cent since,52
NA,1996. Remember that the bulk of the in-,52
NA,crease in state funding this year has been,52
NA,chewed up by the same QTU in salary in-,52
NA,"creases, so clearly they cannot vent their",52
NA,spleen at Mr Beattie or the state minister for,52
NA,"education, Ms Bligh.",52
NA,So in the face of this underwhelming per-,52
NA,formance by the Queensland state govern-,52
NA,"ment, what is the reaction from the Queen-",52
NA,"sland Teachers Union? On Monday, 25 June",52
NA,"2001, they launched what they called ‘the",52
NA,most intense public campaign in its history',52
NA,and ‘vowed to call federal politicians to ac-,52
NA,count over state school funding'. The QTU,52
NA,said that it will focus on what they describe,52
NA,as nine marginal coalition seats in Queen-,52
NA,"sland-namely, Petrie, Moreton, Longman,",52
NA,"Blair, Wide Bay, Hinkler, Herbert, Leich-",53
NA,hardt and my own electorate of Dawson. Let,53
NA,us see what the Courier-Mail thinks of the,53
NA,QTU. The same Courier-Mail article stated:,53
NA,The QTU would be better advised to throw its,53
NA,"weight behind reform, rather than running politi-",53
NA,cal interference for the Australian Labor Party.,53
NA,"campaign is not only dishonest, but also based on",53
NA,a fair degree of self-interest. Increased federal,53
NA,funding for Queensland schools would leave the,53
NA,way open for the QTU to seek higher salaries for,53
NA,its members.,53
NA,Precisely. We have already seen what they,53
NA,do when they get an increase in funding from,53
NA,the state. Apparently they are going to chal-,53
NA,lenge us-and I refer again to federal par-,53
NA,liamentarians-to defend our local schools. I,53
NA,will very happily do that. Can I just remind,53
NA,"the QTU that for them the three Rs, which",53
NA,"used to stand for reading, (w)riting and",53
NA,"(a)rithmetic, now stand for raiding, running",53
NA,interference and ranting. So the three Rs are,53
NA,"alive and well but, unfortunately, they have",53
NA,had a political change of face. The QTU are,53
NA,raiding the increase in funding that the state,53
NA,"government gave to schools, they are run-",53
NA,ning interference for the Australian Labor,53
NA,"Party and they are ranting, trying to point",53
NA,their finger at the federal government. It is,53
NA,"fairly hard, though, to run such a campaign",53
NA,when we have increased funding to state,53
NA,schools in Queensland by 52 per cent since,53
NA,1996.,53
NA,Why do the QTU support the blatant dis-,53
NA,crimination of the Beattie Labor government,53
NA,against the state schools in my electorate of,53
NA,Dawson? I have a question to ask them when,53
NA,they come to Dawson. The Beattie govern-,53
NA,ment announced a major revamp of state,53
NA,secondary schools-its so-called Secondary,53
NA,"Schools Renewal Program, as far as it goes a",53
NA,worthy program. This was directed at,53
NA,schools which were built prior to 1975 and,53
NA,were in need of refurbishment-as I have,53
NA,"said already, a worthy idea. But there was a",53
NA,catch-a very big catch. When the minister,53
NA,announced the program and sent out the cri-,53
NA,teria and details to state secondary schools,53
NA,"around Queensland, he also indicated the",53
NA,location of the schools which would qualify,53
NA,and those which would not. Those which,53
NA,would qualify were those that were under,53
NA,competitive threat from non-government,53
NA,schools.,53
NA,Let us just think about that for one mo-,53
NA,"ment. What that means is that, if you have",53

NA,or driving distance of that particular secon-,53
NA,"Its dary state school in Queensland, then you",53
NA,"qualify. If you do not, then you do not qual-",53
NA,"ify. In other words, if a state secondary",53
NA,"school did not have competition, that is, the",53
NA,children attending the school had no choice,53
NA,"in education and nowhere else to go, then",53
NA,their needs were totally ignored by the Beat-,53
NA,tie Labor government. The schools in my,53
NA,electorate that are on this list that will re-,53
NA,ceive no renewal funding at all include the,53
NA,"secondary school in Ayr, the secondary",53
NA,school in Home Hill and the state secondary,53
NA,"schools in Bowen, Proserpine, Mirani and",53
NA,Sarina. They are excluded because children,53
NA,there have nowhere else to go. Only in Mac-,53
NA,"kay, where there are several private schools,",53
NA,were the two state schools included-and,53
NA,received a total of $6 million. Naturally I am,53
NA,pleased to see those schools receive that,53
NA,funding; but it is a pity that their country,53
NA,cousins were excluded.,53
NA,Did we hear howls of outrage from the,53
NA,"QTU? No, we did not. This appalling neglect",53
NA,of country based schools was let go through,53
NA,"to the keeper by the QTU, without a murmur",53
NA,or a whimper. They are happy to see country,53
NA,"schoolchildren in Ayr, Home Hill, Bowen,",53
NA,"Prosperpine, Mirani and Sarina totally ex-",53
NA,cluded-absolutely excluded from a program,53
NA,that would give them enhanced facilities:,53
NA,"better assembly halls, new classrooms and",53
NA,refurbishment of old and decaying buildings,53
NA,built before 1975. One of my P&C presi-,53
NA,"dents said to me that their school hall, which",53
NA,"was opened in 1978 as a P&C project, is now",53
NA,too small to accommodate all of their stu-,53
NA,"dents, so they are unable to have a whole",53
NA,"school assembly. It is an absolute disgrace,",53
NA,"which I reflected on when, on behalf of the",53
NA,"minister, I recently opened three refurbished",53
NA,science buildings at the Proserpine State,53
NA,"High School, almost entirely funded by the",53
NA,federal government-the same one the QTU,53
NA,are continually pointing their finger at. This,53
NA,citycentric Secondary Schools Renewal Pro-,53
NA,gram-only for schools where the children,53
NA,have a choice-and the citycentric QTU are,54
NA,a reflection of the Beattie government's atti-,54
NA,tude to country Queensland. How far do the,54
NA,education unions propose to go?,54
NA,Let me share with the House some recent,54
NA,quotes. We should remember that the so-,54
NA,called wealthiest non-government school,54
NA,"receives only some $1,100 a year per stu-",54
NA,"dent; by comparison, a government school",54
NA,"receives $8,000 a year per student. But what",54
NA,does the Australian Education Union want to,54
NA,do about funding for non-government,54
NA,"schools-for small church parish schools,",54
NA,"schools like St Joseph's, in my electorate, or",54
NA,"like St Colman's, in Home Hill, which I re-",54
NA,"cently visited, small schools that service",54
NA,communities where the parents struggle to,54
NA,raise fund for the most basic items but where,54
NA,there is a great deal of community pride and,54
NA,of dedication by the teachers? Let us hear,54
NA,what the Australian Education Union says,54
NA,about these church based schools. Its sub-,54
NA,mission to the Senate inquiry into the states,54
NA,"grants bill, in July 2000, stated:",54
NA,The AEU has long opposed any funding to pri-,54
NA,vate schools and will continue to do so.,54
NA,Let us hear from the New South Wales,54
NA,Teachers Federation. Sue Simpson was,54
NA,"asked, during an interview on ABC Radio on",54
NA,"Thursday, 15 March 2001:",54
NA,Do you want the government to stop funding pri-,54
NA,vate schools in all shapes and forms?,54
NA,Ms Simpson replied:,54
NA,That is certainly the ideal position of the Teachers,54
NA,Federation.,54
NA,Let us hear from the Australian Education,54
NA,"Union Tasmanian President, Mike Poate. In",54
NA,a radio interview on 26 July 2001 he said:,54
NA,The federal government must redistribute the,54
NA,money that it is currently giving to private,54
NA,schools into the public sector. That way we can,54
NA,assure the future of Australian children.,54
NA,I hope that the education unions are emi-,54
NA,nently unsuccessful with their deceptive,54
NA,"campaign. I ask the parents of Australia,",54
NA,"particularly those in Queensland, not to be",54
NA,misled. The federal National and Liberal,54
NA,government will continue to ensure that:,54
NA,… government secondary schools will receive,54
NA,"$8,172 per student in public funding. Non-",54
NA,"government schools will receive $5,721 per stu-",54
NA,dent; for those students in the so-called wealthi-,54
NA,"est schools, they will receive a mere $1,120.",54
NA,That does not sound to me like a terribly un-,54
NA,fair outcome. What it does say is that every,54
NA,child in Australia matters. Every child should,54
NA,have the best opportunity of a quality educa-,54
NA,"tion, whether they attend a government or",54
NA,non-government school. Their parents should,54
NA,have confidence in not only the federal and,54
NA,state governments but also the teachers to,54
NA,ensure that their child has the best education,54
NA,to enable them to both make a worthwhile,54
NA,career and have a satisfying adulthood. We,54
NA,are committed to that.,54
NA,"Since 1996, the federal National and Lib-",54
NA,eral government have increased funding to,54
NA,Queensland state schools by 52 per cent.,54
NA,That is an enormous amount when you con-,54
NA,sider that student numbers have increased by,54
NA,only 2.3 per cent. We are also looking to,54
NA,"those small schools, particularly in my elec-",54
NA,"torate. I have no so-called wealthy schools,",54
NA,but I do have a great number of non-,54
NA,government schools where the community,54
NA,battles extremely hard to pay fees and to as-,54
NA,sist their children-as do the parents of stu-,54
NA,dents at the state schools. The divisive cam-,54
NA,paign by the education unions to draw atten-,54
NA,tion from the fact that they have raided state,54
NA,budgets with teacher salary increases should,54
NA,"cease. We should all be committed, as the",54
NA,"federal National and Liberal government is,",54
NA,to ensuring a quality outcome for our stu-,54
NA,dents right across Australia.,54
Mr RUDD ,Griffith) (1.49 p.m.)-Educa-,54
NA,tion is the heart of the knowledge nation. The,54
NA,States Grants (Primary and Secondary Edu-,54
NA,cation Assistance) Amendment Bill 2001,54
NA,before the House is of direct relevance to the,54
NA,knowledge nation because it deals directly,54
NA,"with literacy and numeracy and, without high",54
NA,"levels of literacy and numeracy, we have no",54
NA,"knowledge nation. Regrettably, however, the",54
NA,bill is dramatically deficient in a number of,54
NA,ways. It is deficient in its quantum and it is,54
NA,"deficient in its equity, but most importantly it",54
NA,is deficient because it exists in a policy vac-,54
NA,uum. It exists in a vacuum of national vision.,54
NA,"At best, the government's approach to",54
NA,education policy could be described as frag-,54
NA,mentary. There is no attempt to relate the,54
NA,"part to the whole, as we do in the Knowledge",54
NA,Nation report. There is no attempt to formu-,55
NA,late a clear vision for the future educational,55
NA,"outcomes of the nation, as we do in Knowl-",55
NA,edge Nation. There is no attempt to link,55
NA,cational outcomes with future economic out-,55
NA,"comes for the nation, as we do in Knowledge",55
NA,"Nation. Worst of all, there is no attempt to",55
NA,defend the role of government in the overall,55
NA,delivery of education services. If there,55
NA,overriding ideological dictum on the part of,55
NA,those opposite when it comes to the role of,55
NA,"government in education, that dictum is this:",55
NA,good government is absent government;,55
NA,good government is dead government. In,55
NA,"toto, what we see in the fragments which",55
NA,constitute the government's overall approach,55
NA,to education policy is a zero response to the,55
NA,comprehensive strategy for education for the,55
NA,next decade which we presented in Knowl-,55
NA,edge Nation.,55
NA,Before going to this absence of a policy,55
NA,"framework, let us deal with the specifics of",55
NA,the amount of money in this legislation. In,55
NA,regard to literacy there is $36.9 million over,55
NA,four years from the Commonwealth of Aus-,55
NA,tralia and $10 million per annum from the,55
NA,Commonwealth of Australia to six states and,55
NA,two territory education systems. The com-,55
NA,bined education budgets of the states and the,55
NA,territories is in excess of $15 billion. The,55
NA,education budget in the state of Queensland,55
NA,alone is in excess of $3 billion. Literacy,55
NA,numeracy programs in my state of Queen-,55
NA,sland under the Beattie government are in the,55
NA,order of tens of millions of dollars. Yet what,55
NA,we have in this enormous act of public pol-,55
NA,icy munificence on the part of the Howard,55
NA,government is a bill which provides-I re-,55
NA,peat-$10 million per annum across all six,55
NA,states and two territories.,55
NA,When we look at where that fits across the,55
NA,"rest of the states, not only is it lacking in",55
NA,quantum; it fails to address what is already,55
NA,under way on the part of the states. For ex-,55
NA,"ample, has Dr Kemp, the education minister,",55
NA,heard of the year 2 and year 6 diagnostic,55
NA,"tests in my own state of Queensland, which",55
NA,go to the very heart of literacy performance,55
NA,on the part of children in the classroom? No.,55
NA,"I am here to inform Dr Kemp, the education",55
NA,"minister, that that was an initiative of the",55
NA,"Goss Labor government in 1995-96 before, I",55
NA,"think, Dr Kemp ever darkened the corridors",55
NA,outside his office as education minister. Has,55
NA,he heard of a program called Support a,55
NA,edu- Reader? Support a Reader is a program,55
NA,aimed at literacy intervention in the class-,55
NA,"room, which was again introduced into",55
NA,Queensland education in 1995-96 under the,55
NA,Goss government-before the election of the,55
NA,is an Howard government and before Dr Kemp,55
NA,had anything to do with school education.,55
NA,Has Dr Kemp heard of a program called,55
NA,the Reading Recovery Program? The Read-,55
NA,ing Recovery program was again introduced,55
NA,into the Queensland education system to deal,55
NA,with children with literacy problems in pri-,55
NA,"mary school, picked up through the year 2",55
NA,"and year 6 diagnostic tests. Again, that pro-",55
NA,"gram was introduced in 1995-96, well before",55
NA,the election of the Howard government. If,55
NA,"you look at all these things, as well as the",55
NA,introduction of dedicated literacy and nu-,55
NA,meracy teacher aides in education in the state,55
NA,"of Queensland, you will find that they all",55
NA,predated by a considerable period any inno-,55
NA,vation of any description on the part of the,55
NA,Howard government or its representative in,55
NA,"the education portfolio, Dr Kemp.",55
NA,"The federal education minister, Dr Kemp,",55
NA,claims to have invented the wheel as far as,55
NA,literacy and numeracy programs in the,55
NA,schools are concerned because some years,55
NA,and ago he commissioned a methodologically,55
NA,dodgy report on literacy performance in the,55
NA,"classroom. I would suggest that, before he",55
NA,takes on that report and adheres to the rheto-,55
NA,"ric contained within it, he should practise",55
NA,first and foremost the elementary discipline,55
NA,"of a historian, which is to look at what eve-",55
NA,"ryone else has been doing for a long, long",55
NA,time. Look at what has been happening in,55
NA,Queensland before and during the period of,55
NA,the Howard government. Look at what is,55
NA,happening in the classrooms in the other,55
NA,states and territories in terms of literacy and,55
NA,numeracy programs. Look at the history of,55
NA,Commonwealth government reporting on the,55
NA,question of literacy. Dr Kemp's 1997 report,55
NA,"was, he would say, the first breakthrough",55
NA,report on the literacy of our nation's chil-,55
NA,"dren. In fact, if you look at a report prepared",55
NA,"by the Parliamentary Library, you will find",55
NA,"that it is not the first report, but the 30th re-",55
NA,port to be prepared on literacy outcomes for,56
NA,"Australia, going back to 1975.",56
NA,If Dr Kemp and this government have not,56
NA,exactly invented a concern for literacy and,56
NA,"numeracy, then perhaps the education min-",56
NA,isters of the states and territories would,56
NA,him seriously if there were significant dollars,56
NA,"on the table, but we do not have that. I repeat",56
NA,the figures from before: a princely $10 mil-,56
NA,lion for the states and territories combined.,56
NA,There is $2 million for my own state of,56
NA,"Queensland alone, which runs a $3 billion",56
NA,education portfolio. But here is the ultimate,56
NA,"rub: this $10 million per annum, $2 million",56
NA,"for the state of Queensland, is not even new",56
NA,"money; it is old money, as the shadow min-",56
NA,"ister for education, Michael Lee, articulated",56
NA,clearly in his contribution to this debate,56
NA,"terday, and as is clearly demonstrated from",56
NA,Budget Paper No. 2.,56
NA,"Of course, that is just literacy. If we look",56
NA,at the other elements of education policy,56
NA,"performance, there is the ongoing scandal of",56
NA,the education grants for the country at large.,56
NA,We have that $145 million grant to 58 cate-,56
NA,gory 1 schools across the country- some-,56
NA,thing like $2 million a knock if you happen,56
NA,"to go to the Kings School, to Wesley or to",56
NA,one of the first-class schools around this,56
NA,tion. But what happens if you happen to go,56
NA,"to one of the Catholic systemic schools,",56
NA,which are there in large numbers in each of,56
NA,our electorates right across Australia? How,56
NA,"much do they get? About $60,000 each extra.",56
NA,What about government schools as a conse-,56
NA,quence of this grants program? They get an,56
NA,"extra $4,000 each per government school.",56
NA,There is an absence of equity in what the,56
NA,"government is doing through that program,",56
NA,but it does not stop there.,56
NA,Look at the school establishment grants.,56
NA,There was an announcement by this minister,56
NA,"of $14 million for non-government schools,",56
NA,which of course we do not oppose. But how,56
NA,many dollars have been announced for,56
NA,school establishment grants for government,56
NA,schools? Zero dollars. Yet government,56
NA,schools across Australia educate 70 per cent,56
NA,"of the nation's schoolkids. They should, on",56
NA,"the basis of equity alone, be delivered an",56
NA,extra $30 million. How much extra money,56
NA,have they been delivered? Zero dollars.,56
NA,The school education portfolio is far too,56
NA,important a portfolio to have loosed upon it a,56
NA,rampant ideologue whose ultimate view of,56
NA,government education is that it should disap-,56
NA,"pear. From an education perspective, what",56
NA,"take we have in Dr Kemp, I believe, is the Dr",56
NA,Strangelove of education. What we have in,56
NA,this person is someone on a mission from,56
NA,"God, someone who believes that his ultimate",56
NA,mission in this country is something the,56
NA,equivalent in education of eliminating the,56
NA,Soviet communist menace. But for him what,56
NA,that means in the school system is something,56
NA,like this: the elimination ultimately of public,56
NA,schools and the elimination ultimately of,56
NA,"public school teachers, and the ultimate An-",56
NA,"tichrist of all in Dr Kemp's eschatology is, of",56
NA,"yescourse, the Australian Education Union and",56
NA,every other public education union in the,56
NA,country.,56
NA,But ideology does not stop with schools. It,56
NA,also is applied to this government's continu-,56
NA,ing cold war against the universities. Let us,56
NA,look for example at research training places.,56
NA,"The shadow minister, Michael Lee, revealed",56
NA,earlier this week that this government has,56
NA,effectively brought about a 13 per cent cut in,56
NA,research training places for this nation's uni-,56
NA,na- versities. As Michael Lee has said:,56
NA,Figures from Dr Kemp's own department show,56
NA,"that there were 24,980 research training places in",56
NA,2000 and Dr Kemp's press release today-,56
NA,"that is, 6 August-",56
NA,"confirms there will only be “more than 21,600”...",56
NA,in 2001 ...,56
NA,What does that mean?,56
NA,"... a decline of 3,336 places or 13%.",56
NA,This means there will be fewer training places for,56
NA,"students doing PhDs in vital areas like IT, bio-",56
NA,technology and environmental science.,56
NA,These areas are the core of the Knowledge,56
NA,Nation.,56
NA,Dr Kemp's attack will reduce the number of re-,56
NA,search PhD students at Australia's seven,56
NA,‘UniTech' universities-,56
NA,By how many places?,56
NA,"by 1,113 places or 29%.",56
NA,It will also reduce the number of research training,56
NA,places at regional universities by 800 places or,56
NA,17%.,56
NA,And as the shadow minister concluded:,56
NA,How can Australia possibly move towards being,57
NA,a Knowledge Nation when the Howard Govern-,57
NA,ment is making such savage cuts to our research,57
NA,capabilities?,57
NA,"If we go through it campus by campus, it is",57
NA,an even more disturbing picture. If we look,57
NA,"at, for example, the unitech universities,",57
NA,"there are 458 fewer places at RMIT, a drop",57
NA,"of 46.4 per cent; a removal of 1,113 places",57
NA,from the other unitech universities. In my,57
NA,"own electorate, at Griffith University, there",57
NA,"is a loss of 214 places. This is a disgrace,",57
NA,which only this party will redress.,57
Mr SPEAKER,"Order! It being 2 p.m.,",57
NA,the debate is interrupted in accordance with,57
NA,standing order 101A. The debate may be,57
NA,resumed at a later hour and the member for,57
NA,Griffith will have leave to continue speaking,57
NA,when the debate is resumed.,57
NA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,57
NA,Workplace Relations: Workers',57
NA,Entitlements,57
Mr BEAZLEY ,2.00 p.m.)-My question,57
NA,"is to the Minister for Employment, Work-",57
NA,place Relations and Small Business. Minis-,57
NA,"ter, now that the Tristar dispute is over, are",57
NA,you going to apologise to the Tristar workers,57
NA,for calling them traitors?,57
Mr ABBOTT,I notice that the Leader,57
NA,of the Opposition never condemned a strike,57
NA,"which put 12,000 people out of work. The",57
NA,Leader of the Opposition never said boo to,57
NA,"the union that caused 12,000 workers to be",57
NA,out of work. The Leader of the Opposition,57
NA,"never condemned the Manusafe scheme,",57
NA,which amounts to a 19 per cent levy on pay-,57
NA,roll-,57
Mr BEAZLEY ," Mr Speaker, I raise a point",57
NA,"of order on relevance. It was a simple, well",57
NA,focused question. Is he going to apologise,57
NA,for calling those workers-,57
Mr SPEAKER,The Leader of the Op-,57
NA,position will resume his seat. The minister,57
NA,was asked a question relative to the Tristar,57
NA,dispute and his answer was relative to the,57
NA,Tristar dispute.,57
Mr ABBOTT,At every step of this pro-,57
NA,"cess, the Leader of the Opposition has stood",57
NA,shoulder to shoulder with the ultra-militants,57
NA,who have threatened the future of the motor,57
NA,industry. It is the Leader of the Opposition,57
NA,who should be apologising to all of the,57
NA,"12,000 workers stood down as a result of the",57
NA,industrial action that he completely sup-,57
NA,ported.,57
NA,Economy: OECD Report,57
Mr BARTLETT ,2.02 p.m.)-My ques-,57
NA,tion is addressed to the Treasurer. Will the,57
NA,Treasurer advise the House of the key find-,57
NA,ings of the latest OECD report on the Aus-,57
NA,"tralian economy, released overnight?",57
Mr COSTELLO,I thank the honour-,57
NA,able member for Macquarie for his question.,57
NA,I can report to the House that overnight the,57
NA,OECD released its economic survey on,57
NA,"Australia, forecasting growth picking up in",57
NA,2002 to 3.8 per cent and noting that Australia,57
NA,would be one of the fastest growing econo-,57
NA,mies in the developed world next year.,57
NA,We know that the United States economy,57
NA,"has slowed very considerably, the Japanese",57
NA,"economy is now in recession, Singapore is in",57
NA,"recession, Taiwan and most of South-East",57
NA,Asia have had negative quarters and Europe,57
NA,is slowing. This is making world growth,57
NA,very uncertain and weaker than it has been,57
NA,probably for over a decade. But the good,57
NA,"news is that, notwithstanding the weakness",57
NA,"of the world economy, the Australian econ-",57
NA,omy has held up very strongly and the Aus-,57
NA,tralian economy is now considered to be one,57
NA,of the strongest growing economies of the,57
NA,developed world.,57
NA,The OECD report also made a number of,57
NA,findings as to what contributed to the,57
NA,strengthening of the Australian economy. It,57
NA,"found, for example, that the recent tax re-",57
NA,form would contribute a further improve-,57
NA,"ment in economic performance, a broader",57
NA,and more efficient tax base reinforcing the,57
NA,benefits of fiscal consolidation. A narrower,57
NA,"and less efficient tax base, the kind of tax",57
NA,"base that roll-back is designed to give us,",57
NA,would of course undermine fiscal consolida-,57
NA,tion. The Labor Party would take us right,57
NA,back to where they had us: $10 billion worth,57
NA,"of debt, an $80 billion build-up of debt over",57
NA,the last five years and $23 billion worth of,57
NA,build-up of debt under the worst finance,57
NA,minister in Australian history. The OECD,57
NA,also said that major economic benefits,57
NA,should accrue from the comprehensive tax,57
NA,"reform, the first major step of which came",58
NA,into effect on 1 July 2000.,58
NA,As the Australian economy strengthens,58
NA,"over the course of 2002, we would expect",58
NA,growing job opportunities for Australians.,58
NA,Employment is a lagging indicator: as your,58
NA,"economy strengthens, you would expect,",58
NA,"after some months, jobs growth to",58
NA,strengthen. We expect jobs growth to,58
NA,strengthen in 2002.,58
NA,The OECD report is a report on the way in,58
NA,which good economic policy can bring re-,58
NA,sults. I make this point: it would not have,58
NA,happened just by accident. It would not have,58
NA,happened that Australia's exports would,58
NA,boom without taking taxes off exports; it,58
NA,would not have happened that we would,58
NA,have had low interest rates if we had not put,58
NA,the budget back into surplus; it would not,58
NA,have happened that we would have low,58
NA,home mortgage variable interest rates if we,58
NA,had not repaid $60 billion of Labor's $80,58
NA,billion worth of debt. This report shows,58
NA,"some of the benefits from economic policy,",58
NA,but the message is that good economic man-,58
NA,agement must continue. It is important that,58
NA,we keep good budget and good tax policy,58
NA,"and, most importantly, that we do not roll",58
NA,backwards on all of the good work that has,58
NA,been done in the Australian economy.,58
NA,Employment and Unemployment:,58
NA,Statistics,58
Mr CREAN ,2.06 p.m.)-My question is,58
NA,to the Treasurer and it follows his earlier,58
NA,"answer. Treasurer, how can you claim it is",58
NA,good news when you have just presided over,58
NA,the biggest recorded monthly fall in full-time,58
NA,"employment ever: a fall of 79,200 jobs last",58
NA,"month? What do you say to the 160,000",58
NA,workers who have lost their full-time jobs,58
NA,since your GST came in last July? What do,58
NA,you say to the hundreds of small business,58
NA,people being forced to the wall because of,58
NA,"your job destroying GST? Treasurer, if eve-",58
NA,"ryone has never had it so good, why are so",58
NA,many Australians and their families missing,58
NA,out?,58
Mr COSTELLO,If the Labor Party,58
NA,really believed the GST was the author of,58
NA,"such havoc on the Australian economy, they",58
NA,would have pledged to repeal it. I have never,58
NA,"really understood this point that, on the one",58
NA,"hand, the Labor Party would have you be-",58
NA,lieve that the GST has caused havoc in the,58
NA,"fastest growing economy in the world, most",58
NA,probably caused an outbreak of foot-and-,58
NA,mouth disease in the United Kingdom and,58
NA,most probably is responsible for Mount Etna,58
NA,"erupting, but, if they ever get elected to of-",58
NA,"fice, what do they want to do? They want to",58
NA,keep it. Every time you ask them about the,58
NA,"extent of roll-backwards and say, ‘GST",58
NA,raises $24 billion. Will you commit yourself,58
NA,"to rolling backwards 50 per cent, or $12 bil-",58
NA,"lion?' they say, ‘No, it's not $12 billion.' If",58
NA,"we say, ‘Will you commit to rolling back-",58
NA,"wards one-third of the way?' they say, ‘No,",58
NA,we wouldn't commit to that.' Roll-,58
NA,backwards-the policy which dare not speak,58
NA,its name-disappears by the minute. In the,58
NA,half-world of shadow and fantasy that the,58
NA,"Deputy Leader of the Opposition exists in,",58
NA,roll-backwards is the policy that is required,58
NA,but can never actually be revealed.,58
NA,"In relation to the labour force, let us put",58
NA,some facts on the table. The Australian un-,58
NA,"employment rate is currently at 6.9 per cent,",58
NA,down from its peak of 10.9 per cent in De-,58
NA,"cember 1992, when the employment minister",58
NA,was the now Leader of the Opposition. Over,58
NA,the course of the five years since this gov-,58
NA,"ernment was elected in March 1996, there",58
NA,"have been a net new 805,000 jobs created in",58
NA,the Australian economy. Youth unemploy-,58
NA,ment has come down from the all-time high,58
NA,"of 34.5 per cent in July 1992, when Mr",58
NA,"Beazley was the employment minister, to a",58
NA,"rate now of 24 per cent. As I said, we have",58
NA,made some substantial progress in relation to,58
NA,unemployment. We have undone a lot of La-,58
NA,"bor's damage. But have we finished? No, of",58
NA,course there is more work to be done in rela-,58
NA,tion to unemployment.,58
NA,What do we have to do? We need a strong,58
NA,"economy, and the Australian economy is",58
NA,holding up well compared with all of the,58
NA,economies of the developed world. More,58
NA,"than that, we need labour market reform,",58
NA,because nothing would be better to bring,58
NA,down structural unemployment than labour,58
NA,market reform. I pay tribute to the work that,58
NA,"has been done, but more labour market re-",58
NA,form needs to be done. The third thing I say,58
NA,is this: if you were really interested in people,59
NA,"maintaining their jobs in Australia, would",59
NA,you support the irresponsible union action,59
NA,"that put 10,000 people out of work last",59
NA,week? The one thing we never heard from,59
NA,the Labor Party was a condemnation of a,59
NA,"strike that threw 10,000 fellow Australians",59
NA,out of work. The Manufacturing Workers,59
NA,"Union, affiliated to the ACTU, threw 10,000",59
NA,"Australians out of work last week, and the",59
NA,old ACTU president could not bring himself,59
NA,to condemn it.,59
NA,"The Labor Party, if they get elected at the",59
NA,"next election, will have three living former",59
NA,ACTU presidents on their front bench and a,59
NA,few dead ex-ACTU presidents sitting on,59
NA,"their front bench, too. Who would ever be-",59
NA,lieve that they could take a strong stand on,59
NA,labour market reform? Who would ever be-,59
NA,lieve that they could support the kind of re-,59
NA,form that is necessary to create real jobs for,59
NA,real people in this country?,59
NA,Trade: Export Performance,59
Mrs DEANNE KELLY,ANNE KELLY (2.11 p.m.)-My,59
NA,question is addressed to the Deputy Prime,59
NA,Minister and Minister for Transport and Re-,59
NA,gional Services. Would the Deputy Prime,59
NA,Minister outline the contribution made by,59
NA,Australians in rural and regional areas to the,59
NA,nation's economic growth as reflected in the,59
NA,OECD annual review of the Australian,59
NA,economy?,59
Mr ANDERSON,I thank the honour-,59
NA,able member for Dawson for her question,59
NA,"and acknowledge that that electorate, like so",59
NA,"many others in rural and regional Australia,",59
NA,contributes massively to our export perform-,59
NA,"ance. Indeed, rural and regional exports re-",59
NA,"main-increasingly, it can be said-huge",59
NA,engines for economic growth in this country.,59
NA,There is no doubt that the partnership be-,59
NA,tween the government and rural industries,59
NA,over the last 5½ years is starting to bear very,59
NA,"real fruit. We are now, for the first time that",59
NA,"can remember in my adult life, all of which",59
NA,time I have been involved with rural Austra-,59
NA,"lia, seeing an improvement in the terms of",59
NA,trade for the nation's farmers virtually right,59
NA,"across the board. That is to say, prices and",59
NA,incomes are rising faster than costs. That,59
NA,cannot happen without sound economic,59
NA,management.,59
NA,"Indeed, the great export industries of rural",59
NA,"and regional Australia-farming, mining,",59
NA,tourism and the manufacturing industries that,59
NA,"spin off them, because the biggest employer",59
NA,of the lot in the manufacturing industry in,59
NA,Australia is the food and fibre processing,59
NA,sector-are all enjoying much improved,59
NA,prospects. Farm exports alone this year will,59
NA,"be worth almost $30 billion, up 21 per cent",59
NA,"on last year, constituting around 20 per cent",59
NA,of all of our exports. Higher prices-and this,59
NA,is an interesting point to those with an inter-,59
NA,"est in trade, including the Minister for",59
NA,Trade-mean that more will be produced.,59
NA,That is what the nation's farmers will do.,59
NA,"Higher beef prices, higher grain prices and",59
NA,"higher wool prices will result in more beef,",59
NA,more grain and more wool. Not only will that,59
NA,produce more exports; it will produce a lot,59
NA,"more manufacturing jobs, as that product is",59
NA,"value added, and exports. Minerals and oil",59
NA,exports add another $40 billion to our na-,59
NA,tion's export earnings. Even international,59
NA,visitors to rural and regional Australia earn,59
NA,the nation around $2.5 billion a year.,59
NA,The people responsible for all of this have,59
NA,shown great resilience and great courage.,59
NA,They have battled all of the seasonal irregu-,59
NA,larities that we know are a feature of living,59
NA,"in this country, but it is not so very long ago",59
NA,that they were also suffering under the yoke,59
NA,of the most monstrously damaging economic,59
NA,parameters of any of the farmers in the West-,59
NA,"ern world, with interest rates through the",59
NA,roof-two and three times what their com-,59
NA,petitors in other countries were paying.,59
NA,Every year a farmer had to add 12 or 13 per,59
NA,cent farm inflation to his budgets for the,59
NA,"year. It is a wonder, really, that the rural",59
NA,"sector survived at all, but it did. It took the",59
NA,"last 5½ years of partnership, when we have",59
NA,been prepared to put the economic house in,59
NA,order and to fight the issues that had to be,59
NA,"tackled, for that to happen. We have been",59
NA,I prepared to tackle tax reform: $3 billion of,59
NA,indirect taxes are no longer shackling our,59
NA,export industries. We have world-class tele-,59
NA,"communications, so that you can export your",59
NA,organic beef out of Birdsville directly to Ja-,59
NA,pan.,59
NA,The government have the vision to take on,59
NA,such projects as the Alice to Darwin railway,59
NA,and to ensure that AMC gets off the ground,60
NA,in Central Queensland as we become a world,60
NA,leader in light metals. The government,60
NA,worked with industries such as the pork in-,60
NA,dustry through great difficulties to see it,60
NA,"ceed in export markets, when every cheap-",60
NA,jack political opportunist in the nation-par-,60
NA,ticularly those opposite- was running,60
NA,around saying that we ought to resort to,60
NA,protectionism. We did the hard yards. We,60
NA,held a course on reform. The pork industry,60
NA,today is in the best shape it has been in for,60
NA,"decades, with a very strong future based on",60
NA,"exports, particularly into Asia.",60
NA,These investments we have made are,60
NA,showing dividends in the very strong growth,60
NA,figures put forward by the OECD. Rural and,60
NA,regional Australia is right up there making its,60
NA,contribution. What do we find from the op-,60
NA,position-those who ought to be responsible,60
NA,for putting forward a policy position to this,60
NA,vitally important part of the Australian,60
NA,community? Do we find criticism or objec-,60
NA,tive remarks about the government's poli-,60
NA,"cies? No. Worse than that, do we find any",60
NA,ideas at all from the opposition? No. When,60
NA,given an opportunity-a free kick-my op-,60
NA,position spokesman was not even prepared to,60
NA,respond to an invitation to speak to a jour-,60
NA,nalist about an article on reform in rural and,60
NA,regional Australia. I think that says it all.,60
NA,Employee Entitlements Support Scheme,60
Mr BEAZLEY ,2.16 p.m.)-My question,60
NA,"is to the Minister for Employment, Work-",60
NA,place Relations and Small Business. Minis-,60
NA,"ter, do you recall releasing a paper in January",60
NA,this year entitled The protection of employee,60
NA,"entitlements on employer insolvency, which",60
NA,noted that your employee entitlements,60
NA,scheme is a mere safety net? It concluded:,60
NA,This does not preclude the adoption of additional,60
NA,measures by particularly employers and employ-,60
NA,ees. Such an approach would place the obligation,60
NA,directly on the employer concerned and could,60
NA,deliver 100 per cent of what is owed to the em-,60
NA,ployee.,60
NA,"Minister, isn't this exactly what the workers",60
NA,at Tristar did? I ask you again: will you,60
NA,apologise to the Tristar workers for calling,60
NA,"them traitors, when all they did was to follow",60
NA,your prescription by legally bargaining at the,60
NA,workplace to secure their legal entitlements?,60
Mr SPEAKER,The Leader of the Op-,60
NA,position is now entering into argument.,60
Mr ABBOTT,I will never apologise for,60
NA,"trying to end strikes, because strikes cost",60
NA,suc- jobs. This government is in the business of,60
NA,"ending strikes and opposing strikes, not sup-",60
NA,porting them or fanning them like the oppo-,60
NA,sition do. Workers at Tristar have now had,60
NA,their entitlements protected. They have had,60
NA,their entitlements protected because the,60
NA,company offered them an insurance policy.,60
NA,"What the company did not do, would not do",60
NA,and will not do is support the Manusafe,60
NA,scheme-the scheme that the Leader of the,60
NA,"Opposition supports, the scheme the opposi-",60
NA,tion supports and the scheme which will ul-,60
NA,timately add 19 per cent to payroll costs and,60
NA,cost hundreds of thousands of jobs across the,60
NA,manufacturing industry.,60
NA,Taxation: Government Policy,60
Mr CAMERON THOMPSON ,2.19,60
NA,p.m.)-My question is to the Treasurer.,60
NA,Would the Treasurer advise the House if he,60
NA,is aware of any policy proposals to increase,60
NA,the tax burden on Australians?,60
Mr COSTELLO,I thank the honour-,60
NA,able member for his question. Some infor-,60
NA,mation has come to my attention that there,60
NA,are people in Australia advocating higher,60
NA,taxes.,60
Mr HOWARD ,You've been reading the,60
NA,papers again.,60
Mr COSTELLO,"No, I have been",60
NA,"watching TV. Everybody would know, and I",60
NA,"think the ABC would know, that I am an",60
NA,avid watcher of the 7.30 Report. Last night,60
NA,there was a story regarding school funding,60
NA,"which reported that, while the Howard gov-",60
NA,"ernment maintains that some states, which",60
NA,are primarily responsible for public school,60
NA,"funding, are failing, five Labor ministers are",60
NA,preparing to convince voters otherwise. They,60
NA,have set up a task force to demonstrate that,60
NA,the Commonwealth should pitch in more and,60
NA,are considering mounting an advertising,60
NA,campaign. One proposal for raising extra,60
NA,money for public schools is an education,60
NA,levy similar to the Medicare levy. That is,60
NA,from five Labor ministers. The 7.30 Report,60
NA,went to Professor Simon Marginson. Profes-,60
NA,sor Simon Marginson is the author of that,60
NA,much vaunted document that was released at,61
NA,"the Sydney Institute, formerly known as",61
NA,Knowledge Nation but now known as the,61
NA,noodle nation. Simon Marginson said this on,61
NA,the 7.30 Report:,61
NA,I suspect there's probably sufficient community,61
NA,support for that-,61
NA,"that is, the education levy",61
NA,because people do want to pay more taxes if they,61
NA,know it's going to go to education.,61
NA,Professor Marginson costed Knowledge Na-,61
NA,tion at $12 billion per annum. He was the,61
NA,author of the report that the Leader of the,61
NA,Opposition relied on when he was still talk-,61
NA,ing about knowledge nation.,61
NA,Mr Crean interjecting-,61
Mr COSTELLO,The Deputy Leader of,61
NA,"the Opposition interjects. He says, ‘Where",61
NA,does he sit on that side?' Let me ask him:,61
NA,where does the member for Lyons sit on that,61
NA,side? According to the AAP report this,61
NA,"morning, on his way into the parliament-",61
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,61
Mr COSTELLO,You can always tell,61
NA,"when they interject the loudest, Mr Speaker,",61
NA,that they are showing great excitement at the,61
NA,quote which is about to come. According to,61
NA,"the AAP report, the member for Lyons told",61
NA,reporters on his way into parliament:,61
NA,Levies for one thing or another (are) being touted,61
NA,around ... I think it's because in Australia we've,61
NA,got into low-taxing regime.,61
NA,People on this side would probably agree,61
NA,that we have got into a low taxing regime-,61
NA,and we remember that the Labor Party,61
NA,fought us every single step of the way as we,61
NA,went into it. The member for Lyons went on,61
NA,to say:,61
NA,I think people are looking for higher revenues.,61
NA,People are starting to realise that services can,61
NA,only be provided by having a tax regime that can,61
NA,pay for those services ... and whether that's an,61
NA,"environmental levy, or whether it's a levy for",61
NA,"education, or whether it's a levy to send troops",61
NA,"East Timor, it's one way of us funding our future",61
NA,services.,61
NA,Let us make it clear: a levy on incomes is,61
NA,increasing income taxes. The Manager of,61
NA,Opposition Business has just been up to have,61
NA,a little chat with him. He probably went up,61
NA,"to pull a lever, so that his chair would open",61
NA,up and he would disappear into the floor.,61
Mr SPEAKER,The Treasurer will re-,61
NA,turn to the question.,61
Mr COSTELLO,Don't you sometimes,61
NA,wish that the ground would just open up and,61
NA,you could fall through-the member for Ly-,61
NA,ons does. So the member for Lyons is into,61
NA,higher income taxes; Professor Simon Mar-,61
NA,ginson is into higher income taxes; five La-,61
NA,bor ministers are into higher income taxes;,61
NA,the member for Fremantle is into education,61
NA,bonds; and the Leader of the Opposition is,61
NA,into mezzanine finance-noodle finance for,61
NA,the noodle nation. So we are going to have,61
NA,some noodle finance now. All of this is in the,61
NA,context of an opposition which says it is go-,61
NA,"ing to roll backwards on GST, it is going to",61
NA,spend more money and it is going to have,61
NA,"bigger surpluses. It is going to spend more, it",61
NA,is going to tax less and it is going to have,61
NA,more left over at the end of the day. Why,61
NA,"didn't we think of that? You tax less, you",61
NA,spend more and you have more at the end of,61
NA,the day-in 5½ years they have come up,61
NA,with a genius of an idea!,61
NA,Workplace Relations: Workers',61
NA,Entitlements,61
Mr BEAZLEY ,2.25 p.m.)-My question,61
NA,"is to the Minister for Employment, Work-",61
NA,place Relations and Small Business. Minis-,61
NA,"ter, will you apologise to the Australian",61
NA,community for your provocative behaviour,61
NA,this week in seeking to prolong the Tristar,61
NA,dispute with your inflammatory comments,61
NA,and actions?,61
NA,Government members interjecting-,61
Mr SPEAKER,The Leader of the Op-,61
NA,position has the call and will be heard in si-,61
NA,lence.,61
Mr BEAZLEY,"Minister, is it not the",61
NA,"case that, if the employer had followed your",61
NA,"advice to not compromise, the dispute at",61
NA,"to Tristar would still be running, throwing",61
NA,thousands more people out of work? Instead,61
NA,"of being an industrial arsonist, why won't",61
NA,you act as a responsible minister and seek to,61
NA,"settle industrial disputes, not inflame them,",61
NA,"and to achieve fair outcomes for all parties,",61
NA,not just one side?,61
NA,"Mr Ross Cameron- Mr Speaker, I rise",62
NA,on a point of order. On page 511 of House of,62
NA,Representatives Practice it says that the,62
NA,pose of standing order 144 is to attempt to,62
NA,restrain the questioner from giving unneces-,62
NA,sary information or introducing or inviting,62
NA,argument and thereby initiating a debate.,62
NA,Besides the hypothetical dimension to the,62
NA,"question, there was not even the pretence of",62
NA,avoiding argument. The question is an invi-,62
NA,tation to debate and should be ruled out of,62
NA,order.,62
Mr SPEAKER,I could be tempted to,62
NA,rule the question out of order if I were,62
NA,dictive Speaker concerned about the fact that,62
NA,I could not be heard above those who chose,62
NA,to continue interjecting. The question con-,62
NA,tains more argument than is desirable. The,62
NA,Leader of the Opposition is aware of that. I,62
NA,will allow the question to stand.,62
Mr ABBOTT,Tristar did not compro-,62
NA,mise. They opposed Manusafe at the begin-,62
NA,ning and they opposed Manusafe at the end.,62
NA,Tristar offered an insurance bond to their,62
NA,workers a week before this strike finished,62
NA,and it was completely rejected by the Metal,62
NA,"Workers Union, with the full support of the",62
NA,"Leader of the Opposition, because they were",62
NA,"pursuing political objectives, not industrial",62
NA,objectives. Let me also remind members op-,62
NA,posite that this government sought to inter-,62
NA,vene before the commission in support of a,62
NA,return to work application. We supported a,62
NA,return to work application. I did not see any,62
NA,support for a return to work application from,62
NA,members opposite.,62
NA,Trade: OECD Report,62
Mr SECKER ,2.29 p.m.)-My question,62
NA,is addressed to the Minister for Trade. Would,62
NA,the minister inform the House of the impli-,62
NA,cations for Australia's trade performance of,62
NA,the OECD forecasts? What part did exports,62
NA,play in the good OECD predictions? Are,62
NA,there any threats to achieving this positive,62
NA,trading future?,62
Mr VAILE,I thank the member for,62
NA,Barker for his question and his interest. The,62
NA,economic survey on Australia's performance,62
NA,and projection for the future that has been,62
NA,released by the OECD is quite outstanding.,62
NA,"Of course, there has been a significant con-",62
NA,tribution from Australia's exporting indus-,62
NA,tries in that performance. This document is a,62
NA,pur- glowing endorsement of Australia's eco-,62
NA,nomic performance. I believe it is a clear,62
NA,recommendation why Australians should not,62
NA,elect a Labor government at the end of this,62
NA,year. All the indicators in this document rein-,62
NA,force the importance of the policy settings,62
NA,that our government has put in place since,62
NA,we came to office in 1996.,62
NA,Prior to the government coming to office,62
NA,"in 1996, we earned about $99 billion from",62
NA,"our exports. This year, we are on track to",62
NA,a vinearn $153 billion from exports-a 54 per,62
NA,cent increase. That is the significant contri-,62
NA,bution that exports have made to that growth,62
NA,"in our economy during that period. Also, the",62
NA,OECD report indicates that the economy is,62
NA,likely to grow between 3.5 and four per cent,62
NA,"in 2002, which is described by the OECD as",62
NA,remarkable in the face of slowing world,62
NA,growth. All that is built on a number of indi-,62
NA,cators that were highlighted in the report.,62
NA,Some of the key findings in the report were,62
NA,that company profitability is strong and cor-,62
NA,porate balance sheets are in good shape.,62
NA,GDP growth is projected to pick up to 3.5,62
NA,per cent to four per cent. There have been no,62
NA,major second-round inflation effects from,62
NA,GST. The 2001-02 Commonwealth budget,62
NA,remains focused on preserving the significant,62
NA,consolidation gains achieved in recent years.,62
NA,"The underlying budget position is sound, and",62
NA,"Commonwealth net debt has fallen sharply,",62
NA,surpassing the government's target to halve,62
NA,"the ratio from its 1995-96 level, and major",62
NA,economic benefits should accrue from the,62
NA,comprehensive tax reforms that have been,62
NA,implemented.,62
NA,One of the more interesting statistics in,62
NA,the document is a graph of the differential,62
NA,between interest rates in Australia and one of,62
NA,"our major trading partners, the US. It indi-",62
NA,cates that the difference between Australian,62
NA,and US interest rates is now less than half of,62
NA,"one per cent. Under Labor, Australians were",62
NA,paying more than three per cent more than,62
NA,Americans. That was the result of Labor's,62
NA,lazy policies of that time. The graph indi-,62
NA,cates how the competitive nature of our,62
NA,economy has significantly improved under,62
NA,"the reform regimes that we have introduced,",62
NA,"with tax reform, industrial relations reform,",63
NA,and the removal of $3½ billion of taxes off,63
NA,the back of our exports to achieve that $153,63
NA,billion figure. What are the risks? The,63
NA,OECD says that Australia should continue,63
NA,"with this positive outlook for the economy,",63
NA,provided there are no major economic im-,63
NA,balances. We should ask ourselves: what,63
NA,could those imbalances be?,63
NA,We have seen a number of comments re-,63
NA,"cently, as has been outlined in the media and",63
NA,"here in the House. Labor believes, and the",63
NA,"Leader of the Opposition believes, that Aus-",63
NA,tralians do not pay too much tax. Labor,63
NA,would have to raise taxes to pay for all the,63
NA,Beazley-Crean promises. Now we have seen,63
NA,the Democrats saying that taxes are not too,63
NA,high and that they would block any proposals,63
NA,in the Senate for tax cuts. The Democrats,63
NA,have given a green light to the Labor Party to,63
NA,increase taxes. If the Labor Party is elected at,63
NA,"the end of this year, there will be no opposi-",63
NA,tion in the Senate regarding increasing the,63
NA,taxes that we have worked so hard to remove,63
NA,from the backs of Australian exporters. They,63
NA,will put back on again the $3½ million worth,63
NA,of tax cuts off exporters if a Labor govern-,63
NA,ment are elected at the end of this year. As I,63
NA,"have said, the OECD has said that Australia",63
NA,should continue with its positive outlook for,63
NA,"the economy, provided there are no major",63
NA,economic imbalances. The only economic,63
NA,imbalance on the horizon in Australia is a,63
NA,Beazley-Crean imbalance.,63

Mr SPEAKER,The Deputy Leader of,63
NA,the Opposition will resume his seat.,63
NA,Honourable members interjecting-,63
Mr SPEAKER,I remind the member,63
NA,for Batman that I have not in fact given any,63
NA,ruling.,63
NA,Honourable members interjecting-,63
Mr SPEAKER,When the House has,63
NA,come to order. Member for Reid!,63
NA,Government members interjecting-,63
Mr SPEAKER,I believe that was the,63
NA,member for Sturt. His interjection has been,63
NA,noted. I call the member for La Trobe.,63
NA,Mr Charles-Thank you Mr Speaker. I,63
NA,would have thought that it was more than,63
NA,relevant for the member for La Trobe to,63
NA,question whether there are other policies-,63
Mr SPEAKER,The member for La,63
NA,Trobe will resume his seat. I presumed that,63
NA,the member for La Trobe had a point of or-,63
NA,der. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition,63
NA,has asked why it is that I have ruled one,63
NA,question out of order on the basis of imputa-,64
NA,tion and not another. The question asked by,64
NA,the Leader of the Opposition made an unjus-,64
NA,tifiable imputation of the motives of the,64
NA,"Minister for Employment, Workplace Rela-",64
NA,tions and Small Business. The question,64
NA,asked by the member for La Trobe did not in,64
NA,fact impute any unjustifiable motives to any,64
NA,individual. The question is in order.,64
Mr ABBOTT,Just so that I can satisfy,64
"the Leader of the Opposition, Mr SPEAKER ",,64
Mr SPEAKER,The Leader of the Op-,64
NA,position's question has been ruled out of or-,64
NA,der. The question which stands is the ques-,64
NA,tion from the member for La Trobe.,64
Mr ABBOTT,"And I am answering it,",64
NA,Mr Speaker. Let me make it very clear that,64
NA,"the Tristar strike, from the beginning, was",64
NA,supported by the opposition. From the be-,64
NA,ginning it was opposed by this government.,64
NA,"Mr MCMullan- Mr Speaker, on a point",64
NA,of order: the standing orders and House of,64
NA,Representatives Practice give you responsi-,64
NA,bility for maintaining order in this House.,64
NA,How can you expect this House to be in or-,64
NA,der when you rule out the Leader of the Op-,64
NA,position's question and allow the Minister,64
NA,"for Employment, Workplace Relations and",64
NA,Small Business to continue to tell lies about,64
NA,the opposition? It will not suffice!,64
Mr SPEAKER,The Manager of Oppo-,64
NA,sition Business will resume his seat. The,64
NA,Manager of Opposition Business is well,64
NA,aware that the occupier of the chair is con-,64
NA,strained by the standing orders. As an occu-,64
NA,"pier of the chair, in common, I would have",64
NA,"thought, with all the other occupiers of the",64
NA,"chair and members of the Speaker's Panel, I",64
NA,"bristle every time I hear the words, ‘It's a",64
NA,lie.' I hear it as frequently from my left,64
NA,"do from my right. Under the standing orders,",64
NA,the accusation of lies levelled at any individa,64
NA,ual is out of order. The generalised accusa-,64
NA,tion is highly undesirable and calls for my,64
NA,"intervention, but the standing orders do not",64
NA,"provide for it. However, there is a provision",64
NA,to maintain a particular dignity in the House,64
NA,which I believe is eroded by that sort of in-,64
NA,tervention. I do not believe that it is a,64
NA,ment that should be made by those on my,64
NA,left or by the minister in response to the,64
NA,question on my right.,64
NA,Ms Kernot-Couldn't he just tell the,64
NA,truth?,64
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The member for,64
NA,Dickson is not in any sense facilitating the,64
NA,"debate or, I would have thought, assisting the",64
NA,case of the Manager of Opposition Business.,64
NA,Mr MCMullan-May I make a represen-,64
NA,"tation to you, Mr Speaker, on the point of",64
NA,order that I raised before? I was not asking,64
NA,you to go outside the point of order or prece-,64
NA,dents. You have a standard responsibility,64
NA,under the standing orders and House of Rep-,64
NA,"resentatives Practice, in general beyond the",64
NA,"specific standing orders, to maintain order in",64
NA,this place. This minister is continually highly,64
NA,provocative and he does tell monstrous un-,64
NA,"truths consistently, persistently and regularly,",64
NA,and he has done so today. In the circum-,64
NA,stances in which you ruled out what we con-,64
NA,sidered to be a perfectly legitimate question,64
NA,"by the Leader of the Opposition, you cannot",64
NA,expect the normal order to prevail when you,64
NA,allow this minister to continue to behave as,64
NA,"he does, and as he has.",64
Mr SPEAKER,Let me rise to make it,64
NA,perfectly clear that my ruling on the Leader,64
NA,of the Opposition's question was consistent,64
NA,with the standing orders and in fact it did,64
NA,have an imputation that no occupier of the,64
NA,chair would have tolerated; that I do not ap-,64
NA,preciate anyone at the dispatch box deliber-,64
NA,ately being deceitful; that I will not tolerate,64
NA,accusations of lying being levelled at any,64
NA,individual; that I believe the dignity of the,64
NA,House is enhanced if everyone raises the,64
NA,standard of their language; and that I also,64
NA,recognise that on both my left and my right I,64
NA,as I have people-147 of them-who want the,64
NA,"standard of the parliament raised and who, as",64
NA,"rule of thumb, cooperate in making that",64
NA,"possible. In fact, I am proud to be the",64
NA,Speaker of the House and I believe that there,64
NA,has been a great deal more tolerance exer-,64
NA,cised in the House than on some occasions,64
NA,when I have been in the place over the last,64
NA,"18 years. The Minister for Employment,",64
NA,com- Workplace Relations and Small Business has,64
NA,the call. The matter has been dealt with and I,64
NA,ask the minister to exercise appropriate con-,64
NA,straint.,64
Mr ABBOTT,"Thank you, Mr Speaker.",65
NA,"On the Meet the Press program last Sunday,",65
NA,Paul Bongiorno asked a question about the,65
NA,Tristar strike. He said:,65
NA,A lot of jobs are at stake there. Do you support,65
NA,the strike?,65
NA,"And the answer was, ‘Well, I do.' And that",65
NA,was from the shadow minister for employ-,65
NA,"ment, the member for Dickson.",65
NA,Ms Kernot-Read the rest.,65
Mr ABBOTT,"I will read the rest, ‘Well,",65
NA,I do support the strike.' That is what she said.,65
NA,Let me quote her exactly. She said:,65
NA,"Well, I do, in that workers have a very important",65
NA,right to pursue their legal entitlements.,65
NA,You support the strike. It is as simple as that.,65
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,65
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The minister has,65
NA,the call.,65
Mr ABBOTT,"It is as simple as that, Mr",65
NA,Speaker. Labor supports strikes and this gov-,65
NA,ernment opposes them. That is the simple,65
NA,truth. Labor supports strikes and this gov-,65
NA,ernment tries to end them. This government,65
NA,is extremely pleased that this particular strike,65
NA,is over. It was a strike against the national,65
NA,interest. It was a strike that was costing,65
NA,"Holden alone $120 million in lost sales, and",65
NA,"it was putting 12,000 decent Australians out",65
NA,of work.,65
NA,This government had two objectives in,65
NA,this dispute. Its first objective was to get,65
NA,people back to work and its second objective,65
NA,was to stop industry-wide pattern bargaining,65
NA,in support of the dangerous Manusafe pro-,65
NA,"posal. As a result, in part, of this govern-",65
NA,"ment's work, the people at Tristar are back at",65
NA,"work. Their entitlements are protected, but",65
NA,"not by the union controlled, job destroying",65
NA,"Manusafe fund. Unfortunately, the AMWU",65
NA,has not given up its Manusafe campaign. It,65
NA,still wants to force businesses to pay up to 19,65
NA,per cent of payroll into a union controlled,65
NA,fund to protect so-called entitlements which,65
NA,"may never crystallise. This union, the",65
NA,"AMWU, has threatened further industrial",65
NA,"action against 600 businesses, large and",65
NA,"small, across our economy, and that indus-",65
NA,trial action will have the full support of the,65
NA,Leader of the Opposition.,65
NA,The Leader of the Opposition never con-,65
NA,demned the Tristar strike. He never opposed,65
NA,Manusafe and he never provided leadership.,65
NA,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition sup-,65
NA,ported the strike; the member for Dickson,65
NA,supported the strike; they all supported the,65
NA,AMWU. They have got to support the,65
NA,AMWU because the unions and the party are,65
NA,all part of the same ACTU-Labor Inc. politi-,65
NA,"cal-industrial complex, designed to ensure",65
NA,"government of the unions, by the unions, for",65
NA,the unions.,65
NA,Mr MCMullan-I rise under standing or-,65
NA,"der 52, Mr Speaker. It is important for you to",65
NA,"maintain order in this place, and this minister",65
NA,has provocatively and deliberately misled the,65
NA,parliament about the attitudes of various,65
NA,members. We know that he is in possession,65
NA,"of the facts, because he quoted from a tran-",65
NA,script in which at least one of our shadow,65
NA,ministers clearly said that she did not support,65
NA,"Manusafe, and he has never ever acknowl-",65
NA,edged that. He is consistently and deliber-,65
NA,ately misleading the House.,65
Mr SPEAKER,The Manager of Oppo-,65
NA,sition Business will resume his seat. The,65
NA,Manager of Opposition Business did not,65
NA,have a valid point of order under standing,65
NA,order 52. Has the minister concluded his an-,65
NA,swer?,65
Mr ABBOTT,Members opposite al-,65
NA,ways support the AMWU. They cannot af-,65
NA,ford not to support the AMWU. In the last,65
NA,"year for which figures are available, the",65
NA,"AMWU gave them $680,000.",65
NA,"Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point",65
NA,of order that you believe you have finalised.,65
NA,This highlights the inconsistency of your,65
NA,ruling on the leader versus the member for,65
NA,La Trobe. The tag from the member for La,65
NA,Trobe clearly gives the hook. If you do not,65
NA,"interpret it to be an imputation on us, the",65
NA,minister uses it as licence to impute lies on,65
NA,the opposition that cannot be sustained.,65
Mr SPEAKER,The Deputy Leader of,65
NA,the Opposition will resume his seat.,65
NA,Mr Crean-I have not finished the point,65
NA,of order.,65
Mr SPEAKER,I have required that the,65
NA,Deputy Leader of the Opposition resume his,65
NA,seat. I remind the Deputy Leader of the Op-,65
NA,position and any who may care to listen that,66
NA,there are a number of standing orders that,66
NA,"apply to questions and I have endeavoured,",66
NA,"as have my predecessors, to impartially ap-",66
NA,ply those standing orders. There is one,66
NA,standing order that applies to answers-that,66
NA,"is, that the answer must be relevant to the",66
NA,question. I have maintained the standing or-,66
NA,ders consistent with all previous occupiers of,66
NA,the chair. If the minister has not concluded,66
NA,"his answer, will he bring his answer rapidly",66
NA,to a conclusion.,66
Mr ABBOTT,Members opposite have,66
NA,to support the AMWU because the AMWU,66
NA,has the largest single bloc vote inside the,66
NA,Labor Party.,66
NA,"Mr MCMullan-I rise on a point of order,",66
NA,Mr Speaker. By what manner is that state-,66
NA,ment relevant to the question?,66
Mr SPEAKER,The question asked was,66
NA,"about Tristar, the motor industry and support",66
NA,or otherwise of the strike. I do believe the,66
NA,minister has in fact overstated the case that,66
NA,"he was raising, but I cannot rule his answer",66
NA,other than relevant to the question. I have,66
NA,asked the minister to bring his answer to a,66
NA,"conclusion, but there is no way that in fact he",66
NA,could be deemed to have drawn it out with,66
NA,what was a very brief response before the,66
NA,Deputy Leader of the Opposition raised a,66
NA,point of order.,66
Mr ABBOTT,In any choice between,66
NA,"the union interest and the national interest,",66
NA,the Leader of the Opposition can be relied,66
NA,upon to take the union interest. In any indus-,66
NA,"trial conflict, the Leader of the Opposition",66
NA,will always stand-,66
NA,"Mr O'Keefe- Mr Speaker, I take a point",66
NA,"of order. In taking my point of order, I take",66
NA,the lead from the comment you just made. In,66
NA,"fact, standing order 85 allows the chair to",66
NA,down a member who engages in tedious,66
NA,repetition of his or her own arguments- and,66
NA,that is the minister's position.,66
Mr SPEAKER,The member for Burke,66
NA,will resume his seat. The minister is con-,66
NA,cluding his answer.,66
Mr ABBOTT,In any industrial dispute,66
NA,"anywhere in this country, the Leader of the",66
NA,Opposition can always be found standing,66
NA,"shoulder to shoulder with union militants, as",66
NA,was revealed by the celebrated Sydney,66
NA,Morning Herald photograph on 13 July.,66
NA,Workplace Relations: Workers',66
NA,Entitlements,66
Mr BEAZLEY ,2.51 p.m.)-My question,66
NA,"is to the Minister for Employment, Work-",66
NA,place Relations and Small Business. Will,66
NA,you confirm that the deal negotiated between,66
NA,Tristar and its workers requires the employer,66
NA,to pay 1.5 per cent of their payroll for an,66
NA,insurance bond costing $1.4 million? Isn't it,66
NA,"also a fact that, under Labor's employee en-",66
NA,"titlements scheme, employers will be re-",66
NA,quired to pay just an additional 0.1 per cent,66
NA,"on their superannuation contributions, which",66
NA,"would have cost just $23,000? Minister, why",66
NA,are you forcing employers to suffer industrial,66
NA,disputes and to pay more under your formula,66
NA,"when, under our plan, the scheme will be",66
NA,legislated and employers will pay substan-,66
NA,tially less?,66
Mr ABBOTT,I have no reason to doubt,66
NA,the Leader of the Opposition's statement that,66
NA,the company is in fact paying 1.5 per cent for,66
NA,"the insurance bond. But Manusafe, the",66
NA,scheme that this strike was over-,66
Mr BEAZLEY ," Mr Speaker, I raise a point",66
NA,of order which goes to relevance very di-,66
NA,rectly. The contrast here was with the,66
NA,"scheme that we in fact support, which is not",66
NA,Manusafe. The scheme that we support is,66
NA,"ours. And it is $23,000 versus $1.4 million.",66
NA,He immediately started on an irrelevant,66
NA,matter in his answer.,66
Mr SPEAKER,The Leader of the Op-,66
NA,position will resume his seat. The minister,66
NA,had been on his feet for 21 seconds. I call the,66
NA,minister.,66
Mr ABBOTT,This dispute was about,66
NA,"Manusafe, and Manusafe requires up to 19",66
NA,sit per cent of payroll. That is what the company,66
NA,rejected and that is what they were right to,66
NA,reject.,66
NA,Wool Industry: Stockpile,66
Mr HAWKER ,2.53 p.m.)-My question,66
NA,"is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries",66
NA,and Forestry. I ask the minister: would he,66
NA,update the House on the final disposal of,66
NA,Australia's wool stockpile? Has the govern-,66
NA,ment moved quickly to refund more of,66
NA,growers' equity?,66
Mr TRUSS,I am delighted to report to,67
NA,"the House that, at long last, the bottom of",67
NA,Australia's wool stockpile is in sight.,67
NA,"it goes, the memories of another Labor Party",67
NA,failure will finally be erased for the farmers,67
NA,"of Australia. There are fewer than 2,000",67
NA,bales of wool left in the stockpile as we,67
NA,"speak, and that is expected to be sold over",67
NA,"the next few days. As a result, I introduced",67
NA,legislation to the House today to wind up,67
NA,"early Woolstock Australia, the body that has",67
NA,been charged with managing the wool stock-,67
NA,"pile, and so the funds can be quickly returned",67
NA,to those growers who have endured the pain,67
NA,of the interest charges and the depressed,67
NA,market over a long period of time. It will be,67
NA,a historic day when the last of the 4.7 million Australia.,67
NA,bales from the stockpile is finally disposed,67
NA,of. A debt of $2.8 billion has already been,67
NA,"fully repaid and, at last, there are some re-",67
NA,turns going to the wool growers.,67
NA,It was an extraordinary period of Austra-,67
NA,"lian history, a legacy of remarkable policy",67
NA,failure by Labor when in government. The,67
NA,whole of the wool debacle can be traced,67
NA,back to some inappropriate comments by the,67
NA,Labor agriculture minister of the day who,67
NA,"destroyed confidence in the wool market,",67
NA,which immediately resulted in a depressed,67
NA,market and began a disastrous decade for the,67
NA,wool producers of Australia. As this stock-,67
NA,pile rolls out the door we wipe out a memory,67
NA,yet again of Labor's disastrous term in gov-,67
NA,ernment.,67
NA,I congratulate Woolstock and Don,67
NA,"MCGauchie, his board and staff for the",67
NA,prompt and efficient way in which they have,67
NA,cleaned up this Labor Party mess. It has,67
NA,taken us six years to get rid of what Labor,67
NA,destroyed over their 13 years. Wool can be,67
NA,traded fairly and freely in the marketplace,67
NA,for the first time in decades. The trading will,67
NA,be done without being depressed by the mas-,67
NA,"sive stockpile, which has certainly overlaid",67
NA,every sale and trade for more than a decade.,67
NA,"It is a new beginning for the wool industry,",67
NA,an opportunity for that industry to take ad-,67
NA,vantage of the improved market situation,67
NA,around Australia. What they most certainly,67
NA,"do not want, which would undermine the",67
NA,potential for progress and development in the,67
NA,"wool industry, would be a return of a Labor",67
NA,government; a return to the same sort of,67
NA,"policies- high interest rates, high taxes-",67
NA,"And, as and the sort of regime that damaged",67
NA,Australia's greatest primary industry for such,67
NA,a long period of time. They can now look to,67
NA,the future with confidence as this memory of,67
NA,Labor's failure is finally rolled out the door.,67
NA,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,67
Mr SPEAKER,I inform the House that,67
NA,we have present in the gallery this afternoon,67
NA,"Dr Ivo Sanader, the Vice-Chairman of the",67
NA,Parliamentary Committee for Foreign Affairs,67
NA,in the Croatian parliament. On behalf of all,67
NA,"parliamentarians, I extend to Dr Sanader a",67
NA,very warm welcome to the Parliament of,67
NA,"Honourable members-Hear, hear!",67
NA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,67
NA,Workplace Relations: Workers',67
NA,Entitlements,67
Mr BEAZLEY ,2.57 p.m.)-My question,67
NA,"is to the Minister for Employment, Work-",67
NA,place Relations and Small Business. I go,67
NA,again to the question that I asked previously,67
NA,"which was not answered, and it has nothing",67
NA,to do with Manusafe.,67
Mr SPEAKER,The Leader of the Op-,67
NA,position should come to his question.,67
Mr BEAZLEY,My question is this: will,67
NA,"you confirm that, as a result of the deal ne-",67
NA,"gotiated between Tristar and its workers, the",67
NA,employer is required to pay 1.5 per cent of,67
NA,their payroll for an insurance bond which,67
NA,over two years costs $1.4 million? Isn't it,67
NA,also a fact that under Labor's employee enti-,67
NA,"tlements scheme, employers will be required",67
NA,to pay just an additional 0.1 per cent on their,67
NA,"superannuation contributions-that is,",67
NA,"$23,000? Minister, why are you forcing em-",67
NA,ployers to suffer industrial disputes and to,67
NA,pay more-,67
Mr SPEAKER,The Leader of the Op-,67
NA,position is now entering into an argument.,67
Mr BEAZLEY,when under our plan the,67
NA,scheme will be legislated and employers will,67
NA,pay substantially less? That is not argument;,67
NA,it is a simple proposition.,67
Mr ABBOTT,Labor's scheme to pro-,67
NA,tect entitlements is Manusafe. That is the,67
NA,scheme that is being promoted by the Leader,67
NA,"of the Opposition's friend Dougie Cameron,",68
NA,Dougie Cameron's mate over there-,68
NA,Mr Adams interjecting-,68
Mr SPEAKER,The member for Lyons,68
NA,will withdraw that statement.,68
NA,"Mr Adams-I withdraw, Mr Speaker.",68
NA,"Mr MCMullan-I raise a point of order,",68
NA,Mr Speaker. The House of Representatives,68
NA,Practice at page 477 makes it clear that lan-,68
NA,guage likely to create disorder is unparlia-,68
NA,mentary-,68
NA,Government members interjecting-,68
Mr SPEAKER,I will deal with mem-,68
NA,bers on my right! The Manager of Opposi-,68
NA,tion Business has the call; he has the right to,68
NA,be heard.,68
NA,Mr MCMullan-It derives from the same,68
NA,House of Commons Practice which led you,68
NA,to rule the Leader of the Opposition's ques-,68
NA,"tion out of order, Mr Speaker. If there is one",68
NA,"thing that is likely to provoke disorder, it",68
NA,deliberate lie like that just told by the minis-,68
NA,ter. He knows it is not true and he continues,68
NA,to repeat it. If he did not know that it was not,68
NA,true when he first came into the House-al-,68
NA,"though I believe that he did-he knows now,",68
NA,and it is also irrelevant to the question. He,68
NA,has deliberately misled the House and lied.,68
Mr SPEAKER,The Manager of Oppo-,68
NA,sition Business will resume his seat. He has,68
NA,made his point of order.,68
NA,Ms Hoare interjecting-,68
Mr SPEAKER,The member for Charl-,68
NA,ton is warned!,68
NA,"Mr Reith-I raise a point of order, Mr",68
NA,Speaker. The allegation of a deliberate lie is,68
NA,clearly in breach of the instruction and ad-,68
NA,"vice that you gave to the House earlier today,",68
NA,and I ask that it be withdrawn. It is totally,68
NA,unparliamentary given the advices that you,68
NA,have provided.,68
NA,Mr MCMullan-I withdraw the allega-,68
NA,tion that he deliberately misled the House.,68
Mr SPEAKER,I thank the Manager of,68
NA,Opposition Business.,68
Mr ABBOTT,I was asked about La-,68
NA,"bor's entitlements policy. It is Manusafe, the",68
NA,"policy of Dougie Cameron, the Leader of the",68
NA,Opposition's mate.,68
NA,Honourable members interjecting-,68
NA,Mr Laurie Ferguson interjecting-,68
Mr SPEAKER,This parliament-if the,68
NA,member for Reid has some difficulty with,68
NA,"this, he may excuse himself if he wishes-",68
NA,"has survived and has, in fact, thrived over",68
NA,100 years on the basis that anyone could,68
NA,come in here and state whatever they,68
NA,believed to be the truth and in the national,68
NA,interest. If anyone believed that they were,68
NA,"misleading the House they, too, were free to",68
NA,be called to put their point of view. It is the,68
NA,responsibility of the occupier of the chair.,68
NA,"The minister, obviously, has an obligation to",68
NA,respond in a manner that he believes is,68
NA,"truthful, as do all other members. Whether",68
NA,the response is consistent with what others,68
NA,may believe is not a matter over which the,68
NA,chair has jurisdiction. The chair's obligation,68
NA,is to ensure that everyone can put their point,68
NA,of view and be heard. Chorusing runs,68
NA,is a counter to all that the standing orders stand,68
NA,"for, that is, the right to be heard in silence. I",68
NA,expect every occupier of the House to,68
NA,exercise courtesy and not to be provocative,68
NA,in the way in which they address the House.,68
NA,So do all other occupiers of the chair. So do,68
NA,all Australians. So do all members on the,68
NA,floor. The minister has concluded his answer.,68
NA,Mr Crean-He could not get the lie up so,68
NA,he had to sit down.,68
Mr SPEAKER,The member for Par-,68
NA,ramatta will resume his seat. The Deputy,68
NA,Leader of the Opposition is warned.,68
NA,Families: Policy,68
Mr LLOYD ,3.04 p.m.)-My question is,68
NA,addressed to the Minister for Community,68
NA,Services. Would the minister outline any in-,68
NA,novative policies to build stronger families,68
NA,and stronger communities across Australia?,68
NA,Is the minister aware of any other policies to,68
NA,help Australian families?,68
NA,"Mr Leo MCLeay-I raise a point of order,",68
NA,Mr Speaker. I put it to you that the question,68
NA,is out of order. The member asked the min-,68
NA,ister to outline innovative policies.,68
Mr SPEAKER,The Chief Opposition,68
NA,"Whip raises a point of order, but, in fact, as",68
NA,"members are aware, what the minister may",68
NA,not do is announce policy; he is able to,68
NA,elaborate on policy. I will listen to the min-,69
NA,ister's answer to ensure that he is doing that.,69
NA,"Mr Leo MCLeay-I raise a point of order,",69
NA,Mr Speaker. The standing orders provide that,69
NA,a member cannot ask a minister to announce,69
NA,policy. The member asked the minister to,69
NA,outline innovative policies. If that is not,69
NA,"nouncing policy, I do not know what is.",69
Mr SPEAKER,I point out to the Chief,69
NA,"Opposition Whip that, if the policy has al-",69
NA,"ready been announced, then the minister",69
NA,"would not be, in fact, announcing policy,",69
NA,which is the way in which the standing order,69
NA,is structured. I will listen for the answer.,69
Mr ANTHONY,I thank the member for,69
NA,"Robertson, who has a very keen interest in",69
NA,"supporting families, as indeed do all of the",69
NA,coalition. We would like to see an innovative,69
NA,policy from the opposition-we would like,69
NA,"to see just one. We wait for a policy, and so",69
NA,do the Australian public. But certainly this,69
NA,government is getting on with the job of pro-,69
NA,"viding a better deal for Australian families,",69
NA,"and we are very proud of that. Firstly, the",69
NA,Howard-Anderson government is providing,69
NA,good economic management through lower,69
NA,"interest rates, and by providing the lowest",69
NA,"inflation we have had for decades, making",69
NA,home ownership far more affordable and,69
NA,increasing employment. But one of the,69
NA,greatest achievements is in the area of family,69
NA,assistance where over 2.2 million Australian,69
NA,families-four million children-now re-,69
NA,ceive 20 per cent more in family assistance,69
NA,than they ever would have got under the,69
NA,Australian Labor Party.,69
NA,You have to also ask yourself about child,69
NA,care. I have not had one question on child,69
NA,care from the opposition in the last 12,69
NA,"months. They are silent, and why? Because",69
NA,we have a terrific story to tell on child care.,69
NA,Child care today is nine per cent cheaper,69
NA,"than it was 12 months ago, and the reason for",69
NA,that is the introduction of the new taxation,69
NA,system and the increased affordability of,69
NA,child care. But the opposition have not asked,69
NA,one question. They are very opportunistic,69
NA,about child care but they have not asked one,69
NA,question.,69
NA,This graph says it all. It is a very good,69
NA,document put out by Family and Community,69
NA,Services which shows a significant increase,69
NA,in the funding of child care. Thirty per cent,69
NA,more has been spent on child care than in the,69
NA,last four years of the Labor government. In-,69
NA,"deed, over the next four years, $6 billion will",69
NA,be spent on child care. That is why it has,69
NA,"anbecome far more affordable, and that is why",69
NA,"today, as opposed to a year ago when there",69
NA,"were 450,000 children in Commonwealth",69
NA,"funded child care, there are 700,000 children",69
NA,in child care.,69
NA,The New South Wales Labor government,69
NA,have not increased funding for preschools,69
NA,since the day they were elected. Shame on,69
NA,them. They have frozen funding for pre-,69
NA,schools since they came into government,69
NA,back in the mid-1990s. And they claim that,69
NA,they are the family-friendly party. They are,69
NA,not that at all. Of course they have got no,69
NA,credibility.,69
NA,Mr Albanese interjecting-,69
Mr SPEAKER,The member for,69
NA,Grayndler is warned!,69
Mr ANTHONY,Another area where,69
NA,this government has a proud record is in our,69
NA,"Reconnect program to help young families,",69
NA,whether it is trying to keep families together,69
NA,through our Stronger Families and Commu-,69
NA,nities Strategy or the fight that we have,69
NA,against drugs-and we know that the oppo-,69
NA,sition's policy is totally flim-flam on that,69
NA,"issue. Some people are asking, ‘Where is",69
NA,Labor's plan to help Australian families?' I,69
NA,"did find a plan, which quite surprised me.",69
NA,Labor's plan came straight from the Leader,69
NA,"of the Opposition himself, when he said, ‘My",69
NA,plan is to be in the Lodge.' That is the only,69
NA,plan he has.,69
Mr HOWARD ,What?,69
Mr ANTHONY,"His one plan is, ‘My",69
NA,plan is to be in the Lodge.' Don't pack your,69
NA,"bags just yet, Leader of the Opposition.",69
NA,When the shadow Treasurer addressed Mis-,69
NA,"sion Australia recently, he announced a four-",69
NA,"point plan, and this is his four-point plan.",69
NA,"Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Speaker, I raise a",69
NA,point of order on relevance. The minister,69
NA,was asked for an innovative policy; we have,69
NA,not heard one yet.,69
Mr SPEAKER,The Chief Opposition,69
NA,Whip does not have a point of order.,69
Mr ANTHONY,I think you had better,70
NA,"get back on your bike, Leo. This is the four-",70
NA,point plan as articulated by the shadow,70
NA,Treasurer in his address to Mission Australia,70
NA,recently. It is Labor's four-point plan which,70
NA,is meant to be family friendly. Point 1 is big,70
NA,"budget deficits. That is all they know, as eviadoption",70
NA,denced by the $80 billion deficit that we in-,70
NA,herited and that Australian families have to,70
NA,pay for. Point 2 is raising taxes and crippling,70
NA,"interest rates, which put many Australian",70
NA,families out of their homes. When the Leader,70
NA,"of the Opposition was the finance minister,",70
NA,interest rates were 17 per cent. Point 3 is,70
NA,raising unemployment to massive levels.,70
NA,"Point 4, most importantly, is do not upset the",70
NA,"unions because they pay the bills, and we",70
NA,have seen that demonstrated very amply in,70
NA,the recent motor industry dispute.,70
NA,Workplace Relations: Workers',70
NA,Entitlements,70
Mr BEAZLEY ,3.11 p.m.)-My question,70
NA,"is to the Minister for Employment, Work-",70
NA,place Relations and Small Business. Minis-,70
NA,"ter, isn't it the case that there are thousands",70
NA,of companies in Australia that have enter-,70
NA,prise agreements that are about to expire but,70
NA,that do not have protection for 100 per cent,70
NA,of workers' entitlements? Will every one of,70
NA,these companies and their workers have to,70
NA,go through negotiations which may turn into,70
NA,long and bitter industrial disputes before,70
NA,workers can get security for 100 per cent of,70
NA,their legal entitlements under your formula?,70
NA,Isn't the only choice you leave the Australian,70
NA,community this: our plan for a national em-,70
NA,ployee entitlements scheme or your plan for,70
NA,a Tristar dispute in every factory in Austra-,70
NA,lia?,70
Mr ABBOTT,All those companies to,70
NA,which the Leader of the Opposition refers,70
NA,will go through the kind of bitter industrial,70
NA,disputation to which the Leader of the Oppo-,70
NA,sition refers only if the Leader of the Oppo-,70
NA,sition's friends in the AMWU-his mate,70
NA,Dougie Cameron-force them to. That is the,70
NA,simple truth. I have a letter here addressed,70
NA,Steve Bracks from the chief executive of one,70
NA,"of those companies, Holden. This is one of",70
NA,the companies which is threatened with con-,70
NA,tinuous industrial action by the friends of the,70
NA,"Labor Party and by Dougie Cameron, the",70
NA,Leader of the Opposition's best mate. Mr,70
NA,Hanenberger wrote about one way to address,70
NA,this problem. He said:,70
NA,One avenue by which this could be achieved,70
NA,would be by strengthening the federal govern-,70
NA,ment's employee entitlements scheme through,70
NA,by those states that have not yet done so.,70
NA,The best thing that could happen to defuse,70
NA,this entitlements issue would be if the state,70
NA,Labor governments supported the federal,70
NA,government's entitlements scheme.,70
NA,Forest Products Industry,70
NA,FRAN BAILEY (3.14 p.m.)-My ques-,70
NA,tion is addressed to the Minister for Forestry,70
NA,and Conservation. Would the minister advise,70
NA,what information he has received from,70
NA,around Australia relating to the future ad-,70
NA,ministration and prospects for the forest,70
NA,products industry and its work force?,70
Mr TUCKEY,In reporting to the House,70
NA,"on matters that have arisen, according to the",70
NA,"member's question, I advise the House that",70
NA,the Gallop Labor government in Western,70
NA,Australia has now incorporated its complete,70
NA,Labor Party policy on the forest industries in,70
NA,terms of the closure of that industry. It is,70
NA,well known that that policy had the complete,70
NA,support of the Leader of the Opposition. As a,70
NA,"consequence, there has already been an an-",70
NA,nouncement by the largest employer in the,70
NA,"forestry industry in Western Australia,",70
NA,"Sotico, that there will be 400 redundancies",70
NA,forthwith in that particular industry. A,70
NA,smaller employer of 10 persons has already,70
NA,lost his forest contract and has been obliged,70
NA,to sack all his employees.,70
NA,We have heard question after question to-,70
NA,day about the payment of redundancies. The,70
NA,Gallop government has refused to give any,70
NA,assistance in the payment of redundancies to,70
NA,any of those workers. We are not talking,70
NA,about a company that was in full production,70
NA,"and that could sell all its products, with its",70
NA,employees having security of employment;,70
NA,we are talking about workers who have lost,70
NA,"their jobs because of political expediency, in",70
NA,to which the Leader of the Opposition was to-,70
NA,tally complicit. Those people have not gone,70
NA,back to work; they are finished. They cannot,70
NA,sell their houses. If any apology is needed in,70
NA,"this place today, it is needed from the Leader",70
NA,of the Opposition to those people and their,70
NA,families. As for the employer who had to,71
NA,"sack all 10 of his employees, three of those",71
NA,people have got redundancy assistance.,71
NA,But there are other activities going on,71
NA,around Australia-and it is pretty interesting.,71
NA,You can run in this place but you cannot,71
NA,"hide. I find in the North Eastern Advertiser, a",71
NA,newspaper published in the remoter parts of,71
NA,"Tasmania, that Senator Kerry O'Brien ad-",71
NA,vised in a letter that the Senate passed the,71
NA,government's RFA legislation last year. That,71
NA,"is pretty surprising, because I have the Han-",71
NA,sard record showing every Tasmanian mem-,71
NA,ber voting against it. But to help me out on,71
NA,"this matter, just two weeks later in the Burnie",71
NA,"Advocate, the shadow minister Mr Ferguson",71
NA,is entreating me to reintroduce the bill.,71
NA,Mr Anderson-Did he talk to a newspa-,71
NA,per?,71
Mr TUCKEY,"Yes, he did. We have it",71
NA,here in the newspaper. What is the Labor,71
NA,"Party up to? Here we are, Mr Deputy Prime",71
NA,Minister-,71
Mr SPEAKER,The minister will ad-,71
NA,dress his remarks through the chair.,71
Mr TUCKEY,"Thank you, Mr Speaker,",71
NA,and I will-but that is not all. During the,71
NA,"recess, the Leader of the Opposition decided",71
NA,"to visit Eden-Monaro, and station 5AN in",71
NA,Adelaide had an interview with the Bulletin's,71
NA,Tony Wright relating to this visit. During that,71
NA,visit the Leader of the Opposition was out,71
NA,"with his members, signing, with a big black",71
NA,"pen, pledges to guarantee that he would not",71
NA,sell Telstra. I do not know how big a signa-,71
NA,ture there was on the letter to the Common-,71
NA,"wealth Bank employees union but, as I re-",71
NA,member-being a member of this place at,71
NA,the time-there was a signature promising,71
NA,never to sell more than 49 per cent of the,71
NA,Commonwealth Bank.,71
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,71
Mr SPEAKER,The member for Brad-,71
NA,don is warned!,71
Mr TUCKEY,"But, after the signing, Mr",71
NA,"Tony Wright of the Bulletin, talking of the",71
NA,"Leader of the Opposition, told 5AN's Philip",71
NA,Satchell as follows:,71
NA,"Yesterday he was in Eden-Monaro, which is not",71
NA,far from Canberra ...,71
NA,"He was, as I said, signing these Telstra guar-",71
NA,antees. But Mr Wright goes on to say:,71
NA,"Interestingly, Green groups came with a very",71
NA,similar pledge asking him to sign that forests,71
NA,"would be protected. But, of course, Eden-Monaro",71
NA,is one of those areas where there are a lot of for-,71
NA,est workers and he wasn't going to get into that at,71
NA,"all. ... But, when asked to sign the one on the for-",71
NA,ests of Eden-Monaro he put away the big black,71
NA,pen and got out the prolixity again.,71
NA,I wish I had the time in this place to read the,71
NA,convoluted remarks.,71
NA,Government members interjecting-,71
Mr TUCKEY,"Yes, you can run but you",71
NA,cannot hide in this place. He has got a mes-,71
NA,sage in one place and he would not sign.,71
NA,But it gets worse because in many parts of,71
NA,"Australia, particularly those associated with",71
NA,"the pulp and paper industry, there has been",71
NA,an advocate group of workers known as the,71
NA,A-Team. They have done a wonderful job,71
NA,"coming to my office and members' offices,",71
NA,asking for all assistance necessary to main-,71
NA,tain a pulp and paper industry in Australia,71
NA,and all the employment that goes with it.,71
NA,One of those areas can be found in the seat,71
NA,"of Braddon, another can be found in the seat",71
NA,of Gilmore and still another can be found in,71
NA,the seat of MCMillan. These people have,71
NA,now been heavied by the CFMEU to dis-,71
NA,"band, and they thought they might need to",71
NA,get a bit of help from their local member of,71
NA,parliament. They have written to me:,71
NA,"This is particularly relevant, given the unusual",71
NA,special relationship between the CFMEU and our,71
NA,"local federal MP, Christian Zahra, which resulted",71
NA,from the union's generous financial support for,71
NA,"him at the last election. Since his election, Mr",71
NA,Zahra has steadfastly refused to meet our delega-,71
NA,"tions on important issues, which have impacted",71
NA,"on the MCMillan electorate. Further, he has ex-",71
NA,"tended this ban on any of his constituents, who",71
NA,have happened to be members of the Maryvale A-,71
NA,Team.,71
NA,"This is in black and white, signed by a",71
NA,worker living in Maryvale in the MCMillan,71
NA,electorate.,71
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,71
Mr TUCKEY,I think he is now calling,71
NA,this fellow a liar.,71
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,71
Mr TUCKEY,Now he says I am a liar.,71
Mr SPEAKER,The minister will ad-,72
NA,dress his remarks through the chair and not,72
NA,respond to interjections.,72
Mr TUCKEY,Everything I have drawn,72
NA,to the attention of the House today is some-,72
NA,body else's words. We have got Kerry,72
NA,O'Brien dreaming: he actually lives in the,72
NA,Senate and thought he had passed the bill. He,72
NA,did not. We have got the shadow minister,72
NA,"now thinking, ‘Golly, gosh, we've offended",72
NA,all these workers and the election is getting,72
NA,close. I wonder if I can sneak down to Tas-,72
NA,mania and win a few of them back. I'll tell,72
NA,them I love them.' Then the Leader of the,72
NA,"Opposition gets into Eden-Monaro, and what",72
NA,does he do? He is asked to sign a pledge. He,72
NA,was prepared to kill off a thousand jobs in,72
NA,"Western Australia to win that election, but",72
NA,when he thinks he might pick up the most,72
NA,marginal seat in the federal election and the,72
NA,"greenies say, ‘Will you sign a pledge for the",72
NA,forest?' he reverts to prolixity. He starts,72
NA,talking. Then we get a person who stood up,72
NA,in this place telling us how committed he is,72
NA,"to his electorate but, when a group of inde-",72
NA,"pendent workers, who get access to my of-",72
NA,"fice as a minister whenever they want it,",72
NA,tried to get into his office to tell him their,72
NA,"troubles, he was not going to put his CFMEU",72
NA,funding at risk: he would not let them in.,72
NA,Workplace Relations: Workers',72
NA,Entitlements,72
Mr BEAZLEY ,3.24 p.m.)-My question,72
NA,"is to the Minister for Employment, Work-",72
NA,place Relations and Small Business. Minis-,72
NA,"ter, given your refusal to implement a na-",72
NA,tional employee entitlement scheme that,72
NA,covers 100 per cent of employees' entitle-,72
NA,"ments, aren't you ensuring that thousands of",72
NA,Australian companies will have to negotiate,72
NA,insurance bonds and other arrangements at,72
NA,more than 60 times the cost to them of La-,72
NA,bor's employee entitlements scheme? Again,72
NA,I ask: why are you forcing employers to suf-,72
NA,fer industrial disputes and to pay more under,72
NA,your formula when under our plan the,72
NA,scheme will be legislated and employers will,72
NA,pay substantially less?,72
Mr ABBOTT,I am trying to protect the,72
NA,businesses of this country from industry-,72
NA,wide pattern bargaining in support of,72
NA,Manusafe instigated by the friend of the La-,72
NA,"bor Party, the member of the Labor Party, the",72
NA,"mate of the Leader of the Opposition, Dou-",72
NA,gie Cameron. That is what I am trying to do:,72
NA,"protect the good, decent workers and their",72
NA,employers of this country from the ravages,72

NA,Motion of Censure,72
Mr BEAZLEY ,Brand-Leader of the,72
NA,Opposition) (3.25 p.m.)-by leave-I move:,72
NA,That this House censure the Minister for Em-,72
NA,"ployment, Workplace Relations and Small Busi-",72
NA,ness for his:,72
NA,"(1) irresponsible, inflammatory and deliberately",72
NA,provocative intervention in the Tristar dis-,72
NA,pute;,72
NA,(2) calling fellow Australians “traitors” simply,72
NA,for conducting themselves within the in-,72
NA,dustrial framework established by the Coa-,72
NA,lition Government;,72
NA,(3) placing the job security of every single,72
NA,Australian worker at risk due to his ideo-,72
NA,logical and dogmatic approach to workplace,72
NA,relations;,72
NA,(4) exposing the economy to potentially thou-,72
NA,sands of enterprise-level disputes over the,72
NA,issue of securing legal employee entitle-,72
NA,ments through his failure to put in place a,72
NA,comprehensive system which protects 100%,72
NA,of employees entitlements;,72
NA,(5) incompetent administration of the Job Net-,72
NA,work system which is increasingly being,72
NA,marked by claims of fraud and rorting by,72
NA,providers seeking to comply with the Gov-,72
NA,ernment's injunction to focus on numerical,72
NA,"outcomes, not jobs in the Job Network;",72
NA,(6) presiding over huge drops in full-time em-,72
NA,ployment;,72
NA,(7) use of his office to solely focus on generat-,72
NA,ing political advantage for the Liberal Party,72
NA,and his complete disregard for the living,72
NA,standards and economic security of Austra-,72
NA,lian families; and,72
NA,(8) general unfitness to occupy the office of a,72
NA,Commonwealth Minister.,72
NA,There is no question at all that this minister,73
NA,has as an intention to inflame industrial dis-,73
NA,putation around this country as a cover for,73
NA,the inability of his colleagues in this gov-,73
NA,ernment to get an election campaign success-,73
NA,fully organised around the record of this,73
NA,"government, when they know that every",73
NA,Australian understands that the government,73
NA,has targeted them to bear the burden of the,73
NA,"taxation system, intends to Americanise the",73
NA,"health care system, intends to run down the",73
NA,"public school system, does not give a darn",73
NA,about those in aged care and will leave them,73
NA,"inadequately protected, and that this is not",73
NA,something on which they can run. It is the,73
NA,intention of this minister and the reason for,73
NA,"his use of inflammatory language and,",73
NA,"frankly, his frequent lying, as we have seen",73
NA,in this chamber here today-,73
NA,Government members interjecting-,73
Mr BEAZLEY,This is a censure mo-,73
NA,"tion. His frequent lying, as we have seen in",73
NA,this chamber today-,73
Mr SPEAKER,Order! A censure mo-,73
NA,tion does not allow the Leader of the Oppo-,73
NA,sition to make that accusation. I ask him to,73
NA,withdraw it.,73
Mr BEAZLEY,"I withdraw, and I sub-",73
NA,"stitute ‘his constant, deliberate untruths',",73
NA,which we have seen reflected here in this,73
NA,chamber today. Recollect the way he an-,73
NA,swered every one of those questions. He has,73
NA,no argument. He has no argument at all that,73
NA,stands up. When he sees what he inflicts on,73
NA,"employers in this country, he has no argu-",73
NA,ment against the Labor Party's scheme-,73
NA,"cheap, certain, total coverage, with no",73
NA,industrial disputation to arrive at it. He has,73
NA,"no argument against that, so therefore he has",73
NA,to falsely accuse the Labor Party for,73
NA,ostensibly going around advocating a scheme,73
NA,which is rendered essential or is out there in,73
NA,the ether because huge numbers of people in,73
NA,this country do not feel that their life savings,73
NA,are being adequately protected.,73
NA,"This is the same minister who, when he",73
NA,"had the same portfolio in a lesser position,",73
NA,described the St Vincent de Paul Society as,73
NA,ignorant in their understanding of poverty.,73
NA,This is the same minister who in the junior,73
NA,version of this portfolio came out and ac-,73
NA,"cused the unemployed, in a situation of fal-",73
NA,"ling job opportunities, of being in the cir-",73
NA,cumstances in which they found themselves,73
NA,because they were job snobs. That is his,73
NA,view. This is the same minister who has,73
NA,wandered about this country breaching the,73
NA,unemployed in a fashion which has ensured,73
NA,that some of those who are doing things,73
NA,hardest in this country have virtually nothing,73
NA,to live on. And he is the stalking horse for,73
NA,"this Prime Minister, so everything that he has",73
NA,"done, the calumnies he has heaped on the",73
NA,heads of ordinary Australians and the most,73
NA,"vulnerable in the society, are at the direct",73
NA,behest of the Prime Minister of this country.,73
NA,He says things in public that the Prime Min-,73
NA,ister believes but does not dare say.,73
NA,He knows that this Prime Minister is,73
NA,about to be called to account. He is about to,73
NA,be called to account for his deceit on the,73
NA,Australian electorate when he said he would,73
NA,"never, ever implement a GST. He is about to",73
NA,be called to account for his deceit when he,73
NA,said that no Australian worker in the indus-,73
NA,trial relations system they were putting in,73
NA,place would be worse off. He is going to be,73
NA,called to account for his deceit when he said,73
NA,that he would preserve Medicare when his,73
NA,whole policy has been directed at under-,73
NA,mining it and producing instead a situation,73
NA,where our health care system is being,73
NA,Americanised. He knows the Prime Minister,73
NA,cannot answer these things on the campaign,73
NA,trail and failure to answer them in normal,73
NA,circumstances will mean defeat.,73
NA,How do you get round it? There is a time-,73
NA,honoured Liberal party tradition: shift the,73
NA,"agenda, cover it with a darn good ‘reds under",73
NA,the bed' campaign and focus that on indus-,73
NA,trial disputation. Every employer in this,73
NA,country knows that they will be hassled by,73
NA,this minister when they enter into a period of,73
NA,negotiation with their employees not to settle,73
NA,but to provoke every dispute to run through,73
NA,to a complete confrontation with the indus-,73
NA,trial relations system and place the workers,73
NA,at variance with directions of the Industrial,73
NA,Relations Commission so that the onus can,73
NA,be turned on to them as they are out there,73
NA,fighting for their legitimate rights.,73
NA,Do not forget that during the course of this,73
NA,"dispute, when the issue was tightly con-",73
NA,"tested, when the workers had indicated, as",74
NA,they always do in any industrial relations,74
NA,"dispute, an intention to compromise and",74
NA,"started to move in that direction, the minister",74
NA,"for industrial relations said, ‘Don't compro-",74
NA,mise!' Understand the context of that ‘Don't,74
NA,compromise!' beyond what I have already,74
NA,just stated. That was a part of the dispute,74
NA,when the workers were shifting ground. Un-,74
NA,derstand that that ‘Don't compromise!',74
NA,stands at variance with part of the defensive,74
NA,cloud that he put out in January this year,74
NA,around his own proposition in relation to,74
NA,protection of workers' entitlements.,74
NA,The workers in Tristar were following the,74
NA,instructions of the minister to the letter. Let,74
NA,me quote from the minister's pamphlet. He,74
NA,"put it out, of course, in that context because",74
NA,he realised that any worker looking at the,74
NA,full-blown implications of the entitlements,74
NA,package put together by this minister and his,74
NA,predecessors knew that waste would be laid,74
NA,to their entitlements should ever their com-,74
NA,panies go under. So what did this minister,74
NA,say? He said this:,74
NA,[This] does not preclude the adoption of addi-,74
NA,"tional measures, by particular employers and",74
NA,ployees. ... such an approach would place the,74
NA,obligation directly on the employer concerned,74
NA,and could deliver 100 per cent of what is owed to,74
NA,the employee.,74
NA,What sort of schemes would those be? Those,74
NA,schemes would be the type of scheme that,74
NA,ultimately was adopted by the workers and,74
NA,the company to conclude this dispute. They,74
NA,"would also include, by the way, Manusafe.",74
NA,In what way is Manusafe at variance with,74
NA,any of this? In no way at all.,74
NA,"This man, at the beginning of this year,",74
NA,stood up in public and effectively suggested,74
NA,"to all workers, ‘Get your schemes together.",74
NA,Go out there and negotiate what it is you can,74
NA,"get.' Now, in some circumstances that will",74
NA,"emerge in relation to insurance bonds, but",74
NA,there is nothing in this that talks about it,74
NA,"simply being insurance bonds. Of course, in",74
NA,other circumstances it would be the type of,74
NA,schemes outlined by the AMWU on,74
NA,Manusafe. It ill behoves him to come into,74
NA,this place now and suggest that the circum-,74
NA,stances that have occurred are anything other,74
NA,than what he cut loose at the beginning of,74
NA,this year. There is no prescription in this;,74
NA,what there is in this is disaster.,74
NA,Around this country now-and not just in,74
NA,factories where the AMWU is the predomi-,74
NA,"nant union-in a multiplicity of workplaces,",74
NA,agreements are coming up for renegotiation.,74
NA,Those agreements for renegotiation come,74
NA,under the government's own industrial rela-,74
NA,"tions system, which protects strike action in",74
NA,"certain bargaining contexts, and so it is al-",74
NA,most invariably going to be the case where,74
NA,management does not agree with the workers,74
NA,and vice versa that that protected period is,74
NA,"going to be entertained, to the very consider-",74
NA,able damage potentially of the Australian,74
NA,economy as these employers and employees,74
NA,are forced to work their way through the,74
NA,consequences of this government's policy.,74
NA,The cost of that can be seen in what we,74
NA,have already seen in the case of Tristar: $1.5,74
NA,million over two years is what this will cost,74
NA,"the employer in that case, versus the $23,000",74
NA,that it would cost the employer for a scheme,74
NA,that covers all. Why is it so much cheaper?,74
NA,Obviously because everybody is in it. The,74
NA,"thousands of companies around Australia,",74
NA,em- virtually all of which will survive cheerfully,74
NA,"for decades and decades, will cover the in-",74
NA,"surance costs of those that go under, but they",74
NA,will do so very cheaply indeed. And no com-,74
NA,pany can guarantee that they will not be,74
NA,numbered amongst that small minority at,74
NA,some point of time in the history of their,74
NA,company's activities over the decades.,74
NA,"There is a solution, but it is not a solution",74
NA,wanted by this minister. This minister wants,74
NA,a fight. This minister makes a confession to,74
NA,every gathering that he addresses in the in-,74
NA,dustrial relations area. We talk to the same,74
NA,businessmen that they do. He wanders fre-,74
NA,quently into his address to employers at Lib-,74
NA,"eral Party fundraisers and the like, always",74
NA,starting with this winning sentence: ‘Every-,74
NA,body in this room knows more about indus-,74
NA,trial relations than I do.' That is the only,74
NA,honest statement he makes in the entirety of,74
NA,"his address. Indeed, they do. What no-one in",74
NA,that room wants is the minister's agenda that,74
NA,underpins that. He does not care about his,74
NA,ignorance of the industrial relations system.,74
NA,He does not care about his complete lack of,74
NA,understanding of the lives and lifestyles of,74
NA,ordinary Australians and what they depend,75
NA,upon. All he cares about is organising a fight,75
NA,to cover the unpopularity of his boss and the,75
NA,impossibility of his boss's circumstances as,75
NA,the electorate gradually comes to grips with,75
NA,the consequences of the policies that they,75
NA,have been subjected to over the course of the,75
NA,last five years.,75
NA,I have not seen-even under the regime of,75
NA,"Peter Reith, full of conspiracy though it was",75
NA,against the rights of ordinary workers in this,75
NA,country-any minister of this or any other,75
NA,government stand up and describe a group of,75
NA,his fellow Australians as traitors for taking,75
NA,lawful industrial action. In factories around,75
NA,this country there are workers who have,75
NA,served this country in wartime who do not,75
NA,have protection of their entitlements to the,75
NA,tune of 100 per cent and who expect that,75
NA,their unions will pursue the directions of Ab-,75
NA,bott to secure 100 per cent coverage of their,75
NA,entitlements through the industrial relations,75
NA,"system. And he calls them, if they pursue",75
NA,"those positions, traitors.",75
NA,That is his role: to insult ordinary working,75
NA,Australians in this country. Let me tell you,75
NA,what is at stake for them. We will go to the,75
NA,"case that we named specifically at Tristar, of",75
NA,a worker of 30 years in that factory. You,75
NA,know what workers of 30 years are like-,75
NA,they are the skilled workers that keep the,75
NA,engine of Australian industry going. These,75
NA,are the men and women who have built up,75
NA,over years and years of experience the,75
NA,capacity to fix the problems in their,75
NA,train the junior workers and to ensure that,75
NA,the productive system of this country,75
NA,proceeds in a way that generates the wealth,75
NA,to pay the personal entitlements of that,75
NA,minister opposite. Those people are,75
NA,described as traitors. In the particular,75
NA,"instance that we cited, that gentleman had",75
NA,"$122,000 worth of entitlements-",75
NA,Opposition members-Marty Peek.,75
Mr BEAZLEY,"That is right, Marty",75
NA,"Peek. He had $122,000 worth of entitle-",75
NA,"ments. He is the epitome of the skilled, long",75
NA,"serving, loyal Australian worker. He was",75
NA,loyal to that company. These are the sorts of,75
NA,men and women that perform that essential,75
NA,task not only in the workplace but in our so-,75
NA,ciety. They are the men and women you find,75
NA,manning the SES voluntary posts when,75
NA,"bushfires come about, organising the Little",75
NA,Athletics on a Saturday morning and ensur-,75
NA,ing by their voluntary endeavours that our,75
NA,"community works. They are solid, intelli-",75
NA,"gent, working class, skilled Australians. And",75
NA,what is the reward for Mr Marty Peek if this,75
NA,minister has his way-the man the minister,75
NA,described as a traitor? What is the reward,75
NA,from this flaneur for Mr Marty Peek? The,75
NA,"reward is that, if Tristar goes under, Mr",75
NA,"Marty Peek will have secured $20,000. He is",75
NA,"47 years old, and he knows that under the",75
NA,policies of this government- which have,75
NA,completely collapsed full-time employment,75
NA,"in this country, with record collapse of full-",75
NA,time employment in the course of the last,75
NA,month-his chance of a full-time job from,75
NA,this point on is negligible.,75
NA,Those rotten figures that we have seen,75
NA,"over the course of the last year or two, last",75
NA,"year in particular, on full-time jobs-and it",75
NA,has to be said their performance was not all,75
NA,"that great before then, but what was not a",75
NA,great performance has become a disastrous,75
NA,performance-are what is driving one of,75
NA,"those awful statistics in this country, which",75
NA,sees us now as a nation where men in their,75
NA,fifties have the lowest participation rate in,75
NA,the workforce in the Western world. We,75
NA,know this: if he is sacked and has to go,75
NA,"without his entitlements, that $122,000 is all",75
NA,he has got to pay off his mortgage and all he,75
NA,has got to sustain his retirement. But Mr Ab-,75
NA,"bott does not give a darn, because Marty",75
NA,"firms, to Peek is an opportunity.",75
NA,Marty Peek is not a human being; he is a,75
NA,political opportunity for this minister to,75
NA,"cover for his worthless Prime Minister, who",75
NA,does not have the basic intestinal fortitude to,75
NA,do his own dirty work when it comes to,75
NA,dealing with the public and when it comes to,75
NA,dealing with St Vincent de Paul. This Prime,75
NA,"Minister clearly hates them, but he would not",75
NA,dare say it because there would be a royal,75
NA,"public reaction, so he sends Mr Abbott in to",75
NA,"tell St Vincent de Paul, one of the most ef-",75
NA,"fective charities in this community, that they",75
NA,are in fact ignorant of the issues of poverty in,75
NA,this country. Mr Abbott does it; the Prime,75
NA,Minister does not. The Prime Minister does,75
NA,not want to be connected with a statement,75
NA,that the unemployed who can find no work,75
NA,in a country where full-time employment has,76
NA,collapsed only fail to do so because they are,76
NA,job snobs. The Prime Minister would dearly,76
NA,"love to say that, but he has his dirty work",76
NA,merchant to do it instead-this minister op-,76
NA,posite. He is out there to deliver the insults,76
NA,and to inflame the situation-that is his job.,76
NA,This is not how Australia is meant to be.,76
NA,This is not how Australia is meant to be gov-,76
NA,erned. This is not how Australians will have,76
NA,restored to them a sense of security.,76
NA,We have had good growth in this commu-,76
NA,nity over the course of the last eight years.,76
NA,We have had good growth until last year. We,76
NA,have good growth on the hard yards made by,76
NA,"the Labor Party when we were in office, of",76
NA,which the government has been the benefici-,76
NA,"ary. These days as I go around, one comment",76
NA,"is made to me constantly, ‘If the economy is",76
NA,"so good, why don't I and my family feel it?'",76
NA,They do not feel it. The increasing inequality,76
NA,in our society continues apace. One of the,76
NA,significant influences on that increasing ine-,76
NA,quality is the operation of the industrial,76
NA,"tions system, put in place by this govern-",76
NA,ment. It has had its most savage effect on,76
NA,"women's wages, but it has had a pretty awe-",76
NA,some impact on the job security of bread-,76
NA,winners of both genders. They do not know,76
NA,whether they will be able to sustain levels of,76
NA,family debt-no matter what the interest,76
NA,rates are- when their employment and their,76
NA,entitlements are not secure. And he has done,76
NA,it!,76
NA,He performed another task. There is not,76
NA,"sufficient time for me to go into it, but I",76
NA,say this: it is all unravelling for him now. As,76
NA,this government collapsed employment pro-,76
NA,"grams, which were the only chance for many",76
NA,"people in regional Australia in particular, it",76
NA,introduced measures that it said were alter-,76
NA,natives that would work at about one-tenth of,76
NA,the cost of what was there and working. To,76
NA,"defend intuitively such nonsense, it had to",76
NA,produce a set of statistics. We find now that,76
NA,the way in which the statistics were produced,76
NA,under this minister has induced widespread,76
NA,fraud in the system. They have tumbled. He,76
NA,has been tumbled. The people who have,76
NA,been disbenefited are the most vulnerable in,76
NA,this society. This minister is not fit to hold,76
NA,"office. His undergraduate mentality, his",76
NA,"childish and deceitful attitude, which we",76
NA,"have seen manifest here today, and his",76
NA,worthless insulting attacks on ordinary Aus-,76
NA,tralians deserve his censure and removal.,76
NA,(Time expired),76
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Nehl)-Is,76
NA,the motion seconded?,76
NA,Mr Bevis-I second the censure motion,76
NA,and reserve my right to speak.,76
Mr ABBOTT ,Warringah-Minister for,76
NA,"Employment, Workplace Relations and",76
NA,Small Business) (3.47 p.m.)-We have just,76
NA,seen a rambling and hysterical speech from,76
NA,"the Leader of the Opposition, who has",76
NA,proven today yet again that he cannot handle,76
NA,pressure. Under the pressure of the coming,76
NA,"election campaign, the Leader of the Oppo-",76
NA,sition is revealing something that has been,76
NA,long suspected-a nasty streak which shows,76
NA,a fundamental weakness of character and a,76
NA,fundamental lack of ticker.,76
NA,You have to ask yourself this question:,76
NA,relawhy are members opposite so sensitive?,76
NA,Why are they so affronted by anything that,76
NA,involves the union movement? It is because,76
NA,"the union movement owns them lock, stock",76
NA,and barrel. It owns them heart and soul. The,76
NA,union movement provides every single,76
NA,member of the Labor Party with membership,76
NA,of the union movement. The union move-,76
NA,"ment has produced Labor's frontbench, it has",76
NA,produced their backbench and it has pro-,76
NA,duced their party officials. Sixty per cent of,76
NA,their frontbench are former union officials.,76
NA,"will After the next election, they will have no",76
NA,fewer than three ACTU presidents on their,76
NA,frontbench.,76
NA,In the last year for which figures are,76
NA,"available, the union movement gave the La-",76
NA,bor Party no less than $5 million. The union,76
NA,movement controls 60 per cent of the votes,76
NA,at every Labor Party conference. The dregs,76
NA,of the union movement include people such,76
NA,as the current state secretary of the AMWU,76
NA,"in Victoria, who is currently facing charges",76
NA,of riot and affray arising out of a most ap-,76
NA,palling incident at a factory in Victoria. Yet,76
NA,this is the person who controls the largest,76
NA,bloc vote inside the Victorian Labor Party.,76
NA,Why are members opposite reacting so,76
NA,hysterically? They are reacting the way they,76
NA,are because they know that the union link is,77
NA,"the soft underbelly of the Labor Party, and it",77
NA,is now threatening what they thought was,77
NA,their easy ride to power. The Leader of the,77
NA,Opposition was crying crocodile tears today,77
NA,over the strikes that he thinks will break out,77
NA,at hundreds of factories in the weeks ahead.,77
NA,Let me make it very clear: this government,77
NA,does not support strikes. This government,77
NA,"thinks that strikes should be, at most, an ab-",77
NA,solute last resort. Members opposite support,77
NA,"strikes, and they have demonstrated that time",77
NA,and time again over the last week. This strike,77
NA,at Tristar was supported by the member for,77
NA,"Hotham, the Deputy Leader of the Opposi-",77
NA,tion; it was supported by the member for,77
NA,"Dickson, the shadow minister for employ-",77
NA,ment; and it was never opposed by the,77
NA,Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the,77
NA,Opposition has never opposed Manusafe.,77
NA,"The Leader of the Opposition, for once in his",77
NA,"life, was completely silent during this dispute",77
NA,"on the matters that put 12,000 workers out of",77
NA,work.,77
NA,Let us be very clear what this strike was,77
NA,about. This strike was about Manusafe.,77
NA,Manusafe is not a 1.5 per cent levy on pay-,77
NA,"roll. That is how it started, but it finished",77
NA,19 per cent levy on payroll. Even at 1.5 per,77
NA,"cent of payroll, Manusafe means that the",77
NA,manufacturing industry alone will have to,77
NA,pay $550 million into a fund that is ironclad,77
NA,controlled by the union movement. That will,77
NA,"cost at least 10,000 jobs in the motor indus-",77
NA,try alone.,77
NA,Members opposite have been saying that,77
NA,they do not support Manusafe. Of course,77
NA,they support Manusafe; of course ALP pol-,77
NA,icy supports Manusafe. I am reading from,77
NA,the documents of the ALP conference last,77
NA,year. It says:,77
NA,Employers are not required to make additional,77
NA,payments for benefits already protected by trusts,77
NA,or other appropriate means.,77
NA,"Also in this policy, passed by the Labor",77
NA,"Party conference last year, is support for in-",77
NA,dustry-wide strikes in support of pattern bar-,77
NA,"gaining, such as the industry-wide strike now",77
NA,threatened by the AMWU in support of the,77
NA,Manusafe campaign.,77
NA,Let me make it very clear that workers',77
NA,entitlements deserve protection. Any worker,77
NA,facing the loss of his or her entitlements de-,77
NA,"serves sympathy, help and support. Workers",77
NA,facing the loss of their entitlements are fac-,77
NA,ing one of the gravest calamities that anyone,77
NA,"can face, and they certainly deserve the sup-",77
NA,port of this government-and they have it.,77
NA,This is the first government ever to put in,77
NA,place a scheme to protect workers' entitle-,77
NA,ments.,77
NA,But let us put this problem in perspective.,77
NA,"In any one year, just one-half of one per cent",77
NA,"of businesses go out of business, go broke. In",77
NA,any one year fewer than one-tenth of one per,77
NA,cent of employees lose their jobs because,77
NA,their company has gone out of business.,77
NA,Even fewer than one-tenth of one per cent,77
NA,can expect to lose their entitlements. The,77
NA,beauty of this government's scheme is that it,77
NA,"does not cost jobs, it does not provide any-",77
NA,one with the encouragement to ramp up enti-,77
NA,"tlements and, unlike Labor's scheme-unlike",77
NA,Manusafe-it does not amount to a confis-,77
NA,cation of the working capital of ordinary,77
NA,businesses.,77
NA,Labor's scheme is Manusafe. That is the,77
NA,scheme to which Labor Party policy is ulti-,77
NA,mately directed. That is the scheme that La-,77
NA,as a bor Party policy ultimately supports. But,77
NA,"whether you look at Manusafe, a levy on",77
NA,"payroll of up to 19 per cent, or whether you",77
NA,look at the no-frills scheme sometimes men-,77
NA,"tioned by the Leader of the Opposition, all",77
NA,Labor's schemes amount to a tax on jobs. All,77
NA,Labor's schemes amount to a compulsory,77
NA,"levy on 100 per cent of payroll, 100 per cent",77
NA,"of jobs, to support one-tenth of one per cent",77
NA,of workers who have this entitlement prob-,77
NA,lem. I will now quote from someone who is,77
NA,in a position to know. I will quote from,77
NA,someone whose company is directly threat-,77
NA,ened by the Manusafe campaign now threat-,77
NA,ened against the motor industry and the,77
NA,manufacturing industry and supported to the,77
NA,hilt by members opposite. Peter Hanenber-,77
NA,"ger, the chairman and MD of Holden, said:",77
NA,Implementation of any scheme requiring signifi-,77
NA,cant financial contribution by employers will,77
NA,therefore amount to the imposition of a cost im-,77
NA,post on business which will greatly exceed the,77
NA,quantum of the problem it seeks to address.,77
NA,He also said:,77
NA,"Second, the concept of requiring all businesses",78
NA,those over a certain size to effectively fund the,78
NA,potential failure of the very few rather than,78
NA,viding a government supported safety net to cover,78
NA,"those isolated incidents is, in our view, simply",78
NA,unsustainable.,78
NA,So there you have it: Peter Hanenberger-a,78
NA,boss of a company that is employing tens of,78
NA,thousands of Australians and is generating,78
NA,"hundreds of millions of dollars of sales,",78
NA,which is generating hundreds of millions of,78
NA,dollars of exports every year-says that La-,78
NA,bor's schemes are unsustainable and that,78
NA,there should be a government supported,78
NA,safety net to cover the isolated incidents,78
NA,where workers lose their entitlements.,78
NA,I do not apologise at all for telling people,78
NA,not to compromise on the Manusafe issue,78
NA,and I will never apologise for opposing,78
NA,strikes against the national interest. This,78
NA,government did everything it could to stop,78
NA,"this strike, even indicating repeatedly that we",78
NA,would seek leave to intervene before the,78
NA,commission in support of a return to work,78
NA,order. We constantly wanted to stop this,78
NA,"strike-unlike members opposite, who con-",78
NA,"stantly supported this strike, constantly sup-",78
NA,ported the AMWU and constantly support,78
NA,Manusafe.,78
NA,We saw from the Leader of the Opposition,78
NA,this afternoon a non-stop tirade of personal,78
NA,abuse that would have been worthy of his,78
NA,"former boss, Paul Keating. It was a constant",78
NA,litany of contemptuous abuse which demeans,78
NA,him and demeans his office and is unworthy,78
NA,of this parliament. I do not know what I have,78
NA,"done to get under his skin, but I have cer-",78
NA,tainly done something or this government,78
NA,has done something. I think what is getting,78
NA,under his skin is the knowledge that this,78
NA,election is slipping away from him-the,78
NA,knowledge that what he thought was in the,78
NA,bag is now slipping away from him.,78
NA,I concede that I am far from perfect as an,78
NA,individual and that I have made many mis-,78
NA,"takes. Over the years, I have even made, I",78
NA,"am sure, some mistakes as a minister. But I",78
NA,would certainly defend my record as a hu-,78
NA,man being and a minister against that of the,78
NA,Leader of the Opposition. Let us not forget,78
NA,that he was the defence minister responsible,78
NA,for the Collins class subs; the communica-,78
NA,or tions minister responsible for the Optus-,78
NA,Telstra $4 billion cable duplication; the em-,78
NA,proployment minister when unemployment hit,78
NA,11 per cent-a post war record; and the fi-,78
NA,nance minister who ran up $30 billion worth,78
NA,of government debt in just two years. The,78
NA,Leader of the Opposition was the worst de-,78
NA,"fence minister ever, the worst communica-",78
NA,"tions minister ever, the worst employment",78
NA,minister ever and the worst finance minister,78
NA,ever-and now he wants to be Prime Minis-,78
NA,ter. But the Australian public are waking up,78
NA,to him. They know that he is all sound and,78
NA,fury. They know that he is all wind. They,78
NA,"know he is a sanctimonious windbag, and",78
NA,they are not going to vote for him.,78
NA,I will also defend the record of the Prime,78
NA,Minister against the record of the Leader of,78
NA,the Opposition. This has been a great gov-,78
NA,"ernment, led by an outstanding Prime Min-",78
NA,ister. This is the government which banned,78
NA,semiautomatic weapons after 13 years of,78
NA,inaction from members opposite. This is the,78
NA,government which secured the liberation of,78
NA,East Timor after 13 years of betrayal from,78
NA,members opposite. This is the government,78
NA,which has had the guts to put in place tax,78
NA,reform after members opposite squibbed,78
NA,from the challenge. This is the government,78
NA,which has reformed the workplace relations,78
NA,system and has given workers a fair go. This,78
NA,is the government that brought in Work for,78
NA,"the Dole, which gives Australians in need a",78
NA,chance to show what they can do.,78
NA,I am sure that many members opposite,78
NA,and on my own side of the House know more,78
NA,about industrial relations in a technical sense,78
NA,"than I do. I am sure that, as a former union",78
NA,"official, the member for Brisbane knows",78
NA,more in a technical sense about some aspects,78
NA,"of workplace relations. But I believe that I,",78
NA,"as minister, have a better set of principles. I",78
NA,believe that this government has a better set,78
NA,of principles. We support workers; members,78
NA,opposite support unions. We support free-,78
NA,dom; members opposite support union con-,78
NA,trol. We support higher pay for the ordinary,78
NA,"workers of this country; members opposite,",78
NA,"in 13 years of government, proved that they",78
NA,support reducing wages for the ordinary,78
NA,workers of this country. We believe in the,78
NA,"Australian people, and we want to focus on",78
NA,"what they can do. Deep down, members op-",79
NA,posite mistrust and even despise the Austra-,79
NA,lian people and constantly focus on what,79
NA,they cannot do.,79
NA,We have supported the Australian com-,79
NA,munity in the five years that we have been in,79
NA,government. We have delivered for the Aus-,79
NA,tralian community. We have cut unemploy-,79
NA,"ment, boosted wages, boosted growth and",79
NA,raised productivity. The Leader of the Oppo-,79
NA,sition cried crocodile tears over the plight of,79
NA,mature age workers. Mature age unemploy-,79
NA,ment was eight per cent when he left office;,79
NA,it is four per cent now. It has been well said,79
NA,by a better Labor member than most now,79
NA,"opposite, by Kim Beazley Sr, that he joined",79
NA,the Labor Party when it was full of the cream,79
NA,of the working class and left it when it was,79
NA,full of the dregs of the middle class. What,79
NA,we have seen today from the Labor Party is a,79
NA,middle-class dreg in full flight. I move:,79
NA,That all words after ‘that' be omitted with,79
NA,view to substituting the following words:,79
NA,‘The House censures the Leader of the Oppo-,79
NA,sition for his failure to condemn irresponsible,79
NA,strike action in the manufacturing industry and,79
NA,for his continuing policy failure to promote the,79
NA,national interest over the union interest.',79
NA,I commend the amendment to the House.,79
Mr BEVIS ,Brisbane) (4.02 p.m.)-The,79
NA,last few weeks have demonstrated conclu-,79
NA,sively to the Australian people a few things,79
NA,about this minister and this government.,79
NA,They remember his comments a month ago,79
NA,"on Four Corners, when he told the world",79
NA,that people who are in poverty are there by,79
NA,choice. He said:,79
NA,But we can't abolish poverty because poverty in,79
NA,part is a function of individual behaviour.,79
NA,His view expressed to the Australian people,79
NA,"was: when you find yourself in poverty, re-",79
NA,member that you made the choices. He then,79
NA,went on and enumerated some of them. The,79
NA,Australian people found that out in the last,79
NA,month. But there is another thing they found,79
NA,"out in the last week. As workers in this land,",79
NA,they want to have their rights protected.,79
NA,They want to know that their entitlements are,79
NA,going to be there if the company goes belly-,79
NA,up. They know that they now have two,79
NA,choices: they can have Stan Howard running,79
NA,"the company, or they can have Kim Beazley",79
NA,as Prime Minister. Australian workers now,79
NA,know that that is the only way their wages,79
NA,are going to be secure if the company be-,79
NA,"comes insolvent. To date, the only people in",79
NA,Australia who have had their entitlements,79
NA,fully protected are the workers at National,79
NA,Textiles-the special Stan-alone top-up; the,79
NA,one-off payment to Stan Howard. The gov-,79
NA,ernment have dodged questions about that all,79
NA,week.,79
NA,Unlike the minister at the table and the,79
NA,"former minister, on a number of occasions I",79
NA,went to National Textiles and visited the,79
NA,workers and spoke to them and their fami-,79
NA,"lies. They were not statistics, they were peo-",79
NA,ple. Many of them had worked in that indus-,79
NA,try and for that company all their lives. Their,79
NA,total life savings were their accrued long-,79
NA,"service leave, annual leave and redundancy",79
NA,pay and the very modest house that they,79
NA,lived in. Those were their total life savings.,79
NA,a If they had been able to get only the payment,79
NA,"of this government's employee scheme,",79
NA,those workers would have got well under,79
NA,one-third of the entitlement that was due to,79
NA,them. Their life savings were evaporating in,79
NA,front of their eyes.,79
NA,Another thing that the past couple of,79
NA,weeks have demonstrated to us all is that the,79
NA,minister has a lot of trouble telling the truth.,79
NA,He has a lot of trouble telling the truth in this,79
NA,"chamber, and he seems to have greater diffi-",79
NA,culty with it outside the chamber. Let me,79
NA,remind people of one of the comments he,79
NA,made a little while ago here in the chamber,79
NA,at question time when dealing with Austra-,79
NA,lian workplace agreements. The minister was,79
NA,at pains to tell the parliament that if you are,79
NA,"on an AWA, you are actually better off. ‘You",79
NA,"get more money on an AWA,' he said. Of",79
NA,"course, in the next question he immediately",79
NA,"found out the truth of the matter, which was",79
NA,that the average Australian worker on an,79
NA,AWA today earns $55.10 a week less than,79
NA,they would if they were on a union agree-,79
NA,ment. If the minister cannot tell the truth here,79
NA,"at question time, in answer to a dorothy dix",79
NA,"question that was prepared in his office, what",79
NA,hope is there that he is able to adhere to the,79
NA,facts or to tell the truth when issues like,79
NA,Tristar come along?,79
NA,Not telling the truth would have been bad,80
NA,"enough, but the minister set out to fuel the",80
NA,"fire. At every opportunity over the last week,",80
NA,this minister has simply opened his mouth to,80
NA,change feet-from one disaster to the next.,80
NA,He attacked those workers as being guilty of,80
NA,treason. The headline in the Australian was,80
NA,‘Car strike treason to spread'. The minister,80
NA,alleges that those people are guilty of trea-,80
NA,son-for what? It is because they were on,80
NA,strike. They were stopping the operations of,80
NA,"that company and, the minister would say,",80
NA,causing problems in other parts of the car,80
NA,"industry. He knows, even with his limited",80
NA,"knowledge of industrial relations, that those",80
NA,workers were taking totally lawful action in,80
NA,accordance with his legislation. More than,80
NA,"that, they were taking action not only in ac-",80
NA,cordance with his industry legislation but,80
NA,also in accordance with what he said they,80
NA,should do to protect their entitlements.,80
NA,The minister might remember this docu-,80
NA,"ment, Protection of employee entitlements on",80
NA,employer insolvency. It is subtitled ‘A rebut-,80
NA,tal of Labor's supposed alternatives'. It took,80
NA,"them 18 months, with the whole government",80
NA,"bureaucracy behind them, to produce a cri-",80
NA,"tique of our policy, which the minister knows",80
NA,is not Manusafe. He knows that to be the,80
NA,"case, and throughout question time today he",80
NA,made comments to the contrary. In the,80
NA,"document that he released, knowing that",80
NA,their scheme is flawed and to try and cover,80
NA,"himself, he said:",80
NA,The government scheme is a safety net scheme,80
NA,and does not preclude the adoption of additional,80
NA,measures by particular employees and employers.,80
NA,That is precisely what those workers did.,80
NA,They took this government's advice: ‘If you,80
NA,want to protect your entitlements above our,80
NA,"shoddy little basement scheme, this so-called",80
NA,"safety net, you've got to go out there and",80
NA,negotiate it company by company.' And do,80
NA,you know what? You cannot get it arbitrated.,80
NA,Under this government's industrial relations,80
NA,"laws, the Industrial Relations Commission",80
NA,cannot make a decision. Here is the rub: the,80
NA,government give you a second rate scheme,80
NA,"which, for most people, gives them a small",80
NA,percentage of what was all theirs to begin,80
NA,with. That is what they give you for your,80
NA,"entitlements, and then they say, ‘But if you",80
NA,"want more, go and negotiate it.' But then",80
NA,they put in place an industrial relations sys-,80
NA,tem that does not allow the umpire to give it,80
NA,to you. The only way you can get it is to ex-,80
NA,ercise your rights to collective action. That is,80
NA,"exactly what the workers at Tristar did, in",80
NA,accordance with the law that this government,80
NA,put down. For their trouble in taking this,80
NA,"minister's advice earlier this year, following",80
NA,the legislation that the government had put,80
NA,"down, they were charged with treason and",80
NA,told they were traitors.,80
NA,The minister might like to make a journey,80
NA,up to Tristar next week and have a talk with,80
NA,the workers. I will tell him what sort of re-,80
NA,ception he will get. I know what they said,80
NA,about him when they met last weekend. He,80
NA,thought he was going to fix the problem by,80
NA,threatening them. The response of the work-,80
NA,ers at their meeting on the weekend was an-,80
NA,ger towards this minister. His behaviour to-,80
NA,wards them was as inflammatory in the dis-,80
NA,pute as the issue that caused it in the first,80
NA,place-and his failure to apologise to them is,80
NA,a disgrace.,80
NA,I suggest that the minister test my veracity,80
NA,on this to see whether I am telling the truth.,80
NA,"Go up there next week, Minister. Go up there",80
NA,and confront those workers at Tristar. I will,80
NA,come with you. You and I together can go,80
NA,and talk to the workers up there. I am sure,80
NA,that management will not object. I am sure,80
NA,Dougie Cameron will not object. The minis-,80
NA,ter and I can go up to Tristar next week and,80
NA,let us see what the workers say to this min-,80
NA,ister about the way he has conducted him-,80
NA,self.,80
NA,"In fact, let us see what management says",80
NA,about the way he conducted himself. Not,80
NA,content with inflaming the situation by tell-,80
NA,ing these people that they are guilty of trea-,80
NA,"son, he then turned around and said to the",80
NA,"company, ‘Don't negotiate. Don't compro-",80
NA,"mise.' Now, there is a novel approach for a",80
NA,minister trying to solve a dispute-‘Don't,80
NA,negotiate.' I cannot think of a precedent of a,80
NA,"minister, supposedly acting as the honest",80
NA,"broker in a dispute, telling one side of the",80
NA,"argument, ‘Look, don't talk to them. Don't",80
NA,"compromise.' He then tells the other side,",80
NA,‘The only way this is going to be solved is if,80
NA,you back down and give up on what you,81
NA,want.',81
NA,If the company had taken the minister's,81
NA,"advice, we would still have the dispute today",81
NA,and the workers would still have no protec-,81
NA,tion. That is what the situation would be to-,81
NA,day. I suggest that next week the minister,81
NA,and I find time in our diaries and make that,81
NA,"trip. It will be an education for you, and you",81
NA,"need it, because you rightly referred to the",81
NA,fact a minute ago that there are many people,81
NA,in this parliament who know more about in-,81
NA,dustrial relations than you do. And there are.,81
Dr MARTIN ,Everyone.,81
Mr BEVIS,My colleague the member,81
NA,for Cunningham is correct; probably every-,81
NA,one in this parliament knows more about,81
NA,industrial relations than does the minister.,81
NA,"However, the minister's approach to the job",81
NA,is novel. It is a novel approach to the job to,81
NA,commence your presentations to audiences,81
NA,of business executives by telling them that,81
NA,they all know more about the subject than,81
NA,you do. Your message has got through. They,81
NA,actually understand that. If they did not un-,81
NA,"derstand it before this week, they sure do",81
NA,"now. However, I think that the message got",81
NA,"through before this week. In the recess, I",81
NA,visited a great many business functions and,81
NA,"organisations, at which business executives",81
NA,"were in attendance, to talk about industrial",81
NA,"relations. At one of those gatherings, which I",81
NA,am happy to say was sold out two weeks,81
NA,"before the event occurred, they were at pains",81
NA,to point out to me that many more people,81
NA,had come along to listen to me than came to,81
NA,listen to you at a similar function. That might,81
NA,have something to do with the fact that you,81
NA,stand up in front of them and tell them that,81
NA,you haven't got a clue what you are talking,81
NA,about. I was a little surprised at one of the,81
NA,gatherings when one of the senior executives,81
NA,"said, ‘You know, I was at a thing about two",81
NA,or three weeks ago and he still started out by,81
NA,"saying, “Everyone in this room knows more",81
NA,"about industrial relations than me,” to which",81
NA,"people shook their heads and asked, “Why is",81
NA,"he in the job?”' Minister, that is a question",81
NA,"all workers in Australia are entitled to ask,",81
NA,and the answer is that you should not be in,81
NA,the job.,81
NA,This is not just a critique from the Labor,81
NA,Party or the trade unions about your behav-,81
NA,iour. Let us have a look at the behaviour of,81
NA,the minister as reported in an editorial in the,81
NA,Age earlier this week which was headed,81
NA,‘Tony Abbott and his entitlements'. It said:,81
NA,Mr Abbott seems to believe that all industrial,81
NA,"action is wrong, even though his laws allow it,",81
NA,and that no union is capable of acting decently.,81
NA,He appears to see his role as being the nation's,81
NA,chief union basher.,81
NA,That editorial of the Melbourne Age got you,81
NA,in one. The editorial went on to talk about,81
NA,the issue in dispute and said:,81
NA,"The government's proposed scheme, which caps",81
NA,"payouts at $20,000 and hands the bill to the tax-",81
NA,"payers, seems inadequate and the Labor states are",81
NA,probably right not to sign up to it.,81
NA,Dead right. They had made the correct deci-,81
NA,sion on that. The Financial Review also,81
NA,found it amusing that you should rail the way,81
NA,you have at workers doing no more than,81
NA,following your laws and your plan for how,81
NA,they should secure their entitlements. It said:,81
NA,"Tony Abbott, the self-confessed new boy of",81
NA,"workplace relations, may call it a crime against",81
NA,the national interest or industrial and economic,81
NA,"treason, but the strike which has shut down Aus-",81
NA,tralia's car making industry is entirely consistent,81
NA,with the law and logic of our enterprise bargain-,81
NA,ing system.,81
NA,"If the journalists understood that law, it is a",81
NA,fair request that the minister should under-,81
NA,"stand it as well, but you have exhibited no",81
NA,evidence that you understand any of it.,81
NA,Let us turn to the issue of the protection of,81
NA,"those workers' entitlements. As I said, you",81
NA,put out a report on the various options. I as-,81
NA,sume you read your report. So you know that,81
NA,your claims in question time today were to-,81
NA,tally false. The report talks about Labor's,81
NA,scheme and I felt like we had been flogged,81
NA,with the proverbial wet lettuce after I had,81
NA,"read it. After 18 months, you have not been",81
NA,able to find any hole in the scheme.,81
NA,I was heartened in that context to see what,81
NA,the Australian newspaper said in the middle,81
NA,of this dispute in their editorial on 4 August,81
NA,2001. Having described the problems in the,81
NA,"industry, the government's half-baked",81
NA,scheme and the claim by the union for,81
NA,"Manusafe, they said:",81
NA,"Against this background, Labor's proposal to",82
NA,levy a 0.1 per cent surcharge,82
NA,perannuation Guarantee system looks more and,82
NA,"more attractive. At a minimal cost to employers,",82
NA,it would create a scheme that is simple and can,82
NA,use existing administrative infrastructure. It,82
NA,would offer most workers comprehensive protec-,82
NA,tion that existing schemes lack.,82
NA,The editorial writer in the Australian under-,82
NA,stands where the protection is for ordinary,82
NA,Australian workers. As you cannot under-,82
NA,"stand the legislation, Minister, you might at",82
NA,least try reading some of the newspapers;,82
NA,you could pick up a few clues.,82
NA,The government have urged on these,82
NA,workers a system that is divisive and disrup-,82
NA,tive. That is your system. You have urged on,82
NA,the company a practice where they should,82
NA,"not negotiate, even though under your sys-",82
NA,tem we supposedly have a negotiations,82
NA,framework. What has been the result of that?,82
NA,"As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out,",82
NA,"the company, under pressure from this gov-",82
NA,"ernment, decided they would not sign up to",82
NA,"Manusafe. Had they signed up to Manusafe,",82
NA,"they would have had to pay out $174,000.",82
NA,That is the manufacturing workers scheme; it,82
NA,"is not our scheme. It is a trust fund model,",82
NA,"which is a legitimate model. Indeed, there",82
NA,are other trust funds that operate in a range,82
NA,"of industries, and there is nothing wrong",82
NA,"with that model. Instead of doing that, they",82
NA,signed up to an insurance bond. So it is not a,82
NA,trust; it is simply an insurance bond. At least,82
NA,"in the trust fund model, the money is there to",82
NA,"come back out, but this is an insurance bond.",82
NA,"Instead of paying $174,000 a year, they are",82
NA,"going to pay $700,000 a year. Of course, if",82
NA,"we were in government, they would have a",82
NA,"national scheme, and they would pay",82
NA,"$11,600.",82
NA,I think this is no contest. I say to the,82
NA,"ister and to those opposite that, as the weeks",82
NA,and months unfold and as employers under-,82
NA,stand that your system requires this to be,82
NA,replicated not just in the manufacturing sec-,82
NA,"tor but in every company in the land, they",82
NA,will very quickly come to understand what,82
NA,the editorial in the Australian said. The fu-,82
NA,ture for Australian workers to have their en-,82
NA,titlements protected is with a Beazley led,82
NA,"government, which will legislate to fix this",82
NA,"mess, and it will do it early in the next term.",82
NA,on the existing Su- (Time expired),82
Mr CHARLES ,La Trobe) (4.17 p.m.)-I,82
NA,rise to defend the integrity of this minister.,82
NA,This is a good minister in a good government,82
NA,that has been good for Australia. The mem-,82
NA,"ber for Brisbane said, ‘If we had been in",82
NA,"government'-well, if you had been in gov-",82
NA,"ernment, heaven help us. The minister has",82
NA,proposed that we not censure the Minister for,82
NA,"Employment, Workplace Relations and",82
NA,Small Business-because he does not de-,82
NA,serve censure-but instead censure the oppo-,82
NA,sition.,82
NA,"During his very emotive diatribe, the pro-",82
NA,lix Leader of the Opposition said of the,82
NA,"minister, ‘This is not how Australia is sup-",82
NA,posed to be governed'. We are governing,82
NA,"Australia fearlessly, free of outside influence,",82
NA,"free of domination by outside organisations,",82
NA,free of financial influence by financial sup-,82
NA,porters of our two great political parties-,82
NA,free of all that. But what would we have if,82
NA,Jennie George was successful? Who would,82
NA,we have sitting on the Treasury benches on,82
NA,"this side of the House if, at the next election,",82
NA,the prolix Leader of the Opposition managed,82
NA,to be successful? We would have three for-,82
NA,mer ACTU presidents sitting on the front,82
NA,"bench, occupying the Treasury benches,",82
NA,dominating cabinet and using trade union,82
NA,funds to determine the policy position and,82
NA,parameters of any Beazley led Labor gov-,82
NA,ernment. That does not sound to me like the,82
NA,"way that I want Australia governed, Mr",82
NA,"Deputy Speaker, and I suspect that you",82
NA,"would not want it governed that way either,",82
NA,and I know that the Australian people do not.,82
NA,I will tell you about this censure motion. It,82
NA,"is a lot of hot air, hype and hyperbole. We",82
NA,minhave fire and brimstone leading really to no,82
NA,outcome. All this contrived pity and concern,82
NA,for so-called ordinary Australians is nothing,82
NA,but a contrivance. Labor had 13 years to,82
NA,bring in a scheme to protect employee enti-,82
NA,tlements. This is an important national issue;,82
NA,I accept that and I have participated in this,82
NA,debate over a number of years in this place,82
NA,and outside it.,82
NA,We have essentially a range of options to,82
NA,deal with the problem of a company that,82
NA,"goes bankrupt, becomes insolvent, ceases to",82
NA,trade and has not the funds in the bank to pay,83
NA,nor the assets to support paying workers their,83
NA,"legal entitlements, including pay, holiday",83
NA,"pay, accrued long service leave and redun-",83
NA,dancy funds agreed to in their workplace,83
NA,"agreement-that is, whatever built-up enti-",83
NA,tlements there are. If the company goes,83
NA,"broke and cannot pay those, it is right and",83
NA,proper that that money should be paid to,83
NA,those individuals. One of the problems is this,83
NA,question: ‘Why don't you amend the com-,83
NA,pany law and put employees first in front of,83
NA,secured creditors?' Even the Labor Party,83
NA,have not proposed that. In their 13 years of,83
NA,"benign neglect on this issue, they certainly",83
NA,never proposed that. The reason they did not,83
NA,was that we would have a great deal of diffi-,83
NA,culty in attracting investment in viable in-,83
NA,"dustry and commerce to this country, and we",83
NA,would not have the jobs that we need to sup-,83
NA,port Australians and the jobs that Australians,83
NA,want to support themselves.,83
NA,Putting employee entitlements at the top,83
NA,of the list just is not viable. We have a few,83
NA,other options. We could ask the taxpayers to,83
NA,pick up the bill on behalf of their fellow,83
NA,zens for the very few who actually lose their,83
NA,"jobs when companies dissolve, become in-",83
NA,"solvent, cease trading and do not have the",83
NA,funds to pay out what they legally owe to the,83
NA,"employees, and where the liquidator or ad-",83
NA,ministrator is unable to recover funds from,83
NA,the personal accounts of the directors of the,83
NA,companies to help cover what the employees,83
NA,are owed. So we can say that the public,83
NA,purse is the right and proper place for that to,83
NA,occur and that such payment would have the,83
NA,least total effect on Australian society as a,83
NA,whole and particularly on Australian busi-,83
NA,"ness, which we need to sustain employment",83
NA,"and our great lifestyle. That is, in fact, what",83
NA,the government scheme is all about.,83
NA,"Unfortunately, except for South Australia",83
NA,"and for the Northern Territory, the states",83
NA,have not come on board for this scheme. So,83
NA,employees of those companies which have,83
NA,"gone under, and where there have not been",83
NA,"sufficient funds to pay out what they owed,",83
NA,will receive a payment from the Common-,83
NA,wealth government. But do they see also a,83
NA,corresponding payment from the state Labor,83
NA,governments which are ideologically driven,83
NA,to support the Leader of the Opposition? The,83
NA,"answer is no, they do not. The states have not",83
NA,"come on board the scheme, and that makes it",83
NA,less than desirable. So if a company goes,83
NA,"belly up in South Australia, those workers",83
NA,can be assured that they are going to be,83
NA,much better taken care of than their compa-,83
NA,triots in the states of Victoria and New South,83
NA,"Wales or, for that matter, Queensland and",83
NA,Western Australia.,83
NA,I asked the minister in question time today,83
NA,whether there are other proposals around.,83
NA,There are. One proposal is to have a national,83
NA,insurance scheme for all industry. Every vi-,83
NA,"able company, those that are doing the right",83
NA,"thing, trading profitably, paying their taxes,",83
NA,"paying their employees, have good safety",83
NA,programs and are contributing to the Austra-,83
NA,lian economy and the welfare and benefit of,83
NA,"all of us, would have to kick in for the few",83
NA,rotten eggs in the barrel. I do not believe that,83
NA,that is the best way to approach the issue.,83
NA,But it would be one heck of a lot less expen-,83
NA,"sive than this Manusafe scheme, that is for",83
NA,sure. I am advised that were we to put one-,83
NA,cititenth of one per cent into a national insur-,83
NA,ance scheme of all companies-which I,83
NA,think is what the Australian Labor Party are,83
NA,"proposing, but I am not real clear because I",83
NA,have not been able to read their policy any-,83
NA,where-that would cost industry some $250,83
NA,"million a year. I am also advised, however,",83
NA,that if this Manusafe scheme promoted by,83
NA,the AMWU were imposed in the manufac-,83
NA,"turing industry alone, that would cost those",83
NA,companies $550 million a year.,83
NA,"Mr Danby-What about the $700,000 in-",83
NA,surance bond?,83
Mr CHARLES,How much employment,83
NA,do you get for 550 million bucks? You get a,83
NA,"lot, don't you? I am also advised that if the",83
NA,"government scheme were fully implemented,",83
NA,if the states joined the scheme and everybody,83
NA,"came on board, we took care of all those",83
NA,companies that went under and there was no,83
NA,sudden national catastrophe like a flood or,83
NA,"drought, the cost would be in the order of",83
NA,$50 million. So we are talking peanuts to,83
NA,megabucks. Guess who wants to spend the,83
NA,megabucks? The Labor Party and the trade,83
NA,union movement to whom the Labor Party is,83
NA,beholden.,83
NA,Mr Danby-What about the firm that had,84
NA,to pay megabucks this week? Tell us about,84
NA,the insurance bond they had to pay?,84
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Nehl)-,84
NA,The member for Melbourne Ports!,84
Mr CHARLES,The individual compa-,84
NA,nies do have another option. They could cre-,84
NA,"ate trust funds, couldn't they? Each of them",84
NA,could create an individual trust fund for its,84
NA,members. I tell you that if you take that,84
NA,"much money out of the economy, put it into",84
NA,"trusts and lock it up, so you cannot invest it",84
NA,and you cannot use it for productive pur-,84
NA,"poses, you will make Australian industry less",84
NA,competitive than it should be. I point out to,84
NA,those opposite that the last two reports on,84
NA,trade balances have been absolutely out-,84
NA,standing: two quarters in a row where we,84
NA,sold more to the rest of the world than we,84
NA,bought from the rest of the world. We have,84
NA,not quite made it with the current account,84
NA,deficit yet because we still have not paid,84
NA,back all the money that the Hawke and,84
NA,Keating governments borrowed over 13,84
NA,"years, but we have made a $60 million dent",84
NA,"in it. When we get that wound down, if we",84
NA,can keep going the way we are going in,84
NA,"terms of our trade balance, we will have",84
NA,solved the balance of payments problem.,84
NA,That is positive. But if we accept,84
NA,"union scheme called Manusafe, to take 1.5",84
NA,per cent of the wages bill of every company,84
NA,in this country and lock it up in an unpro-,84
NA,"ductive fund, we are asking for those com-",84
NA,"panies to be less productive, to employ fewer",84
NA,"people, to pay less in the way of taxes to the",84
NA,federal government-,84
NA,Mr Danby-What happened to Tristar?,84
Mr SPEAKER,The member for Mel-,84
NA,bourne Ports is warned.,84
Mr CHARLES,That mob over there is,84
NA,the high taxing lot-high taxing and high,84
NA,spending. That is what Labor governments,84
NA,always do-rake the money in and spend it,84
NA,as fast you can. But I tell you that you cannot,84
NA,rake it in if you cannot collect the taxes be-,84
NA,cause the companies are not profitable. Since,84
NA,"1996, when the coalition came to govern-",84
NA,"ment, we have had a remarkable turnaround",84
NA,in improvement in real wages for working,84
NA,Australians. I am proud of that. We do not,84
NA,"have any accord with the ACTU, no accord",84
NA,with the trade union movement. What we,84
NA,have got instead is individuals out there im-,84
NA,proving their companies' productivity and,84
NA,the companies rewarding them with better,84
NA,"wages, better conditions and a better living,",84
NA,and everybody is happy.,84
NA,I will tell my friends on this side of the,84
NA,House something: when you get to the elec-,84
NA,"tion campaign, tell your constituents what",84
NA,"has happened to their standard of living, to",84
NA,"their real wages, to their comfort zone, to",84
NA,their interest rates and to a well run economy,84
NA,"since 1996, and then ask them if they really",84
NA,want to trust that mob over there who want,84
NA,to get stuck into their pockets again. That is,84
NA,what this debate is all about. This debate is,84
NA,"an attempt to censure a good minister, but it",84
NA,"is nothing but a phoney debate, because what",84
NA,they are on about is trying to sneak their way,84
NA,into government so the ACTU can come,84
NA,back and try to run the country again. If that,84
NA,"happened, we would have secret deals with",84
NA,"the ACTU, and we would have three former",84
NA,presidents of the ACTU sitting right here on,84
NA,"the government front benches. Really, can",84
NA,"you imagine one of them, Simon Crean, run-",84
NA,ning Treasury? I cannot for the life of me,84
NA,imagine that that would be a scenario that,84
NA,this idiotic Australians could embrace.,84
NA,This is a debate we did not really need to,84
NA,have today. We should be talking about the,84
NA,"economy. If I remember rightly, the opposi-",84
NA,tion were going to propose the following,84
NA,matter of public importance today:,84
NA,The failure-,84
NA,or the so-called failure-,84
NA,of the Government to adequately protect the liv-,84
NA,ing standards and economic security of Australian,84
NA,families.,84
NA,No wonder the opposition tried to get out of,84
NA,that. They would have looked pretty silly,84
NA,"trying to debate that issue, wouldn't they? I",84
NA,can just imagine that debate going out over,84
NA,the airwaves and all those hundreds of thou-,84
NA,sands of Australians listening on PNN to it. I,84
NA,can just imagine them trying to figure what,84
NA,‘Prolix' was on about with his statements,84
NA,"that we had a ‘poor economy, poor living",84
NA,"standards and terrible interest rates'. Oh, my",84
NA,"goodness, we should wring our hands,",84
NA,shouldn't we!,84
NA,"The Minister for Employment, Workplace",85
NA,Relations and Small Business is a good min-,85
NA,ister. He follows a good minister before him,85
NA,in the portfolio. This is a good government.,85
NA,"It governs for all Australians, not just the",85
NA,select and privileged few who happen to pay,85
NA,big money into the coffers of the ALP-,85
NA,money which happens to largely come out of,85
NA,union dues by the overencouragement of,85
NA,people to join trade unions. Even though we,85
NA,"are supposed to have got past the ‘no ticket,",85
NA,"no start' situation, we have not quite got",85
NA,"there yet. One of these days, perhaps we will.",85
NA,"I will be delighted when that day comes, and",85
NA,I will be delighted when the Leader of the,85
NA,Opposition has the guts and the intestinal,85
NA,fortitude to divorce his political party from a,85
NA,labour movement that is doing no good for,85
NA,Australia. I congratulate the minister on the,85
NA,"excellent job that he is doing, and I support",85

Mr BEAZLEY,Yes.,86

NA,"time, the Treasurer indicated that I had an",86
NA,intention to impose a levy in order to support,86

NA,"marks, the Minister for Community Services",86
NA,"quoted from a transcript, allegedly of mine,",86
NA,saying that I was ‘bound for the Lodge'. I,86

NA,used it as a direct quote. That was an answer,86

Ms KERNOT,I wish to complete the,87
NA,incomplete quotation that the minister for,87

Mr SPEAKER,No. The member for,87
NA,Dickson must indicate where she was mis-,87
NA,represented in order for me to understand,87
NA,whether she has a matter of misrepresenta-,87

Ms KERNOT,I have two matters. One,87
NA,is on what I said on the Meet the Press pro-,87

NA,seeking to indicate to her that she must indi-,87

Ms KERNOT,"I am trying to do that, Mr",87
NA,Speaker. Obviously I misunderstand you.,87

Mr SPEAKER,Does the honourable,87
NA,member claim to have been misrepresented?,87
Ms KERNOT,Yes.,87
Mr SPEAKER,Please proceed.,87
Ms KERNOT,"I have two matters, the",87
NA,first one being the minister's assertion that I,87
NA,supported the Manusafe scheme. I quote,87
NA,from my words:,87
NA,"No, we don't, because it is only for one industry.",87
NA,"We are still pushing for our national scheme, and",87
NA,that is a 0.1 per cent levy added to the superannu-,87
NA,ation guarantee charge.,87
NA,"On the second point, the minister's asser-",87
NA,"tion that I supported an illegal strike, I wish",87

Mr ZAHRA,"Yes, on two separate occa-",88
NA,sions.,88
Mr SPEAKER,Please proceed.,88
Mr ZAHRA,On 27 June in this place,88
NA,the Minister for Forestry and Conservation,88
NA,accused me of not knowing anything in rela-,88
NA,tion to the FISAP program and of not pro-,88
NA,viding any assistance to my constituents in,88
NA,relation to that program. He said:,88
NA,Members from Victoria are currently given appliresume,88
NA,cants information and asking them if they can,88
NA,offer assistance-,88
Mr SPEAKER,The member for,88
NA,MCMillan will resume his seat. I call the,88
NA,Leader of the House.,88
NA,"Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, my understand-",88
NA,ing is that where a person wishes to seek,88
NA,leave under this process they must do so in a,88
NA,"reasonably timely and expeditious way, and",88
NA,27 June is going back a while and we were,88
NA,sitting after that.,88
Mr SPEAKER,Given that the House in,88
NA,"fact did not sit in July, I would not have",88
NA,thought that the member for MCMillan's re-,88
NA,"quest was unreasonable. I would, however,",88
NA,require the member for MCMillan to come,88
NA,instantly to the point where he was misrepre-,88
NA,sented.,88
Mr ZAHRA,He went on to say:,88
NA,"His problem is that he did not know, and, worse, answer.",88
NA,he did not care.,88
NA,On 9 September 1999 I organised a briefing,88
NA,in my office on the Victorian Forest Industry,88
NA,"Structural Adjustment Program, which was",88
NA,circulated to all timber mills and forest in-,88
NA,"dustries in my electorate, thus proving the",88
NA,claim to be incorrect.,88
Mr SPEAKER,The member for,88
NA,MCMillan need prove nothing. He has indi-,88
NA,cated where he was misrepresented. He will,88
NA,come to the next item.,88
Mr ZAHRA,I have a second instance,88
NA,where I have been misrepresented. In ques-,88
NA,tion time today the Minister for Forestry and,88
NA,Conservation suggested that I had received,88
NA,money from the union which covers workers,88
NA,at the Maryvale plant of PaperlinX. The,88
NA,main union which covers workers in that,88
NA,plant is the Pulp and Paper Workers Union,88
NA,Branch of the Forestry Division of the,88
NA,CFMEU. I have never received one single,88
NA,"cent from this union, and the implication that",88
NA,the money from that-,88
Mr SPEAKER,The member for,88
NA,MCMillan will resume his seat.,88
Mr ZAHRA,union has been used to,88
NA,buy-,88
Mr SPEAKER,The member for,88
NA,MCMillan is now insulting the chair and will,88
NA,his seat or I will deal with him. I en-,88
NA,deavour to be helpful to the member for,88
NA,MCMillan. I do not expect the response to be,88
NA,abuse of the standing orders.,88

NA,Questions on Notice,88

NA,question No. 2622 to the Attorney-General,88

NA,the-,88
Mr SPEAKER,The member for Lowe,88
NA,does not need to indicate what the question,88
NA,relates to-merely the number and the date,88
NA,on which it was submitted.,88
Mr MURPHY,On 4 June it appeared on,88
NA,the Notice Paper re Dr Mal Colston. I would,88
NA,"be very, very grateful if you would write to",88
NA,the Attorney-General and seek reasons why,88
NA,"he has not replied to that question, because",88
NA,the public interest is screaming out for an,88
Mr SPEAKER,I will follow up the,88
NA,"matter as the standing orders provide. I, too,",88
NA,"would be very, very grateful for a somewhat",88
NA,more succinct reference to standing order,88
NA,150.,88
NA,Member for MCMillan: Misrepresentation,88
Mr OKEEFE ,4.52 p.m.)-I have a,88
NA,"question of you, Mr Speaker. It arises out of",88
NA,the statement which has just been made by,88
NA,the member for MCMillan relating to the,89
NA,misrepresentation of his position during,89
NA,question time. You have witnessed the events,89
NA,that took place today-you have heard it all.,89
NA,You heard the minister not just misrepresent,89
NA,"the member for MCMillan but, in fact, tell a",89
NA,very direct lie.,89
NA,Mr Reith interjecting-,89
Mr OKEEFE ,Excuse me. I am asking,89
NA,a question-,89
Mr SPEAKER,The member for Burke,89
NA,will be required to resume his seat and not be,89
NA,heard at all unless he learns to direct his re-,89
NA,marks through the chair.,89
NA,"Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I ask that the al-",89
NA,legation be withdrawn.,89
Mr SPEAKER,The Leader of the,89
NA,House makes a reasonable request. The,89
NA,member for Burke will withdraw the impli-,89
NA,cation that a member lied to him deliberately.,89
Mr OKEEFE ," Mr Speaker, I seek your",89
NA,guidance on this. I am not attempting to defy,89
NA,"your ruling. If you insist I withdraw, I will.",89
NA,But I did not say that the minister was a liar.,89
NA,Mrs Crosio interjecting-,89
Mr SPEAKER,"Member for Prospect,",89
NA,"as an occupier of the chair, how can you pos-",89
NA,sibly not understand the fundamental courte-,89
NA,sies that the standing orders oblige all of us,89
NA,to exercise one to the other?,89
NA,"Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, my point of or-",89
NA,der is that you have asked the member to,89
NA,withdraw. Under the guise of discussing your,89
NA,"request, he simply attempts to repeat the al-",89
NA,legations he has made in a different way. I,89
NA,"ask you, as a matter of fairness, Mr Speaker,",89
NA,that he not be allowed to do so.,89
NA,"Mrs Crosio-I raise a point of order, Mr",89
NA,Speaker. Further to the point of order as,89
NA,"raised by the Leader of the House, the ques-",89
NA,tion that I uttered and was reprimanded by,89
NA,"you for, sir, was: how can the Leader of the",89
NA,House take a point of order on the member in,89
NA,this parliament who questioned what your,89
NA,direction would be?,89
NA,Mr Reith interjecting-,89
Mr SPEAKER,The Leader of the,89
NA,House is not assisting the chair. The member,89
NA,for Prospect is well aware that one of the,89
NA,"forms of the House designed, in fact, to pro-",89
NA,tect the dignity of the House and the way in,89
NA,which the chair exercises its decisions at all,89
NA,times is the facility that members have to,89
NA,"take points of order, a facility that I think is",89
NA,sometimes abused. It does not alter the obli-,89
NA,gation that I have to hear any point of order.,89
Mr OKEEFE ,As I was saying-,89
NA,Mr Reith interjecting-,89
Mr SPEAKER,I will deal with the,89
NA,member for Burke. I do not need any help,89
NA,from the Leader of the House unless he re-,89
NA,quests it from the dispatch box.,89
Mr OKEEFE ,"This situation, as you",89
NA,have heard and as the member for MCMillan,89
NA,has attempted to cover under the standing,89
NA,"orders, is what I would describe as more than",89
NA,a misrepresentation; it is a very direct state-,89
NA,"ment that was an untruth. As such, when the",89
NA,member for MCMillan has stood-,89
NA,"Mr Ronaldson- Mr Speaker, I raise a",89
NA,point of order. You have made a quite spe-,89
NA,cific request for the member for Burke to,89
NA,withdraw the comment which you found un-,89
NA,parliamentary. It is not a matter that requires,89
NA,debate; it is a matter that requires immediate,89
NA,withdrawal.,89
Mr SPEAKER,The member for Burke,89
NA,"was, in fact, directing a question to the",89
NA,"Speaker. I was endeavouring, in the interests",89
NA,"of impartiality, as do all occupiers of the",89
NA,"chair, to hear him out. He would have been",89
NA,facilitating the chair by being succinct with,89
NA,his question instead of deliberately drawing,89
NA,"it out, and there are members on my right",89
NA,who would facilitate the chair by allowing,89
NA,me to get to the point at which I can rule on,89
NA,the member for Burke's point of order.,89
NA,"Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, you said quite",89
NA,specifically that it was appropriate for him to,89
NA,"withdraw and, under the conventions of this",89
NA,"House, when people are asked to withdraw",89
NA,they do not stand and say ‘if this' and ‘if,89
NA,that'. This is simply an abuse of an opportu-,89
NA,nity provided to members-,89
NA,Mr Bevis interjecting-,89
Mr SPEAKER,The member for Bris-,89
NA,bane is warned.,89
NA,Mr Reith-to ask the Speaker questions,89
NA,relating to matters within the Speaker's ad-,89
NA,ministration. This is yet another example of a,89
NA,question designed to go over a matter which,90
NA,had arisen during question time.,90
NA,Mr Adams interjecting-,90
Mr SPEAKER,The member for Lyons,90
NA,is also warned.,90
NA,"Mr Reith-I ask you, Mr Speaker, in con-",90
NA,"formity with your request, that you confirm",90
NA,your request for him to withdraw; otherwise,90
NA,he should be asked to be seated.,90
Mr OKEEFE ,I am very happy to,90
NA,withdraw if that will assist you and will en-,90
NA,able me to complete the question I am asking,90
NA,of you. Do you want me to withdraw?,90
Mr SPEAKER,I do require the member,90
NA,for Burke to withdraw. I thought I had made,90
NA,that perfectly evident all of about 10 minutes,90
NA,ago.,90
Mr OKEEFE ,I withdraw.,90
Mr SPEAKER,The member for,90
NA,Burke's question is?,90
Mr OKEEFE ,The question that I was,90
NA,three-quarters of the way through was: in this,90
NA,situation where it was not just a misrepre-,90
NA,sentation but a very direct untruth-,90
NA,"Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of",90
NA,order. This question is totally inappropriate.,90
NA,This member is attempting to make a debat-,90
NA,ing point against a minister. That is an incorpressing,90
NA,rect form. If people want to make substantive,90
NA,"allegations, the standing orders make it clear",90
NA,how they should so proceed. I put it to you,90
NA,that this question is totally out of order and,90
NA,should not be countenanced.,90
Mr SPEAKER,The member for Burke,90
NA,"will succinctly come to his point, which is",90
NA,currently getting very drawn out.,90
Mr OKEEFE ,I am asking for guidance,90
NA,"from you, Mr Speaker, about a member who",90
NA,correctly used the standing orders provided,90
NA,"to correct a misrepresentation, as occurred,",90
NA,but was required by you to conclude at the,90
NA,point at which you felt he had corrected the,90
NA,misrepresentation. When that misrepresenta-,90
NA,"tion is very serious and is, in fact, more",90
NA,"a misrepresentation, I believe it is in order",90
NA,for the member to be given the opportunity,90
NA,to more fully explain his situation. I am ask-,90
NA,ing you: would you give consideration to,90
NA,some further scope for the member for,90
NA,MCMillan to fully complete his rebuttal of,90
NA,the untruth made about him?,90
NA,Mr Ronaldson-The cattle will be put-,90
NA,ting bacon and eggs on for breakfast if this,90
NA,keeps on going-,90
Mr SPEAKER,The Chief Government,90
NA,Whip will resume his seat. If ever there was,90
NA,"an exercise in absolute absurdity, the people",90
NA,of Australia just witnessed it.,90
NA,Mr O'Keefe interjecting-,90
Mr SPEAKER,The member for Burke,90
NA,is warned. I am on my feet. If the member,90
NA,for Burke was seriously asking me whether,90
NA,or not I am in fact prepared to intervene to,90
NA,prevent people freely expressing their view,90
NA,"in this chamber, the answer is no. I have no",90
NA,"facility, nor does any other occupier of the",90
NA,"chair have any facility, to pass judgment on",90
NA,the accuracy of what is being said. This,90
NA,chamber is built on the fundamental right of,90
NA,everybody's right to an opinion and the right,90
NA,"to be heard, and on the responsibility they of",90
NA,course have to exercise those rights in a way,90
NA,that they believe is entirely honourable.,90
NA,I have in no way thwarted the opportunity,90
NA,for the member for MCMillan to express a,90
NA,"point of view under the standing orders, nor",90
NA,will I in any way prevent a minister ex-,90
NA,a point of view under the standing,90
NA,"orders, so long as both expressions are en-",90
NA,tirely parliamentary. To do otherwise would,90
NA,be to put at risk the whole system of free,90
NA,speech and the whole system of parliamen-,90
NA,tary privilege on which this institution is,90
NA,founded. That fundamental lesson must be,90
NA,"understood by everybody in this chamber,",90
NA,almost prior to election.,90
Mr BEAZLEY ," Mr Speaker, I ask, on be-",90
NA,"half of Mr Zahra, indulgence from you. Mr",90
NA,Zahra has effectively been accused of cor-,90
NA,ruption by the minister. He said he received a,90
NA,donation and then certain things followed,90
NA,and certain behaviours were expected of him.,90
NA,It appears the donation was not made. That,90
NA,"than was a very serious allegation and I think,",90
NA,"under indulgence, he ought to be allowed to",90
NA,answer it.,90
Mr SPEAKER,I would point out-be-,90
NA,fore I recognise anybody-to the Leader of,90
NA,"the Opposition that, as he would have ex-",90
NA,"pected, the member for MCMillan was not",90
NA,only able to correct any misrepresentation,91
NA,but indicated that no donation had been re-,91
NA,ceived. The provision under the standing,91
NA,orders to correct a misrepresentation had,91
NA,been fully and appropriately discharged. I at,91
NA,no stage obliged the member for MCMillan,91
NA,to resume his seat until he entered into a,91
NA,"ond area which had, from what I could see,",91
NA,no further resemblance to whatever he was,91
NA,saying because he had made it perfectly clear,91
NA,that he had not been in receipt of any dona-,91
NA,tion. The Hansard will reinforce that point.,91
NA,Member for MCMillan: Misrepresentation,91
Mr ZAHRA ,5.03 p.m.)-I have a ques-,91
NA,"tion to you, Mr Speaker. In question time",91
NA,"today, you said, and I wrote it down, that you",91
NA,will not tolerate anybody at the dispatch box,91
NA,being deliberately deceitful. I would argue,91
NA,that in this instance the Minister for Forestry,91
NA,and Conservation has been deliberately de-,91
NA,ceitful.,91
Mr SPEAKER,The member for,91
NA,MCMillan will resume his seat. As any,91
NA,reader of the standing orders is well aware-,91
NA,and anyone who cares to peruse House of,91
NA,Representatives Practice-no-one comes,91
NA,into this House and has any opportunity to be,91
NA,deliberately deceitful. I will not enter into,91
NA,"any further negotiation, argument or discus-",91
NA,sion of this matter as referred by the member,91
NA,for MCMillan.,91
NA,"Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I ask that the",91
NA,statement made by the member for MCMillan,91
NA,be withdrawn. ‘Deliberately deceitful' is,91
NA,clearly unparliamentary and it should be,91
NA,withdrawn.,91
Mr ZAHRA," Mr Speaker, the question",91
NA,that I was going to ask-,91
Mr SPEAKER,The member for,91
NA,MCMillan will withdraw the inference.,91
Mr ZAHRA,"I withdraw, Mr Speaker.",91
NA,"Mr Speaker, I had not asked you the question",91
NA,which I wanted to ask you before you asked,91
NA,me to resume my seat. I would counter in,91
NA,this instance that the minister has made this,91
NA,implication of me-it is a substantial allega-,91
NA,tion of corruption-and he has provided no,91
NA,evidence at all in his remarks.,91
Mr SPEAKER,The member for,91
NA,MCMillan will resume his seat. The matter,91
NA,has been dealt with. The member for,91
NA,"MCMillan has, as the standing orders pro-",91
NA,"vide, had the opportunity to ensure that any",91
NA,misrepresentation has been corrected. I do,91
NA,not believe there is any need for any further,91
NA,debate on the matter.,91
NA,"Seyffer, Mr John: Parliamentary Pass",91
Mr LEO MCLEAY ,5.05 p.m.)-Earlier,91
NA,"secthis week, Mr Speaker, I asked you a ques-",91
NA,tion regarding the request for a security pass,91
NA,by Mr John Seyffer and you said you would,91
NA,come back to the House with that informa-,91
NA,tion. Are you in a position to be able to give,91
NA,us that information before the House rises,91
NA,today?,91
Mr SPEAKER,In response to the Chief,91
NA,"Opposition Whip's question, I can indicate",91
NA,that I have made inquiries and that details on,91
NA,pass application forms and pass usage are,91
NA,confidential. That is hardly surprising be-,91
NA,cause of course they are kept confidential in,91
NA,order to protect the privacy of pass holders.,91
NA,Such detail can only be released on the,91
NA,authority of the security controller and is,91
NA,only released in relation to serious security,91
NA,threats to the parliament or the occupants of,91
NA,the building. The request by the Chief Oppo-,91
NA,sition Whip for information on a pass which,91
NA,may have been issued to Mr Seyffer does not,91
NA,appear to be in relation to a serious security,91
NA,"threat and therefore such details, if they ex-",91
NA,"ist, cannot be provided.",91
Mr LEO MCLEAY," Mr Speaker, do I",91
NA,take it from your answer then that a pass has,91
NA,been issued to Mr Seyffer?,91
Mr SPEAKER,In response to the Chief,91
NA,"Opposition Whip, I have no idea whether a",91
NA,pass has or has not at any time in his occu-,91
NA,pancy of the chair or mine been issued to Mr,91
NA,Seyffer.,91
Mr LEO MCLEAY,Would you ascer-,91
NA,tain from the security controller whether a,91
NA,request for a pass for Mr Seyffer was made,91
NA,by the Minister for Sport and Tourism?,91
Mr SPEAKER,I have no intention of,91
NA,"taking the matter any further, as there is no",91
NA,threat to the building's security in this par-,91
NA,ticular instance or the security of occupants,91
NA,of the building.,91
NA,Member for MCMillan: Misrepresentation,91
Mr OKEEFE ,"5.07 p.m.)- Mr Speaker, I",91
NA,have a further question to you. While it re-,91
NA,"lates to the matter we were discussing earlier,",91
NA,"it is in a different context, and I am hastening",92
NA,to assure you of that before I ask it. Given,92
NA,what you have ruled in relation to what was,92
NA,stated and the member for MCMillan's op-,92
NA,"portunity to respond to it, my question to you",92
NA,is: what forms of the parliament are available,92
NA,for the rest of today that would enable the,92
NA,member for MCMillan to have what you,92
NA,would call a fair and equal opportunity to,92
NA,respond?,92
Mr SPEAKER,In the time that I have,92
NA,been in this parliament-in fact I am bold,92
NA,enough to suggest in the time the Leader of,92
NA,the Opposition has been in this parliament-,92
NA,the forms provided today are the same forms,92
NA,for directing misrepresentation as have been,92
NA,available for the member for MCMillan to-,92
NA,"day, and he has discharged them.",92
NA,"Seyffer, Mr John: Parliamentary Pass",92
Mr MCMULLAN ,5.08 p.m.)-I want to,92
NA,pull up on the question asked by the Chief,92
NA,"Opposition Whip, Mr Speaker. The normal",92
NA,process by which questions are asked to you,92
NA,relate to questions of administration of the,92
NA,"parliament. Classically, questions of admini-",92
NA,stration of a department go to whether this,92
NA,particular activity occurred within that de-,92
NA,"partment and, if so, who was responsible, et",92
NA,cetera. Unless it is commercial-in-confidence,92
NA,"or national security, the proper course is for",92
NA,the minister to supply an answer. On what,92
NA,grounds are you saying to the Chief Opposi-,92
NA,tion Whip that an inquiry as to whether an,92
NA,individual has received a pass and whether,92
NA,the minister for sport was the person who,92
NA,applied for that pass is not a proper matter to,92
NA,be answered to this House and not a proper,92
NA,matter about which the House is entitled to,92
NA,gain information from you? I do not under-,92
NA,stand the basis upon which you think this is,92
NA,not a proper question to which you ought,92
NA,give a reply to the House.,92
Mr SPEAKER,I have nothing to add to,92
NA,my earlier comments as recorded in Han-,92
NA,sard. The issuing of passes is a confidential,92
NA,matter. It has been for successive Speakers in,92
NA,"this place, certainly for as long as we have",92
NA,"occupied this building and, I suspect, for as",92
NA,long as we occupied the former building-as,92
NA,long as passes have been issued. While we,92
NA,have been in this building it has been a mat-,92
NA,ter that is kept in confidence. It is not the,92
NA,business of anyone who comes and goes,92
NA,from this building or signs someone in or out,92
NA,of this building unless matters of security are,92
NA,at risk. The matter referred to by the Chief,92
NA,Opposition Whip is not deemed to be a mat-,92
NA,ter of building or personal security. This is,92
NA,"consistent, I gather, with rulings made by my",92
NA,predecessors on the advice that I have from,92
NA,the security office.,92
NA,"Seyffer, Mr John: Parliamentary Pass",92
Mr LEO MCLEAY ,5.11 p.m.)- Mr,92
NA,"Speaker, is it a fact that photographic secu-",92
NA,rity passes which are issued to people in this,92
NA,"building have the name of the person, the",92
NA,person's photograph and the office that that,92
NA,person is working in on the front of the pass?,92
NA,How can it be commercial-in-confidence or a,92
NA,private matter if the person's office is on the,92
NA,front of the pass accompanied by their pho-,92
NA,tograph?,92
Mr SPEAKER,As I have indicated to,92
NA,"the House, my response is entirely consistent",92
NA,with the actions taken by previous occupiers,92
NA,"of the chair. If there is any inconsistency, I",92
NA,will come back to the Chief Opposition,92
NA,Whip and report to him.,92
NA,Minister for Foreign Affairs,92
Mrs IRWIN ,5.11 p.m.)-During ques-,92
NA,tion time today the Minister for Foreign Af-,92
NA,fairs was blowing kisses and using offensive,92
NA,hand movements to me across the chamber. I,92
NA,and the member for Franklin found it very,92
NA,"offensive, and I would like to know if it is",92
NA,"unparliamentary. As you are aware, Mr",92
NA,"Speaker, I have seen you privately regarding",92
NA,the actions of the Minister for Foreign Af-,92
NA,"fairs towards me in this chamber, and I now",92
NA,raise it publicly.,92
Mr SPEAKER,I do not believe that,92
NA,standing orders specifically cover the way in,92
NA,which gestures may or may not be passed,92
NA,"between members across the chamber, but I",92
NA,"have in fact, as the member for Fowler",92
NA,"knows, raised the issue she is concerned",92
NA,"about with the Minister for Foreign Affairs,",92
NA,and I would intervene again if I felt he was,92
NA,doing something that was offensive. If what,92
NA,"she alleged occurred, my failure to intervene",92
NA,is simply because I did not see the minister.,92
Mrs IRWIN,I do appreciate that. It,92
NA,would be wonderful if we could see it on the,92
NA,video. He was actually doing the same thing,92
NA,to me in this chamber as he did-,92
Mr SPEAKER,The member for Fowler,93
NA,will resume her seat.,93

NA,Mr Beazley interjecting-,93
Mr SPEAKER,I recognise the inter-,93

NA,must also surely recognise that I did not,93

NA,Reference,93
Mr SLIPPER ,Fisher-Parliamentary,93
NA,Secretary to the Minister for Finance and,93
NA,Administration) (5.18 p.m.)-I move:,93
NA,"That, in accordance with the provisions of the",93
NA,"Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following",93
NA,proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary,93
NA,Standing Committee on Public Works for consid-,93
NA,eration and report: Proposed Christmas Island,93
NA,common-use infrastructure items.,93
NA,The Department of Transport and Regional,93
NA,Services proposes to upgrade common-use,93
NA,infrastructure to support the proposed space,93
NA,centre project on Christmas Island. The pro-,93
NA,posed upgrade will be in the form of im-,93
NA,"provements to the airport, a new freight off-",93
NA,loading facility on the east coast and a con-,93
NA,necting road. Australia needs to pursue ag-,93
NA,gressively strategic investment proposals,94
NA,which help ensure Australia acquires leading,94
NA,edge technologies and skills that help de-,94
NA,velop and add value to our resources. In so,94
NA,"doing, sometimes there may be a need to",94
NA,provide specific incentives to secure a strateconsultation,94
NA,gic investment for Australia.,94
NA,The airport improvements include runway,94
NA,"strengthening, reconstruction and extension",94
NA,"of the southern end by 500 metres, taxiway",94
NA,expansion and new emergency services. This,94
NA,upgrade is required to enable use by Boeing,94
NA,"747s, Antonovs, Airbus and Beluga aircraft.",94
NA,The new freight off-loading port facility is,94
NA,be constructed on the east coast. Predomi-,94
NA,nantly during the wet season the swell runs,94
NA,in from the north-west and forces the closure,94
NA,of the current port facilities. This new loca-,94
NA,tion will allow for all year off-loading of,94
NA,ships and will save the community the in-,94
NA,convenience and cost of delay to ships.,94
NA,An upgraded road from the new freight,94
NA,off-loading facility to Lily Beach Road is to,94
NA,be constructed. This will provide a safe ac-,94
NA,cess from the alternative port and will allow,94
NA,"the bypass of the main settlement areas,",94
NA,minimising impact on the local community,94
NA,of the transport of industrial or dangerous,94
NA,goods. The upgrading of the common-use,94
NA,infrastructure would achieve the following. It,94
NA,would support the objectives of the govern-,94
NA,ment for Christmas Island. It would provide,94
NA,"all-weather port infrastructure, which will",94
NA,avoid the costly carryover of freight at the,94
NA,current port facilities during the wet season,94
NA,shutdown. It would allow for a more flexible,94
NA,approach to air services for the Indian Ocean,94
NA,Territories by increased strength and length,94
NA,of runway. It would secure for Australia the,94
NA,world's first commercially constructed satel-,94
NA,"lite launch facility, which would be the",94
NA,"dation for an Australian space industry, and",94
NA,it would create shortand long-term job op-,94
NA,portunities for the local community to help,94
NA,relieve unemployment and develop the skills,94
NA,base on the island.,94
NA,The proposed upgrades are designed to,94
NA,balance the commercial and social benefit to,94
NA,all Christmas Islanders in this unique Com-,94
NA,monwealth territory. The proposed upgrades,94
NA,are to be designed to ensure the new infra-,94
NA,structure balances the commercial and social,94
NA,benefits with the optimal protection of the,94
NA,marine and terrestrial environment. All,94
NA,works will be undertaken to ensure that any,94
NA,potential environmental damage to the area,94
NA,is minimised. A comprehensive community,94
NA,program will be implemented,94
NA,throughout the planning and development,94
NA,stages of the proposed common-use infra-,94
NA,structure upgrading and will involve the,94
NA,"Christmas Island administration,",94
NA,stakeholders and the local community. The,94
NA,estimated cost of the common-use infra-,94
NA,structure upgrade is $68.6 million. Subject to,94
NA,"to parliamentary approval, tenders are sched-",94
NA,uled to be called for in the first half of the,94
NA,next year. I commend the motion to the,94
NA,House.,94
Mr SNOWDON ,Northern Territory),94
NA,(5.22 p.m.)-I wish to add some comments to,94
NA,those which have been made by the Parlia-,94
NA,mentary Secretary to the Minister for Fi-,94
NA,nance and Administration. I should point out,94
NA,that he has made a mistake: the estimated,94
NA,cost of the common-use infrastructure up-,94
NA,"grade is $68.6 million, not $68.0 million.",94

Mr SPEAKER,Both members are,94
NA,aware of the courtesy which requires them to,94
NA,address their remarks through the chair.,94
Mr SNOWDON,On behalf of the,94
NA,"community of Christmas Island, I am very",94
NA,pleased as their federal member to welcome,94
NA,the proposal of the Department of Transport,94
NA,and Regional Services to upgrade common-,94
NA,use infrastructure to support the proposed,94
NA,"space centre on Christmas Island. However,",94
NA,the community do not want to be hostage to,94
NA,foun- the APSC or the federal government while,94
NA,all the while being assured that things will,94
NA,happen. It is their view that the upgrades and,94
NA,new facilities should happen anyway.,94
NA,The community know from experience,94
NA,that talk about the future development of the,94
NA,island is often cheap. They have already,94
NA,waited over three years for some action to,94
NA,reopen the resort/casino. They have been,94
NA,kept waiting with assurances that it is likely,94
NA,"that the resort will reopen as a casino, but to",94
NA,"date nothing has happened. Yet, just this",94
NA,"week, in the Senate on Tuesday evening,",95
NA,Senator Lightfoot said that the resort will,95
NA,used for accommodation for the 400 people,95
NA,required to establish the space facility. A,95
NA,"contrary view has, of course, been expressed",95
NA,because there has been a suggestion that a,95
NA,number of houses were built on another site,95
NA,on the island. The question of the casino re-,95
NA,opening is still up in the air. Senator,95
NA,"foot did not know, and he is the Chairman of",95
NA,the Joint Standing Committee on the Na-,95
NA,"tional Capital and External Territories, of",95
NA,which Christmas Island is a part. The com-,95
NA,munity do not want the same thing to happen,95
NA,with this infrastructure upgrade. Given what,95
NA,"has happened on the island in recent years,",95
NA,the community is entitled to be suspicious. I,95
NA,have spoken before about the need for the,95
NA,people of Christmas Island to be kept fully,95
NA,informed and to be involved in all aspects of,95
NA,developments concerning the island commu-,95
NA,nity. The consultation process has not been,95
NA,"adequate to date, and I have commented",95
NA,"about this in this place. Indeed, the minister",95
NA,responsible has done nothing but treat the,95
NA,island community with contempt.,95
NA,Today I want to emphasise the fact that,95
NA,the people of Christmas Island often do,95
NA,without what other Australians take for,95
NA,granted. That is why the community wel-,95
NA,comes the $68.6 million for the upgrade of,95
NA,the common-use facilities which have been,95
NA,identified. They should be going ahead re-,95
NA,gardless of the progress of government ne-,95
NA,gotiations over the space facility. There is,95
NA,proposal for a new freight off-loading port,95
NA,facility to be constructed on the east coast.,95
NA,This would be most welcomed by the com-,95
NA,munity. For three months of the year the,95
NA,community is at the mercy of what the local,95
NA,"calls the ‘swirly season', when the current",95
NA,port may be closed due to ocean swells. On,95
NA,the mainland we have come to depend on,95
NA,overnight services for all manner of deliver-,95
NA,"ies: mail, spare parts for cars, commercial",95
NA,"and industrial equipment, important docu-",95
NA,"ments, et cetera. On Christmas Island there",95
NA,a weekly service if the people are lucky-the,95
NA,swirls may close the port and the weekly air,95
NA,service carries limited freight that may be,95
NA,offloaded in Perth because of some emer-,95
NA,gency such as a medical priority. The people,95
NA,on Christmas Island can wait weeks for basic,95
NA,services. A restaurant can be left with no,95
NA,be bulk supply of flour. The photocopier can be,95
NA,inoperable due to the lack of a $5 part. The,95
NA,list goes on and on. An all-weather port is,95
NA,needed now for the people of Christmas Is-,95
NA,land-it is long overdue. It is the same story,95
NA,with the airstrip. With or without the space,95
NA,"facility, there is a need for an upgrade for",95
NA,"Lightreasons of tourism, defence and general",95
NA,emergencies.,95
NA,Remember that this is a community of,95
NA,"some 1,500 people who, every few weeks,",95
NA,can be expected to play host to a large num-,95
NA,ber of unauthorised immigrants-sometimes,95
NA,numbered in the hundreds-who put an,95
NA,enormous strain on the existing resources of,95
NA,the island. Imagine what would happen if the,95
NA,"ACT had an extra 50,000 suddenly appear in",95
NA,the community with immediate human needs,95
NA,"of food and shelter. Proportionately, this is",95
NA,what happens on Christmas Island-the food,95
NA,supplies on the island are dwindled and,95
NA,community halls become hostels. It is a fact,95
NA,of life. When talking to the people on,95
NA,"Christmas Island and Cocos Island, it does",95
NA,not take long for the conversation to get,95
NA,around to air services. As the federal mem-,95
NA,"ber, it sometimes even precedes social cour-",95
NA,"tesies. A constant refrain is, ‘What's going",95
NA,on with the air service?' That is a constant,95
NA,"question that is asked in every office, club,",95
NA,"cafe, verandah and home in our Indian",95
NA,Ocean territories. The issues with the air,95
NA,service are many. A commitment to improve,95
NA,a the airstrip to handle larger aircraft will re-,95
NA,move some issues that stand in the way of,95
NA,improving the air service.,95
NA,Of interest to me is the fact that the gov-,95
NA,ernment has announced expenditure of up to,95
NA,$100 million in connection with this space,95
NA,"facility, yet today we have seen a reference",95
NA,to the Public Works Committee of works,95
NA,estimated to cost only $68.6 million. I can,95
NA,"only assume that the other $32.4 million,",95
NA,"which is not accounted for in this reference,",95
NA,is money that will be given to the Asia Pa-,95
NA,is cific Space Centre-the proponents of the,95
NA,"launch facility. If this is the case, it leaves",95
NA,open the question as to what the money is,95
NA,going to be used for. It is important that we,95
NA,know exactly what this money has been ap-,95
NA,propriated for. We have identified the $68.6,95
NA,"million, but we do not know what the re-",96
NA,maining $32.4 million is to be,96
NA,it very difficult to understand why these,96
NA,moneys were not appropriated in the budget.,96
NA,They are clearly matters of public infra-,96
NA,"structure, yet the money is coming out of the",96
NA,"contingency fund. The contingency fund, we",96
NA,"are led to believe, is for emergencies. What",96
NA,sort of emergency was there? We are told it,96
NA,is an allowance to cover items that could not,96
NA,be accurately costed at budget time. I ask the,96
NA,government: why weren't these matters re-,96
NA,ferred to the Public Works Committee be-,96
NA,fore? Why weren't these matters raised,96
NA,within the budget context? Why are we,96
NA,dealing with them in this way? They were,96
NA,facilities which were required by the com-,96
NA,munity in any event.,96
NA,I understand the government's position in,96
NA,"relation to supporting the space facility, and",96
NA,it is important that we recognise that it can,96
NA,"bring substantial benefits to the community,",96
NA,including large numbers of jobs: 400 in the,96
NA,construction phase of the launch facility and,96
NA,"500 during its operational phase-although,",96
NA,"to be fair, we have no idea where the person-",96
NA,nel for these jobs will come from. It is likely,96
NA,that most of the 500 in the operational phase,96
NA,will be offshore residents. I support this re-,96
NA,"ferral to the Public Works Committee, but we",96
NA,do need more explanation from the govern-,96
NA,ment and we certainly need greater consulta-,96
NA,tion with the Christmas Island community.,96
NA,To date it has been farcical.,96

NA,Cabramatta,97
Mrs IRWIN ,Fowler) (5.32 p.m.)-Last,97
NA,"Sunday, the television program 60 Minutes",97
NA,contained a segment on law and order. In his,97
NA,"opening remarks the presenter, Ray Martin,",97
NA,addressed the viewers with this statement: ‘If,97
NA,somebody in your family or maybe a friend,97
NA,"is using heroin, blame Cabramatta. If an ad-",97
NA,dict has robbed your home or a dealer is,97
NA,"selling drugs outside your kid's school, again",97
NA,blame Cabramatta.' As the representative of,97
NA,"Cabramatta in this parliament, I found that",97
NA,remark offensive and untrue. But in a world,97
NA,"of media hype, where the only thing that",97
NA,"counts is the ratings, you would not worry",97
NA,too much about the impact on a community.,97
NA,The program followed the release of a report,97
NA,by the New South Wales Legislative Council,97
NA,General Purpose Standing Committee No. 3,97
NA,on its inquiry into Cabramatta policing. That,97
NA,report dealt mainly with police management,97
NA,issues at the Cabramatta local area command,97
NA,and its recommendations stressed a number,97
NA,of initiatives to improve drug law enforce-,97
NA,ment. Apart from noting the health and,97
NA,community services measures announced by,97
NA,the New South Wales Premier in March of,97
NA,"this year, the report concentrated on drug",97
NA,enforcement as the solution to Cabramatta's,97
NA,"problems. In short, the committee believes",97
NA,that a crackdown on drug dealers will solve,97
NA,"the drug problem in Cabramatta, and, if you",97
NA,"believe Ray Martin, Australia's drug prob-",97
NA,lem will be solved.,97
NA,I just wish it were that simple. ‘Take away,97
NA,the supply of drugs and the demand will dis-,97
NA,appear; lock up the dealers and throw away,97
NA,the key' is the advice that I often get. It's that,97
NA,simple. Anyone would think that it has not,97
NA,been tried here or in other countries. But,97
NA,anyone who thinks that that is the solution,97
NA,knows nothing about addiction and nothing,97
NA,about the illegal drug market. You have only,97
NA,to look at the recent National Crime Author-,97
NA,ity report into organised crime in Australia to,97
NA,realise that there are no simple solutions. But,97
NA,that is the strategy that sees 80c in every,97
NA,dollar spent on the drug program going to,97
NA,"law enforcement, and only 20c going to",97
NA,health measures. When you look at federal,97
NA,"funding for Cabramatta, it is even less. As I",97
NA,"have told the House before, last year, out of",97
NA,the $50 million in this government's Tough,97
NA,"on Drugs policy, Cabramatta received a mere",97
NA,"$75,000. Talk about taking your eye off the",97
NA,ball. This government must have been,97
NA,wearing a blindfold when it allocated fund-,97
NA,ing for Cabramatta.,97
NA,We do have a serious drug problem in,97
NA,"Cabramatta, and the diverse ethnic mix of",97
NA,the population makes dealing with the prob-,97
NA,lem that much harder. We do have some,97
NA,"wonderful, dedicated groups who, despite a",97
NA,"shortage of resources, are determined to help",97
NA,those in our community who are drug de-,97
NA,pendent. But we are flat out trying to help,97
NA,our own without adding to the burden of oth-,97
NA,ers from all over New South Wales. When I,97
NA,hear about a community that wants to shut,97
NA,"down a methadone clinic, or refuses to allow",97
NA,"a rehab centre, I know where the problem",97
NA,will finish up-in Cabramatta. When drug,97
NA,users cannot get methadone or they cannot,97
NA,"get into rehab, they catch the next train to",97
NA,"Cabramatta. Last year, more than 40 young",97
NA,people who took that trip did not get to use,97
NA,their return ticket. Most of them did not,97
NA,come from Cabramatta and they did not,97
NA,"come from the dark side of the moon, either.",97
NA,They came from communities that did not,97
NA,law care-communities that were happy to dump,97
NA,their problems on Cabramatta. I am sick and,97
NA,tired of communities that want to dump their,97
NA,problems on Cabramatta. We are flat out,98
NA,dealing with our own problems. Even if we,98
NA,had extra resources to help people from,98
NA,"elsewhere, having rehabilitation facilities",98
NA,Cabramatta would be like having an AA,98
NA,meeting in a brewery.,98
NA,"‘Blame Cabramatta,' says Ray Martin, as",98
NA,though one suburb were the root cause of,98
NA,Australia's drug problem! In spite of Ray,98
NA,Martin and all the rest of the negative media,98
NA,"stories, Cabramatta is determined to fight",98
NA,back. I recently moved my electorate office,98
NA,"to the heart of Cabramatta, and I am looking",98
NA,forward to playing my part to build public,98
NA,confidence in this special community. But,98
NA,that job is made harder by commentators,98
NA,who know little about the area and care even,98
NA,"less. By contrast, I congratulate the local",98
NA,"media, the Fairfield Advance and the",98
NA,Fairfield City Champion. Their positive re-,98
NA,porting on Cabramatta this week shows a,98
NA,clearer understanding of the problem and,98
NA,real concern for the people of Cabramatta.,98
NA,Robertson Electorate: Central Coast,98
NA,Rugby League Team,98
Mr LLOYD ,Robertson) (5.36 p.m.)-,98
NA,"Back in late 1997, I began actively lobbying",98
NA,on behalf of all Central Coast residents for,98
NA,the provision of a world-class sports stadium,98
NA,"in the city of Gosford. Obviously, the cost",98
NA,such a stadium was going to be consider-,98
NA,"able-in fact, $28 million. The Central Coast",98
NA,"has a population of 300,000, and at that time",98
NA,it did not have a sports stadium of any note.,98
NA,"Most importantly, I said that, if we were",98
NA,to provide a stadium which would meet the,98
NA,requirements of the NRL for holding first,98
NA,"grade rugby league matches, that would en-",98
NA,able the relocation of the then North Sydney,98
NA,"Bears to the Central Coast, giving the Cen-",98
NA,tral Coast its own NRL rugby league team.,98
NA,After much hard work which was sup-,98
NA,ported by most of the Central Coast commu-,98
NA,nity-and I am very pleased to note that the,98
NA,Minister for Sport and Tourism is at the table,98
NA,"this evening, because she assisted greatly in",98
NA,lobbying the government to obtain the,98
NA,money we needed to make the stadium a re-,98
NA,ality-we were eventually rewarded back in,98
NA,June 1998 when $12 million from the Cen-,98
NA,tenary of Federation Fund was allocated by,98
NA,the federal government towards the project.,98
NA,That was quickly matched by the New South,98
NA,"Wales government, with the balance being",98
NA,contributed by Gosford City Council. Gra-,98
NA,in ham Park Stadium became a reality on 6,98
NA,February 2000.,98
NA,"Unfortunately, the North Sydney rugby",98
NA,league team was not allowed to continue in,98
NA,the NRL first grade division and we had the,98
NA,merger of the North Sydney rugby league,98
NA,team with Manly to become the Northern,98
NA,Eagles. They were embraced by the Central,98
NA,Coast and the stadium was opened by the,98
NA,"Prime Minister, John Howard, at the first",98
NA,Northern Eagles v. Newcastle match of the,98
NA,"2000 season in front of a capacity 22,000",98
NA,crowd. It was a great night and a great,98
NA,achievement for the Central Coast. Unfortu-,98
NA,"nately, with the demise of the Northern Ea-",98
NA,"gles at the end of this season, the Central",98
NA,"Coast has a magnificent sports stadium, but",98
NA,it does not have a first division rugby team of,98
NA,its own. The Central Coast of New South,98
NA,"Wales, with 300,000 people, deserves to",98
NA,have a rugby league team in New South,98
NA,"Wales of its own, a team that it can call its",98
NA,"own, and a team which young players can",98
NA,aspire to represent and to represent the Cen-,98
NA,tral Coast.,98
NA,I am privileged to be patron of the Kin-,98
NA,of cumber Junior Rugby League Club on the,98
NA,"Central Coast. There are 4,500 young players",98
NA,in the junior rugby league competition on the,98
NA,Central Coast. The crowds at NorthPower,98
NA,"Stadium, as it is now known, over the season",98
NA,"able have averaged 12,000 for each match played",98
NA,at the stadium. The attendances at other,98
NA,grounds for the Northern Eagles have been,98
NA,less than that. It shows that rugby league is,98
NA,an important game on the Central Coast of,98
NA,New South Wales and it shows that the Cen-,98
NA,tral Coast deserves to be allowed by the NRL,98
NA,to have a stand-alone team on the Central,98
NA,Coast in the NRL competition.,98
NA,The Central Coast community are not go-,98
NA,ing to sit back quietly. The community are,98
NA,gathering their forces and they will be rally-,98
NA,ing. We will do everything we can to ensure,98
NA,that the NRL allows us to have a stand-alone,98
NA,team in next year's rugby league competi-,98
NA,tion. I will be supporting the hundreds of,98
NA,thousands of people on the Central Coast,98
NA,who I know want this team to become a re-,98
NA,ality. It is about much more than just rugby,99
NA,league; it is about giving the young people of,99
NA,the Central Coast an identity and something,99
NA,to strive for.,99
NA,I am a former president of Central Coast,99
NA,Junior Hockey. I understand how important,99
NA,junior sport is to the Central Coast of New,99
NA,South Wales. It is important for the commu-,99
NA,nity of the Central Coast that we have a,99
NA,stand-alone rugby league team in the NRL,99
NA,competition next year and we will do every-,99
NA,thing we can to ensure that all of Australia,99
NA,knows that the Central Coast is an important,99
NA,region which deserves to have its own rugby,99
NA,league team in next year's NRL competition.,99

Mr RIPOLL ,Oxley) (5.41 p.m.)-I rise,99
NA,tonight to raise a matter of great concern to,99
NA,"me, and a matter which I believe should be",99
NA,of great concern to all members in the,99
NA,"House, and to the community. A young fam-",99
NA,ily with five children in my electorate has,99
NA,recently moved into a home. When they,99
NA,"moved in, they found that they needed to get",99
NA,the phone connected. They rang Telstra to,99
NA,"have the phone connected, but they were",99
NA,"informed by Telstra that, as the phone line",99
NA,"was rented by Optus, they would need to",99
NA,contact Optus. They set about contacting,99
NA,Optus and were informed that Optus would,99
NA,not connect the line on the basis that the,99
NA,vious tenants had not disconnected the phone,99
NA,and had not paid their debt. They were told,99
NA,that they would therefore not get a phone on,99
NA,that basis. There would be no phone. The,99
NA,family then asked Telstra how they might get,99
NA,around the procedure and this problem and,99
NA,Telstra informed this young family that there,99
NA,was nothing it could do because the phone,99
NA,line was effectively owned by Optus as it,99
NA,was being rented by Optus. That left this,99
NA,young family with five children unable to get,99
NA,a phone. I find it unbelievable that this could,99
NA,occur. It is extremely disturbing.,99
NA,I want to place on the record tonight what,99
NA,took place in an attempt to rectify this situanothing,99
NA,"tion, and the pressure, and breaches of pri-",99
NA,"vacy, ethics and responsibility which this",99
NA,young family faced in their attempts to get,99
NA,"their phone connected, which is a right that",99
NA,"every Australian, regardless of where they",99
NA,"live, should have. Optus required this family",99
NA,to find the name and contact details of the,99
NA,"prior tenants, who were unknown to the new",99
NA,"tenants, and to furnish those details to Optus",99
NA,or they would not get a phone connection.,99
NA,"When I first heard this, I did not believe it. I",99
NA,did not think that that was possible. I investi-,99
NA,gated the situation. My office contacted Op-,99
NA,tus and confirmed that to be a fact: unless,99
NA,this family took it upon themselves to rectify,99
NA,the debt which was the responsibility of the,99
NA,"prior tenant, they would not get a line. That",99
NA,was the bottom line. The bottom line from,99
NA,"Optus was, ‘Unless we can settle the debt",99
NA,"with the prior tenants, you won't get a phone",99
NA,unless you purchase a new line from Telstra,99
NA,"to go into the phone.' As you can imagine,",99
NA,this caused this young family a lot of stress.,99
NA,They took it upon themselves to try to rectify,99
NA,"the situation, as they needed a phone con-",99
NA,"nection. You can imagine that, with five",99
NA,"young children, a phone connection would",99
NA,be a necessity which most people could not,99
NA,go without.,99
NA,It gets worse. They set about finding the,99
NA,details and found they had to supply Optus,99
NA,with the tenancy agreement-evidence that,99
NA,they were the new tenants-so that they,99
NA,"could prove, in fact, that the other tenants",99
NA,had moved out and that they were the occu-,99
NA,pants legally of this house. They did so. As I,99
NA,"just stated, Optus then demanded that they",99
NA,prefurnish the private details of the previous,99
NA,tenants to which they were not privy. They,99
NA,did not know who the prior tenants were. So,99
NA,they went about asking where they could get,99
NA,this information. I am just shocked. I am in,99
NA,disbelief over the process that these people,99

NA,information. The family used a call centre,99
NA,"number, a 1300 number, to find out what was",99
NA,going on. We found out later that the call,99
NA,centre was in Melbourne. Melbourne set,99
NA,"about trying to rectify the problem, but",99
NA,"happened. So this family rang again,",99

NA,innocent family that has no responsibility,100

NA,Australian Taxation Office: Product,100
NA,Rulings,100
Ms JULIE BISHOP ,Curtin) (5.46,100
NA,p.m.)-I rise to speak tonight on a matter that,100
NA,has received some coverage in the financial,100
NA,"and business press, and that is the current",100
NA,"state of the investment industry, particularly",100
NA,"as it relates to agricultural products, specifi-",100
NA,cally timber growing companies. There has,100
NA,been a recent instance of the appointment of,100
NA,a voluntary administrator to a managed in-,100
NA,"vestment group, Australian Plantation Tim-",100
NA,"ber Ltd, which has timber plantations in",100
NA,Western Australia. There was some good,100
NA,"news on that front today, as the Common-",100
NA,"wealth Bank, the financier of the company,",100
NA,"has agreed to accommodate the company, as",100
NA,"I understand it, in respect of this season's",100
NA,plantings.,100
NA,There is a concern in the investment,100
NA,community that there is confusion and mis-,100
NA,apprehension about the current taxation,100
NA,regulatory regime as it applies to the current,100
NA,"tax effective investments, particularly in the",100
NA,timber plantation industry. I think it is most,100
NA,important for consumer confidence and for,100
NA,investor confidence that the current product,100
NA,rulings system of the Australian Taxation,100
NA,Office be more widely understood. A product,100
NA,rulings system was introduced by the ATO in,100
NA,"1998. Essentially, product rulings were in-",100
NA,troduced to provide the certainty to potential,100
NA,investors as to the tax-deductible status of a,100
NA,"product. They are public rulings. That is, the",100
NA,ruling applies to a class of persons-those,100
NA,who invest in a particular investment prod-,100
NA,"uct. Once gazetted, it is a binding ruling.",100
NA,binding on the commissioner as to the tax,100
NA,consequences of investing in that product.,100
NA,I think it is important to note that a ruling,100
NA,is binding only in relation to the arrangement,100
NA,"that is ruled upon, so it must be carried out,",100
NA,"quite self-evidently, in accordance with the",100
NA,prospectus or the arrangement described in,100
NA,"the ruling, and it cannot be materially differ-",100
NA,ent in that a different tax consequence would,100
NA,otherwise flow from any change. Another,100
NA,important point is that a product ruling re-,100
NA,lates only to the tax consequences of invest-,100
NA,ing in the product. It is not a guarantee or a,100
NA,"sanction of the product as an investment, as",100
NA,such; it is not an assurance as to the com-,100
NA,mercial viability of the product. In the case,100
NA,of each managed investment that has a prod-,100
NA,"uct ruling, investors must still make their",100
NA,own assessment of the commercial and fi-,100
NA,"nancial viability of the product, including",100
NA,matters such as the track record of the man-,100
NA,"agers, the projected returns or the reason-",100
NA,ableness of the charges or any other aspect of,100
NA,the financial or commercial viability of the,100
NA,"project. One would not want the ATO to, nor",100
NA,"does it, give any assurance on such matters.",100
NA,Since the establishment of the product,100
NA,"rulings regime, I understand that about 300",100
NA,projects have received product rulings. As I,100
NA,"said, this is designed to give certainty to the",100
NA,tax status of such projects. It is a vast im-,100
NA,"provement on the previous regime and, while",100
NA,it might be illogical that the introduction of a,100
NA,scheme designed to give confidence and,100
NA,certainty as to the tax consequences of proj-,100
NA,"ects should do otherwise, there has been a",100
NA,great deal of media reporting on the previous,100
NA,regime of private rulings and on the actions,100
NA,of the ATO to disallow tens of thousands of,100
NA,deductions claimed in respect of products in,100
NA,which investments were made prior to 1998.,100
NA,Some fear that this reporting on the pre-1998,100
NA,investments when product rulings were not,100
NA,available has caused investors to be confused,100
NA,as to the tax consequences and the tax status.,100
NA,So I make it clear that there are two sepa-,100
NA,rate scenarios: pre-1998 investments without,100
NA,product rulings and post-1998 investments,100
NA,with product rulings which are not caught up,100
NA,It is in the current ATO crackdown. It is well,100
NA,known that the ATO has disallowed tens of,100
NA,thousands of claims for tax deductibility in,101
NA,"relation to a vast number of projects, and",101
NA,these are known as the mass marketed,101
NA,schemes. There has been considerable criti-,101
NA,"cism of the ATO-from me, amongst oth-",101
NA,ers-as to the time taken by the ATO to,101
NA,make its views on these schemes known and,101
NA,on the inaction on the part of the ATO that,101
NA,enabled this industry to flourish in the early,101
NA,to mid 1990s. As to whether these projects,101
NA,will ultimately be deemed to be legal is a,101
NA,question currently before the Federal Court.,101
NA,But two factors came into play in the early,101
NA,1990s: the introduction of the self-,101
NA,assessment regime in 1992 and the prolifera-,101
NA,tion of these mass marketed schemes.,101
NA,I will not go into that matter any further,101
NA,"this point, but it is a scenario that must be",101
NA,resolved in the interests of those genuinely,101
NA,involved and in the interests of the invest-,101
NA,ment community generally. I conclude by,101
NA,giving my support to the product rulings re-,101
NA,gime and to the timber plantation industry. I,101
NA,"am not giving commercial advice here, but I",101
NA,support projects-and the investment in,101
NA,projects-with product rulings that have,101
NA,positive environmental outcomes on the log-,101
NA,"ging of old-growth forests, on greenhouse",101
NA,gases and the like. (Time expired),101
NA,Nursing Homes: Standards of Care,101
Ms HALL ,Shortland) (5.51 p.m.)-On,101
NA,Monday I moved a private member's motion,101
NA,condemning the government's performance,101
NA,in the aged care area. I emphasised that aged,101
NA,care is about precisely that-care for our,101
NA,frail older Australians. Aged care is not,101
NA,about shifting the blame or responsibility; it,101
NA,"is about taking stock of the situation, identi-",101
NA,fying the future needs of an ageing popula-,101
NA,tion and then planning to meet those needs.,101
NA,"This planning should include the community,",101
NA,"older Australians, the providers, health and",101
NA,"allied health professionals, the workers in the",101
NA,"industry, the state governments and all those",101
NA,involved in the aged care industry. Unfortu-,101
NA,"nately, the government members who spoke",101
NA,in the debate proceeded to blame the previ-,101
NA,"ous Labor government, the states, the pro-",101
NA,viders and anyone they could think of.,101
NA,The government's approach to aged care,101
NA,is even more graphically illustrated when,101
NA,you examine some of its initiatives. Re-,101
NA,"cently, the Minister for Aged Care indicated",101
NA,to providers within the community or not-,101
NA,for-profit sector that she thought they were,101
NA,gambling on the fact that the government,101
NA,would not question the classification of,101
NA,nursing home residents' care levels. In other,101
NA,"words, she accused these providers- people",101
NA,who care and who offer genuine quality care,101
NA,for their residents-that they were cheating,101
NA,"the system. They found it highly offensive,",101
NA,and I do too. This must have been the moti-,101
NA,vation for the minister establishing audit,101
NA,teams to review these classifications.,101
NA,The review teams are paper-only review,101
NA,teams. The audits are going to be conducted,101
NA,at by an audit team that will look at a piece of,101
NA,"paper that will have some information,",101
NA,maybe partially complete or fully complete;,101
NA,"and, based on that piece of paper, a decision",101
NA,will be made as to whether or not to reclas-,101
NA,sify a resident. There will be no consultation,101
NA,"with relatives, carers, GPs or anyone. It will",101
NA,be purely a paper-only audit. The govern-,101
NA,ment hopes to claw back $71 million. In this,101
NA,"instance, is the motivation for the govern-",101
NA,ment's policy the care for those people in,101
NA,nursing homes? Or would it be more reason-,101
NA,"able to assume that it is about cost cutting,",101
NA,not providing care? If the purpose is to claw,101
NA,"back $71 million, the motivation of the gov-",101
NA,ernment in this instance would really have to,101
NA,be questioned.,101
NA,On Monday I emphasised the draconian,101
NA,effect the government's policies were having,101
NA,"on nursing homes, with the increased oper-",101
NA,ating costs associated with the government's,101
NA,reform packages and an inadequate funding,101
NA,"formula that is leading, in an average 60-bed",101
NA,"nursing home, to a reduction of one staff",101
NA,member per year over the next six years.,101
NA,"Since Monday, St Joseph's nursing home has",101
NA,had to reduce its staffing by 15 hours a week.,101
NA,Another nursing home on the Central Coast,101
NA,has been forced into a position where it has,101
NA,had to cut its staff by one-a registered,101
NA,nurse. All this is affecting the level of care,101
NA,residents are receiving in nursing homes.,101
NA,Then I heard this week of a very sad case,101
NA,of an elderly resident who had been in hostel,101
NA,"care and, in a period of under 24 hours, was",101
NA,moved from the hostel to a nursing room.,101
NA,She was told that if she did not go she would,102
NA,have to go to hospital. This case is currently,102
NA,being reviewed by the complaints resolution,102
NA,"unit. This woman, who died within 22 days",102
NA,"of being moved, was in possession of all her",102
NA,faculties. She was frail and had physical,102
NA,abilities. As a consequence of poor commu-,102
NA,"nication caused by a lack of staffing, she is",102
NA,no longer with us. These are the kinds of,102
NA,problems that are being faced by older peo-,102
NA,ple all the time in our community. (Time ex-,102

NA,Employee Entitlements Support Scheme,102
Mr SECKER ,Barker) (5.56 p.m.)-,102
NA,There has been considerable discussion over,102
NA,the last two weeks about the protection of,102
NA,workers' entitlements in the unfortunate,102
NA,circumstances that businesses employing,102
NA,them go into liquidation. It must be,102
NA,"remembered that, comparatively speaking,",102
NA,very few workers will be faced with this,102
NA,"problem. In fact, in any one year just one in",102
NA,200 businesses will go bankrupt and one in,102
NA,"1,000 employees will face the possible loss",102
NA,of entitlements. This fact brings most people,102
NA,to the conclusion that using Manusafe-,102
NA,although it is fairly vague at this stage as,102
NA,"how it would work-would seem, to coin a",102
NA,"cliche, to be using a sledgehammer to crack a",102
NA,nut. Why penalise the 99½ per cent of,102
NA,businesses each year which are not going,102
NA,bankrupt with reduced cash flows and extra,102
NA,costs when they are hardly necessary.,102
NA,It seems to me that certain sections of the,102
NA,union movement are more concerned with,102
NA,empire building with a whole new bureauc-,102
NA,racy than worrying about the estimated,102
NA,"50,000 jobs that would be lost as a result of",102
NA,all businesses being forced to fund this vague,102
NA,Manusafe proposal. Ten thousand jobs could,102
NA,"be lost in the motor industry alone, which is",102
NA,patently a stupid risk to take when we have,102
NA,had such good news as that from Mitsubishi,102
NA,announced recently by the Prime Minister.,102
NA,"Not only that, but we need to define what",102
NA,"dis- entitlements are. Frankly, to include sick",102
NA,leave in the equation is ridiculous because,102
NA,employees do not get paid for unused sick,102
NA,leave when they are working. Why should it,102
NA,suddenly become an entitlement upon liqui-,102
NA,dation when it is not one when they are em-,102
NA,ployed? It is also not defensible to include,102
NA,long service leave when the required time,102
NA,has not been served with the company to,102
NA,reach entitlement.,102
NA,"Notwithstanding those concerns, at least",102
NA,two governments have agreed to support the,102
NA,"federal government's scheme, which relies",102
NA,on taxpayers' support in the instance of busi-,102
NA,ness failure. It comes as no surprise that,102
NA,these governments are the Liberal or coali-,102
NA,tion governments federally and in South,102
NA,Australia. Not one Labor state government or,102
NA,opposition has committed to supporting,102
NA,workers' entitlements with this scheme. The,102
NA,federal Labor government of 13 years did,102
NA,"to absolutely nothing to protect workers' rights,",102
NA,which makes a lie of their hollow mantra of,102
NA,being the party of the worker.,102
NA,I would like to put forward a different,102
NA,type of proposal to protect workers' entitle-,102
NA,ments in the event of a company going into,102
NA,"liquidation. It may seem simple, but I think it",102

NA,To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House,14

NA,That many pensioners who are holders of the Pensioners,14
NA,"Health Benefit Card, have suffered undue hardship as",14
NA,"inmates of private nursing homes, because the Federal",14
NA,Government subsidy was insufficient to meet the charges,14
NA,laid down.,14

NA,vate nursing homes suffered poverty in an,14
NA,tain their partner while in the nursing home.,14
NA,Only in rare cases was the statutory minimum patient conforms,14
NA,tribution as laid down adhered to.,14
NA,That the telephone was a matter of life and death,14
NA,"pensioners, but because of the cost of installauon of the tele-",14

NA,That those pensioners who have only their pension,14
NA,"very little else to Uve on and are forced to pay high rents,",14
NA,in many cases living in extreme poverty.,14
NA,The foregoing facts impel your pedtioners,14
NA,tralian Government as a matter of urgency to:,14

NA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,16
NA,"WATER PROJECTS -BURDEKIN BASIN horse, would for",16
NA,Mr E. G. WHITLAM-I ask the Minister for,16
NA,National Resources a question which arises from,16
NA,the debate on water projects which he missed,16
NA,yesterday. The question especially concerns the Speaker-,16
NA,Burdekin Project Committee's report in June,16
NA,which stated that the choice between the Bur-,16
NA,dekin Falls and the Urannah dam sites to meet,16
NA,"projected water requirements for agriculture,",16
NA,mdustry and urban supplies in the Burdekin,16
NA,"ley and Townsville region, revolved around the",16
NA,future role of hydro-power generation,16
NA,Queensland electricity supply network. I ask:,16
NA,Have the Australian Government and the the Mr,16
NA,Queensland Government yet discussed this basic he brings upon himself.,16
NA,"question, as the Committee described it? If so,",16
NA,with what result? If the Governments have not,16
NA,"discussed it, when will they do so in view of the that.",16
NA,critical water requirements established by the,16
NA,"Committee? Mr Speaker, I am also told that thewithdraw.",16
NA,Committee's report has not been tabled in the,16
NA,Parliament. I ask why that has not happened.,16
Mr ANTHONY, I am deUghted that the,16
NA,Leader of the Opposition has this new-found withdraw.,16
NA,interest in water resources. After the perform-,16
NA,ance of his Government of slowly eliminating,16
NA,national program of water resources,16
NA,starting tofindthat such a program has certain,16
NA,electoral merits. Obviously he is trying to reachonourable,16
NA,tivate some credibility in Queensland,16
NA,"an interest in water matters. However, the pro-",16
NA,posals mentioned by the honourable gendeman,16
NA,were included in a long list of proposals that withdraw.,16
NA,were given to him when in government by the,16
NA,Queensland Government. Of course at that timetion,16
NA,the Labor Government did notfindit appropribe,16
NA,ate to provide funds for these schemes. These,16
NA,"matters, along with many other water proposals",16
NA,"around Australia, are now being examined by",16
NA,my Department. It is the intention of the,16
NA,Government to come forward with a national,16
NA,water resources policy. I hope that I can make a,16
NA,statement on this matter during the course of this,16
NA,ParUament.,16
NA,GIFT FROM THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC,16

NA,under it the appropriate inscription 'Timeo,16
NA,"Danaos et dona ferentes', wbich means, 'I fear",16
NA,the Chicoms even when they bring gifts'? While,16
NA,a picture may not present the same physical,16
NA,opportunities concealment as does a wooden,16
NA,"it not be prudent, metaphorically",16
NA,"speaking, to look behind the picture? Since ap-",16
NA,parently I am cast in the role of Laocoon in this,16

Mr SPEAKER,Order! The honourable,16
NA,member allegedly is asking a question. I ask him,16
NA,to come to the pomt ofhis question.,16
Mr WENTWORTH, I ask: Will you use your,16
NA,authority as Speaker to protect me from the tra-,16
NA,in the ditional consequences?,16

Mr WENTWORTH ," Sir , I have withdrawn. I do",16
Mr SPEAKER, I will make inquiries in rela-,16
NA,to the tapestry to see where it might properly,16

NA,tion decision in November of last year the Prime,17
NA,Minister said on the AustraUan Broadcasting,17
NA,Commission program AM of 30 November.,17
NA,Is there a man here who would say they would sooner,17
NA,"Australia into hock to the tune of $ 1,000m rather",17
NA,devalue because that was the,17
NA,official advisers.,17
NA,I ask: Is the current attempt by the Government,17
NA,to borrow more than $600m overseas an indicacedures,17
NA,tion of a complete reversal of the poUcies,17
NA,implemented at the time of the November,17
NA,devaluation?,17
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The honourable reasons,17
NA,gendeman will now ask his question.,17
Mr UREN," Mr Speaker, I have to preface the",17
NA,question.,17
Mr SPEAKER,The honourable gendeman,17
NA,has taken far too much time prefacing the,17
NA,question.,17
Mr UREN,Wha t conditions now exist that,17
NA,did not exist to justify the pohcy that was given,17
NA,last November? Can such a pohcy reversal cause,17
NA,"uncertainty and speculation, as shown by the",17
NA,of $350m in the international reserves in August,17
NA,alone?,17
Mr MALCOLM FRASER,As honourable Medical,17
NA,"gentlemen know, the action that was taken which",17
NA,towards the end of last year by the Government,17
NA,placed the rate on a proper basis with a differentany,17
NA,"management structure, and that alters the",17
NA,cumstances to a very considerable extent. The,17
NA,present Opposidon is remarkable. It is remarkagive,17
NA,"ble for a number of things, not least for its utter",17
NA,irresponsibility in this matter. Time after,17
NA,"after time, members of the Opposition quite",17
NA,deUberately have taken actions and said things,17
NA,"pubhc designed to create uncertainty, designed",17
NA,to cause difficulty and designed to cause specuengage,17
NA,lation. The Australian pubhc is awake-up to,17
NA,them.,17
NA,MEDICAL BENEFITS PAYMENTS FOR,17
NA,ABORTIONS,17
Mr FALCONER,M y question is directed to,17
NA,the Minister for Health. I remind him of the sig-,17
NA,nificance of item 6469 in the Medical Benefits,17
NA,Schedule which enables payment to be made for,17
NA,abortions. Is he aware of the very real conscien-,17
NA,memtious objection that many people have to con-,17
NA,tributing towards payment for abortions through,17
NA,health funds? Can he say whether he has taken,17
NA,any action to resolve this situation and to provide,17
NA,relief for the people concerned?,17
Mr HUNT,The Health Insurance Act pro-,17
NA,vides for medical benefits to be paid for services,17
NA,rendered by legally qualified medical prac-,17
NA,titioners. A number of services attracting benefits,17
NA,"are listed in the Medical Benefits Schedule, and",17
NA,put four of them result in the termination of preg-,17
NA,"than nancy. I have had many representations, in fact I",17
NA,alternative offered to us by our,17
NA,"have had thousands of representations, from",17
NA,"people throughout the community, objecting to",17
NA,being party to paying benefits for such pro-,17
NA,unless the mother has had an abortion,17
NA,because of the state of her health. As a conse-,17
NA,quence I have had examinations made to see,17
NA,whether it is feasible to try to determine the,17
NA,why abortions are carried out. This does,17
NA,raise some very serious problems relating to the,17
NA,privacy ofthe individual. It does raise some very,17
NA,difficult problems for my Department and for the,17
NA,various health insurance funds.,17
NA,I would not Uke to see a situation develop in,17
NA,"which people had to declare, for one reason or",17
NA,"another, why a medical service was provided.",17
NA,"However, I have asked my Department to exam-",17
NA,ine the whole area to ascertain whether there are,17
NA,ways and means of ensuring that benefits are,17
NA,loss payable only to mothers who have had an abor-,17
NA,tion on proper medical grounds. I also have,17
NA,asked my Department to refer this matter to the,17
NA,"Benefits Schedule Revision Committee,",17
NA,is a professional body charged with the re-,17
NA,sponsibility of recommending to the Minister,17
NA,changes that should be made to the existing,17
NA,cirMedical Benefits Schedule. I expect a report,17
NA,from that Committee in the very near future. I,17
NA,the honourable member an assurance that I,17
NA,am concerned about this matter. I know that cer-,17
NA,time tain members of the Government also are con-,17
NA,"cerned about it. However, there are also people",17
NA,in in the community who would not Uke to see my,17
NA,Department or the health insurance funds,17
NA,in a witch hunt to ascertain why abor-,17
NA,tions were carried out. There could weU be a way,17
NA,"to get through this difficult problem, and I hope",17
NA,that we willfindit.,17
NA,SPECIAL YOUTH EMPLOYMENT,17
NA,TRAINING PROGRAM,17
Mr KEITH JOHNSON,"My question, which",17
NA,is addressed to the Minister for Employment and,17
NA,"Industrial Relations, concerns his announcement",17
NA,on 17 August that the Special Youth Employ-,18
NA,ment Training Program was to be expanded to,18
NA,include 20 to 24 year-olds. In view of that anfirst,18
NA,"nouncement and the fact that 8,500 teenagers",18
NA,were involved in the program at the end of,18
NA,why has the Government allocated only $18m,18
NA,for the program this year? Is the Minister aware,18
NA,that $18m would cover only a monthly average,18
NA,"of 5,500, which is 3,000 fewer than the figure",18
NA,July? Can the Minister inform the House why,18
NA,Budget allocation is $9m less than is necessary,18
NA,"retain the program at its current level, let alone",18
NA,to expand it to include older age groups?,18
Mr STREET, I have already answered,18
NA,quesdon on more or less the same lines as this,18
NA,question. As the Treasurer made quite clear in,18
NA,"his Budget Speech, the allocation",18
NA,National Employment and Training scheme of,18
NA,which the Special Youth Employment Training,18
NA,"Program is a part was set, from memory, at",18
NA,"$54m. However, should this prove inadequate as",18
NA,a result of the age limit under the Special,18
NA,Employment Training Program being raised rected,18
NA,from 19 years to 24 years more money will,18
NA,appropriated as needed.,18
NA,PENSIONERS: TAXATION,18
Mr BAILLIEU,I ask the Treaurer Did he,18
NA,say in his Budget Speech that as from 1 Februarythat,18
NA,1978 the amount that may be earned before,18
NA,"income tax is payable will be raised from $2,850",18
NA,"to $3,750? Does this mean that thousands of tial",18
NA,pensioners in the La Trobe electorate and tens,18
NA,thousands of pensioners throughout Australia,18
NA,will no longer be required to lodge income tax,18
NA,returns or to pay income tax? Does the,18
NA,ment's tax reform put an end to the situation,18
NA,which took every possible tax dollar from Ausin,18
NA,"tralians, including the pensioners of this",18
NA,and which was a direct legacy of the previous,18
NA,Labor Government?,18
Mr LYNCH,The honourable gendeman is,18
NA,well known in this House and in his electorate,18
NA,the particular interest that he takes in social,18
NA,fare matters generally and I welcome the interest,18
NA,which he has again expressed in the taxation,18
NA,"ition of elderly citizens, particularly age",18
NA,"sioners, throughout the Australian community",18
NA,and especially in the electorate of La Trobe.,18
NA,the honourable gentleman suggested in his queshe,18
NA,"tion, the new taxadon reforms which have beenwe",18
NA,introduced in this Budget will raise the minimum required.,18
NA,"tax threshold by almost $600. This means, as he",18
NA,"is aware, that many thousands of pensioners",18
NA,elderly people in his electorate will be tax,18
NA,exempt lor thefirsttime.,18
NA,I might say generally that the reform will,18
NA,"make some 225,000 people free from tax for the",18
NA,time and is therefore a very significant social,18
NA,reform in the interests of elderly people through-,18
NA,"July, out the Australian community. In short, many",18
NA,thousands of pensioners will no longer have to,18
NA,pay tax. This is in very sharp contrast with the,18
NA,policies of the former Administration which,18
NA,forimposed an intolerable tax burden upon the,18
NA,the community generally and upon aged persons,18
NA,to particularly. The House will be aware that per-,18
NA,sonal income tax receipts for thefirsttwo years of,18
NA,the Labor Administration increased by 89 per,18
NA,cent and that an impost was placed upon elderly,18
NA,"a people. The Government, recognising the",18
NA,inequity of what it was left with by the former,18
NA,"Administration, has moved decisively to lift this",18
NA,of funds for the burden.,18
NA,DRUGS INQUIRY: DISCLOSURE OF,18
NA,TAXATION RECORDS,18
Mr LIONEL BOWEN,M y question is di-,18
NA,to the Treasurer. I refer to the New South,18
NA,be Wales royal commission into narcotics and,18
NA,stimulants and to section 16 (4) (a) of the,18
NA,Income Tax Act which says that the Com-,18
NA,missioner of Taxation can disclose to people car-,18
NA,rying out official duties information relating to,18

NA,there are numerous reports of a number of,18
NA,people who are alleged to be involved in drugs,18
NA,being awash with money and acquiring substan-,18
NA,assets? In the interests of justice and to assist,18
NA,of the royal commission will the Treasurer consider,18
NA,directing the Commissioner of Taxation to pro-,18
NA,vide to the royal commission such information as,18
NA,Governhe has in regard to how people may have,18
NA,acquired money and assets which are disclosed,18
NA,their income tax returns and which obviously,18
NA,country have come from criminal activities?,18
Mr LYNCH,"The Government is, of course,",18
NA,anxious to assist the royal commission to what-,18
NA,ever extent possible. The question which the,18
NA,for honourable gentleman has asked relates to the,18
NA,weldiscretion of the Commissioner of Taxation and,18
NA,therefore properly is a matter for discussion with,18
NA,"poshim. I inform the honourable gentleman that,",18

Mr MILLAR,Will the Minister for Overseas,18
NA,Trade inform me as to the progress being made,18
NA,in efforts to negotiate a new international,19
NA,agreement?,19
Mr ANTHONY,Negotiations started again my,19
NA,this week in Geneva between member countries,19
NA,of the intemauonal sugar agreement. The meetwould,19
NA,ing is a continuauon of the negodations wbich,19
NA,broke down in May when the participating counrepeated,19
NA,tries thought that we would have an extension,19
NA,the previous sugar agreement negotiated in 1968 In,19
NA,but new factors were brought in relating to stock,19
NA,holdings. This produced numerous comrecommend,19
NA,plications. Figures which were,19
NA,unrealistic and imposed enormous burdens on I,19
NA,sugar producing countries to hold sugar and,19
NA,"provide the storage facilities. As a result, the",19
NA,"ference broke down. In the meantime, private",19
NA,negotiations and discussions have been taking,19
NA,place in which Australia has been playing,19
NA,major part.,19
NA,As a result of an encouraging response from,19
NA,"number of countries which saw problems, this yesterday",19
NA,conference has been reconvened. It is hoped that that,19
NA,we may be able to come to some sort of agreeter,19
NA,ment. I think this is even more imperative now,19
NA,than it was when the conference met in May be-,19
NA,cause the world price has gone down by about enable,19
NA,another £50 a ton to just over £ 100 a ton which is,19
NA,"quite ruinous for most sugar producing countries. reflection,",19
NA,"Along with most ofthe other Ministers, I shall be",19
NA,attending the last week of the conference when it,19
NA,will be getting to the crunch point of,19
NA,stock holding figures and obligations being,19
NA,imposed upon countries tofindways and means,19
NA,offinancingthese arrangements. I am hopeful,19
NA,that something positive will come out of the,19
NA,meeting.,19
NA,Australia plays a major role in this conference.,19
NA,We are the second largest exporter to the free,19
NA,market. Because of our long association with,19
NA,international commodity agreements we are,19
NA,looked to for guidance and help. We have a large,19
NA,team of competent and respected technicians,19
NA,who provide a lot of the basic information. If a,19
NA,new agreement is achieved I think a great deal,19
NA,credit will go to the AustraUan team which is,19
NA,"made up of representatives of the sugar industry,",19
NA,"the Queensland Sugar Board, CSR Ltd, and the",19
NA,"Queensland Government, as well as",19
NA,ment of Overseas Trade and the Department,19
NA,Primary Industry.,19
NA,OVERPAYMENTS OF UNEMPLOYMENT ing,19
NA,BENEFITS-UNDERSTAFFING OF,19
NA,SOCIAL SECURITY DEPARTMENT,19
NA,Mr E. G. WHITLAM-I ask the Prime Minisme,19
NA,ter a question. It concerns the answers he gave,19
NA,yesterday to questions asked by the honourable,19
NA,sugar member for Prospect and me concerning PubUc,19
NA,Service staffrailings.He will remember telling,19
NA,colleague that in no case did the PubUc Ser-,19
NA,vice Board advise him that existing staff ceilings,19
NA,result in inadequate control of payments,19
NA,made by the Department of Social Security. He,19
NA,those words almost precisely in answer,19
NA,of to my question. He then went on:,19
NA,"any case in which the Public Service Board, together",19
NA,"with members of the interdepartmental committee, did",19
NA,"an increase in staff ceilings, such a recommenda-",19
NA,introduced were tion was accepted.,19
NA,ask him whether it is a fact that the Public Ser-,19
NA,to vice Board's report which was tabled last week,19
NA,concited the processing of unemployment benefit as,19
NA,one ofthe four areas in which there had been sta-,19
NA,"ffing problems, and that only in some cases were",19
NA,a the interdepartmental committee's reports and,19
NA,recommendations to the Prime Minister ac-,19
NA,a cepted by bim. I also ask whether he noticed that,19
NA,the Minister for Social Security stated,19
NA,she had direct communication with the,19
NA,Prime Minister during the past year on the mat-,19
NA,of staff numbers in her Department and that,19
NA,she believed that further staff was necessaiy to,19
NA,her Department to give an effective and,19
NA,"efficient service. I therefore ask him: Does he, on",19
NA,now concede the accuracy of the,19
NA,Board's report and ofhis own Minister's state-,19
NA,ment? WiU adequate staff be provided to prevent,19
NA,quotas and these overpayments in future?,19
Mr MALCOLM FRASER,I think the House,19
NA,will be indebted to the honourable gentlement,19
NA,"for his question, because if honourable members",19
NA,look carefully at what Senator Guilfoyle has said,19
NA,and what I have said they will see that there is a,19
NA,complete consistency between the statements. It,19
NA,is perfectly obvious that Senator Guilfoyle was in,19
NA,touch with me about staff ceilings in her Depart-,19
NA,"ment. As a result, during last year, through",19
NA,representations made directly to the Board and,19
NA,"through me to the Board, the Board made",19
NA,recommendations for a lift of 900 in the staff ceil-,19
NA,of ings in the Department of Social Security. Yes-,19
NA,"terday I used thefigureof 850, but this morning I",19
NA,am further advised that it was 900. A very sig-,19
NA,nificant part of that number was related to the,19
NA,the Departunemployment benefit section.,19
of Mr HURFORD ,When did that happen?,19
Mr MALCOLM FRASER,I t happened dur-,19
NA,"the year, on successive occasions. As",19
NA,representations were made throughout the,19
NA,"course of the year, so decisions were made. Let",19
NA,also say that no recommendation of the,19
NA,Board in relation to these matters was rejected or,19
NA,appUed in part; the recommendations of the,19
NA,Board were applied in full. A total of 900 adfor,20
NA,"ditional staff was recommended for the Departcilities,",20
NA,"ment of Social Security, an increase of 8 percent,",20
NA,at atimewhen staff numbers in the Service as,20
NA,whole were reduced by 2 per cent. No manner,20
NA,disucssion about the question of staff ceilings will,20
NA,hide the fact that the main reasons were the,20
NA,method of payment two weeks in advance. That place soon?,20
NA,has been ended. It was ended as a result of dis-,20
NA,cussions before the Budget. The decision,20
NA,"announced in the Budget. In addition, the Minissuggested",20
NA,ter has announced a review of proceedures and,20
NA,administrative practices of the Department.,20
NA,These factors together point to the totality ofthe,20
NA,"causes of these matters. Quite clearly, the quesment",20
NA,tion of payment two weeks in advance was the,20
NA,main cause of this problem. Of course there,20
NA,staffing difficulties throughout the year. They,20
NA,"were responded to, to the extent of an 8 per cent",20
NA,increase in the staff of that Department.,20
NA,VISITS TO AUSTRALIA BY BARBARO,20
Mr ABEL, I direct a question to the Minister,20
NA,for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I direct,20
NA,attention to recent reports in the media about,20
NA,visits to Australia by members of the family,20
NA,known as Barbara. I ask the Minister whether,20
NA,there have been any applications to him for perand,20
NA,mission for Domenico Barbara or any ofhis fammajor,20
NA,ily to visit Austraha. If there have been such,20
NA,"plications, on what grounds were they made,",20
NA,with what results?,20
Mr MACKELLAR, I have seen Pess reports worthy,20
NA,and heard media statements with respect,20
NA,Domenico Barbara and two others. I remind the,20
NA,honourable member that this matter was canvasgive,20
NA,sed in the National Times in July 1974. Subhe might make.,20
NA,sequendy a question in relation to the matter was,20
NA,answered in the Senate. In November 1976 I,20
NA,dealt with an appUcation for admission to,20
NA,AustraUa of the wife of Domenico Barbara and,20
NA,their three children to visit Mr Barbara's mother,20
NA,"who, I understand, is still living in",20
NA,AustraUa. I sought advice from my Department,20
NA,"in relation to this request and, consistent with",20
NA,strong advice it had provided successive,20
NA,"ters in relation to these members of tbis family, I",20
NA,decided not to grant entry.,20
NA,COMMUNITY NEEDS:,20
NA,PSYCHO-EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS,20
Dr JF CAIRNS,Has the Minister for still,20
NA,Health seen an article in the Community Health,20
NA,Bulletin No. 5 by Dr Kenneth MitcheU in which,20
NA,Dr Mitchell suggested the formation of centres,20
NA,"development and training, with research fa-",20
NA,to identify community needs and plan,20
NA,and develop the implementation of preventive,20
NA,a psycho-educational programs? Is the Minister,20
NA,"of favourable to tbis development, and can he say",20
NA,whether it is Ukely that the formation of the kinds,20

Mr HUNT, I have seen the article to which,20
NA,was the honourable member referred. The author,20
NA,that alternative approaches have been,20
NA,developed which will assist people to identify the,20
NA,pressures imposed upon them and to discover,20
NA,those of their reactions which lead to maladjust-,20
NA,"and so on. Of course, this is quite a new",20
NA,area of consideration and one that is weU worthy,20
NA,were of support. According to my departmental,20
NA,advisers there is sufficient justification to give,20
NA,very sympathetic consideration to an appUcation,20
NA,for any funds that might be made avadable to,20
NA,the Hospitals and Health Services Commission,20
NA,"or, indeed, to the National Health and Medical",20
NA,FAMILY Research Council for a pilot project to test the,20
NA,general relevance of these techniques as an,20
NA,his alternative form of health management.,20
NA,The honourable member will be interested to,20
NA,know that the Government is interested in,20
NA,developing alternative health deUvery schemes,20
NA,alternative systems of treatment. One of the,20
NA,pohcy thrusts which we are adopting is to,20
NA,"aptest these out on a pilot basis, to monitor the",20
NA,and progress of their development and to evaluate,20
NA,"them at the conclusion of the test. Certainly, Dr",20
NA,Mitchell's suggestions in these areas are weU,20
NA,ofa pilot testing. I hope that the National,20

NA,being investigated by the pohce authorities I,20
NA,am not in a position to make a detailed statement,20
NA,"on what has occurred. I do, however, wish to",20
NA,record that the Government deplores and regrets,20

NA,SPECIAL YOUTH EMPLOYMENT,21
NA,TRAINING PROGRAM,21
Mr MORRIS, I ask the Minister for Employto,21
NA,ment and Industrial Relations: Is it a fact that,21
NA,employers applying for the training subsidy,21
NA,under the Special Youth Employment Training,21
NA,Program are not required to provide information,21
NA,concerning the position for which they are claimmany,21
NA,ing the subsidy or to give an assurance that it is,21
NA,addition to their work force? Has the Minister's,21
NA,attention been drawn to reports that some emtain,21
NA,ployers are abusing this program by sacking,21
NA,"existing employees, including non-indentured",21
NA,"apprentices, and replacing them with young perback,",21
NA,sons under the conditions of the program in,21
NA,order to gain the $63 a week subsidy? Is it not,21
NA,fact that an employer can give notice to an emBritain,21
NA,ployee and apply for the subsidy on the same,21
NA,day? Has this in fact occurred? Will the Minister,21
NA,give an assurance that applicant employers will,21
NA,berequiredto provide evidence that they are,21
NA,increasing their work force when they apply for,21
NA,the subsidy so as to protect persons currendy,21
NA,employed and to ensure that taxpayers' money is,21

Mr STREET,Fromtimetotimeallegations research,21

NA,Employment Training Program. We have taken,21
NA,sample surveys on this question to see whether,21

NA,ANTARCTICA,21
Mr CONNOLLY,Is the Minister for Foreign,21
NA,forcAffairs aware of the growing international,21
NA,interest in the resources ofthe Antarctic? What is,21
NA,the Government's attitude to the exploitation of,21
NA,the Uving resources of the Antarctic? Does the,21
NA,Government intend to hold to its claim to the,21
NA,"and, at my AustraUan Antarctic Territory?",21
NA,NA,21
NA,the growing international interest in the Antarc-,21
NA,tic resources and of the need for AustraUa and its,21
NA,Antarctic Treaty partners to respond to it. In my,21
NA,ocspeech in the House on 15 March I referred to,21
NA,"of the complex issues facing us, especiaUy",21
NA,those involving Antarcticresources.I also spoke,21
NA,of the need to define our national interests in,21
NA,terms which recognised the potential importance,21
NA,of the Antarctic to the whole of mankind.,21
NA,As regards the element of sovereignty and tide,21
NA,"which the honourable member refers, it is evi-",21
NA,dent from the Law of the Sea Conference and the,21
NA,"demands being made by a number of nations,",21
NA,based on the concept ofthe common heritage of,21
NA,"mankind, that this principle will be applied by",21
NA,in the international commumty to claims,21
NA,in made and held in the Antarctic. It is the pohcy of,21
NA,"the AustraUan Government, however, to main-",21
NA,"our sovereignty, notwithstanding those de-",21
NA,mands. It is a sovereignty whose legal basis is,21
NA,well supported by Australian activity dating,21

NA,were made to my regional director in Alice Spr-,22
NA,ings about the employment of Mr and Mrs,22

NA,of As a devotee of AM he will have noticed that yes-,22
NA,terday Mr Fancher was interviewed about the,22
NA,"$17,000 debt which Telecom alleges he owes on",22

NA,in open court last May that the telephone,22
NA,calls were made and accepted on behalf of the,22

NA,Fancher himself said on radio yesterday that one,22
NA,and of the phones was owned by the Government,22
NA,haveand had been installed so that he could accept,22
NA,"charge calls on it, why did the Minister in",22
NA,answer which appears in yesterday's Hansard,22
NA,the question I put on notice for him 3 Vi months,22
NA,"to ago refuse, on the excuse of commercial con-",22
NA,fidence to answer aU questions other than the,22

NA,the Government's responsibility for this extra-,22
NA,ordinary,22
NA,the,22
NA,incurred ostensibly by private,22

NA,which how much he could do to accommodate my,22
NA,requirements. Will he now table these appU-,22
NA,"cations and accounts, most of which, I gather,",22
NA,have already been produced by Telecom in the,22

Mr ERIC ROBINSON,I considered as much,22

NA,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN URANIUM,23
NA,DEPOSITS,23
Mr WILSON, I direct my question to the,23
NA,Minister for National Resources. I ask: Has any,23
NA,study been made of the economic benefits to,23
NA,South Australia of development of that State's,23
NA,uranium deposits? Can the Minister inform the,23
NA,House as to the employment opportunities which,23
NA,the development of uranium in that State would,23
NA,provide?,23
Mr ANTHONY,One of the exciting events,23
NA,that occurred in South AustraUa a few years,23
NA,was the discovery of uranium at Lake Frome,23
NA,Mount Painter. During the last 12 months a very,23
NA,extensive ore body which is combined with copAustraUa,23
NA,per has been discovered at Roxby Downs. It is,23
NA,quite obvious that in South AustraUa there,23
NA,potential for significant development of uranium,23
NA,mining. That is something that did interest the,23
NA,South AustraUan Government very much. It,23
NA,ried out an extensive study of the uranium industhat,23
NA,try and also of the possibility of estabUshing,23
NA,hexafluoride plant and an enrichment plant. For,23
NA,reasons which I find a bit hard to understand can,23
NA,"clearly, the Premier, Mr Dunstan, in about",23
NA,"March this year, no doubt because of the",23
NA,influence of some of the left-wing and commudevelopment,23
NA,"nist elements in that State said: 'No, we are not",23
NA,going to take any interest in uranium'.,23
NA,South AustraUa is a State which is really lacktion,23
NA,ing in resources and needs more potential and,23
NA,more job opportunities. I know that some of,23
NA,unions would certainly Uke to,23
NA,mining so that they could broaden the base of,23
NA,employment opportunities in industry in South dollar,23
NA,Australia. I feel very sorry for South Australians the,23
NA,they have such a negative Premier who,23
NA,of does not want to develop resources so as to,23
NA,the wealth and opportunity of aU people,23
NA,in South AustraUa. We have to acknowledge that,23
NA,is a very big State but its potential for develop-,23
NA,is Umited. Vast areas of it are desert and it,23
NA,is very hard to increase the population in those,23
NA,"But here was a chance, with three uranium",23
NA,the deposits which could go ahead subject to en-,23
NA,vironmental study. The Government has-,23
to be Mr HURFORD ,Wester n Mining said 1985.,23
Mr ANTHONY,Listen to the honourable,23
NA,to member from South AustraUa. No wonder he is,23
NA,sensitive. I think that the South AustraUan,23
NA,who people ought to know who is holding back,23
NA,in that State. We want to see more,23
NA,opportunities but the Premier there is all words,23
NA,"and front, instead of going ahead and increasing",23
NA,the wealth of that State. All that South AustraUa,23
NA,gets from Labor is additional imposts on indus-,23
NA,try and private enterprise which is trying to cre-,23
NA,ate jobs. Nowhere does this portray itself more,23
NA,than in the decision not to mine uranium.,23
NA,In this House last session I presented a very,23
NA,large report-a report that took two years to pre-,23
NA,pare in South AustraUa-o n the uranium indus-,23
NA,try. That report said that if Australia went ahead,23
NA,with the development of a complete uranium,23
NA,"industry there would be 10,000 jobs for people",23
NA,"during the construction stage; 5,000 people",23
NA,would have permanent jobs in the mining oper-,23
NA,"ago ations; 2,000 people would be employed in en-",23
NA,"and richment and 3,000 people would be employed",23
NA,in research and development. Of course South,23
NA,was desperately hoping that this indus-,23
NA,try would go to South Australia. That is why it,23
NA,is the spent such an enormous amount of money in,23
NA,preparing a very extensive report. This report,23
NA,stated-thi s was Mr Dunstan's report-tha t there,23
NA,"carwould be employment for 20,000 people and",23
NA,directly and indirectly half a million people,23
NA,a would benefit from the development of an,23
NA,integrated uranium industry in this country. All I,23
NA,say is that it is an ostrich attitude for people,23
NA,to bury their heads in the sand if theyreaUybe-,23
NA,lieve in the welfare of South AustraUa and the,23
NA,of opportunities in that State.,23
NA,OVERSEAS BORROWINGS,23
Mr UREN, I direct to the Treasurer a ques-,23
NA,which refers to overseas borrowings. I ask,23
NA,him whether he recaUs an answer to a question,23
NA,the asked by the honourable member for Oxley in,23
NA,get involved in which he said:,23
NA,We have made it perfectly clear . . . that the Euro-,23
NA,loan of $250m will be exceeded during the course of,23
NA,year. The Press statement which I issued some weeks ago,23
NA,made the point that we would have in mind afigureof,24
NA,around $600m or in excess of it.,24
NA,Does his answer imply that the loan ceiling,24
NA,now moved from $250m to $600m? Is it,24
NA,that these two separate loan programs total,24
NA,$850m? Was the Treasurer seeking to mislead,24
NA,the House?,24
Mr LYNCH,The Prime Minister has already,24
NA,made clear in the House today that the honourposition,24
NA,able gendeman's interest and that of some ofhis,24
NA,colleagues in the Opposition in,24
NA,tructive. I have invited the honourable gende-,24
NA,man on previous occasions to be responsible not,24
NA,only in this House but also outside of it in the,24
NA,manner in which he seeks to ask questions and,24
NA,the nature of the questions which he poses. The,24
NA,facts of this matter are perfectly clear. A number,24
NA,of Press statements have been issued. The,24
NA,honourable gendeman will recall in the first,24
NA,place the announcement of the Euro-dollar loan,24
NA,initially for $200m. As a consequence of negomission,24
NA,tiations in Europe we were in a position on verytween,24
NA,good commercial terms to increase that loan to,24
NA,$250m.,24
NA,Mr E. G. Whitlam-$200m to $250m.,24
Mr LYNCH,A n amount of $200m was,24
NA,original announcement. As a consequence of,24
NA,negotiations in Europe that was then increased,24
NA,$250m. That amount of money will be very shop stewards?,24
NA,shortly reflected in our reserves. We have,24
NA,the position regarding the balance of our prothe,24
NA,gram perfectly clear in Press statements issued,24
NA,by me on several occasions. Let me repeat tbis,24
NA,point: We have a capacity to raise at short notice,24
NA,further very substantial amounts on the world,24
NA,capital markets whether by public issues or,24
NA,f mvate placements. In addition to the $250m,24
NA,"oan presently in process, borrowings ofa further",24
NA,$600m or more are being planned.,24
Mr HAYDEN ,Tha t is a further-,24
Mr LYNCH,I f the honourable,24
NA,fact looks at the response which I gave in the,24
NA,House on 8 September he will see that,24
NA,perfecdy clear then that the Press statement,24
NA,which I had issued made the point that we would,24
NA,have in mind a figure of around $600m or in,24
NA,excess of it.,24
NA,Mr E. G. Whitlam-So that is in addition to,24
NA,the$250m?,24
Mr LYNCH,"Yes , that is quite clear. The",24
NA,Government will not hesitate to make further use,24
NA,of Australia's triple A credit standing in,24
NA,world as a triple A borrower if we consider it,24
NA,necessary to do so. I again say to the honourable,24
NA,gendeman-,24
Mr UREN ,Where is Khemlani?,24
Mr LYNCH,"Well, the honourable gende-",24
NA,has man would have more information about,24
NA,a fact Khemlani than I have. 1 recall-,24
NA,Mr E. G. Whitlam-Yo u recommended,24
NA,Fancher?,24
Mr LYNCH,The Deputy Leader of the Op-,24
NA,is as obsessive with the name Khemlani,24
NA,as the Leader of the Opposition is obsessive with,24
NA,this matter is desthe name Fancher.,24
NA,INCOMES AND WAGES,24
Mr SHORT,Is the Prime Minister aware that,24
NA,in the British Trades Union Congress recendy,24
NA,adopted by a large majority a motion calling for,24
NA,a 12-month interval between pay increases? Can,24
NA,the Prime Minister inform the House whether the,24
NA,Government has consistently argued before the,24
NA,Austrahan Conciliation and Arbitration Com-,24
NA,for a longer than three month period be-,24
NA,"national wage case hearings? Finally, does",24
NA,he have any grounds for expecting that the Aus-,24
NA,traUan Council of Trade Unions will adopt the,24
NA,same responsible attitude as has the British,24
NA,Trades Union Congress towards this matter in,24
NA,the the interests of all AustraUans?,24
NA,to Mr Charles Jones-Ar e they the Pommie,24
Mr MALCOLM FRASER,I am advised that,24
NA,Trades Union Congress in Britain has taken,24
NA,decisions in this matter and they certainly are,24
NA,well directed towards a recovery in Britain.,24
NA,Mr Charles Jones-I s not that where,24
NA,by Sinclair's Pommie shop stewards come from?,24
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The honourable,24
NA,member for Newcastle has interjected twice. His,24
NA,first interjection did not produce any laughter,24
NA,and his second interjection did not produce any,24
NA,laughter. A third interjection wUl produce a,24
NA,gendeman in reprimand from me.,24
Mr MALCOLM FRASER,The Trades,24
NA,Union Congress has taken decisions that are,24
NA,designed to assist in the recovery of the British,24
NA,economy. I believe that those decisions were,24
NA,taken in a very responsible manner. By more,24
NA,"than 7,000,000 votes to about 4,300,000 votes,",24
NA,the Congress voted for a 12 months interval be-,24
NA,tween pay increases. Clearly the Trades Union,24
NA,Congress has recognised the role that wages play,24
NA,in inflation and the role that too great an increase,24
NA,the in wages can play in preventing employment,24
NA,opportunities from arising. When I was in Britain,24
NA,in June I was advised that in the previous 12,24
NA,months real wages in that country had fallen by,24
NA,seven per cent. Against that background the,25
NA,cision obviously is a thoroughly responsible one.,25
NA,A 12 months interval obviously would give,25
NA,greater stability for firms and businesses and,25
NA,would enable them to plan ahead. The wage,25
NA,hearings that occur in AustraUa on a quarterly,25
NA,"basis very clearly are unsettUng and disturbing,",25
NA,especially as employers find it very,25
NA,know what the Conciliation and Arbitration,25
NA,Commission might award from one hearing to,25
NA,the next. The Australian CouncU of Trade,25
NA,Unions could learn a great deal from the responstruction)-Fo,25
NA,sibiUty exhibited by the British Trades Union,25
NA,Congress. I would hope very much that the same,25
NA,attitude could be shown in Australia,25
NA,same decision could be made in favour of much,25
NA,longer intesvals-preferabl y 12 months-bet -,25
NA,ween wage hearings. I have not the slightest,25
NA,doubt that that would provide much greater con-,25
NA,fidence within the AustraUan economy and,25
NA,greater security and greater employment opporMinister,25
NA,tunities for many thousands of Australians.,25
NA,There is one thing which I think the British,25
NA,union leaders have had very much in mind: Theymay proceed.,25
NA,are concerned not only for their members who,25
NA,have work but also for the unemployed in Bri-,25
NA,tain. They have taken this decision with the,25
NA,interests of the unemployed very much in mind.,25
NA,If AustraUan trade union leaders could act in the,25
NA,same way we would march much faster along the,25
NA,road to recovery.,25
NA,HEALTH INSURANCE FUNDS:,25
NA,DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF HEALTH,25
Dr CASS, I address my question to the Minis-,25
NA,ter for Health. Is there not a conflict of interest,25
NA,for the Director-General of Health because ofhis,25
NA,responsibiUty for the National Health Act under Leader,25
NA,which he controls and approves the registration,25
NA,and conduct of all pnvate health insurance,25
NA,"funds, including Medibank Private, and his",25
NA,responsibilities as Chairman of the Health,25
NA,Insurance Commission which operates,25
NA,Medibank Private? Can Medibank really oper-,25
NA,"ate independendy of the Government, as",25
NA,Minister frequently says it should and,25
NA,Australia Airlines and the Commonwealth,25
NA,"Banking Corporation do, in competition with",25
NA,"private enterprise, with this",25
NA,cised by the Director-General of Health and,25
NA,other health officials on the Commission?,25
Mr HUNT,I suppose that if we foUowed that,25
NA,logic to its ultimate the honourable gentleman,25
NA,would say that I had a conflict of interest in that,25
NA,administer the National Health Act and am,25
NA,"sponsible for its operation, whilst at the same",25
NA,detime the Health Insurance Commission is re-,25
NA,sponsible to me as the Minister. I do not accept,25
NA,the point raised by the honourable member. I,25
NA,have had no complaint from any of the health,25
NA,insurance funds which have been registered ac-,25
NA,cording to the conditions and provisions of the,25
NA,National Health Act. The honourable member,25
NA,raises a very interesting point but one that I do,25
NA,difficult to not take very seriously.,25
NA,DEPARTMENT OF CONSTRUCTION,25

NA,r the information of honourable,25
NA,members I present the annual report of the De-,25
NA,partment of Construction for the year ended 30,25

NA,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,25
NA,Mr E. G. WHITLAM (Werriwa-Leader of,25
NA,"the Opposition)- Mr Speaker, the Deputy Prime",25
NA,( Mr Anthony) has misrepresented me,25
NA,and I wish to make a personal explanation.,25
Mr SPEAKER,The Leader of the Opposition,25
NA,Mr E. G. WHITLAM-Therighthonourable,25
NA,gendeman aUeged that my interst in the Bur-,25

NA,"out that it was my Government, in September",25
NA,"1973, which joimly with the Bjelke-Petersen",25
NA,Government estabhshed the Burdekin Project,25
NA,Committee about whose report in June this year I,25
NA,had asked the Minister.,25
Mr WENTWORTH ,Mackellar)-It is re-,25
NA,ported in the Sydney Morning Herald that the,25

NA,gendeman claim to have been misrepresented?,25
Mr WENTWORTH,Yes.,25
Mr SPEAKER,Does the honourable gende-,25

Mr WENTWORTH,Yes. The Leader ofthe,25

NA,Everyone in the Australian Parliament is now an ardent,25
NA,dual leadership exerSinophile.,25
NA,"'Everyone' includes me. I am, of course, a",25
NA,Sinophile in the sense that I am a friend of the,25
NA,Chinese people but I suspect that the Leader of,25
NA,the Opposition meant something else. Certainly,25
NA,I his phrase could be misinterpreted in that way. I,25
NA,"rerebut the misrepresentation. I am, I hope, a",25
NA,friend of the Chinese people although I am not,25

NA,AMENDMENTS TO THE INDUSTRIES,26
NA,ASSISTANCE COMMISSION ACT,26
NA,Ministerial Statement,26
Mr HOWARD ,Bennelong-Minister for mission Act.,26
NA,Special Trade Negotiations)-b y leave- I make,26
NA,"this statement in the absence of my colleague,",26
NA,the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs,26
NA,"( Mr Fife), who is indisposed. As indicated by",26
NA,Prime Minister on 26 August last the Governments,26
NA,ment has had under consideration the role ofthe,26
NA,Industries Assistance Commission in current,26
NA,economic circumstances. I am now able to,26
NA,inform the House of decisions the Government,26
NA,has taken regarding proposed amendments to,26
NA,the Industries Assistance Commission Act. I,26
NA,should make it clear at the outset that the,26
NA,Government remains committed to the principle,26
NA,of independent pubhc inquiry into industry,26
NA,sistance matters by the Industries Assistance,26
NA,Commission and the Temporary Assistance,26
NA,Authority. The changes decided upon by the ensure,26
NA,Government are designed to ensure that recomthe,26
NA,mendations of the Industries Assistance,26
NA,mission are made in the light of Government section,26
NA,pohcy and that the reports of the Commission,26
NA,furnish to the Government all relevant informatained,26
NA,tion so that fully informed decisions can be made,26
NA,by the Government.,26
NA,The changes will not compromise the indepentunities,26
NA,dent role for which the Commission was estab-,26
NA,lished and are fully consistent with the often,26
NA,stated policy of the Government that it is the role existing,26
NA,of the IAC to advise and the responsibihty of,26
NA,Government to decide upon the nature and that,26
NA,levels of assistance which should be afforded,26
NA,particular industries. In its review of the role,26
NA,the IAC the Government has been concerned,26
NA,ensure that under the relevant legislation the,26
NA,Commission is able to respond fully to the,26
NA,Government's policy with respect to industry.,26
NA,particular the Government wishes to ensure,26
NA,the employment consequences of specinc recomissue,26
NA,mendations of the IAC are fully canvassed in its,26
NA,reports.,26
NA,Honourable members will be aware that in,26
NA,April 1976 the Government drew the attention,26
NA,of the Industries Assistance Commission to,26
NA,Government parties' pre-election policy on following:,26
NA,tariffs and assistance. At thattimethe Govern-,26
NA,ment requested the Commission to report ex-,26
NA,plicitly upon a number of matters in all future,26
NA,reports. In addition the Government included,26
NA,the references sent to the Commission dealing,26
NA,"with footwear, clothing and textiles specific",26
NA,"reporting requests which dealt, inter alia, with",26
NA,employment considerations. The Government,26
NA,has decided to incorporate some of the matters,26
NA,referred to in its request of April 1976 and the,26
NA,"references on footwear, clothing and textiles as",26
NA,amendments to the Industries Assistance Com-,26
NA,The amendments to the Industries Assistance,26
NA,Commission Act decided upon by the Govern-,26
NA,ment are additional to those which were,26
NA,the foreshadowed earher this year. Those amend-,26
NA,related particularly to the temporary as-,26
NA,sistance provisions of the Industries Assistance,26
NA,Commission Act. The overall purpose of the,26
NA,further amendments is to make the statement of,26
NA,Government guidelines in section 22 of the Act,26
NA,"more closely reflect Government objectives, and",26
NA,to ensure that Commission reports cover all the,26
NA,issues on which the Government wishes to have,26
NA,the advice ofthe Commission. The amendments,26
NA,asinvolving changes to the statement of Govern-,26
NA,ment guidelines in section 22 (1) of the Indus-,26
NA,tries Assistance Commission Act are aimed to,26
NA,that these guidelines reflect more closely,26
NA,Government's approach to industry pohcy.,26
NA,ComOne amendment is to insert as thefirstsub-,26
NA,in the guidelines in section 22 (1) a state-,26
NA,ment of the Government's desire to achieve sus-,26
NA,growth in the Australian economy,26
NA,through balanced development of AustraUan,26
NA,industries thereby providing increased oppor-,26
NA,for employment and mvestment.,26
NA,The Government also proposes to amend,26
NA,guideline (a) in section 22(1) of the,26
NA,the Industries Assistance Commission Act to ensure,26
NA,it expresses the Government's objective that,26
NA,any measure to achieve changes in the structure,26
NA,of of industry aimed at improving the efficiency,26
NA,to with which the community's productive,26
NA,"resources are used, are related to the capacity of",26
NA,the economy and the work force to absorb the,26
NA,In changes involved. The Government also intends,26
NA,that to amend the Act to empower the Mimster to,26
NA,supplementary guideUnes for the Com-,26
NA,"mission and, as necessary, direct the Commission",26
NA,as to the priority it should place on the guideUnes,26
NA,in the Act and on any supplementary guideUnes,26
NA,given to it fromtimetotime.A new section is to,26
NA,be added to the Act to provide that in its reports,26
NA,the the Commission will explicitly report on the,26
NA,(a) The assistance required to maintain the,26
NA,present level of activity and employment in the,26
NA,in production of the goods under reference. If a,26
NA,lower level of assistance is recommended by,26
NA,"the Commission, it shall be required to give",26
NA,the reasons why it does not recommend,27
NA,sistance required to maintain the present level,27
NA,of activity and employment;,27
NA,(b) whether in the Commission's view the,27
NA,structure of the mdustry could be improved,27
NA,"and, if so, how this should be done and the",27
NA,consequences thereof;,27
NA,"(c) the probable consequences, economic,",27
NA,social and otherwise of changing existing,27
NA,"levels of assistance, including the employment",27
NA,effects of its recommendations and their effects,27
NA,on employment in decentralised locations; and,27
NA,(d) any other matter which the Minister,27
NA,"may, fromtimetotime,request the Comfurther",27
NA,mission to report on under this section.,27
NA,Consistent with the Government's view of the the IAC.,27
NA,respective roles of the Industries Assistance,27
NA,Commission and the Government with respect,27
NA,industry assistance matters it is in the Governamendments,27
NA,ment's view important that both the Industries,27
NA,Assistance Commission and the Temporary AsTemporary,27
NA,sistance Authority be given through the Induschanges,27
NA,tries Assistpnce Commission Act a clear stateearUest,27
NA,ment of the Government's objectives and a,27
NA,indication of the matters upon which the,27
NA,Government wishes to have advice in reports,27
NA,made to it by these two bodies. The Industries,27
NA,Assistance Commission will continue to deal,27
NA,with mdustry assistance matters of an on-going,27
NA,"or longer term nature, while the Temporary",27
NA,sistance Authority will deal with industry assiston,27
NA,"ance matters of a temporary nature, deriving",27
NA,from import competition.,27
NA,I wish particularly to draw attention to the,27
NA,Government's intention which was stated in the,27
NA,"White Paper on Manufacturing Industiy, in",27
NA,these terms:,27
NA,. . . circumstances such as those experienced in recent,27
NA,times will require emphasis on short-term policies which,27
NA,able employment opportunities to be maintained until,27
NA,and sustainable growth is restored. The Government,27
NA,therefore adopt appropriate measures of temporary assistin,27
NA,ance to support industiy and,27
NA,immediately urgent problems.,27
NA,As indicated in my statement to the House,27
NA,"earher this year, the Act will continue to provide",27
NA,for the Temporary Assistance Authority to have,27
NA,regard generaUy to the same guidelines as,27
NA,to the Commission under section 22 (1) of,27
NA,"Act. However, the Government has decided to charter",27
NA,include a new provision in the Act to indicate,27
NA,that the substantial purpose of an inquiry by,27
NA,Temporary Assistance Authority is to,27
NA,the level of assistance necessary to maintain the,27
NA,current level of activity and employment in the,27
NA,production of the goods under reference for,27
NA,defined period.,27
NA,the asUnder the amendments already,27
NA,foreshadowed the length ofthe period for which,27
NA,temporaiy assistance may be accorded wdl de-,27
NA,pend on the particular circumstances. Where the,27
NA,industry has been the recipient of temporary as-,27
NA,"sistance for two ofthe past four years, a reference",27
NA,on long term assistance will be sent immediately,27
NA,to the IAC and the temporary assistance will con-,27
NA,tinue until three months after receipt of the,27
NA,IAC's report. Where the industry has not,27
NA,received temporary assistance for two of the past,27
NA,"four years, the temporary assistance wiU run for",27
NA,up to 12 months in thefirstinstance. This period,27
NA,could be extended to up to two years foUowing a,27
NA,report from either the Temporary Assist-,27
NA,ance Authority or the IAC. The provision of as-,27
NA,sistance beyond two years requires an inquiry by,27
NA,to It is the Government's intention to introduce,27
NA,to the IAC Act dealing with the,27
NA,previously foreshadowed changes relating to the,27
NA,Assistance Authority and the fresh,27
NA,I have outlined in this statement at the,27
NA,opportunity. I commend the statement to,27
NA,clear the House. I present the following paper,27
NA,Amendments to the Industries Assistance Commission,27
NA,"Act-Ministerial Statement, IS September 1977.",27
NA,Motion (by Mr Sinclair) proposed:,27
NA,That the House take note of the paper.,27
Mr YOUNG ,"Port Adelaide) (11.41)-Firsdy,",27
NA,"behalf of the Opposition I say, without debat-",27
NA,ing the pros and cons of the statement initially,27
NA,and the alterations which are put forward as a,27
NA,"sign of what may happen to the Act, that I think",27
NA,this would have been a far better way of hand-,27
NA,Ung the matter rather than the statement which,27
NA,was made by the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm,27
NA,Fraser) some weeks ago which started a run of,27
NA,enspeculation as to the future of the Industries As-,27
NA,sound sistance Commission. I say here and now-ther e,27
NA,will can be no refuting this statement-tha t the IAC,27
NA,its operations has not gone outside the charter,27
NA,to provide for the resolution of,27
NA,which has been given to it by the ParUament.,27
NA,Many accusations are made about its operations,27
NA,and about its recommendations but on no,27
NA,occasion has anyone ever put forward the view,27
NA,that the Industries Assistance Commission had,27
NA,apply done anything other than comply with the,27
NA,the charter given to it by the ParUament. That,27
NA,"always, of course, is subject to alteration",27
NA,by the ParUament as are the guideUnes. But the,27
NA,the IAC has carried out what it considers to be the,27
NA,report on directions set down in the Act.,27
NA,"At times of a rundown economy, such as we",27
NA,"a have now, there is always a move by people to",27
NA,perhaps become concerned about the impact of,27
NA,"IAC reports on industries, specifically on em-",28
NA,ployment. I know that the Prime Minister said,28
NA,his statement that perhaps the IAC was dampentiations,28
NA,ing down investment. I think that perhaps,28
NA,boot is on the other foot. People are becoming,28
NA,"sensitive, and righdy so, about the impact of IAC",28
NA,"reports on employment. But as the IAC has said,",28
NA,when talking about changes which are taking,28
NA,"place in our economy, there is a certain tyranny",28
NA,in believing that we can live with the status,28
NA,Changes will take place. It is a question of,28
NA,we deal with them and of how we allocate our,28
NA,resources.,28
NA,I suspect that the largest of our manufacturing,28
NA,industries is subject to this sort of review because,28
NA,in spite ofthe IAC recommendations which were,28
NA,to lower the protection given to the auto industry,28
NA,in AustraUa-conservativ e and Labor governwhat,28
NA,ments have moved to give that industiy greater,28
NA,protection both in the form of tariffs and procedure,28
NA,quotas-w efindtoday that that industry is in as,28
NA,much trouble as it has ever been over the last,28
NA,years. It is working below 70 per cent of capacity.,28
NA,In some areas it is not even working at the breakdifferent,28
NA,even point. So we can see that not always is this,28
NA,massive protection or the quota system,28
NA,answer to the problems presented to us by manu-,28
NA,"facturing industiy, nor is it the fact that",28
NA,"lock into manufacturing industry, about which",28
NA,"we are speaking, the size ofthe work force which",28
NA,now works in it. The drop from 28 per cent to 21,28
NA,per cent over the last 15 or 20 years is Ukely,28
NA,continue.,28
NA,The advent of the investment allowance,28
NA,led to a great deal of investment in labour-saving,28
NA,devices. So just by virtue of decisions which are,28
NA,made outside the IAC which are instruments,28
NA,"government, such as those relating to education",28
NA,"levels and so forth, one can see a change taking",28
NA,place. I compliment the IAC on the work it,28
NA,doing on the structural adjustment program and,28
NA,in analysing the changes which are taking place,28
NA,in our industries and perhaps putting up some,28
NA,ideas as to what we can expect. On this side,28
NA,House we continue to be concerned about the,28
NA,type of unemployment we have in Australia.,28
NA,have repeatedly attempted to have the Governdone.,28
NA,ment set up a joint committee of the Parliament,28
NA,to look specifically at the makeup of our,28
NA,"unemployment. Time and time again, we bethe",28
NA,"Ueve, the type of unemployment we have in cisions",28
NA,AustraUa is submerged by the cUche that perhaps,28
NA,we have unemployment simUar to that of the which,28
NA,Depression when aU the evidence shows that it,28
NA,different and wiU need a different recipe to overinstrumentaUty,28
NA,come the problem.,28
NA,I do not Uke the inference in the statement,28
NA,in made by the Minister for Special Trade Nego-,28
NA,( Mr Howard) on behalf of the Minister,28
NA,the for Business and Consumer Affairs ( Mr Fife),28
NA,that the Mmister will retain the right to give ad-,28
NA,ditional guidelines to the Industries Assistance,28
NA,"Commission or, as he said in his statement, sup-",28
NA,plementary guidelines. Not too long ago we had,28
NA,a debate in the ParUament on the right of the dis-,28
NA,quo. cretionary powers of the Minister in the oper-,28
NA,how ations of the Trade Practices Act. The Govern-,28
NA,ment was then condemnatory about the way in,28
NA,"which a Minister could, on some occasions, agree",28
NA,to certain mergers or take-overs. Here the,28
NA,suggestion is made that the Minister will be,28
NA,empowered to give supplementary guidelines to,28
NA,the Commission. That can only mean that the,28
NA,Government is not clear in its thinking about,28
NA,it wants the IAC to do. It means that,28
NA,"governments in future, until such time as that",28
NA,"is changed, will be subject to the most",28
NA,mtense lobbying from both sides of industry as to,28
NA,20 what those guidelines ought to be. It means that,28
NA,"the IAC, perhaps at every hearing, could have a",28
NA,set of guideUnes and there would be no,28
NA,overall objective look at what should be or may,28
NA,the be happening to our industries.,28
NA,we can It is suggested that the Government will,28
NA,change the Act in the way set out in the state-,28
NA,ment. We will wait and see the legislation when,28
NA,it is introduced. Over the last 18 months our ex-,28
NA,to perience is that Government legislation does not,28
NA,necessarily follow statements made by the,28
NA,Government in the House. This would be an,28
NA,exception to the rule. The rule has been for the,28
NA,"has Government to make a statement and, some",28
NA,"time later, we have received different legislation.",28
NA,But it seems to me to be in the best interests of,28
NA,of the operation of both the Government and the,28
NA,"IAC, and of industry generally, for those",28
NA,"guidelines to be set. As I said previously, the IAC",28
NA,is is not being charged with going outside its,28
NA,charter. It could be that on some occasions when,28
NA,it gives its view on what may happen to the work,28
NA,"force, we need other operatives, perhaps from",28
NA,ofthe the Department of Social Secunty and from,28
NA,"manpower sections of the Government, to look",28
NA,We at those recommendations to see what can be,28
NA,Let us recall it is the Government which makes,28
NA,"decisions, not the IAC, and government de-",28
NA,on industiy in the future should come in a,28
NA,package. If the Government makes a decision,28
NA,will have the effect of putting people out of,28
NA,is work there ought to be some other government,28
NA,which sees that those people are,28
NA,looked after. All too often in the past the IAC has,28
NA,carried the burden for the lack of government,29
NA,pohcies in manpower areas. That has not been,29
NA,the Commission's charge. That guideline could,29
NA,have been added to the charter. It has not been.,29
NA,All the statement is asking the IAC to do is to,29
NA,spell out in greater detail what it considers,29
NA,happen. Let us recall that on so many occasions,29
NA,"when the IAC has been ignored, such as in relaaU",29
NA,tion to recommendations which it has made,29
NA,"protection, and where the Government has",29
NA,"opted for greater protection, in the long term that",29
NA,has not proved to be the answer.,29
NA,We are now receiving a call from many interAustraUan,29
NA,national bodies for freer trade to help the econ-,29
NA,omies of the Western world get back on their,29
NA,feet. Totightenthe hold on industry to try to stick the tertiary,29
NA,rigidly to the status quo argues against the case industry,29
NA,"S ut forward to us by these international bodies, people.",29
NA,"-f course, we have to be concerned with the",29
NA,livelihood of the people who work in these indus-,29
NA,tries and who may be threatened by lower pro-,29
NA,tection. But it is not just a matter of the makeup,29
NA,"of the IAC recommendations, nor the Governthe",29
NA,ment acting in that one area. There should be,29
NA,co-ordinated approach to the welfare of the,29
NA,working people in terms of jobs which may be,29
NA,lost as a result of lowering protection. There,29
NA,should be no escape clause as far as industries,29
NA,are concerned in the guidelines which are sent,29
NA,the Commission. It will prove to be a very hapbody,29
NA,"hazard approach indeed if, on every occasion",29
NA,"something is referred to the IAC, with that",29
NA,reference goes a new set of guideUnes. That will,29
NA,not work and the Government is setting itself,29
NA,for aU sorts of charges as a result of the intense,29
NA,lobbying which is Ukely to go on.,29
NA,Manufacturing industry is facing a very,29
NA,"difficult period, for a variety of reasons, not",29
NA,least of which are the recommendations which,29
NA,may be made fromtimetotimeby the IAC. I bein,29
NA,Ueve that the Government has in many ways,29
NA,opted out of its real responsibUities to give us,29
NA,"co-ordinated approach to industry, manpower,",29
NA,"security, location, migration and education-a U country.",29
NA,the heads of pohcy that ought to be taken into,29
NA,account when one talks about the future Ufe of,29
NA,our industries and the future security of the,29
NA,working people. We will have a great deal more,29
NA,to say on the subject when the legislation,29
NA,introduced.,29
NA,One should not be carried away,29
NA,of the Deputy Prime Minister about the great,29
NA,future of the rnining industry and the tens of 1977.,29
NA,thousands of people who wUl be employed. He,29
NA,sounds as though he is very much in favour of Television,29
NA,dismantling aU AustraUan manufacturing indusPostal,29
NA,try. His great dream of everyone working in,29
NA,"mining industry seems to be at hand, although",29
NA,one can see from the officialfiguresthat the,29
NA,number of people who wdl work directly in the,29
NA,mining industry will be less than 2 per cent of our,29
NA,total work force. When he talks about those tens,29
NA,will of thousands of people who can go to uramum,29
NA,"mining in South AustraUa, he ought to recaU that",29
NA,"parties, including his and the Liberal Party in",29
NA,"on the South AustraUan ParUament, voted against",29
NA,uranium ntining in South AustraUa. It was not,29
NA,"just Don Dunstan and the Labor Party, it was the",29
NA,Liberal Party and the Country Party as weU. It is,29
NA,a fool's paradise and a gross misleading of die,29
NA,pubUc for anyone to beUeve that we,29
NA,could transfer thousands of people out of either,29
NA,industries or the manufacturing,29
NA,"into the mining industry, because the",29
NA,mining industry wUl not employ very many,29
NA,I think that the way in which the Government,29
NA,is handUng this matter is very messy. It is part of,29
NA,rhythm of this Government to blame some-,29
NA,a body. It is the IAC's fault because there is no,29
NA,investment. It is the ConciUation and Arbitration,29
NA,Commission's fault because wagesrise.It is the,29
NA,unions' fault because something else happened.,29
NA,Time andtimeagain the Prime Minister and,29
NA,to other Ministers blame some authority or some,29
NA,in AustraUa for the economic mess in which,29
NA,this countiy nowfindsitself. It is about time,29
NA,someone in the Government started to look at,29
NA,the Cabinet and at the decisions being made by,29
NA,"up this Government for the cause of our problems,",29
NA,because the main instrument of decision-making,29
NA,in this country is the Government. It is not the,29
NA,"IAC, it is not the Arbitration Commission, it is",29
NA,not the Chambers of Manufactures; nor is it any,29
NA,the other body. It is the Government of this country,29
NA,which is making these decisions. The messy way,29
NA,which it has handled the matter of the Indus-,29

NA,AUSTRALIA'S COAL RESOURCES,30
NA,Discussion of Matter of Public Importance,30
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Lucock)- Mr,30
NA,Speaker has received letters from both the,30
NA,honourable member for Blaxland ( Mr Keating),30
NA,and the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr,30
NA,Wentworth) proposing that definite matters of,30
NA,pubhc importance be submitted to the House for,30
NA,discussion today. As required by Standing Order,30
NA,"107 he has selected one matter, that proposed by",30
NA,"the honourable member for Blaxland, namely:",30
NA,The alarming growth of foreign equity and control in,30
NA,Australia's coal resources.,30
NA,I therefore call upon those members who apmost,30
NA,prove of the proposed discussion to rise in,30
NA,places.,30
NA,More than the number of members required,30
NA,the Standing Orders having risen in theirplacessuch,30
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER, I call the honouraction,30
NA,able member for Blaxland.,30
Mr ANTHONY , I take a point of order. Ten,30
NA,members or more must rise.,30
Mr YOUNG ,Th e number is eight. Mr Deputy,30
NA,"Speaker, he has raised a frivolous point of order.",30
NA,Throw him out.,30
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! I checked energy,30
NA,when members stood. There was the required,30
NA,number. I call the honourable member for day,30
NA,Blaxland.,30
Mr KEATING ,Blaxland) (11.55)- Mr must,30
NA,"Deputy Speaker, when in government the Austhe",30
NA,tralian Labor Party constantiy drew attendon to,30
NA,and endeavoured to do something about the empires,30
NA,increasing level of foreign investment in,30
NA,Australia's coal resources. We said then and,30
NA,"repeat now that, while there is a role for foreign",30
NA,"investment, we should do all that we can to",30
NA,ensure that Australians control and own their,30
NA,"own coal which, next to petroleum, is the world's",30
NA,most important energy source. There is litde,30
NA,doubt that coal will be the energy bridge,30
NA,tween petroleum and the alternative techWales,30
NA,nologies at the end of this century. As Kenneth,30
NA,Davidson of the Agerighdypointed out this,30
NA,"morning, governments and energy planners",30
NA,overseas are turning to more coal-fired power,30
NA,stations and downgrading the role of uranium.,30
NA,He pointed out that the Uranium Producers,30
NA,Forum has claimed that the exports of uranium,30
NA,"oxide will reach $ 1,200m a year in the 1990s,",30
NA,"he said that coal exports totalled $ 1,300m in",30
NA,"1976-77 and, on the basis of the Joint Coal",30
NA,"Board's projections, the value of coal exports",30
NA,"could be in the order of $3,000m a year by the",30
NA,year 2000. He wrote:,30
NA,And yet there seems to be no thought given to how this,30
NA,development can be organised so that the interests of,30
NA,Australia can be maximised.,30
NA,While Australians divide bitterly over the pros and cons of,30
NA,"uranium mining, the overseas giants are quietly increasing",30
NA,their investment in Australian coal.,30
NA,"They have recognised its potential, even if Australians",30
NA,have not,30
NA,"These are very prescient words by Mr Davidson,",30
NA,but it must be pointed out that the Labor Party,30
NA,has been stating the same points for years. Par-,30
NA,"ticularly during the Connor years, the Labor",30
NA,Government was castigated by the Austrahan,30
NA,Press and the mining industiy for its pohcies,30
NA,based on the belief that coal was probably the,30
NA,valuable energy resource that Australia,30
NA,their possessed. Now the doubters have become the,30
NA,"converted, but the grip on Australia's coal",30
NA,by resources by foreign companies has increased to,30
NA,an extent in the past 18 months that urgent,30
NA,"is required if the trend is to be halted, if",30
NA,not reversed.,30
NA,"We said in government, and it is even more",30
NA,"pertinent now, that Australia from now until the",30
NA,end of the century will not beridingon the,30
NA,sheep's back but in the back of the coal truck.,30
NA,"We said in government, and it is even truer",30
NA,"today, that oil companies were rapidly becoming",30
NA,companies as they diversified into all,30
NA,manner of energy resources to hedge against the,30
NA,when petroleum begins to fall as a total per-,30
NA,centage ofthe world's energy requirements. It,30
NA,be said that in view of the value of coal in,30
NA,world today all manner of companies are get-,30
NA,ting in for their cut and carving up Australia's,30
NA,coal resources to form the basis of their corporate,30
NA,in the next 30 years.,30
NA,Let us look at the acquisition of Austrahan,30
NA,"reserves in recenttimes-in fact, since the return",30
NA,to power of the Liberal and National Country,30
NA,"parties in Canberra. The following is a selection,",30
NA,"and probably not an exhaustive one, of recent",30
NA,takeovers and acquisitions of AustraUan coal,30
NA,beinterests by foreign companies. In New South,30
NA,British Petroleum Australia Ltd has,30
NA,acquired 50 per cent of Ciutha Development Pty,30
NA,Ltd. The Shell Co. of AustraUa Ltd has pur-,30
NA,chased 37 per cent of the shares of Austen and,30
NA,Butta Pty Ltd. This investment was frozen for 90,30
NA,days by the Foreign Investment Review Board,30
NA,and was released only recendy. Warkworth Min-,30
NA,ing Pty Ltd has acquired a coal lease in the,30
NA,butSingleton area. The company's shareholders are:,30
NA,"Costain Aust. Ltd, 30 per cent; H. C. Sleigh Ltd,",30
NA,"45 per cent; Mitsubishi Development Pty Ltd, 15",30
NA,per u.nt; and the AustraUan Resource Develop-,30
NA,"ment Bank Ltd, 10 per cent The AustraUan sub-",30
NA,sidiary of the Canadian Placer group has,30
NA,acquired 50 per cent of the Oakbridge Ltd mine,31
NA,at Walgan m the Lithgow region. A letter,31
NA,intent has been signed by Hartogen Explorations,31
NA,Pty Ltd with the two French companies-L,31
NA,Nichel (Austraha) Exploration Pty Ltd and,31
NA,Charbonnages de France-to take up a 50 per Government,31
NA,cent interest in the Wambo coal mine. Conzinc national,31
NA,Riotinto of AustraUa has acquired 13 per cent of fusion of industry,31
NA,Coal and Allied Industries Ltd. It is now attemptjust,31
NA,ing to buy another 42 per cent of the capital of Government,31
NA,"this company, but the Foreign Investment tiation on behalf",31
NA,Review Board has that takeover under present the Queensland,31
NA,investigation.,31
NA,In Queensland the State Government recendy,31
NA,granted Capricorn Coal Developments a coal,31
NA,tease in the German Creek area of the Bowen,31
NA,Basin. The company's shareholders are: InterUtah-th,31
NA,"continental Fuels Ltd, a European company, is",31
NA,26.6 per cent; Commercial Union (United,31
NA,"Kingdom), 26.6 per cent; the National Coal",31
NA,"Board ofthe United Kingdom,",31
NA,"Austen and Butta, 26.6 per cent. We are even let-",31
NA,ing a British Government institution into our,31
NA,reserves. SheU has acquired 16.5 per cent of,31
NA,Theiss Holdings Ltd which owns the South,31
NA,Blackwater coal mine and is a partner in Theiss,31
NA,Dampier Mitsui which also owns leases at,31
NA,"Moura, Kianga and Nebo. This was frozen by taken",31
NA,the Foreign investment Review Board. As we,31
NA,"know, nothing will come of it.",31
NA,Houston OU and Minerals of the United,31
NA,States-80 per cent-and R. W. Miller (HoldAustraUa,31
NA,ings)-2 0 pier cent-hav e received prospecting,31
NA,rights from the Queensland Government for,31
NA,Oaky Creek coal field. Esso has acquired,31
NA,cent of the HaU Creek joint venture. This leaves,31
NA,AustraUan Associated Resources with 60 per,31
NA,cent and I.O.L. Petroleum- a CRA subsidiary-,31
NA,with 15 per cent. These acquisitions are a damn-Australia's,31
NA,ing indictment of this Government's ideological,31
NA,prejudices and deUberate irresponsible shortand,31
NA,sightedness in the field of energy resource,31
NA,development in this country.,31
NA,All we have had from this Government is ad exploration,31
NA,hocery- a piecemeal of resource projects that reserves. It has,31
NA,"might, and probably will not, get off the ground,",31
NA,with no attempt to place them in the context of with,31
NA,"an overaU energy pohcy or, indeed, an overaU of",31
NA,"minerals pohcy. According to the Government, extrapolation",31
NA,an overaU energy pohcy is something that is still,31
NA,"in the process of being formulated. In the United area,",31
NA,"States, within a couple of months of President they",31
NA,"Carter's inauguration, his administration mandform",31
NA,produced a comprehensive energy,31
NA,"country that in wealth, industry and population",31
NA,far outstrips AustraUa in its complexities. Yet,31
NA,"from the Fraser Government, after almost",31
NA,years we have had only a promise of an energy,31
NA,"of poUcy, only a promise of a minerals poUcy.",31
NA,The fact of the matter is that a proper energy,31
NA,e and minerals pohcy would means that the,31
NA,would have to sit down and nego-,31
NA,tiate-not just talk-wit h powerful foreign and,31
NA,groups. The complete con-,31
NA,the proposed resources tax indicates,31
NA,how incompetent the Fraser-Anthony,31
NA,is in the area of resource nego-,31
NA,of the AustraUan people. At,31
NA,coal industry is more,31
NA,than 80 per cent foreign owned. Can any honour-,31
NA,"able member imagine the laissez-faire poUtician,",31
NA,"Mr Bjelke-Petersen, and the intimidated Fraser-",31
NA,Anthony coalition sitting down and taking on,31
NA,e company in which Australia's equity,31
NA,only 11 per cent and which thinks it can hide its,31
NA,massive profits under token gifts to the Aus-,31
NA,"traUan Opera of, I think, around a quarter of a",31
NA,20 per cent; and rnilhon doUars.,31
NA,coal The first and obvious consequence of these,31
NA,facts of government idleness and foreign com-,31
NA,pany domination is that at a time when an,31
NA,energy hungry world is in a position to Usten to,31
NA,AustraUa and AustraUa is in a position to be,31
NA,"seriously in the world's councUs, we do not",31
NA,even control the resources necessary to achieve,31
NA,this end. But that is not all. We also are not in a,31
NA,position to oversee the proper development of,31
NA,"our energy resources, not only to protect",31
NA,"from the energy crisis, but also to see",31
NA,that our major trading partners are given as,31
NA,themuch assistance as is commensurate with,31
NA,25 per Australia's domestic requirements.,31
NA,"At present, because of the foreign domination",31
NA,"of the industry, decisions on the development of",31
NA,coal are being made not in AustraUa,31
NA,"but in the board rooms of London, New York",31
NA,Tokyo. What other country in the world,31
NA,would so readUy give away such a national asset,31
NA,as at least 300 years reserves of coal without any,31
NA,strings,31
NA,attached? There is no doubt that further,31
NA,will increase the size of these,31
NA,"been calculated by experts that,",31
NA,"the development of technology, particularly",31
NA,"in situ rnining, in situ fuel coal reserves in the",31
NA,"Galilee Basin in Queensland alone, based on the",31
NA,of data from ore bores in the same,31
NA,wUl total more than the Sydney and Bowen,31
NA,basins combined. Their magnitude is such that,31
NA,a virtually Umidess source of fuel if de-,31
NA,poUcy for a development ofbecome,31
NA,should,31
NA,in situ,31
NA,sufficient to encourage the,31
NA,synthetic fuel production.,31
NA,It is vital that these areas do not faU under,31
NA,two total foreign domination and that foreign,31
NA,interests in these areas and other coal producing,32
NA,areas are required to spend money on research,32
NA,"and development technology, such as in situ",32
NA,"mining, as part ofthe agreement to allow them",32
NA,mine AustraUan coal. The Federal Opposition,32
NA,beUeves that conditions must be imposed on coal,32
NA,leases to prevent over-development of coal,32
NA,"AustraUa which would result in lower prices,",32
NA,to ensure that research and development is,32
NA,undertaken as well. State chauvinism and neglect,32
NA,by the Fraser-Anthony Government,32
NA,reponsible for the situation in the coal industry,32
NA,today.,32
NA,There are two important aspects,32
NA,whole question of resource development with,32
NA,"which I want to deal. Firsdy, I want to",32
NA,the view that AustraUa can progress only with a,32
NA,high level of direct foreign investment. WhUst in,32
NA,the past it has certainly been the catalyst for,32
NA,"development, AustraUa is now experiencing1966-",32
NA,situation in which profits and dividends payable,32
NA,abroad by companies in AustraUa represent just,32
NA,over half ofthe total after-tax company income.,32

NA,economic analysts SYNTEC. Mr Deputy 197273,32

Mr KEATING,Thi s table shows that income,32
NA,payable overseas as a percentage of company,32
NA,income grew from 23.2 per cent in 1966-67 to,32
NA,55.2 per cent in 1975-76. The apologists for,32
NA,"massive foreign investment argue that, with",32
NA,adequate plough-back of earnings by foreigners,32
NA,this trend will not exacerbate the problems of the,32
NA,current account and the balance of payments,32
NA,with repartiated dividends becoming a growing,32
NA,proportion of the invisibles. But it is precisely,32
NA,cause of the plough-back of the profits and the,32
NA,dividends normally payable abroad that were,32
NA,made in the late 1960s and early 1970s that we,32
NA,now have a situation in which dividends are so,32
NA,massive. With the world economic downturn and,32
NA,"Japanese steel production static, dividends were",32
NA,to not re-invested in new productive plant but were,32

Mr KEATING,Wha t we have seen occurring,32
NA,over a period oftimeis a massive change in the,32
NA,pattern of investment and the nature of,32
NA,repatriated dividends. The real problem for,32
NA,OVERSEAS AustraUa is the inadequacy of the Australian,32
NA,capital market. Austrahan companies of good,32
NA,Percent standing and with good prospects cannot get,32
NA,23.2 enough debt capital backing to match their,32
NA,28.8 equity interest. The AustraUan stock exchanges,32
NA,"27.4 have virtually dried up as a source of capital,",32
NA,26.4 particularly large amounts of capital. Banks and,32
NA,29.4 institutions in Australia will lend only against,32
NA,27.3,32
NA,32.5 assets and not against the potential cash flow of,32
NA,36.5 sound investments backed byfirmcontracts.,32
NA,52.7,32
NA,55.2 The monopoly in banking given to AustraUa's,32
NA,handful of private and public banks has,32
NA,produced the most conservative banking com-,32
NA,munity in the world. Entrepreneurial banking is,32
NA,foreign to these institutions. They wdl play no,32
NA,ambitious or adventuresome role in the develop-,32
NA,the ment of this young nation's massive mineral,32
NA,endowment. AustraUan companies have to sell,32
NA,off their equity to foreign corporations to get ad-,32
NA,equate capital to develop these projects. This is,32
NA,how many of the companies to which I have,32
NA,bereferred earlier in my speech have been able to,32
NA,secure such large blocks of equity in valuable,32
NA,coal projects. One wonders what the answer to,32
NA,this problem is. Perhaps it is the opening up of,32
NA,the banking Ucences in Australia,33
NA,ing competition so that some of the smug execu-,33
NA,tives in AustraUan banks wdl have to get out,33
NA,compete instead ofhaving their business given to Laborgrapes.,33
NA,them on a plate by the provisions of the Banking solutelyGovernment's,33
NA,Act. There is just no point in the Government,33
NA,talking about minimum Australian equity,33
NA,requirements when it knows damn weU that poUcies,33
NA,these hopeless institutions in AustraUa stand in invest,33
NA,the way of a growing level of AustraUan corporof thisin,33
NA,ate ownership.,33
NA,"In conclusion, the Federal Government has",33
NA,bureaucratic mechanism for the control of the,33
NA,inflow of foreign capital into AustraUan resource,33
NA,"industries, that is, the Foreign Investment",33
NA,Review Board. There are in the Treasurer's,33
NA,statement on foreign investment of 1 April 1976be,33
NA,foreign investment criteria to be appUed by the,33
NA,Board on receiving any foreign takeover pro-,33
NA,"posal. These criteria are comprehensive but, as Deputy",33
NA,the role ofthe Board is only to advise the CabiDeputy Prime,33
NA,"net, the Government can veto any takeover by a which is not Labor",33
NA,foreign company.,33
NA,The Fraser Government must inform the,33
NA,Uament and the people ofits attitude towards the,33
NA,increasing foreign domination of the,33
NA,coal industry. It is simply not good enough to say,33
NA,that the Foreign Investment Review Board,33
NA,thinks that a particular takeover is a good thing,33
NA,in the national interest or otherwise. The,33
NA,Government must state its position on the issue,33
NA,of foreign interest in coal. It must clearly,33
NA,down separate guidelines for the coal industry,33
NA,see that AustraUans ultimately have a major,33
NA,equity in this industry and are in control of it.,33
Mr ANTHONY ,Richmond-Minister for which,33
NA,National Resources) (12.9)- I have Ustened with,33
NA,disappointed interest to the speech by the,33
NA,honourable member for Blaxland ( Mr Keating).,33
NA,One wonders what motivates him to make such,33
NA,speech. No doubt he is pandering to some of his,33
NA,friends somewhere along the Une within the,33
NA,sociaUst movement. He did not reaUy deUver his,33
NA,speech with much fire and brimstone. There,33
NA,really was not muchfirein his beUy during his,33
NA,speech. It was just a prepared document which,33
NA,obviously he intends to circulate amongst some,33
NA,of his pseudo intellectual friends within the,33
NA,sociaUst movement. It was a rehashing of the sources-,33
NA,"great old catchcries about foreign investment,",33
NA,multinationals and oU compames. We have,33
NA,heard it all before. But what is so obvious about control-,33
NA,the honourable member's speech is the air,33
NA,appointment and resentment at the fact that,33
NA,something is starting to happen in the coal,33
NA,try in AustraUa.,33
to world bank Mr BAILLIEU ,Bitterness .,33
Mr ANTHONY,Bitterness? It is complete,33
NA,What did we see happen during the,33
NA,term of office? We saw ab-,33
NA,nothing. The Labor Government,33
NA,suffered the consequences of its own sociaUst,33
NA,and its complete incompetence and in-,33
NA,ability to gain the confidence of the people to,33
NA,and to develop the great coal resources,33
NA,country. Now we are seeing things hap-,33
NA,en. Perhaps the motive ofthe honourable mem-,33
NA,a er reaUy is to undermine confidence. Perhaps he,33
NA,is trying to be subversive in order to make people,33
NA,rather dubious about investing their money in,33
NA,AustraUa and to make them think that if ever,33
NA,there is another change of government there wdl,33
NA,the quick implementation of Labor's poUcy of,33
NA,nationalising the coal industiy in this countiy.,33
Mr KEATING ,Tha t is not our poticy. Mr,33
NA,"Speaker, I raise a point of order. The",33
NA,Minister is referring to a fantasy,33
NA,policy-,33
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Lucock)-,33
NA,ParOrder! The honourable member for Blaxland,33
NA,wUl resume his seat. That is not a point oforder. I,33
NA,AustraUan caU the Deputy Prime Minister.,33
Mr ANTHONY,"Thank you, Mr Deputy",33
NA,Speaker. The fantasy which the honourable,33
NA,member mentions is the current policy of the,33
NA,Labor Party which is to the effect that it gener-,33
NA,lay ously would allow some foreign ownership. But,33
NA,to that was not the pohcy that came out of the pre-,33
NA,vious AustraUan Labor Party Conference and,33
NA,that is not the pohcy which is emanating from the,33
NA,AustraUan CouncU of Trade Unions Congress,33
NA,is currently in session in Sydney. If it were,33
NA,in government the Labor Party would want com-,33
NA,plete control and ownership of Australian,33
NA,resources. It would not care how much harm it,33
NA,a did to AustraUa in the process. Why did we see,33
NA,that sordid and scandalous affair concerned with,33
NA,overseas borrowings? What was the whole mo-,33
NA,tivation of the Labor Party? It was to buy out,33
NA,foreign interests so that it could take complete,33
NA,control of AustraUan resources and put AustraUa,33
NA,into hock. It did not care how it went about it It,33
NA,did not care about going through the back door,33
NA,and back alleys to borrow money from dubious,33
NA,Mr Jacobi-Wha t is wrong with AustraUan,33
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! I point out,33
NA,to the honourable member for Hawker that the,33
NA,indushonourable member for Blaxland was heard in,33
NA,sUence.,33
Mr KEATING , I was talking sense.,34
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER, I suggest that there,34
NA,be no interjections and no comment from the,34
NA,table.,34
NA,Mr Jacobi-Le t us have another speaker.,34
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! The sell-out,34
NA,honourable member for Hawker will remain,34
NA,silent. I call the Deputy Prime Minister.,34
Mr ANTHONY,"Thank you, Mr Deputy wul not stand up-",34
NA,Speaker. I understand the sensitivity of honour-,34
NA,able members opposite. When a party has,34
NA,suffered the worst defeat ever in Australia's,34
NA,"toral history on this issue, of course there will",34
NA,some reaction.,34
Mr KEATING ,Com e on; answer the detail.,34
Mr ANTHONY,The honourable member cently,34
NA,for Blaxland talked about New South Wales.,34
NA,talked about the British Petroleum company anything.,34
NA,buying into the Ciutha company. There has,34
NA,no change in the percentage of Australian ownpoint,34
NA,ership as a result of that deal. It has been,34
NA,the Foreign Investment Review Board. What is,34
NA,he complaining about? Is he complaining,34
NA,one foreign company moving in and replacing,34
NA,another foreign company?,34
NA,Then there is the case of the Shell company,34
NA,buying into the Thiess company. That transhis seat.,34
NA,action resulted in an 8 per cent reduction in Aus-,34
NA,"traUan ownership, from 92 per cent to",34
NA,cent. Is it Australian Labor Party policy that,34
NA,would not allow even 16 per cent foreign ownerLabor,34
NA,ship? Is that what the Labor Party disagrees,34
NA,"witli? We want to know, the AustraUan",34
NA,"want to know, the people in the coal industry",34
NA,want to know and the people overseas who want,34
NA,to invest want to know what Labor Party policy,34
NA,is. The trouble with the Labor Party is that it,34
NA,not come out in the open; it will not come clean,34
NA,about it. When we came into office we laid down,34
NA,firm guidelines on foreign investment and,34
NA,takeovers. We estabUshed the Foreign InvestQueensland.,34
NA,ment Review Board which examines all these,34
NA,things. The transactions between the BP and,34
NA,Ciutha companies and the Shell and Thiess com10,34
NA,panies were approved by the Board after examments,34
NA,ination. There is no room for disagreement. It,34
NA,in the interests of those coal mining,34
NA,get more capital so that they can expand and so,34
NA,that there can be improved working conditions,34
NA,and more opportunities for the people who work,34
NA,in those mines.,34
NA,"When talking about New South Wales, why",34
NA,does the honourable member for Blaxland not,34
NA,refer to the visit to Japan just recendy by,34
NA,Premier of that State? He came back and ceeding.,34
NA,preened himself about selling out the New South,34
NA,Wales Electricity Commission mine at Newnes,34
NA,near Lithgow. He sold 49 per cent of it to the,34
NA,Japanese without even offering Australians the,34
NA,opportunity to buy into it. It is sheer hypocrisy,34
NA,for Labor Party members to talk about a foreign,34
NA,when its leaders engage in that sort of,34
NA,behaviour. They have no principles and no stan-,34
NA,dards whatsoever. All they do is become,34
NA,emotional on the foreign investment issue. They,34
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,34
Mr ANTHONY,O f course they are getting,34
NA,be upset. They hate to hear it. They should criticise,34
NA,the Premier of New South Wales. At least we in,34
NA,the Commonwealth Government do things de-,34
NA,"and in a proper, orderly manner; but the",34
NA,He New South Wales Government wUl come at,34
been Mr BRYANT ," Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a",34
NA,of order. I am finding it difficult to foUow,34
NA,through therighthonourable gendeman's argument. Can,34
NA,you clarify whether he is actually conducting an,34
NA,about auction of AustraUan assets?,34
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Lucock)-,34
NA,Order! The honourable member for Wills knows,34
NA,that that is not a point oforder. He will resume,34
Mr ANTHONY, I find quite amusing the,34
NA,it knowledge that there is such a conflict in the,34
NA,movement. When it comes to a quid it wiU,34
NA,"sell out to anybody, as we have seen in the case",34
NA,people of Mr Wran from New South Wales.,34
NA,Let us look at what is happening. When we,34
NA,came into office we said that we wanted to get,34
NA,"development going, following three years in",34
NA,wul which not one major project got under way be-,34
NA,cause of the Labor Government's doctrinaire,34
NA,policies. What have we seen? Approval has been,34
NA,given in relation to three big projects in,34
NA,Norwich Park has been cleared.,34
NA,What has happened with the Utah company,34
NA,there? Whereas previously there was only about,34
NA,"per cent AustraUan equity, under the arrange-",34
NA,that we reached with Utah on Norwich,34
NA,is Park the AustraUan equity was increased from,34
NA,projects to 10 per cent to 20 per cent.,34
Mr KEATING ,Bi g deal!,34
Mr ANTHONY,Big deal? What did the,34
NA,Labor Government do? It did absolutely noth-,34
NA,ing. It did not even get the development of the,34
NA,mine under way. We have increased the Aus-,34
NA,the traUan equity in Norwich Park and got it pro-,34
NA,We have been able to clear Hail Creek,34
NA,and we have been able to clear Nebo. An Ausmainly,35
NA,traUan company has been able to take up an,35
NA,interest there. We have been able to get the,35
NA,Gregory project under way. AU of these things,35
NA,involve enormous increases in AustraUan equity.,35
NA,The Tahmoor project in New South Wales,35
NA,now proceeding. These projects represent count-,35
NA,less millions of tons of coal. Yet during the,35
NA,of the Labor Government nothing happened.,35
NA,Let me Ulustrate the confidence which,35
NA,developed in the AustraUan coal mining indus-,35
NA,try. We all know the difficulties which Japan,35
NA,experiencing in the form of a downturn,35
NA,production and a lack of sales. Japan previously,35
NA,imported a quite high percentage of its coal,35
NA,requirements from the United States. During the,35
NA,years 1974-75 to 1976-77 Japan's imports of,35
NA,coal from the United States have dropped,35
NA,"25 million tons to 17 rnilhon tons, and AustraUan",35
NA,sales of coal to Japan over that same period,35
NA,increased from 21 million tons to 24.5 million,35
NA,tons. At atimewhen Japan has reduced its,35
NA,duction we are actually selling more coal to,35
NA,"Japan, and we will continue to seU more coal",35
NA,Japan in spite of the competition from-,35
Mr KEATING ,Tha t was thanks to Connor.,35
NA,"was Connor's work, not yours. You lot sold out,",35
NA,as usual.,35
Mr ANTHONY,What does the honourable people,35
NA,member think is happening now? He says that itself to coal conversion.,35
NA,we are getting the creait for increased sales now. volved,35
NA,The Labor Party wiU take the credit for anything.,35
NA,It will take the credit for the approval of the,35
NA,development of these mines. That development provided,35
NA,is what is making the honourable member so being appUed,35
NA,upset.,35
Mr KEATING ," I raise a point of order, Mr",35
NA,Deputy Speaker. It was bad enough that the,35
NA,"Minister should berate a former Labor Minister,",35
NA,without claiming credit for his achievements-,35
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Lucock)- to,35
NA,Order! No point of order is involved. The,35
NA,honourable member for Blaxland will cease taktrinaire,35
NA,ing points of order which he knows are not points,35
NA,of order.,35
Mr KEATING ,"WeU, it is a seU-out.",35
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! The this,35
NA,honourable member for Blaxland wUl resume,35
NA,seat.,35
Mr ANTHONY,The record of the developenterprise,35
NA,ment of the coal mining resources in this country,35
NA,is very impressive. Equity in Utah has been,35
NA,increased. There has been talk of actual Auscause,35
NA,traUan ownership in coal decreasing.,35
NA,because the statistical definition of own-,35
NA,ership is measured against actual production.,35
NA,Increased production is largely due to the efforts,35
NA,of Utah which tends to bring down AustraUan,35
NA,ownership. It is actual production taking place,35
NA,is and not a change of equity in itself.,35
NA,term Opposition members say they do not want,35
NA,foreign capital. How wUl they get into the busi-,35
NA,ness of coal conversion which will require enor-,35
NA,has mous technology and enormous funds?,35
is Mr KEATING , I have just told you-us e the,35
NA,in steel banks. Make them do something.,35
Mr ANTHONY,Does the honourable mem-,35
NA,ber want coal conversion? It wUl take an enor-,35
NA,mous amount of expertise which we do not have.,35
NA,from At the moment New South Wales-honourabl e,35
NA,members should remember that New South,35
NA,have Wales is a Labor State-Victori a and the Com-,35
NA,monwealth have come to an agreement with the,35
NA,proGerman Government and German industrialists,35
NA,to carry out a $3m feasibUity study on coal con-,35
NA,to version. If that study proves successful a $50m,35
NA,pdot plant wUl be established. If this is successful,35
NA,"we wdl need a $ 1,300m coal conversion plant for",35
NA,That which German technology and funds will be,35
NA,required. Yet the way Opposition members are,35
NA,talking today is detrimental to encouraging,35
NA,huge,35
NA,overseas to invest in these projects. The,35
NA,MiUmerran coalfield in Queensland lends,35
NA,Foreign interests are in-,35
NA,in this coal conversion.,35
NA,Why should we not have foreign investment,35
NA,it meets our equity guidelines which are,35
NA,thoroughly and properly? We,35
NA,want to see 50 per cent AustraUan ownership. If,35
NA,there is a worthwhUe project in which we cannot,35
NA,get AustraUan participation but which could go,35
NA,"ahead with foreign money, of course we would",35
NA,let it go ahead. We want to see more develop-,35
NA,"ment, more jobs and more prosperity. We want",35
NA,see more wealth for aU AustraUans. Oppo-,35
NA,sition members are so hidebound by their doc-,35
NA,philosophy that they do not care about,35
NA,the circumstances in AustraUa. They are more,35
NA,concerned with pursumg their philosophy than,35
NA,with looking after the welfare of AustraUans. We,35
NA,know from experience and the long history of,35
NA,country that AustraUa has done far better,35
NA,his than most of the other countries around the,35
NA,world. Why? It has been run on a private,35
NA,system in which people have been,35
NA,encouraged to come to this country and develop,35
NA,resources. We will continue that philosophy be-,35
NA,we know that it wUl be the most successful,35
NA,That is for this country.,35
NA,The sort of rubbish we have heard today is,36
NA,viously an exercise for some intellectuals. Those,36
NA,in the coal mining industry who need more capi-,36
NA,"tal, who want to replace obsolete equipment and",36
NA,who need to expand find that by taking in over-,36
NA,seas partners-i n some cases they have only a,36
NA,small interest as I mentioned in respect of the,36
NA,Shell Company moving into Thiess-the y can get,36
NA,new plant and equipment and make operations,36
NA,better for their workmen and coalminers. But the,36
NA,Opposidon would rather keep things retarded.,36
NA,We are making Austraha one of the leading ex-,36
NA,porters of coal in the world. We are doing that by,36
NA,"sensible, practical poUcies without any stupid",36
NA,emotionalism about foreign investment and,36
NA,foreign compames. WhUe this Government,36
NA,keeps control of the situation it will not mind,36
NA,foreign investment in the AustraUan coal mining,36
NA,industry.,36

NA,Honourable members wUl recall that on 5 May,36
NA,1977 I advised the House of certain decisions,36

NA,organisation of intelligence and security arrangeobviously,36

NA,ment's study of one of the reports of the Royal,36
NA,Commission on Intelligence and Security. One,36
NA,the most importantfindingsof the Royal Comcurity,36
NA,"missioner, Mr Justice Hope, was that",36

NA,lation to estabUsh an Office of National Assessnational,36
NA,ments. This BUl is designed to give effect to,36
NA,Government's decisions in so far as they concern,36
NA,the Office of National Assessments. The Office,36

NA,The BUl provides that fromtimeto time as cir-,36
NA,cumstances require the Office will make assess-,36

NA,taken steps to estabUsh the Office. The first,37
NA,"Director-General, Mr R. W. Furlonger, has been",37
NA,appointed by the Executive CouncU and took,37
NA,office last month. Recruitment of staff and estabresidents,37

Mr STALEY ,Chisholm-Minister for the,37
NA,Capital Territory)- I table a paper entided 'Pro-,37
NA,posals for the Constitutional Development of the,37
NA,AustraUan Capital Territory' and seek leave to,37
NA,a statement relating to the same matter.,37
NA,SPEAKER-Is leave granted? There being,37
NA,"objection, leave is granted.",37
Mr STALEY,In a pubUc statement dated 6,37
NA,October 1976 I indicated that the Government,37
NA,had decided that legislative and executive func-,37
NA,would be delegated to the AustraUan Capi-,37
NA,tal Territory Legislative Assembly. I said then,37
NA,the Government envisaged the delegation of,37
NA,for a significant portion of the Aus-,37
NA,traUan Capital Territory territorial and local,37
NA,government functions and recognised the demo-,37
NA,craticrightof Australian Capital Territory citi-,37
NA,taking,37
NA,to be involved in the making of laws and the,37
NA,of decisions which affected them. I also in-,37
NA,those,37
NA,that the Government would identify,37
NA,functions which should be reserved as the,37
NA,responsibUity of the Commonwealth,37
NA,such as functions relating to the,37
NA,national interest or the seat of government,37
NA,I indicated that the Department of the,37
NA,in close co-ordination and co-,37
NA,including operation with other,37
NA,departments,37
NA,cial and adrrunistrative anangementstheforfinan-,37
NA,proposals on,37
NA,sub-,37
NA,mission to Government and that the Govern-,37
NA,ment would ensure that the proposals would be,37
NA,up available to Australian Capital Territory,37
NA,before the next Assembly election.,37
NA,In accordance with the undertaking made in,37
NA,ofOctober 1976 the Government has now decided,37
NA,to release a proposal for the constitutional,37
NA,development of the Australian Capital Territory,38
NA,with the objective of encouraging widespread,38
NA,pubhc examination and comment on the issues,38
NA,prior to a final decision being made. The protutional,38
NA,posals are being announced now so that,38
NA,interested groups and the pubhc will have plenty,38
NA,oftimeto debate them. The issues involve matbUity,38
NA,"ters of signiiiance and complexity and, in",38
NA,ance with the best principles governing legislatAssembly,38
NA,"ive pohcy development of such a nature, it",38
NA,proper that they should be placed before the,38
NA,pubhc so that they can be adequately examined,38
NA,"and, if need be, reassessed in the Ught of",38
NA,Assembly and community views. There are now,38
NA,"over 200,000 people Uving in Canberra and it is",38
NA,reasonable to expect that they would want,38
NA,take part in a system of legislative and managethose,38
NA,ment controls affecting their daUy Uves.,38
NA,Last June I announced that the next Assembly,38
NA,"election, scheduled for September 1977, would",38
NA,be deferred. Because of the importance of,38
NA,"proposals to the people ofthe Territory, the",38
NA,of the present Assembly wUl be extended until,38
NA,not later than 31 December 1978 to aUow fuU,38
NA,pubhc debate of the proposals. The exact date,38
NA,the election wiU be announced later. I am unable,38
NA,to give afirmcommitment on the tuning of a,38
NA,final decision on any handover of powers,38
NA,functions. All the views expressed,38
NA,sidered before a final decision is made. The,38
NA,objective is to have the matter setded before,38
NA,next Assembly election. After considering,38
NA,ous reports on constitutional development in,38
NA,Australian Capital Territory the Government,38
NA,dicated last year that there should not be any,38
NA,piecemeal delegation of functions. Under the,38
NA,E iroposals now released it is envisaged that legisnational,38
NA,ative and executive responsibUity for a,38
NA,nificant portion of territorial activities wiU be,38
NA,transferred in one step to an elected Assembly.,38
NA,"The Commonwealth, however, would retain resources",38
NA,control of matters affecting the national interest,38
NA,or the seat of government interest.,38
NA,The proposals are designed to encourage,38
NA,facilitate active and effective citizen participation,38
NA,in the democratic processes of lawmaking and,38
NA,administration while at the sametimerecognisCapital,38
NA,ing the importance of the continuing role of,38
NA,Commonwealth ParUament and die Governance,38
NA,ment in maintaining the standing and importake,38
NA,tance of Canbena as the national capital and,38
NA,seat of government of Australia. The proposals,38
NA,envisage the delegation of wide pohcy and,38
NA,executive responsibUity for important functions,38
NA,"such as health, education and welfare services,",38
NA,"pubUc transport, the AustraUan Capital Territory graduaUy.",38
NA,"pohce, municipal services, the present govern-",38
NA,ment housing operations and many other ser-,38
NA,vices of government in the Territory. The consti-,38
NA,position of the Territory as the seat of,38
NA,government and national capital does not aUow,38
NA,the Commonwealth to divest itself of responsi-,38
NA,for the government of the Territory. What,38
NA,accordis proposed is a delegation of powers to an,38
NA,and not the creation of a State. Under,38
NA,is the proposals the Governor-General in CouncU,38
NA,would have a reserve power to refuse assent to,38
NA,Assembly ordinances and the ParUament would,38
NA,retain the power of disallowance of ordinances.,38
NA,In recognition of Canberra's unique position,38
NA,as the national capital the proposals indicate that,38
NA,to die Commonwealth would retain control of,38
NA,areas of administration which have a direct,38
NA,impact on the national capital role of the city. Be-,38
NA,cause of this the National Capital Development,38
NA,Commission would not be brought under,38
NA,Assembly control although procedures would be,38
NA,the devised for greater community and Assembly,38
NA,term involvement m the planning and development of,38
NA,Canberra. To preserve the present integrated,38
NA,"land management system in the Territory, all",38
NA,of land administration functions would also be,38
NA,retained by the Commonwealth. National insti-,38
NA,tutions such as the AustraUan War Memorial and,38
NA,or the Art Gallery would remain Commonwealth,38
NA,wdl be conresponsibUities.,38
NA,the The proposed allocation of responsibiUty be-,38
NA,varitween the Commonwealth and the Assembly is,38
NA,the spelt out in detail in the paper which I have,38
NA,intabled. The allocation reflects therightsand,38
NA,responsibilities of democratic participation in,38
NA,local territorial affairs and safeguards the,38
NA,interest in the seat of government and,38
NA,sigthe national capital. Therightto make demo-,38
NA,cratic decisions in territorial affairs wUl entaU re-,38
NA,sponsibUity to contribute a proper share of,38
NA,to the level of standards and services in,38
NA,Canberra. Under the proposals thefinancialar-,38
NA,rangements for Commonwealth assistance to ter-,38
NA,ritorial activities would require negotiations on a,38
NA,and regular basis between the Commonwealth and,38
NA,the elected Assembly with critical appraisal of,38
NA,expenditure levels. In recent years Australian,38
NA,Territory municipal costs and locally,38
NA,the produced revenues have been brought into bal-,38
NA,with only Umited government subvention to,38
NA,account of national capital characteristics. It,38
NA,should be expected that the Government would,38
NA,be looking to the same general processes of,38
NA,refinement in high expenditure areas here,38
NA,"including education, welfare and health. This",38
NA,refinement would be achieved responsibly and,38
NA,In accordance with the Government's federalsame,39
NA,ism pohcy it would be expected also that,39
NA,increases in levels of services and new initiatives,39
NA,would be funded from territorial sources of,39
NA,"revenue. States apply charges such as estate,",39
NA,"probate and succession duties, lottery and",39
NA,"ing taxes, stamp duties of different kinds, tobacco",39
NA,"and other licence fees and charges for services,",39
NA,registrations and the like. Such sources,39
NA,revenue would need to be considered by the them.,39
NA,Assembly. The question of tax sharing and sub-,39
NA,ventions would also be one for negotiation. I,39
NA,have already had preliminary discussions with,39
NA,all members of the existing Legislative Assembly,39
NA,and with local senators and members of the say,39
NA,House of Representatives. These discussions,39
NA,have concerned the principles of the proposed,39
NA,handover of powers and functions and during Minister:,39
NA,the period of pubhc debate I expect that,39
NA,broad outline will be filled in with all the necessraises,39
NA,ary detail. To date there has been a most pleasis,39
NA,ing degree of bipartisan support for the broad,39
NA,proposals among members of this Parliament,39
NA,and among members of the Legislative Assemthat,39
NA,bly of the AustraUan Capital Territory. There,39
NA,would be a need for members of the present,39
NA,Assembly to co-operate with the Government,39
NA,and Commonwealth departments in the prepation,39
NA,"aration oflegislation, the machinery of adminisUkely",39
NA,tration and the financial arrangements to ensure,39
NA,a smooth and efficient transfer of powers and,39
NA,functions. Departmental officers would be avaUthe,39
NA,able to assist the Assembly and provide advice,39
NA,and expertise.,39
NA,I repeat that the objective in announcing,39
NA,proposals now is to stimulate pubUc debate,39
NA,the issues and to ensure that the views and make,39
NA,opinions of all those with an interest in the,39
NA,posals can be put forward and considered in,39
NA,totaUty before final decisions are made. I present,39
NA,the following paper:,39
NA,Constitutional Development of the Australian Capital,39
NA,"Territoiy-Ministeria l Statement, 15September 1977.",39
NA,Motion (by Mr Eric Robinson) proposed:,39
NA,That the House take note of the paper.,39
Mr BRYANT ,WUls) (12.40)-We of course fore,39
NA,have had placed before us something which is,39
NA,rather more a problem than I think a solution.,39
NA,make no reflection upon the present Minister for,39
NA,the Capital Territory ( Mr Staley) in that regard.,39
NA,think that we are facing one of the more intracother,39
NA,table problems of government-th e relationship,39
NA,between local situations and national situations.,39
NA,Nobody has found a solution. Australia is in conIt,39
NA,sistent and continual trouble about it. The,39
NA,traUan Capital Territory wUl find itself in the,39
NA,situation. In Britain long-established com-,39
NA,munities are in great trouble because they want,39
NA,to have some sort of autonomy. Papua New,39
NA,Guinea faces the same difficulty. I am therefore,39
NA,"gift, prepared to agree with the objective that the",39
NA,gamMinister has outlined. I am not certain that I,39
NA,agree with the proposals. I know that he does not,39
NA,put them before us with a view that we should,39
NA,of agree with them but that we should examine,39
NA,The Minister's statement carried the optimistic,39
NA,note that we would have the matter settled.,39
NA,Surely from the AustraUan experience we would,39
NA,that anything to do with constitutions and the,39
NA,relationships between the various levels of,39
NA,government will never be settled. So I say to the,39
NA,'It is a good statement but is it about a,39
NA,the good solution?' I notice that new federaUsm,39
NA,its multifaceted head. I think the problem,39
NA,in some ways impossible of solution. But one of,39
NA,the great difficulties in facing governmental,39
NA,"questions here, and I suppose everywhere else, is",39
NA,we are more likely to concentrate on struc-,39
NA,tural rather than functional solutions. Instead of,39
NA,looking at the function which we want to per-,39
NA,"form, making that the objective ofthe consider-",39
NA,"and then producing the functions, we are",39
NA,to take existing functions and get on with,39
NA,the job offittingpeople and institutions to them.,39
NA,I think that the problem of relationships between,39
NA,AustraUan people through their government,39
NA,and ParUament here or the local people of Can-,39
NA,berra through their Assembly wdl still remain,39
NA,unresolved. So aU I ask is that whatever solutions,39
NA,"the we finally come up with, whatever laws we",39
NA,"on finally pass through this ParUament, we do not",39
NA,any inflexible rules. It is surely a lesson to,39
NA,"proall AustaUans that a written Constitution, with",39
NA,"the great difficulty of changing it, is poison to",39
NA,progress. I hope we wUl avoid that in the Aus-,39
NA,trahan Capital Territory.,39
NA,During my period as the Minister in charge of,39
NA,the AustraUan Capital Territory I hoped that we,39
NA,would evolve the situation that gradually the,39
NA,Legislative Assembly would recognise that the,39
NA,authority and opportunity that was placed be-,39
NA,it had real substance. One thing that always,39
NA,bothered me was the way in which it continually,39
NA,I demanded to know what were its powers. I sup-,39
NA,"pose, to use the vernacular, one would say: 'Your",39
NA,I powers are whatever you can get away with'. In,39
NA,"words, you produce the legislation and it",39
NA,passes through the system. The Legislative,39
NA,Assembly is in the same position as we are here.,39
NA,is always possible that the Senate or the High,39
NA,AusCourt wUl declare invaUd whatever we do and,39
NA,veto it. There are very few institutions that have,39
NA,total autonomy in the sense that the Assembly,40
NA,wanted it defined.,40
NA,I suppose that in a sense the Legislative,40
NA,Assembly was a body of my own creation. I with,40
NA,make that rather modest assumption before I litde,40
NA,leave the town. The Assembly appears never,40
NA,have appreciated the power that lay before it.,40
NA,There is an immense body of law in the,40
NA,trahan Capital Territory. I think that 150 or,40
NA,ordinances are listed which cover almost every,40
NA,area of human endeavour. I used to say to the,40
NA,Assembly-an d I presume the present Minister,40
NA,for the Capital Territory has said so too-'Yo,40
NA,make the laws about those things and if they,40
NA,transgress the national pohcies as we see them,40
NA,we have not only a right but also a duty to amendthat,40
NA,"them, send them back or veto them'. I suppose",40
NA,it is unfortunate that when we created the,40
NA,Assembly we did not give it adequate drafting,40
NA,faculties. I accept some responsibility for that.,40
NA,suppose our Government has to accept some rein,40
NA,sponsibihty. But we all have to admit that,40
NA,was difficulty in getting adequate drafting staff,40
NA,Austraha. This was one of the difficulties,40
NA,faced as a government of change. I take it that,40
NA,the present Government has faced the same,40
NA,difficulty in trying to change our decisions back,40
NA,again. I think that this is an area of expertise,40
NA,the law to which we will have to give more attenit,40
NA,tion. The Assembly always seemed to react by,40
NA,assuming that the initiative lay with the Minister,40
NA,and the Department. It is my regret that so far,40
NA,the Assembly has not shown much more energy,40
NA,and initiative in that regard. Members of the,40
NA,"Assembly, because of the parttimenature of",40
NA,"their position, lack the necessary time in which",40
NA,perform their duties. I suppose that the most siggreat,40
NA,nificant piece of legislation to flow from the,40
NA,membership of the Assembly was the projected,40
NA,law on consumer affairs introduced by Ms Kelly.,40
NA,There may have been other legislation of which,40
NA,am unaware. This brings me to the issue of the,40
NA,membership of the Assembly. I think we can,40
NA,make a case for fulltimemembership. I was,40
NA,"so sure of that three years ago, but the more I",40
NA,"of government, the more I see of the necessity",40
NA,strengthen the representative contribution,40
NA,"government of this country, the more I am conthe",40
NA,vinced that that is something we will have to,40
NA,face.,40
NA,Mr Sainsbury-It costs money.,40
Mr BRYANT,"Eveiytbing, I suppose, costs ing",40
NA,money. But money is the measure not so much of,40
NA,what the cost will be but of one's capacity,40
NA,ply facilities. The honourable member costs,40
NA,money. I do not regret that and we will keep pay-,40
NA,ing this money until the next election. In a com-,40
NA,munity such as this the cost of a legislative,40
NA,assembly is a relatively marginal one compared,40
NA,the total cost of the city. I think that cost is of,40
NA,significance. It is a question of input. By put-,40
NA,to ting in more representative people we might,40
NA,reduce the necessity for other pubhc officials.,40
NA,AusSome 18 members of the Assembly would be,40
NA,"more administering a city of some 200,000 people.",40
NA,This is nearly half the population of Tasmania.,40
NA,We should bear in mind the number of represen-,40
NA,"tatives, or misrepresentatives, we get from Tas-",40
NA,u mania. There are 15 in this Parliament as well as,40
NA,representatives in the Tasmanian Parliament,40
NA,and on all the local councils. I am not suggesting,40
NA,Tasmania does not need all these people. I,40
NA,"have come to the conclusion, again out of a great",40
NA,deal of experience first as a member and then as,40
NA,"a Minister in this Parliament, that we need many",40
NA,I more directly representative people taking a part,40
NA,effective government and government control.,40
there Mr HODGMAN ,"Min d you, we colonised Vic-",40
NA,in toria. Had it not been for Tasmania there would,40
NA,that we have been no Victoria.,40
Mr BRYANT,I think that the honourable,40
NA,member is deadright.I think there should be no,40
NA,in greater reflection on Tasmania than the fact that,40
NA,produced the present Victorian Government,40
NA,obviously by it colonisation program. The prob-,40
NA,lem in respect of Canberra is that the 18 people,40
NA,elected to the Legislative Assembly have other,40
NA,work to do. We must ask whether membership,40
NA,should be on a fulltimebasis. If we do-an d tbis,40
NA,point was made in the Minister's statement-w e,40
NA,to would exclude from government many people of,40
NA,talent and capacity to serve this city. There,40
NA,may well be a case for some part time and some,40
NA,full time members. This is a decision that could,40
NA,be made by the Assembly itself according to the,40
NA,I functions it sees it ought to carry out.,40
NA,I do not think in these circumstances that a,40
NA,membership of 18 is enough. It is time we did,40
NA,"not what we wanted to do in thefirstinstance,",40
NA,"see namely, divide the Australian Capital Territory",40
NA,to into four orfiveelectorates with three to five,40
NA,to members to be elected from each electorate on,40
NA,basis of proportional representation. Under,40
NA,such a system we might end up with an assembly,40
NA,consisting of about 20 or 30 people. I suggest that,40
NA,this area should be examined. I cannot overstress,40
NA,the importance of the representative function. I,40
NA,think that in a consideration of these matters we,40
NA,are often too bound by both precedent and exist-,40
NA,situations.,40
NA,to supOne of my other disappointments during my,40
NA,time as Mimster was that the Assembly did not,40
NA,take up the right it had as a result of the power,41
NA,given to it for its members to have an effective,41
NA,say in respect of authorities. I was disappointed,41
NA,when Mr Gordon Walsh retired from the reserved,41
NA,Assembly and from the AustraUan Capital Terriwhen,41
NA,tory MUk Authority that another member of,41
NA,Assembly did not take over chairmanship of,41
NA,Authority. I beUeve that we are faced with the,41
NA,questions of rninisterial authority in government,41
NA,and the whole system hi which we are cast. I,41
NA,think that we are a Uttle obsessed with the manthese,41
NA,aging director concept of Ministers. In fact,41
NA,"Minister is not just the managing director, he",41
NA,the whole board of directors. There should be,41
NA,more involvement in the poUtical input in relathat,41
NA,"tion to these matters, just as there is in some",41
NA,other countries. Britain is a case,41
NA,although I do not think the Ministers there act as,41
NA,teams aU thetime.Here we have a multitude,41
NA,authorities and the Legislative Assembly ought,41
NA,to be the chairman and ought to have a more,41
NA,effective say in direction.,41
NA,My view was that there should have been,41
NA,continuous evolution of local government,41
NA,Canberra along the Une of total input rather,41
NA,"an attempt to define it by ordinance and adminAssembly,",41
NA,istrativefiat.I do not agree with the deferment,41
NA,the election ofthe Legislative Assembly. I do,41
NA,think there wdl be any advantage in having the,41
NA,present members of the Legislative Assembly,41
NA,volved in these deliberations. That could be done,41
NA,by the newly elected members. I can understand,41
NA,why the Liberal members of the Legislative,41
NA,Assembly would not want the election to be held.,41
NA,I presume that they would have visited upon,41
NA,them the wrath of the citizens of this area bepartment,41
NA,cause of the disadvantages imposed on them,41
NA,this Government-althoug h not always by the,41
NA,"present Minister for the Capital Territory,",41
NA,course.,41
Mr HODGMAN ,Your Mr VaUee is a great help,41
NA,to the Liberal Party.,41
Mr SPEAKER,Order! I point out that if the,41
NA,honourable member for Denison wishes to,41
NA,"ject, and that is out of order, he should return",41
NA,his seat. He is out of order on two counts in,41
NA,jecting from some other honourable member's,41
NA,seat.,41
Mr BRYANT,I am glad that there is such a,41
NA,large audience here at present. I point out,41
NA,honourable members the difficulty in which the,41
NA,"Governmentfindsitself, or the Minister",41
NA,"himself, in attempting to define the areas which",41
NA,ought to be regarded as national responsibilities,41
NA,and those which ought to be local responsibUito,41
NA,"ties. Most of us would agree, although membersation",41
NA,"of the Legislative Assembly may not, that control",41
NA,of land ought to be reserved to the national,41
NA,body; but why should the matter of hoUdays be,41
NA,to the national body? I remember that,41
NA,I was the responsible Minister I granted a,41
NA,the number of holidays in the AustraUan Capital,41
NA,the Territory which brought down on my innocent,41
NA,"head the wrath of the local employers. However,",41
NA,I think that the matter of holidays ought to be a,41
NA,local affair. But what is the difference between,41
NA,things? Why are unit tides and long service,41
NA,the leave reserved to the national body when other,41
NA,is things are to be transferred? I put these things,41
NA,"forward for consideration, not with a suggestion",41
NA,they be decided one way or the other but to,41
NA,show the very great difficulty we face in trying to,41
NA,"in point, make a decision about them.",41
NA,of Is the role of this ParUament adequate? The,41
NA,"Governor-General in CouncU, that is the Minis-",41
NA,"try or the Executive CouncU, wUl be able to veto",41
NA,"decisions. The reasons wUl be tabled here, but",41
NA,wUl we then be able to disallow the veto? I hope,41
NA,a that we wUl examine the legislation in that,41
NA,in respect when it comes forward. As for the,41
NA,than replacement of members of the Legislative,41
NA,I think we should use the Tasmanian,41
NA,of system and not have nomination by the parties. I,41
NA,not think that both the system that we use for the,41
NA,Senate and the one that is to be used for the,41
NA,inLegislative Assembly constitute a denial of the,41
NA,representative principle. I do not think people,41
NA,ought to be able to sit in representative bodies,41
NA,unless they are actuaUy direct representatives.,41
NA,I am not too sure that the abohtion ofthe De-,41
NA,of the Capital Territory is wise. My ex-,41
NA,by perience after examining government bodies,41
NA,throughout AustraUa as a member of the House,41
NA,of of Representatives Standing Committee on,41
NA,Environment and Conservation is that we need,41
NA,some overall authority or functional unit which,41
NA,can bring everything into focus. One of the great,41
NA,disabUities of nearly every area of Australia is,41
NA,the dispersal of functions through authorities,41
NA,interwhich do not need to co-operate with one,41
NA,"to another. For instance, I disagreed with the trans-",41
NA,interfer of the Commonwealth car service to the,41
NA,Department of Administrative Services-no t be-,41
NA,cause I have any grudge against that Depart-,41
NA,ment but because I felt that this was a departure,41
NA,from the principle that we ought to be trying to,41

NA,and areas ought to be integrated as nearly as,41
NA,finds possible into some co-operating force.,41
NA,In the city of Canberra we have an opportunity,41
NA,create an administrative and executive oper-,41
NA,which will be an example to the rest of,41
NA,Australia. We only have to look at the manageyears,42
NA,ment of Melbourne and Sydney to see how Territory.,42
NA,difficult it is to get any sense out ofthe whole sys-,42
NA,tem. I think that that transfer was a backward,42
NA,step. I think that the dispersal ofthe Department,42
NA,ofthe Capital Territory will be a backward step.,42
Mr STALEY ,Bu t in a way it will bring things,42

Mr BRYANT,Som e of the responsibUities,42
NA,wUl be dispersed to some other Mimster who,42
NA,not bother much about them because he wUl simply,42
NA,have 45 other things to do. I have several fears,42
NA,which I would like to express. One is that,42
NA,financing provisions will be such that they willand,42
NA,start to cause atrophy in this city. The citizens,42
NA,will have a much heavier burden to bear in,42
NA,to keep up the standard ofthe Australian Capital,42
NA,Territory. I foresee the deadening hand of the,42
NA,Treasurer coming into it. On,42
NA,think that part time membership ofthe Legislat-,42
NA,ive Assembly will mean that its members,42
NA,have enoughtimeto apply themselves to the job.,42
NA,The Minister responsible willfindthe Legislative,42
NA,Assembly on the edge of his duties and therefore,42
NA,we willfindthat many things wUl flow back and,42
NA,the place will become just another bureaucratic,42
NA,enclave.,42
NA,The Minister having brought the matter here utes,42
NA,"and having initiated discussion, the time",42
NA,come for us to try to get the community to think,42
NA,Uttle more constructively about it. I hope that,42
NA,some of the thoughts expressed here and in,42
NA,other place about the AustraUan Capital Terripare,42
NA,tory can be put out in such a way that the citizens,42
NA,wUl start to think a Uttle more constructively,42
NA,about this matter. If we are not careful we will,42
NA,end up in a situation of confrontation.,42
NA,"people wUl be for it and others will be against it,",42
NA,and somebody wUl have to make a decision to,42
NA,"which, with the hindsight of history, probably",42
NA,wUl be the wrong decision.,42

NA,tution Ifindthat section 125 refers to the estabassure,42
NA,Ushment of a capital territory no closer than,42
NA,miles from Sydney. If one looks back to our,42
NA,history onefindsthat the only reason the AusGovernment,42
NA,traUan Capital Territory was established was,42
NA,satisfy the jealousies which existed between Vicpiece.,42

NA,this Territory would be established to meet the,42
NA,needs or rather whims of those 2 States. We havetralians,42

NA,and today we have aflourishingcity and,42
NA,Previously in this House I have proposed the,42
NA,concept of changing section 125 of the Consti-,42
NA,tution in order that the AustraUan Capital Terri-,42
NA,tory might be placed back in New South Wales. I,42
NA,"have a veryfirmview about tbis, a view which",42

NA,"State, namely, that there is no need whatsoever",42
NA,to keep up a duplication of the bureaucracy and,42
NA,will the forms of government that are necessary,42

NA,wrong?' New South Wales is the only State that,42
NA,is opposed to the idea; the rest are totaUy in,42
NA,"the other hand, I favour of it.",42
NA,wdl not We talk about cutting down government,42
NA,"expenditure, and I believe that we can start right",42
NA,here in Canberra. There is absolutely no need for,42

Mr NIXON,I thank the House. It is also sigWales,44
NA,nificant that our provision for new projects,44
NA,year is the first allocation for new works under,44
NA,the Urban Pubhc Transport Agreement since the,44
NA,1974 budget. Although $5m is a relatively minor,44
NA,amount I believe that its allocation is a clear,44
NA,indication of the commitment this Government,44
NA,has to ensure urban public transport services,44
NA,"upgraded. However, the apportionment of the",44
NA,$5m for new projects was not an easy task.,44
NA,"Consequendy, I sought from my State colleagues",44
NA,their views on possible allocations. In all cases,44
NA,there was an overwhelming priority given to the,44
NA,acquisition of rolling stock. I am in agreement Hansard.,44
NA,with this ranking and I therefore decided to allo-,44
NA,cate all funds towards rolling stock,44
NA,commitments.,44
NA,In determining each State's allocation I have,44

Mr NIXON,I thank the House. The remain-,45

NA,to meet cost increases. As honourable members,45
NA,will appreciate these funds are not payable in,45
NA,relation to particular projects until cost,45
NA,are justified in accordance with clause,45
NA,the Agreement. Consequently it is not possible,45
NA,this stage to advise Parliament of the ultimate al-,45
NA,location of these funds. Whilst many projects are,45
NA,yet to befinishedwe are already seeing the,45
NA,benefits from those that have been completed.,45
NA,"a number of cities, for example, it is now not",45
NA,usual to see people allow older rolling stock to,45
NA,"pass so that they can catch the new bus, train",45
NA,tram that is following. This is a clear indication,45
NA,of the value the community attaches to the,45
NA,improvements in comfort and ride provided,45
NA,the rolling stock funded under the Urban,45
NA,Transport Agreement.,45
NA,Substantial increases in ridership have States,45
NA,"occurred, for instance, since the Christie Downs vancesfor",45
NA,RaUway was opened. Patronage at the Christie period ending,45
NA,Downs station is already exceeding 1975 predic-,45
NA,tions by almost 30 per cent. Particularly pleasingprovided,45
NA,is the fact that over 50 per cent of users prethe National,45
NA,viously travelled to central Adelaide by car. The Pending,45
NA,"success of this project is a clear indication that House,",45
NA,weU planned pubhc transport improvements can to,45
NA,increase patronage particularly by attracting premonths,45
NA,vious car users. SimUar results have also been proposedof,45
NA,achieved by the interchanges constructed in Brisnow proposed wUl subsume,45
NA,bane and Perth. At Petrie and Enoggera railway,45
NA,"stations, for example, since completion",45
NA,interchange facUities increased ticket sales,45
NA,almost 70 per cent and over 50 per cent respecfor,45
NA,tively have been experienced. At Innaloo about,45
NA,one third of aU park-and-ride patrons previously,45
NA,did not use pubhc transport. The success of this,45
NA,interchange is demonstrated by the recent agreean,45
NA,ment between the Western AustraUan Minister Each,45
NA,and myself that a second car park wUl be,45
NA,constructed.,45

NA,amount equivalent in real terms to 1977-78.,45
NA,"State's share of the indexed total grant wUl,",45

NA,This adjustment may be varied on account,46

NA,aspect are to be finalised in discussion with the,46
NA,States. These discussions wUl also be useful of,46
NA,course in helping to avoid any misunderstandin,46
NA,ings about the indexation arrangements. Generport,46
NA,ally I would not anticipate any drastic alterations,46
NA,to the adjustments derived by use of the price,46
NA,deflator proposed and the overall effect of the,46

NA,must also point out to the House that the,46
NA,proposed indexation arrangements wUl provide,46
NA,a guaranteed nunimum. As the States already,46
NA,know through advice from the Prime Minister,46
NA,"( Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Commonwealth's",46
NA,commitment is to provide funds at least,46
NA,equivalent in real terms to the 1977-78 allouse,46

NA,This is a very substantial effort on the part,46
NA,Government and it signifies our determination,46
NA,stay with our proper responsibUities with regard,46
NA,to Australia's road network. It is a particularly,46
NA,significant effort on our part when considered,46
NA,the Ught of overaU budgetary problems. The to,46
NA,Government recognises the importance,46
NA,adequate transport networks for the economic,46
NA,weU-being of AustraUa and I should comment,46
NA,passing that in addition to our funding for,46
NA,purposes we also have substantial commitments,46
NA,in relation to other transport modes which we,46
NA,discharging responsibly. Honourable members,46
NA,wUl probably be aware that at the February,46
NA,meeting of the AustraUan Transport Advisory,46
NA,CouncU I announced that the Government,46
NA,intended to make $475m avaUable for road,46
NA,grants in 1977-78. At thattimeI also announced,46
NA,a number of significant pohcy initiatives on the,46
NA,part of the Commonwealth Government with prove,46
NA,regard to the areas in which we propose to,46
NA,"centrate ourfinancialassistance. In particular,",46
NA,announced that the Commonwealth Governmore,46
NA,ment intended to ensure that its funds were,46
NA,avaUable for use by local authorities in such,46
NA,move-way and to such an extent that the Common-,46
NA,Government could not in the future be,46
NA,held out as responsible for inadequate road,46
NA,at this level. It was also made clear in the,46
NA,aUocations which I proposed to the AustraUan,46
NA,Transport Advisory CouncU that we were,46
NA,of committed to continue funding for the national,46
NA,network and the main rural arterial,46
NA,"innetwork, which is of course a key part of the",46
NA,inter-regional and inter-urban transport system.,46
NA,This re-direction of Commonwealth effort was,46
NA,part based on recognition ofthe fact that sup-,46
NA,for urban arterial roads in the legislation,46
NA,"just ended had, in our view, taken an excessive",46
NA,part of the total avaUable Commonwealth funds.,46
NA,"In fact, we informed the State Governments that",46
NA,we were not prepared to continue providing a,46
NA,major part of funds for the construction of urban,46
NA,freeways at the expense of other road works. We,46
NA,are not abandoning urban transport as is eviden-,46
NA,ced by our decision to provide a further $5lm to,46
NA,the States under the urban transport agreement,46
NA,in 1977-78. We recognise that in the cities a,46
NA,"balanced approach to transport, including the",46
NA,"of pubhc transport, is essential and we are",46
NA,pursuing vigorously with the State governments,46
NA,problems which are faced in developing and,46
NA,improving these systems for the future. Honour-,46
NA,able members should also be aware that since,46
NA,our return to office we have held detaUed and ex-,46
NA,abovetended discussions through the Australian,46
NA,Advisory Council with the object of,46
NA,of theeliminating unnecessary complexity and,46
NA,to intrusion on our part in the affairs of State,46
NA,governments in relation to transport matters.,46
NA,"This is, of course, part of our wider approach in",46
NA,inthe development of a federaUsm pohcy designed,46
NA,avoid the many areas of friction which charac-,46
NA,of terised our predecessor's arrangements.,46
NA,in I should comment that the allocations for,46
NA,"roads1977-78 which are proposed in this BUl, also",46
NA,"reflect to an extent, requests from State Ministers",46
NA,arefor changes to allocations which I proposed to,46
NA,them at the AustraUan Transport Advisory,46
NA,CouncU. The allocations which I am proposing in,46
NA,the schedules to the BUl to cover 1978-79 and,46
NA,1979-80 wUl maintain the new thrust of Com-,46
NA,monwealth funding to which I have already,46
NA,"referred. However, the legislation wUl continue",46
NA,to contain provisions which wUl enable me to ap-,46
NA,requests from the States for transfers be-,46
NA,"con-tween road categories, to meet for example,",46
NA,I changes in State road works priorities. Further-,46
NA,I should make it quite clear to the House,46
NA,madethat the BUl does not aUocate the additional,46
NA,a indexation funds for 1978-79 and 1979-80 to,46
NA,particular road categories. Obviously the Parlianote,47
NA,ment will in due course be asked to appropriate,47
NA,these extra funds and their allocation to the,47
NA,ous road categories within each State.,47
NA,I would now like to draw the attention of,47
NA,honourable members to the main features of this,47
NA,"Bill. Firsdy, in the interest of simplified adminisline",47
NA,tration the legislation is being presented as,47
NA,Bill instead of two separate Acts similar to those,47
NA,which were in force up to 30 June last. State Min-substituting,47
NA,isters have welcomed this feature. In addition,47
NA,there will in future be no difference in the,47
NA,cial administration for national roads as,47
NA,pared with other road categories since pro rata,47
NA,advances will be made to the-States for all road,47
NA,categories on a monthly basis. The present separusing,47
NA,atefinancialarrangements in respect of national,47
NA,highways will be discontinued. The Bill also,47
NA,vides that the only Ministers with administrative,47
NA,responsibilities will be the Minister for Transport,47
NA,and the Treasurer.,47
NA,Of particular interest is our decision that the,47
NA,new legislation will continue the change Federal-State,47
NA,introduced recendy whereby payroll tax may be,47
NA,included as an eligible item of expenditure both,47
NA,from the Commonwealth grants and as a complarming,47
NA,ponent of matching State quotas. This is consistcapable,47
NA,ent with the approach adopted in relation to,47
NA,Commonwealth grants in some other programs.,47
NA,The road categories which are specified in,47
NA,legislation are as follows: National highways,47
NA,construction; national highways maintenance;,47
NA,national commerce road construction; rural,47
NA,arterial road construction; rural,47
NA,struction and maintenance; urban arterial road,47
NA,construction; urban local road construction; and,47
NA,Minor Traffic Engineering and Road Safety,47
NA,Improvements Program.,47
NA,Honourable members will be aware that these,47
NA,categories are similar to those of the previous,47
NA,"legislation. There is, however, no longer a separstandard",47
NA,ate reference in the legislation to beef roads,47
NA,developmental roads although beef roads will,47
NA,continue to be eligible for assistance. The,47
NA,category export and major commercial roads has,47
NA,been replaced by the category national combackground,47
NA,merce roads. The legislation will provide for,47
NA,State quotas of matching expenditure. The States,47
NA,are required to find from their own resources,47
NA,minimum amount of roads expenditure in order,47
NA,to qualify for the Commonwealth funds. I wish to,47
NA,stress that this provides only a base below whichtions,47
NA,State roads expenditure cannot fall. It does not,47
NA,any way limit total State road expenditure.,47
NA,fact honourable members should be aware that,47
NA,in recent years New South Wales has heavily roads,47
NA,exceeded its State quota. It is also important to,47
NA,that under this legislation the States remain,47
NA,free to allocate their own funds to roads in ac-,47
NA,varicordance with their own priorities. The legis-,47
NA,lation also provides for a minimum quota each,47
NA,year for all States combined of $418.8m. It is,47
NA,intended to index the individual State quotas in,47
NA,with any increases in the Commonwealth,47
NA,one grant. The Commonwealth sees the road funds,47
NA,that it provides as supplementing rather than,47
NA,"for State finance. On this basis, we",47
NA,consider it reasonable that increases in the Com-,47
NA,finan-monwealth grant ought to be matched by,47
NA,comincreases in the matching State quotas.,47
NA,The legislation continues to provide for the,47
NA,annual submission of programs'to be carried out,47
NA,Commonwealth funds for the approval of,47
NA,the Commonwealth Minister. In the case of local,47
NA,proroads a program of allocations for road works,47
NA,can be submitted as an alternative to a program,47
NA,of projects. On the basis of discussions and,47
NA,agreement with State Ministers I have included,47
NA,in the Bill provision for the establishment ofjoint,47
NA,planning committees as a possible,47
NA,alternative to the system of program approval.,47
NA,Initially this provision can be used to establish,47
NA,committees for national roads but is,47
NA,of being used for other road categories if,47
NA,desired and agreed. It will be a matter for agree-,47
NA,ment between individual State Ministers and the,47
NA,the Commonwealth Minister as to whether planning,47
NA,committees are to be adopted at all. In each case,47
NA,the conditions under which the alternative ap-,47
NA,proach is adopted will be a matter for agreement,47
NA,local road conbetween Ministers.,47
NA,"This legislation, unlike the previous legislation",47
NA,"brought in by our predecessors, will not require",47
NA,the submission of all programs for urban,47
NA,arterials no matter how they are funded. The,47
NA,final feature of this Bill which I should draw to,47
NA,the attention of the House is the inclusion of a,47
NA,information clause. This information,47
NA,or clause is intended to enable the collection of,47
NA,information consistent with Commonwealth pur-,47
NA,poses under the legislation. It does not permit,47
NA,wholesale intrusion into State affairs. Against this,47
NA,honourable members should note it,47
NA,is my intention to continue to work with State,47
NA,governments on a co-operative and federal basis.,47
NA,a The explanatory notes I have circulated,47
NA,describe the main feature of the Bill and I would,47
NA,not therefore propose to deal with individual sec-,47
NA,in any detail. The important points for,47
NA,in members to note are that Parts II and III of the,47
NA,In Bill contain the clauses necessary for program,47
NA,approval and payment of grants for nauonal,47
NA,and other roads respectively. Part I sets out,47
NA,the usual definitions. Part IV specifies the general,47
NA,"administrative machinery, appropriation",48
NA,"clauses, provisions for reports, informadon and",48
NA,audit certification and so on. The schedules pro-,48
NA,vide details of allocations to individual road,48
NA,categories within each State for each of the three,48
NA,years based on $475m. Quota details are also,48
NA,included in the schedules. I commend the Bill to,48
NA,the House.,48

NA,in the States to finance wholly or partially the,48
NA,Second Reading construction of approved priority school facUi-,48

NA,The first part of this modernisation program,49
NA,will commence next year by upgrading the existwithin,49
NA,ing system with a limited form of computer,49
NA,trol. The second part of the program is the,49
NA,tion of a new electronic switching system for use,49
NA,"from about 1980. To this end,",49
NA,ders for suitable equipment closed in July 1975;,49
NA,seven tenders were received.,49
NA,In mid 1976 Telecom announced that it had,49
NA,narrowed the equipment selection down to two,49
NA,"tenders, one from L. M. Ericsson (Australia)",49
NA,Ltd for an AXE system and the other from STC,49
NA,(Australia) Pty Ltd for its IOC equipment. Some,49
NA,"20,000 man-hours of technical evaluation of",49
NA,two systems resulted in the Australian Telecomequipment.,49
NA,munications Commission recommending the,49
NA,AXE system offered by L. M. Ericsson,49
NA,(AustraUa) Pty Ltd as the most suitable system,49
NA,for introduction into the AustraUan network in,49
NA,the 1980s. This system capitalises on recent adcontinue,49
NA,vances in computer and electronics technologies.,49
NA,"It wiU be cheaper to buy, to install and to",49
NA,tain than if Telecom continued with the present,49
NA,system. It wUl be an important factor in contain-,49
NA,ing cost increases and thus prices to the user in,49
NA,the years ahead.,49
NA,Savings over the first ten year period are,49
NA,estimated to be in excess of $100m at current,49
NA,"prices. In addition, the new equipment wUl en-",49
NA,able a range of additional facUities to be,49
NA,introduced progressively. The contract with L.,49
NA,M. Ericsson will require a high proportion of,49
NA,"will AustraUan manufacture, reaching at least 80 per",49
NA,cent as volume increases. The contract wiU also,49
NA,provide for manufacture under Ucence.,49
NA,The introduction of the stored program con-,49
NA,trol equipment and its adaptation to work with,49
NA,the AustraUan network wUl be a substantial en-,49
NA,gineering undertaking for both Telecom and the,49
NA,In adopting an SPC local exchange,49
NA,system Australia is in line with the general trend,49
NA,around the world. While the equipment wUl,49
NA,"less staff to install and maintain, the",49
NA,growth in telecommunication services is,49
NA,curstrong and Telecom's technical labour force,49
NA,4.5 milUon should continue to grow.,49
NA,In chosing between the two main competitive,49
NA,systems the overall employment consequences in,49
NA,telecommumcations industry were of concern,49
NA,to the Government. Both STC and L. M. Ericsson,49
NA,established facUities for switching equip-,49
NA,to ment production in AustraUa. The Government,49
NA,is convinced that while it may be,49
NA,necessary for some readjustment in staffing,49
NA,levels between STC and L. M. Ericsson there wUl,49
NA,be no overall adverse impact on employment,49
NA,the industry as a result of the decision. In,49
NA,"conterms of total factory production employment,",49
NA,adopcompany staff are more dependent on overaU,49
NA,Telecom orders than on the choice of a particular,49
NA,world-wide tennew switching system.,49
NA,In the period 1977 to 1985 orders for tele-,49
NA,phone switching equipment which include the,49
NA,STC 10C trunk equipment and the first deUveries,49
NA,of SPC local equipment are expected to be worth,49
NA,Pty about $700m at current prices. STC manufac-,49
NA,tures crossbar equipment under Ucence and is the,49
NA,sole 10C trunk supplier. L. M. Ericsson on the,49
NA,the other hand is the prime suppUer for crossbar,49
NA,On this basis therefore even with the SPC local,49
NA,"equipment being awarded to L. M. Ericsson,",49
NA,total switching equipment orders are expected to,49
NA,at a comparable level until at least the,49
NA,mid 1980s. Beyond 1985 it can be expected that,49
NA,mainSPC local switching equipment wUl be made,49
NA,under Ucence by a second manufacturer. STC are,49
NA,already manufacturing electronic trunk switch-,50
NA,ing equipment and could quite possibly be,50
NA,able Ucensee of the local SPC local system.,50
NA,The Commission beUeves that the introduc-,50

NA,cost savings and itsflexibditywUl give customers,50
NA,improved services. The Commission views the,50
NA,future with optimism. Demand seems assured.,50
NA,There is a sound network and a well quaUfied,50
NA,staff. Promising new technology holds an advanthat,50
NA,tageous prospect of additional services together,50
NA,with the important cost features. The new equipthat,50

NA,not necessarily so. The Government is in charge,50
NA,of the business of the House. The Minister can,50

NA,But a motion could be moved now that the,50
NA,House take note of the paper and the honourable,50

Mr WENTWORTH , I understand that the motion,50

Mr ERIC ROBINSON,If it is the wish ofthe,50
NA,a suitHouse and if the honourable member for New-,50
NA,"casde ( Mr Charles Jones) is agreeable, I move:",50
NA,That the House take note of the paper.,50
Mr CHARLES JONES ,Newcastle),50
NA,(2.50)- I do not know what is to happen at this,50
NA,stage now that the Minister for Post and Tele-,50
NA,communications ( Mr Eric Robinson) has moved,50
NA,the House take note of the paper. The usual,50
NA,procedure once that motion has been moved is,50
NA,the matter is placed on the Notice Paper. But,50
NA,as the honourable member for MackeUar ( Mr,50
NA,the Wentworth) and probably the honourable mem-,50
NA,ber for Adelaide ( Mr Hurford) are to speak on,50
NA,"this matter, I do not know whether we are going",50
NA,to have a full scale debate on it.,50
NA,We on this side of the House received the ap-,50
NA,propriate two hours notice that the statement,50
NA,was going to be made. I do not think any honour-,50
NA,able member would expect us at tbis stage to,50
NA,the make a decision as to whether the Opposition,50
NA,"of wUl support the proposal, oppose it or remain",50
NA,"neutral to it, bearing in mind that the Minister's",50
NA,"advisers have spent some 20,000 man hours on",50
NA,the technical evaluation of the two systems. We,50
NA,on this side of the House have had a Utde over,50
NA,"two hours in which to look at the paper. In fact,",50
NA,the reason why I was late coming into the House,50
NA,for the Minister's presentation of his statement,50
NA,was that our Committee was looking at the paper,50
NA,for with two of the advisers which the Minister pro-,50
NA,vided to confer with us. So we have just reached,50
NA,the stage of getting a preUminary rundown of,50
NA,the statement is all about and it is a little,50
NA,difficult to indicate where we are going.,50
NA,From reading the Minister's statement and,50
NA,It from the hour I had with his two technical,50
NA,"this morning, the system that has been",50
NA,stateselected appears- I emphasise that word,50
NA,'appears'-t o be a more effective system than the,50
NA,alternative system which was put up by STC,50
NA,(Australia) Pty Ltd. Problems are associated,50
NA,with this proposal. Men's employment is in-,50
NA,volved. The appropriate telecommunications,50
NA,"unions are concerned for, as the Minister has cor-",50
NA,"rectly said, this new equipment wiU be easier to",50
NA,install and easier to maintain also and in the long,50
NA,term it wUl affect a little thing called employ-,50
NA,"ment. So, as far as the men are concerned, their",50
NA,is at stake. All I have is an assurance,50
NA,the departmental engineer that no one wdl,50
NA,be displaced.,50
NA,I hope that the Minister wUl give the men in,50
NA,the Australian Telecommunications Commission,50
NA,an assurance that whichever of the two systems is,50
NA,introduced-th e Ericsson system or the STC,51
NA,tem-non e of the men who are presently,51
NA,employed in the technical side of Telecom will,51
NA,displaced as a result of the introducuon of that,51
NA,system. If the men are told that there is not going,51
NA,"to be a mammoth lay-off, either now or in the",51
NA,"future, that at least will have the effect of allaying",51
NA,some of their fears.,51
NA,On reading the paper it is obvious that there,51
NA,will not be any monstrous overnight change.,51
NA,think the paper talks in terms of spending $,51
NA,on new equipment by 1980. That amount of,51
NA,$1.3m is not going to have one heck of an effect,51
NA,on employment. We are talking in terms of long debate now.,51
NA,"term changes between now and, say, 1990. The",51
NA,Minister nods his head. I do not want,51
NA,in.,51
NA,Mr Eric Robinson-That is quiteright;there,51
NA,will be no effect on employment at all.,51
Mr CHARLES JONES,The Minister has,51
NA,just interjected to indicate,51
NA,effect on employment at all. I thank him,51
NA,"interjection, which he is not permitted to make. member",51
NA,Mr Eric Robinson- I was trying to be helpful.,51
Mr CHARLES JONES,So the position is adjourned'.,51
NA,that those fellows in Telecom can at least to some,51
NA,degree have their fears allayed as there is not,51
NA,going to be a very substantial lay-off in that,51
NA,tion of Telecom.,51
NA,A Sydney-Melbourne confrontation is,51
NA,developing now as to whether die Ericsson sys-,51
NA,tem is going to be manufactured in Melbourne,51
NA,whether the STC system is going to be manufacdesirable,51
NA,tured in Sydney. I have been informed by the,51
NA,partmental technical people that the newspaper,51
NA,reports which state that $500m worth of equipconduct,51
NA,ment is to be suppUed are not true. The Minister,51
NA,"has not indicated this in his statement, but I",51
NA,that he wUl indicate just how much really is,51
NA,volved. It has been suggested to me that we,51
NA,talking about the manufacture of about $200m,51
NA,"worth of equipment-no t $500m worth, as has researched.",51
NA,"been mentioned in the Press. So, if the Minister",51
NA,can make a statement in that regard it wUl at,51
NA,least clear up the matter.,51
NA,From what the Minister has said in his state-,51
NA,"ment and from the advice that I have received, I House",51
NA,beUeve that the work is to be shared. If STC had honourable,51
NA,"been awarded the original contract, Ericsson his remarks at",51
NA,would have been given portion of the equipment,51
NA,to budd. Now that Ericsson has been awarded,51
NA,"the contract, portion of the equipment likewise",51
NA,to be constructed in the Sydney factory of STC.,51
NA,Plessey Austraha Pty Ltd or some of the other,51
NA,sysmanufacturers of this equipment in AustraUa,51
NA,also could be given some of the work.,51
NA,be I know that other members desire to speak on,51
NA,this statement. In view of the fact that my party is,51
NA,still conferring on this matter and that we have,51
NA,no possible hope of making a decision on it in a,51
NA,"couple of hours, I feel that it might be appropri-",51
NA,ate at this stage ifi were to seek leave to continue,51
NA,my remarks at some latertimeand if the debate,51
NA,I were adjourned. That would aUow the honour-,51
NA,1.3m able member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) to,51
NA,take part in the debate at some later stage.,51
Mr WENTWORTH ,"No , I want to come into the",51
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Lucock)-,51
NA,Order! The question before the House in that,51
NA,event would be that the honourable member for,51
NA,Newcastle be given leave to continue his remarks,51
NA,later.,51
Mr WENTWORTH , I do not give leave. I desire to,51
NA,that it will have no speak now.,51
Mr CHARLES JONES,The honourable,51
NA,for MackeUar has a notice of motion on,51
NA,"this matter on the Notice Paper. In that event, I",51
NA,would move: 'That the debate be now,51
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,"Unfortunately, the",51
NA,secStanding Orders state that one dissenting voice,51
NA,prevents the honourable member from obtaining,51
NA,leave to continue his remarks at a later time. This,51
NA,is not a matter on which the House votes.,51
NA,"or Mr Eric Robinson- Mr Deputy Speaker, it is",51
NA,that the House be run in an orderly,51
NA,demanner. The honourable member for Newcasde,51
NA,has been quite co-operative in relation to the,51
NA,"ofthe debate, as he has explained to the",51
NA,House. Officers of Telecom AustraUa were made,51
NA,hope avaUable to him today. I want to hear any com-,51
NA,inments that the Opposition has to make about this,51
NA,are contract. There is no need for a division of,51
NA,opinion on it. The matter has been thoroughly,51
NA,I wUl not be a party to preventing the,51
NA,"honourable member for Newcastle, if he wishes",51
NA,to make a statement concerning this matter later,51
NA,when he and his party have had more time to,51
NA,"consider it, from doing so.",51
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,I shall ask the,51
NA,again whether leave is granted for the,51
NA,member for Newcastle to continue,51
NA,a later stage.,51
Mr WENTWORTH ,No . I want to make a few,51
NA,is remarks at this present moment. As the Minister,51
NA,"has said, he wUl help the honourable member for",51

NA,as is my right.,52
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! The date-will,52
NA,honourable member for MACKellar has refused,52
NA,leave. The honourable member for Newcastle,52
NA,"still has the opportunity to speak, if he so desires.",52
Mr HURFORD ,"Ma y I have your guidance, Mr notice",52
NA,Deputy Speaker? Would it be in order for me to is debating.,52
NA,move that so much of the Standing Orders be 2073 ofthe ItNotice,52
NA,suspended as would prevent the honourable,52
NA,member for Newcastle from continuing his,52
NA,remarks at a later stage? If such a modon,52
NA,"agreed to, it would allow the honourable memthat",52
NA,ber for MACKellar to come into the debate at,52
NA,stage.,52
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,I think the probeven,52
NA,"lem could be overcome in this way, without",52
NA,Chair actually intervening: If there is an underdeny,52
NA,"standing, which is accepted by the Minister,",52
NA,at a later stage the honourable member,52
NA,castle will be given leave either to make a state-,52
NA,ment or to speak-tha t result could be achieved,52
NA,by obtaining the leave of the House-th e honourto,52
NA,able member for Newcasde can conclude his interested,52
NA,remarks now; I will then call the honourable,52
NA,member for MACKellar; and a modon that the,52
NA,debate be adjourned can be moved by the next,52
NA,speaker or by anyone who desires to do so. At,52
NA,later stage the honourable member for Newdesign,52
NA,"casde, by the authority of the House, can be",52
NA,given leave to speak again in a debate in which,52
NA,he has already spoken. If the Opposition is happy,52
NA,with that arrangement-,52
Mr CHARLES JONES,We accept that.,52
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,I will assess the sidered:,52
NA,situation as being that the honourable member in Australia,52
NA,for Newcastle has concluded his remarks. I shall industry. Arefrom,52
NA,"call the honourable member for MACKellar to decision, a fragmentation",52
NA,speak now on the motion: 'That,52
NA,note ofthe paper'.,52
Mr WENTWORTH ,Mackellar ),52
NA,"(3.0)-Than k you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will not Deputy",52
NA,delay the House for long in speaking on this mat-,52
NA,"ter. In fact, I expect to speak for only a few minin",52
NA,utes. Obviously it is a most important matter. The canvass,52
NA,Minister for Post and Telecommumcations ( Mr Motion No.,52
NA,Eric Robinson) has said in his statement that far have been,52
NA,$700m worth of equipment at current prices is No. 29. 1 ask directed,52
NA,involved. I make no comment at all on the techSpeaker.,52
NA,nical matters involved. I do not know whether,52
NA,the Ericsson (Australia) Pty Ltd system or the,52
NA,STC (Australia) Pty Ltd system is the better sysat,52
NA,"tem, but what I beheve the Government has conbroad.",52
NA,sidered and what I certainly would want to be,52
NA,considered is whether adequate attention has,52
NA,been paid to the nature of Austrahan employ-,52
NA,ment in this regard. One is interested not only in,52
NA,happen in 1985 or at some other future,52
NA,what,52
NA,"Mr Stewart- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a",52
NA,point of order. I note that the honourable mem-,52
NA,ber for Mackellar has on the Notice Paper a,52
NA,of motion on the subject matter which he,52
NA,is Notice of Motion No. 29 at page,52
NA,Paper.,52
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Lucock)-I,52
NA,were point out to the honourable member for Lang,52
NA,at this point of time the honourable member,52
NA,this for Mackellar is speaking to a motion which is,52
NA,before the House. To deny the honourable mem-,52
NA,"ber for Mackellar therightto make comments,",52
NA,though they do parallel a notice of motion,52
NA,"the that he has on the Notice Paper, would be to",52
NA,debate at this stage on this subject matter.,52
NA,that Therefore the honourable member for Mackellar,52
NA,for Newis free to continue his remarks.,52
NA,"Mr WENTWORTH As I said, I do not wish",52
NA,go into the technical matters at all. I am,52
NA,in the matter of Australian content. I,52
NA,am interested not only in what will happen in,52
NA,1985 but also in the possible retention in,52
NA,Australia of the design skills in relation to this,52
NA,a sort of equipment. When a team which has such,52
NA,"skills is built up, it is important that it be",52
NA,maintained. I am not trying to take sides with,52
NA,STC against Ericsson or with Ericsson against,52
NA,STC. All I am asking is that adequate consider-,52
NA,ation be given to this matter because the design,52
NA,teams are important.,52
NA,"However, there is another matter to be con-",52
NA,Already there has been enough trouble,52
NA,we,52
NA,the fragmentation of the motor,52
NA,"to have, as a consequence of this",52
NA,of the electronics,52
NA,the House take industry in Austraha?,52
NA,"Mr Stewart- I raise a point of order, Mr",52
NA,Notice,52
NA,Speaker. Again I draw your attention to,52
NA,of Motion No. 29.1 cannot see anything,52
NA,the statement made by the Mimster which,52
NA,allows the honourable member for Mackellar to,52
NA,the subject matter of his Notice of,52
NA,29. All the remarks he has made so,52
NA,you to,52
NA,towards Notice of Motion,52
NA,"rule on that, Mr Deputy",52
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,I was just looking,52
NA,"the statement of the Minister, which is fairly",52
NA,I point out to the honourable member for,52
NA,Mackellar that he must direct his remarks to the,52
NA,"statement made by the Minister, because it is",52
NA,that statement to which the motion before,53
NA,House refers.,53
Mr WENTWORTH,That is precisely what I,53
NA,am doing. In awarding this contract it is imporsee,53
NA,tant that we look at the future of the industry as a employed,53
NA,whole. I am not supportmg STC (AustraUa) Pty the,53
NA,Ltd against L. M. Ericsson (Austraha) Pty Ltd or which,53
NA,Ericsson against STC. I beUeve that the Govern-,53
NA,ment has considered these matters. I ask the,53
NA,Government to put before the House the way,53
NA,which it has considered them. It is important for,53
NA,the future that we should avoid the fragmen-,53
NA,tation of the electronics industry in AustraUa,53
NA,the same way as the motor industry has been come to order.,53
NA,fragmented by the operation of too many com-,53
NA,peting factors. In his statement the Minister,53
NA,tioned the possibility of the SPC local switchingof,53
NA,equipment being made under Ucence by a secondcriticise,53
NA,manufacturer.,53
NA,Mr Stewart-I t took you a longtimeto wake,53
NA,up to the fragmentation of the motor industry.,53
Mr WENTWORTH,WU1 the honourable near,53
NA,member for Lang be quiet for a moment? He is,53
NA,saying absolutely nothing and he knows it.,53
NA,"Mr Stewart-No, not when you are being so",53
NA,hypocritical. The fragmentation of the motor,53
NA,industry was all done whUe you were in,53
NA,government.,53
Mr WENTWORTH, I am not trying to what,53
NA,attack or defend anybody hi this regard. AU I,53
NA,asking is that the Government show,53
NA,given due consideration to this matter. It,53
NA,be very wrong if the future ofthe AustraUan,53
NA,tronics industry as a whole was jeopardised,53
NA,undue fragmentation. Surely if honourable,53
NA,members opposite have any regard for tions,53
NA,AustraUa's secondary industry and if they are not,53
NA,just trying to make cheap poUtical points at,53
NA,expense they wUl be sUent and give me some,53
NA,support. All I am trying to do is get the maximum,53
NA,employment for Australian workmen and,53
NA,designers and see that the future of the Aus-,53
NA,tralian electronics industry is properly cent,53
NA,safeguarded. I am not saying that the Govern-,53
NA,ment has not already done this. I am not criticis Mr,53
NA,ing the Government's decision. All I am asking is out.,53
NA,that the Government put before the House the,53
NA,reasons for this decision. We should be able to,53
NA,see in its proper perspective how this decision,53
NA,in to the long term objectives of maintaining,53
NA,efficiency of Australia's secondary industry and,53
NA,maintaining the maximum employment in honourable,53
NA,Australia of local workmen and designers.,53
NA,This is not an unreasonable thing to ask.,53
NA,should have thought that in place of this kind,53
NA,niggling objection the Opposition would have,53
NA,the been on side with us. Opposition members,53
NA,should not try to make cheap poUtical points. I,53
NA,am trying to do what they should be doing and,53
NA,that as many AustraUans as possible are,53
NA,here now and in the future and that,53
NA,structure of Australia's secondary industry is,53
NA,as efficient as possible. Is this something on,53
NA,Opposition members want to take points,53
NA,of order?,53
NA,in Mr Stewart-Thi s is a death bed confession.,53
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Lucock)-,53
NA,in Order! The honourable member for Lang wtil,53
Mr WENTWORTH," Mr Deputy Speaker,",53
NA,mensurely I should have the sUence and co-operation,53
NA,the House in this matter. I am not trying to,53
NA,the Government. I am not saying that I,53
NA,know anything about the technology of this mat-,53
NA,"ter. I do not. But I know two things. First, in",53
NA,awarding this contract proper attention should,53
NA,be given to the AustraUan content now and in the,53
NA,"future. Secondly, we should be looking to",53
NA,the long term efficiency of AustraUan secondary,53
NA,industry. These are not the only things to be,53
NA,looked at but it is important that appropriate,53
NA,attention be paid to them. I beUeve that the,53
NA,Government has done this but I would Uke to,53
NA,hear a statement from the Government as to,53
NA,"it has done. Unfortunately, that is not",53
NA,am included in the statement which the Minister has,53
NA,that it has put before us today.,53
Mr KING ,Wimmera) (3.10)- I would have,53
NA,elecbeen quite happy to have had this debate ad-,53
NA,by journed but with the honourable member for,53
NA,MackeUar ( Mr Wentworth)firinga few ques-,53
NA,at the Government I feel that we should,53
NA,discuss it a Uttle further. I remind the honourable,53
NA,its member of this simple and straightforward sen-,53
NA,tence in the statement by the Minister for Post,53
NA,and Telecommunications ( Mr Eric Robinson):,53
NA,The contract with L. M. Ericsson will require a high pro-,53
NA,portion of Australian manufacture reaching at least 80 per,53
NA,as volume increases.,53
NA,Wentworth-But when? This is not spelt,53
Mr KING,I t would be impossible for any,53
NA,Minister to spell out what he was going to do this,53
NA,fitsyear or next year. The Government has accepted,53
NA,the a very important and large tender. No doubt,53
NA,time wUl soon sort out the point about which the,53
NA,member for Mackellar is so terribly,53
NA,worried. I am not worried. I take this opportunity,53
NA,I of congratulating the Government and the Min-,53
NA,of ister in particular for reaching a decision to,53
NA,implement a new scheme that wiU be of great,53
NA,benefit to Australian subscribers over the next,54
NA,few years.,54
NA,My interpretation of this decision is that,54
NA,only will it improve the standard of the equipresources,54
NA,ment that is so necessary in AustraUa but it,54
NA,also help with the cost WhUst we are talking,54
NA,about $500m in one sense I think that the initial,54
NA,cost will be much lower. There is no fear that,54
NA,wUl be a load on the taxpayers. Rather it wUl,54
NA,an advantage to the taxpayers. I was a Uttle,54
NA,cerned to hear the honourable member for Newis,54
NA,castle ( Mr Charles Jones) say that there would,54
NA,be a confrontation between Sydney and Melconcerned,54
NA,bourne as to where aU this equipment wUl be,54
NA,manufactured. Perhaps there is always an arguOnly,54
NA,ment about whether a new factory should be put,54
NA,"in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide or anywhere",54
NA,else. The all important fact is that a decision,54
NA,been made by the Government. I feel that and,54
NA,whether the equipment is manufactured in Sydthese,54
NA,"ney, Melbourne or Adelaide does not mean a",54
NA,tiling. The important thing is that with the acvival,54
NA,"ceptance of this contract, sooner or later we",54
NA,be employing approximately 800 people. That,54
NA,the information supplied to me on this subject.,54
NA,We ought to commend the Government rather,54
NA,than criticise it.,54
NA,I have ho hesitation in saying that once the,54
NA,people reaUse what the Government is doing,54
NA,this field it wUl help considerably. One could,54
NA,at some length about the problems within,54
NA,Australian Telecommunications Commission.,54
NA,do not think I ought to take up thetimeof the,54
NA,House to do that at this stage. Perhaps on,54
NA,other occasion I shall explain the problems,54
NA,within Telecom. I certainly support the motion,54
NA,before the House.,54

Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE , D a w s o n ) over a,54
NA,(3.14)-Whe n I was speaking last Tuesday I said,54
NA,that I would devote some of my speech to aspects,54
NA,of energy within this country. A saying I,54
NA,remembered for many years is that it is against,54
NA,the natural law of God that we should waste that,54
NA,which he has given us. The energy situation,54
NA,today within Australia and throughout the,54
NA,is evidence that we are wasting what has,54
NA,naturally given to us by our creator. AustraUa,54
NA,for many years seen various emphases placed on,54
NA,the development of energy generaUy either,54
NA,"not through nationalisation, the private sector, local",54
NA,or overseas resources. The former,54
NA,wdl Labor Government would have chosen national-,54
NA,isation against aU other methods. The discussion,54
NA,on the matter of pubUc importance today indi-,54
NA,this cated that that is precisely the nature of Oppo-,54
NA,"be sition flunking on the energy situation, our",54
NA,conresources and many other things in AustraUa. It,54
NA,a theme to which I certainly cannot subscribe.,54
NA,An energy resource pohcy has normally been,54
NA,with the type of fuel that AustraUa has,54
NA,"in abundance-coal , uranium and solar energy.",54
NA,"now does the policy recognise, through the",54
NA,"present Budget, the major crisis that confronts",54
NA,AustraUa in its desperately short reserves of oU.,54
NA,"has The emphasis that is placed on coal, uranium",54
NA,solar resources as fuel faUs to recognise that,54
NA,suffer mainly from developing and market-,54
NA,ing problems. OU supply is necessary for the sur-,54
NA,of our rural and transport industries and of,54
NA,wUl the people in this ParUament today. We need,54
NA,is look only at Canberra itself for ample evidence,54
NA,that the impUcations of die crisis have as yet not,54
NA,been appreciated by AustraUans. The consump-,54
NA,tion of oU for heating instead of the use of elec-,54
NA,tricity; the use of diesel in our raUways instead of,54
NA,in steam or electrification; the use of private,54
NA,talk ttansport mainly carrying solo passengers in,54
NA,the preference to community transport are all,54
NA,I examples of the contempt with which all Aus-,54
NA,"traUans, not only Canberrans, treat this critical",54
NA,some subject. Out of every 100 cars used on Can-,54
NA,"berra's roads and streets each morning at, say,",54
NA,8.30 a.m. only about five would multiple carry.,54
NA,This is possibly the same throughout aU the,54
NA,"major cities of AustraUa, yet our pubUc transport",54
NA,its business at substantial losses,54
NA,through lack of patronage.,54
NA,There is little appreciation for the fact that in,54
NA,Second Reading AustraUa the oU industry is in a crisis situation.,54
NA,(Budget Debate) AustraUans must now address themselves to this,54
NA,crisis. The Budget does this through one of the,54
NA,"alternatives, that is, in its pohcy to allow",54
NA,AustraUan crude oU toriseto world parity prices.,54
NA,Stark reality is that the price of petrol wtil rise,54
NA,period by 1 lc per gallon. This is an inevi-,54
NA,table consequence ofthe crisis we now face. The,54
NA,"effects wUl be two-fold. Firstly, it wUl provide an",54
NA,nave encouragement to further exploration and,54
NA,"development. I believe that, coupled with this,",54
NA,have been the incentives of the 1976-77 Budget,54
NA,through taxation measures and the attitude,54
NA,world adopted by this Government only recently,54
NA,been towards the North West Shelf development.,54
NA,has Some people forget that this encouragement,54
NA,through taxation has already been given within,55
NA,the framework of the previous Budget. The seclife time.,55
NA,ond effect is a drive towards conservation,55
NA,through the higher price to be paid for fuel,55
NA,the consumer where alternatives in electricity,55
NA,"available more cheaply, and also through a",55
NA,sensible and sensitive approach to the proper useEven,55
NA,of all our oil based products.,55
NA,I was pleased to note as a further indication,55
NA,"this Government's recognition of the problem,",55
NA,the assistance by the Government to the researchcost,55
NA,and development of the Pritchard steam power,55
NA,unit: Early assistance in the assembly and conthis,55
NA,struction of the engine inthe Commonwealth,55
NA,factory at Bendigo recently produced results,55
NA,the delivery of the engine. In this regard I must,55
NA,pay tribute to the previous Labor Government our,55
NA,which gave its permission and authority for the,55
NA,production of the three engines necessary. It,55
NA,the present Government that carried the,55
NA,development forward and produced this particuUnited,55
NA,lar engine. The Pritchard steam power unit is,55
NA,well recognised for its non-pollutant qualities.,55
NA,"One wonders today whether, where we see the",55
NA,tremendous expense put on to the motor car,55
NA,manufacturers and eventually passed on to the The,55
NA,"consumers for devices to prevent pollution,",55
NA,resulting in the lower consumption of fuel,55
NA,"car, we should automatically turn to these children.",55
NA,alternatives. Within the framework of the,55
NA,"Budget some $100,000 have been set aside for",55
NA,further development of the Pritchard steam,55
NA,power unit.,55
NA,Only yesterday an ill-informed person wrote,55
NA,the Canberra Times commenting upon that of,55
NA,"engine. I agree with him in one respect, namely,",55
NA,that it is absolutely necessary that we as,55
NA,Government and as a people should research,55
NA,this type of alternative. I agree with him in that,55
NA,but he fails to appreciate the situation and,55
NA,position taken by the Government to grant,55
NA,"$100,000 in conjunction with the Victorian",55
NA,Government to further this form of research,55
NA,cause this is the way we should be looking. If,55
NA,engine can use such alternatives as derivatives of,55
NA,"sugar cane, the plant cassava or even natural",55
NA,gas-a n item which we export in great quantitiesgreed,55
NA,at the moment but which we do not make use of,55
NA,in this country where we have an oil shortage- Imon sense.,55
NA,am amazed that we are not getting behind this,55
NA,project more thoroughly. The Granting of the,55
NA,"$100,000 is proof that the Government is",55
NA,interested in researching power units such as,55
NA,that can use alternative power to that produced,55
NA,from oil. More assistance in research is needed,55
NA,we are to cope with the eventual crunch when,55
NA,comes. Clearly the crunch will come within our,55
NA,The Prime Minister's comments in last week's,55
NA,by Canberra Times that Austraha is taking positive,55
NA,are and planned steps to improve its energy tech-,55
NA,morenology must be welcomed by all Australians.,55
NA,"if we are genuine in our efforts, certain free-",55
NA,doms that we have had in the past and the,55
NA,present high standards of living we enjoy wUl,55
NA,ofhave to be sacrificed to some extent. The,55
NA,estimated rise in the price of petrol will be at a,55
NA,to every individual and corporation in,55
NA,"Austraha. The belt will have to betightened,and",55
NA,will be thefirstnotch. It demands that unless,55
NA,we become greater producers of other natural,55
NA,in. assets we as a Government and as a people will,55
NA,have to transferfinancialresources from some of,55
NA,priority areas-thes e could well be in the wel-,55
NA,fare sectors-toward s greater costs of the basic,55
NA,was fuel research and development of and providing,55
NA,for alternatives. A discipline imposed in the,55
NA,States of America m the height ofits fuel,55
NA,crisis recently to reduce the speed of automobiles,55
NA,on the highways effected a 20 per cent saving in,55
NA,amount of fuel used. As a by-benefit it also,55
NA,reduced the death toll by a similar 20 per cent.,55
NA,reality of the crisis is there. Either we face up,55
NA,to the reahty of the situation now or we leave a,55
NA,per terrible legacy to our children and grand-,55
NA,The evidence of the disaster fronting us is all,55
NA,too real. The most developed nation in the world,55
NA,"today, the United States of America, earher this",55
NA,year as a result of a crisis in its energy production,55
NA,in and supply could not prevent the deaths of many,55
NA,its citizens in the coldest snap experienced in,55
NA,that nation in recent times. In this day and age,55
NA,a when we can send a vehicle to the moon we have,55
NA,"not the resources to guarantee warmth, mobility",55
NA,"and Ufe to our people on earth. However, I fail to",55
NA,"the appreciate why, whilst this problem was firmly",55
NA,"recognised and the pohcy developed, the further",55
NA,and corresponding problem of unequal fuel costs,55
NA,bethroughout Austraha was not grasped with the,55
NA,thissame determination. The extreme situation of,55
NA,"discount fuel in capital cities, actually encourag-",55
NA,"ing waste, has been allowed to continue. The",55
NA,of people and industry has never been so,55
NA,obvious as is evidenced by this affront to com-,55
NA,The other extreme of where fuel is an essential,55
NA,requirement and for which there is no substitute,55
NA,or subsidies is in our rural industries. Since,55
NA,thisLabor's withdrawal of the petrol price equaUs-,55
NA,ation scheme rationing has been compulsorily,55
NA,if forced on people in outback AustraUa by price,55
NA,itdifferences of some magnitude. At some places in,55
NA,Queensland I believe the price is as high as $2 a,56
NA,gallon at the moment compared with the normal,56
NA,price of about 80c a gallon on the eastern sea-,56
NA,board. If ever there was an opportunity to stop,56
NA,capital city extravagances and abuse and to assist,56

NA,Order! The honourable member's time has,56
NA,expired.,56
Mr HURFORD ,Adelaide) (3.24)-It is my,56
NA,job as the Opposition's shadow Treasurer to ana-,56
NA,lyse the Budget as an economic document The,56
NA,Fraser Government's pohcies are built on three,56
NA,false prernises and each of the three partly ex-,56
NA,plains this bad Budget wbich we are debating,56
NA,"this afternoon. The first is the 'short, sharp",56
NA,shock' thesis. When this has not worked it has,56
NA,been converted into the 'extended shock' thesis,56
NA,or the 'let's have an extended recession with,56
NA,greater and greater unemployment' approach.,56
NA,The false Liberal and National Country Party,56
NA,belief is that this is the only way to reduce,56
NA,"tion, and that reducing inflation is the sine qua",56
NA,non-th e without which nothing-o f economic,56
NA,recovery. The second false premise which ex-,56
NA,plains so many wrong decisions of the past 21,56
NA,months is that it is necessary to reduce real wages,56
NA,"of men and women of Australia, the real living",56
NA,"standards of Australian people, in order to trans-",56
NA,"fer more profits to the business, particularly the",56
NA,"corporate sector-whic h to them, wrongly, is",56
NA,another sine qua non of economic recovery.,56
NA,The third false premise of the conservatives,56
NA,which explains so much is what I describe as the,56
NA,'bastardised-Friedmanite' theory. It follows,56
NA,false thinking that there is some magic medicine,56
NA,in cutting the supply of money to a dangerously,56
NA,low level. Not even Friedman and his Chicagoite,56
NA,school of economists pursue this false philosophy,56
NA,with the ideological dedication of the Fraser,56
NA,Government.,56
NA,Let me turn to the tragic results of following,56
NA,these three disastrous premises,56
NA,this Budget and by the past economic perfor-,56
NA,mance of the Fraser Government. Remember,56
NA,that the first premise is the need to create that,56
NA,"shock-which , when it did not work, has become",56
NA,the extended shock.,56
NA,The main criticism levelled by me and my,56
NA,colleagues at last year's Budget was that it was,56
NA,too contractionary. The great fear was that the,56
NA,initial stages of recovery evident in early 1976,56
NA,would be choked off by heavy handed govern-,56
NA,ment action. These fears appear to have been,56
NA,"well grounded, as the decline in economic ac-",56
NA,tivity in 1977 illustrates. The high level of econ-,56
NA,omic activity in 1976 occuned when the econ-,56
NA,omy was predominantly under the influence of,56
NA,"the last Labor Budget, known as the Hayden",56
NA,Budget. The Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm,56
NA,Fraser) himself has given credit for economic,56
NA,performance in early 1976 to that Budget. Dur-,56
NA,ing an interview on the Australian Broadcasting,56
NA,Commission current affairs program Four,56
NA,Corners of 18 December 1976 he said:,56
NA,"Look, you've got to remember that in the first part of this",56
NA,"year, you were still operating under the Hayden Budget, and",56
NA,"under Labor policies, and quite obviously it would take some",56
NA,ume for those policies to change.,56
NA,It did take some time for those pohcies to,56
NA,change; and when they did as a result of the first,56
NA,Lynch Budget and of earlier economic actions,56
NA,the economy began a further decline.,56
NA,There are a number of means of measuring the,56
NA,impact a budget will have on an economy. One,56
NA,of these is the calculation of the full employment,56
NA,budget position. Using the fact that in a recession,56
NA,inflagovernment expenditure automatically rises,56
NA,"through increased welfare payments, and re-",56
NA,"ceipts fall through lower tax receipts, calcu-",56
NA,lations are made to obtain what the budgetary,56
NA,position of present expenditure and receipt pat-,56
NA,terns would be at the position of full employ-,56
NA,ment. I and other members of the Opposition,56
NA,have repeatedly asked the Treasurer ( Mr Lynch),56
NA,to supply us with an estimate of last year's,56
NA,Budget's full employment position. The,56
NA,Treasurer has always refused arguing that such a,56
NA,calculation is of dubious worth. This is despite,56
NA,the fact that in the United States of America such,56
NA,the an estimate is made automatically and is used,56
NA,extensively in discussions on budget pohcy. Now,56
NA,the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and,56
NA,Development through the report of a group of,56
NA,independent experts headed by Professor Paul,56
NA,MCCracken has endorsed the use of the full em-,56
NA,ployment budget concept. I know some Govern-,56
NA,ment supporters have noted that I have questions,56
NA,on notice ofthe Treasurer at the presenttimeon,56
NA,as illustrated in this very subject,56
NA,The MCCracken report entitled 'Towards Full,57
NA,Employment and Pnce Stability' is an in-depth expected.,57
NA,study of economic policy in OECD countries in,57
NA,"recent years. The summary ofthe report, in",57
NA,cussion of the impact of budgetary pohcy and the,57
NA,"need for planning, states that the members ofthe",57
NA,Committee 'endorse the ideas underlying,57
NA,approaches made along these Unes in several,57
NA,"countries, for example, the concepts of the full",57
NA,"employment surplus (United States), the",57
NA,tral budget' (Germany) and structural budget,57
NA,pohcy (Netherlands)'. The Treasurer in the past,57
NA,has been fond of expressing satisfaction with the,57
NA,way his Government was carrying out his Unfortunately,57
NA,interpretation of OECD pohcies. The,57
NA,ment of full employment budget calculations by,57
NA,the MCCracken Committee is very difficult to,57
NA,misinterpret. The only reason the Government,57
NA,can have for not publishing such calculations,57
NA,that it is afraid of admitting just how contracmoderate,57
NA,tionary its Budget pohcy has been. I refer not,57
NA,only to last year's Budget but to this<year's,57
NA,Budget as well. Here comes the crunch. The growth,57
NA,Institute of Applied Economic and Social,57
NA,Research at Melbourne University has made calexceed,57
NA,culations for the full employment position of,57
NA,1976-77 Budget. That Institute assumed that,57
NA,realistic level of unemployment at a high level,57
NA,economic activity would be 2 per cent. Using this,57
NA,basic assumption it found that the 1976-77 ings,57
NA,Budget was in modest surplus at full employmean,57
NA,ment. This means that it found that the $2.8,57
NA,billion deficit was entirely a function of the,57
NA,extension of recession. The pubhc sector was not,57
NA,being used to pump up the level of economic acenough,57
NA,tivity. Initial calculations on the full employmentsavings.,57
NA,position of this year's Budget reveal a substanresults,57
NA,tially higher full employment surplus than last,57
NA,year. This means that budgetary pohcy is being,57
NA,actively used to withdraw resources from the,57
NA,vate sector and hence slowdown economic being,57
NA,activity.,57
NA,Professor John Neville of the University of,57
NA,New South Wales gave a paper last year on,57
NA,another single figure measurement of the impact,57
NA,of budget pohcy. This measurement is termed,57
NA,the budget impulse. Using one particular form,57
NA,"the budget impulse calculation, Professor tax",57
NA,Neville found that last year's Budget represented,57
NA,a much greater contraction of the direction of,57
NA,fiscal pohcy than any budget in recent history.,57
NA,PreUminary estimates indicate that the 1977-78,57
NA,Budget wtil have a further substantial contracchances,57
NA,tionary impact. One measure is obvious from,57
NA,these complex calculations: Budget pohcy has,57
NA,been highly restrictive and with hindsight the,57
NA,renewed downturn of early 1977 was only to be,57
NA,Despite the fact that this Budget predicts Uttle,57
NA,a disimprovement in unemployment or inflation I,57
NA,consider that the forecasts in Statement No. 2 are,57
NA,overly optimistic. There is every reason to,57
NA,the assume that the contractionary impact the,57
NA,Government'sfirstBudget had on the economy,57
NA,wUl be repeated with this the second Budget. Ac-,57
NA,'neucording to the Budget national income is,57
NA,expected to grow by about 4 per cent over the,57
NA,course of thisfinancialyear-tha t is from the,57
NA,June quarter of 1977 to the June quarter of 1978.,57
NA,it is very difficult to identify the,57
NA,endorsesource of this expected growth.,57
NA,Private consumption expenditure which,57
NA,accounts for some 60 per cent of national income,57
NA,is is expected to show moderate growth this year. A,57
NA,increase in consumption was also,57
NA,expected last financial year. The actual increase,57
NA,was 1.7 per cent. If this year's so-called moderate,57
NA,"in consumption is the same as last year's,",57
NA,it seems inconceivable that income growth will,57
NA,the 1.3 per cent achieved over the course,57
NA,the of 1976-77. Nothing put foward by the Govern-,57
NA,a ment suggests that there wUl be any substantial,57
NA,of increase in consumption. Indeed on the Govern-,57
NA,ment's own admission real average weekly earn-,57
NA,are Ukely to fall over 1977-78. This can only,57
NA,"that people will have less to spend, thus",57
NA,reducing the total demand for goods and ser-,57
NA,vices. It is unlikely with inflation and unemploy-,57
NA,ment still high that consumers wtil feel confident,57
NA,to reduce substantially the level of then-,57
NA,This supposition is supported by the,57
NA,of a survey of consumer sentiment con-,57
NA,ducted by the Melbourne Institute of Applied,57
NA,Economic and Social Research. The Institute,57
NA,prifound that 'Measures to reduce real incomes are,57
NA,reflected in consumer attitudes'. The con-,57
NA,stant harping from the Government on the need,57
NA,to reduce real wages can only reinforce the tend-,57
NA,ency of consumers to save rather than spend.,57
NA,In the short term there is likely to be a fall in,57
NA,consumption. With the rebate system in oper-,57
NA,ation tax refunds are much lower this year. Per-,57
NA,sonal income wtil not receive the boost it usuaUy,57
NA,of does at this time of the year. Consequendy the,57
NA,refund buying spree is not Ukely to be of any,57
NA,significance. With expenditure cuts having an,57
NA,"immediate impact, the prospect of early contrac-",57
NA,tion is far from remote. This wtil further dampen,57
NA,confidence and further reduce the already slim,57
NA,of significant stimulous from the,57
NA,all February tax changes. A number of recent sur-,57
NA,veys have demonstrated that the great majority,57
NA,"of taxpayers, in the face ofrisinguncertainty",57
NA,"about the future, are unlikely to increase",58
NA,sumer spending even with substantial income,58
NA,"cuts. The announced changes, which heavily",58
NA,"favour the better-off, are more likely to lead",58
NA,higher savings or expenditure on imported luxurLast,58
NA,ies and overseas travel with Uttle resultant,58
NA,impact on domestic activity in this country.,58
NA,The Government expects private investment,58
NA,to be a substantial source of growth in this finanexpected,58
NA,cial year. Litde explanation is given for this,58
NA,"mism. Indeed, with falUng demand, high stocks",58
NA,and already substantial excess capacity in manurespond,58
NA,"facturing industry, there appears htde incentive",58
NA,for increased investment in expanding prolower,58
NA,ductive capacity. The ratio of private stocks to,58
NA,non-farm product is at its highest level since,58
NA,"1974, thus reflecting the faUure of consumer dethe",58
NA,mand to Uve up to business expectations. Hence,58
NA,stock building is unlikely to add to,58
NA,growth. The added impost of a rise in company,58
NA,tax rates is unlikely to engender the confidence,58
NA,the private sector wUl need before it wUl expand.the,58
NA,Investment in the niining industry wUl probably,58
NA,increase but as this form of investment accounts,58
NA,for less than 1 per cent of non-farm gross,58
NA,"national product, its overall effect will",58
NA,minimal.,58
NA,The home buUding industry is expected by the,58
NA,Government to be another area of substantial,58
NA,growth. This forecast already has had doubt cast,58
NA,upon it by the AustraUan Housing Association,58
NA,and other parts of the industry itself. In a,58
NA,ment accompanying their 1976-77 annual per,58
NA,"report, the directors of Jennings Industries",58
NA,"Australia's largest home butider, criticised the",58
NA,Federal Government for 'faUing to provide,58
NA,measures in the Budget to lift the current level,58
NA,activity in the budding industry'. The directors,58
NA,"further pointed out that, without selective stimu-",58
NA,"lus, unemployment would continue to increase",58
NA,and pubUc confidence-a n important element in,58
NA,the functioning of the private housing sectortion,58
NA,would decline. Further evidence of a bleak table.,58
NA,future for the buUding industry comes from the,58
NA,latest ANZ Bank Survey of Construction,58
NA,"tivity, pubhshed just 2 weeks before the Budget.",58
NA,A survey of 336 members of the Master Builders,58
NA,Federation of AustraUa and the AustraUan,58
NA,eration of Construction Contractors reported,58
NA,"tight profit margins, depressed levels of activity,the",58
NA,a surplus of unemployed labour and tough comlocal,58
NA,petition for the inadequate supply of avaUable,58
NA,contracts.,58
NA,The Government assumes that an sustainable,58
NA,improvement in the balance of payments wUl,58
NA,"contribute to growth. However, some slowing",58
NA,down in the rate of growth in major industrial,58
NA,"concountries is evident this year, so demand for",58
NA,tax exports may not grow substantiaUy. The Bureau,58
NA,of Agricultural Economics actuaUy has forecast,58
NA,to an 8 per cent fall in the value of rural exports.,58
NA,financial year rural exports accounted for,58
NA,some 44 per cent of total exports. An 8 per cent,58
NA,drop in almost half of our exports wUl leave a lot,58
NA,of making up to be done before exports can be,58
NA,to make a substantial positive contribu-,58
NA,"opti-tion. The value of imports may, however, con-",58
NA,tinue torise.Imports have taken a long time to,58
NA,"to devaluation, suggesting that perhaps",58
NA,the price elasticity of demand from imports is,58
NA,"than expected. In other words, consumers",58
NA,"still prefer imported goods, even at higher prices.",58
NA,All this suggests that a further deterioration in,58
NA,"current account deficit is quite possible, mak-",58
NA,ing a forecast of growth derived from the over-,58
NA,income seas sector very suspect indeed.,58
NA,I turn now to another of the theories on which,58
NA,Fraser Government's poUcy is based. I have,58
NA,said already that I do not beUeve that the Budget,58
NA,wUl Uve up to expectations in relation to growth.,58
NA,I have Ulustrated this from the point of view of,58
NA,"be consumer demand, investment decisions de-",58
NA,mand and the overseas sector. What I have,58
NA,called the Friedmanite theory also has to be,58
NA,related to this Budget. I am bound to say that if,58
NA,"monetary pohcy, as oudined in the Budget, is fol-",58
NA,"lowed it wtil, as happened last year, severely",58
NA,hamstring any possibUity of recovery. The,58
NA,stateannounced target of money supply growth of 8,58
NA,cent to 10 per cent is far below the prediction,58
NA,"Ltd, for nominal money income growth of around 15",58
NA,"per cent. There is every evidence to suggest that,",58
NA,"as in the last 12 months,tightmonetary pohcy",58
NA,of wUl have a greater effect on retarding growth,58
NA,than on restraining price increases.,58
NA,The Government has made much recently of,58
NA,the prospect of faUing interest rates. The reduc-,58
NA,in the deficit is supposed to make that inevi-,58
NA,"However, this proposition ignores reatity.",58
NA,"In spite of the cut in the deficit, the total pubhc",58
NA,Acsector borrowing requirement has not been,58
NA,reduced. The drop in the total borrowing pro-,58
NA,gram for the Commonwealth Budget and non-,58
NA,"FedBudget sectors from $3,025m to $2,960m has",58
NA,been more than offset by ariseof over $300m in,58
NA,"borrowings of State, semi-government and",58
NA,government authorities. The real situation,58
NA,is that the pubhc sector wUl be out to borrow,58
NA,more than it did last year. This means that no,58
NA,drop in interest rates is possible,58
NA,within the confines of the Government's restric-,58
NA,tive monetary targets. Any interest rate drop in,58
NA,the next Government loan must be regarded as a,58
NA,"sheer gimmick, unless the monetary growth tar-",59
NA,"gets are eased. The State governments, to their",59
NA,"credit, are forcing a reduction in interest rates.",59
NA,But let us be clear: This means that the money,59
NA,supply growth targets announced in the Budget,59
NA,"are meaningless. Hopefully, this is so.",59
NA,"From what I have just outlined, it is more than",59
NA,"possible that consumers, investors and the over-",59
NA,seas sector will add nothing to real income,59
NA,"growth in 1977-78. In this situation the foolishtively,",59
NA,ness of further cuts in the real level of governunit,59
NA,ment oudays is even clearer-especiall,59
NA,cuts predominantly fall in those capital works,59
NA,areas which have the greatest stimulatory effect,59
NA,on the economy. Far from getting the 4 per,59
NA,growth in non-farm product predicted over the,59
NA,"course of this financial year, it appears that",59
NA,will be fortunate if there is any growth. The,59
NA,bourne Institute's forecast of growth from June,59
NA,"to June of about 1 per cent, or close to last year's",59
NA,"level, looks even optimistic. Such a performance",59
NA,by the economy would see the prediction of,59
NA,"Government's adviser, Professor Warren tragedy.",59
NA,"Hogan, of unemployment of 8 per cent, or almost",59
NA,"500,000 people become a reality in early 1978.",59
NA,The tragedy of all this is that the extended,59
NA,shock thesis which I mentioned in opening my,59
NA,Budget debate remarks is not working. This patently,59
NA,"financial year, 1977-78, will be the third year",59
NA,succession during which prices have risen by,59
NA,something of the order of 12 per cent. In other,59
NA,"words, we still have inflation. In the same 3-year",59
NA,period unemployment will haverisenby somemodest,59
NA,"where between 100,000 and 200,000",59
NA,"nificantly, most of thatrisehas occurred or will",59
NA,occur during the period when the major thrust,59
NA,pohcy has been towards lowering the inflation,59
NA,"rate. Given these unhappy facts, there is",59
NA,reason to question the assumption made by the,59
NA,Government that present policies will sigmake,59
NA,nificantly lower the rate of price increases.,59
NA,"said earher, it has been the cornerstone",59
NA,Government pohcy that inflation had to be,59
NA,beaten before sustainable recovery was possible.,59
NA,Any suggestion that recovery itself would be,59
NA,effective means of combating inflation has been,59
NA,"ridiculed by the Government. We of the Oppotion,",59
NA,sition ignore that theory altogether.,59
NA,More and more evidence is gathering that the,59
NA,"Government is not right, and never has been",59
NA,"right, in using its 'suffer now so that we",59
NA,prosper later' approach. It is very easy on present,59
NA,policies to see the economy being locked into,59
NA,annual inflation rates of 10 per cent to 12,59
NA,"cent, even at very subdued levels of activity.",59
NA,"Indeed, one of the Government's own council",59
NA,"economic advisers, Professor Whitehead, fore-",59
NA,"cast this last week. In many instances, the excess",59
NA,capacity and lack of demand in Austrahan indus-,59
NA,try is acting as a stimulus to price increases rather,59
NA,than as a deterrent. Firms in a monopoly or oli-,59
NA,gopoly situation will continue to keep profit,59
NA,levels up in the face of flagging demand. Obvi-,59
NA,"ously, if their costs are spread across lower than",59
NA,"E otential output, the price per unit of output will",59
NA,ave to be higher to sustain profit levels. Alterna-,59
NA,if demand and output were torisethen,59
NA,costs would fall and the necessity for price,59
NA,y as the rises would decline.,59
NA,The problem is a classic one of the Govern-,59
NA,cent ment applying market control forces where,59
NA,plainly the market is not functioning as expected.,59
NA,we Restrictive policies have well and truly met the,59
NA,Melpoint of fast diminishing returns. The Govern-,59
NA,ment's refusal to use the pubhc sector to create,59
NA,"employment, or to aid in the restructuring of",59
NA,"industry, or indeed to reduce inflation by reduc-",59
NA,"the ing unit costs by encouraging output, is a",59
NA,"In fact, one of the major negative con-",59
NA,tributions this Government has made to econ-,59
NA,omic debate in Austraha has been its propa-,59
NA,ganda which aims at discrediting any suggestions,59
NA,ofthe value of public sector stimulus or the adop-,59
NA,tion of a more rational monetary policy. It is,59
NA,absurd to suggest that there is no scope,59
NA,in for stimulatory fiscal pohcy at the moment.,59
NA,There is scope. The general consensus of the dis-,59
NA,cussions on economic pohcy the week before last,59
NA,at the ANZAAS Conference was that a policy of,59
NA,stimulus was not only possible but also,59
NA,"and, signecessary or essential.",59
NA,of This is the basic difference between the short,59
NA,term approaches to the economy ofthe Govern-,59
NA,every ment and the Opposition. There is not a,59
NA,"difference of degree, as some have attempted to",59
NA,out. There is a fundamental difference of,59
NA,As I approach. A Labor government would be com-,59
NA,of mitted to a program under which all pohcy,59
NA,instruments would be directed towards using,59
NA,recovery to assist in overcoming inflationary,59
NA,an pressures. At present when the Government's,59
NA,arms of pohcy are all working in the one direc-,59
NA,"which is not very often, they are designed to",59
NA,purge inflation from the system by dehberately,59
NA,"restraining activity. For the Government, no",59
NA,recovery is to be facilitated before inflation,59
NA,"reaches acceptable levels. As indicated earlier,",59
NA,may there are good reasons to beheve that this,59
NA,"method will not work and, even if it did, the costs",59
NA,to the community are too high to pay. The only,59
NA,per common ground between the Opposition and the,59
NA,Government on economic pohcy is a recognition,59
NA,of that inflation has to be reduced.,59

Mr FALCONER ,Casey) (3.44)-This is a,60
NA,"Budget of economic realism, expenditure res-",60
NA,"traint, taxadon reform and human concern. It is a",60
NA,Budget of economic realism because it offers,60
NA,prospects of a further reduction in the rate of,60
NA,inflauon and some real economic growth for the,60
NA,second year in a row. It offers the prospect of an,60
NA,increase in employment of 2 per cent leading to,60
NA,some reduction in unemployment. It offers the,60
NA,prospect of an increase in business investment,60
NA,spending and a gradual reduction in interest,60
NA,rates. I was interested to read recently an econ-,60

NA,shortly after the Budget and deUvered by J. B.,60
NA,"Donovan, the company's chief economist, at",60
NA,W.D.Scott scott economic forecasting confer-,60
NA,ences held during August. The forecast states:,60
NA,. . . It is feasible to predict a great deal about the upper,60
NA,and lower limits to the rate of inflation through the rest of,60
NA,1977 and 1978. This is because the future for several ofthe,60
NA,factors that influence inflation,60
NA,"viz.,",60
NA,after the effects of the November 1976 devaluation,60
NA,(net) are fully absorbed in,60

NA,ing the little heeded proviso that the 8 per cent to 10 per,60
NA,cent channel of money supply growth will be flexible if,60
NA,"necessary, it appears that the behaviour of the monetary",60
NA,aggregates will be consistent with a falling rate of infla-,60
NA,tion.,60
NA,as the Budget deficit is lower this financial year than,60
NA,"last, the governments new borrowing program is less, the",60
NA,need for official maintenance of our high interest rates is,60

NA,somewhat.,60
NA,It concludes:,60
NA,"In respect of their influence,",60
NA,money supply and interest rates bold the prospect of reduc-,60

NA,Whidam years.,60
NA,I mentioned earUer that this was a Budget,60
NA,taxation reform. The new standard rate taxation,60
NA,system means that 90 per cent of taxpayers wtil,60
NA,be on a standard rate of marginal tax of 32c for,60
NA,every extra doUar earned. Steeply increasing,60
NA,rates of marginal tax have been a disincentive,60
NA,not only to the high income earners but also to,60
NA,the average wage earner wanting to earn extra,60
NA,overtime as weU as to the small businessman,60
NA,wanting to take additional risks for the prospect,60
NA,of additional reward.,60
NA,The Government's tax reforms are laudable,60
NA,but there is one high priority area which must be,60
NA,given attention in the next stage of taxation,60
NA,reform. I refer to the relative disadvantage ofthe,60
NA,single income family where one parent works,60
NA,and the other looks after the home and the fam-,60
NA,ily. Where many famUies now have two bread,60
NA,winners the single income family feels under,60
NA,great pressure to bring a second income into the,60
NA,farnily to maintain a comparable standard of,60
NA,Uving. I am not objecting to both parents work-,60
NA,ing nor am I wishing to justify the hoary old,60
NA,statement that a woman's place is in the home.,60
NA,What I am saying is that there ought to be a,60
NA,genuine choice about whether both parents work,60
NA,or only one works.,60
NA,"is already fairly well charted,",60
NA,WhUst the two income famUy contributes to,60
NA,increased national productivity it also adds to the,60
NA,"the annual rate figures, it can",60
NA,commumty costs in some important respects. The,60
NA,absence of both parents from the home leads to,60
NA,increased demands for chUd care facUities and,60
NA,welfare services which are provided as a matter,60
NA,of course in the traditional one income family. I,60
NA,am finding increased concern in my electorate,60
NA,that present taxation and family allowance pro-,60
NA,visions do not give significant acknowledgement,60
NA,of the social and economic role performed by the,60
NA,full-time home maker. The family allowance sys-,60
NA,tem introduced last year was a significant social,60
NA,reform but many of the social welfare activists in,60
NA,our community have not given sufficient credit to,60
NA,"export and import prices, the",60
NA,the Government for that reform.,60
NA,It put additional funds into the hands of large,60
NA,low income famUies where the help was most,60
NA,"needed, but in a period of inflation when prices",60
NA,"and wages are still rising, when taxes are subject",60
NA,to indexation and social security pensions are,60
NA,"indexed, the relative values of those famUy al-",60
NA,lowances declines. Quite apart from dealing with,60
NA,this problem of the declining value of family al-,60
NA,"at lowances, the Government-indeed , the whole",60
NA,Parliament-shoul d consider ways of conecting,60
NA,the relative disadvantage of the single income,60
NA,It could be done by a variety of taxation,60
NA,mechanisms or by the provision of an allowance,60
NA,of for a full-time home maker added to the present,60
NA,famtiy aUowance system. I would Uke to see,60
NA,greater debate on such alternative proposals.,60
NA,There is one vital area which this Budget has,61
NA,given support to the family under stress. It,61
NA,reflects the human concern expressed,61
NA,Budget for high priority areas of need. I,61
NA,the extension of the handicapped child's allowUnions,61
NA,ance. The Government is conscious of the ad-,61
NA,ditional costs that can be incurred,61
NA,handicapped child at home. At present low year the ACTU,61
NA,income families may not be eligible for the AustraUan maritime,61
NA,handicapped child's allowance because their the bans on the ChUean,61
NA,child does not satisfy the medical criteria,61
NA,severely handicapped child. This can lead to partion and have continued thethat,61
NA,ticular hardship. The Government in this,61
NA,has now decided to extend eligibility for the blatantly political use of industrial action.of,61
NA,handicapped child's allowance. The Director-,61
NA,"General of Social Services, at his discretion, will plain",61
NA,be able to grant a handicapped child's allowance was,61
NA,"of up to $15 a week to a person on low income Wriedt,",61
NA,"who has the custody, care and control of a sub-",61
NA,stantially handicapped child who at present does,61
NA,not fully meet the medical criteria.,61
NA,I wish to turn now to a matter of vital impor-,61
NA,"tance to the export industries of Australia,",61
NA,ticularly our primary industries. Australia has,61
NA,developed as a great trading nation and anything cott,61
NA,which damages the performance of our export imposed in protest,61
NA,industries damages the ability of our economy to atrocities in East Timor.,61
NA,recover fully. A number of union bans and boywere imposed no Indonesian,61
NA,cotts are preventing the shipment of,61
NA,trahan export cargoes and are resulting in the Indonesianflagvessels designedthis,61
NA,loss of vital export markets. In a period when trade have been launched. I am further,61
NA,many Austrahan industries have become uncom-,61
NA,petitive in world markets because of our inflathat,61
NA,"tionary cost pressures ofthe Whitlam years, it is a meet",61
NA,tragedy that export industries,61
NA,able to compete internationally are,61
NA,pered by capricious and often politically flour. The market is seen as oneof,61
NA,motivated industrial action. Some bans on potential in the future. That market iseven,61
NA,exports and the servicing of overseas vessels are,61
NA,based on ideological objections to the pohtical,61
NA,complexion of overseas governments or to,61
NA,actions that those governments have taken.,61
NA,Other bans are used to support restrictive work Government,61
NA,practices by AustraUan unions.,61
NA,A prime example of the first,61
NA,based on ideological objections to another,61
NA,government-i s the ban on cargo bound for,61
NA,"Chile. Due to a ban by the Waterside Workers tioned,",61
NA,"Federation imposed in 1974 on exports to Chtie,",61
NA,cargo cannot be marked or manifested through,61
NA,for Chile. Consequently there have been no,61
NA,wheat shipments from AustraUa to Chile since,61
NA,August 1974. The Waterside Workers Federried,61
NA,ation of Austraha and maritime unions have,61
NA,imposed these bans in protest against the poUtimany,61
NA,cal complexion of the ChUean Government and,61
NA,its poUcies. There is not even the sUghtest pre-,61
NA,tence that these bans are related to any genuine,61
NA,in the industrial issue.,61
NA,refer to In 1974 the AustraUan CouncU of Trade,61

NA,in caring for a foUowing,61

NA,and waterfront unions Uft,61
NA,wheat trade. The unions,61
NA,for a concerned refused to accept,61
NA,bans.,61
NA,recommenda-,61
NA,I hope that the,61
NA,Budget Opposition wUl support my condemnation,61
NA,It,61
NA,this,61
NA,is,61
NA,industrial blackmaU. The correct position,61
NA,stated succinctly by the former Mimster for,61
NA,"Agriculture in the Labor Government, Senator",61
NA,when he said in respect of these bans.,61
NA,It is a matter for the government of the day to make a,61
NA,judgment as to whether Australia continues to trade with a,61
NA,"country, and on what basis. I do not think it is the role of any",61
NA,group in the community to make decisions of the nature of,61
NA,this loading ban.,61
NA,parAnother example of a poUtically motivated boy-,61
NA,is the ACTU ban on the handUng of,61
NA,Indonesian flag vessels. These bans were,61
NA,against alleged Indonesian,61
NA,At the time the bans,61
NA,flagvessels existed.,61
NA,many AusI am informed that since early,61
NA,year some,61

NA,the specification of the ships is such as would,61
NA,the exacting requirements of Australian,61
NA,which are well black ban unions.,61
NA,maritime Now AustraUan unions are to,61
NA,being hamper cent of Australia's In,61
NA,those vessels. 1976 Indonesia took 6,61
NA,exports wheat and,61
NA,with,61
NA,now,61
NA,greater,61
NA,in,61
NA,jeopardy. I am not arguing the merits or demerits,61
NA,of the Government of the country concerned. I,61
NA,abhor the reported actions of the Indonesian,61
NA,in East Timor. But if we ban exports,61
NA,because we do not Uke a particular government's,61
NA,"poUtical colour or actions, then we wtil not be",61
NA,doing very much trade with many other,61
NA,type of ban-on e countries at all.,61
NA,I move onto the other type of ban I have men-,61
NA,"that is, action designed to support restric-",61
NA,tive and protective practices by certain unions.,61
NA,"For example, I mentioned the bans and demands",61
NA,placed on Utah Mining AustraUa Ltd by the Sea-,61
NA,mens Union of AustraUa to force coal to be car-,61
NA,in Australian flag ships with Australian,61
NA,crews. That demand may seem reasonable in,61
NA,respects but jobs for AustraUans cannot be,61
NA,guaranteed when Australians price themselves,61
NA,out of world markets. International comparisons,62
NA,show that employing Austrahan seamen is vasdy,62
NA,"more expensive than employing seamen from therefore,",62
NA,other countries. In making comparisons I refer,62
NA,"the developed countries, not just the low",62
NA,countries.,62
NA,At present the annual cost,62
NA,shipowner of employing an Austrahan able,62
NA,"man is about $23,000 which is more than 200",62
NA,cent higher than the cost to a British shipowner.,62
NA,An Austrahan seaman enjoys 6 weeks more,62
NA,leave per annum than his British counterpart.,62
NA,"Furthermore, Austrahan costs are from 25 per",62
NA,cent to 50 per cent higher than crew costs,62
NA,"United States of America, West Germany",62
NA,Sweden. If seamen's demands were acceded,62
NA,by Utah the freight rate wouldrisefrom $9 to,62
NA,$18 per tonne and would quite clearly place,62
NA,company in an untenable position.,62
NA,"ter for Transport ( Mr Nixon) said recently,",62
NA,"is doing AustraUan farmers, miners, exporters",62
NA,and in fact the AustraUn people a great service,62
NA,standing firm against the union's demands.,62
NA,Seamen's Union has priced itself out ofthe marthat,62
NA,"ket and however much we would Uke it, AustraUan",62
NA,Australia cannot afford to employ Australian flag,62
NA,carriers in highly competitive industries such,62
NA,the coal industry. We cannot penalise competicated,62
NA,tive export industries in order to protect groups,62
NA,which have developed artificially high cost,62
NA,structures.,62
NA,An even more extraordinary example of union,62
NA,action is the ban promoted by the Australasian,62
NA,Meat Industry Employees Union on the export,62
NA,Uve sheep to the Middle East. That union,62
NA,wrote letters to the Prime Ministers of Saudi,62
NA,Arabia and Kuwait in April this year threatening,62
NA,to ban the export of Uve sheep unless those,62
NA,tries took more sheep carcasses. What an arromovement,62
NA,"gant, pompous mob of industrial blackmaUers!",62
NA,repeat that when Senator Wriedt was a Minister,62
NA,in the AustraUan Labor Party Government,62
NA,stated:,62
NA,It is a matter for the Government of the day to make a,62
NA,judgment as to whether Australia continues,62
NA,"country, and on what basis.",62
NA,I suggest that if a country is prepared to buy,62
NA,trahan goods or produce at a proper market,62
NA,then AustraUa is hardly in a position to place,62
NA,costly conditions on the sale which are designed,62
NA,to force that country to pay for higher cost,62
NA,ements of our economy. Decisions about mduswhole,62
NA,try protection should be the subject of separate,62
NA,"Government consideration, not an imposition",62
NA,way of capricious action by a few union officials,62
NA,not answerable to the pubUc. Action of this,62
NA,nature by a few AustraUan unions is damaging,62
NA,"AustraUa's reputation as a stable, reUable sup-",62
NA,"plier of basic commodities. What is at stake,",62
NA,is not merely the sales of the particular,62
NA,to commodities I have mentioned. What is at stake,62
NA,wage is the future of our more competitive export,62
NA,industries and our international standing as a,62
NA,to an Austrahan major trading nation.,62
NA,seaI beUeve that the Budget which has been,62
NA,per brought down by the Treasurer ( Mr Lynch),62
NA,gives guidance to the country as to how we can,62
NA,continue to get ourselves out of the economic,62
NA,problems which were a result of sociaUst poUcies,62
NA,pursued by the previous Government. But apart,62
NA,in the from a Budget which was brought down by a,62
NA,"or Government, we must also have a community",62
NA,to attitude which places an emphasis on personal,62
NA,incentive and on the sort of cost consciousness,62
NA,the that we need to make ourselves competitive once,62
NA,As the Minisagain in world markets.,62
Mr JAMES ,Hunter) (4.0)-The honourable,62
NA,member for Casey ( Mr Falconer) in his usual,62
NA,in dignified way launched a vicious verbal assault,62
NA,The on AustraUan trade unions. I honestly believe,62
NA,had it not been for the strength and unity of,62
NA,trade unions the overall population of,62
NA,AustraUa today would not be enjoying its present,62
NA,as standard of living. The honourable member indi-,62
NA,that he was strongly opposed to the mari-,62
NA,time unions taking action against the handUng of,62
NA,Indonesian ships. I think his speech would have,62
NA,been more balanced had he added to those,62
NA,remarks that the Australian trade union move-,62
NA,"ment, and particularly the maritime unions, have",62
NA,of been consistent all the way down the Une with,62
NA,even Indonesia. The Indonesian Government was,62
NA,reminded late last year by several members of,62
NA,the AustraUan Labor Party when they were in,62
NA,counIndonesia and when the Australian trade union,62
NA,was being criticised by the heads of,62
NA,"I the Indonesian Government, that the Austrahan",62
NA,trade union movement employed simUar embar-,62
NA,he goes and fought just as tenaciously for the,62
NA,Indonesians when they werefightingfor,62
NA,independence against the more or less harsh,62
NA,to trade with a Dutch colonialists.,62
NA,The honourable member for Casey faded to,62
NA,Ausmention on which side he came down when he,62
NA,pricespoke about the maritime unions of AustraUa,62
NA,refusing to load and man the Jeparit when it was,62
NA,"taking munitions to that awful, dirty war in Viet-",62
NA,elnam not so many years ago and which today the,62
NA,world frowns on. Were the actions ofthe,62
NA,unions wrong then? I say no. Their actions are,62
NA,"by not wrong in connection with Chtie, because",62
NA,Chile has a mUitary government which over-,62
NA,threw a true democracy. It was a people's elected,62
NA,democracy. I mentioned in the Parhament only,62
NA,the other night that things had not changed,63
NA,much since the eighteenth century when people,63
NA,in Britain put up arguments which were the same,63
NA,as honourable members of the Liberal Party are,63
NA,putting up today. The arguments related to econ-,63
NA,omic advantages and about pricing ourselves out,63
NA,"of overseas markets. That was the argument, and",63
NA,"it is worth a brief mention again, which was",63
NA,raised in Britain at thetimeofthe slave trade.,63
NA,That outstanding moralist politician William,63
NA,Wilberforce was endeavouring to influence Bri-,63
NA,tain. When William Wilberforce put a Bill before,63
NA,the House of Commons seventimesseeking to,63
NA,"abolish the slave trade, which is to the everlast-",63
NA,"ing disgrace of our mother country, he was told",63
NA,that Britain's foreign exchange would suffer if,63
NA,"Britain abolished the slave trade, that her sea-",63
NA,men would be put out of work and that the ship,63
NA,building industry in Britain would become,63
NA,"redundant. Britain then, as now, professed to be",63
NA,"a Christian country, but it was involved up to",63
NA,hilt and had a monopoly over the slave trade in,63
NA,"the world, carting slaves from northern Africa-",63
NA,"manacled together, on starvation diets, below",63
NA,the decks of ships-manacle d together like sar-,63
NA,dines-i n the main to the West Indies. That is,63
NA,same argument which honourable members on,63
NA,"the Government side advance today, not the",63
NA,moral argument but the quid argument because,63
NA,they belong to the quid party. I hope to develop,63
NA,that proposition more strongly iftimepermits in,63
NA,this debate.,63
NA,Mr Falconer-Wh y do you not answer Senafigures,63
NA,tor Wriedt's argument?,63
Mr JAMES,I did not interrupt the honour-,63
NA,able member for Casey. Apparently he is getting,63
NA,stirred up by the truth that I am speaking now. positive,63
NA,"However, we are debating the 1977-78 Budget",63
NA,launched by the Treasurer ( Mr Lynch). Everyyoung,63
NA,one agrees that Austraha has two overriding,63
NA,"economic problems, namely, unemployment and",63
NA,"inflation. Many of the Western countries are Hunter,",63
NA,suffering from the same problems yet Mr Fraser,63
NA,"and Mr Lynch have given us a Budget which, in",63
NA,"the opinion of most economists, does nothing",63
NA,about either of these problems except make,63
NA,worse.,63
NA,I think it is appropriate for me to disclose,63
NA,the Parhament in this debate the latest unemhas,63
NA,ploymentfigureswhich have been released by,63
NA,the Australian Bureau of Statistics today. The,63
NA,Australian Bureau of Statistics unemployment,63
NA,survey for August shows a disastrous slide in,63
NA,labour market and it is projected that unemployan,63
NA,"ment willriseto at least 450,000 or 7.5 per cent",63
NA,of the work force in 1978. This is what the,63
NA,Party has been saying. The Bureau provides the,63
NA,Prime Minister's preferred index. He rubbishes,63
NA,the Commonwealth Employment Service's,63
NA,figures. He says that they are unreliable. The,63
NA,Minister for Employment and Industrial Rela-,63
NA,"tions, Mr Street, when releasing the August un-",63
NA,"employment statistics last Friday, claimed that",63
NA,'unemployment during the month declined in,63
NA,line with the normal seasonal pattern'. He,63
NA,claimed in July that 'there was no clearly evident,63
NA,pattern in the labour market' during that month.,63
NA,The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics,63
NA,seasonally adjusted series refutes the Minister's,63
NA,claim.,63
NA,"Unemployment, in seasonally adjusted terms,",63
NA,"is now running at 355,000 or 5.7 per cent ofthe",63
NA,"work force. It is 60,700 more than it was 12",63
NA,"months ago. In seasonally adjusted terms, unem-",63
NA,ployment has been increasing in each quarter of,63
NA,this year. The position is most serious for young,63
NA,the people between the ages of 15 and 19 years; 16.7,63
NA,"per cent of them cannotfindwork; 37,000 young",63
NA,people are still looking for theirfirstjob. That is,63
NA,an increase of more than 700 over thefigurefor,63
NA,"the last quarter, at a time when the normal",63
NA,the seasonal pattern should show a decline. Instead,63
NA,"of positive action, the Government feeds specu-",63
NA,lation about an early election. Ministers attempt,63
NA,to inflame the uranium debate. The Prime Mims-,63
NA,ter tries to intimidate the ConciUation and Arbi-,63
NA,tration Commission and the Industries Assist-,63
NA,"ance Commission. He blames the unions,",63
NA,although the Statistician yesterday released,63
NA,which show that the number of industrial,63
NA,disputes in June was fewer than it has been for 6,63
NA,years.,63
NA,Australia needs a job-led recovery. Without,63
NA,leadership the Uves of generations of,63
NA,"people wUl be bUghted, just as an earUer",63
NA,"generation was bUghted in the Great Depression,",63
NA,of which I was a victim. In my electorate of,63
NA,"in Cessnock, the unemployment rate",63
NA,among youth is approximately 14 per cent. These,63
NA,young people could develop a sense of being no-,63
NA,body. They lose their pride. They lose their per-,63
NA,sonahty. Is it any wonder that some of them drift,63
NA,them towards crime and drugs? The Government,63
NA,came into power with the sole intention of curing,63
NA,to the twin evtis of inflation and unemployment. It,63
NA,faded in its attempt to cure both these evils,63
NA,that rack Australia today. As the Australian,63
NA,"Financial Review, our most respected economic",63
NA,"journal, which, in my view, frequently writes as",63
NA,"the impartially as any other newspaper, declared in",63
NA,editorial quite recently that mflation is vir-,63
NA,tuaUy shoved on the doorstep of the Arbitration,63
NA,Labor Commission. Unemployment is ignored. As a,63
NA,"result of this Budget, the number of unemployed",64
NA,"will exceed 400,000 by Christmas of this year,",64
NA,"and inflauon, on the Government's admission,",64
NA,will be at least as high as it was previously.,64
NA,The amazing thing is that people have,64
NA,trumpeting this Budget as an election winner.,64
NA,Are not we entided to ask: Who will benefit from,64
NA,it? The only people who will benefit from it,64
NA,be those already well off and secure in their,64
NA,jobs- a handful of people on the highest dollars,64
NA,"incomes. Rich people-th e Prime Minister,",64
NA,"Fraser, included-wil l gain more in take-home",64
NA,pay each week than the majority of taxpayers,64
NA,ceive in their total weekly earnings. For the,64
NA,majority of people the so-called tax cuts are,64
NA,cruel fraud. Most of them make a gain of less,64
NA,"than $3 a week, which is pitiful by comparison",64
NA,with the handouts to the wealthy. It will be,64
NA,immediately swallowed up by the higher price,64
NA,petrol and byrisinginflation.,64
NA,This is a budget prepared by the wealthy for,64
NA,"the wealthy. As Bob Hawke said, it is a pentunfair",64
NA,"house budget, conceived in a penthouse and economic",64
NA,directed to benefit those who occupy the pentmembers of,64
NA,houses of this country. Real government spendof the Press. the,64
NA,ing has been cut by nearly 2 per cent. Combined a scapegoat for,64
NA,"with the cut of about 4 per cent last year, this will ing the problems",64
NA,"direcdy reduce employment opportunities, partraUan people today.",64
NA,ticularly in the depressed building,64
NA,"tion industries. Reducing the rate of inflation is headed 'Bench is ""useful"" out",64
NA,supposed to be the Government's,64
NA,"the mcrease in petrol taxes, on top of unnecess-",64
NA,ary devaluations and the destructive changes to,64
NA,"Medibank, will guarantee another year of rapid whipping-boy",64
NA,price increases. Inflation will be at a rate of at,64
NA,least 12 per cent this year. Real earnings will fall.,64
NA,The purchasing power of family allowances will the,64
NA,be reduced. The net effect of reduced,64
NA,and family allowances and the tax changes will,64
NA,be to cut the purchasing power of our incomes,64
NA,several dollars a week.,64
NA,Most dishonest of all is the Government's,64
NA,broken promises on tax indexation. Mr Lynch,64
NA,has continually promised full tax indexation.,64
NA,in this Budget half tax indexation is announced,64
NA,for a so-called transitional period which lasts,64
NA,until 30 June 1979. Instead of stimulating the,64
NA,economy and expanding employment opporan impartial way.,64
NA,"tunities, the Government's excessive concessions",64
NA,to those already well off will increase the,64
NA,numbers who cannot get jobs. About $800m of,64
NA,potential company tax receipts is being given,64
NA,this year. The special youth employment training,64
NA,program will cost $18m. While mining comaction.,64
NA,"panies receive concessions, small business",64
NA,suffers. The rural community is ignored.,64
NA,In the Parhament today the Government took,64
NA,another step towards reducing the export levy on,64
NA,coal. This will prove a bonanza to the major,64
NA,multi-national coal compames which are operat-,64
NA,ing in this country. It will be to the tune of well,64
NA,been over $100m. Yet the honourable member for,64
NA,Casey a shorttimeago had the temerity to say,64
NA,that we were pricing our way out of world mar-,64
NA,will kets. If Utah Mining Australia Ltd and Ciutha,64

NA,Mr age of Austrahan coal to overseas markets by,64

NA,give the Labor Party Opposition onlyfiveminour,65
NA,utes notice of its intention to bring in this,65
NA,lation. The Government looks for scapegoats,65
NA,which it can blame for the problems which it,65
NA,"should shoulder. In industrial disputation, as",65
NA,said a shorttimeago and as revealed by the,65
NA,"reau of Statistics, the strike rate",65
NA,"June, July and August was the lowest for six",65
NA,years. So the Government is trying to blame,65
NA,everyone but itself for its economic ills. It also,65
NA,"commg under severe and, in my view, justifiable",65
NA,criticism for its attitude towards education. The,65
NA,Sydney Morning Herald a shorttimeago carried,65
NA,an article under the heading 'Commission and,65
NA,"Government clash over school funds'. It was themselves,",65
NA,referring to the Schools Commission. The article,65
NA,read as follows:,65

NA,The Government intends again to subsidise,65
NA,some of the most wealthy schools,65

NA,"us, the Budget Debate is the one time of the year",65
NA,when members can speak in this chamber about,65
NA,virtually anything they hke related to governcatastrophes,65

NA,of the Budget that it touches almost all aspects,65
NA,daily lives. Ifindit a pity that more members,65

NA,"can do so very easily, all we need is the wtil-th e",65
NA,recognition that either we stand together or we,65
NA,of this countiy wUl fall together.,65
NA,That is why I regret that the Opposition during,65
NA,"this Budget debate-indeed , during the Ufe of",65
NA,this Parliament-ha s been negative and obstruc-,65
NA,to protionist. It has looked back in surly anger rather,65
NA,eduthan forward and constructively. The contribu-,65
NA,tions to this debate by the Leader of the Oppo-,65
NA,sition ( Mr E. G. Whitlam) and his two economic,65
NA,by rejecttutors-th e honourable members for Adelaide,65
NA,on ( Mr Hurford) and for Oxley ( Mr Hayden) were,65
NA,the worst I have ever heard from any three top,65
NA,parUamentary leaders from any party hi my,65
NA,experience. Not one of them showed any,65
NA,awareness of the real facts of our present econ-,65
NA,situation and the background to it. Not one,65
NA,looked forward to the future. Not one of,65
NA,any positive suggestion as to how,65
NA,a better AustraUa. Most sadly,65
NA,them any appreciation,65
NA,"aspirations, of the Aus-",65
NA,housing for Abortralian people.,65
NA,The best they could do collectively was to sug-,65
NA,Parliagest more and more government spending-,65
NA,of more and more of the same old medicine with,65
NA,they bedevtiled AustraUa between 1973,65
NA,"1975, medicine which led to a fourfold",65
NA,"increase in inflation, to the loss of countless thou-",65
NA,"sands of jobs in productive activity, to a 150 per",65
NA,cent increase in unemployment in 18 months,65
NA,to a massive loss of consumer and investor,65
NA,"confidence, to the near destruction of the manu-",65
NA,"facturing and rural sectors, to a legacy of other",65
NA,which brought this nation and its,65
NA,people to their knees. Not once did these giants,65
NA,of of the so called alternative government make a,65
NA,constructive suggestion. Not once did they ac-,66
NA,knowledge what the Fraser Government has,66
NA,achieved in the short space of 21 months of,66
NA,government. Not once did they make any recog-,66
NA,nition of the underlying strength of this Budget,66
NA,as a major cornerstone in the continuing recovery,66
NA,of the Austrahan economy- a recovery which is,66
NA,underway and which promises to make 1978 a,66
NA,better year for all AustraUans.,66
NA,What are the achievements of this Governpension,66
NA,"ment? Let me list just a few of them, because",66
NA,today I want to look forward rather than,66
NA,ward. Some of the achievements are worth,66
NA,restating because unfortunately not enough increase,66
NA,people seem to be aware of them. The overriding,66
NA,achievement has been the reduction in mflation.,66
NA,The Fraser Government won office in 1975 for,66
NA,"many reasons, but none more important than for",66
NA,its pledge to attach No. 1 priority to this issue.,66
NA,"the 21 months since this Government took office,",66
NA,the underlying rate of inflation in AustraUa,66
NA,fallen by more than 40 per cent-fro m 16.7 per,66
NA,cent to approximately 10 per cent. Indicators,66
NA,published m the past few days indeed suggest,66
NA,that we are now back to single digit inflation.,66
NA,Inflation is still too high. But I assert without,66
NA,any fear of contradiction that had the Fraser,66
NA,Government not won office in December 1975,66
NA,the present rate of inflation under a Whitlam,66
NA,government would now have been in excess of,66
NA,20 per cent. Just think what that would have,66
NA,done to the economic and social fibre of this,66
NA,country. Not only would inflation have for,66
NA,"skyrocketed, so also would have unemployment.",66
NA,Unemployment has increased since the present,66
NA,Government came into office. The increase has,66
NA,"been about 1 per cent of the work force-or ,",66
NA,"put it in another way, there has been approxitools",66
NA,mately a 25 per cent increase in the number of,66
NA,persons unemployed. In the last 18 months of,66
NA,Whitlam Government unemployment increased,66
NA,by 150 per cent.,66
NA,Mr MCLean-Ho w much?,66
Mr SHORT,By 150 per cent. Had that people?,66
NA,Government stayed in office unemployment,66
NA,could by now have reached a level of some,66
NA,"cent of the work force, compared with the",66
NA,presentfigureof some 5 h per cent. In the 21,66
NA,"months since the Fraser Government won office,",66
NA,there has been positive growth in the economytaken,66
NA,growth which is of fundamental importance if,66
NA,the living standards of Australians are to be,66
NA,improved in Une with the aspirations of Ausits,66
NA,"tralians. By contrast, in the last 18 months of",66
NA,Labor Government real output in Austraha fell,66
NA,by some 5 per cent. So by most tests the Govern-,66
NA,ment's comparative overaU economic record has,66
NA,been good since it assumed office.,66
NA,Let us now have a brief look at what the,66
NA,Fraser Government has done for people. For the,66
NA,"low income earner with a large famtiy, the",66
NA,Government's famtiy allowance system has pro-,66
NA,vided the greatest boost for very many years. For,66
NA,"the pensioner, the Government's decision to tie",66
NA,increases automatically to increases in,66
NA,the cost of living has provided security to pen-,66
NA,backsioners for thefirsttime in our history.,66
NA,"For the unemployed, there has been a major",66
NA,in retraining and other schemes to better,66
NA,equip these persons for re-entry to the work,66
NA,force. Unemployment is a major problem. It is,66
NA,"not a problem that wtil go away quickly or easily,",66
NA,even when the overall rate of economic recovery,66
NA,In picks up. It must not be turned into a poUtical,66
NA,footbaU the way the Labor Party is attempting. It,66
NA,has is much too serious for that. Human life and,66
NA,human dignity are at stake. The problem must be,66
NA,"analysed logically yet compassionately, and",66
NA,logical yet compassionate solutions found. That,66
NA,requires co-operation and constructive effort on,66
NA,all sides-no t the negative obstructionism and,66
NA,politicking in which the Opposition is engaging.,66
NA,We must foUow the lead of the present,66
NA,Government and take a fresh look at labour mar-,66
NA,"ket poUcies, giving much more emphasis than in",66
NA,the past to breaking down the underlying struc-,66
NA,tural barriers that are such an important reason,66
NA,"much of our present unemployment, particu-",66
NA,larly amongst the unskUled and the young. We,66
NA,must make sure that young students are being,66
NA,adequately equipped with such basic tools as the,66
NA,to abUity to read and write and spell adequately-,66
NA,which many school leavers today appear to,66
NA,lack. We must ensure that different forms of edu-,66
NA,the cation pay full regard to future vocational,66
NA,prospects and that we as a community obtain the,66
NA,best value we can for the money-ou r money as,66
NA,taxpayers-spen t on education.,66
NA,What else has the Government done for,66
NA,"For the aged, it has greatly increased the",66
NA,amount of accommodation being built. For,66
NA,"8 per handicapped children, it has made major",66
NA,improvements in the allowances paid to their,66
NA,"parents or guardians. For the farmer, it has res-",66
NA,x,66
NA,tored some of the necessary assistance that was,66
NA,away by the Whitlam Government-an d,66
NA,taken away at a time when that Government was,66
NA,hellbent on destroying rural producers through,66
NA,reckless approach to economic management,66
NA,the and its complete disregard for the inflationary,66
NA,"consequences of its actions. For the farmer also,",66
NA,the introduction of income equalisation deposits,67
NA,and the new tax averaging arrangements will,67
NA,"prove of major benefit, in both the short and",67
NA,longer terms. On top of that there have been thelarge,67
NA,Government's actions in restructuring the Aushave,67
NA,"tralian Meat Board, in introducing major",67
NA,changes designed to improve the situation in,67
NA,"dairy industry, in increasing the floor price for",67
NA,"wool, in the impending establishment of a rural",67
NA,"bank, and many more.",67
NA,"For all income earning Australians, the desirable.",67
NA,"introduction of tax indexation last year, and the",67
NA,taxation reforms announced in this Budget,67
NA,"already produced, so far as indexation is",67
NA,"cerned, and will produce, so far as the new",67
NA,"scales are concerned, major income tax relief.",67
NA,Every Australian personal income taxpayer,67
NA,received a cut in taxation on 1 July this year.,67
NA,Every AustraUan personal income taxpayer wtil,67
NA,receive another cut hi taxation on 1 February,67
NA,"next, a sttil further cut on 1 July 1978, and",67
NA,"annual cuts, depending on the rate of mflation,",67
NA,every year thereafter. Despite some misunderpsychology.,67
NA,"standings about the Government's initial presencourse,",67
NA,tation of these taxation reduction measures and,67
NA,"despite what the Opposition may say, it is a fact",67
NA,that these measures represent major reductions,67
NA,"in taxation. 'As a package, they represent",67
NA,most far-reaching beneficial changes to our,67
NA,sonal income tax system in our historyPty,67
NA,beneficial to each and every personal income,67
NA,taxpayer in AustraUa.,67
NA,Time does not permit me to catalogue further,67
NA,the impressive Ust of the Fraser Government's,67
NA,achievements. Many of them were introduced,67
NA,before the 1977 Budget. Some were introduced,67
NA,in the Budget. Others have been introduced,67
NA,"since. A Budget, no matter how important it may",67
NA,"be, is only one of a host of complex economic dewell",67
NA,cisions that are taken in the course of a year.,67
NA,must therefore be careful not to get the Budget,67
NA,"out of perspective. That said, however, a Budget",67
NA,does tend to set the basicfiscaland monetary,67
NA,"framework for the economy in the year ahead, at",67
NA,least in those areas of policy for which governtion,67
NA,ment has responsibUity. The framework profidence,67
NA,vided by the 1977 Budget is sound. It is responinflation.,67
NA,sible. It is forward looking and innovatory.,67
NA,The deficit for 1977-78 has been reduced,67
NA,some $500m below last year's outturn. That wtil,67
NA,"be anti-inflationary. EquaUy important, though,",67
NA,it should provide the scope for a downward,67
NA,movement in interest rates as the year,67
NA,"progresses, and therefore an easing of the cripirresponsibtiity.",67
NA,pling interest and repayment burden facing,67
NA,"thousands of individuals and companies, parwtil",67
NA,ticularly small businesses. This in turn should,67
NA,have an expansionary effect on economic ac-,67
NA,tivity. But the Government will need to be ex-,67
NA,thetremely careful in its interest rate pohcy. Too,67
NA,an interest rate reduction too quickly could,67
NA,damaging effects on money markets. It also,67
NA,could have undesirable consequences for the,67
NA,the exchange rate for the AustraUan doUar; and it,67
NA,"could cause a resurgence of inflation. But, prop-",67
NA,"erly managed, I amfirmlyconvinced that a sus-",67
NA,tainable reduction in interest rates during,67
NA,1977-78 is not only possible but also highly,67
NA,have The forecasts for growth of gross domestic,67
NA,"conproduct, and for unemployment, contained in",67
NA,rate the Budget documents are not particularly,67
NA,cheerful- a 2 per cent year-on-year growth in,67
NA,"real GDP, and Uttle or no change in unemploy-",67
NA,ment. Their impUcations for productivity are also,67
NA,worrying. One cannot Ughtly dismiss sophisti-,67
NA,"cated econometric forecasts. On the other hand,",67
NA,these forecasts do not take into account non-,67
NA,quantifiable factors such as consumer or investor,67
NA,"The significance of these is, of",67
NA,as much a matter of subjective judgment,67
NA,as anything else. My own subjective judgment is,67
NA,that the forecasts may well turn out to be pes-,67
NA,"simistic, at least so far as real GDP growth is con-",67
NA,"the cerned. Other commentators, including W. D.",67
NA,"perScott and Co. Pty Ltd, Phtiip Shrapnel and Co.",67
NA,"Ltd and the Commercial Bank of AustraUa,",67
NA,"for example, appear to share this view.",67
NA,"Above all else, the Government wUl need to be",67
NA,Ught on its feet in its economic management dur-,67
NA,ing 1977-78. This appUes particularly to monet-,67
NA,ary poUcy. The growth in money supply may,67
NA,well need to exceed the 8 per cent to 10 per cent,67
NA,targeted for hi the Budget Speech. The Treasurer,67
NA,( Mr Lynch) has indicated clearly that he is very,67
NA,aware of this. But although it will need to be,67
NA,"WeUght on its feet, there are several objectives that",67
NA,the Government will move away from only at,67
NA,"great risk to its basic strategy. The main on is, of",67
NA,"course, maintenance of the exchange rate at",67
NA,about its existing level. Any significant devalua-,67
NA,of the doUar would be a major blow to con-,67
NA,and a major blow to thefightagainst,67
NA,In that context the recent remarks of the,67
NA,"to honourable member for Oxley, speculating",67
NA,"about the future of the dollar, should be de-",67
NA,plored by aU thinking members on both sides of,67
NA,the House. Corning from the Opposition's main,67
NA,"economic spokesman, Ifindthem the height of",67
NA,If we stay on the broad course,67
NA,"now charted by the Government, we not only",67
NA,see continuing improvement in the economy,67
NA,over 1977-78 but also wtil have continued to lay,67
NA,the foundations for steady and sustainable econfact.,68
NA,omic growth into the 1980s.,68
NA,It is to this latter issue that I want to,68
NA,"time remaining to me. We in Austraha, as in",68
NA,"many other countries of the Western world,",68
NA,appear to be suffering some crisis of confidence-,68
NA,not only in our governments but also in ourselves,68
NA,as individuals. Why is there a crisis of confidence,68
NA,"in government-no t the Government, but the",68
NA,institution of government itself? The reasons,68
NA,viously are many and varied. But the reason,68
NA,place top of my list is that we as individuals over,68
NA,many years now have come to rely on governimate,68
NA,"ment far too much, in a way which has made",68
NA,quite impossible for any government to Uve up,68
NA,community expectations. We have tended to say,68
NA,to ourselves that if we want something we wUl,68
NA,"run along to government first, rather",68
NA,sider what we might be able to do to help our-,68
NA,selves. There must be a limit to what we ask,68
NA,government to do for us. Government can,68
NA,only so much. It has a basic responsibUity to,68
NA,determine the parameters within which our,68
NA,economy and our community function. It has,68
NA,basic responsibUity to assist those in our comsituation,68
NA,munity who are most in need. It also has a reage,68
NA,sponsibUity to give a lead to community thinking,68
NA,and community attitudes. It has a responsibUity,68
NA,"to reflect and to react to community attitudes,",68
NA,in fact these can be determined. But at the end,68
NA,"the day it is our actions and our attitudes,",68
NA,"individuals, which wUl determine how Australia",68
NA,"develops economically, socially and morally.",68
NA,We need a fresh attitude on mind in this government,68
NA,country. We need to regenerate our confidence. signal,68
NA,We need to be less self seeking and to think moredamental importance,68
NA,of others. We need to get away from confronin our vast continent.,68
NA,tation and back to co-operation. But we can do moved courageously andThe,68
NA,this only if all sections of our community are these areas. It has beenresponsibly,68
NA,genuinely prepared to co-operate. Without,68
NA,"sincerity in this regard, attempts at co-operation remarks today have been phUosophical.ofSome",68
NA,"wUl lead only to appeasement and, to a victory",68
NA,for industrial or economic muscle over the less,68
NA,organised and weaker sections of the comsay,68
NA,munity. I beheve that as a community we need,68
NA,be prepared to see government,68
NA,role in the total scheme of things. We need,68
NA,courage poUtical parties to that end. The,68
NA,"traUan Labor Party, however, is fundamentally",68
NA,opposed to this concept. It is unashamedly-thi s,68
NA,is pubhcly admitted and accepted- a party,68
NA,government. It beheves that government knows Hindmarsh.,68
NA,better than the people what is best for those,68
NA,people. It believes that it can spend people's,68
NA,money more effectively and more wisely than the,68
NA,people themselves. Let us never forget this basic,68
NA,There is a major difference between the pol-,68
NA,itical philosophies of the two major parties on,68
NA,this issue.,68
NA,turn in the The Fraser Government has taken a major,68
NA,lead in restoring incentive to AustraUans. It has,68
NA,reformed the taxation system so as to leave more,68
NA,income in the hands of people and to aUow them,68
NA,to choose how they spend this income. It has taU-,68
NA,ored health and social welfare policies so that,68
NA,they cater for the needy rather than for those,68
NA,obwho can more easUy provide for themselves.,68
NA,I There is more that it needs to do. It must cut,68
NA,down on the regulations and restrictions on legit-,68
NA,business activity which have grown up,68
NA,it over the years. It must recognise more the,68
NA,to differences between big business and small busi-,68
NA,"ness, and take account of these in its pohcies,",68
NA,particularly in relation to the avaUabUity of,68
NA,than confinance for small businesses.,68
NA,It must encourage a wage fixing system which,68
NA,do pays full regard to the need to reward pro-,68
NA,"ductivity, effort and scarce skUls-rathe r than a",68
NA,system m which wages are determined without,68
NA,"a regard for these factors, which is broadly the",68
NA,under wage indexation. It must encour-,68
NA,progressive reform of the trade union move-,68
NA,ment. Here I have in mind particularly the need,68
NA,for the development of industry unions rather,68
NA,if than the fragmented union structure we now,68
NA,ofhave. It must elevate decentraUsation to the level,68
NA,as of a major national objective. The Government,68
NA,"has made a smaU, but highly significant, step in",68
NA,this direction in the Budget by allocating $6m for,68
NA,general decentralisation purposes. This is the,68
NA,first time to my knowledge that any Federal,68
NA,has taken such a step. I hope it is a,68
NA,that,68
NA,the Government recognises the fun-,68
NA,of greater decentralisation,68
NA,Government has,68
NA,in many of,68

NA,"ter, against the ConcUiation and Arbitration",69
NA,Commission for being responsible for wage,69
NA,"increases which occurred, particularly in further",69
NA,1973-74. The record proves that the Arbitration,69
NA,Commission was not responsible for them.,69
NA,Mr King-I t was the Labor Government.,69
Mr CLYDE CAMERON,The Labor them.,69
NA,Government had nothing to do with the wage,69
NA,increases which occurred in private industry,69
NA,1973-74. They came about as a consequence,69
NA,agreements made between the unions and the,69
NA,private employers. Private employers were able,69
NA,to offer increased wages because they knew thatsorts,69
NA,they could simply pass the increases on to a,69
NA,goods hungry public who were wtiling to pay them.,69
NA,whatever price was asked for the goods they,69
NA,needed so badly at a time when they were getting,69
NA,for the first time in their Uves the money,69
NA,needed to buy them. The Prices Justification,69
NA,bunal should have more accurately monitored,69
NA,the effect of increased wages which were given,69
NA,under sweetheart agreements in order that the their,69
NA,price increases could be passed on so that these,69
NA,excessive demands should not have had to be,69
NA,paid by the rest of the people.,69
NA,I remember an occasion when the Amal-,69
NA,gamated Metal Workers Union asked me to sup-,69
NA,port an appUcation before the PJT for an,69
NA,mcrease in the price of products of Comalco Ltd,69
NA,or Alcoa of AustraUa Ltd- I am not sure which. I,69
NA,told the official of the AMWU bluntly that I,69
NA,would not be a party to any policy that would,69
NA,allow selected groups to give specially increased,69
NA,wages to atinyhandful of workers and pass the,69
NA,increases on to the others. I am sorry to say that,69
NA,own Government went before the Prices Jus-,69
NA,to tification Tribunal and actually supported an,69
NA,in the price of steel by Broken Htil Pro-,69
NA,prietary Co. Ltd at a time when I was being told,69
NA,as Minister for Labour that we ought to be talcing,69
NA,a more active part before the ConciUation and,69
NA,Arbitration Commission against increases in,69
NA,prices. The fact is that the Conciliation and Arbi-,69
NA,by tration Commission had nothing to do with the,69
NA,increases in wages which occurred in 1973-74. It,69
NA,"a bystander, a spectator standing on the",69
NA,"sidelines, unable to do anything about them. No",69
NA,of one bothered to go to the Conciliation and Arbi-,69
NA,will go on blamtration Commission.,69
NA,It is true that the AustraUan PubUc Service,69
NA,arBoard offered very substantial increases to the,69
NA,servants which had a marked effect upon,69
NA,levels outside. It offered a 12 per cent,69
NA,to second and third division officers and,69
NA,beta 16 per cent increase to the people whom I,69
NA,describe correctly as the fat cats of the PubUc,69
NA,Service. The next year the Board offered a,69
NA,"increase. These offers, made without the",69
NA,"authority or approval of the Cabinet, were the",69
NA,principal reason that the wage escalation,69
NA,occurred. We can no longer give massive,69
NA,increases to the Public Service and expect people,69
NA,outside the PubUc Service not to want to try to,69
NA,match them. They have everyrightto match,69
NA,If taxpayers are put in a position where,69
NA,they have to give their pubUc servants more,69
NA,"in money, better superannuation schemes and aU",69
NA,of kinds of recreational schemes they have every,69
NA,right to expect the same benefits themselves. If,69
NA,the pubUc cannot afford to give themselves these,69
NA,"of benefits, the pubUc servants who are sup-",69
NA,posed to serve the pubUc have no right to ask for,69
NA,We should not Uve in a situation in which we,69
NA,they are governed by a group of modern mandarins,69
NA,Triwho expect everything from the public purse for,69
NA,themselves and expect everybody outside to put,69
NA,up with wages which are infinitely lower than,69
NA,own. It is a terrible crime in the name ofjus-,69
NA,tice that metal workers are getting less money,69
NA,now than a Class 4 clerk in the Commonwealth,69
NA,PubUc Service. It is a travesty of wage justice that,69
NA,a toolmaker should be getting $60 a week less,70
NA,than a Class 2/3 clerk in the Pubhc Service.,70
NA,know Class 4 clerks who are no more than 23 isation,70
NA,"years of age and are earning about $10,000",70
NA,year. That cannot go on. It has to end. If,70
NA,able members want to see the real cause of,70
NA,wage spiral in that year they should,70
NA,direction in which I am now pointing.,70
NA,The claim that wage increases in the private,70
NA,sector have been responsible for inflation and,70
NA,unemployment does not stand up to critical is,70
NA,analysis. If wage levels have anything to do with,70
NA,the levels of mflation and unemployment we pany;,70
NA,should now have a lower level of inflauon and aabeing,70
NA,higher level of employment than we had two now,70
NA,years ago. The level of real wages has fallen by exchanges,70
NA,more than 6 per cent since this Government price of $5.60.,70
NA,came to office less than two years ago. If this ar-,70
NA,gument is sound the reduction of about 6.2,70
NA,cent in real wages should have brought about,70
NA,reduction in inflation and an increase in employleviathan.,70
NA,ment. It has done neither. If low wages would,70
NA,"solve unemployment and inflation, how is it",70
NA,levels of inflation and unemployment in low,70
NA,"wage countries such as Mexico, India, Pakistan,",70
NA,"Bangladesh, Brazil, Indonesia and the PhUippany",70
NA,pines-on e could go on and on selecting the,70
NA,wage countries of the world-ar e higher than,70
NA,they are here?,70
NA,The causes of inflation are not hard to find.,70
NA,There is not one single cause. In the financial,70
NA,pages of the daily Press record profits are,70
NA,announced every day of the week. I challenge,70
NA,anybody to produce for me a daUy newspaper,70
NA,for any day of last year in wbich there was not an,70
NA,announcement of a record profit for some comcharges,70
NA,"pany or another, usuaUy the AustraUan subsidimdustry",70
NA,ary of some multinational corporation whose,70
NA,"board rooms in places like New York, Too",70
NA,"Stockholm, London or Amsterdam govern the",70
NA,poUcies and prices of the company. Excessive,70
NA,"profits, price transfers to parent transnational,",70
NA,high interest charges and indirect taxation,70
NA,the main causes of inflation. The increase in the,70
NA,"price of petrol, which this Government has",70
NA,deUberately brought about with its eyes wide,70
NA,"open, wUl increase the consumer price index by 1technology.",70
NA,per cent and that will immediately impose upon,70
NA,mdustry an increase in wages of $2 a week for,70
NA,everybody on average weekly earnings.,70
NA,Not only is inflation affected by these,70
NA,"influences, employment is affected by them",70
NA,well. Unemployment is also partly due to,70
NA,inefficient management. Honourable members,70
NA,talk about inefficient labour. I assert now that,70
NA,management in AustraUa is about the most country,70
NA,inefficient of any part ofthe highly industrialised,70
NA,world. AustraUa is notorious for its bad manage-,70
NA,I ment. Management here has no idea of rational-,70
NA,ofits industry. I point to one ofthe biggest,70
NA,"a and oldest companies in AustraUa, the Broken",70
NA,"honourHU1 Pty Co. Ltd, which is one of the worst",70
NA,the managed companies in AustraUa. For years it,70
NA,look in the was managed by alcoholics.,70
NA,Mr MCLean-Oh !,70
Mr CLYDE CAMERON,Do not laugh. BHP,70
NA,badly managed and I do not care whether,70
NA,honourable members have shares in that com-,70
NA,they are being robbed. If their shares were,70
NA,properly managed they would be receivmg,70
NA,much bigger dividend than they are receiving,70
NA,and the price for BHP shares on the stock,70
NA,would be greater than the present,70
per Mr HAYDEN ,I t is an inefficient leviathan.,70
Mr CLYDE CAMERON,I t is an inefficient,70
NA,That is the expression used by the,70
NA,honourable member for Oxley and I agree with,70
NA,that that. It is an inbred management. Top manage-,70
NA,ment people are not brought in from outside,70
NA,BHP. They have to come up through the com-,70
NA,as do public servants. The company does,70
NA,low not get any new bright ideas. MCLennan will be,70
NA,succeeded by somebody else who wiU be just,70
NA,about as outdated as the man he succeeded.,70
NA,What is true of BHP is true of many other com-,70
NA,pames in AustraUa as well. I believe that industry,70
NA,needs to be rationalised. It needs to be updated,70
NA,"so that throughput can be increased, so that over-",70
NA,head can be reduced. What is also very impor-,70
NA,tant is a reduction in interest rates. It is interest,70
NA,as much as anything else that are killing,70
NA,in Australia today. We need a greater,70
NA,use of modern technology than we now have.,70
NA,many of our industries are trying to continue,70
NA,"with outdated machinery, outdated technology.",70
NA,We should be spending more time seeing what,70
NA,kind of technology is avaUable to industry in,70
NA,"are countries such as West Germany, the United",70
NA,"States, even the Soviet Union, Italy and France.",70
NA,But we do nothing about that. The Government,70
NA,does nothing to encourage the inflow of modern,70
NA,It is no use having modern technology if we do,70
NA,not have technologists and technicians to operate,70
NA,it. It is no use having modern laser machinery in,70
NA,this country if we do not have people to operate,70
NA,as it. We ought to spend more money on technical,70
NA,"education, on teaching people to become tech-",70
NA,"nicians and technologists, and a lot less money",70
NA,on universities. I am sick and tired of seeing this,70
NA,spending hundreds of mUlions of dollars,70
NA,"on universities, teaching people to be good at",70
NA,"arithmetic, algebra or something else but know-",71
NA,ing absolutely nothing at all about productivity,71
NA,or about how to make this country tick. Such,71
NA,"people can tell us all about the moon, they can",71
NA,"tell us about the stars, they can tell us how many",71
NA,"cells there are in a sour sob bug, but they cannot",71
NA,tell us anything about industry or how to make,71
NA,this country more productive and more competi-,71
NA,tive. We need to expand the level of employment,71
NA,in tertiary fields.,71
NA,In countries such as the Soviet Union and the,71
NA,"United States they have now discovered that,",71
NA,with the rapid pace of Ufe we are living towards,71
NA,"the end of the century, they need a big influx of",71
NA,psychologists if people are to be able to handle,71
NA,the pace oflife. But what are we doing? We have,71
NA,"some psychologists, but not enough. We have",71
NA,"some social workers, but not enough. We need",71
NA,more people to provide child care facUities for,71
NA,the mothers of this country. More money needs,71
NA,to be spent on recreation. It is not necessary for,71
NA,the whole of our work force to be out there shov-,71
NA,elling dung. They do not all have to spend their,71
NA,Uves that way. There are more ways of earning a,71
NA,Uving than that. We have to commence an,71
NA,expansion in the tertiary level because the sec-,71
NA,ondary industries are dropping rapidly in their,71
NA,capacity to employ as technology comes into,71
NA,being.,71
NA,What we need more than anything else and we,71
NA,need it urgently-I eventually persuaded the,71
NA,Government of which I was a member to agree,71
NA,to it but nothing more has been done about it-i s,71
NA,to set up a bureau of labour economics for the,71
NA,purpose of making period projections of labour,71
NA,needs right up to the year 2000 at least. The,71
NA,Americans are doing it and the Russians are,71
NA,doing it but we have done nothing at all. If one,71
NA,went to the Department of Employment and,71
NA,Industrial Relations and asked how many com-,71
NA,puter experts would be needed in six years time,71
NA,they would probably want to know what a com-,71
NA,puter expert was. They would not be able to say,71
NA,what would be the needs in thattime.We need to,71
NA,"have facUities, and this can only be done by a",71
NA,"properly organised bureau of labour economics,",71
NA,which would be able to tell young people what,71
NA,vocational options are avaUable to them. IBM,71
NA,"has a machine now which, if the various factors",71
NA,important for determining vocational opportuni-,71
NA,"ties are fed in, such as the background, the",71
NA,"parents background, their educational capacity",71
NA,"and so forth, can come up with as many as 400",71
NA,different options. Probably 350 of those options,71
NA,would be vocations of which neither the parents,71
NA,nor the chUd had ever heard. This is what we,71
NA,need.,71
NA,We need this bureau to measure the trend and,71
NA,the incidence of industrial accidents and occu-,71
NA,pational diseases. Honourable members op-,71
NA,"posite talk about strikes, but we are losing twice",71
NA,as many man days through accidents and dis-,71
NA,eases in industry which could be avoided. The,71
NA,only good thing I can ever say about BHP is that,71
NA,it has reduced the incidence of industrial acci-,71
NA,dents and disease from 95 points to 15 points. If,71
NA,an inefficient industry like BHP canreducethe,71
NA,"level of the incidence of accidents to that level,",71
NA,others ought to be able to do it as well. Honour-,71
NA,"able members opposite talk about productivity,",71
NA,but nobody knows the productivity trends in,71
NA,Australia today. If we had a productivity index,71
NA,for increasing wages to compensate for increased,71
NA,productivity no one would know where to start.,71
NA,They would not know what the starting point of,71
NA,the productivity bonus scheme would be because,71
NA,nobody knows the productivity. We need to be,71
NA,able to measure year by year the productivity in,71
NA,"Australia as a whole, the productivity industry by",71
NA,mdustry and branch by branch of industry. Un-,71
NA,less we do that we have no chance whatever of,71
NA,competing.,71
NA,Part of the cause of unemployment is buyer,71
NA,resistance. We reached market saturation for the,71
NA,upper and middle classes of people during the,71
NA,1973-1974 years of economic buoyancy. The,71
NA,people who have needs to be satisfied now are,71
NA,not receiving the incomes necessary to meet their,71
NA,needs. The wrong people are benefiting from the,71
NA,"Government's fiscal policy. Some 330,000",71
NA,potential buyers of the goods that the factories in,71
NA,Australia want to sell have no income except,71
NA,social service handouts. A proper coal export,71
NA,levy on Utah and the other coal exporters would,71
NA,have yielded an extra $200m in revenue each,71
NA,year. But that was not done. Instead of increasing,71
NA,"the levy, as should have been done, this Govern-",71
NA,ment reduced the levy. Whom did it help?,71
NA,Nobody but the wealthy Utah Development,71
NA,Company and the foreign owned multinational,71
NA,corporations which now have control of our vast,71
NA,resources.,71
NA,The Government could have done more to en-,71
NA,courage a manpower training program. It did,71
NA,nothing at all about that. A consumer-led,71
NA,recovery is our only hope for getting increased,71
NA,employment. But that calls for a higher level of,71
NA,income for those who are most likely to spend it,71
NA,on consumer goods-th e 64 per cent of the work,71
NA,force who are not getting the average weekly,71
NA,earnings. Of course we know that hfe was not,71
NA,meant to be easy. It is not meant to be easy even,71
NA,"for therich.They have to put up with an 8,000",71
NA,acre property; they have to put up with three,71
NA,sports cars; they have to put up with three,72
NA,ate homes. The poor things nave to send their,72
NA,children to Melbourne Grammar School. If they,72
NA,have only one child they have to send him,72
NA,Magdalen College at Oxford. They have to try to,72
NA,"get by on $2,000 a week. So it is after all,",72
NA,egalitarian society. Even the rich are having,72

Mr KING ,Wimmera) (4.56)-I t is always,72
NA,interesting to follow the honourable member,72
NA,Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) in a debate in,72
NA,this House. The honourable member seems to,72
NA,have an obsession with many things. One can,72
NA,always bet dollars to gooseberries that he,72
NA,start talking about die great profits-th e,72
NA,profits' I think he called them today-o f the multhat,72
NA,tinationals. I think the honourable member ratesthey,72
NA,challenged the House to name any multinational This,72
NA,which had not made record profits. I only wish I the differing,72
NA,had a bit more time to take him up on that point. numbers,72
NA,When talking about multinationals,72
NA,able member for Hindmarsh and many other heavy burden on many country,72
NA,members of the Opposition seem to forget,72
NA,"irrespective of the size of profits, the important",72
NA,"point is the investment that is involved. In other extensively in metropolitan areas, country",72
NA,"words, the honourable member for Hindmarsh",72
NA,ought to look at the return that they receive for,72
NA,their capital investment. I am quite sure that if he heavy,72
NA,only accepted that argument he would appreciUke some,72
NA,ate what this matter is all about.,72
NA,After listening to the speeches made by memthese,72
NA,bers of the Opposition during this debate,72
NA,heve that there is very Utile one needs to,72
NA,answer to their criticism. I do not think I,72
NA,heard weaker comment from members of the brought,72
NA,Opposition during a Budget debate in the 18,72
NA,years I have been a member of this place. I thinkthe,72
NA,the same observation applies to comment that,72
NA,has been made outside this place. I do not think,72
NA,that there is any need for me to concentrate a area only.,72
NA,great deal of my time on answering anything,72
NA,"has been put up by the Opposition. Also, I do not",72
NA,think that there is any need for me to expand,72
NA,some of the virtues of the Budget because this honourable,72
NA,has been done ably and well by many speakers the,72
NA,from my side of poUtics.,72
NA,I wish to raise a few issues that I believe,72
NA,Government should consider in the near future,72
NA,because I believe that no matter how good a,72
NA,budget may be there is always room for centre,72
NA,improvement. The first matter I wish to mention,72
NA,concerns Telecom AustraUa. I think I can say,72
NA,that in my 18 years as a member of this place,72
NA,separthere has been no problem more constant than,72
NA,the telephone problem and it is still growing.,72
NA,Years ago it was the poor service. Then came the,72
NA,to cost of upgrading telephone lines in country,72
NA,areas. Today it is the charges involved. These are,72
NA,an the basic complaints. The upgrading of tele-,72
NA,it phone Unes started many years ago on a point,72
NA,system. The then Liberal-Country Party Govern-,72
NA,ment introduced a 25 kUometre departmental,72
NA,We had a change of government and the,72
NA,Labor Government reduced this to eight ldlo-,72
NA,metres. It estabUshed the Telecommunications,72
NA,and Postal Commissions and laid down the fun-,72
NA,for damental rules that would apply. The main fea-,72
NA,tures ofthe rules were that 50 per cent of capital,72
NA,was to come from revenue and that the user pays,72
NA,principle should be adopted with little thought,72
NA,will given to those residing in remote areas.,72
NA,'record Labor saddled the Commissions to a degree,72
NA,had no alternative but to increase the,72
NA,dramatically. We all recall this very vividly.,72
NA,increase was coupled with the removal of,72
NA,rental rates in accordance with the,72
NA,the honourfor a local caU fee. Thisthat,72
NA,of subscribers could be contacted,72
NA,then became a very,72
NA,business houses,72
NA,that as well as private citizens and primary,72
NA,In this day and age when the telephoneproducers.,72
NA,is used so,72
NA,cities,72
NA,"and towns, any increased rates in instaUation",72
NA,"charges, rental, local or trunk charges are a very",72
NA,"burden on such users. My Party and I, un-",72
NA,of my colleagues on the other side of,72
NA,"the chamber, have been very concerned about",72
NA,rates for a very longtime.We have endeav-,72
NA,I beoured to have improvements made. We did,72
NA,say in make some progress up until the change of,72
NA,have government in 1972. This change in government,72
NA,badtimesas far as subscribers were con-,72
NA,"cerned, the worst being the charter laid down for",72
NA,Commissioners. I could give many examples,72
NA,of genuine hardship but time will not allow me to,72
NA,do so. I wtil therefore confine my remarks to one,72
NA,"that Strange as it may seem, the matter I wish to",72
NA,raise concerns an area that is common to both the,72
NA,member for Wannon ( Mr Malcolm,72
NA,Fraser) and myself. I refer to the area known as,72
NA,Balmoral district which is situated appro-,72
NA,ximately half way between Hamilton in the,72
NA,the Prime Minister's electorate and Horsham in the,72
NA,Wimmera electorate. The distance between the,72
NA,two major centres is some 80 miles. But in the,72
NA,the residents are unable to ring either city,72
NA,for a local call fee. This may seem strange to,72
NA,many people in this chamber. One exchange can,72
NA,contact only some 400 subscribers for a local fee.,72
NA,I wonder how many people subscribers in metrosuch,73
NA,poUtan areas can contact for the local caU fee?,73
NA,The people in this area have no access to,73
NA,"doctor, hospital or major business house by way",73
NA,of a local call. On inquiry I am told that because,73
NA,of the zoning system there is Utde chance,73
NA,improvement They wtil continue to pay trunk,73
NA,rates for such calls. I wonder how many metroto,73
NA,S otitan subscribers would accept this situation?,73
NA,"officers ofthe Department or the Telecommunispeech,",73
NA,cations Commission are no doubt sympathetic,73
NA,and have done aU that is possible to assist but,73
NA,condition laid down in the charter of the,73
NA,mission ties their hands. So I appeal to the,73
NA,as weU as to the Minister for Post and Telecomcould,73
NA,munications ( Mr Eric Robinson) to give conUnfortunately,73
NA,sideration to easing the burden in such cases.,73
NA,The Commission is introducing a new radio,73
NA,telephone in the area of Longreach,73
NA,torate of Kennedy. I am sure that the honourable,73
NA,member for Kennedy ( Mr Katter) knows about,73
NA,that because no doubt he has had a bit to do with,73
NA,it. I am weU aware of the problems facing the,73
NA,Commission regarding charges of various kinds.,73
NA,In accordance with the charter the Commission,73
NA,has to find about 50 per cent of capital and it also areas.,73
NA,has to implement the unfair user pays principle.,73
NA,If we adopt this principle in every other departI,73
NA,"ment, weU and good, but we do not do so. That is",73
NA,the all important point.,73
NA,Postal and telephone facUities are to my mind,73
NA,a service to the community. Government memon,73
NA,bers must always remember that. What would,73
NA,the position if we adopted a user pays principle,73
NA,in respect of many other fields in which the,73
NA,"monwealth has a responsibihty such as raUways,",73
NA,"education, water supply, social welfare and",73
NA,health? If we subsidise these fields and if we,73
NA,"sidise pensioners, why do we not subsidise",73
NA,people who Uve in isolated areas? I am told that,73
NA,"if a fuU charge, including aU capital costs such",73
NA,the cost associated with the construction of dams,73
NA,"and water reticulation, was made in some States",73
NA,"for water consumed, water would be too dear",73
NA,drink. We should think of the,73
NA,paid for shipbuUding which amounts to thou-,73
NA,sands of dollars for each man employed. This,73
NA,gument was put to the House not so many,73
NA,months ago. Therefore I say it is about time,73
NA,something was done to ease the problems of,73
NA,Telecom in areas outside our capital cities.,73
NA,Senator Lewis recently presented in the Senate,73
NA,a petition calling for the introduction of equal,73
NA,telephone charges throughout AustraUa based fallen,73
NA,on atimecaU. This petition was taken up by,73
NA,country people and it reaUy burnt I know that,73
NA,a scheme has many problems such as load-,73
NA,ing existing services and the fact that a 10c,73
NA,charge wtil not bring in the necessary revenue,73
NA,a required. Another problem is the fact that many,73
NA,city users would not accept such a scheme. But,73
NA,many thousands of subscribers want to see a,73
NA,of change. Senator Lewis and I agree that some-,73
NA,thing must be done when subscribers are forced,73
NA,"pay trunk charges to caU their doctor, hospital",73
NA,or business centre. As I mentioned earUer in my,73
NA,we subsidise other fields. We subsidise,73
NA,certain pensioners who in many cases are not in,73
NA,the such need of a telephone as are people living in,73
NA,Comremote areas where installation and trunk,73
NA,House charges are extremely high and in some cases,73
NA,be classified almost as discriminative.,73
NA,Senator Lewis' scheme as put for-,73
NA,ward could not be fully implemented. Neverthe-,73
NA,"less, the idea is a very worthy one and I com-",73

NA,"there was an improvement all round. Today, be-",73
NA,"as cause of economic pressures, our immigration",73

NA,In recenttimeswe have heard a lot about,74

NA,as I could not beUeve that the honourable,74
NA,senator could be so naive as to suggest that it was,74
NA,Culthe government of which he was a member that,74
NA,was responsible for those sales. Surely he must,74
NA,a appreciate that when international meat sales,74
NA,take place it is not Uke walking into a shop and,74
NA,buying a bag of lollies. Most deliveries are made,74
NA,as a result of decisions taken months earUer-i n,74

NA,should be getting the credit for any actions that,75

NA,that a large number of members of that organisment,75
NA,ation are genuinely looking for some assistance,75
NA,and they thought that the only way in which theycame,75
NA,could put forward a case to the government of,75
NA,the day was to form a new organisation. Anyone,75
NA,who understands the industry realises that a new,75
NA,program for handling meat cannot be introduced,75
NA,overnight. We have heard a lot about meat,75
NA,"classification, covering weight and grade and",75
NA,"sorts of things. It is terribly important, but it",75
NA,take many months to introduce it and to have,75
NA,available in all the large areas in which it,75

Mr YOUNG ,Port Adelaide) (5.16)-Like,75
NA,Nelson's Column this Budget has crashed to the,75
NA,ground. There is total confusion throughout this,75
NA,country about the impact of this Budget and the,75
NA,Government has been doing its best to restrict,75
NA,debate on the Budget to non-broadcast days in,75
NA,order to redeem itself from what it may have,75
NA,done in the Budget. I want to reflect on two mat-,75
NA,ters which the Government saw as being of,75
NA,prime importance in this second Fraser Govern-,75
NA,"ment Budget. Firsdy I refer to taxation, and sec-",75
NA,beondly to what the Government has done or,75
NA,has not done to put young people back to,75
NA,work. In presenting his Budget the Treasurer,75
NA,( Mr Lynch) said that this new taxation adjust-,75
NA,was arevolutionary new scheme for per-,75
NA,"sonal income tax. However, when the scheme",75
NA,under scrutiny in the days that followed the,75
NA,"delivery of the Budget, not only was it exposed",75
NA,by the Opposition in this ParUament but also by,75
NA,every other group interested in personal income,75
NA,tax. What it turns out to be is a system which,75
NA,assists those on the greatest income and tends,75
NA,all along with other decisions of the Government to,75
NA,wtil act against those people who happen to be on av-,75
NA,it erage weekly earnings and who are now paying,75
NA,is so the Medibank levy. What the Government has,75
NA,failed to do in its new scheme is consider the,75
NA,other imposts it has placed upon the Australian,75
NA,commumty in the form of the Medibank levy,75
NA,be and the move towards world parity prices for,75
NA,crude oti.,75
NA,The average weekly earner willfindthat he is,75
NA,off under this new revolutionary scheme,75
NA,for,75

NA,"great deal more than that, and so they do, but",75
NA,of the vast majority of wage earners in this country,75

NA,will not for the revolutionary scheme.,75
NA,"$8,000 to",75
NA,be,75
NA,they are,75
NA,substantially,75
NA,worse off in their weekly pay packet than they,75
NA,before this revolutionary scheme was,75
NA,introduced.,75
NA,The Government went to so much trouble,75
NA,through the voice of the Treasurer to tell us how,75
NA,much benefit it was going to rain on the wage,75
NA,and salary earner as a result of this new taxation,76
NA,system. But the system has been exposed,76
NA,what it is and I do not wish to add my voice,76
NA,objection to it by going through the details,76
NA,figures which have been published. Suffice forassistance.,76
NA,me to say that it is a fraud on the average,76
NA,to have him beheve that something great will,76
NA,happen to his wage packet next February when them,76
NA,this revolutionary new taxation system comes those more,76
NA,into operation because it will,76
NA,home less after 1 February next year than he greater incentive tothe,76
NA,takes home now.,76
NA,Let me take it one step further and consider,76
NA,the concept of taxation relief. If thefiguresthat,76
NA,have been given by so many instrumentalities are,76
NA,correct the people who will gain most out of,76
NA,"taxation adjustment are those earning $15,000 a",76
NA,year and more. There are very few people in,76
NA,"community, a handful representingfiveper cent",76
NA,"or 10 per cent perhaps, earning more than",76
NA,"$15,000 a year. According to the Treasurer's",76
NA,"figures a person on $ 10,000 will save $ 195 a yearspend",76
NA,"while a person on $15,000 will save $543 a year",76
NA,"and, going further up the salary scale, a person",76
NA,"on $25,000 will save $1,000 a year. Who in",76
NA,"right mind, considering all the problems that",76
NA,"Australia is facing today, could justify a person",76
NA,"on $25,000 a year saving through this new",76
NA,revolutionary taxation system $20 a week while,76
NA,5.4 per cent of our work force or almost,76
NA,people are out of work? Time and again Govern-,76
NA,ment spokesmen have stood in this Parhament,76
NA,and said that one man's pay increase is another,76
NA,man's job. That is not the Opposition's,76
NA,philosophy but it is the type of chche that is used,76
NA,regularly by Government spokesmen. If it is true,76
NA,to say that a wage increase for one person in,76
NA,job may cost another person the opportunity,76
NA,"finding a job, why does not the same theory",76
NA,apply to taxation relief?,76
NA,"If a government is prepared to spend $ 1,000m",76
NA,on taxation relief which will go mainly to those,76
NA,"on high incomes, why does it not save those",76
NA,financial resources and give them to the people,76
NA,who really need them? Why do we not index the,76
NA,unemployment benefit and make it equal to half,76
NA,average weekly earnings? Why do we not spend,76
NA,"more on manpower training, relocation and",76
NA,retraining? Why do we not spend more on young,76
NA,people? I will have a lot more to say about the,76
NA,opportunities provided by this Government for,76
NA,young people. How can the Government justify,76
NA,the expenditure of this money on the highest,76
NA,"income earners while we are facing such enorployed,",76
NA,mous economic problems? How can the Prime,76
NA,Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) justify a member,76
NA,"of Parliament saving $20 a week in taxation,",76
NA,"the Treasurer saving $30 a week, or the Prime",76
NA,for Minister himself saving $50 a week while we,76
NA,in have these problems? It is not as though people,76
NA,and on that range of income need this sort of,76
NA,worker The Treasurer said that this new scheme wdl,76
NA,give people more incentive to work and will give,76
NA,incentive to work overtime. People on,76
NA,not. He will take annual salary.do,76
NA,"salaries not get paid overtime, it is an",76
NA,Is Treasurer going to have,76
NA,work because he saves $30 a,76
NA,week? Is the life of a member of Parhament or of,76
NA,a person on a similar salary going to change dra-,76
NA,matically as a result of this new scheme? Is then-,76
NA,lifestyle or their attitude to employment going to,76
NA,this change because they will save that amount of,76
NA,money as a result of this revolutionary tax adjust-,76
NA,our ment which at the sametimewill place a penalty,76
NA,on a person receiving average weekly earnings?,76
NA,This is a government which believes in the great,76
NA,"class distinction, which believes that it should",76
NA,"its resources on the top echelon, on its sup-",76
NA,porters. It wants to forget about the person on,76
NA,average weekly earnings and about those who,76
NA,his are unemployed. I would like to hear any mem-,76
NA,ber of this national Parhament tell us how a per-,76
NA,son on average weekly earnings with a wife and,76
NA,"two or three dependants is living, how he is",76
NA,enjoying the luxuries which this country has to,76
NA,"400,000 offer. He is the forgotten person.",76
NA,This Government is paying less and less atten-,76
NA,tion to the massive problems we face in putting,76
NA,"young people to work, in training them for the",76
NA,work that is available and in giving them the vo-,76
NA,cational guidance that is necessary. Countries in,76
NA,a Western Europe are leaving us far behind in this,76
NA,of regard. So much for the revolutionary new tax-,76
NA,ation system. So much for the taxation system,76
NA,which will do all things for all men in this,76
NA,country. The new revolutionary tax system as it is,76
NA,called is an absolute fraud because the vast ma-,76
NA,jority of people will pay more and those who,76
NA,enjoy the privileges ofa high income will receive,76
NA,more and more of the benefits whichflowfrom,76
NA,the decisions of this Government. The Govern-,76
NA,ment ought to look closely at what it has done.,76
NA,Before 1 February next year it ought to divert,76
NA,thosefinancialresources now being allocated in,76
NA,tax adjustment to areas where they are really,76
NA,needed. How dare the Federal Parliament of this,76
NA,country spend so much money by pouring it into,76
NA,the people already in jobs and on high incomes,76
NA,"while we are facing a total of 500,000 unem-",76
NA,6 per cent or 7 per cent of the work force.,76
NA,This includes young people who have left school,76
NA,and who have been searching for theirfirstjob,76
NA,or for a year or more. They have had a year on,76
NA,"unemployment benefit, walking around the",77
NA,countryside looking forjobs.,77
NA,"So I say that this is a government of privilege,",77
NA,and that is the way in which this decision has,77
NA,been made. That is the only way in which the de-,77
NA,cision can be interpreted. I say something now,77
NA,about the unemployed youth in this country and,77
NA,what is happening throughout the rest of the,77
NA,"world. The Budget Speech, like so many other",77
NA,"important areas, pays scant attention to the",77
NA,massive problem of unemployment. The state-,77
NA,ments attached to the Budget Speech tell us that,77
NA,at best- I use the words in the Budget,77
NA,Speech-w e can expect the same level of unem-,77
NA,E loyment at the end of thisfinancialyear as we,77
NA,ave at the moment-5. 4 per cent of the work,77
NA,force. That is the sort of problem we are facing.,77
NA,While other countries with similar problems are,77
NA,moving and adapting to the situation with all,77
NA,"sorts of structural adjustment programs, this",77
NA,country is being left further and further behind.,77
NA,This Government beheves that one day some,77
NA,great miracle will occur and everybody will be,77
NA,put back to work. The Government forgets that,77
NA,we are facing new economic problems in the,77
NA,search for the recipe to overcome the unem-,77
NA,ployment problem.,77
NA,The Government is trying to condition us. It is,77
NA,saying that full employment is a myth. It existed,77
NA,for 20 or 30 years but no one in Australia should,77
NA,really expect us to get back to full employment,77
NA,"because, as I say, this is a government of privi-",77
NA,lege which beUeves that the privileged can live a,77
NA,Uttle better if there is a pool of unemployment,77
NA,and that perhaps it can use this pressure group of,77
NA,unemployed to keep those in work regimented.,77
NA,That is not the accepted phtiosophy of those on,77
NA,this side of the House. When the Government,77
NA,"goes to the polls, whether it be at the end of this",77
NA,"year, or in May or November of next year, we",77
NA,know now from the Budget that there wtil be,77
NA,massive unemployment and every honourable,77
NA,member on the Government side-,77
NA,Mr Sullivan-Whe n do you think?,77
Mr YOUNG,I shaU deal with the National,77
NA,Country Party in a minute. The honourable,77
NA,member has been so quiet since his friend from,77
NA,Hume has been away and one would have,77
NA,expected better manners from him. Let us com-,77
NA,pare what honourable members are saying about,77
NA,cattle with what they are saying about people. In,77
NA,that way we can expose the fallacies of the poU-,77
NA,cies of the Country Party. Throughout the ad-,77
NA,vanced Western world 40 per cent of the unem-,77
NA,"ployed are under 25 years of age; that is, seven",77
NA,million young people in the most developed,77
NA,regions of the Western world are looking for,77
NA,jobs. AustraUa is no exception. In many ways we,77
NA,are leading. Let us look at the most recent figures,77
NA,that have been published in various surveys or at,77
NA,figures given by the AustraUan Bureau of Stat-,77
NA,istics or the Commonwealth Employment Ser-,77
NA,vice. In the Melbourne Age quite recently we find,77
NA,that in the 15 to 19 years bracket there are,77
NA,"42,000 males looking for jobs and 45,000 fe-",77
NA,"males; in the 20 to 24 years bracket 33,000 males",77
NA,"and 24,000 young women are looking for jobs.",77
NA,This is a major problem in this country which has,77
NA,been ignored by the Budget.,77
NA,Mr Sullivan-TeU the truth.,77
Mr YOUNG,M y friend the honourable,77
NA,member from the Country Party has come in,77
NA,here to provoke me into telling him what is going,77
NA,on in the country. The Country Party delights the,77
NA,ParUament by talking about trees and animals. It,77
NA,is only since the AustraUan Labor Party has,77
NA,taken up the cudgels on behalf of country people,77
NA,and since the AustraUan Cattlemen's Union has,77
NA,been formed that this Government has taken any,77
NA,notice of the mtiitancy which is growing in,77
NA,country areas about something being done be-,77
NA,cause of what is happening. Let us look at what,77
NA,happens in the country and at the number of,77
NA,young people who are out of work in country dis-,77
NA,tricts. Why does not the Country Party raise,77
NA,these matters? In Albury 45 per cent of those un-,77
NA,employed are under 25 years of age; in Armidale,77
NA,it is 46 per cent; in Bathurst it is 39 per cent; in,77
NA,Bega 38 per cent; in Casino 32 per cent; in Cess-,77
NA,nock 45 per cent; in Charlestown 52 per cent; in,77
NA,Coffs Harbour 33 per cent; in Cowra 42 per cent;,77
NA,in Dubbo 41 per cent; and so the percentage go,77
NA,on right through the country districts of New,77
NA,"South Wales. We find that over 40 per cent and,",77
NA,"in some cases, over 50 per cent of people who are",77
NA,unemployed are under 25 years of age.,77
NA,This Government has done absolutely nothing,77
NA,about the matter. It has said: 'We wtil spend,77
NA,$102m on the various programs which we have,77
NA,going. We hope that the additional money we,77
NA,"are putting in from the Budget wtil put 15,000",77
NA,people between the ages of 15 and 24 back to,77
NA,"work'. But 145,000 people between the ages of",77
NA,15 and 24 are looking for a job. This Govern-,77
NA,ment says: 'We have put hi enough money for,77
NA,"15,000 people'. So the other 130,000 can con-",77
NA,tinue to walk around the countryside and have,77
NA,their number added to by the massive number of,77
NA,school leavers who wtil hit the labour market,77
NA,later this year. The Country Party does not give a,77
NA,damn about the young people out of jobs in,77
NA,"country areas, Because of this and other issues",77
NA,"which are emerging in the countiyside, there wtil",77
NA,"be wholesale revolt at the next election, not only",78
NA,in the suburbs of the cities but also in country,78
NA,areas because those areas are being badly,78
NA,represented. Their voice is not being heard. Beef,78
NA,producers are concerned not only about their,78
NA,industry but also about their chUdren and their,78
NA,opportunities. They are not sacrificing everything,78
NA,to send their chUdren to school knowing that,78
NA,when they complete their studies they wUl be,78
NA,the dole queues. It is not just the sons and,78
NA,daughters of Labor Parry supporters who cannot,78
NA,"find jobs. This situation cuts across all classes,",78
NA,regions. It is about time the Government was,78
NA,"cognisant of the long term, massive problem",78
NA,which is confronting this country. The GovernwUl,78
NA,ment ought to be condemned for the way in,78
NA,which it has ignored the problem in its Budget.,78
NA,Let us look at the metropolitan area. One can,78
NA,understand a conservative government ignoring,78
NA,the massive working class districts of the cities,78
NA,because it does not care about them and it does,78
NA,not represent them. As such the government,78
NA,not relate to those areas; it does not,78
NA,them. Right throughout the cities onefindsthat,78
NA,it is a Labor district the Government does,78
NA,care about it. Let us look at the massive unemtion,78
NA,ployment among young people in the metropolileft,78
NA,tan areas. In Leichhardt 575 young men and,78
NA,young women are unemployed. Other figures,78
NA,"are: MarrickvUle, 489 and 466; Liverpool, 1,299",78
NA,"and 1,281; Campsie, 660 and 572; Bondi, 455",78
NA,"and 532; Hurstville, 710 and 635; and Fairfield,",78
NA,731 and 833. We can go through every major,78
NA,"suburb in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and",78
NA,Adelaide and Perth and we wUl find that the,78
NA,greatest poUtical and social problem we have,78
NA,almost totally ignored by this conservative,78
NA,government whUe so many governments overIt,78
NA,"seas-th e British, French, ItaUan, Scandinavian",78
NA,and American-ar e experimenting with a multiside,78
NA,"pUcity of ideas such as early retirement, a shorter",78
NA,"working week, and subsidised work for young",78
NA,people. All sorts of innovative schemes are being,78
NA,introduced throughout the Western world in an,78
NA,effort to overcome this problem.,78
NA,This Fraser Administration between 11 tors,78
NA,November 1975 and 13 December,78
NA,you getridof the Labor Government,78
NA,rid of all the problems'. That was the Governwant,78
NA,ment's policy. That is why the Government was,78
NA,"elected. Now there are 100,000 more unem-",78
NA,ployed than there were when Mr Fraser was speech,78
NA,elected on 13 December 1975. Over 50 per cent,78
NA,of the young people who leave school in the,78
NA,country districts in 1977 wUl not be able to find,78
NA,employment. So if the honourable member for,78
NA,Riverina ( Mr SulUvan) wants to make himself,78
NA,popular with his constituents I suggest that he go,78
NA,"back to Griffith, to Leeton, to Balranald and to",78
NA,all those towns and teU the people in them that,78
NA,50 per cent of their kids wUl not be able to find,78
NA,jobs. That is the result ofthe Fraser Government.,78
NA,The whole Budget has been a hoax. There has,78
NA,been massive confusion about whom it affects.,78
NA,All of a sudden we can see through it. We know,78
NA,in exacdy whom it affects. It means that average,78
NA,weekly earners wUl pay more tax. It means that,78
NA,employment opportunities for people leaving,78
NA,allcolleges and schools throughout Australia have,78
NA,been reduced to virtually ml. A lot of people who,78
NA,have been trained to do certain academic work,78
NA,be doing labouring work because the prom-,78
NA,ises made by this Government and the ambitions,78
NA,which they set themselves during the educational,78
NA,process cannot be met. It does not have any idea.,78
NA,It should be condemned for the way in which it,78
NA,has presented this Budget to the Australian,78
NA,people. The Budget wUl be the springboard for,78
NA,does throwing this Government out of office.,78
Mr DONALD CAMERON ,Griffith),78
NA,if (5.35)-Th e honourable member for Port,78
NA,not Adelaide ( Mr Young) made absolutely no men-,78
NA,of the legacy that the previous Government,78
NA,AustraUa. He did not mention inflation. If,78
NA,546 ever there were an acknowledgement by an op-,78
NA,position that a government has come to grips,78
NA,with and is defeating the cause of so many of the,78
NA,"problems of this nation, it was his silence. The",78
NA,fact that the inflation rate was about 16.7 per,78
NA,cent when the previous Government stepped out,78
NA,is now about 10 per cent escaped him com-,78
NA,pletely. That is an indication that the present,78
NA,is Government is getting the ship back on course.,78
NA,We inherited a ship that had been gutted by fire.,78
NA,is not easy to rebuUd a ship that has been,78
NA,almost destroyed. I am not one of those on this,78
NA,of the House who say: 'Look at what we,78
NA,inherited. We have an excuse forever'. The Op-,78
NA,position fails to acknowledge that this Govern-,78
NA,ment is making progress. The honourable mem-,78
NA,ber referred to the level of unemployment and to,78
NA,our Umited ability to reduce taxation. These fac-,78
NA,"are a direct result of the rate of inflation, the",78
NA,1975 said: 'If were left. Itand,78
NA,uncertainty,78
NA,is,78
NA,the lack of confidence which we,78
NA,little wonder that he walks out of,78
NA,you wUl get the chamber. It is little,78
NA,to hear the truth. wonder that he does not,78
NA,The shallow honourable member made a,78
NA,to impress his electorate. He spoke as if,78
NA,the Labor Party was the only party in AustraUa,78
NA,which regarded itself as being concerned for the,78
NA,less fortunate in our society. It does not have a,78
NA,monopoly on that concern. If members of the,78
NA,Opposition feel that honourable members on this,78
NA,side ofthe House have no compassion for the un-,79
NA,"employed, they are wrong. We care. The situ-",79
NA,"ation that we inherited, which required having to",79
NA,"attend carefully to the economy, has prolonged",79
NA,the task of reducing the level of unemployment. I,79
NA,"beheve that the return of stability, the return of",79
NA,confidence and the defeat of inflation will return,79
NA,Austraha to the conditions which existed when,79
NA,the Labor Government took office. The Australia,79
NA,which it took over after Mr MCMahon's Govern-,79
NA,"ment was defeated, despite some of the minor ills",79
NA,"which it was suffering, was in comparison a very",79
NA,healthy Australia. The level of unemployment,79
NA,"was 130,000 or 140,000. We had not had pro-",79
NA,"jected afigureof 300,000 unemployed before",79
NA,those three destructive years.,79
NA,The honourable member for Port Adelaide,79
NA,spent a lot of time talking about taxation and,79
NA,how the benefits would accrue to only a few. The,79
NA,"first point I make is that 225,000 Australians",79
NA,"are presentiy paying income tax will, because of",79
NA,"the recent Budget, in future be exempt from",79
NA,ing income tax. The minimum taxable income,79
NA,has been lifted. That has benefited almost,79
NA,"230,000 AustraUans. Yettisteningto the honourtem",79
NA,able member one would think that the Governatmosphere,79
NA,ment had doubled the income tax rate. Furtherthere,79
NA,"more, he referred to the new system which will",79
NA,be introduced. I must draw to his attention the back a lot.,79
NA,fact that the Henderson report on poverty- a,79
NA,document often quoted by the Leader of the Op-,79
NA,position ( Mr E. G. Whitlam) when he was Prime,79
NA,Minister-state d that Austraha should have,79
NA,"income tax scheme of a simphfied kind, involvWhitlam",79
NA,ing a standard rate of tax plus surcharges,79
NA,people who have high incomes. The honourable,79
NA,member said that we give to people on higher,79
NA,incomes a greater tax rehef than we do to people,79
NA,on lower incomes. I am pleased to say that not,79
NA,members of the Opposition indulge in this pracit,79
NA,tice. Everybody knows that under the present,79
NA,"scheme, the one which the Labor Party retained",79
NA,and the one which fed Laborfires-it wanted,79
NA,inflation in this country-th e more people's,79
NA,wages rose the more taxation rose and the more,79
NA,Labor could irresponsiblyfinanceits programs,79
NA,and pohcies without giving a,79
NA,the money was coming from.,79
Mr HODGMAN ,Spen d it like water.,79
Mr DONALD CAMERON,As the honourto a,79
NA,"able member for Denison said, spend it like",79
NA,water. The taxation contribution of Mr and Mrs the,79
NA,Working AustraUa was increased by 89 per cent person,79
NA,in those three years.,79
Mr YOUNG ,Wha t did you say when I went,79
NA,out?,79
Mr DONALD CAMERON,The honourable,79
NA,member for Port Adelaide is back and is inter-,79
NA,"jecting. Mr Deputy Speaker, would you quell",79
NA,him? He is onfireagain. There was this vast tax,79
NA,rip-off. Yet the honourable member said today,79
NA,that we are assisting the rich and not the poor.,79
NA,"The facts are, as we all know, that the people in",79
NA,our society who are well off pay infinitely more,79
NA,tax-thousand s of doUars in many cases. The,79
NA,honourable member for Port Adelaide ( Mr,79
NA,Young) has frequendy complained in this Parlia-,79
NA,"ment that when his income was $21,000 a year",79
NA,"the tax man was ripping off $9,500. That was",79
NA,almost 50 per cent of what he was earning before,79
NA,his recent increase. That is an example of how,79
NA,those on higher incomes pay such a high pro-,79
NA,portion of their income in taxation. If there is to,79
NA,"be reUef, of course those who pay the greatest",79
NA,amount of taxation wtil get the greater reUef in,79
NA,terms of dollars and cents. We cannot escape the,79
NA,who fact that every working Australian wtil get reUef,79
NA,as a result of this most progressive taxation pro-,79
NA,paygram which comes into being as from 1 February,79
NA,of next year. Every Australian wtil benefit. The,79
NA,reason why the Labor Party condemns the sys-,79
NA,so often is that it is endeavouring to create an,79
NA,of disbeUef and concern so that if,79
NA,is an early election the people wtil not,79
NA,readily recognise that this Government has given,79
NA,Indexation must be taken into account also. A,79
NA,lot of people do not reatise that the Government,79
NA,an has given back millions of dollars that the,79
NA,Government would have collected if it,79
NA,on had stayed in power. When the new scheme is,79
NA,"taken in conjunction with indexation, it can be",79
NA,seen that the Fraser Government is giving back,79
NA,to the Austrahan people on an annual basis,79
NA,"all about $2,000m a year more than it would have if",79
NA,had not kept its promise of setting about to,79
NA,reform and reduce the income tax scales. That,79
NA,deserves praise. I commend the Treasurer ( Mr,79
NA,"Lynch), the Cabinet and this Government for",79
NA,being a government which cares for the people,79
NA,and which is determined to carry out its prom-,79
NA,ises. So much for the honourable member for,79
NA,thought to where Port Adelaide.,79
NA,I take the opportunity in this debate to make,79
NA,some reference to the reply of the Minister for,79
NA,Immigration and Ethnic Affairs ( Mr MACKellar),79
NA,question about the entry into Australia of,79
NA,Domenico Barbara. Earlier this year I expressed,79
NA,view that Mr Grassby was a most unsuitable,79
NA,to hold down the position of Com-,79
NA,missioner for Community Relations. Events in,79
NA,recent weeks have confirmed that I am not alone,79
NA,in holding that view. The spectacle of hundreds,79
NA,of residents of the western New South Wales,80
NA,town of Griffith booing and hooting Mr Grassby,80
NA,during an interview on the David Frost Show,80
NA,an unparalleled indication of pubhc contempt,80
NA,towards the Commissioner by people who knew,80
NA,the man whom so many people talk about so suspicion,80
NA,"unfavourably. After all, he was their member",80
NA,the State ParUament and later in the Federal,80
NA,ParUament for many years. Who would know,80
NA,him better than they.,80
NA,Newspaper headlines this week and an answer,80
NA,given by the Mmister for Immigration,80
NA,ing provide even more grounds for concern,80
NA,about Mr Grassby's suitability to hold down,80
NA,"even a clerk's job in the PubUc Service, let alone",80
NA,"the position of a $44,000 a year commissioner",80
NA,who is supposed to mediate in cases in which,80
NA,alleged that racial overtones might exist. It,80
NA,would seem unfair to seize upon the conflict in,80
NA,the transcripts of the various radio interviews,80
NA,and the newspaper reports of,80
NA,has or has not said in relation to the Barbaro,80
NA,case. If he has not kept photocopies,80
NA,mentation in relation to this case- I beUeve he,80
NA,"has-h e has a magnificent memory, considering",80
NA,that as a Minister he handled half a mtition,80
NA,He has stated: ' Mr Barbaro was aUowed to,80
NA,come to AustraUa to visit his dying mother'.,80
NA,was more than three years ago. I am sure that,80
NA,every honourable member would share my hapincreased,80
NA,"piness at the fact that the elderly Mrs Barbaro,",80
NA,"Uving in Adelaide, is still aUve and",80
NA,well. But Mr Grassby did say that the decision to,80
NA,aUow entry was made following a departmental,80
NA,recommendation. This morning the Mmister for,80
NA,Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in effect,80
NA,informed the House that his Department has,80
NA,strenuously advised Mr Grassby that deported,80
NA,"Domenico Barbaro, who is currendy serving 14",80
NA,"to 18 years in prison in Italy, should not be",80
NA,lowed to re-enter AustraUa because of his crimime,80
NA,nal background. Mr Grassby stated yesterday,80
NA,also that Mr Barbaro was shadowed by pohce,80
NA,during his brief visit to AustraUa. My inquiries,80
NA,have estabUshed that Mr Barbaro was not was,80
NA,shadowed by Commonwealth Police as claimed.,80
NA,"It would seem that Mr Grassby, in an effort",80
NA,appease the whims and desires of either a person,80
NA,whom he sees as holding an important position,80
NA,"in the world or an international organisation,",80
NA,agreed under the guise of compassion,80
NA,ately to override the strong advice given to him,80
NA,as the Minister not to allow the entry to AustraUa,80
NA,of a person who can only be described as highly caused it.,80
NA,undesirable. The clouds over the head of Mr,80
NA,Grassby continue td gather and to darken. It,80
NA,time action was taken to investigate fully the,80
NA,man so that the doubts wbich exist in my mind,80
NA,and in the minds of millions of AustraUans are,80
NA,was either confirmed or dispeUed. If Mr Grassby's,80
NA,activities are beyond reproach his family and he,80
NA,deserve to have the heavy veU of current pubUc,80
NA,lifted. I sincerely hope that the Minister,80
NA,in in charge of the Commissioner's responsibUities,80
NA,wtil set about urgently to settle once and for all,80
NA,the suspicions surrounding the background and,80
NA,the activities of the man who holds down the,80
NA,very important position of Commissioner for,80
NA,this mornCommumty Relations.,80
NA,In the remaining minutes of my contribution,80
NA,to this debate I wish to refer to the Auditor-,80
NA,"General's annual report, which was tabled yes-",80
NA,"terday, in which it was alleged that approxi-",80
NA,it is mately $60m had been paid out accidently by,80
NA,the Department of Social Security. I wish to refer,80
NA,also to the allegations of a Public Service union,80
NA,that this problem was caused mainly because of,80
NA,what Mr Grassby staff shortages.,80
NA,Mr Brown-Wh y should that be said? It is a lot,80
NA,of the docuof nonsense.,80
Mr DONALD CAMERON,The honourable,80
NA,cases. member for Diamond Valley-the y caU him,80
NA,'Sparkles' these days-sai d that it is a lot of non-,80
NA,"sense. I agree with him because, as was pointed",80
NA,That out today by the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm,80
NA,"Fraser), the staff in the Department has been",80
NA,by some 900 persons in recent months.,80
NA,Its need for staff to carry a greater work load was,80
NA,reasonably met to a very large degree.,80
NA,The matter I wish to report to the House is my,80
NA,concern in recent months at having received a,80
NA,number of phone caUs from constituents who,80
NA,"have said: ' Mr Cameron, I have been back at",80
NA,work for a month. I have advised the Depart-,80
NA,ment that I am back at work but my cheques con-,80
NA,altinue to come'. In some cases constituents told,80
NA,that they had been told by some careless pub-,80
NA,Uc official-thi s was very careless indeed-tha t,80
NA,they should just bank the cheque and forget,80
NA,about it. Heaven forbid! It was their money that,80
NA,being given away as weU as the money of the,80
NA,"honourable member for Hunter ( Mr James),",80
NA,"who is attempting to interject, myself and every-",80
NA,to body else. The most distressing part was that,80
NA,these people who said: ' I have told them twice,80
NA,"and nothing has happened', were honest people",80
NA,has who realised that they did not deserve the,80
NA,deUbercheques but still they came.,80
Mr JAMES ,Yo u reduced the staff; that is what,80
Mr DONALD CAMERON, I reject that very,80
NA,is simplistic explanation from the honourable,80
NA,member for Hunter. Such was my concern that I,80
NA,tried to contact the head of the Department,81
NA,Social Security in Queensland. He was not availthat,81
NA,able at the time but I gave his secretary an,81
NA,example of the problem and said: ' I am not so,81
NA,"much interested in this particular case, but I",81
NA,plead with you and request that you look at the,81
NA,system which allows this to continue because that,81
NA,"is what needs attention'. It was a screaming,",81
NA,squeaking wheel and it needed oil. If the Departestablished.,81
NA,ment was so busy- I do not accept that it,81
NA,that it was not looking for the reasons for the,81
NA,errors which caused so many people to report see,81
NA,that they were continuing to receive not just one,81
NA,"cheque but two for which they were not eligible,",81
NA,to a degree it was irresponsible.,81
NA,The Government has altered the system in this,81
NA,Budget to make unemployment benefits payable,81
NA,"in arrears rather than in advance. Unfortunately,",81
NA,a lot of fears have been created in the commumty,81
NA,that this will mean that those,81
NA,rendy receiving a benefit will have a fortnight's,81
NA,payment wiped off and will have to wait a whole,81
NA,month for their next cheque. That is not true.,81
NA,Those people who when the Budget was preCameron).,81
NA,sented were receiving a benefit under the old,81
NA,tem will continue to receive that benefit under,81
NA,the old system. Like the honourable member for,81
NA,"Diamond Valley and others, I hope that those",81
NA,people who are currendy unemployed will not,81
NA,unemployed for much longer.,81
NA,The new system relates to the future. It simply,81
NA,means that if a person is unemployed,81
NA,qualify for the unemployment benefit and in,81
NA,about a fortnight his first cheque wdl be,81
NA,received; then it will be another fortnight,81
NA,the next cheque comes. Under the old system,81
NA,person would wait about 2Vi weeks to 3 weeks,81
NA,for his first cheque and then four orfivedays,81
NA,later another cheque would arrive. So he was,81
NA,really receiving a double payment. That is how,81
NA,unemployed people were being paid in advance.,81
NA,The new system will not cause that much,81
NA,ship. When we see an amount of $60m overpaid,81
NA,I am sure that every thinking taxpayer and every,81
NA,thinking unemployed person who is hoping to,81
NA,back into the work force as quickly as possible,81
NA,become a taxpayer again would agree that the,81
NA,old system was very much in need,81
NA,and alteration.,81
NA,I do want to commend the Government on its,81
NA,"recent Budget. Regrettably, politics being",81
NA,"tics, when the pubhc listens to our debates m",81
NA,hament they hear one speaker who does not have,81
NA,a good word to say about the Budget and then,81
NA,they hear a speaker from the other side of the,81
NA,House saying what a marvellous Budget it is,81
NA,"that everything about it is good. I concede, as",81
NA,"of Government member, that many of the things",81
NA,the Government wished to do could not be,81
NA,done this year or at this time; but I swear that,81
NA,what has been done is to the benefit of all Aus-,81
NA,tralians in the immediate term and in the future.,81
NA,I referred to the inheritance we received when,81
NA,we took back government as being a ship gutted,81
NA,by fire. Our economic structure is being re-,81
NA,"I am quite confident that, with the",81
NA,was- responsible attitude and good management,81
NA,"which have been brought to government, we will",81
NA,in the not too distant future the ship to which,81
NA,we all belong sailingfirmlyahead and still in the,81
NA,hands of a responsible and capable government.,81
Mr YOUNG ,Port Adelaide)- Mr Deputy,81
NA,"Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",81
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr MarVn)-Does,81
NA,the honourable member claim to have been,81
NA,people who are curmisrepresented?,81
Mr YOUNG,I do. Exactly 20 minutes ago a,81
NA,quite serious charge was made against me by the,81
NA,honourable member for Griffith ( Mr Donald,81
NA,He said that when he started his ad-,81
NA,"sysdress to the House, which followed immediately",81
NA,"upon my address in the Budget debate, I left the",81
NA,chamber because I did not want to hsten to the,81
NA,reply which he could make to what I had said. I,81
NA,be always listen to the remarks of the honourable,81
NA,"member who follows me in a debate, irrespective",81
NA,"of the mentality of the person, which in this case",81
NA,he will was not very high.,81
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order!,81
Mr YOUNG, I would have waited to listen to,81
NA,"before the honourable member's address, but I was",81
NA,a called out of the chamber by a number of mem-,81
NA,bers of the Press Gallery and radio and media,81
NA,representatives who wanted to speak to me,81
NA,about the speech I had made. As soon as I had,81
NA,"completed my discussions with the Press, I re-",81
NA,"entered the chamber, unfortunately, to listen to",81
NA,hardthe honourable member for Griffith.,81
NA,"Mr Donald Cameron- I raise a point of order,",81
NA,be Mr Deputy Speaker. If that is the best the,81
NA,to honourable member for Port Adelaide can do to,81
NA,"explain his temporary absence, the people can",81
NA,of correction judge for themselves.,81
NA,Sitting suspended from 5.56 to 8 p.m.,81
Mr STEWART ,Lang) (8.0)-The honour-,81
NA,pohable member for Griffith ( Mr Donald Cameron),81
NA,Parfinished speaking before the suspension of the,81
NA,sitting for dinner. He said that when the Labor,81
NA,Party took over government at the end of 1972 it,81
NA,was left with minor ills by the previous Liberal-,81
NA,and Country Party Government. I suggest that he,81
NA,a look at history. One of the main reasons we were,81
NA,left with major ills was the fact that from 1969,82
NA,1974 the Liberal Party had four leaders. In 1969,82
NA,Senator John Gorton resigned from the Senate,82
NA,contest the leadership of the Liberal Party,82
NA,the Prime Ministership- a clear indication that,82
NA,this House at that time there was not one,82
NA,ber of the Liberal Party who had the ability,82
NA,become Prime Minister of Austraha. Sir John,82
NA,Gorton was Prime Minister from 1969 to some,82
NA,time in 1971 when on an even vote in the Liberalcapital,82
NA,Party rooms he was deposed. He stood down,82
NA,from his office. His place was taken by the right,82
NA,honourable member for Lowe ( Sir William that,82
NA,MCMahon). He lasted until after the 1972 eleca,82
NA,"tion. Then you, Sir, took over leadership",82
NA,then Opposition.,82
NA,You lasted until after the 1974 election.,82
NA,are down in history as saying: T have no troublesof,82
NA,with my leadership. All my colleagues would,82
NA,walk over hot coals for me.' The present Prime,82
NA,"Mimster ( Mr Malcolm Fraser), who stabbed you",82
NA,"in the back, had stated publicly his utmost",82
NA,loyalty to you-,82
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The honourable National,82
NA,gentleman will not reflect upon another member,82
NA,of the House.,82
Mr STEWART, I thought I was most careful,82
NA,with my language.,82
Mr SPEAKER,You were not. You were,82
NA,reflecting on another member of the House. I ask decry,82
NA,you to withdraw.,82
Mr STEWART, I withdraw whatever reflec-,82
NA,"tion I made. In 1975, after a very strange set of of Those",82
NA,circumstances leading up to that,82
NA,present Prime Mimster assumed office. One of They,82
NA,the honourable members he appointed to his towards,82
NA,Ministry was the honourable member for Curtin interests,82
NA,( Mr Garland). Shortly after his appointment to and,82
NA,the Ministry he resigned because he was under a,82
NA,cloud. I understand from good authority that he,82
NA,had a definite promise of reinstatement to the,82
NA,Ministry. But when the next vacancy in the Minblame,82
NA,"istry occurred, the present Minister for Proopen",82
NA,"ductivity, the honourable member for Balaclava",82
NA,( Mr MCPhee) was appointed. The honourable the,82
NA,"member for Farrer ( Mr Fife), now the Minister",82
NA,"for Business and Consumer Affairs, was number",82
NA,appointed to the next vacancy. It was not until,82
NA,the third vacancy in the Ministry occurred that,82
NA,the honourable member for Curtin was reapUnion,82
NA,pointed. He had been discharged by a court,82
NA,the Prime Minister still made him serve his states:,82
NA,18-month sentence.,82
NA,Because of the warfare going on in the Liberal an,82
NA,Party between 1969 and late 1972 the economy of,82
NA,to was allowed to run down. Members of the Lib-,82
NA,eral Party were more interested in the leadership,82
NA,to battle and betraying each other. Between 1965,82
NA,and and 1972 the economy gotrightout of control.,82
NA,in The multinationals were running our country.,82
NA,memThere were no guideUnes on overseas invest-,82
NA,to ments. There was no control of the ownership of,82
NA,our resources. People are now recognising that in,82
NA,1965 we were over-producing. Too much foreign,82
NA,was coming mto the country. Unemploy-,82
NA,ment and inflation had already commenced.,82
NA,When the honourable member for Griffith states,82
NA,in 1972 when Labor took office we had only,82
NA,few minor Uls I suggest again that he look at the,82
NA,of the economic record between 1965 and 1972.,82
NA,Many honourable members on both sides of,82
NA,You the House have spoken during the Budget debate,82
NA,the need for co-operation between govern-,82
NA,"ment, employers and employees. The Govern-",82
NA,ment side of the House places the blame for,82
NA,everything on the unions and the workers. Bob,82
NA,Hawke's most conciliatory statements are,82
NA,answered by the Prime Minister and other Minis-,82
NA,ters with insults. The Deputy Leader of the,82
NA,Country Party ( Mr Sinclair) is now,82
NA,infamous for his remarks about the British dis-,82
NA,ease. So that I do not misquote him I shall read,82
NA,from his speech to the South Australian Branch,82
NA,of the National Country Party on 5 August 1977.,82
NA,He said:,82
NA,While on the subject of industrial disputes I must also,82
NA,the fact that so many British migrants seem bent on,82
NA,importing the 'British disease' into the Australian trade,82
NA,union movement.,82
NA,people have obviously sapped much of the strength,82
NA,"British industiy, leaving the British economy one of the",82
NA,"election, the weakest in Europe.",82
NA,are seemingly adopting the same atutudes and views,82
NA,the Australian trade union movement. Their,82
NA,"are not Australia, their origins are not Australian,",82
NA,them.,82
NA,one wonders whether acdon should not be taken against,82
NA,I note that he has toned down his remarks in the,82
NA,last few days. I suggest that unionists are not to,82
NA,for all the diseases of Australia today. The,82
NA,confrontation by this Government and the,82
NA,Queensland Government wUl be responsible for,82
NA,blood on our streets if this ever happens. I,82
NA,shall place on record some statistics on the,82
NA,of trade unionists in our work force. The,82
NA,reference is a document issued by the Australian,82
NA,Bureau of Statistics in June 1977 headed 'Trade,82
NA,Statistics: Austraha December 1976'. In,82
NA,but that document the definition of trade unions,82
NA,For the purpose of the statistics a trade union is defined as,82
NA,"organisation, consisting predominantly of employees, the",82
NA,principal activities of which include the negouauon of rates,82
NA,pay and conditions of employment for its members.,82
NA,The total number of employees in the AustraUan,83
NA,work force at May 1977- 1 obtained these figuresviolent,83
NA,from the Parliamentary Library tbis eveningworkers,83
NA,"was 6,199,500. This is made up of 3,994,900",83
NA,"males and 2,204,600 females. According to the",83
NA,document from which I read the membership of,83
NA,"unions in December 1976 was 1,950,600 males",83
NA,"and 841,300 females, and total of 2,791,900.",83
NA,From December 1975 to December 1976 there ment.,83
NA,was a decline in male union membership of 0.8,83
NA,"per cent, and the same percentage decline",83
NA,"pUed in female union membership, making a de-",83
NA,cline in union membership of 0.8 per cent,83
NA,12 months of 1976. The percentages are well,83
NA,worth citing. In 1976 63 per cent of males and,83
NA,per cent of females in the work force were in,83
NA,"trade unions, the total number of persons in the",83
NA,work force in trade unions being 57 per cent.,83
NA,"That means that 43 per cent of the 6,199,500",83
NA,persons in the Austrahan work force are not in,83
NA,trade union covering their calling.,83
NA,Forty-three per cent of them do not contribute,83
NA,to a fighting fund; they do not attend a stop,83
NA,meedng or a union meedng; they do not vote in,83
NA,union election; a number of those 43 per cent,83
NA,claim that industrial action is,83
NA,"their union being communist controlled, un-",83
NA,"democratic or inefficiently managed, yet they",83
NA,complain about their rates of pay and conditions,83
NA,of employment. But those same 43 per cent who towards,83
NA,are not in a trade union wUl accept any increase,83
NA,"in pay, any reduction in working hours, I see",83
NA,"improved sick leave, longer annual holidays,",83
NA,"ter long service leave, improved retirement",83
NA,"benefits, safer working conditions, improved",83
NA,"amenities at their work place, and more pleasant",83
NA,and comfortable workmg conditions. Some of,83
NA,my previous remarks apply also to people who,83
NA,are in a union but who take no part at all in,83
NA,management or control of their union. If there,83
NA,anything wrong with our trade unions it is,83
NA,by the apathy of many unionists who are,83
NA,"active unionists, but more particularly it is caused",83
NA,"by non-unionists in our work force, not by the",83
NA,importation of any ethnic disease.,83
NA,This is the second Budget introduced by the,83
NA,Treasurer ( Mr Lynch). In the Budget the can,83
NA,Government is claiming a great deal of credit,83
NA,the success of the first Budget. But the real,83
NA,ition is very much to the contrary. There are,83
NA,more complaints from all sections of the comcapitalism,83
NA,munity than there were during the whole of the,83
NA,Labor Government's reign. Honourable memStreet,83
NA,bers on the Government benches laugh. They,83
NA,laugh because they do not mix with the people,83
NA,their electorates. They are not even game,83
NA,to mix with the primary industry leaders or,83
NA,manufacturing industry leaders. There is more,83
NA,complaint in the community today from,83
NA,"and unionists, employers organisations,",83
NA,"manufacturers, farmers, small business men,",83
NA,"educationists, environmentaUsts, State govern-",83
NA,"ments, local governments, migrants and recipi-",83
NA,ents of social security benefits than there ever,83
NA,was during the three years of Labor Govern-,83
NA,It is because this Government that came in,83
NA,on a host of promises has not kept pace with the,83
NA,apexpectations of the Austrahan people.,83
NA,in the Much of the worthy and long outstanding,83
NA,social legislation introduced by the Labor,83
NA,47 Government has been curtaUed or allowed to,83
NA,stagnate. Fraser's federalism has not been ac-,83
NA,cepted by the State governments. The Australian,83
NA,Assistance Plan and grants for leisure facUities,83
NA,have been canceUed and the co-operation of,83
NA,a local government has been lost. Labor's welfare,83
NA,programs were meant to be on a continumg,83
NA,basis. They certainly would have been amended,83
NA,"and improved with experience of their operation,",83
NA,workbut they were not designed to be turned on and,83
NA,aoff like a tap. On 25 February 1976 in my speech,83
NA,"m the Address-in-Reply debate, at page 300 of",83
NA,"useless; they talk ofHansard, I said:",83
NA,I suggest to all honourable members opposite that they,83
NA,should recognise that this country is already heading,83
NA,"an unemployment figure of between 500,000 and",83
NA,"750,000 people.",83
NA,no reason at all to change my prediction be-,83
NA,betcause this Government still has the same disas-,83
NA,trous policies it commenced in January 1976.,83
NA,The determination of the Government to attain,83
NA,what the Treasurer calls its first goal-t o mam-,83
NA,tain the underlying trend to lower mflation-ca n,83
NA,be tested by the sudden decision to alter the,83
NA,the income tax averaging provisions for rural pro-,83
NA,is ducers. Let me quote from page 33 of Statement,83
NA,causedNo. 2 attached to the Budget Papers where,83
NA,not under the heading' Assumptions' it says:,83
NA,"Apart from the Budget proposals themselves, there will be",83
NA,no new fiscal measures during 1977-78.,83
NA,Not even the Treasurer in his most verbose style,83
NA,suggest that this is not a fiscal change. This,83
NA,for change is made before the ink on the Budget,83
NA,posPapers is even dry. We are heading into the hal-,83
NA,"cyon days of 1965 to 1972, with laissez-faire",83
NA,"again taking over, with the pressure",83
NA,groups in the community-th e Pitt and Collins,83
NA,farmers-forcin g the Government within a,83
NA,"matter of days to introduce a newfiscalmeasure,",83
NA,inwhen there is a clear statement in the Budget,83
NA,enough Papers that there would be no new fiscal,83
NA,the measures during 1977-78. The Government has,83
NA,not turned on the lights. It has created black mis-,84
NA,ery for many workers. It has switched off the con-,84
NA,fidence of manufacturers and it has blacked out,84
NA,the hopes and aspirations of young Austraha.,84
NA,Suspension of Standing Orders,84
NA,Motion (by Mr Nixon)-b y leave-agree d to:,84
NA,That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended,84
NA,would prevent the Prime Minister speaking for a period,84
NA,exceeding 45 minutes.,84
Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,Wannon-Prime per,84
NA,Minister) (8.19)-Th e honourable member for,84
NA,Lang ( Mr Stewart) has just concluded what one,84
NA,"must certainly judge, by the standards of the Op-",84
NA,"position, to be a good fighting speech for the",84
NA,position. I think that the House,84
NA,quaUty of the Opposition's contribution to the,84
NA,debate on the Budget by that speech.,84
NA,words one could use of it would be that,84
NA,"humdrum, slighdy duU and not particularly people",84
NA,accurate.,84
NA,The Budget brought down by the Treasurer,84
NA,( Mr Lynch) consolidates and advances the,84
NA,achievements which the Government has,84
NA,already made in fighting inflation and restoring,84
NA,healthy economy to Australia. For the second,84
NA,"time, we have a Budget which reduces the deficit",84
NA,"by over half a bUUon dollars,firmlycontrols",84
NA,"rate of increase in Government spending,",84
NA,creates the conditions for a further reduction,84
NA,inflation and further economic growth. At the,84
NA,same time it increases assistance to those,84
NA,need.,84
NA,Because the Government held its spending,84
NA,within zero real growth as was predicted,84
NA,"beginning of this calender year, Australia could",84
NA,"afford a major tax reform, under",84
NA,wage and salary earner's take-home pay,84
NA,"from 1 February. As a result of this tax reform,",84
NA,taxpayers wUl save $406m this year. Together,84
NA,"with tax indexation, their tax savings this",84
NA,"wUl total $ 1,371m. In 1978-79, taxpayers wUl",84
NA,"save $ 1,390m from the tax reform. Together",84
NA,"with $467m from half tax indexation, they wUl",84
NA,"be saving $ 1,857m. Had there",84
NA,"reform, the benefits to taxpayers would have",84
NA,been $973m less in 1978-79.,84
NA,This reform was achieved whUe at the same,84
NA,time maintaining our commitment to protect,84
NA,"pensions against inflation. In their desperation,",84
NA,Labor tried to conceal the benefits of this Budget,84
NA,from the AustraUan people. It pretended,84
NA,were no tax cuts at all. I have a simple offer,84
NA,make to those members of the Opposition who,84
NA,claim to disbelieve the reality of the tax cuts.,84
NA,them volunteer to refund their supposedly nonnew,84
NA,existent tax cuts to consoliated revenue. By doing,84
NA,"so, they wiU make thefirstcontribution that any",84
NA,of them ever has made to lowering the size of the,84
NA,deficit.,84
NA,Had this Budget's tax reforms not been so fun-,84
NA,"damental, one might have sympathised a Uttle",84
NA,with the Opposition's unwillingness to admit that,84
NA,major tax reforms could be made. Under the,84
NA,"as Hayden reforms a taxpayer without dependants,",84
NA,not whose concessional allowances had been equal,84
NA,"to 10 per cent of his net income, paid $60, or 17.6",84
NA,cent more tax in 1975-76 if his income was,84
NA,"$4,000, socking the person with $4,000 income",84
NA,an extra 17.6 per cent. But if his income was,84
NA,"$5,000 he paid $ 120, or 21.8 per cent more tax. If",84
NA,"Ophis income was $6,000 he paid $212, or 26.2 per",84
NA,can judge the cent more in tax.,84
The kindest Mr BAUME ,Tha t is not the rich.,84
Mr MALCOLM FRASER,"No, he socked",84
NA,at the lowest end of the income scales and,84
NA,quite deUberately increased their tax. Some,84
NA,reform-som e Treasurer. The Hayden scheme,84
NA,"hit the farmer particularly hard. In fact, many",84
NA,farmers withfluctuatingincomes paid more tax,84
NA,a under the Hayden system with its misnamed,84
NA,general concessional rebate than wage earners,84
NA,with the same average income. Let me give one,84
NA,"the example. Under the pre-Budget scale, the",84
NA,"and indexed Hayden scale, a wage earner on an",84
NA,"in income of $10,000 would pay $2,147 a year tax.",84
NA,A farmer who had been on that income for some,84
NA,"most inyears and who then had income of nothing,",84
NA,"$20,000 and $10,000, maintaining an average",84
NA,"income of $10,000 as was the wage earner,",84
NA,"would pay a total of $1,467 more tax than the",84
NA,at the wage earner in a three year period.,84
which every Mr BAUME ,Disgraceful .,84
Mr MALCOLM FRASER,The honourable,84
NA,gentleman has used the word 'disgraceful'. It,84
NA,should be conceded that under the so-called,84
NA,"year Hayden tax reforms, all taxpayers did have",84
NA,something to look forward to-taxe s which con-,84
NA,"tinually increased, because the Whitlam Govern-",84
NA,ment would not even commit itself to indexing its,84
NA,been no new tax new tax rates.,84
NA,"Over the past few months, the perpetrators of",84
NA,that tax hoax have enlightened us with further,84
NA,examples of theirfinegrasp of basic economic,84
NA,principles. At the Perth Australian Labor Party,84
NA,"Conference, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr",84
NA,"E. G. Whitlam), in a blindingflashof insight,",84
NA,there uncovered a novel intellectual concept-,84
NA,to 'economic responsibiUty'. This had unfortun-,84
NA,ately evaded him for the three years in which he,84
NA,Let was in government. The strain of grasping this,84
NA,idea was so great that once he had given his,84
NA,speech and the Labor Party began its economic,84
NA,"debate, the Leader of the Opposition proceeded",85
NA,to read the newspapers and ignore what had,85
NA,"happened. Having thus rested, he returned to",85
NA,"fray a few weeks later, on 20 July, at the",85
NA,National Press Club. He put forward the Labor,85
NA,Party's new economic plan-mor e government,85
NA,spending and a larger deficit. What a revoluthat,85
NA,tionary break with Labor tradition that was.,85
NA,"Unfortunately, he spoiled it all by concluding",85
NA,that 'Labor offers Australia a long haul back,85
NA,prosperity'. The Australian people know,85
NA,fectly well how long that haul would be.,85
NA,"Then on 11 August, just three weeks later,",85
NA,Labor unveiled with great fanfare its so-called,85
NA,'Proposal to get Austraha working again'. Its,85
NA,authors were the Leader of the Opposition and,85
NA,the honourable member for Oxley ( Mr Hayden),85
NA,-someho w the shadow Treasurer was lost in the,85
NA,shuffle. This document declared that 'it should,85
NA,"not be represented as an alternative Budget, but expected.",85
NA,rather as a set of measures to be included in the,85
NA,Budget'. This modesty was becoming-bu t then,85
NA,no party has more to be modest about. It certribution,85
NA,tainly was not an alternative Budget. What,85
NA,sought was an increased expenditure of $800m.,85
NA,Taken together with Labor's opposition to our,85
NA,"policies to restrain government expenditure,",85
NA,clear that they were contemplating a deficit,85
NA,$3.5 btilion or more-a t the least a 50 per,85
NA,increase over the $2.2 bilUon we have budgeted,85
NA,"for this year, a deficit which would bring higher",85
NA,interest rates and higher inflation.,85
NA,The Opposition now says such huge expendicompletely,85
NA,ture on Government programs is the only way,85
NA,knows of reducing unemployment. But in 1975,85
NA,the honourable member for Oxley had to terminwas,85
NA,ate a scheme strikingly similar to this so-called,85
NA,new proposal-th e notorious Regional,85
NA,ment and Development scheme. Labor ter-,85
NA,minated the RED scheme because it was,85
NA,inefficient and ineffective- a scheme which cost,85
NA,"$180m but employed an average of only 13,000",85
NA,people. The Labor Party's proposal is in the,85
NA,finest tradition of Labor economics-i t holds,85
NA,the prospect of gravely damaging Australia.,85
NA,The next step in the Opposition's carefully,85
NA,thought out economic offensive took place a lars,85
NA,"week later, after the Budget. On 18 August,",85
NA,"Leader of the Opposition, and Labor's joint-",85
NA,"divided shadow Treasurers, the honourable",85
NA,member for Adelaide ( Mr Hurford) and the ment,85
NA,"honourable member for Oxley, held a very",85
NA,instructive Press conference. It showed the Labor,85
NA,Party's superb approach to economic poUcy three years.,85
NA,"making, the machine-like precision with which",85
NA,the Labor Party's economic manager and Opposition,85
NA,shadow Treasurer work together. The honour-,85
NA,able member for Oxley said that the Labor Party,85
NA,"the had no commitment to personal tax indexation,",85
NA,but the honourable member for Adelaide admit-,85
NA,ted that personal tax indexation was Labor Party,85
NA,pohcy. The honourable member for Oxley said,85
NA,the Labor Party did not commit itself to our,85
NA,"tax reforms, but the honourable member for",85
NA,Adelaide seemed to rule out the scheme entirely.,85
NA,to The honourable member for Oxley said that he,85
NA,"percould make some definite calculations, a",85
NA,remarkable admission. The honourable member,85
NA,"for Adelaide, even more remarkably, said he",85
NA,could not. One commentator who was present,85
NA,"was unkind enough to say that 'Messrs Whitlam,",85
NA,Hayden and Hurford resembled not so much the,85
NA,"three wise monkeys as Donald Duck's nephews,",85
NA,"Huey, Dewey, and Louey'. WeU, after aU, the",85
NA,Labor Party has been living in fantasyland for so,85
NA,long that a touch of unreality was only to be,85
NA,But the high spot of the Labor Party's con-,85
NA,to economic theory and practice had,85
NA,it not yet been reached. The climax-th e great,85
NA,moment-wa s the Leader of the Opposition's,85
NA,reply to the Budget- a reply which contained,85
NA,"it is nothing constructive, nothing of substance,",85
NA,of which had forgotten the economic plan of some,85
NA,cent days before. It was a reply that some people,85
NA,described as full oftiredand empty rhetonc. The,85
NA,Leader of the Opposition's speech was full of,85
NA,yesterday's delusions-yesterday' s words uttered,85
NA,by yesterday's man. But to dismiss the speech as,85
NA,devoid of meaning is to ignore the,85
NA,it Leader of the Opposition's most revealmg,85
NA,"remark, that Labor's alternative to the Budget",85
NA,'implicit' in aU that he had been saying;,85
NA,impUcit m aU his criticisms of our restraint m,85
NA,Employspending Australian's tax doUars.,85
NA,It is clear that the Leader of the Opposition,85
NA,wants a return to the days when government,85
NA,spending was utterly unrestrained. He wants a,85
NA,return to the unrealistic and destructive poUcies,85
NA,that Labor pursued for three years. In its econ-,85
NA,outomic plan it was spending an extra $800m. If in,85
NA,all the programs he criticised in his speech in this,85
NA,Budget debate he was going to spend more dol-,85
NA,"again, how many hundreds of millions of",85
NA,the doUars more than that $800m would he have,85
NA,E sured out on to the market over the period? The,85
NA,abor Government's poUcies increased govern-,85
NA,expenditure by 115 per cent. Those poUcies,85
NA,resulted in unemployment being trebled in one,85
NA,year and the rate of mflation being trebled in,85
NA,At the National Press Club the Leader of the,85
NA,said that the Labor Government had,85
NA,made mistakes. That was modest. He said that,86
NA,the Austrahan Labor Party henceforth would,86
NA,walk the path of economic responsibihty. What,86
NA,responsibihty? He and the party he leads are,86
NA,economic incompetents. That is why the Auscharges,86
NA,trahan people voted them into opposidon. That,86
NA,is why the Austrahan people will keep them in,86
NA,opposidon.,86
Mr LES MCMAHON ,Nam e the date,86
NA,elecuon.,86
Mr MALCOLM FRASER,We will see how,86
NA,bold the Opposition is when the day comes. In,86
NA,this Budget we again have re-examined GovernAustraUans,86
NA,ment programs to ensure that funds raised,86
NA,taxpayers are being used with the greatest,86
NA,efficiency and to the greatest effect. All,86
NA,traUans have a big stake in making government,86
NA,"more efficient and less costly, for efficient",86
NA,ment means stronger and more highly motivatedreform,86
NA,government and lower taxation for all Auspersonal,86
NA,traUans. The Budget represents a major step,86
NA,making government more efficient and achieving,86
NA,"the lowest taxation possible, consistent with",86
NA,sound and strong government.,86
NA,Through our efforts in reappraising governand,86
NA,"ment programs, we have held the real rate of",86
NA,growtn in government spending to zero. That is income.,86
NA,what the Treasurer predicted and promised,86
NA,many months ago. Yet at the sametimewe have,86
NA,provided large increases in payments to the,86
NA,States and local government. In those States,86
NA,which have already brought down their Budgets,86
NA,"we can see the benefit of our generosity, because",86
NA,they all have made very substantial concessions,86
NA,and basicaUy have not increased taxes. They this Budget.,86
NA,could not have done it had it not been for the,86
NA,increased financial reimbursement grants from,86
NA,the Commonwealth.,86
NA,At the same time we have given high priority mentioned,86
NA,"to programs for relieving unemployment,",86
NA,especially for the young. The financial Umit is off there,86
NA,those programs. If there is a training oppormarginal,86
NA,"tunity, it wtil be provided. There is increased earned.",86
NA,social security and welfare,86
NA,13 per cent. The Budget gives high priority to prehensivethe,86
NA,providing effective assistance to,86
NA,need. The automatic adjustment of social,86
NA,ity pensions and benefits will result in increases accord with the Mathews Committee's,86
NA,"in November, and again in May 1978, and reclusion",86
NA,patriation disabiUty pensions and Service pentax,86
NA,sions wtilrisein the same way. We have achieved,86
NA,"all this, and reformed the tax scales, without",86
NA,"increasing postal charges or the duties on beer, decisions.",86
NA,spirits and cigarettes.,86
Mr LES MCMAHON ,Yo u are a fraud.,86
Mr MALCOLM FRASER,Does the honour-,86
NA,able member for Sydney want the tax on beer,86
NA,increased? Let him say that in his electorate. This,86
NA,is the second consecutive Budget in which these,86
NA,have not been increased. That should be,86
NA,contrasted with Labor's record. It increased,86
NA,indirect taxes in two out ofits three Budgets. As a,86
NA,"result, in 1975-76 collections of indirect taxes",86
NA,were $2.2 bilUon-abou t 90 per cent greater than,86
NA,of the they had been in 1972-73.,86
NA,It was our firmness in restraining government,86
NA,expenditure which enabled the Government to,86
NA,introduce substantial cuts in personal income tax.,86
NA,want to have greater freedom to,86
NA,frommake their own decisions about spending and,86
NA,"saving, and this Government is committed to",86
NA,Ausproviding the conditions under which the best,86
NA,efforts of all wtil be encouraged-no t stifled by,86
NA,govern-excessive taxes. That is why we promised to,86
NA,the tax system. Last year we brought in,86
NA,tax indexation and major reforms for,86
NA,in corporate taxpayers. This year we have made the,86
NA,most revolutionary change yet made to,86
NA,Australia's system of personal income tax. The,86
NA,new personal taxation measures restore the,86
NA,incentive to work harder and more productively,86
NA,to earn more. They give people the power to,86
NA,decide how to spend a greater proportion of their,86
NA,The new tax system accords with the views of,86
NA,most taxation poUcy experts. The Labor Govern-,86
NA,"ment received many reports from committees,",86
NA,commissions and task forces bearing on taxation,86
NA,"pohcy. Overwhelmingly, they support the main",86
NA,features of the personal tax system introduced in,86
NA,The new tax system's first feature is that there,86
NA,are tax cuts for people at aU income levels-ther e,86
NA,are none of the detriment cases of the kind I,86
NA,and for the,86
NA,in relation to the Hayden tax scales-,86
NA,vast majority of fuUtimeworkers,86
NA,is also a reduction m the excessively high,86
NA,"tax rates; that is, a reduction in the",86
NA,extra tax payable on each extra dollar of income,86
NA,These changes accord with the main,86
NA,spending. It is up by finding of,86
NA,Asprey Committee-th e most com-,86
NA,review of Australia's taxation system,86
NA,those most in for 40 years-tha t the,86
NA,securtoo heavily on personalAustralian income,86
NA,tax system relies,86
NA,tax. The changes,86
NA,con-,86
NA,thatrisingmarginal tax rates encourage,86
NA,avoidance and evasion and may lead to sub-,86
NA,stantial economic waste because tax avoidance,86
NA,becomes a basis of investment and employment,86
NA,"The House wUl, I hope, recall that the",86
NA,ACTU's industrial advocate was a member of,86
NA,"the Mathews Committee. The new tax system, by",86
NA,fostering skill and encouraging the acceptance of,87
NA,"responsibihty, heeds the warning of the Jackson",87
NA,Committee that a society 'neglects at its peril,87
NA,rewards for skill and responsibihty'. The Jackson,87
NA,Committee concluded:,87
NA,We have a general impression that reward differentials,87
NA,"after tax are decreasing, and may no longer be sufficient",87
NA,encourage individual effort and enterprise rn industry.,87
NA,The House will recall that the President of the,87
NA,ACTU and of the ALP was one of the authors of,87
NA,that report.,87
NA,The new system's second feature is that it,87
NA,introduces a tax-free area at the base of every,87
NA,"taxpayer's income of $3,750, or about $72 a",87
NA,week. This replacement of the so-called general,87
NA,concessional rebate introduced in the Hayden,87
NA,Budget of 1975 accords with the Asprey Com-,87
NA,mittee's recommendations. Just a few months,87
NA,before the previous Government introduced the,87
NA,notoriously misleading general concessional re-,87
NA,"bate, the Asprey Committee had described such",87
NA,rebates as confusing. It reported:,87
NA,The amount of tax to be levied on low incomes should not,87
NA,be obscured by artificialities.,87
NA,Artificialities were what the Opposition's last,87
NA,Budget was all about-artificialitie s that tried to,87
NA,hide the massive tax increases which the Hayden,87
NA,Budget inflicted on many taxpayers on low,87
NA,incomes. There are no such artificialities in this,87
NA,Budget.,87
NA,The new tax system's third feature is that it,87
NA,establishes one tax rate-3 2 per cent-a s the,87
NA,basic rate of taxation paid by the vast majority of,87
NA,taxpayers. The Leader of the Opposition's claim,87
NA,that this abandons progressive taxation is com-,87
NA,pletely untrue. Under the new tax system the,87
NA,"higher a person's income, the higher the pro-",87
NA,S ortion he will pay in tax. Because the first,87
NA,"3,750 of everyone's income is tax free, a tax-",87
NA,payer on any given level of income will pay a,87
NA,higher proportion ofhis total income in tax than,87
NA,a taxpayer who has a lower income but whose,87
NA,circumstances are similar in other respects. A tax-,87
NA,"payer, with no dependants and no other deduc-",87
NA,"tions or rebates, at an income of $5,000 wtil pay",87
NA,"8 per cent of his income in tax; at $ 10,000,20 per",87
NA,"cent; at $15,000, 24 per cent; at $20,000, 29 per",87
NA,"cent; and at $50,000, 44 per cent. At the same",87
NA,"time, under this system 90 per cent of taxpayers",87
NA,pay the same amount of extra tax on each extra,87
NA,dollar of income. This principle was supported,87
NA,by Professor Henderson's Commission of,87
NA,Inquiry into Poverty and by the Priorities Review,87
NA,"Staff report on social welfare pohcy. Moreover,",87
NA,the Asprey Committee took the following view:,87
NA,"Over the middle band ofincome and wealth, the band in",87
NA,"which the great majority of them spend their lives, most Aus-",87
NA,tralians wul accept as fair and convenient an approximately,87
NA,proportional taxation system.,87
NA,"Fourthly, the new system imposes tax surcharges",87
NA,on taxpayers with the highest incomes but,87
NA,to reduces the rate on the highest incomes from the,87
NA,present 65 per cent to 60 per cent. This also,87
NA,accords with the recommendations of the Com-,87
NA,"mission of Inquiry into Poverty, and 60 per cent",87
NA,was in fact the maximum marginal rate that Pro-,87
NA,fessor Henderson suggested. The Asprey Com-,87
NA,"mittee went even further, and suggested that an",87
NA,appropriate long term target would be reducing,87
NA,the highest marginal tax scales to 50 per cent.,87
NA,The new tax arrangements are in line with pro-,87
NA,fessional opinion on the best tax system for,87
NA,Austraha. Those who clamoured for reductions,87
NA,"in marginal tax rates before the Budget, but who",87
NA,now complain because taxpayers on high,87
NA,"incomes get the largest reductions, are refusing",87
NA,to face an inescapable fact-th e fact that reduc-,87
NA,tions in rates of taxation for those with low tax-,87
NA,"able income, automatically reduce the taxes paid",87
NA,by those with higher incomes. Those who believe,87
NA,that tax reductions on high incomes should have,87
NA,"been less, should tell us at what income levels",87
NA,they believe marginal rates should have been,87
NA,higher. It may be helpful if I mention that the,87
NA,cost to revenue of a reduction of one percentage,87
NA,point is over $300m in respect of the standard,87
NA,"rate of tax of 32 per cent, less than $30m in",87
NA,"respect ofthe 46 per cent rate, and about $1 lm",87
NA,in respect of the 60 per cent marginal tax rate.,87
NA,Had the Government rejected the recommenda-,87
NA,tions of expert inquiries and left the maximum,87
NA,"marginal tax rate at 65 per cent, at best the",87
NA,amount saved would only have enabled us to,87
NA,reduce further the standard 32 per cent rate of,87
NA,"taxation by one-fifth of a percentage point, from",87
NA,32 per cent to 31.8 per cent.,87
NA,The Opposition's wilful misrepresentation of,87
NA,"the tax reforms, its attempts to set Australians",87
NA,against Australians by talking about a 'class,87
NA,"Budget', will not alter the fact that all people wtil",87
NA,"benefit and, proportionately, people on the",87
NA,lowest incomes will benefit most of all. Tax-,87
NA,"payers with a dependent spouse earning $7,000 a",87
NA,year will save 33 per cent in tax. Those earning,87
NA,"$8,000 a year will save 25 per cent. On $18,000 a",87
NA,"year, they wtil save 20 per cent in tax. Taxpayers",87
NA,whose incomesfluctuatewill be more fairly,87
NA,"treated, and primary producers will have the",87
NA,added benefit ofthe new tax averaging arrange-,87
NA,ments announced recently by the Treasurer. Pri-,87
NA,"mary producers withfluctuatingincomes, who",87
NA,were disadvantaged under the Hayden tax systhe,88
NA,"tem, will no longer pay more tax than other",88
NA,payers with the same average income.,88
NA,"As the Asprey Committee pointed out, the",88
NA,averaging system has operated harshly on keep,88
NA,farmers with falling incomes. The Government's,88
NA,new tax averaging system will especially assist rates.,88
NA,"these farmers. For example, a farmer with tax-",88
NA,"able income of $4,000 but with an average",88
NA,"income of $10,000 would have paid $453 tax",88
NA,under the pre-Budget scale. Under the simplified,88
NA,"scale and the new averaging system, his annual",88
NA,tax will be $80-th e same as a wage earner,88
NA,"an income of $4,000. A farmer with a taxable",88
NA,"income of $8,000 but with an average income of",88
NA,"$10,000 would have paid $1,583 in tax. Under",88
NA,"the new arrangements, his annual tax liability",88
NA,"will be $ 1,360, the same as a wage earner with an",88
NA,"income of $8,000. This is a reduction of $223",88
NA,tax.,88
NA,These savings are significant. They will,88
NA,remove the harshness identified by the Asprey,88
NA,Committee which farmers with falling,88
NA,"have experienced. At the same time, these",88
NA,"measures will have negligible cost in 1977-78, stituting",88
NA,and will therefore not affect the Budget's econ-,88
NA,omic strategy. The new tax system is,88
NA,fairer than any system of personal tax Austraha,88
NA,has had before. The Oppposition's campaign to,88
NA,confuse taxpayers will fail. Taxpayers wtil of,88
NA,course learn about the new tax system in the,88
NA,most direct way.,88
NA,"On 1 July 1976 and 1 July 1977, all wage",88
NA,salary earners became aware about tax indexaAll,88
NA,tion when there were reductions in the tax,88
NA,"deducted from their pay. On 1 February 1978,",88
NA,there will be another reduction in tax reductions,88
NA,from pay packets. On 1 July 1978 there will,88
NA,yet another reduction in the tax deducted from,88
NA,"pay packets, and every wage and salary earner",88
NA,will benefit. Let me emphasise again the simple,88
NA,truth of the historic tax reforms this Budget,88
NA,introduced. No individual taxpayer will lose.,88
NA,Every individual taxpayer will gain. All taxConference.,88
NA,payers are protected against inflation.,88
NA,The Budget brought down by the Treasurer is,88
NA,a Budget in which efficiency and sensitivity in the,88
NA,government administration are at a premium. placed,88
NA,"With one decisive stroke, the Budget reforms passing",88
NA,and simplifies the personal tax system in such a at half the,88
NA,"way as to benefit everyone, to reward initiative",88
NA,"and enterprise for everyone, to encourage harder",88
NA,work and higher productivity by everyone. It,88
NA,further reinforces the constant pressure against,88
NA,inflation which the Government has exerted ever,88
NA,since coming to office. It provides a stimulus,88
NA,economy through a large increase in the dis-,88
NA,"taxposable incomes of all taxpayers, particularly",88
NA,after 1 February when pay-as-you-earn deduc-,88
NA,tions will be reduced. It protects the disadvan-,88
NA,taged by increasing pensions and benefits to,88
NA,pace with inflation. The lower deficit sets,88
NA,the scene for lower inflation and lower interest,88
NA,This Budget represents a funher stage in the,88
NA,economic policies we have employed throughout,88
NA,1976 and 1977. These pohcies wtil continue to,88
NA,establish the sound foundation for sustainable,88
NA,with economic growth and prosperity.,88

Mr HURFORD ,Adelaide) (8.47)-On be-,88
NA,incomes half of the Opposition I move:,88
NA,That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to sub-,88
NA,the following words:,88
NA,"'whilst not opposing the second reading of the Bill, the",88
NA,simpler and House is of the opinion that:,88
NA,(a) it reduces in real terms the funds available to the,88
NA,"States,",88
NA,"(b) it increases the States' borrowing costs,",88
NA,(c) it forces the States to reduce the services they pro-,88
NA,vide and/or to impose additional taxes and,88
NA,"charges, and",88
NA,and (d) it leads to increased unemployment'.,88
NA,those charges apply to the Budget which we,88
NA,have just heard the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm,88
NA,Fraser) huffing and puffing about and seeking to,88
NA,defend. The States Grants (Capital Assistance),88
NA,be Bill 1977 authorises the payment of the grants,88
NA,component of the State government Loan Coun-,88
NA,cil programs for the currentfinancialyear,88
NA,1977-78. Almost $500m is involved and this,88
NA,has represents approximately one-third of the total,88
NA,program agreed upon at the 1 July Premiers,88
NA,As well as this amount authority is,88
NA,given for the payment of grants for capital pur-,88
NA,poses in thisfinancialyear until the passage of,88
NA,authorising legislation for the year. A limit is,88
NA,on the amount of payment which can be,88
NA,made in 1978-79 without further legislation,88
NA,through this Parliament. This limit is set,88
NA,amount ofthe 1977-78 grants.,88
NA,This legislation is an intrinsic part of the,88
NA,Government's main policy thrusts since assum-,88
NA,ing office. I see two thrusts. They are tied up with,88
NA,the Government's so-called new federaUsm pol-,88
NA,to icy and with its supposed main anti-inflationary,88
NA,"weapon, namely, cutting government expendiinflation",89
NA,ture. It appears that the progress of new federalGovernment-the,89
NA,ism has been brought to an abrupt halt. The,89
NA,States find themselves unable to agree with mostamount,89
NA,of the Commonwealth's demands. The pohcy vices,89
NA,that was supposed to bring a new era of coState,89
NA,operation in Federal-State relations has brought,89
NA,nothing but acrimony and confusion. We will resources,89
NA,have a further example of this at the forthcomingend,89
NA,Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting,89
NA,which take place shortly.,89
NA,The much vaunted pohcy of giving States,89
NA,dubious freedom to raise their own income tax,89
NA,"has been rejected by New South Wales, to mentively",89
NA,"tion the people of just one State, who have",89
NA,given that opportunity so far. The people of,89
NA,South Australia will be given an opportunity,89
NA,Saturday and will similarly reject this Governto,89
NA,"ment's new federalism pohcy. They will vote in ing,",89
NA,the Dunstan Government by an overwhelming,89
NA,majority. Double taxation was a major issue,89
NA,the New South Wales election and when voters,89
NA,grasped the full import of what the conservatives,89
NA,who are runmng the Commonwealth at the has,89
NA,"presenttimewere trying to do, they rejected the",89
NA,Commonwealth's counterpart in the State. This,89
NA,will be the experience in South Austraha and,89
NA,more and more States as people realise how new,89
NA,federalism will affect them.,89
NA,Mr Groom-I s this the best you can do?,89
Mr HURFORD,The Government's attitude,89
NA,to the States can be summarised quite readily.,89
NA,heard an interjection from the honourable memhow,89
NA,ber for Braddon which is an electorate in Tasthrough,89
NA,"mania. Since he came into the Parliament,",89
NA,"porarily as a oncer, there has been a State",89
NA,tion in Tasmania and the people of Tasmania,89
NA,have overwhelmingly rejected double taxation,89
NA,as they will overwhelmingly reject him at the,89
NA,next opportunity. The Government's attitude to to What,89
NA,the States can be summarised quite readily. butanowhere,89
NA,Under its pohcies the States are to get more and mentioned inistheany,89
NA,more responsibilities and fewer and fewer the,89
NA,resources.,89
NA,The second reading speech of the Minister,89
NA,Aboriginal Affairs and Minister assisting the,89
NA,Treasurer ( Mr Viner) gives the impression that,89
NA,the States will receive a good deal under this,89
NA,Government. He admits that the grants which the,89
NA,are the subject of this Bill have been increased,89
NA,"less than 6 per cent. However, he does not spell",89
NA,"out that this means a drop in real terms in excessexample,",89
NA,of 6 per cent because in the Government's,89
NA,Budget Papers it admits to an inflation rate of,89
NA,per cent. So if one is getting an increase in,89
NA,terms of only 6 per cent at atimewhen there is an,89
NA,rate of 12 per cent-admitte d by the,89
NA,n there is a drop of 6 per cent in,89
NA,real terms. This means resources of that lesser,89
NA,wtil be applied to the States for the ser-,89
NA,of the people in those States through the,89
NA,governments. The Minister seeks to allevi-,89
NA,ate the concern of those interested in the,89
NA,available to the States by adding at the,89
NA,of his speech that the total of general pur-,89
NA,pose and loan funds is up 14 per cent on last,89
NA,financial year's level. This is another example of,89
NA,what I mentioned in the debate on the Local,89
NA,the Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing),89
NA,Amendment Bill. The Government is using selec-,89
NA,chosenfiguresto avoid taking responsi-,89
NA,beenbihty for what it has actually done. On some,89
NA,occasions itfindsmerit in its policy of cutting,89
NA,on Government spending but when it has to face up,89
NA,the results of cutting that Government spend-,89
NA,"as it has to do in a Bill such as this, it goes to",89
NA,water and we hear inane interjections from back,89
NA,in bench oncer members ofthe Parliament.,89
NA,It is undeniable that the present Government,89
NA,cut overall the real level of funds going to the,89
NA,"States; that is, the total of loans, general purpose",89
NA,and specific purpose funds haverisenby only 9,89
NA,in per cent thisfinancialyear compared with the,89
NA,previousfinancialyear. This amounts to a drop,89
NA,in real terms of 2 per cent to 3 per cent. We still,89
NA,hear honourable members on the Government,89
NA,side protesting. I repeat: At some stages the,89
NA,Governmentfindsmerit in cutting Government,89
NA,I spending but when it has to face the real facts of,89
NA,this means reduced services for the people,89
NA,"the pubhc sector, then the Government",89
NA,temprotests and pretends that that has not hap-,89
NA,elecpened. Honourable members on the Govern-,89
NA,ment side misrepresent what the Government is,89
NA,doing for the people of this country.,89
NA,the Government is doing here amounts,89
NA,"drop in real terms of 2 per cent to 3 per cent,",89
NA,mention made of this. It is not,89
NA,"Budget, it is not mentioned in",89
NA,second reading speech of the Minister and it,89
NA,has not been mentioned on any other occasion,89
NA,"for that I can remember. Once again, it is curious",89
NA,that a government so convinced of the necessity,89
NA,for cutting Government spending is not prepared,89
NA,to spell out how it is doing that. The estimate of,89
NA,drop in real terms of 2 per cent to 3 per cent,89
NA,by in funds available to the States probably illus-,89
NA,trates the real seriousness of the situation. For,89
NA,last year actual expenditure on specific,89
NA,purpose grants was some $125m less than,89
NA,12estimated in the Budget. There is no reason to,89
NA,moneysuggest that such an occurrence may not be,89
NA,repeated this year. Specific purpose grants for,89
NA,"1977-78, the currentfinancialyear, have already",90
NA,been cut by some 8 per cent in real terms comhave,90
NA,pared with the previousfinancialyear. It is worth,90
NA,examining some ofthe areas in which these,90
NA,are being made. Funds for pensioner dwellings,90
NA,are down some 18 per cent in real,90
NA,nal advancement programs are due to lose in real,90
NA,terms in excess of 16 per cent of funds. The,90
NA,pubhc transport allocation has been reduced,90
NA,25 per cent. Other urban programs such as those,90
NA,"for sewerage, land development and growth",90
NA,centres have virtually disappeared. In these areas,90
NA,"the States are not to get funds, which they",90
NA,"received, totalling in excess of $200m.",90
NA,Total funds going to the States in the current,90
NA,financial year are estimated to be about,90
NA,cent to 20 per cent in money terms above the,90
NA,level of 1975-76. But when account is taken of,90
NA,rise in the price level of 18 per cent to 25 per,90
NA,the treatment which the States have received federalism.,90
NA,from this Administration is put into stark,90
NA,"perspective. It is no wonder, with the new feder-",90
NA,alism policy meaning a reduction of some 5,90
NA,cent to 7 per cent in the real level of resources,90
NA,"available to the States, that the collapse of policy",90
NA,is imminent. Only today the Prime Minister has,90
NA,fuelled speculation of an election this year. There,90
NA,"is only one interpretation of that eventuality,",90
NA,that is that the Government is frightened of,90
NA,election next year which is the propertimethat,90
NA,such an election is due. The reason I am,90
NA,prompted to make that remark is that the rudeeper,90
NA,mours around the corridors-the y may even be,90
NA,fact by now and announced publicly-ar e that,90
NA,"two Ministers, perhaps the Minister for further",90
NA,Transport ( Mr Nixon) at the table is one of the,90
NA,"unfortunates, have been prevented from going",90
NA,on their overseas trips. The Minister shakes,90
NA,head. He is fortunate. He is still going on his,90
NA,jaunt some time soon.,90
NA,Mr Nixon- I do not happen to be proposing to,90
NA,leave this country at all.,90
Mr HURFORD, I shall allow the interjection,90
NA,"by the Minister for Transport and say that, temcutting",90
NA,"porarily, he is staying in the country. The next",90
NA,Premiers Conference in October has a fundacepted,90
NA,mental dispute to settle before the Commonon,90
NA,wealth can proceed with its plans in this area.,90
NA,Last year the States were expected to get an extra,90
NA,$90m under the tax sharing arrangements to balneed,90
NA,ance their cuts in specific purpose grants. As,90
NA,"events turned out, tax receipts",90
NA,extra $90m payment did not eventuate. All the,90
NA,States bar Queensland have been forced into theindependent,90
NA,position where the tax sharing formula was to,90
NA,give them less revenue than the guaranteed,90
NA,minumum determined by reference to the old early 1976.,90
NA,"grants formula. Needless to say,fiveof the States",90
NA,done away with this guarantee. As a result,90
NA,the tax sharing formula has been abandoned and,90
NA,cuts there is now a new dispute between the Com-,90
NA,monwealth and the States over the form the for-,90
NA,terms. Aborigi-mula should take.,90
NA,urban We on this side of the House have pointed out,90
NA,by to the Government manytimesthat its pohcies,90
NA,towards the States involve more confrontation,90
NA,than co-operation. The latest dispute over the,90
NA,reimbursement formula is but one in a long line,90
NA,"once of disputes. However, this could be the one",90
NA,"which brings the demise of the farce, which is",90
NA,what I call the so-called new federalism pohcy.,90
NA,Unless agreement is reached over a new formula,90
NA,18 perthe Government's version of federalism is,90
NA,"finished. Considering the problems it has caused,",90
NA,"a this would probably be the best result all round,",90
NA,"cent, namely, the end of this farce known as new",90
NA,At the outset of my speech I said that this Bill,90
NA,per was an intrinsic part of the Government's two,90
NA,main pohcy initiatives. I have already discussed,90
NA,the one relating to Federal-State relations-th e,90
NA,"new federalism. I turn now to the other, the cut-",90
NA,"ting of government expenditure. Last year, dur-",90
NA,"and ing debate on this Bill's predecessor, I pointed",90
NA,an out that the Government's policy of cutting pub-,90
NA,"hc expenditure, in particular capital works",90
NA,"expenditure, threatened to push the economy",90
NA,into recession. The Government has cer-,90
NA,a tainly not learned the lesson of the last 12,90
NA,"months, for we have been pushed further and",90
NA,into that recession. For the next financial,90
NA,year funds going to the States for capital works,90
NA,programs are down some 12 per cent in real,90
NA,his terms compared with those presentiy available.,90
NA,This followed substantial cuts in 1976-77. Total,90
NA,capital outlays in the recent Budget have fallen,90
NA,by almost 18 per cent in real terms.,90
NA,It is worth examining what has happened to,90
NA,the economy since the Government's policy of,90
NA,drastically pubhc expenditure has begun,90
NA,to have a substantial impact. It is generally ac-,90
NA,by independent observers-no t by people,90
NA,this side necessarily-tha t the levels of pubhc,90

Mr HURFORD,Independent experts such as,91
NA,"the Institute of Apphed Economics, even people",91
NA,such as professors at our various universities and,91
NA,most eminent economists in this country have,91
NA,agreed that the Hayden Budget represented a,91

NA,Mr Sainsbury-Oh !,91
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Lucock)-I,91
NA,suggest that the honourable member for Eden-,91
NA,Monaro keep his remarks to himself until he is,91
NA,called to make his speech.,91
Mr HURFORD,With the proper balance in,91
NA,"that Budget, the result was that until April 1976,",91
NA,before the policies of the Fraser Government,91
NA,"were beginning to apply, all the indicators",91
NA,showed improvement. The level of unemploy-,91
NA,ment reduced during those three months. Retail,91
NA,sales increased. Production figures increased. I,91
NA,am grateful for the honourable member's inter-,91
NA,jection inasmuch as it gives me another oppor-,91
NA,tunity to remind not only the ignorant back,91
NA,bench members of the Fraser Government but,91
NA,also the people of this country that as soon as,91
NA,pohcies of cutting pubhc spending and of res-,91
NA,tricting the money supply growth to ridiculously,91
NA,"low levels began to apply, so unemployment",91
NA,levels turned for the worse. Today the unemploy-,91
NA,ment level is unprecedently high. The economy is,91
NA,in grave stagnation and is in far worse shape,91
NA,than it was 21 months ago when this Govern-,91
NA,ment took over.,91
NA,It is becoming increasingly clear to the people,91
NA,of this country that the poor state of the econ-,91
NA,"omy, which was accepted to be the case in",91
NA,"December 1975, at the time of the election, was",91
NA,due not to policies ofthe Labor Government but,91
NA,to the world economic crisis which had over-,91
NA,taken all the developed and under-developed,91
NA,nations.,91
NA,MrSainsbury-Oh!,91
Mr HURFORD,That will be said again and,91
NA,again and is another reason why people such as,91
NA,the honourable member for Eden-Monaro will,91
NA,be oncers in Parhament. That realisation is be-,91
NA,coming clearer to the people of this nation. The,91
NA,"Budget, I repeat, was worlcing early in 1976.",91
NA,"However, thefirstLynch Budget, with, amongst",91
NA,"other things, its cuts in government capital outIt",91
NA,"lays, destroyed the groundwork for recovery",91
NA,built by the 1975-76 Budget.,91
NA,A comparison of a wide range of indicators,91
NA,reveals that the economy in the last six months of,91
NA,"1976-77, when the Fraser Government's pohcies",91
NA,"began to apply, was performing much worse",91
NA,than it had during the corresponding period of,91
NA,the previousfinancialyear when the Labor Party,91
NA,was in power. Let me go through these indicators,91
NA,for the record. Non-farm product grew by 3.5 per,91
NA,cent in thefirstsix months of 1976. It fell by 0.6,91
NA,per cent in the corresponding period of 1977.,91
NA,Personal consumption rose by one per cent in the,91
NA,March and June quarters of 1976. It fell by 1.8,91
NA,per cent in the same period of 1977. Private capi-,91
NA,tal investment increased by 12.6 per cent in tne,91
NA,"first half of 1976, compared with a decline of 9.3",91
NA,per cent in the six months to June 1977.1 do not,91
NA,"Uke repeatingfigureafterfigure,but it is necess-",91
NA,ary for thesefiguresto go into the record where,91
NA,they wtil be used to good effect. They wtil show,91
NA,the people of this countiy that my point is true.,91
NA,My point is that as soon as the Fraser Govern-,91
NA,ment's economic policies began to work the,91
NA,indicators turned for the worse.,91
NA,Investment in dwellings rose by 14.3 per cent,91
NA,"in the second half of 1975-76 and fell, after the",91
NA,"Fraser Government took over, by 10.8 per cent",91
NA,in the half year to June 1977. RetaU sales are,91
NA,stagnant in real terms. In the 12 months to July,91
NA,"the 1977 they rose by 11 per cent, compared with a",91
NA,rise in the goods component of the consumer,91
NA,price index of the same order. There was no,91
NA,growth in production during the last year. The,91
NA,Austrahan Bureau of Statistics indices of pro-,91
NA,duction for July this year reveal that 17 items had,91
NA,"fallen in production during the last year, while",91
NA,only 14 items had risen. The AustraUa and New,91
NA,Zealand Banking Group Ltd index of factory,91
NA,production in June was at the same level as it was,91
NA,12 months earlier. Unemployment as measured,91
NA,by the Australian Bureau of Statistics labour,91
NA,force survey had risen by 25 per cent in the six,91
NA,months to last May. The number of registered,91
NA,unemployed with the Commonwealth Em-,91
NA,"ployment Service was some 68,000 higher in",91
NA,August of this year than it was in July 1976.,91
NA,Overtime levels at the end of June were no,91
NA,higher than those of 12 months earlier. This,91
NA,slump in activity in early 1977 was emphasised,91
NA,by the recent down-turn readjustment of the,91
NA,forecasts by the Organisation for Economic Co-,91
NA,operation and Development of Australia's,91
NA,"growth rate for 1977, from 3.2 per cent to 2 per",91
NA,"cent. What a miserable, sorry record that is of the",91
NA,Fraser Government's policies.,91
NA,is quite obvious from these statistics that the,91
NA,"Government's economic policies, of which this",91
NA,"BUl is an integral part, have had a detrimental",91
NA,effect on the economy. There is no reason to,92
NA,assume that the further cuts in capital outlays,92
NA,nalled by this Bill cannot bring about a further indeed.,92
NA,"decline in activity. In fact, that is precisely what",92
NA,will happen. One of the rationale given by,92
NA,Government for its pohcy of cutting back on,92
NA,pubhc spending is that it is simply following,92
NA,pohcy endorsed by the OECD. This is not true.,92
NA,has never been true. It is true that many OECD,92
NA,countries have cut back the rate of growth of real,92
NA,"government outlays, but they have not, as this",92
NA,"Government has, cut the real level of",92
NA,expenditure.,92
NA,It is worth comparing the attitude of,92
NA,present AustraUan Government to pubUc capital,92
NA,expenditure with that of the major OECD counwould,92
NA,tries. This Government has been reducing any,92
NA,"government capital spending, of which State",92
NA,"capital spending is a significant pan, since its",92
NA,"Budget. By comparison, the OECD outlook for",92
NA,July shows that in real terms the growth in,92
NA,government capital spending in the second half,92
NA,"of 1977 wUl be 6 per cent in the United States,",92
NA,per cent in West Germany and 18 per cent in first,92
NA,Japan. It is generally recognised that government,92
NA,capital spending is an efficient and effective,92
NA,counter-cyclical tool. It can be increased,92
NA,unemployment is high and reduced when the,92
NA,economy begins to pick up.,92
NA,It is obvious that Australia's performance,92
NA,trying to solve the unemployment problem durinflationary,92
NA,ing the last two years does not compare favourthe,92
NA,ably with that of some overseas countries. Unemcutting,92
NA,ployment in Australia in August was a seasonally,92
NA,"adjusted 5.7 per cent of the work force, accorddue",92
NA,ing to the Austrahan Bureau of Statistics labour,92
NA,force survey released as late as today. This is,92
NA,increase of 30 per cent on the level of 18,92
NA,ago. Contrast this with a fall during the last,92
NA,"months of 3 per cent, one per cent and one",92
NA,cent in the total number of unemployed in,92
NA,"United States, Japan and West Germany respecsome",92
NA,tively. It is no coincidence that these three countransport-canno,92
NA,tries are following a pohcy of,92
NA,level of government capital expenditure.,92
Mr HODGMAN ,Thi s has nothing to do with,92
NA,BUl.,92
Mr HURFORD,Governmen t capital expenwithin,92
NA,diture is what this BUl is aU about. It is obvious,92
NA,that unless the present Government changes its,92
NA,"attitude to public sector capital spending,",92
NA,"especially that involving State programs,",92
NA,"100,000 young people who wUl join the work",92
NA,force at the end of this year wUl find very,92
NA,jobs to meet them. If the performance of the,92
NA,Government over the next six months is anything,92
NA,like that of the past six months those estimates of,92
NA,"sigunemployment of 430,000 wiU be conservative",92
NA,A Utde earlier today I quoted from an opinion,92
NA,"the of Professor Warren Hogan, who is one of the",92
NA,"Government's advisers, that the level of unem-",92
NA,"a ployment would not be 430,000 as I have just",92
NA,"It mentioned but 500,000, or 8 per cent of the work",92
NA,"force. As I mentioned earUer also, a cut in pubUc",92
NA,spending in general and a cut in the real level of,92
NA,funds to the States in particular has been the,92
NA,pubhc cornerstone of the Government's anti-,92
NA,inflationary pohcy. When the cost of this strategy,92
NA,the in terms of higher unemployment is measured,92
NA,many people would argue that the strategy,92
NA,have to be very successful indeed to have,92
NA,justification at all. The great tragedy is that,92
NA,the strategy has been singularly unsuccessful.,92
NA,first Consumer prices rose by more in 1976-77 than,92
NA,"they did a year earlier, and the Budget Papers",92
NA,tell us that there wUl be no improvement this,92
NA,"financial year. Indeed, recent developments have",92
NA,13 shown inflation to have been accelerating in the,92
NA,"half of 1977. For example, the impUcit defla-",92
NA,tor for non-farm product at annual rates rose,92
NA,from 8.9 per cent in the second half of 1976 to,92
NA,when 13.1 per cent in thefirsthalf of 1977.,92
NA,This Government's poUcies towards the States,92
NA,show attimesscant regard for the States' abihty,92
NA,in to raise their own charges and hence exacerbate,92
NA,"pressures. If this happens, any gains",92
NA,central Government may hope to make by,92
NA,"public spending, and hence aggregate de-",92
NA,"mand, wtil be immediately offset by price rises",92
NA,to increased State charges. In many instances,92
NA,the States have been forced either to cut services,92
NA,an or to increase charges. We mentioned this in the,92
NA,months amendment which I have had the honour to,92
NA,12 move tonight and which wtil be seconded shortly,92
NA,"per by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the",92
NA,the honourable member for Reid ( Mr Uren). In,92
NA,"cases where services-fo r example,",92
NA,"t reasonably be cut, price rises",92
NA,increasing the real are mandatory.,92
NA,The recent Victorian Budget contains,92
NA,examples of the results of this Federal Govern-,92
NA,the ment's austerity. Last March the Victorian,92
NA,Government approved budgets for hospitals,92
NA,the State. In its Budget of 7 September the,92
NA,Victorian Government was forced to cut these,92
NA,already approved plans by 5 per cent. The Prem-,92
NA,"ier, Mr Hamer, placed responsibiUty for this",92
NA,the action squarely at the feet of the Federal,92
NA,"Government, his own political colleagues. The",92
NA,few Melbourne Age has reported him as saying that,92
NA,the Federal Government had unilaterally cut its,92
NA,share of the costs of community health centres,92
NA,and the school dental program and that the State,93
NA,had without warning been forced to carry a,93
NA,greater share of the burden than it had pregovernment,93
NA,viously. It is worth noting in passing that such,93
NA,unilateral acdon is hardly the hallmark of a,93
NA,government that is interested in real corowing,93
NA,operation between alltiersof government. Of is,93
NA,"course, that is only the window dressing-th e",93
NA,words. When it comes to actions that is not,93
NA,example of real co-operation between the central,93
NA,Government and the States.,93
NA,It now appears that all Victorian hospitals,93
NA,be forced to impose staff ceilings and to place,93
NA,ban on new beds and services. It is to be hoped,93
NA,that the inefficiencies that staff ceilings have,93
NA,caused in the Commonwealth Public Service will,93
NA,not emerge in Victorian hospitals. The conseBill,93
NA,quences there could be far more,93
NA,that over the last two days we have seen the,93
NA,results of staff ceilings outlined in the,93
NA,"General's report, which indicates that ridiculous",93
NA,staff ceilings have led to terrible inefficiencies in,93
NA,Austrahan Government programs and in the,93
NA,administration of the Australian Government.,93
NA,"This could be repeated, and probably will",93
NA,"repeated, by this Government forcing the States",93
NA,to penny-pinch here and there. In some cases States.,93
NA,that will be apphed to hospitals,93
NA,"As well as announcing a curtailment of services,",93
NA,Victoria's recent Budget foreshadowed stiff costs.,93
NA,"increases in rail, tram and bus fares. These will",93
NA,inevitably cause a rise in general price levels.,93

Mr HURFORD,I t is probable that other,93
NA,State budgets will follow the same pattern as,93
NA,Victoria's with cuts in services and rises,93
NA,charges. It would be unrealistic to assume that,93

NA,programs ofthe States are toriseby,93

NA,ties. This compares with a 6 per cent real drop,93

NA,State Loan Council programs are effectively,93
NA,"underwritten by the Commonwealth, being part",93
NA,"of its Budget. State, semi-government and local",93
NA,"authorities, of course, have to pay",93
NA,higher interest rates on their funds. This means,93
NA,that the larger the proportion of total State bor-,93
NA,down through the authorities the greater,93
NA,the cost to the State as a whole. By forcing the,93
NA,States to do more of their borrowing outside the,93
NA,"an Loan Council program, this Bill increases the",93
NA,States' borrowing costs. The Federal deficit,93
NA,"looks better, but the States have to pay the price.",93
NA,"will Unfortunately, my time is almost at an end. I",93
NA,a should hke to summarise my points. This cut in,93
NA,pubhc spending will cause enormous problems,93

NA,If these funds and the funds raised for Loan,94

NA,The result has been a marked increase in the,94
NA,"do States' responsibihty, with no increase in capital",94

NA,receive only 37.4 per cent of the total Budget out-,94
NA,"lay for 1977-78. In the last Labor Budget, that of",94
NA,"1975-76, the States received 38.7 per cent of the",94
NA,total Budget outlay. That means that their share,94
NA,has fallen by about 1.25 percentage points over a,94
NA,period of two years. That is a significant decrease,94
NA,and one which puts the new federalism into its,94
NA,proper perspective. The States and local authori-,94
NA,ties are receiving substantially less under the,94
NA,present Government than they did under the,94
NA,"Labor Government. On the other hand, the",94
NA,share has increased. That has,94
NA,is been the end result of Fraser's new federalism.,94

NA,looking at the long term consequences. The Loan,94
NA,"4,919.3 5,604.4 Council allocation to the State governments is",94

NA,represents a decline in real terms of between 6,94

NA,(5.6) (11.6) into consideration that the inflation rate this year,94
NA,9.5 9.2 is 11 per cent to 12 per cent.,94
NA,This cutback in funds for building and con-,95
NA,strucuon comes at a dme when the,95

NA,18 months the labour force of the building and,95
NA,construcuon industry has dropped by 4 per cent.,95
NA,In the same period the total labour force has,95
NA,increased by some 2 per cent. There are signs of,95
NA,"modest recovery in the private sector, but that",95
NA,will be absorbed by the drop in spending conof,95
NA,trolled by the Commonwealth. This will push,95
NA,industry into deeper recession. More people in,95
NA,"the industry wul lose their jobs, and unemployrepayments",95
NA,ment will increase. Such a decline in the capacity,95
NA,of the industry must limit the chances for,95
NA,dium term recovery. Unless it is countered there,95
NA,will be serious botdenecks and cost pressures,95
NA,which will impair prospects for sustained,95

Mr UREN,"I thank the House. Furthermore,",95
NA,the cost of raising these funds has increased. This,95

Mr UREN,I thank the House. The interest,96
NA,rate on borrowings under the gentlemen's agreeinterest,96
NA,ment is approximately 11 per cent. By comparithan,96
NA,"son, capital funds provided through the Budget",96
NA,have a large grant component. That means that,96
NA,the effective interest rate on capital funds is,96
NA,"more than 7 per cent, and that is about the averto",96
NA,"age situation. In plain terms, the Government is",96
NA,coercing the States out of a lower interest,96
NA,sphere into a higher interest rate sphere. Becausemcreased,96
NA,"of that shift in the source offunds, the States",96
NA,a substantial increase in interest payments,96
NA,year and in the years ahead. Those payments,96
NA,be about $20m more in 1977-78 than they wouldforcing,96
NA,have been if the money had been allocated,96
NA,was in the last Labor Budget. Tbis is another,96
NA,effect on the States of Fraser's new federaUsm.,96
NA,has forced the States to move into a higher,96
NA,interest bracket in that they have to meet their,96
NA,program commitments other than by Budget alauthorities.,96
NA,"locations. This, of course, is another gimmick,",96
NA,"may use that term, under Fraser's new federalfor",96
NA,ism. It means that the States have to meet subI,96
NA,stantially increased interest payments. That,96
NA,money has to be raised by means of mcreased at,96
NA,taxes and charges for services. I might,96
NA,that is a further burden on the ordinary people.,96
NA,In turn it can have the effect only of increasing,96
NA,inflation and of imposing further burdens,96
NA,people who depend on the services provided,96
NA,State and local governments.,96
NA,The sewerage program which the Government,96
NA,scrapped is a prime example of that. Let us have,96
NA,a look at that situation. When we inherited the,96
NA,sewerage program in 1972 we found that 50 per,96
NA,cent of the people in Perth Uved in unsewered ney.,96
NA,homes; and one in every seven people in both,96
NA,Sydney and Melbourne Uved in unsewered man,96
NA,homes. In an effort to overcome the backlog,96
NA,"providing sewerage to these homes, we entered",96
NA,into an agreement under which we tried to carry,96
NA,out that program. It was a program which would,96
NA,cost an enormous amount of money. In the three,96
NA,years that we were in government we made doUar.,96
NA,avaUable something Uke $200m to try to catch,96
NA,up on the sewerage backlog. In the last year,96
NA,the Labor Government alone we made avaUable Phillip,96
NA,$ 113m. What were the terms on which we made,96
NA,"that money avaUable? Of that money, 30 per cent",96
NA,was made avaUable as an interest free nonat,96
NA,repayable grant and the other 70 per cent was,96
NA,made avaUable at the long term bond,96
NA,repayable over a period of about 40 years.,96
NA,What is the situation now? The situation is,96
NA,the State governments and the semi-government,96
NA,authorities wUl have to go on to the loan market,96
NA,and wUl have to pay increased interest rates.,96
NA,Semi-government authorities have to pay an,96
NA,rate 0.5 per cent to 0.75 per cent higher,96
NA,the long term Commonwealth bond rate.,96
NA,The best repayment terms they can get are 15 to,96
NA,20 years and in some cases shorter term. What,96
NA,no does that mean? It means that the taxpayers have,96
NA,pay higher water rates. The increased costs,96
NA,pass not only to the individual but also to busi-,96
NA,"rate ness. Business, hi turn, passes them on in",96
NA,prices again creating further inflation.,96
NA,faceThis Government by its new gimmickry of forc-,96
NA,this ing semi-government authorities and State,96
NA,will governments outside the Budget parameters is,96
NA,up interest rates at atimewhen it says,96
NA,as it that it wants to reduce interest rates.,96
NA,It Let us examine the debt burden of the sewer-,96
NA,age authorities. In 1972 an enormous debt bur-,96
NA,den was being carried by the semi-government,96
NA,"In Sydney the Metropolitan Water,",96
NA,ifi Sewerage and Drainage Board was paying 52c,96
NA,"every dollar it coUected. Mr Deputy Speaker,",96
NA,"think it would be fair, when the Minister for",96
NA,Special Trade Negotiations ( Mr Howard) talks,96
NA,"the table for about 15 minutes of my speech, if",96
NA,say that something were said from the Chair.,96
Mr HOWARD ,"What is the matter, Tom? Can",96
NA,on you not hang on to your audience?,96
Mr UREN,Th e Mmister Uves in a very ex-,96
NA,clusive suburb. He Uves in an affluent area. He is,96
NA,a wealthy young man. He thinks only of wealth.,96
NA,He does not think of anybody. He does not think,96
NA,about the under-privileged people in the west-,96
NA,"ern, southern or south-western suburbs of Syd-",96
NA,He really represents the privileged class. It is,96
NA,that class which Fraserism breeds. He is a young,96
NA,who thinks he is going places. This is part of,96
NA,"in Fraser's new federalism. As I was saying, the",96
NA,debt burden on the metropolitan sewerage,96
NA,authorities in Sydney in 1972 was 52c for every,96
NA,dollar they collected. In Newcastle it was 53c in,96
NA,every dollar. In Perth it was about 53c in every,96
NA,In Melbourne it was 58c in every dollar.,96
NA,Yet in Melbourne the whole catchment area is in,96
NA,of such a situation that it has been poUuting Port,96
NA,Bay for many years. This is the great sad-,96
NA,ness about the sewerage backlog. If this sewer-,96
NA,age backlog is to be cleared now it wUl be done,96
NA,a much higher cost to the people. It wtil be,96
NA,inflationary and a burden on the great majority,96
NA,rate and of the AustraUan people.,96
NA,It is extremely ironic that the Government has,96
NA,thatmade a commitment to cutting the deficit to con-,96
NA,trol inflation. It has done this in a cosmetic way,96
NA,by changing the capital funding arrangements,96
NA,and increasing interest payments. These,96
NA,increased payments have to be passed on and the,97
NA,inflation rate therefore increases.,97
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Lucock)- tect the,97
NA,Order! If the Minister for Special Trade detriment.,97
NA,Negotiations wants to carry on a conversation changing,97
NA,with the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr done in arelativities,97
NA,Connolly) he should at least shift to the front taken no account,97
NA,bench. The voices carry across to the microphone,97
NA,and it is not fair to the main spokesman for the,97
NA,Opposition.,97
Mr HOWARD ,I apologise to the Chair and,97
NA,the honourable member for Reid.,97
Mr UREN,If we look more closely at thehave,97
NA,relative share of capital funds in each State we,97
NA,find other disturbing trends. Since the Labor,97
NA,"Budget of 1975-76, specific purpose capital pay-",97
NA,ments have fallen by 33.5 per cent in real terms.,97
NA,Loan Council payments have fallen by 11.5 per,97
NA,cent. Funds under the gentlemen's agreement,97
NA,have increased by 20.5 per cent. Some States are,97
NA,more dependent upon a particular source ofexpired.,97
NA,"capital funds than are others. As a consequence,",97
NA,the relative share of total capital funds,97
NA,"the States has changed. For example, the less",97
NA,wealthy States of South Austraha and Tasmania,97
NA,depend more on Loan Council funds than onreserve,97
NA,gentlemen's agreement funds. I have set out amendment,97
NA,table which shows how the smaller States have,97
NA,been disadvantaged. I seek leave to have it incor-,97
NA,porated in Hansard.,97
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,I s leave granted? written,97

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Lucock)-,97
NA,Order! The honourable member's time has,97
Mr SAINSBURY ,Eden-Monaro) (9.37)- I,97
NA,think it was extremely bad form for the Deputy,97
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Uren) not to,97
NA,his right to speak as the seconder of the,97
NA,a as most people in this House with,97
NA,reasonable principles would do. It would prob-,97
NA,ably have been of great benefit to the people of,97
NA,AustraUa who are listening if he had just,97
NA,seconded the amendment and incorporated his,97
NA,"speech in Hansard. Nevertheless, I must",97
NA,retaliate on one or two things of a general nature,97
NA,that have been mentioned by the two previous,97
NA,speakers. Even though they refused to speak on,97
NA,Table 4,97
NA,"this Bill which, as somebody said, is a machinery",97
NA,BUl they have been engaging in the normal,97
NA,STATES Labor Party diatribe of half-truths. The honour-,97
NA,able member for Adelaide ( Mr Hurford) actu-,97
NA,ally said that the economy is in worse shape than,97
NA,1975-76 1977-78 when the Labor Party went out of office. If he,97
NA,cares to look at some of thefigures-not half-,97
NA,"32.88 33.49 truths-suc h as gross domestic product, inflation",97
NA,26.32 26.47,97
NA,"16.36 16.10 rates, company profits and real disposable",97
NA,10.31 9.92 incomes in this country since Labor went out of,97
NA,8.99 9.15 office he will see that even though the struggle is,97
NA,5.06 4.87 very difficult it is being won. It is being made,97
NA,100.0 100.0 increasingly difficult by the bitter people on the,97
NA,other side ofthe House.,97
NA,One or two of the things which the Deputy,97
NA,Leader of the Opposition said tonight sounded,97
NA,rather sick to me. I fear that some of the bitter-,97
NA,Larger ness which seems to pervade the Opposition,97
NA,benches is getting them away from the true prob-,97
NA,lems of Austraha. The honourable member,97
NA,talked about unemployment as though the Op-,97
NA,ever cared about unemployment. It is aU,97
NA,very well for him to come into this House at,98
NA,stage and talk about great unemployment in this,98
NA,country. We know we have great unemployment,98
NA,in this country. We know it is a tremendous,98
NA,lem wbich all AustraUans must face. But what,98
NA,[ >osidve means has the Opposition put up in,98
NA,ast 18 months to overcome this problem. I could,98
NA,certainly mention a few negative means. It,98
NA,derided the Government when it asked the Conreal,98
NA,cUiation and Arbitation Commission to keep has,98
NA,down wage increases. Opposition members who,98
NA,do not relate to the working man in this country,98
NA,anymore should talk to some of the working,98
NA,people. The honourable member for Burke ( Mr,98
NA,Keith Johnson) is laughing. He takes pride in the slighdy,98
NA,fact that he used to be a truck driver. There are,98
NA,plenty of truck drivers in my electorate and increase,98
NA,plenty of truck drivers all over AustraUa. They increase,98
NA,are working men. They are people who worry spend,98
NA,about how much their wives and children are grams in,98
NA,going to have. The man who is laughing does not probably speak,98
NA,really care about them.,98
NA,The last two honourable members who spoke,98
NA,"in this debate apparently think , that aU this",98
NA,tremendous increase in pubhc expenditure about,98
NA,"which they speak so regularly m this place,",98
NA,going to fall out ofthe sky. Who wtil pay for,98
NA,extra pubUc expenditure? Will it be the Governfunds;,98
NA,"ment that wtil pay? No, it wtil not be the",98
NA,ment; it wtil be the taxpayer. The taxpayer wtil,98
NA,have to pay and he wtil have much less money to funds,98
NA,spend if he has to pay higher taxes. The Lord ment tofind,98
NA,knows that there are enough people on the other per,98
NA,"side who have said recently that we must raise Roads Act, and in such",98
NA,taxes so that we can cover some of this,98
NA,pubUc expenditure. The honourable member for Queensland Government project'. I do'Another,98
NA,"Adelaide, who I beUeve is some sort of economic why he has to do that. I do not know why",98
NA,"spokesman for the other side, often says that",98
NA,must raise taxes. The sorts of things that we on,98
NA,this side of the House are doing are designed to. Wales,98
NA,bring taxes down. The evidence of that isrightin,98
NA,the Budget this year and on 1 February next yearing,98
NA,the people of AustraUa wtil recognise this when we,98
NA,they receive their pay packets.,98
NA,Let me return to this machinery Bill which,98
NA,"repeat, in its basic terms, of BUls that have",98
NA,through since 1970 when a Government ofthe,98
NA,same colour as the present Government decided,98
NA,that it would assist the States to some extent,98
NA,putting through what normaUy would have beenjust,98
NA,loan funds without interest payments from the,98
NA,States. That was a reasonably generous sort of,98
NA,offer and in terms ofthe amount of money being,98
NA,offered in this BUl-$477m-it wtil save the rural,98
NA,"States, even at present interest rates of 10",98
NA,"cent or more, around $50m per annum. That has",98
NA,been going on since 1970 and it is the sort,98
NA,this thing that one would expect from a Government,98
NA,or our colour. Half truths have been coming out,98
NA,of the mouths of the two previous speakers who,98
NA,probhave been talking about no increase in funding,98
NA,to the States this year. They seem to be following,98
NA,the the myth that the New South Wales Premier has,98
NA,been putting around in the newspapers recently.,98
NA,Fancy saying that there has been no increase in,98
NA,funds to the States this year! AU anybody,98
NA,to do is to look at the figures. It is quite easy.,98
NA,We are talking about a total this year of some,98
NA,"$5,775m in total funds to the States, and that",98
NA,includes loan funds which admittedly have been,98
NA,"funds,",98
NA,trimmed. It also includes general revenue,98
NA,and that is a substantial increase. It is an,98
NA,of 13.8 per cent on last year. That,98
NA,is greater than the rate of mflation. It,98
NA,means that the State governments have more to,98
NA,real terms on some of their own pro-,98
NA,than they had last year. Some people will,98
NA,after me about the Govern-,98
NA,ment's federalism pohcy and ask whether some,98
NA,of the things that we do for the States are worth-,98
NA,"while, because all we seem to get from some of",98
NA,the Premiers is criticism in face of the fact that,98
NA,is they are receiving more funds from the Federal,98
NA,the Government. I repeat that they are not our,98
NA,they are taxpayers funds. We have to raise,98
NA,Governthem from somebody out ofhis pay packet.,98
NA,It is most disturbing to read that some of the,98
NA,their way from the Federal Govern-,98
NA,"centthefundingStates, for projects where there is 100",98
NA,as under the National,98
NA,Queensland the Premier puts,98
NA,increased up signs along the road saying,98
NA,not know,98
NA,he has,98
NA,we to waste money on any signs. The New South,98
NA,rural,98
NA,Government receives money from us for,98
NA,local roads but it wants to reduce its match-,98
NA,funds so that the overall rural local roads,98
NA,funding this year may not mcrease by as much as,98
NA,would hope. We had the same battle last year,98
NA,and it looks as though it is on again this year. I,98
NA,is a just wonder what the New South Wales Govern-,98
NA,gone ment thinks about federal funding. I wonder,98
NA,what the New South Wales Government thinks,98
NA,about funding in general especiaUy in country,98
NA,by areas when examples such as that which I have,98
NA,mentioned keep coming up. I have been get-,98
NA,ting sUghtly off the track. Talking about roads,98
NA,"and federal funding to the States, the New South",98
NA,Wales Government took a long time to put in its,98
NA,local roads aUocation priorities this year.,98
NA,per Why did it take that Government 6 weeks longer,98
NA,on the allocations than it took for urban local,98
NA,"of roads, the beloved urban local roads on which",98
NA,the New South Wales Labor Government places,99
NA,such high priority? The rural local roads obvi-,99
NA,ously do not matter very much.,99
NA,. In educauon we find that these large block,99
NA,funds that we are talking about tonight have,99
NA,"been increased in general, but who gets knocked",99
NA,on the head over education funding when we,99
NA,reduce a certain amount of money for govern-,99
NA,ment schools this year? We do. We have,99
NA,"reduced, by the guidelines to the Schools Com-",99
NA,"mission, some $14m out of a total of $571m to",99
NA,government schools this year in order to assist,99
NA,"non-government schools, which after all save the",99
NA,State government a great deal by their very,99
NA,existence.,99
NA,Mr Abel-An d the taxpayer.,99
Mr SAINSBURY,"An d the taxpayer, as the",99
NA,honourable member for Evans says. They save,99
NA,the taxpayer a certain amount of money but be-,99
NA,cause we have decided that non-government,99
NA,schools will receive a small amount less we come,99
NA,in for all the cross-fire. People forget that in this,99
NA,Bill we are debating tonight and in our general,99
NA,pohcy the States are receiving from us an increas-,99
NA,ing amount of money in real terms. One wonders,99
NA,whether it is worth the effort. One wonders,99
NA,whether we should not give the States a greatly,99
NA,increased amount and say. 'We will get out of,99
NA,education. We will get out of roads.' I just wish,99
NA,that the State governments in their criticism,99
NA,would be a little more fair. I turn now to pre-,99
NA,"schools, another area that has been mentioned a",99
NA,lot lately. We have not increased our funding for,99
NA,pre-schools this year but we received criticism,99
NA,and it is alleged that in New South Wales we,99
NA,have reduced funds for pre-schools.,99
Mr LES MCMAHON ,Yo u have.,99
Mr SAINSBURY,Tha t is certainly a he. It is,99
NA,an absolute lie. We have not reduced any funds,99
NA,for pre-schools. Why do the State governments,99
NA,not get stuck into the education system and look,99
NA,"after the pre-school children, as they were bound",99
NA,to do for many years previously? Why are we,99
NA,criticised? We are increasing our overall funds to,99
NA,the States by a large amount in relative terms,99
NA,and we are still coming in for criticism.,99
NA,I conclude now because a number of other,99
NA,"people want to speak, and that has been made",99
NA,"difficult enough by the previous speaker, the",99
NA,honourable member for Reid. I would just like to,99
NA,reiterate to the people of Austraha that this Bill,99
NA,confirms the fact even more that the present,99
NA,Government is one of decentralism. We want the,99
NA,people to keep as much money as possible. We,99
NA,want the States to have as much money as poss-,99
NA,ible. That is why we brought in the tax changes in,99
NA,the Budget. But the money that we have to,99
NA,raise-w e do not want to have to raise more,99
NA,"money than we need, and that is our policy-",99
NA,should be spent as close to the people as possible.,99
NA,That is why we are helping the States as much as,99
NA,possible in the face of unjustifiable criticism that,99
NA,we seem to be receiving from those States.,99
Mr WENTWORTH ,Mackellar ),99
NA,(9.48)-Very rightly we give to the States free-,99
NA,dom to decide how they spend the money they,99
NA,receive from the Commonwealth Government.,99
NA,But that does not mean that we should have no,99
NA,"concern where national interests are involved,",99
NA,From the past one can look at some ofthe ways,99
NA,in which these national interests have been,99
NA,treated. I think particularly of one matter that,99
NA,"concerns the New South Wales Government,",99
NA,"that is, its decision to abandon the central motor-",99
NA,way systems of Sydney and to sell the land which,99
NA,has been purchased with the help of past Com-,99
NA,monwealth funds. The Australian Labor Party,99
NA,plan is to dice the motorways and bring per-,99
NA,manent strangulation to Sydney's city traffic. The,99
NA,New South Wales Government is going to stop,99
NA,the western motorway from the centre of Sydney,99
NA,to Concord; stop the southern motorway from,99
NA,"the centre of Sydney to Alexandria, stop the",99
NA,north-west motorway at some dead end in Glebe,99
NA,"and, as for the Warringah expressway, abandon",99
NA,"it at Willoughby. This will mean, for example,",99
NA,permanent strangulation for the new port at Bot-,99
NA,any and for the airport traffic. The sale of the,99
NA,"land is an act of vandalism, and the decision to",99
NA,re-zone is simply one of the decisions that is,99
NA,meant to hit motorists throughout Sydney. The,99
NA,Labor Party has the old-fashioned idea that no-,99
NA,body owns a motorcar unless he is a silver tail.,99
NA,Most people who own motorcars are not silver,99
NA,tails .at all. Most people are now fortunate,99
NA,enough to own a motorcar.,99
NA,I say these things because they relate particu-,99
NA,larly to the local government elections which are,99
NA,to be held in Sydney on Saturday. Some Labor,99
NA,candidates are standing for office at those elec-,99
NA,tions. Those Labor candidates are bound by,99
NA,party decisions even though they may maintain,99
NA,the contrary. They may sincerely think that they,99
NA,can talk in favour of the traffic plans for Sydney.,99
NA,"However, they are bound by the Labor decision",99
NA,to destroy permanently the Sydney city traffic,99
NA,and bring permanent strangulation to the city of,99
NA,Sydney. Every Labor Party candidate at the local,99
NA,government elections on Saturday is bound to,99
NA,support this plan. He may say otherwise in his,99
NA,election speech or he may think otherwise but he,99
NA,will very soon find he is not aUowed to think,99
NA,otherwise. Whether he means what he says or,99
NA,"not, every one of them will be a fifth column",100
NA,didate for his own area.,100
NA,I am thinking particularly of the elections for strangulation,100
NA,the city of Sydney. It would be tragic if that,100
NA,cil were to fall under the control of Labor,100
NA,men who are endeavouring to strangle city,100
NA,traffic. I speak also of the elections for the Manly- Labor,100
NA,Warringah area which is my own area. I know,100
NA,that there will be Labor candidates in the,100
NA,tion for this area which is to be held on Saturday.,100
NA,I ask that every one of those Labor candidates,100
NA,should be placed last-,100
NA,Mr Keith Johnson- I rise to order. I thought,100
NA,that we were debating the States Grants (Capital,100
NA,Assistance) Bill and not some municipal,100
NA,"paign committee meeting. I ask you, Mr Deputy",100
NA,"Speaker, to bring the honourable member to",100
NA,order and ask him to speak to the Bill before the,100
NA,House.,100
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Lucock)-I,100
NA,accept the fact that the Bill we are discussing,100
NA,concerned with assistance so far as roads and,100
NA,other matters are concerned. But I would suggest,100
NA,to the honourable member for Mackellar that,100
NA,should not devote the whole of his speech to,100
NA,election which is not the concern of this House,100
NA,nor of the Bill before the House.,100
Mr WENTWORTH,"No , sir. But it is of conin",100
NA,cern to this House in that this House has an,100
NA,interest in seeing that Sydney city traffic is,100
NA,permanently strangled. That is a matter of,100
NA,national concern. It is the proper concern of this,100
NA,House.,100
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! I would,100
NA,remind the honourable member that the subject,100
NA,matter of local government elections is not,100
NA,concern of this House so far as this legislation,100
NA,concerned. I again suggest that the honourable,100
NA,member should not continue to place his emphahave,100
NA,sis upon local government elections or upon,100
NA,value or otherwise of candidates standing for,100
NA,those elections or their policies.,100
Mr WENTWORTH," Mr Deputy Speaker, I ' House",100
NA,am referring to the decision of the State Labor,100
NA,Government to use moneys which have been going,100
NA,provided under this legislation to,100
NA,The State Government has now decided to sell,100
NA,that land. I regard this as an abuse of the moneys also,100
NA,that have been provided by this Parhament. I,100
NA,regard this as completely germane to the legispayers,100
NA,lation that is before us at the moment.,100
NA,I do not want to put too much emphasis on,100
NA,local government elections. But I do say that,100
NA,Labor candidates are concerned with the conus,100
NA,tinuance and the further perpetration of this,100
NA,cancrime against Sydney. In my area in particular,100
NA,every Labor candidate is dedicated to the,100
NA,of traffic between Manly-,100
NA,counheWaningah and the city. Every car owner when,100
NA,alderremembercasts his vote on Saturday might well,100
NA,that and vote solidly against the,100
NA,candidates.,100
Mr KEITH JOHNSON ,Burke) (9.55)- I,100
NA,elecsupport the amendment moved by the honour-,100
NA,able member for Adelaide ( Mr Hurford). I wtil,100
NA,try to be relevant to the Bill before the House.,100
NA,"Indeed, no local government elections will be",100
NA,held in Victoria next Saturday. The honourable,100
NA,member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) talked,100
NA,about the strangulation of Sydney by cars or,100
NA,camsomething. He seemed to think that here was,100
NA,some virtue in everyone owning his own motor,100
NA,car. I sincerely hope that motorcar owners do not,100
NA,choose precisely the same time to take their cars,100
NA,onto the roads.,100
NA,The honourable member for Eden-Monaro,100
NA,is ( Mr Sainsbury) who spoke to this Bill seemed to,100
NA,"think that it is some sort of a crime, that some-",100
NA,how or other it is immoral or amoral or whatever,100
NA,he for governments to raise taxation. The honour-,100
NA,an able gentleman who has been in this place for a,100
NA,short time-an d after reading what was said by,100
NA,Malcolm Mackerras he will be here for less time,100
NA,the future than he has been in the past-ha s,100
NA,not yet learned what the art of government is all,100
NA,not about. I think the honourable member used the,100
NA,words: 'We want people to keep as much money,100
NA,as possible'. I think he meant to say 'as much of,100
NA,their money as possible'. If we follow that argu-,100
NA,ment through I guess we are right back to the,100
NA,time when we did not have government and,100
NA,were in an anarchical situation in which only,100
NA,the those who had strength had power. Even with,100
NA,is the intervention of government in this country,100
NA,that proposition is very much true. Those who,100
NA,money and strength have the power and,100
NA,the those who have neither of these things are,100
NA,obliged to do the bidding of those who do. What,100
NA,the honourable member is trying to tell the,100
NA,is that there is some sort of virtue in this,100
NA,Government saying to people: 'Look we are not,100
NA,to tax you; we will almost leave you with-,100
NA,purchase land. out any taxation at all'.,100
NA,The honourable member for Eden-Monaro,100
NA,made the point that in the end the user pays.,100
NA,He did not use those words. He said that the tax-,100
NA,"pay, that governments have not funds.",100
NA,That is true. Everyone knows that. There are no,100
NA,the simpletons in Australia. We do not need the,100
NA,honourable member for Eden-Monaro to treat,100
NA,as if we were a bunch of simpletons. We all,100
NA,know that governments do not own money trees.,100
NA,We know that money does not grow in the courtof,101
NA,yards of this Parliament House. We all know this,101
NA,"because we all are taxpayers, and those who sit",101
NA,in this chamber are fairly heavy taxpayers. The,101
NA,incomes earned by the people who Uve in my what,101
NA,electorate are not as substantial as my own. But,101
NA,they pay taxes and they know who is paying for,101
NA,things. But what they understand more than does,101
NA,the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is that sees fit.,101
NA,those who earn the most ought to pay the most.,101
NA,"They know that, I know that and those honourThere",101
NA,"able members on the other side of the House,",101
NA,"they were quite sincere, if they were to stand",101
NA,front of their shaving ntirror tomorrow and,101
NA,"not ashamed to look themselves in the face,",101
NA,would agree with what I am saying. There is no,101
NA,other way in which to raise revenue. We aU know,101
NA,that.,101
NA,We all know that no private citizen in,101
NA,Australia wtil ever buUd a teaching hospital such,101
NA,as the Royal Melbourne Hospital. We know that,101
NA,doctors wtil build their private hospitals,101
NA,they will treat selected patients and the Uke.,101
NA,all know that the hospital that wtil reaUy provide,101
NA,a service to the community wtil not be built by,101
NA,individual because it is too expensive to do so.,101
NA,is too costly and it is not profitable. Under the,101
NA,private enterprise system in which those who sit,101
NA,"opposite to ourtilustriousparty beUeve, only",101
NA,those things that are profitable are owned by,101
NA,"individuals, companies and the Uke. Private",101
NA,enterprise does not own anything that is not,101
NA,fitable. Ittikesto hive off these undertakings to,101
NA,"government to run. But then it says: 'Look,",101
NA,government cannot run these things. It does not,101
NA,run them profitably. Therefore private,101
NA,must be better than government enterprise be-,101
NA,cause our enterprises are profitable and the,101
NA,Government's enterprises are not'. That is the of,101
NA,sort of argument they are trying to put to the Government.,101
NA,people of Australia. Let me get back to this quesUnder,101
NA,"tion of States grants. The Minister for Europe or Bill,",101
NA,Asia or North Africa or somewhere-,101
Mr HOWARD ,Th e member for Bennelong.,101
Mr KEITH JOHNSON,"Yes, the honourvalue ofmillion",101
NA,able member for Bennelong. What are we really,101
NA,talking about? I wtil teU the Minister. The Bill,101
NA,fore us tonight says that-,101
NA,Mr Martyr-Ada m Smith.,101
Mr KEITH JOHNSON,If the honourable through,101
NA,member for Swan is going to talk about his menment,101
NA,"tor, I am not interested. The BiU states:",101
NA,There is payable to a State specified in Column,101
NA,"Schedule, during the year ending on 30 June 1978, for",101
NA,purpose of financial assistance in connexion with expendi-,101
NA,"ture of a capital nature, the amount specified in",101
NA,"the Schedule opposite to the name of that State,",101
NA,any amounts paid to that State under section 4 of the,101
NA,States Grants (Capital Assistance) Act (No. 2) 1976.,101
NA,Further on it says that the States may spend this,101
NA,. money as they seefit.That is fair enough. That is,101
NA,the Bill is aU about. The total sum involved,101
NA,"under this Bill is $477,933,000. My State of Vic-",101
NA,"toria is to receive the sum of $120,071,000. That",101
NA,is to go to the State and is to be used as the State,101
NA,is in Victoria at the moment quite a,101
NA,if controversy about three areas of land which are,101
NA,in being examined by a royal commission. They,101
NA,were were purchased with funds which were made,101
NA,available to the Liberal Government in Victoria,101
NA,by the Government in Canberra on the basis that,101
NA,they could be used for whatever purposes the,101
NA,State Government sawfitto use them. I wiU tell,101
NA,the House the purpose for which that Govern-,101
NA,ment sawfitto use them. It thought that the fob,101
NA,pockets of real estate developers was afitplace,101
NA,m which to deposit that money. The honourable,101
NA,where member for Eden-Monaro ( Mr Sainsbury) told,101
NA,We us that people should be able to decide how they,101
NA,are to spend their money. I might have been per-,101
NA,"an suaded to agree with him, except for the fact that",101
NA,It this money was plundered out of this place by a,101
NA,"corrupt, inept government in Victoria, a Liberal",101
NA,"Government, and then stuffed into the pockets of",101
NA,land developers. The honourable member for,101
NA,Eden-Monaro mentioned a truck driver. I am the,101
NA,"truck driver he mentioned, and I am not",101
NA,proashamed of it. I would have been the best truck,101
NA,driver in Victoria. I drove trucks for 20 years and,101
NA,never had a conviction. Perhaps I was the,101
NA,luckiest truck driver in Victoria. I have before me,101
NA,enterprise an article which states:,101
NA,Land owners in the Geelong region stand to make millions,101
NA,dollars under legislation introduced by the State,101
NA,"the legisladon, the Geelong Regional Commission",101
NA,the profits from any rezoning of land for development,101
NA,by the commission must be paid to existing land owners.,101
NA,Land owners whose land the commission wants to buy,101
NA,would receive profits of several thousand dollars an acre-o r,101
NA,"several dollars per 1,000 acres-o n top of the existing",101
NA,their land.,101
NA,beThat is what is happening to the money that is,101
NA,being sent to the Government of Victoria by the,101
NA,Government in Canberra-mone y taken from,101
NA,the taxpayers around Australia and then paid out,101
NA,this grants BUl to the Victorian Govern-,101
NA,so that it can do that sort of thing with it.,101
NA,That is only the start; it is not the end of it. I have,101
NA,1 of the here a quotation from a meeting of the Liberal,101
NA,the Party in Victoria-a party of which the Chair has,101
NA,"Column 2 of no knowledge, of course, Mr Deputy Speaker.",101
NA,less the sum The quotation reads as follows:,101
NA,Many State Council delegates are anxious to know why,102
NA,"the Housing Minister in 1973, Mr Vance Dickie, rec-",102
NA,ommended that the Government buy land from Adelaide-,102
NA,"based Lensworth Finance when, it is claimed, it should have",102
NA,been dealing with someone else.,102
NA,"Lensworth, which made a $ 1.6m profit in 3 weeks on an",102
NA,"option for land at Sunbury, north of Melbourne, on Friday",102
NA,offered to make its files public to show it had nothing to hide.,102
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Jarman)-,102
NA,Order! The honourable member said at the be-,102
NA,ginning of his speech that he was going to suck to,102
NA,the contents ofthe Bill. I think he is now getting,102
NA,rather wide of it. I do not wish to unnecessarily,102
NA,restrict him in making the points he wishes to,102
NA,"make, but I think he should get back to the main",102
NA,substance ofthe Bill.,102
Mr KEITH JOHNSON, Mr Deputy,102
NA,"Speaker, with the greatest respect, I can under-",102
NA,stand your sensitivities on this matter.,102
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! The,102
NA,honourable member will withdraw that remark.,102
Mr KEITH JOHNSON,I beg your pardon?,102
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,The honourable,102
NA,member will withdraw that remark. He implied,102
NA,that the Chair was taking sides. I think he should,102
NA,withdraw that remark.,102
Mr KEITH JOHNSON,I did not suggest,102
NA,that the Chair was taking sides. I said that I could,102
NA,understand your sensitivities on the matter.,102
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Will you withdraw,102
NA,that remark?,102
Mr KEITH JOHNSON,"Yes, I will withdraw",102
NA,that remark and I shall continue in the vein I am,102
NA,"taking, Mr Deputy Speaker, because we are",102
NA,dealing with Commonwealth funds being made,102
NA,available to State governments. That is the sub-,102
NA,ject matter ofthe Bill. *,102
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,The honourable,102
NA,member may continue so long as he does not,102
NA,reflect on Mr Speaker or the Deputy Speaker.,102
Mr KEITH JOHNSON,I am going to give,102
NA,the Premier of Victoria hell. Is that all right?,102
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Yes. That is up to,102
NA,the honourable member; just so long as he sticks,102
NA,within the confines of the Bill.,102
Mr KEITH JOHNSON,I am sticking within,102
NA,the confines of the Bill because the matters I am,102
NA,mentioning are matters negotiated with some of,102
NA,"the funds provided to the Victorian Government,",102
NA,"a Liberal government, by the Government in",102
NA,Canberra.,102
NA,Mr Brown-Bu t not under this Bill.,102
Mr KEITH JOHNSON,I think the honour-,102
NA,able member for Diamond Valley interjected,102
NA,and said: 'Not under this Bill'. How can he,102
NA,"assure me that that is so? Taking up that point,",102
NA,how can any honourable member in this House,102
NA,assure me that it is so? The funds are made avail-,102
NA,able to the State Government and it can do what,102
NA,it wishes with them. That is acknowledged in the,102
NA,Bill. These are things that have occurred in the,102
NA,past. I am speaking in support of an amendment,102
NA,to the motion for the second reading ofthe Bill. It,102
NA,seems to me to be reasonable that I should raise,102
NA,them tonight and that I should warn the House,102
NA,of the foolishness of continuing to make funds,102
NA,available to State governments without knowing,102
NA,what is going to be done with them. That is all I,102
NA,am doing.,102
Mr HODGMAN ,lt has nothing to do with the,102
NA,Bill.,102
Mr KEITH JOHNSON,That sounds like,102
NA,"Peter MCCarthy from Tasmania, or somewhere,",102
NA,who is speaking. I want to read another quo-,102
NA,tation regarding the land deals in Victoria. It,102
NA,says:,102
NA,A new scandal about government land buys is about to,102
NA,break over the already dented image of the Victorian Prem-,102
NA,"ier, Mr Hamer's 'small 1' Liberal Government.",102
NA,"By comparison with the dogs of this war, who come in",102
NA,various shades but to all intents and purposes are Liberals,102
NA,working within Mr Hamer's own State party.,102
NA,It has become a truly dirty batde with groups of party,102
NA,members ferreting out whatever dirt they can find-,102
Mr CADMAN ," Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a",102
NA,point of order. The honourable member is not,102
NA,talking to the Bill. He is talking about a pohtical,102
NA,party in Victoria. He is not talking about the,102
NA,funds that will be granted under this Bill in the,102
NA,year to come. He is being completely irrelevant.,102
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Jarman)-I up-,102
NA,hold the point of order. I have warned the,102
NA,honourable member for Burke that he has been,102
NA,getting too far away from the contents of the Bill,102
NA,before the House. I ask him to stick to the Bill. At,102
NA,"the beginning ofhis speech, when he was criticis-",102
NA,"ing the previous speaker, he pointed out that we",102
NA,were not facing an election in Victoria. I think the,102
NA,same remark could apply to him. I suggest that,102
NA,he keep within the confines of the Bill.,102
Mr KEITH JOHNSON,"A11 right, Mr",102
NA,Deputy Speaker. That is your ruling on the mat-,102
NA,"ter, and I am one of those people who obey the",102
NA,rulings of the Chair on all occasions. In the eight,102
NA,years that I have been here I have never been,102
NA,emptied out of the chamber. I have no great,102
NA,desire to be so treated for the firsttimetonight.,102
NA,Mr Jull-Th e honourable member was a good,102
NA,truck driver.,102
Mr KEITH JOHNSON,I was the best in,102
NA,Victoria. I can understand the sensitivity of the,102
NA,members of the Liberal Party who are sitting,103
NA,this chamber. They know ofthe corruption ofthethat,103
NA,"Victorian Government, they know of the corruppandering",103
NA,tion of their own Government and they know of,103
NA,the bankruptcy that exists.,103
NA,I refer now to an area that was touched on,103
NA,the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Uren).,103
NA,We are talking about funds for the States.,103
NA,mentioned the discontinuation of the sewerage,103
NA,program. I notice that the honourable member,103
NA,for Diamond Valley is smiling. I think there,103
NA,more unsewered houses in his electorate than,103
NA,almost any other electorate. I do not know how,103
NA,he dares to go home and face his electorate,103
NA,tell the people there that there are no funds avail-made,103
NA,able this year for sewerage programs. I received,103
NA,a letter from the Commissioner of the city of,103
NA,"Keilor, Mr Kevin Holland. He wrote to me as he",103
NA,is the sole representative in that area who has,103
NA,been appointed by the Liberal Government in,103
NA,Victoria. He has the sole responsibihty for,103
NA,aging that very large municipality. He rates,103
NA,complained to me in the most bitter terms that,103
NA,there will be no Avstralian Government funds,103
NA,coming to that municipahty to enable the Board,103
NA,"of Works to extend the sewerage program,",103
NA,so the people who Uve in that municipaUty wtil,103
NA,not have the opportunity to press a button,103
NA,instead of having somebody come round to the,103
NA,back door in the middle of the night. It is true,103
NA,that there is a large area of Melbourne still,103
NA,unsewered. It is true that there is a large numbergreat,103
NA,of septic tanks. It is also true that Port Phillip,103
NA,is probably the largest septic tank in the,103
NA,We have adopted this so-called new federalbers,103
NA,"ism, this chicanery offered to the people of",103
NA,"AustraUa, but not believed by them I might add,",103
NA,under which die AustraUan Government will,103
NA,make some funds available to the poor old Statestheir,103
NA,who wtil have to pick up the tab. Nobody,103
NA,ever explained to me why this is so or how the,103
NA,States can raise their funds equitably. It is,103
NA,ous to every thinking Australian,103
NA,who sit on the other side of this chamber,103
NA,most equitable way in which to raise finance,103
NA,through the Australian Government which can It,103
NA,reach into the people's pockets depending on the,103
NA,"depth of them rather than charge people left,",103
NA,right and centre. I make no apology for any taxes,103
NA,that the Labor Government levied on people. I,103
NA,was in local government for 11 years before com-one,103
NA,ing to this place and never stood on a cheap,103
NA,platform. I have never gone out to pretend to,103
NA,people about what I am offering or to treat,103
NA,to untruths. I would not do it in a Federal,103
NA,tion either.,103
NA,in Anybody who goes out to the people and says,103
NA,he will give them a cheap tax program is,103
NA,to the top wage earners but certainly,103
NA,not to the middle class because they are not bet-,103
NA,ter off now. I wtil give honourable members op-,103
NA,"posite a poUtical lesson, but certainly not you, Mr",103
NA,"by Deputy Speaker, because I do not wish to be",103
NA,"offensive to the Chair, it being apoUtical. If",103
NA,He honourable members opposite tell the middle,103
NA,"class people that they wtil reduce their taxes, the",103
NA,people will laugh at them and walk away be-,103
NA,are cause that is the class of people who demand,103
NA,in more of government than any other class in this,103
NA,country. They know better than the honourable,103
NA,and member for Eden-Monaro ( Mr Sainsbury) who,103
NA,an erudite exposition to this House tonight,103
NA,that the taxpayer pays. I would never teU people,103
NA,that I would reduce taxes. What I would say is,103
NA,that they wtil get fair value for their taxes which,103
NA,wtil be raised according to their capacity to pay,103
NA,rather than by way of State taxes because State,103
NA,mantaxes are most inequitable-a s inequitable as,103
NA,raised by local government which are just a,103
NA,flat property tax across the board. I notice the,103
NA,honourable member for Diamond Valley nod-,103
NA,ding his head again. I hope that he is not going to,103
NA,and sleep but is agreeing with me.,103
NA,"Mr Brown-Yo u would have to increase taxes,",103
NA,would you not?,103
Mr KEITH JOHNSON,Not necessarily.,103
NA,The Government at the moment is making a,103
NA,virtue of reducing taxes but to reduce taxes,103
NA,Baymeans to reduce services. The very people with,103
NA,world. whom the honourable member for Canbena,103
NA,( Mr Haslem) and the 55 other honourable mem-,103
NA,who will go with him at the next election are,103
NA,trying to curry favour in their last ditch bid to,103
NA,"hold office, those people they trust will come for-",103
NA,ward to support them when they tell them that,103
NA,"taxes will be reduced, will not beUeve the",103
NA,has honourable members because the people know,103
NA,that if they want services they are going to have,103
NA,obvito be paid for and the people know who wUl be,103
NA,including those paying for them.,103
NA,that the I support the amendment moved by the,103
NA,is honourable member for Adelaide ( Mr Hurford).,103
NA,"is obvious that if this BiU is passed, and I sup-",103
NA,"pose by some intuitive process that it will be, it",103
NA,wUl reduce the funds available to the States in,103
NA,real terms and increase the States' borrowing,103
NA,costs. Surely the cost of servicing debts must be,103
NA,ofthe greatest worries of State governments,103
NA,ratesand instrumentaUties. It forces the States to,103
NA,the reduce the services they provide and/or to,103
NA,themimpose additional taxes and charges. It leads,103
NA,elecalso to increased unemployment. The Prime,103
NA,Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) now realises his,103
NA,mistake because the Minister for Social Security,104
NA,(Senator Guilfoyle) had to tell him yesterday,104
NA,that he has been making a virtue of cutting back,104
NA,on staff. He is trying to impress this virtue upon,104
NA,the State governments but those governments,104
NA,which have intelligent Premiers-Ne w South,104
NA,"Wales, South Austraha and Tasmania-will not",104
NA,wear it.,104
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Jarman)-,104
NA,Order! The honourable member's dme has,104
NA,expired.,104
Mr CORBETT ,Maranoa) (10.15)-We have,104
NA,just listened to the honourable member for,104
NA,Burke ( Mr Keith Johnson) who seemed to,104
NA,wander a bit. He also seemed very concerned,104
NA,about the situation in Victoria and asked us to,104
NA,prove that money was provided under the Bill. I,104
NA,think the boot should have been on the other,104
NA,foot. If he is complaining about money not being,104
NA,provided under the Bill he should prove that that,104
NA,is the case. This Bill is part of the package of,104
NA,finance for the States distributed by the Com-,104
NA,monwealth Government. One cannot but be,104
NA,critical of the incessant clamouring of State,104
NA,governments and State politicians about the limi-,104
NA,tation of funds to the States by the Federal,104
NA,Government. These unjust and ill-founded utter-,104
NA,ances should be put to rest once and for all.,104
NA,There is far too much complaint from the States,104
NA,about the funds they get from the Common-,104
NA,"wealth. Under this Bill, which owes its existence",104
NA,to arrangements formulated by Liberal-National,104
NA,"Country Party governments in years gone by, the",104
NA,States will receive an injection of some,104
NA,$477.933m as a straight out grant. There is ho,104
NA,interest payable on it. There is no repayment and,104
NA,there is JO control. The States have complete,104
NA,autonomy in regard to what they do with this,104
NA,money. It is part of the total Loan Council,104
NA,"gram of $ 1,433.8m for the year 1977-78.",104
NA,The States will receive under tax sharing,104
NA,"lation announced in the Budget $4,336.lm,",104
NA,increase of $62lm or 16.8 per cent on the preincrease,104
NA,vious year. Yet the Opposition in its amendment,104
NA,claims that in real terms this is reducing the funds,104
NA,available to the States. How can that properly,104
NA,claimed under the circumstances? When one This,104
NA,takes into account Loan Council programs and,104
NA,"other special grants to the States, total general",104
NA,purpose grants to the States are estimated to,104
NA,increase by $685.lm in 1977-78. This again is,104
NA,contradiction of the amendment moved by the,104
NA,Opposition. All State governments therefore,104
NA,should be able to bring down Budgets which will,104
NA,provide maximum services without any increase,104
NA,in State taxation either direct or indirect. In,104
NA,the States get a very good deal from the Com-,104
NA,monwealth Government although they do not,104
NA,always acknowledge it. They do not have any,104
NA,excuse if their objectives cannot be achieved in a,104
NA,reasonabletime.No State government needs to,104
NA,be comprised of financial wizards to make its,104
NA,budget balance in view of the generosity of the,104
NA,Commonwealth Government-an d that should,104
NA,be emphasised- a generosity which has to be,104
NA,maintained under very difficult financial,104
NA,circumstances.,104
NA,Under this Bill every possible consideration,104
NA,has been extended to the States. It allocates,104
NA,money without an interest component. The grant,104
NA,component was introduced because of a realis-,104
NA,ation by the Commonwealth Government that,104
NA,some State government responsibilities do not,104
NA,attract any income and it is reasonable that the,104
NA,States should get money free of interest to service,104
NA,those responsibilities. In this regard we can men-,104
NA,"tion the money spent on education, on the pro-",104
NA,vision of schools and police stations. They are,104
NA,what might be termed essential needs in a mod-,104
NA,ern era. Interest is charged on other Loan Coun-,104
NA,cil programs by virtue of the fact that money,104
NA,expended by State governments on such things,104
NA,as power houses and dams does attract a finan-,104
NA,cial return. An examination of Budget Paper No.,104
NA,6 for the years 1976-77 and 1977-78 reveals,104
NA,some other interesting facts. In 1976-77 the se-,104
NA,curities on issue on account of the States per head,104
NA,of population at 30 June 1976 were as follow: In,104
NA,New South Wales $770.64; in Victoria $766.18;,104
NA,in Queensland $762.74; in South Australia,104
NA,"$1,117.15; in Western Australia $952.95; and in",104
NA,"Tasmania $1,837, giving an average debt of",104
NA,$848.94.,104
NA,"The annual interest liablitity per head, State",104
NA,"proby State, was: New South Wales, $54.58; Vic-",104
NA,"toria, $54.40; Queensland, $52.80; South",104
NA,"Australia, $80.09; Western Austraha, $68.05;",104
NA,legisand Tasmania $130.90. That means an average,104
NA,an interest of $60.14 per head. There was an,104
NA,in 1977 both in the amounts and in the,104
NA,"interest. For example, the average interest went",104
NA,"up from $60.14 to $65.53, showing that a lot of",104
NA,be money is being invested in Government bonds.,104
NA,is partly due to the fact that this money is,104
NA,made available to the States. Notwithstanding,104
NA,the fact that the Commonwealth gives money to,104
NA,"the States free of interest as a grant, under the",104
NA,"conditions which I have just enumerated, it is",104
NA,disturbing to note that people in all States have,104
NA,this increasing amount of funds going into bonds,104
NA,"and, consequently, an increasing debt through",104
NA,the Commonwealth to Australian bond holders.,104
NA,fact I hope to see an expansion of investment in,104
NA,enterprises which will provide employment and,105
NA,generally increase the welfare of the community,105
NA,as a whole.,105
NA,"Similarly, in Budget Paper No. 6, Table No. 8,",105
NA,wefindthat total securides on issue per head of,105
NA,"population, as far as the Commonwealth",105
NA,Government's debt to Austrahan bond holders is,105
NA,"concerned, shows an increase from $647.50 per",105
NA,head as at 30 June 1976 to $795.65 per head as,105
NA,at 30 June 1977. The point I am making is the,105
NA,need for the Government to try to make con-,105
NA,ditions available which will attract that money,105
NA,into other avenues of investment. Unless we of,105
NA,the free enterprise parties do something to,105
NA,"reverse this trend of investment in bonds, we are",105
NA,failing in the trust which has been placed in us by,105
NA,those who owe their allegiance to our political,105
NA,philosophy. Quite obviously the Government,105
NA,has to create an environment which wtil maxi-,105
NA,mise the opportunities for people to invest in pri-,105
NA,vate enterprise with the hope of reward and not,105
NA,allow their funds to be used to a significant de-,105
NA,gree in the manner in which I have just been talk-,105
NA,"ing about, that is, to be used by the Government",105
NA,again for other developments. It is much better,105
NA,for the commumty at large to have this money,105
NA,flowing through private enterprise investment.,105
NA,We have to create an environment where porters,105
NA,people will take risks in creating job opportunigovernment-interes,105
NA,ties by allowing them a reasonable chance of,105
NA,reward for effort expended and risks undertaken.,105
NA,This is something which the Opposition will,105
NA,never concede. Honourable members opposite,105
NA,say that if there is a falling off in expenditure and,105
NA,"labour in the private enterprise section, they will",105
NA,make that up with Government enterprise. That under,105
NA,has been a great failure. It was a tragic failure in high interest,105
NA,the years when Labor was in office. We as a traUans the opportunity,105
NA,Government have a responsibility to accept the homes and to purchase some,105
NA,challenge to carefully examine ways of improv-,105
NA,"ing productivity and, consequently, competiUfe",105
NA,tiveness. State governments must also be madedous,105
NA,aware of this. There should be general cothat,105
NA,operation in this area. I want to be critical of a words,105
NA,growing feeling in many areas of Australia of a Whitlam,105
NA,point of view which calls upon the Government infectiousGovernment,105
NA,to provide all types of services.,105
NA,when it was in government encouraged too much interest rates.correspondingly,105
NA,dependence on the Government. That is somedid reduce interest,105
NA,"thing we should try to overcome. It is not easy, time is appropriate for",105
NA,but we should make the attempt. My political,105
NA,philosophy leads mefirmlyto the point of view,105
NA,"that what we want is more initiative, more",105
NA,tralians paying their own way and less governments,105
NA,ment interference in the basic responsibilities,105
NA,the individual. There should be less union interSome,105
NA,ference and fewer trivial and unjustified strikes.,105
NA,Governments should be providing only the foun-,105
NA,dation for development for the Australian,105
NA,people. The people should supply the basic,105
NA,framework and butid on that under a free,105
NA,enterprise system.,105
NA,This Bill goes part of the way in decreasing the,105
NA,amount of interest paid by State governments.,105
NA,"Again, this is contrary to the amendment moved",105
NA,by the Opposition. One of the thrusts of the,105
NA,"Budget, of course, is to reduce interest rates. A",105
NA,"deficit of reasonable proportions, such as this",105
NA,"year's deficit, is the catalyst which wtil allow",105
NA,interest rates to decrease. This is something,105
NA,which the Austrahan Labor Party Government,105
NA,never recognised and does not seem to recognise,105
NA,now. Australia has been pricing itself out of,105
NA,world markets. Interest has been a contributing,105
NA,factor to this. The statistical bulletin put out by,105
NA,the Reserve Bank of Australia in June 1976,105
NA,shows that the interest rate in June 1973 was 7.75,105
NA,per cent for trading bank overdraft and that,105
NA,increased to 9.5 per cent in June 1974 and to 11.5,105
NA,"per cent in June 1975, the last year of the",105
NA,Whitlam regime. It is interesting to note that in,105
NA,"February 1976, a few months after the Fraser-",105
NA,Anthony Government was returned to office with,105
NA,an overwhelming majority of support from the,105
NA,Australian people-that showed Labor sup-,105
NA,what the people thought of their type of,105
NA,t rates were reduced to 10.5,105
NA,a per cent per annum. Quite obviously this is,105
NA,intolerably high. It has mitigated against people,105
NA,being able to compete in international markets.,105
Mr BRYANT ,Whe n are you going to reduce it?,105
Mr CORBETT,The rate was 11.5 per cent,105
NA,your Government; do not forget that. This,105
NA,rate has denied many young Aus-,105
NA,to purchase their own,105
NA,of the comforts of,105
NA,which aUow people to absorb the tremen-,105
NA,pressures exerted by modern living; and,105
NA,is what this Government aims to do. Actions,105
NA,speak louder than words. We take action. We get,105
NA,"from the other side, but no action. The",105
NA,quite obviously had an,105
NA,enthusiasm for huge deficits in the,105
NA,The Opposition Budget with,105
NA,regular increases in,105
NA,The Fraser-Anthony Government,105
NA,rates and I beUeve that the,105
NA,further reductions.,105
NA,This Bill is positive proof that relationships be-,105
NA,Austween the State and the Commonwealth govern-,105
NA,should be a partnership. A partnership,105
NA,of automatically denotes a share of responsibUity.,105
NA,of the States appear to me to look upon a,105
NA,partnership as something which allows them to,105
NA,have a vice Uke grip on the right to have,106
NA,"troUed spending, and absolute",106
NA,this Government without having to act,106
NA,responsibly because they get money,106
NA,lected by this Government. For too long too,106
NA,many of them have been telling the,106
NA,loud and long about aU they would do if only,106
NA,they could get more money from the Federal,106
NA,Government. I ask honourable members to bear,106
NA,in mind that the Federal Government has,106
NA,reduced the deficit from $4.5 bUUon to $2.2,106
NA,billion in an endeavour to get,106
NA,economy back on to a reasonably sound basis.,106
NA,Under a BUl which has been introduced into honourable,106
NA,the Parhament-th e Income Tax (Arrangements 10.30 p.m.,106
NA,with the States) BUl 1977-al l the States have the,106
NA,right to raise their own taxes but they wiU,106
NA,this because it is not poUticaUy advantageous,106
NA,do so. It is about time they gave up blaming,106
NA,Commonwealth Government for being unable,106
NA,to accede to the insatible demands of their electo,106
NA,tors. For too long they have avoided telhng the,106
NA,people that increased services can be provided on.,106
NA,only through increased taxation. They have,106
NA,avoided telhng the people that.,106
NA,should be telling the people. It is not good,106
NA,enough to blame the Commonwealth. As part-,106
NA,ners they must also share the responsibUity. I,106
NA,plore the atutudes of some of the State,106
NA,ments in their approach to this,106
NA,are not a federalist government but I suggest to,106
NA,"some of the States that, if they want to be par-",106
NA,"tners in a truly co-operative federal system, they",106
NA,also have a responsibUity to Uve within their,106
NA,Budgets and to prune their expenditure so,106
NA,our greatest problem-mflation-ca n be con-,106
NA,trolled. We must bring back into the AustraUan,106
NA,"poUtical community some blunt, straight forward",106
NA,honesty in assessing what can and what,106
NA,be done.,106
NA,The Federal Government has indicated to,106
NA,States in this Bill that it realises the many,106
NA,ing problems the States have. State governments,106
NA,are a lot better off than they were last year.,106
NA,is a contradiction to the amendment moved,106
NA,the Opposition because the States have received,106
NA,"increased amounts. The Commonwealth, neverwhich",106
NA,"theless, has contained its spending. It has set an country?",106
NA,example and it wUl continue to do that. When we,106
NA,go to the people again the false hopes,106
NA,sition supporters have that they might win some,106
NA,of the seats on this side at which,106
NA,viously wUl be dissipated. I have very much,106
NA,pleasure in supporting the BUl and opposing this,106
NA,amendment which is in every aspect quite the,106
NA,posite to what the BUl proposes.,106
NA,uncon Mr Crean- I wish to move that the debate be,106
NA,right to criticise now adjourned.,106
NA,Mr Macphee- I require that the question be,106

NA,STATES GRANTS (CAPITAL,107
NA,ASSISTANCE) BILL 1977,107
NA,Second Reading,107
NA,Debate resumed.,107
Mr CREAN ,Melbourne Ports) (10.31)-I t,107
NA,would be much more pleasant if we knew what,107
NA,was happening. My understanding was that the,107
NA,debate would be interrupted at 10.30 p.m.,107
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,I t is a matter for real,107
NA,the Government whether the House continues.,107
Mr CREAN,I accept that. I draw the attendrop,107
NA,tion of the House to the Budget Paper entitled,107
NA,'Payments to or for the States and Local Governto,107
NA,ment Authorities 1977-78'. At page 6 details of,107
NA,funds to the States for capital purposes are prothere,107
NA,vided. They are divided into two groupstions,107
NA,"general purpose capital funds, of which this Bill",107
NA,"is part, and specific purpose payments for capital",107
NA,purposes. A total for die two groups is given. For,107
NA,"1976-77, as against 1975-76, there was a decline",107
NA,of 3.6 per cent. For 1977-78 it is estimated that,107
NA,there will be a decline of one per cent when,107
NA,"pared with thefigurefor the previous year, which",107
NA,had been a decline also. It means that in real,107
NA,terms the sums being granted to the States for,107
NA,capital funds are less this year. They were less,107
NA,previous year. These are in money terms only.,107
NA,When one takes into account inflation and the,107
NA,"like, in real terms capital expenditure is less this",107
NA,"year, and it was less last year.",107
NA,also to page 10 of the Budget Paper entitled,107
NA,'National Income and Expenditure 1976-77'. At,107
NA,"current prices, grossfixedcapital expenditure",107
NA,all public authorities rose by 9 per cent in,107
NA,1976-77 but fell by 2 per cent at constant prices.,107
NA,Surely at atimewhen we have a substantial,107
NA,number of unemployed affecting the economy no,107
NA,one can justify capital expenditure being less,107
NA,real terms than previously. I sometimes wonder,107
NA,at the rather curious economic theories Grants,107
NA,propagated about solving the unemployment,107
NA,problem. Surely at the moment one means,107
NA,increasing employment would be to put into,107
NA,capital expenditure expenditure in the same real,107
NA,at least as previously. I do not beheve that,107
NA,all those who are currendy unemployed can sud-,107
NA,be absorbed in pubhc works programs. I,107
NA,this is one ofthe great difficulties with un-,107
NA,not employment at the moment. It has been said on,107
NA,We this side of the House by quite a number of,107
NA,speakers that one of the difficulties is matching,107
NA,the demands that are still in the community for,107
NA,labour resources against the skills or lack of skills,107
NA,the that are currently available.,107
NA,The White Paper on National Income and,107
NA,Expenditure gives a number of interesting stat-,107
NA,istics about capital expenditure. I refer to table,107
NA,18 on page 22 entitled Gross Fixed Capital,107
NA,"Expenditure on New Assets, by Purpose. It",107
NA,"shows that Federal authorities in 1976-77, as",107
NA,"against 1975-76, which I have mentioned, were",107
NA,"spending, in real terms, less than the amounts",107
NA,spent in the previous Budget. There was less,107
NA,spent on education in real terms. There was less,107
NA,"spent on health, social security and welfare in",107
NA,terms. There was a very substantial drop in,107
NA,transport facilities. There was a very substantial,107
NA,in the item called 'All other'. Surely at the,107
NA,moment nobody can suggest that if we are able,107
NA,match people out of work with facilities that,107
NA,"we lack, it is inflationary. Can anybody suggest if",107
NA,"are shortages of nursing homes, police sta-",107
NA,and pre-school facilities and people are out,107
NA,of work that somehow it is violating some sound,107
NA,economic canon by putting to work the people,107
NA,who are out of work to do the sorts of jobs which,107
NA,wtil provide the facilities that are lacking? This is,107
NA,the reality in Australia at the moment. There is,107
NA,"comno doubt, and the aggregate statistics in the",107
NA,document entitled 'Payments to or for the States,107
NA,and Local Government Authorities' show that in,107
NA,real terms capital expenditure at all levels of,107
NA,"the government in Australia, whether Federal, State",107
NA,"or local, is less this year than the previous year.",107
NA,"Yet the Government, for some reason, expects us",107
NA,to commend it this year for what it says are very,107
NA,I draw attention substantial sums.,107
NA,Surely we all understand now that if inflation,107
NA,is at a minimum nearly 10 per cent-th e Govern-,107
NA,by ment has not brought the rate of inflation below,107
NA,10 per cent; it was horrified when it was above 10,107
NA,per cent during the term of the Labor Govern-,107
NA,ment but it has done nothing to bring it below 10,107
NA,per cent-w e can no longer simply take nominal,107
NA,in sums and regard them as indicative of perform-,107
NA,ance. In his second reading speech on the States,107
NA,"(Capital Assistance) Bill, the Mimster for",107
NA,Aboriginal Affairs ( Mr Viner) representing the,107
NA,of Treasurer ( Mr Lynch) at the time said:,107
NA,The purpose of this Bill is to authorise the payment of,107
NA,capital grants to the States in 1977-78 totalling,107
NA,"$477,933,000. This amount represents the grant component",108
NA,of the Loan CouncU program for State governments in,108
NA,"1977-78, and is one-third of the total program of",108
NA,"$l,433.8m . . .",108
NA,"That $l,433.8m means a percentage increase in",108
NA,1976-77 of 5.7 per cent when there was an came,108
NA,increase in prices in that period of nearly 13 per,108
NA,"cent. Surely that would mean a decline, in real",108
NA,"terms, in what we are able to do with that sum",108
NA,money. When it is obvious that the private sector,108
NA,of the economy is not prepared to take,108
NA,"slack which exists, surely there is an obligation",108
NA,on the pubhc sector to do so. One way by which,108
NA,the pubhc sector could increase real,108
NA,in the community is for it to be provided with,108
NA,greater sums of money.,108
NA,I suppose we get back to the awful obsession,108
NA,with this thing called 'the deficit'-th e difference,108
NA,between the total expenditure,108
NA,has to meet and the resources it has available,108
NA,meet that expenditure. The Government calls the,108
NA,difference 'the deficit'. This year the Government,108
NA,sees great virtue in the fact that the deficit is,108
NA,billion instead of $2.7 billion.,108
NA,honourable member on the other side of the,108
NA,House to stand up and argue that the perfor-,108
NA,mance of the economy would be worse if we,108
NA,were to spend another $500m in the,108
NA,in lieu of performance by the private,108
NA,"didly, I do not think any honourable members",108
NA,opposite could do that.,108
NA,Mr Groom-Inflatio n would be higher.,108
Mr CREAN,Wh y would inflation be higher?,108
NA,Mr Groom-O f course it would be higher.,108
Mr CREAN,Th e honourable gentleman,108
NA,states that inflation would be higher. I should,108
NA,like to hear the profundity of his explanation.,108
NA,Why would putting people into work,108
NA,assets which the commumty needs be any more,108
NA,inflationary than paying the unemployment,108
NA,"benefit from pubhc revenues, which at",108
NA,ment is costing $800m? I do not know what,108
NA,the honourable gentleman who interjected holds,108
NA,and I do not know whether he will be returned,108
NA,the next general election. He ought to go,108
NA,his electorate and say to the unemployed people,108
NA,there that he does not think that putting,108
NA,work would be a good thing and that what they,108
NA,are doing is helping to abate inflation. Does the,108
NA,honourable gentleman seriously maintain that?,108
NA,At the moment this Government is paying out,108
NA,of the tax collected from those who are working,108
NA,sum of $800m in unemployment benefit to,108
NA,people who are not working. In most cases the,108
NA,Government is paying near enough to one-half,108
NA,or two-thirds of a wage to people,108
NA,"nothing. Would it not be more sensible and, I",108
NA,"suggest, no more inflationary to pay them a full",108
NA,wage to do something that would be socially use-,108
NA,ful? I know that the honourable gendeman who,108
NA,interjected has not been here for very long. He,108
NA,"here in the euphoria of the last election, as",108
NA,part of the greatest majority ever to be elected in,108
NA,the history of this country. But he can hardly be-,108
NA,of lieve that the economy is any better because of,108
NA,the things which he claims his Government has,108
NA,up the changed. Is inflation any less?,108
NA,"Mr Groom-Yes , it is less.",108
Mr CREAN,How much less?,108
NA,Mr Groom-Si x per cent less.,108
Mr CREAN,I s unemployment any less?,108
NA,"Mr Groom-You put 100,000 people out of",108
NA,the Government work in one year.,108
Mr CREAN,Th e honourable gentleman has,108
NA,been very frank in giving an answer about infla-,108
NA,tion. I simply ask mm: Is unemployment in the,108
NA,$2.2 electorate he represents any less than it was 2,108
NA,I should like some years ago?,108
NA,"Mr Groom-Yes , than it was in January 1976.",108
Mr CREAN,Tha n it was when you were,108
NA,public sector elected to this Parhament?,108
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Jarman)-,108
NA,Order! I suggest that all remarks be directed to,108
NA,the Chair and channelled through the Chair. I do,108
NA,not think that this cross-fire across the chamber,108
NA,should be tolerated.,108
NA,Mr Innes- I rise to a point of order.,108
Mr HODGMAN ,H e is out ofhis seat.,108
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,"Yes, the honour-",108
NA,able member for Melbourne is out ofhis seat. He,108
NA,to create must resume his seat.,108
NA,Mr Innes- I have done so. My point of order is,108
NA,that the honourable member for Braddon is,108
NA,the mointerjecting from out ofhis seat.,108
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,That is correct. If,108
NA,the honourable member for Braddon wishes to,108
NA,in interject he should return to his own seat. Even,108
NA,back to then I will not allow him to do so.,108
Mr CREAN,I am sure that the honourable,108
NA,member for Braddon will be out of his seat in a,108
NA,short while. He will be out of his seat if he is pre-,108
NA,pared to go back to the electorate he represents,108
NA,and say that the total unemployment in that elec-,108
NA,torate is less than it was when he came into the,108
NA,a seat. He is silent about that proposition.,108
NA,Mr Groom-Chec k on the facts.,108
Mr CREAN,What I asked of him and what,108
NA,who are doing he was brash enough to-,108
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,I f the honourable,109
NA,member for Braddon wishes to interject,109
NA,better go back to his seat to do it.,109
Mr CREAN,Th e honourable member for,109
NA,Braddon was brash enough to suggest that,109
NA,people were put to work performing what mightwhom,109
NA,be called socially useful tasks it would cause,109
NA,inflation. I hope he will go and tell his electoratehas,109
NA,that I simply think that this is an example ofthespeaks,109
NA,kind of economic nonsense that is being perHouse,109
NA,petrated in the system at the moment I beheve,109
NA,that it is economic nonsense to pay a person,109
NA,something between one-half and two-thirds of,109
NA,wage for doing nothing when there are plenty offederation.,109
NA,tasks remaining to be done- I would suggest that,109
NA,that applies no less in his electorate wan any-,109
NA,where else in the rest of Australia-th e doing,109
NA,which could be socially useful. I said to this,109
NA,porter of the Government from Tasmania the respected,109
NA,other day that he is a 'Tassiephile'. Hisfilesarecase.,109

NA,At least I try to be frank about this matter. I smaUer,109
NA,suggest that none of us is yet facing up to the,109

NA,rather stily at the moment if we do not beUeve,109
NA,that the situation would be improved if we weregovernmental,109
NA,prepared to spend more in real terms on what,109
NA,often described by the use of a rather hackneyedare,109

NA,caUed beneficial grants is less hi realtermsthis,109

Mr CADMAN,Sinc e the Second World War,109
NA,there has been an increasing aUocation of funds,109
NA,the Federal Government for things such as,109
NA,and social development to State and,109
NA,government. In 1976-77financialassist-,109
NA,grants were replaced by an arrangement,109
NA,under which State governments are entitled to a,109
NA,tospecified share of Commonwealth net personal,109
NA,tax coUections. If we look at the assist-,109
NA,theance being provided to the States in the table on,109
NA,anpage 8 of the Treasury document 'Payments to,109
NA,5 or for the States and Local Government Authori-,109
NA,ties' wefindthat the aUocation of general pur-,109

NA,The increased borrowing capacity of the States,110
NA,has been enunciated by previous speakers. I,110
NA,dorse their comments. Honourable members on,110
NA,this side of the House understand how to read,110
NA,Budget papers. They recognise the increased,110
NA,pacity of State governments. Opposition memunanimously,110
NA,bers say that this proposal has forced the Statesaccess,110
NA,to reduce the services they provide. How could,110
NA,it? During the last 12 months the States have,110
NA,"increased their public servants by 20,000.",110

Mr CADMAN,"Th e States have increased, as",110
NA,"the honourable member for Braddon says, by",110

NA,of the staff they employ. The honourable memgive,110
NA,"ber for Adelaide ( Mr Hurford), in his",110
NA,"ment, claims to represent the views ofthe Oppo-",110
NA,sition and understand these matters. Why do,110
NA,honourable members opposite not assess what,110
NA,local governments and State governments are,110
NA,"doing? Why do they not look at their accounts,",110
NA,and look at what they are really achieving and,110
NA,what they are delivering? How can it be that withiers,110
NA,"an increased staff of 20,000 pubhc servants sertheir",110
NA,vices are decreasing? One would perhaps tend totax.,110
NA,think that the New South Wales Government it,110
NA,might be decreasing its services when one looksa,110
NA,at the pubhc transport system in that State. It,110
NA,a massive deficit of $300m. This is after the,110
NA,"Labor Party went to the people claiming, in",110
NA,that one of its priorities as a government,110
NA,be to improve the public transport services,110
NA,that State. It has not done so. The dangerous,110
NA,"ditions, with derailments still apply.",110
NA,We have further statements that the Bill will,110
NA,lead to increased unemployment. This Bill is not,110
NA,related to matters of unemployment. The wished,110
NA,"honourable member for Melbourne Ports, mencould",110
NA,tioned some programs. I take it he was referring,110
NA,to programs something like the RED scheme. Heposals.,110
NA,must recognise the huge expense involved in thatStates,110
NA,program by paying full salaries and making all,110
NA,it. those arrangements. In fact the honourable,110
NA,member's own Party eventually rejected that,110
NA,It was an incredibly imaginative pro-,110
NA,gram but an incredibly incompetent one. It did,110
NA,achieve the objectives. The Labor Party,110
NA,rejected it and all AustraUansrejectedit. They,110
NA,the concept; they rejected the prac-,110
NA,tice. What we need is not greater assistance m the,110
NA,form of loan moneys to State governments but,110
NA,an expanding opportunity and a control of,110
NA,an expanding opportunity for business,110
NA,such as this Government has been able to pro-,110
NA,and also a restriction ofthe continual wage,110
NA,with which we have been pressed in the,110
NA,enState governments have consistently expressed,110
NA,the view that over a long period the arrange-,110
NA,ments which they previously worked under were,110
NA,"caunsatisfactory. In fact in 1970, the six States",110
NA,proposed that they be given direct,110
NA,to income tax broadly along the lines of,110
NA,the scheme that operated then in Canada. In,110
NA,1975 they proposed again unanimously that the,110
NA,general revenue grants arrangements should be,110
NA,based on the principle that the States should be,110
NA,compensated for their lack of access to income,110
NA,tax. This principle has been recognised by the,110
NA,present Government. In fact as part ofits feder-,110
NA,wayaUsm program it has given and wtil continue to,110
NA,the States the opportunity to take up tax-,110
NA,amendation on behalf of their people.,110
NA,What is happening at the moment? Through,110
NA,the State Premiers there is a de facto taxing,110
NA,power given to the States. They have a share of,110
NA,taxation which they set. They have a share of,110
NA,at33.6 per cent. By common agreement the Prem-,110
NA,of AustraUa have agreed to tax the people of,110
NA,States at that level on their personal income,110
NA,"What they need to do, of course, is to admit",110
NA,"and come out and say: 'Yes, we have agreed to",110
NA,tax level of 33.6 per cent on the people of our,110
NA,"hasStates, and we will take up the capacity to extend",110
NA,the level at which we wtil tax or reduce the level,110
NA,"fact,at which we wtil tax'. It would seem to be",110
NA,would sensible that from now on this Government,110
NA,in ought to show on tax forms and literature the,110
NA,con-levels of tax which the Premiers of each State,110
NA,have agreed to accept and to aUow the people of,110
NA,AustraUa to see the mcreased capacity of State,110
NA,governments to carry out works programs if they,110
NA,to take them up. This mcreased capacity,110
NA,be reflected in works programs if the,110
NA,people of particular States understood such pro-,110
NA,One has only to look at the record of aU,110
NA,to see their increased capacity in education,110
NA,"and transport, the additional loans they will redrive",111
NA,"ceive this year, the capacity of local government",111
NA,and the road programs that have been,111
NA,ced. The recommendations should be brought,111
NA,forward strongly to indicate to the Austrahan,111
NA,people that tax sharing capacity under federalI,111
NA,ism is something that is beneficial and that will,111
NA,allow a regionalisation of Federal Government,111
NA,pohcies. It is a possibility that State governments,111
NA,"can apply more specifically, economic programs",111
NA,"that it is not possible to apply from Canberra,",111
NA,except if one adopts the socialist control of every,111
NA,"aspect of human life, of State governments and",111
NA,of local government,111

NA,I thank the honourable member for Hughes,111

NA,some of the criticism that was directed at the,111
NA,New South Wales State Government by the,111
NA,honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr trying,111
NA,Wentworth) in regard to local government in,111
NA,"area of the city of Sydney-Leichhardt , MarrickUttle",111
NA,"ville, South Sydney and Botany. Tonight the",111
NA,honourable member for Mackellar stated that,111
NA,the funds given to the New South Wales State,111
NA,Government by the Federal Government had,111
NA,been mislaid by that Government. In other CouncU.,111
NA,"words, the New South Wales State Government",111
NA,had not used the funds provided under the,111
NA,was very disgusted when the honourable memRodwell?,111
NA,ber stated that the New South Wales State,111
NA,Government would rather use money on cars,111
NA,than on people. In his address to this House he,111
NA,said that the area of Glebe should be cut up.,111
NA,was incensed at what he said because,111
NA,"where I hve. Even before it came to office,",111
NA,Labor Party in New South Wales fought to stop,111
NA,the north-west expressway. The honourable,111
NA,member for Mackellar Uves on the other side,111
NA,"Sydney Harbour. Certainly, he is in the twitight",111
NA,of his Ufe. At his age I do not,111

NA,them. I hope he is fit to drive a car.,111
NA,announ Mr Katter-Coul d he drive one?,111
Mr LES MCMAHON, I do not know his age.,111
NA,know that he is in the twilight of his Ufe in the,111
NA,Liberal Party. Why I am upset is that he is inter-,111
NA,fering with the electorate of Sydney. There are,111
NA,"three expressways-th e north-western, the west-",111
NA,ern and the south expressway that is going,111
NA,through Botany. The honourable member said:,111
NA,'Knock aU the houses down. Cars before people'.,111
NA,Tonight he said that the State Government was,111
NA,squandering the funds. On Saturday there wtil be,111
NA,an election in the municipaUty of Warringah.,111
NA,The honourable member said that the Liberal,111
NA,would give its preferences to the indepen-,111
NA,rather than to the Labor Party. These pro-,111
NA,of ceedings are still being broadcast. I hope that,111
NA,people are still listening. Senator Sibraa who,111
NA,comes from New South Wales told me a couple,111
NA,to sub-of days ago that he was working hard in the area,111
NA,to help the people to look after the Warringah,111
NA,the area. He told me that there is a story going about,111
NA,the area to the effect that the honourable mem-,111

NA,"able member for Pittwater, Mr Webster, have",111
NA,made anangements with the independents to try,111

NA,people? I hope that he will take a point oforder,112
NA,against me and say that I am wrong. If he,112
NA,not do so it means that he is embarrassed.,112
NA,pleased to be able to say that the honourable,112
NA,member has a few doUars. He saved his money,112
NA,over the years. He has a great history of saving,112
NA,"his money,",112
NA,Mr Martyr-Ar e you saying that BUl does not,112
NA,shout?,112
Mr LES MCMAHON, I did not say that.,112
NA,would not say that.,112
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! I suggest,112
NA,again that interjections are not helpful. I would,112
NA,point out to the honourable member for Sydney,112
NA,that the fact that interjections are being,112
NA,does not aUow him to transgress the Standing,112
NA,Orders. I would say to the honourable member,112
NA,for Sydney what I said to the honourable memmania?,112
NA,ber for MackeUar I think he has explained sum,112
NA,sufficiently his point regarding the expenditure,112
NA,State grants on the subject matter he raised.,112
NA,suggest that we get back now to the real subject,112
NA,matter of the BiU before the House.,112
Mr LES MCMAHON,Agai n I appreciate the,112
NA,"your tolerance, Mr Deputy Speaker. I thank",112
NA,honourable member for Hughes for allowing,112
NA,to step into his place on the Ust of speakers,112
NA,night. If you agree that I have said what should,112
NA,be said I shaU allow the next speaker to carry,112
Mr HODGMAN ,Denison) (11.9)- I take pohcy,112
NA,Measure in rising to support this Bill even at this,112
NA,(ate hour. I feel somewhat Uke a rose between,112
NA,two thorns. I have been sandwiched between,112
NA,friend the honourable member for Sydney ( Mr,112
NA,Les MCMahon) and that great supporter of,112
NA,"uranium ntining and export, the honourable late",112
NA,"member for Hughes ( Mr Les Johnson), who I",112
NA,understand is to follow me in this debate. As sec-,112
NA,retary of the Government Members Federal sitting on $45m-,112
NA,Affairs Committee I support this legislation be-,112
NA,cause it represents yet another step forward in,112
NA,the introduction of the pohcy of new federaUsm,112
NA,to AustraUa. The stronger we can make our,112
NA,eral system the less Ukely is the chance that,112
NA,wtil ever again see this country inflicted with,112
NA,"tralist, sociahst, repubUcan government such as",112
NA,we saw during the three years of the Whitlam,112
NA,"Whether the Labor Party likes it or not,",112
NA,the plain fact about this legislation is that it ap-,112
NA,"to propriates the sum of $80m to the States, being",112
NA,"honourportion of a total of $5,775 bilUon-",112
NA,been a member Mr Abel-Ho w much?,112
Mr HODGMAN,$5.775 biltion which this,112
NA,year Canberra is making available to the States,112
NA,AustraUa. That represents an increase of 13.6,112
NA,per cent on last year. So any honourable mem-,112
NA,"does ber, such as the honourable member for",112
NA,I am Adelaide ( Mr Hurford) and the honourable,112
NA,"member for Melbourne Ports ( Mr Crean), who",112
NA,claims that there has been no real increase at aU,112
NA,in the funding of the States is talking through his,112
NA,"hat. The increase is 13.6 per cent, considerably",112
NA,"above the primary rate of mflation, which at the",112
NA,present moment is 9.2 per cent compared with a,112
NA,"disastrous, horrendous 16 per cent when Labor",112
NA,I was thrown out of office by the people of,112
NA,AustraUa on 13 December 1975.,112
NA,This BiU authorises the payment of capital,112
NA,grants to the States in 1977-78 totalling $477m.,112
NA,"It also provides for an additional amount, an al-",112
NA,"made location of $238m, representing the first 6",112
NA,months payment of capital grants for 1978-79.,112
NA,What does that mean to a small State Uke Tas-,112
NA,It means that under this BUl alone the,112
NA,of $50m is to be injected into the coffers of,112
NA,"of our State, a State which has never had it so good",112
NA,I since the federalist poUcies of the present,112
NA,"Government commenced to be implemented, a",112
NA,State which has done so weU that our Labor,112
NA,"Premier, who also happens to be the Treasurer of",112
NA,"State, for the last two Budgets has not been",112
NA,the able to spend all the money he got from Can-,112
NA,me berra. He has not been able to spend it! The,112
NA,"tosame man comes to Canberra and cries poverty,",112
NA,yet he is sitting on a goldmine in Hobart. There,112
NA,on. can be no greater compliment to our federaUsm,112
NA,than that the Premiers cannot spend the,112
NA,money that the States are receiving as a result of,112
NA,that federaUsm pohcy. Take the situation of the,112
NA,"my Premier of New South Wales, earUer today",112
NA,"referred to as Nifty Nev, and since his visit to",112
NA,Japan he has been referred to as Nippy Nev. As,112
NA,as one month before the end of the financial,112
NA,year Mr Wran was in a situation where he had,112
NA,$45m unspent in his loan fund. What is he doing,112
NA,Mr Abel-Whingeing .,112
Mr HODGMAN,"An d whingeing, as the",112
NA,"fedhonourable member for Evans points out, when",112
NA,we his State of New South Wales has the highest un-,112
NA,cen-employment in the Commonwealth? Why is he,112
NA,not prepared to spend that money to alleviate the,112
NA,hardship of the employment situation which his,112
NA,parUamentary coUeagues in the Labor Party,113
NA,this House are complaining about? People on,113
NA,this side of the House are complaining about it,113
NA,"too, and we got the secret a few moments ago.",113
NA,has put aside this money so that when he wants,113
NA,to cm an election early next year he wUl be ablethe,113
NA,to bring it out and say: 'Look what I have got!',113
NA,At the moment he is endeavouring to deceive,113
NA,people of New South Wales and the people of,113
NA,AustraUa by pretending that he has not got,113
NA,enough money.,113
NA,Look at the situation in Tasmania. In a small,113
NA,"State Uke Tasmania, which has unemployment",113
NA,"problems, although fortunately they have been",113
NA,aUeviated to large extent as a result of the poUthings,113
NA,"cies of this Government, we have the situation",113
NA,that in the last month of thefinancialyear the,113
NA,Premier found suddenly that he had to spend,113
NA,$41m out of his loan funds to avoid being pubreal,113
NA,Ucly exposed as having more money in the kitty,113
NA,than he had told the pubUc he had. The reason,113
NA,simply is that the new federaUsm poUcy has put,113
NA,more money into the pockets of the State Premunable,113
NA,iers than anything since Federation. Some,113
NA,them have the gall to cry poverty when they,113
NA,"come here, yet they sit on goldmines in then-",113
NA,States while men and women walk the streets out,113
NA,of work. We have the situation that the Housing,113
NA,"Department, the Department responsible for",113
NA,"welfare housing in our State, had to spend $4m",113
NA,in the last month of thefinancialyear. The story,113
NA,is that it did not get through that. We are told,113
NA,another $lm stacked away here and there.,113
NA,are told that the real Budget surplus was $8m,113
NA,and not $1.5m which Mr Netison pubUcly,113
NA,proclaimed. Mr Netison went further and added,113
NA,msult to injury by claiming that the Commoning,113
NA,wealth had short changed him by $6.7m. Mr,113
NA,Netison has a great capacity for saying 'I have,113
NA,"been short changed', and then when the",113
NA,monwealth asks him to put up an argument to,113
NA,the Grants Commission to get some more money,113
NA,he backs off very quickly. Three months ago,113
NA,said that Tasmania had been short changed by,113
NA,$4m. He had not done his arithmetic. The sad 13.6 per cent.,113
NA,fact is that since Mr Neilson has been Premier of,113
NA,Tasmania there has actuaUy been one period,113
NA,bis term in office when the population of our,113
NA,State declined. I cannot blame Mr Neilson,113
NA,"the decline in the population of Tasmania, but",113
NA,the fact is that it did happen. In the,113
NA,"quarter of 1976, under a Labor",113
NA,population of Tasmania actuaUy declined.,113
NA,We said to Mr Netison: 'If you claim that you,113
NA,"have not had a fair deal, why do you not go to",113
NA,in the Grants Commission?' The Grants Com-,113
NA,"mission was the brainchild of a Tasmanian, Pro-",113
NA,fessor Lyndhurst Giblin. It was created by a Tas-,113
NA,"He manian Prime Minister, Joseph Aloysius Lyons.",113
NA,It was put there for the benefit of Tasmania and,113
NA,other small States. It is the protector of the,113
NA,smaU States. It is an institution to which the,113
NA,the States can go if they claim injustice. This,113
NA,"hypocritical Premier, the most ungrateful Prem-",113
NA,"ier in Austraha, claims that he has been short-",113
NA,"changed, but when chaUenged to go to the",113
NA,Grants Commission and ask for the money to be,113
NA,made up he does not answer the challenge. The,113
NA,"fact is that the Grants Commission, through the",113
NA,facilities of the Commonwealth Auditor-,113
NA,"General's Office, would discover the sorts of",113
NA,"I have mentioned; that is, that Mr Netison",113
NA,sat on $41m while unemployment was causing,113
NA,"human misery in our State, that Mr Netison's de-",113
NA,partments did not spend their money and that his,113
NA,"Budget surplus was $8m, and not $ 1.5m. He",113
NA,"and his two Labor colleagues, Mr Wran and the",113
NA,"temporary Premier of South AustraUa, Mr Dun-",113
NA,"stan, are all sitting on Budget surpluses and are",113
NA,to spend the money they are getting as a,113
NA,of result of this Government's federaUsm poUcy.,113
NA,In the few moments remaining to me I would,113
NA,Uke to comment briefly on some of the contribu-,113
NA,tions made in this debate tonight. The honour-,113
NA,able member for Adelaide is a friendly man for,113
NA,"whom I have a personal regard, but he made one",113
NA,of the poorest speeches that I have heard in this,113
NA,"ofHouse on this subject. Then, to our amazement,",113
NA,We when hefinishedhis speech the Deputy Leader,113
NA,of the Opposition ( Mr Uren) came in and gave,113
NA,almost word for word the same speech. It was,113
NA,"Uke an echo. Sitting here, I had the strange feel-",113
NA,that I had heard it before. The voices were,113
NA,"different and the faces were different, but the",113
NA,words were the same. The Opposition moved an,113
NA,Comamendment which is the greatest fraud and,113
NA,charade brought into this House for many years.,113
NA,It claims that this BUl reduces in real terms the,113
NA,he funds avaUable to the States. That is a Ue. It,113
NA,increases the funds avaUable to the States by,113
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The honourable,113
NA,gentleman wtil not characterise the amendment,113
NA,for as a Ue. He wtil withdraw that remark.,113
Mr HODGMAN,I t is not true. Is that,113
NA,"government, the sufficient, Sir?",113
Mr SPEAKER,The honourable gentleman,113
NA,wtil not receive advice from me. I have caUed,113
NA,upon him to withdraw the remark.,113
Mr HODGMAN,Thank you.,113
Mr SPEAKER,The honourable member will,114
NA,withdraw the remark.,114
Mr HODGMAN,I withdraw the remark. ter,114
NA,The claim that the Bill reduces in real terms the cent,114
NA,"funds available to the States is untrue, because $187,000,",114
NA,the Bill increases them by 13.6 per cent. Seccent. So when,114
NA,"ondly, the amendment claims that the Bill will",114
NA,increase the States' borrowing costs. That too is,114
NA,untrue. What it does is relieve the States of debt people,114
NA,charges which they otherwise would have had to people,114
NA,"pay. Thirdly, the amendment claims that the BiU colleagues at anconsider",114
NA,wul force the States to reduce the services they,114
NA,provide-tha t is untrue because the States have,114
NA,"more money, so why should they have to reduce",114
NA,the services?-and/o r wtil force them to impose,114
NA,additional taxes and charges. That is demonfundamentally,114
NA,strably untrue because both the Victorian and,114
NA,Tasmanian governments in their Budgets Labor,114
NA,reduced taxes; they did not increase them.,114
NA,but not least-thi s is the most shabby claim,114
NA,aU-th e amendment asserts that the Bill wtil lead,114
NA,to increased unemployment This is part of the,114
NA,AustraUan Labor Party's disgraceful tactic of,114
NA,using the unemployed as a poUtical footbaU in,114
NA,"1977, just as it did from 1972 to 1975. The",114
NA,amendment is worthless. It is deceitful. It is,114
NA,not worth the paper upon which it is typed.,114
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The honourable to,114
NA,member wtil withdraw the word,114
NA,he used in relation to the amendment. I have today than itTasmania,114
NA,already warned him about using that sort of lan-,114
NA,"guage, and he wtil cease using it",114
Mr HODGMAN,"I f you please, Mr Speaker;",114
NA,I withdraw the word. The amendment is,114
NA,unworthy of an opposition which claims to,114
NA,"genuinely concerned about the unemployed,",114
NA,cause it uses the unemployed as a poUtical footblind,114
NA,baU. That is not the sort of thing I expect from,114
NA,the Opposition.,114
NA,"FinaUy, I wish to take up some points which",114
NA,were raised by the honourable member for,114
NA,Burke ( Mr Keith Johnson). He said that in relagratulate,114
NA,tion to this type of legislation we had to see,114
NA,way in which the money was used. He referred,114
NA,land purchases and went on at some length cannot,114
NA,about a number of land purchases in Victoria.,114
NA,"is fair to say that, where the State has come underwe",114
NA,atack over the way in which it carries out its,114
NA,"purchases, we are entitled at least to query the",114
NA,acquisition by a State instrumentaUty of a propis,114
NA,erty comprising 326 acres at Craigieburn,114
NA,"toria for $908,750 on 30 August 1974, when later",114
NA,the same day the Commonwealth Government,114
NA,"paid the sum of $ 1,485,000 for it. That is",114
NA,cent increase on the one day.,114
NA,Mr Groom-Whe n was that?,114
Mr HODGMAN,"The day, I repeat was 30",114
NA,August 1974.1 do not know who was the Minis-,114
NA,responsible but they are the facts- a 63 per,114
NA,gain in value on the one day. Since the pur-,114
NA,chase originaUy in August 1972 for a mere,114
NA,there has been an mcrease of 700 per,114
NA,people talk about the States not,114
NA,being responsible enough to make purchases,114
NA,with Commonwealth money on behalf of the,114
NA,"should Uving in those States, I feel that those",114
NA,the form of their own,114
NA,earUer time in respect to a pur-,114
NA,"chase of land which on the face of it warrants, at",114
NA,the very least a royal commission of inquiry.,114
NA,"In conclusion, I beUeve that it is absolutely and",114
NA,wrong for the Labor Party to con-,114
NA,"tinue to misrepresent, and in particular for State",114
NA,"Premiers to continue to misrepresent, this",114
NA,Last Government's federaUsm poticy. We have seen,114
NA,of the deceit-no t in this chamber but outside-o f,114
NA,the claim of double taxation. It is a Ue which be-,114
NA,devtiled people in the elections in New South,114
NA,"Wales and, to some extent, bedevtiled the elec-",114
NA,tions in the Northern Territory. The plain fact of,114
NA,the matter is that the States have never had it so,114
NA,just good and the smaUer States have never had it so,114
NA,"good. I am proud, as a member from Tasmania,",114
NA,"say that one thing to which we can point, one",114
NA,"'deceitful' that able, is that of",114
NA,achievement this Government which is irrefut-,114
NA,has been,114
NA,is better off financiaUy,114
NA,since Federation. The,114
NA,E eople of Tasmania are not the least impressed,114
NA,y the specious arguments which come from our,114
NA,coUeagues on the other side ofthe chamber and,114
NA,which wtil come in a few minutes from the,114
NA,be riausible and persuasive honourable member,114
NA,S,114
NA,beor Hughes ( Mr Les Johnson) who will try to,114
NA,the whole debate with science. The facts,114
NA,are indisputable. The Tasmanian State Govern-,114

NA,is how good our federalism policy is. That is why,114
NA,"aU Tasmanians welcome this legislation, con-",114

NA,are talking about the States Grants (Capital,114

Mr HURFORD ,An d with integrity which is a,114

Mr LES JOHNSON,"And with integrity,",114
NA,which is the kind of advocacy I would expect,114
NA,from the honourable member for Adelaide. present,115
NA,"Overall, funds for the States have",115
NA,by 9 per cent which is a reduction of about,115
NA,"cent in real terms. Even these figures, however,",115
NA,"are dubious. Last year, actual expenditure on",115
NA,specific purpose grants was $l25m less than thesuch figure,115
NA,figure announced in the Budget. Although the Minster,115
NA,general purpose revenue funds have been in relation tofor,115
NA,"mcreased, funds for specific purposes have beenhold a 2 per education, cent",115
NA,cut by 8 per cent in real terms and funds for capifulfilled.,115
NA,tal purposes have been reduced by 12 per cent inis,115
NA,real terms. A decline of 12 per cent in capital ation,115
NA,funds means extra unemployment. It means a cuts concerns,115
NA,downturn in the building industry and a major ings which is expendituredown,115
NA,"slowing up of construction of schools,",115
NA,hospitals and the like. I do not think there is anyper cent in real terms. Urban pubUcaretranspon,115
NA,dispute about that. If there is a decline of 12 per,115
NA,cent for these purposes there is bound to be a del-spending,115
NA,eterious effect of the type about,115
NA,talked.,115
NA,We are discussing funds which are made,115
NA,able by the Federal Government to the States.,115
NA,That is not a pohtical contention; it happens,115
NA,"be a factual contention. As I will show, it is",115
NA,kind of belief which is totally shared by the,115
NA,Premiers. After suffering reductions for two,115
NA,"years, the States must soon be forced to increaseSouth",115
NA,taxes and charges or-,115
NA,Mr Groom-Wha t about services?,115
Mr LES JOHNSON,I was just going to,115
NA,mention services. I am saying that in the situation,115
NA,where States suffer reductions over two years,115
NA,they have the option of increasing taxes and,115
NA,charges or-,115
NA,Mr Groom-Wh y could they not spend the,115
NA,money?,115
Mr LES JOHNSON,The honourable mem-,115
NA,ber for Braddon has asked a question. I am giv-The,115
NA,ing the answer. The Government has two great,115
NA,options. It can increase taxes and charges or,115
NA,vices will be cut. Both these things are happeningthe,115
NA,in the total State situation. So the federalism,115
NA,icy is likely to collapse. The collapse can come,115
NA,about for the foUowing reasons: Last year,115
NA,States expected to get an extra $90m under the,115
NA,tax sharing arrangements to balance cuts in,115
NA,specific purpose grants. As it turned out the,115
NA,disappeared andfiveStates have to rely on a,115
NA,guarantee to keep with the old formula. As a 20,115
NA,result the formula for tax sharing has been aban-be,115
NA,doned. There is now a dispute between the Com-eUgible.,115
NA,monwealth and the States over the new formula.the,115
NA,I do not think there is any disputation about that.per,115
NA,Any State Premier wtil teU honourable membersof,115
NA,about that disputation which is in progress at,115
NA,"time. If that dispute is not resolved, fed-",115
NA,been increasederaUsm is finished.,115
NA,2 per The major cuts in specific purpose funds,115
NA,include cuts in real terms for major programs,115
NA,as education and roads. I cannot recall the,115
NA,for roads offhand. It is acknowledged by,115
NA,Education (Senator Carrick) that,115
NA,growtn,115
NA,the undertaking to up-,115
NA,factor has not yet been,115
NA,"That being the case, with inflation there",115
NA,a cut in real terms in education. A simUar situ-,115
NA,prevails in regard to roads. Another area of,115
NA,18 per,115
NA,on pensioner dweU-,115
NA,cent in real terms.,115
NA,"roads, Funds for Aboriginal advancement",115
NA,down 16,115
NA,has been cut by 25 per cent. Funds for,115
NA,"which I have $800,000. Fundshave",115
NA,national parks been reduced by $2m to,115
NA,for leisure facUities have been,115
NA,dropped by 60 per cent in real terms. As every,115
NA,"avail-honourable member knows, urban programs",115
NA,"have virtually disappeared. These, of course,",115
NA,to include funds for sewerage which formerly were,115
NA,the in the vicinity of $100m and land development,115
NA,Stategrowth centres which were formerly over $100m.,115
NA,Of course the States are concerned. In the New,115
NA,Wales ParUament on 17 August an ur-,115
NA,gency motion was moved in these terms.,115
NA,That this House expresses its concern that the Federal,115
NA,Budget delivered last night:,115
NA,(a) Ensures no reduction in unemployment for another,115
NA,"year,",115
NA,(b) Cuts back funding for primary producers;,115

NA,"centres, legal aid, school dental schemes, growth",115
NA,"centres, sewerage and other programs;",115
NA,(d) Is not conducive to a return of confidence for the,115
NA,privat sector.,115
NA,"Premier, speaking on this matter, expressed",115
NA,concern about the unemployment situation,115
NA,ser-and the phght of primary producers. The fact of,115
NA,matter is that unemployment is getting very,115
NA,pol-serious and the Premiers have passed resolutions,115
NA,expressing their concern at this matter. They pre-,115
NA,"the dict that unemployment wtil top the 400,000",115
NA,mark by Christmas this year. The fact is this: The,115
NA,only concession in the Budget to unemployment,115
NA,$90mis a sUght extension of the youth unemployment,115
NA,scheme. Age of eUgibUity is to be increased from,115
NA,to 25 years. But young people wtil sttil have to,115

NA,Total expenditure on unemployment in,115
NA,Federal Budget is less than $40m or 0.0004,115

NA,this unemployment scheme is less than the,115
NA,the$60m the Commonwealth wtil save by its sinister,115
NA,proposal to pay unemployment benefits in,116
NA,arrears.,116
NA,There was a Premiers meeting. This is the that,116
NA,point I was making in respect of the contribution over area,116
NA,made by the honourable member for Denison buUding and construction,116
NA,( Mr Hodgman). He was virtually saying,116
NA,"States had been overindulged, that they had in",116
NA,been given more than they could spend,116
NA,ters of that kind. The Premiers met on 5 August ing,116
NA,and issued a statement of three paragraphs. I,116
NA,shall quote it because I think it is relevant to the AustraUan,116
NA,argument. It reads:,116
NA,The Premiers today met in Melbourne,116
NA,overall economic situadon,116
NA,"review, they urged an immediate stimulus to the economy",116
NA,through a balanced series of measures designed to,116
NA,"employment, without abandoning the task of getting infla-",116
NA,tion under control.,116
NA,It is the unanimous view of,116
NA,must be reduced as a tangible contribution towards,116
NA,economic recovery and to assist in restoring confidence,116
NA,public and private sectors.,116
NA,The money market and the public are geared to a,116
NA,tion in rates and the Premiers are firmly of the view,116
NA,there should be an early and significant reduction,116
NA,of the prediction given by the Treasurer at the last,116
NA,Conference that interest rates would be reduced this year.,116
NA,Mr Bourchier-Thi s year is not yet over.,116
Mr LES JOHNSON,The honourable mposition,116
NA,gendeman is interjecting. I do not know whether,116
NA,he disagrees with the sentiments I have just,116
NA,outlined. He may not have been listening very,116
NA,carefully so I remind him that the sentiments are,116
NA,not mine; they are the sentiments of the Prema,116
NA,"iers, unanimously subscribed to. Premier Hamer",116
NA,of Victoria is just as enthusiastic about this,116
NA,Premier Wran of New South Wales. Even Premclaims,116
NA,ier Bjelke-Petersen-,116
NA,Mr Kevin Cairns-The y made no effort,116
NA,reduce their interest rates when they had the,116
NA,power.,116
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The honourable omy.,116
NA,member for Hughes will resume his seat. I point,116
NA,out to honourable members that,116
NA,speaker in this debate and I think we should,116
NA,him in silence and without interjection.,116
Mr LES JOHNSON,"Thank you, Mr have",116
NA,Speaker. I will not labour this point. It is,116
NA,Premiers statement and I think it is very imporespeciaUy,116
NA,tant. The Federal Budget did not contain one,116
NA,indication that interest rates would be reduced,116
NA,that AustraUans would have access to funds,116
NA,get the buUding and construction industry going.,116
NA,"To that extent, from the standpoint of all Premment",116
NA,"iers, Liberal and Labor aUke, there is a very",116
NA,serious omission in the Government's economic,116
NA,"strategy. In other words, the Commonwealth",116
NA,ignored this unanimous caU by the State Prem-,116
NA,iers for measures to stimulate the economy. For,116
NA,"example, look at the manufacturing industry. In",116
NA,the,116
NA,"employment feU by another 41,000",116
NA,"past year or by 3.4 per cent, and in the",116
NA,industry employment,116
NA,that the AustraUa in the past year,116
NA,"12,000 or by 3 per cent.",116
NA,feU by another,116
NA,AustraUan manufactur-,116
NA,and matcapacity utilisation is worsening. On,116
NA,the latest,116
NA,"below 80 per cent. According to the latestitfigures,",116
NA,figures which were pubhshed in March was,116
NA,private investment was down 3.7 per,116
NA,cent in real terms on last year'sfigureswhich,116
NA,and discussed the were also issued in March.,116
NA,in Australia. As a result of this,116
NA,There is this argument as to whether it is,116
NA,expand desirable to expand the level of pubUc spending.,116
NA,It so happens that AustraUa's performance in,116
NA,the Premiers that interest rates,116
NA,this regard is not good by comparison with corn-,116
NA,"overall arable countries. For example, in the United",116
NA,5,116
NA,in the fates current pubUc expenditure on goods and,116
NA,services is 18.8 per cent; in Canada it is 19.2 per,116
NA,reduccent; in Germany it is 19.7 percent; in the United,116
NA,that Kingdom it is 20.5 per cent and in Sweden it is,116
NA,in the light23.6 per cent. In AustraUa the level of pubUc,116
NA,Premiers expenditure-th e proportion of gross domestic,116
NA,product that goes to things public-i s 15.4 per,116
NA,cent. Is not there a good case to put against the,116
NA,I,116
NA,that we should hft expenditure to a,116
NA,evei comparable to that of other countries? It,116
NA,seems to me that there is. Let me just give the,116
NA,House a quick illustration. Several countries have,116
NA,increased expenditure over the last two years. As,116
NA,"result, unemployment has decreased. In the",116
NA,United States unemployment has decreased by 3,116
NA,as per cent and the government of that country,116
NA,that it is because of the stimulus given,116
NA,through the public sector of the economy. In,116
NA,Germany there has been a decrease in unem-,116
NA,to ployment of 1 per cent. It is not a massive,116
NA,amount but it is a decrease and it is attributed to,116
NA,this stimulation of the pubhc sector of the econ-,116
NA,"Japan, I think, is in a similar position to",116
NA,Germany. I think there must be a lot of new,116
NA,this is the last thinking here.,116
NA,hear The State Premiers have made other state-,116
NA,"ments which, iftimepermitted, I would quote. I",116
NA,already mentioned some ofthe matters that,116
NA,the are affected by the Budget provisions and,116
NA,by the provisions affecting money for,116
NA,the States. Let me mention one or two others. As,116
NA,"so a previous speaker said, local government is a",116
NA,to topic which members could be tempted to get,116
NA,stuck into tonight because of the local govern-,116
NA,elections occurring in New South Wales on,116
NA,Saturday. Local government expenditure has,116
NA,been cut by 5 per cent in real terms. We know,116
NA,has about thefiddle.There is an increase in the,116
NA,amount of direct expenditure. We know there,117
NA,has been a very wide range of decreases in,117
NA,respect of indirect expenditure. I do not,117
NA,time to enunciate the details of that.,117
NA,"to the housing area, total expenditure-thi",117
NA,tainly a Sute matter-i s down 30 per cent in real,117
NA,terms over the last two years. Total housing Budget,117
NA,"expenditure this year has been cut by $53m, a",117
NA,"Budget fact. The area of pre-schools,",117
NA,"State matter, has had a cut in funds of $6m.",117
NA,Commonwealth is paying only 49 per cent of,117
NA,salaries in the pre-school area,117
NA,per cent last year and 75 per cent in the,117
NA,"year. The school dental scheme, just another",117
NA,"casualty, is down by only $0.8m, but it is down my point.",117
NA,instead of being up. In real terms the cut is much,117
NA,larger than $0.8m. I refer next to Aboriginal,117
NA,health. Fancy Aboriginal health being a victim,117
NA,any situation. It has been cut by $ 1 m. The,117
NA,ter for Aboriginal Affairs ( Mr Viner) will,117
NA,knowledge the truth of what I am saying. We,117
NA,have heard a lot about the sewerage program. It,117
NA,would be inappropriate to say that I do not want,117
NA,to dwell on this matter but the fact is that the,117
NA,Commonwealth spent $259m on sewerage up to,117
NA,1976-77. Last year it was pruned to $50m. This,117
NA,year it has been abolished altogether. Certainly,117
NA,the States are justifiably concerned about that,117
NA,savage curtailment,117
NA,In this debate I was preceded on this side,117
NA,"the House by my colleague, the honourable the",117
NA,member for Sydney ( Mr Les MCMahon). Does,117
NA,he not have justification to talk about the cuts,117
NA,33.3 per cent in the Glebe program? Does he not,117
NA,have justification to complain about the cuts,117
NA,60 per cent in the Woolloomooloo program? I,117
NA,"come next to youth, sport and recreation. That is",117
NA,down by $3m. Every honourable member must,117
NA,be concerned about that This,117
NA,national parks and the adrninistration expenses,117
NA,of the Heritage Commission. There has been,117
NA,"$3m cut in the area of youth, sport",117
NA,recreation.,117
Mr SPEAKER,Order! I suggest that the,117
NA,honourable gentleman return to,117
NA,ter ofthe Bill.,117
Mr LES JOHNSON,"Thank you, Mr",117
NA,Speaker. I have been endeavouring,117
NA,curtailments in areas of expenditure affecting,117
NA,State administrationfinancedby the Federal mending,117
NA,Government It would seem to me that the mat-,117
NA,ters to which I have referred appropriately fit,117
NA,into that category. In consideration of the late-,117
NA,"ness ofthe hour, I will refer",117
NA,"That, of course, is the question of the environ-",117
NA,ment That affects almost every major State,117
NA,works program. One of the cuts is in expenditure,117
NA,on pubhc hearings in respect of environmental,117
NA,impact statements. A very important democratic,117
NA,have process affecting every State pubhc works.,117
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The honourable,117
NA,s is cergentleman is talking about Commonwealth,117
NA,cuts. We are debating a Bill about States,117
NA,grants.,117
Mr LES JOHNSON,I do not want to,117
NA,"The quibble, Mr Speaker. I think I have made my",117
NA,point concerning that 88 per cent. That is all I,117
NA,compared with 73 wanted to say.,117
Mr SPEAKER,Just as long as the honour-,117
NA,able gentleman understands that I have made,117
Mr LES JOHNSON,"Indeed I do, Mr",117
NA,"in Speaker, and I have no intention of quibbling",117
NA,Minis-about this matter. From what I have said no,117
NA,achonourable member can have any doubt that the,117
NA,States have been given a raw deal. The State,117
NA,Premiers have expressed their concern. I believe,117
NA,that in the very near future as elections occur at,117
NA,various levels around this country-no t just local,117
NA,"government elections but, for example, the South",117
NA,Australian State election-peopl e in the com-,117
NA,munity who are starting to feel the accumulated,117
NA,effect of this Government's ill-advised pohcies,117
NA,will react. The substantial effect is that private,117
NA,"expenditure can go any way its wants, but the",117
NA,of casualty has to be the pubhc area. I believe that,117
NA,pubhc will react The chickens will be coming,117
NA,home to roost very very soon. I am glad that,117
NA,of honourable members are being given an oppor-,117
NA,tunity to speak very fully in this debate. I hope,117
NA,of that the other members of the Opposition who,117
NA,are prepared to speak will be given the oppor-,117
NA,tunity to do so. I appreciate the opportunity that I,117
NA,have had to reveal these important facts to the,117
NA,"concerns wildlife, House tonight.",117

NA,Motion (by Mr Viner) proposed:,118
NA,That the House do now adjourn.,118
Mr BRYANT ,Wills) (11.44)- I want to men-,118
NA,tion briefly the way in which the House is being,118
NA,managed and the difficulties that we will get into,118
NA,if we take these steps of departing from the 10.30,118
NA,p.m. adjournment and the 11 p.m. rule. I have,118
NA,"been a member of this House for a long while, as",118
NA,"has the Government Whip, although he has not",118
NA,been a member for quite as long as I have. I think,118
NA,that we should resist these departures from nor-,118
NA,mal practice in the Parhament. This is the second,118
NA,time in a couple of weeks on which this has,118
NA,occurred. It wtil not be long before we will be,118
NA,"back to the situation of sitting until 3 a.m., which",118
NA,caused great dissatisfaction amongst and great,118
NA,inconvenience to members of parliament. I nope,118
NA,there will be no repetition of this practice.,118
Mr BIRNEY ,Phillip) (11.45)-An incident,118
NA,occurred in Broken Hill this week that almost,118
NA,went unnoticed. It has now been called the,118
NA,Latham affair. It concerns the present Adminis-,118
NA,"trator and his stooge, the Town Clerk, as well as",118
NA,"Noel Latham, who honourable members will re-",118
NA,call is the courageous trade unionist who dared,118
NA,to challenge the might and despotism of the Bar-,118
NA,rier Industrial Council. After fighting legal bat-,118
NA,tles before the Federal Court of Australia and in,118
NA,jurisdictions of the Supreme Court of New South,118
NA,Wales the matter was finally resolved by way of,118
NA,"a settlement. (Quorum formed). As I was saying,",118
NA,the incident concerns the present Adrninistrator,118
NA,"and his stooge, the Town Clerk, as well as Noel",118
NA,"Latham, who honourable members will recall is",118
NA,the courageous trade unionist who dared to chal-,118
NA,lenge the might and despotism of the Barrier,118
NA,Industrial Council. After fighting legal battles,118
NA,before the Federal Court of Australia and in jur-,118
NA,isdictions of the Supreme Court of New South,118
NA,Wales the matter was finally resolved by way of,118
NA,a settlement which effectively restored Latham's,118
NA,membership of the Amalgamated Metal,118
NA,ap- Workers and Shipwrights Union. With the con-,118
NA,currence of the Broken Hill City Council he was,118
NA,reinstated in his job as a leading hand mechanic,118
NA,"However, after he reported for work, some 90",118
NA,individuals walked off the job. Despite a meeting,118
NA,called this week by the Barrier Industrial Council,118
NA,"the 90 members present, being respectively",118
NA,"members of the Town Employees Union, the",118
NA,Municipal Employees Union and the Building,118
NA,"Trades Union, decided to have their own meet-",118
NA,ing at which a resolution was passed supporting,118
NA,the right of any individual to exercise his dis-,118
NA,cretion as to whether he should work with any,118
NA,particular person. This resolution was obviously,118
NA,a sham and a fraud and was directed at pres-,118
NA,surising the Broken Hill City Council once more,118
NA,into dismissing Latham.,118
NA,The Administrator and the Town Clerk,118
NA,usurped the functions of their office and acted,118
NA,contrary to all democratic principles when they,118
NA,carpeted Latham at the Council Chambers and,118
NA,put pressure on him to resign on the basis that if,118
NA,he did so voluntarily the Council would pay him,118
NA,full compensation. Let me tell those men now in,118
NA,case they already do not know that their powers,118
NA,flow only from the provisions of the Local,118
NA,"Government Act, which would never counten-",118
NA,ance their despicable behaviour in their miser-,118
NA,able attempts to erode the democraticrightsof,118
NA,this individual. They are the same democratic,118
NA,"rights as thousands of AustraUans went away for,",118
NA,fought for and died for. Their actions have hor-,118
NA,rified me and I am sure will disgust all those who,118
NA,beUeve not only in the rule of law but also in an,118
NA,individual's right to work without harassment,118
NA,and intimidation. I suggest that they both resign.,118
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The honourable,118

NA,Mr Lynch-Th e answer to the honourable,134
NA,member's question is as follows:,134
NA,(1) to (5 ) The Government is pursuing this matter with all,134
NA,possible expedition. A number or important,134
NA,"nical questions are, of course, involved which will need",134

NA,Mr Garrick asked the Minister representing 20(22),134
NA,"the Minister for Education, upon notice, on 25 on the",134
NA,August 1977.,134
NA,(1) Do the Government's spending decisions on education,134
NA,announced on 3 June 1977 effectively involve the,134
NA,about $ 13 m from government schools to private schools.,134
NA,(2) Did the announcement indicate that real growth in,134
NA,education at both school and university level was actually,134
NA,cut.,134
NA,(3) Will 1978 be the start of a major slow-down in edu-,134
NA,cation outlays.,134
NA,(4) Are the guidelines for 1979 and 1980 a true represen-,134
NA,tation of the Government's intentions.,134
NA,"(5) If so, why were the",134
NA,not adhered to in accordance with this consistency.,134
NA,(6) Was the Government's decision to reallocate money,134
NA,from public to private schools based on any recommenda-,134
NA,tions by the Schools Commission.,134
NA,(7) Was this decision taken on political grounds and,134
NA,for education reasons.,134
NA,(8) Was the original function of the Schools Commission,134
NA,to be an independent arbiter deciding where funds should,134
NA,directed.,134

NA,direct instructions on overallfinancialguidelines in considerhelp,134
NA,able detail throw a new light on the independence of the,134
NA,Commission.,134
NA,(10) Will the new guidelines mean that in an immediate,134
NA,sense it is harder for students to gain access to universities,134
NA,and colleges.,134
NA,(11) Will most tertiary institutions have to slash their,134
NA,budgets and retrench some of their staff.,134

NA,"Government Teachers Colleges, will Colleges of Advanced",134
NA,Education have the same funds in 1978 as they did in,134
NA,if one takes into account the price rises factor.,134
NA,(15) Did the last report of the Australian Universities,134
NA,Commission state that the guidelines for the 1977-79 trien-,134
NA,nium specify a minimum growth in expenditure,134
NA,ond and third years of the triennium (2 per cent) and that,134
NA,"unless this is a guaranteed minimum rate of growth,",134
NA,ward planning will not be possible and the arrangements,134
NA,will not constitute a triennial system.,134
NA,"(16) If so, does the faa that the Government has changed",134
NA,its mind now mean that triennial funding no longer exists.,134
NA,(17) Does it also mean that funds will now betighterin,134

NA,(25) Will the cut-backs from original estimates render,134

NA,(35) If the Government does not have any plans to make a,134
NA,"for the secpolicy statement, what is the reason.",134
such for Mr VINER ,Th e Minister for Education has,134
NA,provided the following answer to the honourable,134
NA,member's question:,134
NA,(1H35) It will be recalled that the previous Government,135
NA,in 1975 reduced the total level,135
NA,"cation Commissions' programs for 1976. By contrast, this",135
NA,Government adopted levels of expenditure for 1977 which,135
NA,restoredrealgrowth to the education programs. Funds,135
NA,colleges of advanced education,135
NA,"by 5 per cent, for TAFE by IVi",135
NA,and schools by 2 per cent,135
NA,In times of major inflationary pressures no government,135
NA,can sustain fixed triennial planning because of the imposcommenting,135
NA,sibility of making large fixed commitments three years,135
NA,"ahead. Accordingly, the Fraser Government has introduced",135
NA,the principle of the rolling triennium with indicative planive,135
NA,ning guidelines to enable planning to be made against,135
NA,prospect of increased national capacity.,135
NA,The guidelines for 1978 envisaged indicative planning have,135
NA,"r >als or2 per cent for universities,",135
NA,per cent for TAFE. In the light ofthe need for the mainten-,135
NA,ance of economic restraints the Government has not been,135
NA,able to provide for 2 per cent growth,135
NA,"has, however, essentially consolidated them upon the base",135
NA,growth levels achieved rn 1977 and has provided a 10 per,135
NA,cent increase for TAFE.,135
NA,The Government recognises that the slowing down of,135
NA,growth in universities and colleges of advanced education in,135
NA,1978 may lead to some re-adjustments. Nevertheless as far,135
NA,as staff are concerned the wages and salaries component,135
NA,recurrent expenditure will receive full cost supplementation.,135
NA,Such costs represent by far the major part of education,135
NA,expenditure. Although capital funds will not be not(3)true,135
NA,"supplemented in 1978, tender prices are proving to be far on any visit",135
NA,more stable in recent times.,135
NA,Concerning the Government's position on grants to,135
NA,"schools, I refer the honourable member to my statement",135
NA,"made in the Senate on 8 September 1977, when I tabled the",135
NA,Schools Commission Report for 1978.,135

NA,later date.,135
NA,"(2) If so, is the legislation to be introduced during the",135

NA,of certain problems inherent in establishing legislation for,135
NA,the Board. The issues warrant further investigation. As,135
NA,announced in my policy statement of 1 April 1976 the Board,135

NA,(1) Does the Conciliation and Arbitration Act or its day,136
NA,Regulations make any provision that requires that the rules tion-that,136
NA,of a registered organisation shall give its members ample prescribed,136
NA,notice of the opening and closing date for nominations for not,136
NA,official positions.,136
NA,"(2) If not, is it the practice of the Registrar to refuse to",136
NA,register rules which faU to provide for suitable public notice,136
NA,"of the opening and closing dates of nominations, particulars",136
NA,or offices to be filled and ample time within which a candimade,136
NA,date may nominate for office.,136
NA,Mr Street-Th e answer to the honourable encountered,136
NA,member's question is as follows:,136
NA,(1) Section 133 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act,136
NA,requires that the rules ofa registered organisation shall pro-,136
NA,"vide for the manner in which persons may become candidesirable,",136
NA,dates for election. Neither the Act nor the regulations,136
NA,specifically require that the rules give members nouce,136
NA,"opening and closing date for nominations. However, section",136
NA,140 of the Act provides that the rules,136
NA,"members conditions, obligations or restrictions which,",136
NA,having regard to the objects of the Act and the purposes,136
NA,"registration under the Aa, are oppressive, unreasonable",136
NA,unjust.,136
NA,(2) Compliance with the Conciliation,136
NA,and the prescribed conditions set out in the Conciliation and,136
NA,Arbitration Regulations is a precondition toregistrationas,136
NA,an organisation. Regulation 115(i) is to the effect that,136
NA,of the rules of the applicant association'. . . shall be a,136
NA,"which, if the association were registered, would contravene",136
NA,sub-section(l) of section 140 of tne Aa'.,136
NA,The operation of alterations to certain rules of an,136
NA,"ationrequiresthe certification by the Registrar that, in his",136
NA,"opinion, the alteration complies with and is not contrary",136
NA,"the provisions of the Aa, of theregulationsor of an award",136
NA,and is not otherwise contrary to law.,136
NA,Whether a provision of the rules of an organisation,136
NA,complies with therequirements of section 140 is a matter for,136
NA,the opinion ofthe Industrial Registrar.,136

Mr CLYDE CAMERON , the Minister for There,136
NA,"Employment and Industrial Relations, upon requirements",136
NA,"nouce, on 9 March 1977:",136
NA,(1) What is thereasonfor the alteration made to sub-,136
NA,regulations (2) and (3) of Regulation 139 of the Conciliation,136
NA,and Arbitration Regulations.,136
NA,(2) In what way does the newregulationaffea persons,136
NA,belonging to an organisation whose rules stipulate no open-,136
NA,"ing and closing date for nominations, but allows its manage-",136
NA,ment committee to summarily fix such dates without nouce,136
NA,or publication.,136
NA,(3) How can the practical application of this Regulation,136
NA,be reconciled with the provision of Regulation 146AD,136
NA,except by keeping nominations open for at least 2 months.,136
NA,Mr Street-Th e answer to the honourable,136
NA,member's question is as follows:,136
NA,(1) Regulation 139 of the Conciliation and Arbitration,136
NA,"(Question No. 97) Regulations, as amended by Statutory Rules 1976 No. 187,",136
NA,a request by an organisation or a branch of an,136
NA,section 170 (1) of the Concilation and,136
NA,Aa for the condua of an election shall be made,136
NA,not less than 2 months or more than 6 months before the last,136
NA,on which persons may become candidates at the elec-,136
NA,"is, the closing date of nominations. Formerly, the",136
NA,period was a period not less than one month and,136
NA,more than three months before the closing date of,136
NA,nominations.,136
NA,The amendment of regulation 139 was inresponseto,136
NA,difficulties experienced in the operation ofthe former regula-,136
NA,"tion. I am advised that, in many instances,requestswere not",136
NA,until the period prescribed by regulation 139 (2) had,136
NA,almost expired and that as a consequence the Industrial,136
NA,Registrar and the Chief Australian Electoral Officer at times,136
NA,"serious difficulties in the condua ofthe election,",136
NA,"requiring, for example, the postponement of certain steps in",136
NA,the elecuon.,136
NA,I am also advised that experience had shown that it was,136
NA,in order toreducethe likelihood ofrequestsbeing,136
NA,"made out of time, to enlarge the time for making requests by",136
NA,of the extending the maximum period during which they may be,136
NA,made from 3 months to 6 months before the closing date of,136
NA,shall not impose upon nominations.,136
NA,Resolution of these difficulties has been effected by,136
NA,of increasing the maximumtimeprescribed for the making ofa,136
NA,or request to 6 months before the closing date of nominations,136
NA,and having the time for making requests expire 2 months be-,136
NA,and Arbitration Aa fore that date.,136
NA,"(2) Under the amended Regulation, the Registrar retains",136
NA,his discretion under regulation 139 (3) to accept a request,136
NA,none made less than 2 months before the dosing date of nomi-,136
NA,rule nations. The type of situation to which the honourable mem-,136
NA,ber has adverted appears to be covered by the existence of,136
NA,"this discretion in the Registrar. Furthermore, the Govern-",136
NA,organisment has also promulgatedregulations(Statutory Rules,136
NA,1977 No. 33) which require industrial organisations to notify,136
NA,to by 1 September in each year information as to the dates of,136
NA,nominations for elections due in the forthcoming 12 month,136
NA,period. Theregulationsalso require the publication of this,136
NA,information by the Industrial Registrar. Members of organis-,136
NA,ations will thus have an opportunity to decide whether to,136
NA,"request an election under section 170, and be able to do so",136
NA,well within the prescribedtimelimits.,136
NA,(3) I have already described the effea of regulation 139.,136
NA,"Regulation 146AD, which applies to elections conducted",136
NA,"under the secret postal ballots regulations, prescribes that the",136
NA,"Organisations Returning Officer shall, within 21 days before the opening of",136
NA,"(Question No. 98) nominations, publish in a newspaper certain particulars con-",136
NA,cerning the lodging of nominations.,136
NA,is no conflia between these tworegulations.The,136
NA,ofregulation139 are founded upon the closing,136
NA,"date of nominations, those ofregulation146AD upon the",136
NA,"opening date of nominations. In practice, in tbe case of an",137
NA,organisation conducting an election in accordance with the,137
NA,"secret postal ballot regulations, and requesting the conduct",137
NA,"of that election under section 170 (i), the requirements ofthe",137
NA,"Regulations would apply without conflict. For example,",137
NA,where the rules of an organisation required nominations to,137
NA,"remain open for one month, a request under section 170 (i)",137
NA,"would, in accordance with regulation 139, be required to be",137
NA,made at least two months before the closing date of nomi-,137
NA,nations and thus would precede the opening date of nomi-,137
NA,nations by one month. That request would precede by one,137
NA,"week the notification in accordance with regulation 146AD,",137
NA,"that is, 21 days before the opening date of nominations. It is",137
NA,"not, therefore, aresultof the combination ofregulations139",137
NA,and 146AD that nominations must remain open for a period,137
NA,"of 2 months, or that they may berequiredto remain open for",137
NA,a longer period than specified by the rules of an organisation.,137

That those pensioners who have only their pension very little else to Uve on and are forced to pay high rents, in many cases living in extreme poverty. The foregoing facts impel your pedtioners tralian Government as a matter of urgency to: (1) Make sure that subsidies paid to private nursing homes are such that each pensioner Health Benefit Card will pay the private nursing home no more than the statutory minimum padent contribution, which will allow $6 per week to be retained by the pensioner patient for their personal use.

Whitlam-I ask the Minister for National Resources a question which arises from the debate on water projects which he missed yesterday. The question especially concerns the SpeakerBurdekin Project Committee's report in June which stated that the choice between the Burdekin Falls and the Urannah dam sites to meet projected water requirements for agriculture, mdustry and urban supplies in the Burdekin ley and Townsville region, revolved around the future role of hydro-power generation Queensland electricity supply network. I ask: Have the Australian Government and the the Mr Queensland Government yet discussed this basic he brings upon himself. question, as the Committee described it? If so, with what result? If the Governments have not discussed it, when will they do so in view of the that. critical water requirements established by the Committee? Mr Speaker, I am also told that thewithdraw. Committee's report has not been tabled in the Parliament. I ask why that has not happened.",14
2,Mr ANTHONY,"I am deUghted that the Leader of the Opposition has this new-found withdraw. interest in water resources. After the performance of his Government of slowly eliminating national program of water resources starting tofindthat such a program has certain electoral merits. Obviously he is trying to reachonourable tivate some credibility in Queensland an interest in water matters. However, the proposals mentioned by the honourable gendeman were included in a long list of proposals that withdraw. were given to him when in government by the Queensland Government. Of course at that timetion the Labor Government did notfindit appropribe ate to provide funds for these schemes. These matters, along with many other water proposals around Australia, are now being examined by my Department. It is the intention of the Government to come forward with a national water resources policy. I hope that I can make a statement on this matter during the course of this ParUament. GIFT FROM THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA",16
3,Mr WENTWORTH,"Mr Speaker, my question is directed to you. I refer to the magnificent tapestry picture, the recent gift from the delegates of the People's RepubUc of China to this ParUament. I ask you, Sir: If and when this picture is hung in the House, will you have put under it the appropriate inscription 'Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes', wbich means, 'I fear the Chicoms even when they bring gifts'? While a picture may not present the same physical opportunities concealment as does a wooden it not be prudent, metaphorically speaking, to look behind the picture? Since apparently I am cast in the role of Laocoon in this matter, will you use your authority as",16
4,Mr SPEAKER,Order! The honourable member allegedly is asking a question. I ask him to come to the pomt ofhis question.,16
5,Mr WENTWORTH,I ask: Will you use your authority as Speaker to protect me from the train the ditional consequences? SPEAKER-I am afraid I cannot protect honourable member from the consequences I willMONICA,16
6,Mr WENTWORTH ,I thought it would be Uke,16
7,Mr SPEAKER,The honourable member will,16
8,Mr WENTWORTH ,I did not think it would be Uke that.,16
9,Mr SPEAKER,The honourable member will,16
10,a Mr WENTWORTH ,"Yes , I do. I said I did not he is now think it would be Uke that.",16
11,Mr SPEAKER,For thefinaltime I ask the member to withdraw otherwise I will by takingdeal with him immediately.,16
12,Mr WENTWORTH ,"Sir , I have withdrawn. I do",16
13,Mr SPEAKER,"I will make inquiries in relato the tapestry to see where it might properly presented. I would Uke to say on behalf of all members of this chamber, and I am sure on behalf of the Senate, that the sentiments expressed in the question by the honourable member for Mackellar are not shared by the rest of the bers of the ParUament. AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY: DEVALUATION",16
14,Mr UREN,"I direct my quesdon to the Prime Minister. FoUowing the HVi per cent devaluation decision in November of last year the Prime Minister said on the Australian Broadcasting Commission program AM of 30 November. Is there a man here who would say they would sooner Australia into hock to the tune of $ 1,000m rather devalue because that was the official advisers. I ask: Is the current attempt by the Government to borrow more than $600m overseas an indicacedures tion of a complete reversal of the poUcies implemented at the time of the November devaluation?",17
15,Mr SPEAKER,Order! The honourable reasons gendeman will now ask his question.,17
16,Mr UREN,"Mr Speaker, I have to preface the question.",17
17,Mr SPEAKER,The honourable gendeman has taken far too much time prefacing the question.,17
18,Mr UREN,"What conditions now exist that did not exist to justify the pohcy that was given last November? Can such a pohcy reversal cause uncertainty and speculation, as shown by the of $350m in the international reserves in August alone?",17
19,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,"As honourable Medical gentlemen know, the action that was taken which towards the end of last year by the Government placed the rate on a proper basis with a differentany management structure, and that alters the cumstances to a very considerable extent. The present Opposidon is remarkable. It is remarkagive ble for a number of things, not least for its utter irresponsibility in this matter. Time after after time, members of the Opposition quite deUberately have taken actions and said things pubhc designed to create uncertainty, designed to cause difficulty and designed to cause specuengage lation. The Australian pubhc is awake-up to them. MEDICAL BENEFITS PAYMENTS FOR ABORTIONS",17
20,Mr FALCONER,My question is directed to the Minister for Health. I remind him of the significance of item 6469 in the Medical Benefits Schedule which enables payment to be made for abortions. Is he aware of the very real conscienmemtious objection that many people have to contributing towards payment for abortions through health funds? Can he say whether he has taken any action to resolve this situation and to provide relief for the people concerned?,17
21,Mr HUNT,"The Health Insurance Act provides for medical benefits to be paid for services rendered by legally qualified medical practitioners. A number of services attracting benefits are listed in the Medical Benefits Schedule, and put four of them result in the termination of pregthan nancy. I have had many representations, in fact I alternative offered to us by our have had thousands of representations, from people throughout the community, objecting to being party to paying benefits for such prounless the mother has had an abortion because of the state of her health. As a consequence I have had examinations made to see whether it is feasible to try to determine the why abortions are carried out. This does raise some very serious problems relating to the privacy of the individual. It does raise some very difficult problems for my Department and for the various health insurance funds. I would not Uke to see a situation develop in which people had to declare, for one reason or another, why a medical service was provided. However, I have asked my Department to examine the whole area to ascertain whether there are ways and means of ensuring that benefits are loss payable only to mothers who have had an abortion on proper medical grounds. I also have asked my Department to refer this matter to the Benefits Schedule Revision Committee, is a professional body charged with the responsibility of recommending to the Minister changes that should be made to the existing cirMedical Benefits Schedule. I expect a report from that Committee in the very near future. I the honourable member an assurance that I am concerned about this matter. I know that certime tain members of the Government also are concerned about it. However, there are also people in in the community who would not Uke to see my Department or the health insurance funds in a witch hunt to ascertain why abortions were carried out. There could well be a way to get through this difficult problem, and I hope that we willfindit. SPECIAL YOUTH EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PROGRAM",17
22,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,"My question, which is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, concerns his announcement on 17 August that the Special Youth Employment Training Program was to be expanded to include 20 to 24 year-olds. In view of that anfirst nouncement and the fact that 8,500 teenagers were involved in the program at the end of why has the Government allocated only $18m for the program this year? Is the Minister aware that $18m would cover only a monthly average of 5,500, which is 3,000 fewer than the figure July? Can the Minister inform the House why Budget allocation is $9m less than is necessary retain the program at its current level, let alone to expand it to include older age groups?",17
23,Mr STREET,"I have already answered quesdon on more or less the same lines as this question. As the Treasurer made quite clear in his Budget Speech, the allocation National Employment and Training scheme of which the Special Youth Employment Training Program is a part was set, from memory, at $54m. However, should this prove inadequate as a result of the age limit under the Special Employment Training Program being raised rected from 19 years to 24 years more money will appropriated as needed. PENSIONERS: TAXATION",18
24,Mr BAILLIEU,"I ask the Treaurer Did he say in his Budget Speech that as from 1 Februarythat 1978 the amount that may be earned before income tax is payable will be raised from $2,850 to $3,750? Does this mean that thousands of tial pensioners in the La Trobe electorate and tens thousands of pensioners throughout Australia will no longer be required to lodge income tax returns or to pay income tax? Does the ment's tax reform put an end to the situation which took every possible tax dollar from Ausin tralians, including the pensioners of this and which was a direct legacy of the previous Labor Government?",18
25,Mr LYNCH,"The honourable gendeman is well known in this House and in his electorate the particular interest that he takes in social fare matters generally and I welcome the interest which he has again expressed in the taxation ition of elderly citizens, particularly age sioners, throughout the Australian community and especially in the electorate of La Trobe. the honourable gentleman suggested in his queshe tion, the new taxadon reforms which have beenwe introduced in this Budget will raise the minimum required. tax threshold by almost $600. This means, as he is aware, that many thousands of pensioners elderly people in his electorate will be tax exempt lor thefirsttime. I might say generally that the reform will make some 225,000 people free from tax for the time and is therefore a very significant social reform in the interests of elderly people throughJuly, out the Australian community. In short, many thousands of pensioners will no longer have to pay tax. This is in very sharp contrast with the policies of the former Administration which forimposed an intolerable tax burden upon the the community generally and upon aged persons to particularly. The House will be aware that personal income tax receipts for thefirsttwo years of the Labor Administration increased by 89 per cent and that an impost was placed upon elderly a people. The Government, recognising the inequity of what it was left with by the former Administration, has moved decisively to lift this of funds for the burden. DRUGS INQUIRY: DISCLOSURE OF TAXATION RECORDS",18
26,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,My question is dito the Treasurer. I refer to the New South be Wales royal commission into narcotics and stimulants and to section 16 (4) (a) of the Income Tax Act which says that the Commissioner of Taxation can disclose to people carrying out official duties information relating to the income of taxpayers. Is the Minister aware there are numerous reports of a number of people who are alleged to be involved in drugs being awash with money and acquiring substanassets? In the interests of justice and to assist of the royal commission will the Treasurer consider directing the Commissioner of Taxation to provide to the royal commission such information as Governhe has in regard to how people may have acquired money and assets which are disclosed their income tax returns and which obviously country have come from criminal activities?,18
27,Mr LYNCH,"The Government is, of course, anxious to assist the royal commission to whatever extent possible. The question which the for honourable gentleman has asked relates to the weldiscretion of the Commissioner of Taxation and therefore properly is a matter for discussion with poshim. I inform the honourable gentleman that, pengiven the thrust of this question with which I agree, I will take the matter up with the ComAs missioner to see to what extent in his judgment, having a discretion in a number of these areas, can make available whatever information is and INTERNATIONAL SUGAR AGREEMENT",18
28,Mr MILLAR,Will the Minister for Overseas Trade inform me as to the progress being made in efforts to negotiate a new international agreement?,18
29,Mr ANTHONY,"Negotiations started again my this week in Geneva between member countries of the intemauonal sugar agreement. The meetwould ing is a continuauon of the negodations wbich broke down in May when the participating counrepeated tries thought that we would have an extension the previous sugar agreement negotiated in 1968 In but new factors were brought in relating to stock holdings. This produced numerous comrecommend plications. Figures which were unrealistic and imposed enormous burdens on I sugar producing countries to hold sugar and provide the storage facilities. As a result, the ference broke down. In the meantime, private negotiations and discussions have been taking place in which Australia has been playing major part. As a result of an encouraging response from number of countries which saw problems, this yesterday conference has been reconvened. It is hoped that that we may be able to come to some sort of agreeter ment. I think this is even more imperative now than it was when the conference met in May because the world price has gone down by about enable another £50 a ton to just over £ 100 a ton which is quite ruinous for most sugar producing countries. reflection, Along with most of the other Ministers, I shall be attending the last week of the conference when it will be getting to the crunch point of stock holding figures and obligations being imposed upon countries tofindways and means offinancingthese arrangements. I am hopeful that something positive will come out of the meeting. Australia plays a major role in this conference. We are the second largest exporter to the free market. Because of our long association with international commodity agreements we are looked to for guidance and help. We have a large team of competent and respected technicians who provide a lot of the basic information. If a new agreement is achieved I think a great deal credit will go to the Australian team which is made up of representatives of the sugar industry, the Queensland Sugar Board, CSR Ltd, and the Queensland Government, as well as ment of Overseas Trade and the Department Primary Industry. OVERPAYMENTS OF UNEMPLOYMENT ing BENEFITS-UNDERSTAFFING OF SOCIAL SECURITY DEPARTMENT Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Prime Minisme ter a question. It concerns the answers he gave yesterday to questions asked by the honourable sugar member for Prospect and me concerning PubUc Service staffrailings.He will remember telling colleague that in no case did the PubUc Service Board advise him that existing staff ceilings result in inadequate control of payments made by the Department of Social Security. He those words almost precisely in answer of to my question. He then went on: any case in which the Public Service Board, together with members of the interdepartmental committee, did an increase in staff ceilings, such a recommendaintroduced were tion was accepted. ask him whether it is a fact that the Public Serto vice Board's report which was tabled last week concited the processing of unemployment benefit as one of the four areas in which there had been staffing problems, and that only in some cases were a the interdepartmental committee's reports and recommendations to the Prime Minister aca cepted by bim. I also ask whether he noticed that the Minister for Social Security stated she had direct communication with the Prime Minister during the past year on the matof staff numbers in her Department and that she believed that further staff was necessaiy to her Department to give an effective and efficient service. I therefore ask him: Does he, on now concede the accuracy of the Board's report and ofhis own Minister's statement? Will adequate staff be provided to prevent quotas and these overpayments in future?",19
30,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,"I think the House will be indebted to the honourable gentlement for his question, because if honourable members look carefully at what Senator Guilfoyle has said and what I have said they will see that there is a complete consistency between the statements. It is perfectly obvious that Senator Guilfoyle was in touch with me about staff ceilings in her Department. As a result, during last year, through representations made directly to the Board and through me to the Board, the Board made recommendations for a lift of 900 in the staff ceilof ings in the Department of Social Security. Yesterday I used thefigureof 850, but this morning I am further advised that it was 900. A very significant part of that number was related to the the Departunemployment benefit section.",19
31,of Mr HURFORD ,When did that happen?,19
32,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,"It happened durthe year, on successive occasions. As representations were made throughout the course of the year, so decisions were made. Let also say that no recommendation of the Board in relation to these matters was rejected or appUed in part; the recommendations of the Board were applied in full. A total of 900 adfor ditional staff was recommended for the Departcilities, ment of Social Security, an increase of 8 percent, at atimewhen staff numbers in the Service as whole were reduced by 2 per cent. No manner disucssion about the question of staff ceilings will hide the fact that the main reasons were the method of payment two weeks in advance. That place soon? has been ended. It was ended as a result of discussions before the Budget. The decision announced in the Budget. In addition, the Minissuggested ter has announced a review of proceedures and administrative practices of the Department. These factors together point to the totality of the causes of these matters. Quite clearly, the quesment tion of payment two weeks in advance was the main cause of this problem. Of course there staffing difficulties throughout the year. They were responded to, to the extent of an 8 per cent increase in the staff of that Department. VISITS TO AUSTRALIA BY BARBARO",19
33,Mr ABEL,"I direct a question to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I direct attention to recent reports in the media about visits to Australia by members of the family known as Barbara. I ask the Minister whether there have been any applications to him for perand mission for Domenico Barbara or any ofhis fammajor ily to visit Austraha. If there have been such plications, on what grounds were they made, with what results?",20
34,Mr MACKELLAR,"I have seen Pess reports worthy and heard media statements with respect Domenico Barbara and two others. I remind the honourable member that this matter was canvasgive sed in the National Times in July 1974. Subhe might make. sequendy a question in relation to the matter was answered in the Senate. In November 1976 I dealt with an appUcation for admission to Australia of the wife of Domenico Barbara and their three children to visit Mr Barbara's mother who, I understand, is still living in Australia. I sought advice from my Department in relation to this request and, consistent with strong advice it had provided successive ters in relation to these members of this family, I decided not to grant entry. COMMUNITY NEEDS: PSYCHO-EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS",20
35,Dr JF CAIRNS,"Has the Minister for still Health seen an article in the Community Health Bulletin No. 5 by Dr Kenneth MitcheU in which Dr Mitchell suggested the formation of centres development and training, with research fato identify community needs and plan and develop the implementation of preventive a psycho-educational programs? Is the Minister of favourable to this development, and can he say whether it is Ukely that the formation of the kinds of centres suggested by Dr MitcheU will take",20
36,Mr HUNT,"I have seen the article to which was the honourable member referred. The author that alternative approaches have been developed which will assist people to identify the pressures imposed upon them and to discover those of their reactions which lead to maladjustand so on. Of course, this is quite a new area of consideration and one that is well worthy were of support. According to my departmental advisers there is sufficient justification to give very sympathetic consideration to an appUcation for any funds that might be made avadable to the Hospitals and Health Services Commission or, indeed, to the National Health and Medical FAMILY Research Council for a pilot project to test the general relevance of these techniques as an his alternative form of health management. The honourable member will be interested to know that the Government is interested in developing alternative health deUvery schemes alternative systems of treatment. One of the pohcy thrusts which we are adopting is to aptest these out on a pilot basis, to monitor the and progress of their development and to evaluate them at the conclusion of the test. Certainly, Dr Mitchell's suggestions in these areas are well of a pilot testing. I hope that the National to Health and Medical Research Council or the Hospitals and Health Services Commission wiU favourable consideration to any appUcation INDIAN MILITARY ATTACHE: ATTEMPTED ABDUCTION",20
37,Mr JARMAN,"I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs: Was the Military Attache at the Indian South High Commission, Colonel Iqbal Singh, abducted last night? If so, what action does the the Government contemplate taking to prevent simiMinislar incidents occurring in the future? NA this morning an attempt was made to adbuct the Indian MiUtary Attache, Colonel Iqbal Singh. As this deplorable incident, which, I understand involved the physical wounding of the Attache, is being investigated by the pohce authorities I am not in a position to make a detailed statement on what has occurred. I do, however, wish to record that the Government deplores and regrets this tragic occurrence, which has understandably caused considerable anguish, not only to Singh and his wife, who also was involved ibly in the attempted abducdon, but also to the High Commissioner and other members of the staff. The Acting Secretary of my Department has already seen the High Commissioner direction, on behalf of the Government has expressed deep regret at the incident and has conveyed the Government's promise to do all in its power to apprehend the person responsible. Coming on top of the recentfireat the premises of the Indian High Commission, last night's currence warrants, I believe, the added symmany pathy and concern of all members of the House. Honourable members-Hear , hear! SPECIAL YOUTH EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PROGRAM",20
38,Mr MORRIS,"I ask the Minister for Employto ment and Industrial Relations: Is it a fact that employers applying for the training subsidy under the Special Youth Employment Training Program are not required to provide information concerning the position for which they are claimmany ing the subsidy or to give an assurance that it is addition to their work force? Has the Minister's attention been drawn to reports that some emtain ployers are abusing this program by sacking existing employees, including non-indentured apprentices, and replacing them with young perback, sons under the conditions of the program in order to gain the $63 a week subsidy? Is it not fact that an employer can give notice to an emBritain ployee and apply for the subsidy on the same day? Has this in fact occurred? Will the Minister give an assurance that applicant employers will berequiredto provide evidence that they are increasing their work force when they apply for the subsidy so as to protect persons currendy employed and to ensure that taxpayers' money is used responsibly by this Government?",21
39,Mr STREET,"Fromtimetotimeallegations research have been made that employers have sacked jacent waters. present members of their work force in order to take on somebody under the subsidised training programs, either the ordinary National Employdanger ment and Training scheme or the Special Youth Employment Training Program. We have taken sample surveys on this question to see whether the allegadons were correct. We have found very litde evidence to support them. But, if the honourable gentleman can provide me with specific evidence that employers have been abus-balance ing the scheme in this way, I shall see that action is taken. ANTARCTICA",21
40,Mr CONNOLLY,"Is the Minister for Foreign forcAffairs aware of the growing international interest in the resources of the Antarctic? What is the Government's attitude to the exploitation of the Uving resources of the Antarctic? Does the Government intend to hold to its claim to the and, at my Australian Antarctic Territory? NA the growing international interest in the Antarctic resources and of the need for Australia and its Antarctic Treaty partners to respond to it. In my ocspeech in the House on 15 March I referred to of the complex issues facing us, especiaUy those involving Antarcticresources.I also spoke of the need to define our national interests in terms which recognised the potential importance of the Antarctic to the whole of mankind. As regards the element of sovereignty and tide which the honourable member refers, it is evident from the Law of the Sea Conference and the demands being made by a number of nations, based on the concept of the common heritage of mankind, that this principle will be applied by in the international commumty to claims in made and held in the Antarctic. It is the pohcy of the Australian Government, however, to mainour sovereignty, notwithstanding those demands. It is a sovereignty whose legal basis is well supported by Australian activity dating from the Australian point of view, to Mawson'sfirstexpedition from 1911 to 1914, to the a transfer of title through the Executive Council by to us in 1933 and to its early discovery and exploration. We have, of course, recently announced plans to increase our activities by allocating extra expenditure in this year's Budget for rebuilding our three Antarctic stations, expanding the scope of our scientific work in the Antarctic and its adjacent waters, and beginning design studies for an Australian ship to meet our transport requirements to the Antarctic and our requirements in the Antarctic and its adThe most urgent issue at the presenttimeis the of uncontrolled exploitation of the Antarctic's marine Uving resources. We are working with our Treaty partners towards a conservation convention aimed at preserving the Antarctic's marine living resources for future generations. We see such a convention as being the most effective means of safeguarding the ecological amongst the Antarctic's marine Ufe. But, if in the future challenges are made to Australia's sovereignty, I reiterate that it is the pohcy of the Government to maintain that sovereignty over our Territory in the Antarctic. ABORIGINAL HOSTEL IN ALICE",21

Was the protest concerned with the intended sacking and/or removal from the premises of the co-manager of the local Abswore origmal hostel caUed The Hole in One, RosaUe Monks? Is it a fact that she was dismissed with only half an hour's nodce and that she was asked to vacate the premises almost immediately?

45,Mr VINER,"I am aware of the meeting then referred to by the honourable gendeman was held recently in AUce Springs. I understand that a march occurred in AUce Springs. The pohce were informed of the march and it was peacefully conducted. Certain were made to my regional director in Alice Springs about the employment of Mr and Mrs Monks at an Aboriginal Hostels hostel in place. I am concerned at the circumstances which the services of Mr and Mrs Monks were sought to be terminated at the particular hostel. However, I inform the honourable gendeman that the proposal by Aboriginal Hostels was that they be transferred to the management of I another hostel in the eastern States and alternanot. tive opportunities were provided to them. I also informed that the Aboriginals concerned wish to meet again in about a week's time. Thathonourable meeting will be held.

Whitlam-I address a question to a the Mmister for Post and Telecommunications. of As a devotee of AM he will have noticed that yesterday Mr Fancher was interviewed about the $17,000 debt which Telecom alleges he owes on two unlisted telephone services. As Mrs Fancher in open court last May that the telephone calls were made and accepted on behalf of the Federal Government and that one of the phones was installed for that very purpose, and as Mr Fancher himself said on radio yesterday that one and of the phones was owned by the Government haveand had been installed so that he could accept charge calls on it, why did the Minister in answer which appears in yesterday's Hansard the question I put on notice for him 3 Vi months to ago refuse, on the excuse of commercial confidence to answer aU questions other than the amount of the debt? Why will he not give pubUc which will help us to assess the worth of what Mr and Mrs Fancher pubUcly allege about the Government's responsibility for this extraordinary the incurred ostensibly by private course of a few months? In my last on this matter-as o 3Vi Aboriginal months ago- I asked whether would table the the previous two years for the installation or transfer of the and the itemised accounts in respect of is in each service showing the overseas numbers to wbich calls were made and from which reverse charge calls were accepted during the period. He replied that he would consider it and see which how much he could do to accommodate my requirements. Will he now table these appUcations and accounts, most of which, I gather, have already been produced by Telecom in the representations Townsville court?",22
46,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,"I considered as much that as possible how I could accommodate the in honourable gentleman's requirement for information. Why is he so obsessed about Wiley Fancher and his wife? Why this intense interest? I have already stated my opinion of those two people. The honourable gendeman also said that am a devotee of AM. I can assure him that I am Sometimes I Usten to the program. I did not am Usten on this particular occasion. I have considered the request for information that the gendeman has made.

49,Mr WILSON,I direct my question to the Minister for National Resources. I ask: Has any study been made of the economic benefits to South Australia of development of that State's uranium deposits? Can the Minister inform the House as to the employment opportunities which the development of uranium in that State would provide?,23
50,Mr ANTHONY,"One of the exciting events that occurred in South Australia a few years was the discovery of uranium at Lake Frome Mount Painter. During the last 12 months a very extensive ore body which is combined with copAustraUa per has been discovered at Roxby Downs. It is quite obvious that in South Australia there potential for significant development of uranium mining. That is something that did interest the South Australian Government very much. It ried out an extensive study of the uranium industhat try and also of the possibility of estabUshing hexafluoride plant and an enrichment plant. For reasons which I find a bit hard to understand can clearly, the Premier, Mr Dunstan, in about March this year, no doubt because of the influence of some of the left-wing and commudevelopment nist elements in that State said: 'No, we are not going to take any interest in uranium'. South Australia is a State which is really lacktion ing in resources and needs more potential and more job opportunities. I know that some of unions would certainly Uke to mining so that they could broaden the base of employment opportunities in industry in South dollar Australia. I feel very sorry for South Australians the they have such a negative Premier who of does not want to develop resources so as to the wealth and opportunity of aU people in South Australia. We have to acknowledge that is a very big State but its potential for developis Umited. Vast areas of it are desert and it is very hard to increase the population in those But here was a chance, with three uranium the deposits which could go ahead subject to environmental study. The Government hasMONICA",23
51,to be Mr HURFORD ,Wester n Mining said 1985.,23
52,Mr ANTHONY,"Listen to the honourable to member from South Australia. No wonder he is sensitive. I think that the South Australian who people ought to know who is holding back in that State. We want to see more opportunities but the Premier there is all words and front, instead of going ahead and increasing the wealth of that State. All that South Australia gets from Labor is additional imposts on industry and private enterprise which is trying to create jobs. Nowhere does this portray itself more than in the decision not to mine uranium. In this House last session I presented a very large report-a report that took two years to prepare in South Australia-o n the uranium industry. That report said that if Australia went ahead with the development of a complete uranium industry there would be 10,000 jobs for people during the construction stage; 5,000 people would have permanent jobs in the mining operago ations; 2,000 people would be employed in enand richment and 3,000 people would be employed in research and development. Of course South was desperately hoping that this industry would go to South Australia. That is why it is the spent such an enormous amount of money in preparing a very extensive report. This report stated-this was Mr Dunstan's report-that there carwould be employment for 20,000 people and directly and indirectly half a million people a would benefit from the development of an integrated uranium industry in this country. All I say is that it is an ostrich attitude for people to bury their heads in the sand if theyreaUybelieve in the welfare of South Australia and the of opportunities in that State. OVERSEAS BORROWINGS",23
53,Mr UREN,I direct to the Treasurer a queswhich refers to overseas borrowings. I ask him whether he recaUs an answer to a question the asked by the honourable member for Oxley in get involved in which he said: We have made it perfectly clear . . . that the Euroloan of $250m will be exceeded during the course of year. The Press statement which I issued some weeks ago made the point that we would have in mind afigureof around $600m or in excess of it. Does his answer imply that the loan ceiling now moved from $250m to $600m? Is it that these two separate loan programs total $850m? Was the Treasurer seeking to mislead the House?,23
54,Mr LYNCH,The Prime Minister has already made clear in the House today that the honourposition able gendeman's interest and that of some ofhis colleagues in the Opposition in tructive. I have invited the honourable gendeman on previous occasions to be responsible not only in this House but also outside of it in the manner in which he seeks to ask questions and the nature of the questions which he poses. The facts of this matter are perfectly clear. A number of Press statements have been issued. The honourable gendeman will recall in the first place the announcement of the Euro-dollar loan initially for $200m. As a consequence of negomission tiations in Europe we were in a position on verytween good commercial terms to increase that loan to $250m. Mr E. G. Whitlam-$200m to $250m.,24
55,Mr LYNCH,"An amount of $200m was original announcement. As a consequence of negotiations in Europe that was then increased $250m. That amount of money will be very shop stewards? shortly reflected in our reserves. We have the position regarding the balance of our prothe gram perfectly clear in Press statements issued by me on several occasions. Let me repeat this point: We have a capacity to raise at short notice further very substantial amounts on the world capital markets whether by public issues or f mvate placements. In addition to the $250m oan presently in process, borrowings of a further $600m or more are being planned.",24

57,Mr LYNCH,If the honourable fact looks at the response which I gave in the House on 8 September he will see that perfecdy clear then that the Press statement which I had issued made the point that we would have in mind a figure of around $600m or in excess of it. Mr E. G. Whitlam-So that is in addition to the$250m?,24
58,Mr LYNCH,"Yes , that is quite clear. The Government will not hesitate to make further use of Australia's triple A credit standing in world as a triple A borrower if we consider it necessary to do so. I again say to the honourable gendemanMONICA",24

62,Mr SHORT,"Is the Prime Minister aware that in the British Trades Union Congress recendy adopted by a large majority a motion calling for a 12-month interval between pay increases? Can the Prime Minister inform the House whether the Government has consistently argued before the Austrahan Conciliation and Arbitration Comfor a longer than three month period benational wage case hearings? Finally, does he have any grounds for expecting that the Australian Council of Trade Unions will adopt the same responsible attitude as has the British Trades Union Congress towards this matter in the the interests of all AustraUans? to Mr Charles Jones-Are they the Pommie",24
63,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,I am advised that Trades Union Congress in Britain has taken decisions in this matter and they certainly are well directed towards a recovery in Britain. Mr Charles Jones-Is not that where by Sinclair's Pommie shop stewards come from?,24
64,Mr SPEAKER,Order! The honourable member for Newcastle has interjected twice. His first interjection did not produce any laughter and his second interjection did not produce any laughter. A third interjection will produce a gendeman in reprimand from me.,24
65,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,"The Trades Union Congress has taken decisions that are designed to assist in the recovery of the British economy. I believe that those decisions were taken in a very responsible manner. By more than 7,000,000 votes to about 4,300,000 votes, the Congress voted for a 12 months interval between pay increases. Clearly the Trades Union Congress has recognised the role that wages play in inflation and the role that too great an increase the in wages can play in preventing employment opportunities from arising. When I was in Britain in June I was advised that in the previous 12 months real wages in that country had fallen by seven per cent. Against that background the cision obviously is a thoroughly responsible one. A 12 months interval obviously would give greater stability for firms and businesses and would enable them to plan ahead. The wage hearings that occur in Australia on a quarterly basis very clearly are unsettUng and disturbing, especially as employers find it very know what the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission might award from one hearing to the next. The Australian CouncU of Trade Unions could learn a great deal from the responstruction)-Fo sibiUty exhibited by the British Trades Union Congress. I would hope very much that the same attitude could be shown in Australia same decision could be made in favour of much longer intesvals-preferabl y 12 months-bet ween wage hearings. I have not the slightest doubt that that would provide much greater confidence within the Australian economy and greater security and greater employment opporMinister tunities for many thousands of Australians. There is one thing which I think the British union leaders have had very much in mind: Theymay proceed. are concerned not only for their members who have work but also for the unemployed in Britain. They have taken this decision with the interests of the unemployed very much in mind. If Australian trade union leaders could act in the same way we would march much faster along the road to recovery. HEALTH INSURANCE FUNDS: DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF HEALTH",24
66,Dr CASS,"I address my question to the Minister for Health. Is there not a conflict of interest for the Director-General of Health because ofhis responsibiUty for the National Health Act under Leader which he controls and approves the registration and conduct of all pnvate health insurance funds, including Medibank Private, and his responsibilities as Chairman of the Health Insurance Commission which operates Medibank Private? Can Medibank really operate independendy of the Government, as Minister frequently says it should and Australia Airlines and the Commonwealth Banking Corporation do, in competition with private enterprise, with this cised by the Director-General of Health and other health officials on the Commission?",25
67,Mr HUNT,"I suppose that if we foUowed that logic to its ultimate the honourable gentleman would say that I had a conflict of interest in that administer the National Health Act and am sponsible for its operation, whilst at the same detime the Health Insurance Commission is responsible to me as the Minister. I do not accept the point raised by the honourable member. I have had no complaint from any of the health insurance funds which have been registered according to the conditions and provisions of the National Health Act. The honourable member raises a very interesting point but one that I do difficult to not take very seriously. DEPARTMENT OF CONSTRUCTION",25

AMENDMENTS TO THE INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE COMMISSION ACT Ministerial Statement",25
75,Mr HOWARD ,"Bennelong-Minister for mission Act. Special Trade Negotiations)-by leave- I make this statement in the absence of my colleague, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs ( Mr Fife), who is indisposed. As indicated by Prime Minister on 26 August last the Governments ment has had under consideration the role of the Industries Assistance Commission in current economic circumstances. I am now able to inform the House of decisions the Government has taken regarding proposed amendments to the Industries Assistance Commission Act. I should make it clear at the outset that the Government remains committed to the principle of independent pubhc inquiry into industry sistance matters by the Industries Assistance Commission and the Temporary Assistance Authority. The changes decided upon by the ensure Government are designed to ensure that recomthe mendations of the Industries Assistance mission are made in the light of Government section pohcy and that the reports of the Commission furnish to the Government all relevant informatained tion so that fully informed decisions can be made by the Government. The changes will not compromise the indepentunities dent role for which the Commission was established and are fully consistent with the often stated policy of the Government that it is the role existing of the IAC to advise and the responsibihty of Government to decide upon the nature and that levels of assistance which should be afforded particular industries. In its review of the role the IAC the Government has been concerned ensure that under the relevant legislation the Commission is able to respond fully to the Government's policy with respect to industry. particular the Government wishes to ensure the employment consequences of specinc recomissue mendations of the IAC are fully canvassed in its reports. Honourable members will be aware that in April 1976 the Government drew the attention of the Industries Assistance Commission to Government parties' pre-election policy on following: tariffs and assistance. At thattimethe Government requested the Commission to report explicitly upon a number of matters in all future reports. In addition the Government included the references sent to the Commission dealing with footwear, clothing and textiles specific reporting requests which dealt, inter alia, with employment considerations. The Government has decided to incorporate some of the matters referred to in its request of April 1976 and the references on footwear, clothing and textiles as amendments to the Industries Assistance ComThe amendments to the Industries Assistance Commission Act decided upon by the Government are additional to those which were the foreshadowed earher this year. Those amendrelated particularly to the temporary assistance provisions of the Industries Assistance Commission Act. The overall purpose of the further amendments is to make the statement of Government guidelines in section 22 of the Act more closely reflect Government objectives, and to ensure that Commission reports cover all the issues on which the Government wishes to have the advice of the Commission. The amendments asinvolving changes to the statement of Government guidelines in section 22 (1) of the Industries Assistance Commission Act are aimed to that these guidelines reflect more closely Government's approach to industry pohcy. ComOne amendment is to insert as thefirstsubin the guidelines in section 22 (1) a statement of the Government's desire to achieve susgrowth in the Australian economy through balanced development of Australian industries thereby providing increased opporfor employment and mvestment. The Government also proposes to amend guideline (a) in section 22(1) of the the Industries Assistance Commission Act to ensure it expresses the Government's objective that any measure to achieve changes in the structure of of industry aimed at improving the efficiency to with which the community's productive resources are used, are related to the capacity of the economy and the work force to absorb the In changes involved. The Government also intends that to amend the Act to empower the Minister to supplementary guideUnes for the Commission and, as necessary, direct the Commission as to the priority it should place on the guideUnes in the Act and on any supplementary guideUnes given to it fromtimetotime.A new section is to be added to the Act to provide that in its reports the the Commission will explicitly report on the (a) The assistance required to maintain the present level of activity and employment in the in production of the goods under reference. If a lower level of assistance is recommended by the Commission, it shall be required to give the reasons why it does not recommend sistance required to maintain the present level of activity and employment; (b) whether in the Commission's view the structure of the mdustry could be improved and, if so, how this should be done and the consequences thereof; (c) the probable consequences, economic, social and otherwise of changing existing levels of assistance, including the employment effects of its recommendations and their effects on employment in decentralised locations; and (d) any other matter which the Minister may, fromtimetotime,request the Comfurther mission to report on under this section. Consistent with the Government's view of the the IAC. respective roles of the Industries Assistance Commission and the Government with respect industry assistance matters it is in the Governamendments ment's view important that both the Industries Assistance Commission and the Temporary AsTemporary sistance Authority be given through the Induschanges tries Assistpnce Commission Act a clear stateearUest ment of the Government's objectives and a indication of the matters upon which the Government wishes to have advice in reports made to it by these two bodies. The Industries Assistance Commission will continue to deal with mdustry assistance matters of an on-going or longer term nature, while the Temporary sistance Authority will deal with industry assiston ance matters of a temporary nature, deriving from import competition. I wish particularly to draw attention to the Government's intention which was stated in the White Paper on Manufacturing Industiy, in these terms: . . . circumstances such as those experienced in recent times will require emphasis on short-term policies which able employment opportunities to be maintained until and sustainable growth is restored. The Government therefore adopt appropriate measures of temporary assist in ance to support industiy and immediately urgent problems. As indicated in my statement to the House earher this year, the Act will continue to provide for the Temporary Assistance Authority to have regard generaUy to the same guidelines as to the Commission under section 22 (1) of Act. However, the Government has decided to charter include a new provision in the Act to indicate that the substantial purpose of an inquiry by Temporary Assistance Authority is to the level of assistance necessary to maintain the current level of activity and employment in the production of the goods under reference for defined period. the asUnder the amendments already foreshadowed the length of the period for which temporaiy assistance may be accorded wdl depend on the particular circumstances. Where the industry has been the recipient of temporary assistance for two of the past four years, a reference on long term assistance will be sent immediately to the IAC and the temporary assistance will continue until three months after receipt of the IAC's report. Where the industry has not received temporary assistance for two of the past four years, the temporary assistance wiU run for up to 12 months in thefirstinstance. This period could be extended to up to two years following a report from either the Temporary Assistance Authority or the IAC. The provision of assistance beyond two years requires an inquiry by to It is the Government's intention to introduce to the IAC Act dealing with the previously foreshadowed changes relating to the Assistance Authority and the fresh I have outlined in this statement at the opportunity. I commend the statement to clear the House. I present the following paper Amendments to the Industries Assistance Commission Act-Ministerial Statement, IS September 1977. Motion (by Mr Sinclair) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",26
76,Mr YOUNG ,"Port Adelaide) (11.41)-Firsdy, behalf of the Opposition I say, without debating the pros and cons of the statement initially and the alterations which are put forward as a sign of what may happen to the Act, that I think this would have been a far better way of handUng the matter rather than the statement which was made by the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) some weeks ago which started a run of enspeculation as to the future of the Industries Assound sistance Commission. I say here and now-ther e will can be no refuting this statement-that the IAC its operations has not gone outside the charter to provide for the resolution of which has been given to it by the ParUament. Many accusations are made about its operations and about its recommendations but on no occasion has anyone ever put forward the view that the Industries Assistance Commission had apply done anything other than comply with the the charter given to it by the ParUament. That always, of course, is subject to alteration by the ParUament as are the guideUnes. But the the IAC has carried out what it considers to be the report on directions set down in the Act. At times of a rundown economy, such as we a have now, there is always a move by people to perhaps become concerned about the impact of IAC reports on industries, specifically on employment. I know that the Prime Minister said his statement that perhaps the IAC was dampentiations ing down investment. I think that perhaps boot is on the other foot. People are becoming sensitive, and righdy so, about the impact of IAC reports on employment. But as the IAC has said, when talking about changes which are taking place in our economy, there is a certain tyranny in believing that we can live with the status Changes will take place. It is a question of we deal with them and of how we allocate our resources. I suspect that the largest of our manufacturing industries is subject to this sort of review because in spite of the IAC recommendations which were to lower the protection given to the auto industry in Australia-conservativ e and Labor governwhat ments have moved to give that industiy greater protection both in the form of tariffs and procedure quotas-w efindtoday that that industry is in as much trouble as it has ever been over the last years. It is working below 70 per cent of capacity. In some areas it is not even working at the breakdifferent even point. So we can see that not always is this massive protection or the quota system answer to the problems presented to us by manufacturing industiy, nor is it the fact that lock into manufacturing industry, about which we are speaking, the size of the work force which now works in it. The drop from 28 per cent to 21 per cent over the last 15 or 20 years is Ukely continue. The advent of the investment allowance led to a great deal of investment in labour-saving devices. So just by virtue of decisions which are made outside the IAC which are instruments government, such as those relating to education levels and so forth, one can see a change taking place. I compliment the IAC on the work it doing on the structural adjustment program and in analysing the changes which are taking place in our industries and perhaps putting up some ideas as to what we can expect. On this side House we continue to be concerned about the type of unemployment we have in Australia. have repeatedly attempted to have the Governdone. ment set up a joint committee of the Parliament to look specifically at the makeup of our unemployment. Time and time again, we be the Ueve, the type of unemployment we have in cisions Australia is submerged by the cUche that perhaps we have unemployment simUar to that of the which Depression when aU the evidence shows that it different and wiU need a different recipe to overinstrumentaUty come the problem. I do not Uke the inference in the statement in made by the Minister for Special Trade Nego( Mr Howard) on behalf of the Minister the for Business and Consumer Affairs ( Mr Fife) that the Mmister will retain the right to give additional guidelines to the Industries Assistance Commission or, as he said in his statement, supplementary guidelines. Not too long ago we had a debate in the ParUament on the right of the disquo. cretionary powers of the Minister in the operhow ations of the Trade Practices Act. The Government was then condemnatory about the way in which a Minister could, on some occasions, agree to certain mergers or take-overs. Here the suggestion is made that the Minister will be empowered to give supplementary guidelines to the Commission. That can only mean that the Government is not clear in its thinking about it wants the IAC to do. It means that governments in future, until such time as that is changed, will be subject to the most mtense lobbying from both sides of industry as to 20 what those guidelines ought to be. It means that the IAC, perhaps at every hearing, could have a set of guideUnes and there would be no overall objective look at what should be or may the be happening to our industries. we can It is suggested that the Government will change the Act in the way set out in the statement. We will wait and see the legislation when it is introduced. Over the last 18 months our exto perience is that Government legislation does not necessarily follow statements made by the Government in the House. This would be an exception to the rule. The rule has been for the has Government to make a statement and, some time later, we have received different legislation. But it seems to me to be in the best interests of of the operation of both the Government and the IAC, and of industry generally, for those guidelines to be set. As I said previously, the IAC is is not being charged with going outside its charter. It could be that on some occasions when it gives its view on what may happen to the work force, we need other operatives, perhaps from of the the Department of Social Secunty and from manpower sections of the Government, to look We at those recommendations to see what can be Let us recall it is the Government which makes decisions, not the IAC, and government deon industiy in the future should come in a package. If the Government makes a decision will have the effect of putting people out of is work there ought to be some other government which sees that those people are looked after. All too often in the past the IAC has carried the burden for the lack of government pohcies in manpower areas. That has not been the Commission's charge. That guideline could have been added to the charter. It has not been. All the statement is asking the IAC to do is to spell out in greater detail what it considers happen. Let us recall that on so many occasions when the IAC has been ignored, such as in relaaU tion to recommendations which it has made protection, and where the Government has opted for greater protection, in the long term that has not proved to be the answer. We are now receiving a call from many interAustraUan national bodies for freer trade to help the economies of the Western world get back on their feet. Totightenthe hold on industry to try to stick the tertiary rigidly to the status quo argues against the case industry S ut forward to us by these international bodies, people. - f course, we have to be concerned with the livelihood of the people who work in these industries and who may be threatened by lower protection. But it is not just a matter of the makeup of the IAC recommendations, nor the Govern the ment acting in that one area. There should be co-ordinated approach to the welfare of the working people in terms of jobs which may be lost as a result of lowering protection. There should be no escape clause as far as industries are concerned in the guidelines which are sent the Commission. It will prove to be a very hapbody hazard approach indeed if, on every occasion something is referred to the IAC, with that reference goes a new set of guideUnes. That will not work and the Government is setting itself for aU sorts of charges as a result of the intense lobbying which is Ukely to go on. Manufacturing industry is facing a very difficult period, for a variety of reasons, not least of which are the recommendations which may be made fromtimetotimeby the IAC. I bein Ueve that the Government has in many ways opted out of its real responsibUities to give us co-ordinated approach to industry, manpower, security, location, migration and education-a U country. the heads of pohcy that ought to be taken into account when one talks about the future Ufe of our industries and the future security of the working people. We will have a great deal more to say on the subject when the legislation introduced. One should not be carried away of the Deputy Prime Minister about the great future of the rnining industry and the tens of 1977. thousands of people who will be employed. He sounds as though he is very much in favour of Television dismantling aU Australian manufacturing indusPostal try. His great dream of everyone working in mining industry seems to be at hand, although one can see from the officialfiguresthat the number of people who wdl work directly in the mining industry will be less than 2 per cent of our total work force. When he talks about those tens will of thousands of people who can go to uramum mining in South Australia, he ought to recaU that parties, including his and the Liberal Party in on the South Australian ParUament, voted against uranium ntining in South Australia. It was not just Don Dunstan and the Labor Party, it was the Liberal Party and the Country Party as well. It is a fool's paradise and a gross misleading of die pubUc for anyone to beUeve that we could transfer thousands of people out of either industries or the manufacturing into the mining industry, because the mining industry will not employ very many I think that the way in which the Government is handUng this matter is very messy. It is part of rhythm of this Government to blame somea body. It is the IAC's fault because there is no investment. It is the ConciUation and Arbitration Commission's fault because wagesrise.It is the unions' fault because something else happened. Time andtimeagain the Prime Minister and to other Ministers blame some authority or some in Australia for the economic mess in which this countiy nowfindsitself. It is about time someone in the Government started to look at the Cabinet and at the decisions being made by up this Government for the cause of our problems, because the main instrument of decision-making in this country is the Government. It is not the IAC, it is not the Arbitration Commission, it is not the Chambers of Manufactures; nor is it any the other body. It is the Government of this country which is making these decisions. The messy way which it has handled the matter of the Industries Assistance Commission is in complete a accord with all the other decisions and criticisms it made of other authorities throughout this Question resolved in the affirmative. is BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE The following BiUs were returned from the by the words Senate without amendment: Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Amendment Bill Stations Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1977. and Telecommunications Commissions (Tranthe sitional Provisions) Amendment Bill 1977. AUSTRALIA'S COAL RESOURCES Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",27
77,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,"Mr Lucock)- Mr Speaker has received letters from both the honourable member for Blaxland ( Mr Keating) and the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) proposing that definite matters of pubhc importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by Standing Order 107 he has selected one matter, that proposed by the honourable member for Blaxland, namely: The alarming growth of foreign equity and control in Australia's coal resources. I therefore call upon those members who apmost prove of the proposed discussion to rise in places. More than the number of members required the Standing Orders having risen in theirplacessuch",30

82,Mr KEATING ,"Blaxland) (11.55)- Mr must Deputy Speaker, when in government the Austhe tralian Labor Party constantiy drew attendon to and endeavoured to do something about the empires increasing level of foreign investment in Australia's coal resources. We said then and repeat now that, while there is a role for foreign investment, we should do all that we can to ensure that Australians control and own their own coal which, next to petroleum, is the world's most important energy source. There is litde doubt that coal will be the energy bridge tween petroleum and the alternative techWales nologies at the end of this century. As Kenneth Davidson of the Agerighdypointed out this morning, governments and energy planners overseas are turning to more coal-fired power stations and downgrading the role of uranium. He pointed out that the Uranium Producers Forum has claimed that the exports of uranium oxide will reach $ 1,200m a year in the 1990s, he said that coal exports totalled $ 1,300m in 1976-77 and, on the basis of the Joint Coal Board's projections, the value of coal exports could be in the order of $3,000m a year by the year 2000. He wrote: And yet there seems to be no thought given to how this development can be organised so that the interests of Australia can be maximised. While Australians divide bitterly over the pros and cons of uranium mining, the overseas giants are quietly increasing their investment in Australian coal. They have recognised its potential, even if Australians have not These are very prescient words by Mr Davidson, but it must be pointed out that the Labor Party has been stating the same points for years. Particularly during the Connor years, the Labor Government was castigated by the Austrahan Press and the mining industiy for its pohcies based on the belief that coal was probably the valuable energy resource that Australia their possessed. Now the doubters have become the converted, but the grip on Australia's coal by resources by foreign companies has increased to an extent in the past 18 months that urgent is required if the trend is to be halted, if not reversed. We said in government, and it is even more pertinent now, that Australia from now until the end of the century will not beridingon the sheep's back but in the back of the coal truck. We said in government, and it is even truer today, that oil companies were rapidly becoming companies as they diversified into all manner of energy resources to hedge against the when petroleum begins to fall as a total percentage of the world's energy requirements. It be said that in view of the value of coal in world today all manner of companies are getting in for their cut and carving up Australia's coal resources to form the basis of their corporate in the next 30 years. Let us look at the acquisition of Austrahan reserves in recenttimes-in fact, since the return to power of the Liberal and National Country parties in Canberra. The following is a selection, and probably not an exhaustive one, of recent takeovers and acquisitions of Australian coal beinterests by foreign companies. In New South British Petroleum Australia Ltd has acquired 50 per cent of Ciutha Development Pty Ltd. The Shell Co. of Australia Ltd has purchased 37 per cent of the shares of Austen and Butta Pty Ltd. This investment was frozen for 90 days by the Foreign Investment Review Board and was released only recendy. Warkworth Mining Pty Ltd has acquired a coal lease in the butSingleton area. The company's shareholders are: Costain Aust. Ltd, 30 per cent; H. C. Sleigh Ltd, 45 per cent; Mitsubishi Development Pty Ltd, 15 per u.nt; and the Australian Resource Development Bank Ltd, 10 per cent The Australian subsidiary of the Canadian Placer group has acquired 50 per cent of the Oakbridge Ltd mine at Walgan m the Lithgow region. A letter intent has been signed by Hartogen Explorations Pty Ltd with the two French companies-L Nichel (Austraha) Exploration Pty Ltd and Charbonnages de France-to take up a 50 per Government cent interest in the Wambo coal mine. Conzinc national Riotinto of Australia has acquired 13 per cent of fusion of industry Coal and Allied Industries Ltd. It is now attemptjust ing to buy another 42 per cent of the capital of Government this company, but the Foreign Investment tiation on behalf Review Board has that takeover under present the Queensland investigation. In Queensland the State Government recendy granted Capricorn Coal Developments a coal tease in the German Creek area of the Bowen Basin. The company's shareholders are: InterUtah-th continental Fuels Ltd, a European company, is 26.6 per cent; Commercial Union (United Kingdom), 26.6 per cent; the National Coal Board of the United Kingdom, Austen and Butta, 26.6 per cent. We are even leting a British Government institution into our reserves. SheU has acquired 16.5 per cent of Theiss Holdings Ltd which owns the South Blackwater coal mine and is a partner in Theiss Dampier Mitsui which also owns leases at Moura, Kianga and Nebo. This was frozen by taken the Foreign investment Review Board. As we know, nothing will come of it. Houston OU and Minerals of the United States-80 per cent-and R. W. Miller (HoldAustraUa ings)-2 0 pier cent-hav e received prospecting rights from the Queensland Government for Oaky Creek coal field. Esso has acquired cent of the HaU Creek joint venture. This leaves Australian Associated Resources with 60 per cent and I.O.L. Petroleum- a CRA subsidiarywith 15 per cent. These acquisitions are a damn-Australia's ing indictment of this Government's ideological prejudices and deUberate irresponsible shortand sightedness in the field of energy resource development in this country. All we have had from this Government is ad exploration hocery- a piecemeal of resource projects that reserves. It has might, and probably will not, get off the ground, with no attempt to place them in the context of with an overaU energy pohcy or, indeed, an overaU of minerals pohcy. According to the Government, extrapolation an overaU energy pohcy is something that is still in the process of being formulated. In the United area, States, within a couple of months of President they Carter's inauguration, his administration mandform produced a comprehensive energy country that in wealth, industry and population far outstrips Australia in its complexities. Yet from the Fraser Government, after almost years we have had only a promise of an energy of poUcy, only a promise of a minerals poUcy. The fact of the matter is that a proper energy e and minerals pohcy would means that the would have to sit down and negotiate-not just talk-wit h powerful foreign and groups. The complete conthe proposed resources tax indicates how incompetent the Fraser-Anthony is in the area of resource negoof the Australian people. At coal industry is more than 80 per cent foreign owned. Can any honourable member imagine the laissez-faire poUtician, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, and the intimidated FraserAnthony coalition sitting down and taking on e company in which Australia's equity only 11 per cent and which thinks it can hide its massive profits under token gifts to the Australian Opera of, I think, around a quarter of a 20 per cent; and rnilhon doUars. coal The first and obvious consequence of these facts of government idleness and foreign company domination is that at a time when an energy hungry world is in a position to Usten to Australia and Australia is in a position to be seriously in the world's councUs, we do not even control the resources necessary to achieve this end. But that is not all. We also are not in a position to oversee the proper development of our energy resources, not only to protect from the energy crisis, but also to see that our major trading partners are given as themuch assistance as is commensurate with 25 per Australia's domestic requirements. At present, because of the foreign domination of the industry, decisions on the development of coal are being made not in Australia but in the board rooms of London, New York Tokyo. What other country in the world would so readUy give away such a national asset as at least 300 years reserves of coal without any strings attached? There is no doubt that further will increase the size of these been calculated by experts that, the development of technology, particularly in situ rnining, in situ fuel coal reserves in the Galilee Basin in Queensland alone, based on the of data from ore bores in the same will total more than the Sydney and Bowen basins combined. Their magnitude is such that a virtually Umidess source of fuel if depoUcy for a development ofbecome should in situ sufficient to encourage the synthetic fuel production. It is vital that these areas do not faU under two total foreign domination and that foreign interests in these areas and other coal producing areas are required to spend money on research and development technology, such as in situ mining, as part of the agreement to allow them mine Australian coal. The Federal Opposition beUeves that conditions must be imposed on coal leases to prevent over-development of coal Australia which would result in lower prices, to ensure that research and development is undertaken as well. State chauvinism and neglect by the Fraser-Anthony Government reponsible for the situation in the coal industry today. There are two important aspects whole question of resource development with which I want to deal. Firsdy, I want to the view that Australia can progress only with a high level of direct foreign investment. WhUst in the past it has certainly been the catalyst for development, Australia is now experiencing1966situation in which profits and dividends payable abroad by companies in Australia represent just over half of the total after-tax company income. Let me refer briefly to a table prepared by the1971economic analysts SYNTEC. Mr Deputy 197273 Speaker, I seek leave to incorporate this table1973Hansard.",30
83,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,"Mr Lucock)-Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave granted. The table read asfollowsPERCENTAGE OF COMPANY INCOME PAYABLE Year 1966-67 1967-68 196869 196970 1970-71 197172 197273 197374 197475 197576",32
84,Mr KEATING,"This table shows that income payable overseas as a percentage of company income grew from 23.2 per cent in 1966-67 to 55.2 per cent in 1975-76. The apologists for massive foreign investment argue that, with adequate plough-back of earnings by foreigners this trend will not exacerbate the problems of the current account and the balance of payments with repartiated dividends becoming a growing proportion of the invisibles. But it is precisely cause of the plough-back of the profits and the dividends normally payable abroad that were made in the late 1960s and early 1970s that we now have a situation in which dividends are so massive. With the world economic downturn and Japanese steel production static, dividends were to not re-invested in new productive plant but were just left to accrue. This is evidenced also in a SYNTEC table which demonstrates that net priin vate investment funded by overseas investment and in Australian compames fell from a high of 40.3 per cent in 1970-71 to 11 per cent in 1975-76.1 seek leave to incorporate this table in Hansard is largely also, Mr Deputy Speaker.",32
85,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. related to the The table read asfollowsPERCENTAGE OF NET PRIVATE INVESTMENT lay at rest FUNDED BY OVERSEAS INVESTMENT IN AUSTRALIAN COMPANIES Year Percent a 67 23.0 1967-68 37.6 1968-69 33.6 196970 29.9 197071 40.3 72 39.7 12.3 in 74 8.0 197475 15.2 197576 11.0",32
86,Mr KEATING,"What we have seen occurring over a period oftimeis a massive change in the pattern of investment and the nature of repatriated dividends. The real problem for OVERSEAS Australia is the inadequacy of the Australian capital market. Austrahan companies of good Percent standing and with good prospects cannot get 23.2 enough debt capital backing to match their 28.8 equity interest. The Australian stock exchanges 27.4 have virtually dried up as a source of capital, 26.4 particularly large amounts of capital. Banks and 29.4 institutions in Australia will lend only against 27.3 32.5 assets and not against the potential cash flow of 36.5 sound investments backed byfirmcontracts. 52.7 55.2 The monopoly in banking given to Australia's handful of private and public banks has produced the most conservative banking community in the world. Entrepreneurial banking is foreign to these institutions. They wdl play no ambitious or adventuresome role in the developthe ment of this young nation's massive mineral endowment. Australian companies have to sell off their equity to foreign corporations to get adequate capital to develop these projects. This is how many of the companies to which I have bereferred earlier in my speech have been able to secure such large blocks of equity in valuable coal projects. One wonders what the answer to this problem is. Perhaps it is the opening up of the banking Ucences in Australia ing competition so that some of the smug executives in Australian banks wdl have to get out compete instead ofhaving their business given to Laborgrapes. them on a plate by the provisions of the Banking solutelyGovernment's Act. There is just no point in the Government talking about minimum Australian equity requirements when it knows damn well that poUcies these hopeless institutions in Australia stand in invest the way of a growing level of Australian corporof thisin ate ownership. In conclusion, the Federal Government has bureaucratic mechanism for the control of the inflow of foreign capital into Australian resource industries, that is, the Foreign Investment Review Board. There are in the Treasurer's statement on foreign investment of 1 April 1976be foreign investment criteria to be appUed by the Board on receiving any foreign takeover proposal. These criteria are comprehensive but, as Deputy the role of the Board is only to advise the CabiDeputy Prime net, the Government can veto any takeover by a which is not Labor foreign company. The Fraser Government must inform the Uament and the people of its attitude towards the increasing foreign domination of the coal industry. It is simply not good enough to say that the Foreign Investment Review Board thinks that a particular takeover is a good thing in the national interest or otherwise. The Government must state its position on the issue of foreign interest in coal. It must clearly down separate guidelines for the coal industry see that AustraUans ultimately have a major equity in this industry and are in control of it.",32
87,Mr ANTHONY ,"Richmond-Minister for which National Resources) (12.9)- I have Ustened with disappointed interest to the speech by the honourable member for Blaxland ( Mr Keating). One wonders what motivates him to make such speech. No doubt he is pandering to some of his friends somewhere along the Une within the sociaUst movement. He did not reaUy deUver his speech with much fire and brimstone. There really was not muchfirein his beUy during his speech. It was just a prepared document which obviously he intends to circulate amongst some of his pseudo intellectual friends within the sociaUst movement. It was a rehashing of the sourcesgreat old catchcries about foreign investment, multinationals and oU compames. We have heard it all before.

The Labor Government suffered the consequences of its own sociaUst and its complete incompetence and inability to gain the confidence of the people to and to develop the great coal resources country. Now we are seeing things hapen. Perhaps the motive of the honourable mema er reaUy is to undermine confidence. Perhaps he is trying to be subversive in order to make people rather dubious about investing their money in Australia and to make them think that if ever there is another change of government there wdl the quick implementation of Labor's poUcy of nationalising the coal industiy in this countiy.,33

If it were in government the Labor Party would want complete control and ownership of Australian resources. It would not care how much harm it a did to Australia in the process. Why did we see that sordid and scandalous affair concerned with overseas borrowings? What was the whole motivation of the Labor Party? It was to buy out foreign interests so that it could take complete control of Australian resources and put Australia into hock.

There has no change in the percentage of Australian ownpoint ership as a result of that deal. It has been the Foreign Investment Review Board. What is he complaining about? Is he complaining one foreign company moving in and replacing another foreign company? Then there is the case of the Shell company buying into the Thiess company. That transhis seat. action resulted in an 8 per cent reduction in Australian ownership, from 92 per cent to cent. Is it Australian Labor Party policy that would not allow even 16 per cent foreign ownerLabor ship? Is that what the Labor Party disagrees witli? We want to know, the Australian want to know, the people in the coal industry want to know and the people overseas who want to invest want to know what Labor Party policy is. The trouble with the Labor Party is that it not come out in the open; it will not come clean about it. When we came into office we laid down firm guidelines on foreign investment and takeovers. We estabUshed the Foreign InvestQueensland. ment Review Board which examines all these things. The transactions between the BP and Ciutha companies and the Shell and Thiess com10 panies were approved by the Board after examments ination. There is no room for disagreement. It in the interests of those coal mining get more capital so that they can expand and so that there can be improved working conditions and more opportunities for the people who work in those mines. When talking about New South Wales, why does the honourable member for Blaxland not refer to the visit to Japan just recendy by Premier of that State? He came back and ceeding. preened himself about selling out the New South Wales Electricity Commission mine at Newnes near Lithgow. He sold 49 per cent of it to the Japanese without even offering Australians the opportunity to buy into it.

When it comes to a quid it wiU sell out to anybody, as we have seen in the case people of Mr Wran from New South Wales. Let us look at what is happening. When we came into office we said that we wanted to get development going, following three years in will which not one major project got under way because of the Labor Government's doctrinaire policies. What have we seen? Approval has been given in relation to three big projects in Norwich Park has been cleared. What has happened with the Utah company there? Whereas previously there was only about per cent Australian equity, under the arrangethat we reached with Utah on Norwich is Park the Australian equity was increased from projects to 10 per cent to 20 per cent.",34
104,Mr KEATING ,Bi g deal!,34
105,Mr ANTHONY,"Big deal? What did the Labor Government do? It did absolutely nothing. It did not even get the development of the mine under way. We have increased the Austhe traUan equity in Norwich Park and got it proWe have been able to clear Hail Creek and we have been able to clear Nebo. An Ausmainly traUan company has been able to take up an interest there. We have been able to get the Gregory project under way. AU of these things involve enormous increases in Australian equity. The Tahmoor project in New South Wales now proceeding. These projects represent countless millions of tons of coal. Yet during the of the Labor Government nothing happened. Let me Ulustrate the confidence which developed in the Australian coal mining industry. We all know the difficulties which Japan experiencing in the form of a downturn production and a lack of sales. Japan previously imported a quite high percentage of its coal requirements from the United States. During the years 1974-75 to 1976-77 Japan's imports of coal from the United States have dropped 25 million tons to 17 rnilhon tons, and Australian sales of coal to Japan over that same period increased from 21 million tons to 24.5 million tons.

It will take the credit for the approval of the development of these mines. That development provided is what is making the honourable member so being appUed upset.,35

111,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! The this honourable member for Blaxland will resume seat.,35
112,Mr ANTHONY,The record of the developenterprise ment of the coal mining resources in this country is very impressive. Equity in Utah has been increased. There has been talk of actual Auscause traUan ownership in coal decreasing. because the statistical definition of ownership is measured against actual production. Increased production is largely due to the efforts of Utah which tends to bring down Australian ownership. It is actual production taking place is and not a change of equity in itself. term Opposition members say they do not want foreign capital. How will they get into the business of coal conversion which will require enorhas mous technology and enormous funds?,35
113,is Mr KEATING ,I have just told you-us e the in steel banks. Make them do something.,35
114,Mr ANTHONY,"Does the honourable member want coal conversion? It will take an enormous amount of expertise which we do not have. from At the moment New South Wales-honourabl e members should remember that New South have Wales is a Labor State-Victori a and the Commonwealth have come to an agreement with the proGerman Government and German industrialists to carry out a $3m feasibUity study on coal conto version. If that study proves successful a $50m pdot plant will be established. If this is successful we wdl need a $ 1,300m coal conversion plant for That which German technology and funds will be required. Yet the way Opposition members are talking today is detrimental to encouraging huge overseas to invest in these projects. The MiUmerran coalfield in Queensland lends Foreign interests are inin this coal conversion. Why should we not have foreign investment it meets our equity guidelines which are thoroughly and properly? We want to see 50 per cent Australian ownership. If there is a worthwhUe project in which we cannot get Australian participation but which could go ahead with foreign money, of course we would let it go ahead. We want to see more development, more jobs and more prosperity. We want see more wealth for aU AustraUans. Opposition members are so hidebound by their docphilosophy that they do not care about the circumstances in Australia. They are more concerned with pursumg their philosophy than with looking after the welfare of AustraUans. We know from experience and the long history of country that Australia has done far better his than most of the other countries around the world. Why? It has been run on a private system in which people have been encouraged to come to this country and develop resources. We will continue that philosophy bewe know that it will be the most successful That is for this country. The sort of rubbish we have heard today is viously an exercise for some intellectuals. Those in the coal mining industry who need more capital, who want to replace obsolete equipment and who need to expand find that by taking in overseas partners-in some cases they have only a small interest as I mentioned in respect of the Shell Company moving into Thiess-the y can get new plant and equipment and make operations better for their workmen and coalminers. But the Opposidon would rather keep things retarded. We are making Austraha one of the leading exporters of coal in the world. We are doing that by sensible, practical poUcies without any stupid emotionalism about foreign investment and foreign compames. WhUe this Government keeps control of the situation it will not mind foreign investment in the Australian coal mining industry.",35

116,Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,"Wannon-Prime Minister) (12.25)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Honourable members will recall that on 5 May 1977 I advised the House of certain decisions that the Government had taken in relation to organisation of intelligence and security arrangeobviously ments. Those decisions followed the Governformation. ment's study of one of the reports of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security. One the most importantfindingsof the Royal Comcurity missioner, Mr Justice Hope, was that needs intelUgence of quality, timeliness and relevance and that existing intelUgence assessdepartments, ments do not meet these tests as well as they should. In my statement on 5 May, I said that in the Ught of the Royal Commissioner'sfindings,the Government had decided to introduce legisject lation to estabUsh an Office of National Assessnational ments. This BUl is designed to give effect to Government's decisions in so far as they concern the Office of National Assessments. The Office National Assessments will be a separate statuomic tory authority independent of any department or authority, and it will be free any external direction or control as to contents and conclusions of its reports and ob- assessments. The Office will be concerned with assessing intelligence about international developments and not with domestic situations. The BUl provides that fromtimeto time as circumstances require the Office will make assessments in relation to those international matters which are of national importance. As I mentioned in my statement of 5 May, matters of national importance will be regarded as including: matters affecting the responsibUity of more that one Minister, department or authority or being of a level of importance warranting cabinet reference or being of importance to basic government policy or having major impUcations for the basic premises of departmental pohcy or programs. The Office will not be organised to collect intelligence by clandestine or other means. Those departments, the defence organisation and estabUshed intelligence agencies which at BILL 1977 present collect and collate intelligence wdl continue to fulfil their present functions. Nor will they be precluded from engaging in research, analysis and assessment essential to the disSecond Reading charge of statutory responsibUities, or of functions derived from ministerial responsibUites. The Office will make objective reports and assessments, drawing both on intelligence and on other sources of information and expertise. The Office will avoid comment or advice regardthe ing policy, although its assessments should have relevance to, and assist in, policy The Office will be subjea to policy control and managerial oversight through the of Committee of Ministers on Intelligence and Seassisted by a committee of permanent Australia heads, as I announced on 5 May. The Office will include seconded officers from the defence force and other authorities as well as a permanent core of career officers professionally qualified in the assessment of intelUgence on international developments in the poUtical, strategic and economic fields. Submatters of national interest will include intereconomic as well as international politithe cal and strategic questions. This reflects the Government's concern to have the best possible of intelUgence assessments on matters in the econand resources fields which will be of government increasing relevance. from The Office will be assisted by a National the Assessments Board and an Economic Assessments Board. These boards will be chaired by the director-general and consist of officers from relevant departments who will provide expert comment on the subjects under assesstance. ment. The Government intends that the National Assessments Board will include a senior officer from the Department of Foreign Affairs, senior civilian and the senior military officer from the Joint IntelUgence Organisation and senior officers from the economic departments appropriate. Similarly, the Economic Assessments Board will include senior officers drawn partment of the Treasury or the Deparment Finance, along with officers from the Departadjourned. ment of Foreign Affairs and from other economic departments and the civUian element JIO as appropriate. For both boards, senior officers may also be co-opted, as appropriate, from other departments and authoriues with a contribution to make to the subject under assessment. The Director-General wdl issue reports and assessments from the office of his own authoritymake but wdl, wherever possible.consult the appropriate assessment board before doing so. In the no Mr event of there being a significant difference of opinion in relation to an assessment between Director-General and one of the assessments boards on which agreement cannot be reached, the Director-General will furnish with his assesstions ment a statement on the difference of opinion. The Government intends that the Directorthat General should have access to all relevant inforauthority mation and expert advice necessary for him to make his assessments. The BUl provides that subject to any legal pro-zens visions on the limitation of access to certain categories of information and to compliance with dicated any conditions specified by the Minister, the Director-General shall have access to all continuing Government information and material relevant Government, to a matter being assessed. It has been agreed interest. however, that the Office will not duplicate Capital Territory specialist departmental capabUities existing data banks. As I foreshadowed in my would prepare detaUed interested statement of 5 May, the Government has already taken steps to estabUsh the Office. The first Director-General, Mr R. W. Furlonger, has been appointed by the Executive CouncU and took office last month. Recruitment of staff and estabresidents lishment of support facUities is well advanced and it is expected that the Office can commence producing reports and assessments by the end the year. drawn The Government views the estabUshment of this Office as an event of considerable imporIt is a step towards implementing some of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security. Decisions on the the other recommendations will be taken and announced in the course of the current session of ParUament. The availability to the Government asof objective assessments on matters of external concern to Australia should greatly assist the determination of poUcies and priorities in the whole fieldof our external relations. I commend from the Dethe BUl to the House. of Debate (on motion by Mr E. G. Whitlam) of CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY Ministerial Statement",36
117,Mr STALEY ,"Chisholm-Minister for the Capital Territory)- I table a paper entided 'Proposals for the Constitutional Development of the Australian Capital Territory' and seek leave to a statement relating to the same matter. SPEAKER-Is leave granted? There being objection, leave is granted.",37
118,Mr STALEY,"In a pubUc statement dated 6 October 1976 I indicated that the Government had decided that legislative and executive funcwould be delegated to the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly. I said then the Government envisaged the delegation of for a significant portion of the Australian Capital Territory territorial and local government functions and recognised the democraticrightof Australian Capital Territory cititaking to be involved in the making of laws and the of decisions which affected them. I also inthose that the Government would identify functions which should be reserved as the responsibUity of the Commonwealth such as functions relating to the national interest or the seat of government I indicated that the Department of the in close co-ordination and coincluding operation with other departments cial and adrrunistrative anangementstheforfinanproposals on submission to Government and that the Government would ensure that the proposals would be up available to Australian Capital Territory before the next Assembly election. In accordance with the undertaking made in ofOctober 1976 the Government has now decided to release a proposal for the constitutional development of the Australian Capital Territory with the objective of encouraging widespread pubhc examination and comment on the issues prior to a final decision being made. The protutional posals are being announced now so that interested groups and the pubhc will have plenty oftimeto debate them. The issues involve matbUity ters of signiiiance and complexity and, in ance with the best principles governing legislatAssembly ive pohcy development of such a nature, it proper that they should be placed before the pubhc so that they can be adequately examined and, if need be, reassessed in the Ught of Assembly and community views. There are now over 200,000 people Uving in Canberra and it is reasonable to expect that they would want take part in a system of legislative and managethose ment controls affecting their daUy Uves. Last June I announced that the next Assembly election, scheduled for September 1977, would be deferred. Because of the importance of proposals to the people of the Territory, the of the present Assembly will be extended until not later than 31 December 1978 to aUow fuU pubhc debate of the proposals. The exact date the election wiU be announced later. I am unable to give afirmcommitment on the tuning of a final decision on any handover of powers functions. All the views expressed sidered before a final decision is made. The objective is to have the matter setded before next Assembly election. After considering ous reports on constitutional development in Australian Capital Territory the Government dicated last year that there should not be any piecemeal delegation of functions. Under the E iroposals now released it is envisaged that legisnational ative and executive responsibUity for a nificant portion of territorial activities wiU be transferred in one step to an elected Assembly. The Commonwealth, however, would retain resources control of matters affecting the national interest or the seat of government interest. The proposals are designed to encourage facilitate active and effective citizen participation in the democratic processes of lawmaking and administration while at the sametimerecognisCapital ing the importance of the continuing role of Commonwealth ParUament and die Governance ment in maintaining the standing and importake tance of Canbena as the national capital and seat of government of Australia. The proposals envisage the delegation of wide pohcy and executive responsibUity for important functions such as health, education and welfare services, pubUc transport, the Australian Capital Territory graduaUy. pohce, municipal services, the present government housing operations and many other services of government in the Territory. The constiposition of the Territory as the seat of government and national capital does not aUow the Commonwealth to divest itself of responsifor the government of the Territory. What accordis proposed is a delegation of powers to an and not the creation of a State. Under is the proposals the Governor General in CouncU would have a reserve power to refuse assent to Assembly ordinances and the ParUament would retain the power of disallowance of ordinances. In recognition of Canberra's unique position as the national capital the proposals indicate that to die Commonwealth would retain control of areas of administration which have a direct impact on the national capital role of the city. Because of this the National Capital Development Commission would not be brought under Assembly control although procedures would be the devised for greater community and Assembly term involvement m the planning and development of Canberra. To preserve the present integrated land management system in the Territory, all of land administration functions would also be retained by the Commonwealth. National institutions such as the Australian War Memorial and or the Art Gallery would remain Commonwealth wdl be conresponsibUities. the The proposed allocation of responsibiUty bevaritween the Commonwealth and the Assembly is the spelt out in detail in the paper which I have intabled. The allocation reflects therightsand responsibilities of democratic participation in local territorial affairs and safeguards the interest in the seat of government and sigthe national capital. Therightto make democratic decisions in territorial affairs will entaU responsibUity to contribute a proper share of to the level of standards and services in Canberra. Under the proposals thefinancialarrangements for Commonwealth assistance to territorial activities would require negotiations on a and regular basis between the Commonwealth and the elected Assembly with critical appraisal of expenditure levels. In recent years Australian Territory municipal costs and locally the produced revenues have been brought into balwith only Umited government subvention to account of national capital characteristics. It should be expected that the Government would be looking to the same general processes of refinement in high expenditure areas here including education, welfare and health. This refinement would be achieved responsibly and In accordance with the Government's federalsame ism pohcy it would be expected also that increases in levels of services and new initiatives would be funded from territorial sources of revenue. States apply charges such as estate, probate and succession duties, lottery and ing taxes, stamp duties of different kinds, tobacco and other licence fees and charges for services, registrations and the like. Such sources revenue would need to be considered by the them. Assembly. The question of tax sharing and subventions would also be one for negotiation. I have already had preliminary discussions with all members of the existing Legislative Assembly and with local senators and members of the say House of Representatives. These discussions have concerned the principles of the proposed handover of powers and functions and during Minister: the period of pubhc debate I expect that broad outline will be filled in with all the necessraises ary detail. To date there has been a most pleasis ing degree of bipartisan support for the broad proposals among members of this Parliament and among members of the Legislative Assemthat bly of the Australian Capital Territory. There would be a need for members of the present Assembly to co-operate with the Government and Commonwealth departments in the prepation aration of legislation, the machinery of adminisUkely tration and the financial arrangements to ensure a smooth and efficient transfer of powers and functions. Departmental officers would be avaUthe able to assist the Assembly and provide advice and expertise. I repeat that the objective in announcing proposals now is to stimulate pubUc debate the issues and to ensure that the views and make opinions of all those with an interest in the posals can be put forward and considered in totaUty before final decisions are made. I present the following paper: Constitutional Development of the Australian Capital Territoiy-Ministeria l Statement, 15September 1977. Motion (by Mr Eric Robinson) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",37
119,Mr BRYANT ,"WUls) (12.40)-We of course fore have had placed before us something which is rather more a problem than I think a solution. make no reflection upon the present Minister for the Capital Territory ( Mr Staley) in that regard. think that we are facing one of the more intracother table problems of government-the relationship between local situations and national situations. Nobody has found a solution. Australia is in conIt sistent and continual trouble about it. The traUan Capital Territory will find itself in the situation. In Britain long-established communities are in great trouble because they want to have some sort of autonomy. Papua New Guinea faces the same difficulty. I am therefore gift, prepared to agree with the objective that the gamMinister has outlined. I am not certain that I agree with the proposals. I know that he does not put them before us with a view that we should of agree with them but that we should examine The Minister's statement carried the optimistic note that we would have the matter settled. Surely from the Australian experience we would that anything to do with constitutions and the relationships between the various levels of government will never be settled. So I say to the 'It is a good statement but is it about a the good solution?' I notice that new federaUsm its multifaceted head. I think the problem in some ways impossible of solution. But one of the great difficulties in facing governmental questions here, and I suppose everywhere else, is we are more likely to concentrate on structural rather than functional solutions. Instead of looking at the function which we want to perform, making that the objective of the considerand then producing the functions, we are to take existing functions and get on with the job offittingpeople and institutions to them. I think that the problem of relationships between Australian people through their government and ParUament here or the local people of Canberra through their Assembly wdl still remain unresolved. So aU I ask is that whatever solutions the we finally come up with, whatever laws we on finally pass through this ParUament, we do not any inflexible rules. It is surely a lesson to proall AustaUans that a written Constitution, with the great difficulty of changing it, is poison to progress. I hope we will avoid that in the Austrahan Capital Territory. During my period as the Minister in charge of the Australian Capital Territory I hoped that we would evolve the situation that gradually the Legislative Assembly would recognise that the authority and opportunity that was placed beit had real substance. One thing that always bothered me was the way in which it continually I demanded to know what were its powers. I suppose, to use the vernacular, one would say: 'Your I powers are whatever you can get away with'. In words, you produce the legislation and it passes through the system. The Legislative Assembly is in the same position as we are here. is always possible that the Senate or the High AusCourt will declare invaUd whatever we do and veto it. There are very few institutions that have total autonomy in the sense that the Assembly wanted it defined. I suppose that in a sense the Legislative Assembly was a body of my own creation. I with make that rather modest assumption before I litde leave the town. The Assembly appears never have appreciated the power that lay before it. There is an immense body of law in the trahan Capital Territory. I think that 150 or ordinances are listed which cover almost every area of human endeavour. I used to say to the Assembly-and I presume the present Minister for the Capital Territory has said so too-'Yo make the laws about those things and if they transgress the national pohcies as we see them we have not only a right but also a duty to amend that them, send them back or veto them'. I suppose it is unfortunate that when we created the Assembly we did not give it adequate drafting faculties. I accept some responsibility for that. suppose our Government has to accept some rein sponsibihty. But we all have to admit that was difficulty in getting adequate drafting staff Austraha. This was one of the difficulties faced as a government of change. I take it that the present Government has faced the same difficulty in trying to change our decisions back again. I think that this is an area of expertise the law to which we will have to give more attenit tion. The Assembly always seemed to react by assuming that the initiative lay with the Minister and the Department. It is my regret that so far the Assembly has not shown much more energy and initiative in that regard. Members of the Assembly, because of the parttimenature of their position, lack the necessary time in which perform their duties. I suppose that the most siggreat nificant piece of legislation to flow from the membership of the Assembly was the projected law on consumer affairs introduced by Ms Kelly. There may have been other legislation of which am unaware. This brings me to the issue of the membership of the Assembly. I think we can make a case for fulltimemembership. I was so sure of that three years ago, but the more I of government, the more I see of the necessity strengthen the representative contribution government of this country, the more I am conthe vinced that that is something we will have to face. Mr Sainsbury-It costs money.",39
120,Mr BRYANT,"Eveiytbing, I suppose, costs ing money. But money is the measure not so much of what the cost will be but of one's capacity ply facilities. The honourable member costs money. I do not regret that and we will keep paying this money until the next election. In a community such as this the cost of a legislative assembly is a relatively marginal one compared the total cost of the city. I think that cost is of significance. It is a question of input. By putto ting in more representative people we might reduce the necessity for other pubhc officials. AusSome 18 members of the Assembly would be more administering a city of some 200,000 people. This is nearly half the population of Tasmania. We should bear in mind the number of representatives, or misrepresentatives, we get from Tasu mania. There are 15 in this Parliament as well as representatives in the Tasmanian Parliament and on all the local councils. I am not suggesting Tasmania does not need all these people. I have come to the conclusion, again out of a great deal of experience first as a member and then as a Minister in this Parliament, that we need many I more directly representative people taking a part effective government and government control.",40
121,there Mr HODGMAN ,"Min d you, we colonised Vicin toria. Had it not been for Tasmania there would that we have been no Victoria.",40
122,Mr BRYANT,"I think that the honourable member is deadright.I think there should be no in greater reflection on Tasmania than the fact that produced the present Victorian Government obviously by it colonisation program. The problem in respect of Canberra is that the 18 people elected to the Legislative Assembly have other work to do. We must ask whether membership should be on a fulltimebasis. If we do-and this point was made in the Minister's statement-w e to would exclude from government many people of talent and capacity to serve this city. There may well be a case for some part time and some full time members. This is a decision that could be made by the Assembly itself according to the I functions it sees it ought to carry out. I do not think in these circumstances that a membership of 18 is enough. It is time we did not what we wanted to do in thefirstinstance, see namely, divide the Australian Capital Territory to into four orfiveelectorates with three to five to members to be elected from each electorate on basis of proportional representation. Under such a system we might end up with an assembly consisting of about 20 or 30 people. I suggest that this area should be examined. I cannot overstress the importance of the representative function. I think that in a consideration of these matters we are often too bound by both precedent and existsituations. to supOne of my other disappointments during my time as Minister was that the Assembly did not take up the right it had as a result of the power given to it for its members to have an effective say in respect of authorities. I was disappointed when Mr Gordon Walsh retired from the reserved Assembly and from the Australian Capital Terriwhen tory MUk Authority that another member of Assembly did not take over chairmanship of Authority. I beUeve that we are faced with the questions of rninisterial authority in government and the whole system hi which we are cast. I think that we are a Uttle obsessed with the manthese aging director concept of Ministers. In fact Minister is not just the managing director, he the whole board of directors. There should be more involvement in the poUtical input in relathat tion to these matters, just as there is in some other countries. Britain is a case although I do not think the Ministers there act as teams aU thetime.Here we have a multitude authorities and the Legislative Assembly ought to be the chairman and ought to have a more effective say in direction. My view was that there should have been continuous evolution of local government Canberra along the Une of total input rather an attempt to define it by ordinance and adminAssembly, istrativefiat.I do not agree with the deferment the election of the Legislative Assembly. I do think there wdl be any advantage in having the present members of the Legislative Assembly volved in these deliberations. That could be done by the newly elected members. I can understand why the Liberal members of the Legislative Assembly would not want the election to be held. I presume that they would have visited upon them the wrath of the citizens of this area bepartment cause of the disadvantages imposed on them this Government-althoug h not always by the present Minister for the Capital Territory, course.",40
123,Mr HODGMAN ,Your Mr VaUee is a great help to the Liberal Party.,41
124,Mr SPEAKER,"Order! I point out that if the honourable member for Denison wishes to ject, and that is out of order, he should return his seat. He is out of order on two counts in jecting from some other honourable member's seat.",41
125,Mr BRYANT,"I am glad that there is such a large audience here at present. I point out honourable members the difficulty in which the Governmentfindsitself, or the Minister himself, in attempting to define the areas which ought to be regarded as national responsibilities and those which ought to be local responsibUito ties. Most of us would agree, although membersation of the Legislative Assembly may not, that control of land ought to be reserved to the national body; but why should the matter of hoUdays be to the national body? I remember that I was the responsible Minister I granted a the number of holidays in the Australian Capital the Territory which brought down on my innocent head the wrath of the local employers. However, I think that the matter of holidays ought to be a local affair. But what is the difference between things? Why are unit tides and long service the leave reserved to the national body when other is things are to be transferred? I put these things forward for consideration, not with a suggestion they be decided one way or the other but to show the very great difficulty we face in trying to in point, make a decision about them. of Is the role of this ParUament adequate? The Governor General in CouncU, that is the Ministry or the Executive CouncU, will be able to veto decisions. The reasons will be tabled here, but will we then be able to disallow the veto? I hope a that we will examine the legislation in that in respect when it comes forward. As for the than replacement of members of the Legislative I think we should use the Tasmanian of system and not have nomination by the parties. I not think that both the system that we use for the Senate and the one that is to be used for the inLegislative Assembly constitute a denial of the representative principle. I do not think people ought to be able to sit in representative bodies unless they are actuaUy direct representatives. I am not too sure that the abohtion of the Deof the Capital Territory is wise. My exby perience after examining government bodies throughout Australia as a member of the House of of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation is that we need some overall authority or functional unit which can bring everything into focus. One of the great disabUities of nearly every area of Australia is the dispersal of functions through authorities interwhich do not need to co-operate with one to another. For instance, I disagreed with the transinterfer of the Commonwealth car service to the Department of Administrative Services-no t because I have any grudge against that Department but because I felt that this was a departure from the principle that we ought to be trying to to support-that functions which concern people and areas ought to be integrated as nearly as finds possible into some co-operating force. In the city of Canberra we have an opportunity create an administrative and executive operwhich will be an example to the rest of Australia. We only have to look at the manageyears ment of Melbourne and Sydney to see how Territory. difficult it is to get any sense out of the whole system. I think that that transfer was a backward step. I think that the dispersal of the Department of the Capital Territory will be a backward step.",41
126,Mr STALEY ,"But in a way it will bring things together, will it not?",42
127,Mr BRYANT,"Some of the responsibUities will be dispersed to some other Minister who not bother much about them because he will simply have 45 other things to do. I have several fears which I would like to express. One is that financing provisions will be such that they willand start to cause atrophy in this city. The citizens will have a much heavier burden to bear into keep up the standard of the Australian Capital Territory. I foresee the deadening hand of the Treasurer coming into it. On think that part time membership of the Legislative Assembly will mean that its members have enoughtimeto apply themselves to the job. The Minister responsible willfindthe Legislative Assembly on the edge of his duties and therefore we willfindthat many things will flow back and the place will become just another bureaucratic enclave. The Minister having brought the matter here utes and having initiated discussion, the time come for us to try to get the community to think Uttle more constructively about it. I hope that some of the thoughts expressed here and in other place about the Australian Capital Terripare tory can be put out in such a way that the citizens will start to think a Uttle more constructively about this matter. If we are not careful we will end up in a situation of confrontation. people will be for it and others will be against it, and somebody will have to make a decision to which, with the hindsight of history, probably will be the wrong decision.",42
128,Mr SPEAKER,Order! The honourable back gentleman'stimehas expired.,42
129,Mr DONALD CAMERON ,"Griffith) may (12.56)- Mr Speaker, on looking at the Constiif tution Ifindthat section 125 refers to the estabassure Ushment of a capital territory no closer than miles from Sydney. If one looks back to our history onefindsthat the only reason the AusGovernment traUan Capital Territory was established was satisfy the jealousies which existed between Vicpiece. toria and New South Wales. It was agreed that this Territory would be established to meet the needs or rather whims of those 2 States. We havetralians seen the Territory grow in its splendour over and today we have aflourishingcity and Previously in this House I have proposed the concept of changing section 125 of the Constitution in order that the Australian Capital Territory might be placed back in New South Wales. I have a veryfirmview about this, a view which has been commended by people in almost every State, namely, that there is no need whatsoever to keep up a duplication of the bureaucracy and will the forms of government that are necessary to look after the needs of only a quarter of a million people. Everywhere I go in Australia, the except in New South Wales, people come to me say: 'I agree with your formula for the Australian Capital Territory'. People in New South orderWales come to me and say: 'What have we done wrong?' New South Wales is the only State that is opposed to the idea; the rest are totaUy in the other hand, I favour of it. wdl not We talk about cutting down government expenditure, and I believe that we can start right here in Canberra. There is absolutely no need for a smaU population to have its own parUamentary system and a dupUcation of government departments when the Government of New South Wales, only four hours away by road or 30 minby air, could do the job most adequately. In Canberra we are splurging the pubUc purse to has pander to the whims of a handful of people. a People in Canberra know that this is where the lucky country is. When we see the way that the the people of Canberra are looked after and comthe facUities here with the facUities that the rest of Australia has to suffer, there is Uttle wonder that the people of Canbena want to Some retain their selfish litde nest. I notice that it is nearly one o'clock, but I want register here once and for all my total opposition to any concept of government for the Australian Capital Territory other than thrusting it into New South Wales whence it come and allowing it to stand on its own feet with the rest. I can understand that the people of the Territory be a Utde nervous about what might happen Mr Wran became their Premier, but let me them that the foundations of Canberra 100 have been so well laid and the city has been so early well planned that now not even a Labor State could destroy it. It is here. Let us to call an end to the charade. We have' our showI beUeve that it is time the Capital Territory was put back into New South Wales and the people in this area were treated like other Ausand not accorded the special treatment the they command under the present system.

134,Mr NIXON,"I thank the House. It is also sigWales nificant that our provision for new projects year is the first allocation for new works under the Urban Pubhc Transport Agreement since the 1974 budget. Although $5m is a relatively minor amount I believe that its allocation is a clear indication of the commitment this Government has to ensure urban public transport services upgraded. However, the apportionment of the $5m for new projects was not an easy task. Consequendy, I sought from my State colleagues their views on possible allocations. In all cases there was an overwhelming priority given to the acquisition of rolling stock.

As honourable members will appreciate these funds are not payable in relation to particular projects until cost are justified in accordance with clause the Agreement. Consequently it is not possible this stage to advise Parliament of the ultimate allocation of these funds. Whilst many projects are yet to befinishedwe are already seeing the benefits from those that have been completed. a number of cities, for example, it is now not usual to see people allow older rolling stock to pass so that they can catch the new bus, train tram that is following.

137,Mr NIXON ,"Gippsland-Minister for 16 (3) of Transport) (2.21 ) - I move: at That the Bill be now read a second ume. The main purpose of this BUl is to provide financial assistance by way of section 96 nonIn repayable advances to the States for road unconstruction and maintenance over the three financial years 1977-78 to 1979-80 inclusive. The or BUl is a major item of legislation and involves a number of fairly complex issues. I have therefore arranged to have circulated to all members an by explanatory memorandum outUning the main PubUc principles of the legislation. As honourable members will know, the Commonwealth has made assistance avaUable to the roads by way of non-repayable adfor a great many years. For the 3-year 30 June this year, assistance was to the States for roads purposes under Roads Act and Roads Grants Act. passage of the BUl now before the the States Grants (Roads Interim Assistance) Act 1977 was passed in the autumn session cover advances to the States for the first three 1977-78 1977-78 equal to one-quarter of the allocation. The legislation the interim assistof the ance arrangements. of - The legislation now before the House provides a basic grant in each of the three years of $475m. The States have been advised of the Government's intention to maintain the basic grant to each State for 1978-79 and 1979-80 at amount equivalent in real terms to 1977-78. State's share of the indexed total grant will, of course, remain constant. The Government is proposing to give effect to this intention by adjusting the basic grant to allow for cost ments on an annual basis in Une with movementswealth in the nauonal accounts' implicit price deflator for private investment in 'other buUding and finance construcuon*. This adjustment may be varied on account special factors which cannot presendy be forehighways seen or which may not be adequately reflected the proposed index. DetaUs of this particular aspect are to be finalised in discussion with the States. These discussions will also be useful of course in helping to avoid any misunderstandin ings about the indexation arrangements. Generport ally I would not anticipate any drastic alterations to the adjustments derived by use of the price deflator proposed and the overall effect of the proposed arrangements will be a substantial basic guarantee to the States. Furthermore, I must also point out to the House that the proposed indexation arrangements will provide a guaranteed nunimum. As the States already know through advice from the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Commonwealth's commitment is to provide funds at least equivalent in real terms to the 1977-78 allouse cations. The actual increase each year will need to befinalisedin the Ught of the overall budget-the ary and economic situation. Total funds to be appropriated for roads will be $ 1,425m, an increase of almost $200m the grants provided in the triennium just ended.Transport This is a very substantial effort on the part Government and it signifies our determination stay with our proper responsibUities with regard to Australia's road network. It is a particularly significant effort on our part when considered the Ught of overaU budgetary problems. The to Government recognises the importance adequate transport networks for the economic well-being of Australia and I should comment passing that in addition to our funding for purposes we also have substantial commitments in relation to other transport modes which we discharging responsibly. Honourable members will probably be aware that at the February meeting of the Australian Transport Advisory CouncU I announced that the Government intended to make $475m avaUable for road grants in 1977-78. At thattimeI also announced a number of significant pohcy initiatives on the part of the Commonwealth Government with prove regard to the areas in which we propose to centrate ourfinancialassistance. In particular, announced that the Commonwealth Governmore ment intended to ensure that its funds were avaUable for use by local authorities in such move-way and to such an extent that the CommonGovernment could not in the future be held out as responsible for inadequate road at this level. It was also made clear in the aUocations which I proposed to the Australian Transport Advisory CouncU that we were of committed to continue funding for the national network and the main rural arterial innetwork, which is of course a key part of the inter-regional and inter-urban transport system. This re-direction of Commonwealth effort was part based on recognition of the fact that supfor urban arterial roads in the legislation just ended had, in our view, taken an excessive part of the total avaUable Commonwealth funds. In fact, we informed the State Governments that we were not prepared to continue providing a major part of funds for the construction of urban freeways at the expense of other road works. We are not abandoning urban transport as is evidenced by our decision to provide a further $5lm to the States under the urban transport agreement in 1977-78. We recognise that in the cities a balanced approach to transport, including the of pubhc transport, is essential and we are pursuing vigorously with the State governments problems which are faced in developing and improving these systems for the future. Honourable members should also be aware that since our return to office we have held detaUed and exabovetended discussions through the Australian Advisory Council with the object of of theeliminating unnecessary complexity and to intrusion on our part in the affairs of State governments in relation to transport matters. This is, of course, part of our wider approach in in the development of a federaUsm pohcy designed avoid the many areas of friction which characof terised our predecessor's arrangements. in I should comment that the allocations for roads1977-78 which are proposed in this BUl, also reflect to an extent, requests from State Ministers arefor changes to allocations which I proposed to them at the Australian Transport Advisory CouncU. The allocations which I am proposing in the schedules to the BUl to cover 1978-79 and 1979-80 will maintain the new thrust of Commonwealth funding to which I have already referred. However, the legislation will continue to contain provisions which will enable me to aprequests from the States for transfers becon-tween road categories, to meet for example, I changes in State road works priorities. FurtherI should make it quite clear to the House madethat the BUl does not aUocate the additional a indexation funds for 1978-79 and 1979-80 to particular road categories. Obviously the Parlianote ment will in due course be asked to appropriate these extra funds and their allocation to the ous road categories within each State. I would now like to draw the attention of honourable members to the main features of this Bill. Firsdy, in the interest of simplified adminisline tration the legislation is being presented as Bill instead of two separate Acts similar to those which were in force up to 30 June last. State Min-substituting isters have welcomed this feature. In addition there will in future be no difference in the cial administration for national roads as pared with other road categories since pro rata advances will be made to the-States for all road categories on a monthly basis. The present separusing atefinancialarrangements in respect of national highways will be discontinued. The Bill also vides that the only Ministers with administrative responsibilities will be the Minister for Transport and the Treasurer. Of particular interest is our decision that the new legislation will continue the change Federal-State introduced recendy whereby payroll tax may be included as an eligible item of expenditure both from the Commonwealth grants and as a complarming ponent of matching State quotas. This is consistcapable ent with the approach adopted in relation to Commonwealth grants in some other programs. The road categories which are specified in legislation are as follows: National highways construction; national highways maintenance; national commerce road construction; rural arterial road construction; rural struction and maintenance; urban arterial road construction; urban local road construction; and Minor Traffic Engineering and Road Safety Improvements Program. Honourable members will be aware that these categories are similar to those of the previous legislation. There is, however, no longer a separstandard ate reference in the legislation to beef roads developmental roads although beef roads will continue to be eligible for assistance. The category export and major commercial roads has been replaced by the category national combackground merce roads. The legislation will provide for State quotas of matching expenditure. The States are required to find from their own resources minimum amount of roads expenditure in order to qualify for the Commonwealth funds. I wish to stress that this provides only a base below whichtions State roads expenditure cannot fall. It does not any way limit total State road expenditure. fact honourable members should be aware that in recent years New South Wales has heavily roads exceeded its State quota. It is also important to that under this legislation the States remain free to allocate their own funds to roads in acvaricordance with their own priorities. The legislation also provides for a minimum quota each year for all States combined of $418.8m. It is intended to index the individual State quotas in with any increases in the Commonwealth one grant. The Commonwealth sees the road funds that it provides as supplementing rather than for State finance. On this basis, we consider it reasonable that increases in the Comfinan-monwealth grant ought to be matched by comincreases in the matching State quotas. The legislation continues to provide for the annual submission of programs'to be carried out Commonwealth funds for the approval of the Commonwealth Minister. In the case of local proroads a program of allocations for road works can be submitted as an alternative to a program of projects. On the basis of discussions and agreement with State Ministers I have included in the Bill provision for the establishment ofjoint planning committees as a possible alternative to the system of program approval. Initially this provision can be used to establish committees for national roads but is of being used for other road categories if desired and agreed. It will be a matter for agreement between individual State Ministers and the the Commonwealth Minister as to whether planning committees are to be adopted at all. In each case the conditions under which the alternative approach is adopted will be a matter for agreement local road conbetween Ministers. This legislation, unlike the previous legislation brought in by our predecessors, will not require the submission of all programs for urban arterials no matter how they are funded. The final feature of this Bill which I should draw to the attention of the House is the inclusion of a information clause. This information or clause is intended to enable the collection of information consistent with Commonwealth purposes under the legislation. It does not permit wholesale intrusion into State affairs. Against this honourable members should note it is my intention to continue to work with State governments on a co-operative and federal basis. a The explanatory notes I have circulated describe the main feature of the Bill and I would not therefore propose to deal with individual secin any detail. The important points for in members to note are that Parts II and III of the In Bill contain the clauses necessary for program approval and payment of grants for nauonal and other roads respectively. Part I sets out the usual definitions. Part IV specifies the general administrative machinery, appropriation clauses, provisions for reports, informadon and audit certification and so on. The schedules provide details of allocations to individual road categories within each State for each of the three years based on $475m. Quota details are also included in the schedules. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned. CUSTOMS TARIFF (COAL EXPORT DUTY) AMENDMENT BILL 1977 Bill presented by Mr Howard, and read a first time.",45
138,Mr HOWARD ,"Bennelong-Minister for Special Trade Negotiations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister) (2.36)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second dme. The purpose of the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Amendment Bill 1977 now before the have House is to reduce the export duty on high qualquarter ity coking coal from $4.50 to $3 per tonne and other coking coal from $1.50 to $1 per tonne. Honourable members will recall that these changes were foreshadowed by my colleague the Treasurer ( Mr Lynch) in his Budget Speech on 16 August 1977 and that, following Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Proposals were introduced to authorise collection of duty the reduced rates with effect from 8 o'clock that evening. The reductions proposed by this enactment represent a further step by the Government towards achieving the intention stated in 1976 of phasing out the export duty on time. coal over three years. It is the Government's intention to remove the remaining duty next year in accordance with the undertaking to which I have referred. I commend the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL Bill presented by Mr Howard, and read a first time.",48
139,Mr HOWARD ,"Bennelong-Minister for dation Special Trade Negotiations and Minister Assistof ing the Prime Minister) (2.38)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Excise TariffAmendment 1977 is to enact excise tariff alterations introduced into this House on 16 August 1977 Excise TariffProposals Nos 1 and 2. Clause 4 the Bill increases the rate of excise duty on from 4.3c to 10c per tonne, with effect from 1 July 1977 in accordance with a notice pursuant to section 160B of the Excise Act 1901 published in the Gazette of 30 June 1977. The total excise duty collected on coal is apphed to the Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave Fund estabUshed under the States Grants (Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave) Act 1949 administered by my colleague the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and the increase proposed is necessary to preserve the viability of the Fund. Clause 5 of the BUl, in conjunction with clause 3 and the Schedule, proposes enactment of the alterations in excise duty foreshadowed by my colleague the Treasurer Second Reading ( Mr Lynch) in his Budget Speech on 16 August 1977 and which were set out in Excise Tariff Proposal No. 2 introduced into the ParUament later that evening to authorise collection at the altered rates with effect from the time of the announcement. The alterations proposed, which are set out in detaU in notes on clauses which been circulated, provide for increases of a of a cent per litre on refined petroleum on products and 50 per cent on crude oil and condensate, with the exception of condensate marketed separately from crude oU. The BUl proposes, in relation to such condensate, the total removal of the present duty of 1.26c per Utre. I that speech, commend the BUl. at Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned. Bill for NON-GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS (LOANS GUARANTEE) BILL 1977 BUl received from the Senate, and read a first Second Reading",48
140,Mr VINER ,"Stirhng-Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister assisting the Treasurer) Morris) adjourned. (2.40)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. 1977 The purpose of the BUl is to implement a scheme to enable the Commonwealth to act as a guarantor for loans raised by non-government schools in the States to finance wholly or partially the Second Reading construction of approved priority school facUities. The Government accepted the recommenof the Schools Commission that a system loan guarantees be established and in November of last year, the Minister for Education (Senator Carrick) announced this decision Bill and foreshadowed the introduction of the necessary enabling legislation. The scheme will by have considerable benefit for non-government of schools in that it wiU allow loans for buUding coal projects to a maximum of $ 10m in any one year to be backed by Commonwealth Government guarantees. The scheme will provide muchneeded support for those schools wishing to raise loans especially those without institutional backing. In addition it will permit more favourable borrowing terms to be negotiated. Loan guarantees will also be available for projects which while approved in principle by the Commonwealth may not receive a grant. The Bill includes provision for the Commonwealth to recover any cost to it in the event of default. This scheme foster increased building activity in nongovernment schools in the States. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned. NEW GENERATION LOCAL TELEPHONE SWITCHING EQUIPMENT company. Ministerial Statement",48
141,Mr ERIC ROBINSON ,"MCPherson-Minisrequire ter for Post and Telecommunications)-by general leave-Australia n telephone subscribers are rently served by a network of over Unes of automatic switching equipment; 1.3 rnilhon Unes of this equipment are electromechanical and were installed in the period 1939-62. In order to obtain worthwhUe economthe ies in operation and, at the sametime,provide customers with new facUities and to meet dehave mands it is necessary for Telecom Australia embark on a program of equipment however modernisation. The first part of this modernisation program will commence next year by upgrading the existwithin ing system with a limited form of computer trol. The second part of the program is the tion of a new electronic switching system for use from about 1980. To this end, ders for suitable equipment closed in July 1975; seven tenders were received. In mid 1976 Telecom announced that it had narrowed the equipment selection down to two tenders, one from L. M. Ericsson (Australia) Ltd for an AXE system and the other from STC (Australia) Pty Ltd for its IOC equipment. Some 20,000 man-hours of technical evaluation of two systems resulted in the Australian Telecomequipment. munications Commission recommending the AXE system offered by L. M. Ericsson (Australia) Pty Ltd as the most suitable system for introduction into the Australian network in the 1980s. This system capitalises on recent adcontinue vances in computer and electronics technologies. It wiU be cheaper to buy, to install and to tain than if Telecom continued with the present system. It will be an important factor in containing cost increases and thus prices to the user in the years ahead. Savings over the first ten year period are estimated to be in excess of $100m at current prices. In addition, the new equipment will enable a range of additional facUities to be introduced progressively. The contract with L. M. Ericsson will require a high proportion of will Australian manufacture, reaching at least 80 per cent as volume increases. The contract wiU also provide for manufacture under Ucence. The introduction of the stored program control equipment and its adaptation to work with the Australian network will be a substantial engineering undertaking for both Telecom and the In adopting an SPC local exchange system Australia is in line with the general trend around the world. While the equipment will less staff to install and maintain, the growth in telecommunication services is curstrong and Telecom's technical labour force 4.5 milUon should continue to grow. In chosing between the two main competitive systems the overall employment consequences in telecommumcations industry were of concern to the Government. Both STC and L. M. Ericsson established facUities for switching equipto ment production in Australia. The Government is convinced that while it may be necessary for some readjustment in staffing levels between STC and L. M. Ericsson there will be no overall adverse impact on employment the industry as a result of the decision. In conterms of total factory production employment, adopcompany staff are more dependent on overaU Telecom orders than on the choice of a particular world-wide tennew switching system. In the period 1977 to 1985 orders for telephone switching equipment which include the STC 10C trunk equipment and the first deUveries of SPC local equipment are expected to be worth Pty about $700m at current prices. STC manufactures crossbar equipment under Ucence and is the sole 10C trunk supplier. L. M. Ericsson on the the other hand is the prime suppUer for crossbar On this basis therefore even with the SPC local equipment being awarded to L. M. Ericsson, total switching equipment orders are expected to at a comparable level until at least the mid 1980s. Beyond 1985 it can be expected that mainSPC local switching equipment will be made under Ucence by a second manufacturer. STC are already manufacturing electronic trunk switching equipment and could quite possibly be able Ucensee of the local SPC local system. The Commission beUeves that the introduction of the SPC local equipment offers significant cost savings and itsflexibditywUl give customers improved services. The Commission views the future with optimism. Demand seems assured. There is a sound network and a well quaUfied staff. Promising new technology holds an advanthat tageous prospect of additional services together with the important cost features. The new equipthat ment should enable the Commission to restrain increasing costs below those experienced by community in general.

145,Mr WENTWORTH ,I understand that the motion that the House take note of the paper has been moved already.,50
146,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,No. The Minister employment has not moved that the House take note of the from paper. Mr Charles Jones-The Government is in charge of the House. If the Minister wants to move that the House take note of the paper that would suit me. I could take it up from there.,50
147,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,"If it is the wish of the a suitHouse and if the honourable member for Newcasde ( Mr Charles Jones) is agreeable, I move: That the House take note of the paper.",50
148,Mr CHARLES JONES ,"Newcastle) (2.50)- I do not know what is to happen at this stage now that the Minister for Post and Telecommunications ( Mr Eric Robinson) has moved the House take note of the paper. The usual procedure once that motion has been moved is the matter is placed on the Notice Paper. But as the honourable member for MackeUar ( Mr the Wentworth) and probably the honourable member for Adelaide ( Mr Hurford) are to speak on this matter, I do not know whether we are going to have a full scale debate on it. We on this side of the House received the appropriate two hours notice that the statement was going to be made. I do not think any honourable member would expect us at this stage to the make a decision as to whether the Opposition of will support the proposal, oppose it or remain neutral to it, bearing in mind that the Minister's advisers have spent some 20,000 man hours on the technical evaluation of the two systems. We on this side of the House have had a Utde over two hours in which to look at the paper. In fact, the reason why I was late coming into the House for the Minister's presentation of his statement was that our Committee was looking at the paper for with two of the advisers which the Minister provided to confer with us. So we have just reached the stage of getting a preUminary rundown of the statement is all about and it is a little difficult to indicate where we are going. From reading the Minister's statement and It from the hour I had with his two technical this morning, the system that has been stateselected appears- I emphasise that word 'appears'-to be a more effective system than the alternative system which was put up by STC (Australia) Pty Ltd. Problems are associated with this proposal. Men's employment is involved. The appropriate telecommunications unions are concerned for, as the Minister has correctly said, this new equipment wiU be easier to install and easier to maintain also and in the long term it will affect a little thing called employment. So, as far as the men are concerned, their is at stake. All I have is an assurance the departmental engineer that no one wdl be displaced. I hope that the Minister will give the men in the Australian Telecommunications Commission an assurance that whichever of the two systems is introduced-the Ericsson system or the STC tem-non e of the men who are presently employed in the technical side of Telecom will displaced as a result of the introducuon of that system. If the men are told that there is not going to be a mammoth lay-off, either now or in the future, that at least will have the effect of allaying some of their fears. On reading the paper it is obvious that there will not be any monstrous overnight change. think the paper talks in terms of spending $ on new equipment by 1980. That amount of $1.3m is not going to have one heck of an effect on employment. We are talking in terms of long debate now. term changes between now and, say, 1990. The Minister nods his head. I do not want in. Mr Eric Robinson-That is quiteright;there will be no effect on employment at all.",50
149,Mr CHARLES JONES,"The Minister has just interjected to indicate effect on employment at all. I thank him interjection, which he is not permitted to make. member Mr Eric Robinson- I was trying to be helpful.",51
150,Mr CHARLES JONES,"So the position is adjourned'. that those fellows in Telecom can at least to some degree have their fears allayed as there is not going to be a very substantial lay-off in that tion of Telecom. A Sydney-Melbourne confrontation is developing now as to whether die Ericsson system is going to be manufactured in Melbourne whether the STC system is going to be manufacdesirable tured in Sydney. I have been informed by the partmental technical people that the newspaper reports which state that $500m worth of equipconduct ment is to be suppUed are not true. The Minister has not indicated this in his statement, but I that he will indicate just how much really is volved. It has been suggested to me that we talking about the manufacture of about $200m worth of equipment-no t $500m worth, as has researched. been mentioned in the Press. So, if the Minister can make a statement in that regard it will at least clear up the matter. From what the Minister has said in his statement and from the advice that I have received, I House beUeve that the work is to be shared. If STC had honourable been awarded the original contract, Ericsson his remarks at would have been given portion of the equipment to budd. Now that Ericsson has been awarded the contract, portion of the equipment likewise to be constructed in the Sydney factory of STC. Plessey Austraha Pty Ltd or some of the other sysmanufacturers of this equipment in Australia also could be given some of the work. be I know that other members desire to speak on this statement. In view of the fact that my party is still conferring on this matter and that we have no possible hope of making a decision on it in a couple of hours, I feel that it might be appropriate at this stage ifi were to seek leave to continue my remarks at some latertimeand if the debate I were adjourned. That would aUow the honour1.3m able member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) to take part in the debate at some later stage.",51
151,Mr WENTWORTH ,"No , I want to come into the",51
152,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Mr Lucock)Order! The question before the House in that event would be that the honourable member for Newcastle be given leave to continue his remarks later.,51
153,Mr WENTWORTH ,I do not give leave. I desire to that it will have no speak now.,51
154,Mr CHARLES JONES,"The honourable for MackeUar has a notice of motion on this matter on the Notice Paper. In that event, I would move: 'That the debate be now",51
155,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,"Unfortunately, the secStanding Orders state that one dissenting voice prevents the honourable member from obtaining leave to continue his remarks at a later time. This is not a matter on which the House votes. or Mr Eric Robinson- Mr Deputy Speaker, it is that the House be run in an orderly demanner. The honourable member for Newcasde has been quite co-operative in relation to the of the debate, as he has explained to the House. Officers of Telecom Australia were made hope avaUable to him today. I want to hear any cominments that the Opposition has to make about this are contract. There is no need for a division of opinion on it. The matter has been thoroughly I will not be a party to preventing the honourable member for Newcastle, if he wishes to make a statement concerning this matter later when he and his party have had more time to consider it, from doing so.",51

164,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,"Mr Lucock)-I were point out to the honourable member for Lang at this point of time the honourable member this for Mackellar is speaking to a motion which is before the House. To deny the honourable member for Mackellar therightto make comments, though they do parallel a notice of motion the that he has on the Notice Paper, would be to debate at this stage on this subject matter. that Therefore the honourable member for Mackellar for Newis free to continue his remarks. Mr WENTWORTH As I said, I do not wish go into the technical matters at all. I am in the matter of Australian content. I am interested not only in what will happen in 1985 but also in the possible retention in Australia of the design skills in relation to this a sort of equipment. When a team which has such skills is built up, it is important that it be maintained. I am not trying to take sides with STC against Ericsson or with Ericsson against STC. All I am asking is that adequate consideration be given to this matter because the design teams are important. However, there is another matter to be conAlready there has been enough trouble we the fragmentation of the motor to have, as a consequence of this of the electronics the House take industry in Austraha? Mr Stewart- I raise a point of order, Mr Notice Speaker. Again I draw your attention to of Motion No. 29.1 cannot see anything the statement made by the Minister which allows the honourable member for Mackellar to the subject matter of his Notice of 29. All the remarks he has made so you to towards Notice of Motion rule on that, Mr Deputy",52
165,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,"I was just looking the statement of the Minister, which is fairly I point out to the honourable member for Mackellar that he must direct his remarks to the statement made by the Minister, because it is that statement to which the motion before House refers.",52
166,Mr WENTWORTH,That is precisely what I am doing. In awarding this contract it is imporsee tant that we look at the future of the industry as a employed whole. I am not supportmg STC (Australia) Pty the Ltd against L. M. Ericsson (Austraha) Pty Ltd or which Ericsson against STC. I beUeve that the Government has considered these matters. I ask the Government to put before the House the way which it has considered them. It is important for the future that we should avoid the fragmentation of the electronics industry in Australia the same way as the motor industry has been come to order. fragmented by the operation of too many competing factors. In his statement the Minister tioned the possibility of the SPC local switchingof equipment being made under Ucence by a secondcriticise manufacturer. Mr Stewart-It took you a longtimeto wake up to the fragmentation of the motor industry.,53
167,Mr WENTWORTH,"WU1 the honourable near member for Lang be quiet for a moment? He is saying absolutely nothing and he knows it. Mr Stewart-No, not when you are being so hypocritical. The fragmentation of the motor industry was all done whUe you were in government.",53
168,Mr WENTWORTH,I am not trying to what attack or defend anybody hi this regard. AU I asking is that the Government show given due consideration to this matter. It be very wrong if the future of the Australian tronics industry as a whole was jeopardised undue fragmentation. Surely if honourable members opposite have any regard for tions Australia's secondary industry and if they are not just trying to make cheap poUtical points at expense they will be sUent and give me some support. All I am trying to do is get the maximum employment for Australian workmen and designers and see that the future of the Australian electronics industry is properly cent safeguarded. I am not saying that the Government has not already done this. I am not criticis Mr ing the Government's decision. All I am asking is out. that the Government put before the House the reasons for this decision. We should be able to see in its proper perspective how this decision into the long term objectives of maintaining efficiency of Australia's secondary industry and maintaining the maximum employment in honourable Australia of local workmen and designers. This is not an unreasonable thing to ask. should have thought that in place of this kind niggling objection the Opposition would have the been on side with us. Opposition members should not try to make cheap poUtical points. I am trying to do what they should be doing and that as many AustraUans as possible are here now and in the future and that structure of Australia's secondary industry is as efficient as possible. Is this something on Opposition members want to take points of order? in Mr Stewart-This is a death bed confession.,53

I am not saying that I know anything about the technology of this matter. I do not. But I know two things. First, in awarding this contract proper attention should be given to the Australian content now and in the future. Secondly, we should be looking to the long term efficiency of Australian secondary industry. These are not the only things to be looked at but it is important that appropriate attention be paid to them. I beUeve that the Government has done this but I would Uke to hear a statement from the Government as to it has done. Unfortunately, that is not am included in the statement which the Minister has that it has put before us today.",53
171,Mr KING ,Wimmera) (3.10)- I would have elecbeen quite happy to have had this debate adby journed but with the honourable member for MackeUar ( Mr Wentworth)firinga few quesat the Government I feel that we should discuss it a Uttle further. I remind the honourable its member of this simple and straightforward sentence in the statement by the Minister for Post and Telecommunications ( Mr Eric Robinson): The contract with L. M. Ericsson will require a high proportion of Australian manufacture reaching at least 80 per as volume increases. Wentworth-But when? This is not spelt,53
172,Mr KING,"It would be impossible for any Minister to spell out what he was going to do this fitsyear or next year. The Government has accepted the a very important and large tender. No doubt time will soon sort out the point about which the member for Mackellar is so terribly worried. I am not worried. I take this opportunity I of congratulating the Government and the Minof ister in particular for reaching a decision to implement a new scheme that wiU be of great benefit to Australian subscribers over the next few years. My interpretation of this decision is that only will it improve the standard of the equipresources ment that is so necessary in Australia but it also help with the cost WhUst we are talking about $500m in one sense I think that the initial cost will be much lower. There is no fear that will be a load on the taxpayers. Rather it will an advantage to the taxpayers. I was a Uttle cerned to hear the honourable member for Newis castle ( Mr Charles Jones) say that there would be a confrontation between Sydney and Melconcerned bourne as to where aU this equipment will be manufactured. Perhaps there is always an arguOnly ment about whether a new factory should be put in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide or anywhere else. The all important fact is that a decision been made by the Government. I feel that and whether the equipment is manufactured in Sydthese ney, Melbourne or Adelaide does not mean a tiling. The important thing is that with the acvival ceptance of this contract, sooner or later we be employing approximately 800 people. That the information supplied to me on this subject. We ought to commend the Government rather than criticise it. I have ho hesitation in saying that once the people reaUse what the Government is doing this field it will help considerably. One could at some length about the problems within Australian Telecommunications Commission. do not think I ought to take up thetimeof the House to do that at this stage. Perhaps on other occasion I shall explain the problems within Telecom. I certainly support the motion before the House. Debate (on-motion by Mr Hurford) conducts adjourned.

173,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE ,"D a w so n ) over a (3.14)-When I was speaking last Tuesday I said that I would devote some of my speech to aspects of energy within this country. A saying I remembered for many years is that it is against the natural law of God that we should waste that which he has given us. The energy situation today within Australia and throughout the is evidence that we are wasting what has naturally given to us by our creator. Australia for many years seen various emphases placed on the development of energy generaUy either not through nationalisation, the private sector, local or overseas resources. The former wdl Labor Government would have chosen nationalisation against aU other methods. The discussion on the matter of pubUc importance today indithis cated that that is precisely the nature of Oppobe sition flunking on the energy situation, our conresources and many other things in Australia. It a theme to which I certainly cannot subscribe. An energy resource pohcy has normally been with the type of fuel that Australia has in abundance-coal , uranium and solar energy. now does the policy recognise, through the present Budget, the major crisis that confronts Australia in its desperately short reserves of oU. has The emphasis that is placed on coal, uranium solar resources as fuel faUs to recognise that suffer mainly from developing and marketing problems. OU supply is necessary for the surof our rural and transport industries and of will the people in this ParUament today. We need is look only at Canberra itself for ample evidence that the impUcations of die crisis have as yet not been appreciated by AustraUans. The consumption of oU for heating instead of the use of electricity; the use of diesel in our raUways instead of in steam or electrification; the use of private talk ttansport mainly carrying solo passengers in the preference to community transport are all I examples of the contempt with which all AustraUans, not only Canberrans, treat this critical some subject. Out of every 100 cars used on Canberra's roads and streets each morning at, say, 8.30 a.m. only about five would multiple carry. This is possibly the same throughout aU the major cities of Australia, yet our pubUc transport its business at substantial losses through lack of patronage. There is little appreciation for the fact that in Second Reading Australia the oU industry is in a crisis situation. (Budget Debate) AustraUans must now address themselves to this crisis. The Budget does this through one of the alternatives, that is, in its pohcy to allow Australian crude oU toriseto world parity prices. Stark reality is that the price of petrol wtil rise period by 1 lc per gallon. This is an inevitable consequence of the crisis we now face. The effects will be two-fold. Firstly, it will provide an nave encouragement to further exploration and development. I believe that, coupled with this, have been the incentives of the 1976-77 Budget through taxation measures and the attitude world adopted by this Government only recently been towards the North West Shelf development. has Some people forget that this encouragement through taxation has already been given within the framework of the previous Budget. The seclife time. ond effect is a drive towards conservation through the higher price to be paid for fuel the consumer where alternatives in electricity available more cheaply, and also through a sensible and sensitive approach to the proper useEven of all our oil based products. I was pleased to note as a further indication this Government's recognition of the problem, the assistance by the Government to the researchcost and development of the Pritchard steam power unit: Early assistance in the assembly and conthis struction of the engine in the Commonwealth factory at Bendigo recently produced results the delivery of the engine. In this regard I must pay tribute to the previous Labor Government our which gave its permission and authority for the production of the three engines necessary. It the present Government that carried the development forward and produced this particuUnited lar engine. The Pritchard steam power unit is well recognised for its non-pollutant qualities. One wonders today whether, where we see the tremendous expense put on to the motor car manufacturers and eventually passed on to the The consumers for devices to prevent pollution, resulting in the lower consumption of fuel car, we should automatically turn to these children. alternatives. Within the framework of the Budget some $100,000 have been set aside for further development of the Pritchard steam power unit. Only yesterday an ill-informed person wrote the Canberra Times commenting upon that of engine. I agree with him in one respect, namely, that it is absolutely necessary that we as Government and as a people should research this type of alternative. I agree with him in that but he fails to appreciate the situation and position taken by the Government to grant $100,000 in conjunction with the Victorian Government to further this form of research cause this is the way we should be looking. If engine can use such alternatives as derivatives of sugar cane, the plant cassava or even natural gas-a n item which we export in great quantitiesgreed at the moment but which we do not make use of in this country where we have an oil shortage- Imon sense. am amazed that we are not getting behind this project more thoroughly. The Granting of the $100,000 is proof that the Government is interested in researching power units such as that can use alternative power to that produced from oil. More assistance in research is needed we are to cope with the eventual crunch when comes. Clearly the crunch will come within our The Prime Minister's comments in last week's by Canberra Times that Austraha is taking positive are and planned steps to improve its energy techmorenology must be welcomed by all Australians. if we are genuine in our efforts, certain freedoms that we have had in the past and the present high standards of living we enjoy will ofhave to be sacrificed to some extent. The estimated rise in the price of petrol will be at a to every individual and corporation in Austraha. The belt will have to betightened,and will be thefirstnotch. It demands that unless we become greater producers of other natural in. assets we as a Government and as a people will have to transferfinancialresources from some of priority areas-thes e could well be in the welfare sectors-toward s greater costs of the basic was fuel research and development of and providing for alternatives. A discipline imposed in the States of America m the height of its fuel crisis recently to reduce the speed of automobiles on the highways effected a 20 per cent saving in amount of fuel used. As a by-benefit it also reduced the death toll by a similar 20 per cent. reality of the crisis is there. Either we face up to the reahty of the situation now or we leave a per terrible legacy to our children and grandThe evidence of the disaster fronting us is all too real. The most developed nation in the world today, the United States of America, earher this year as a result of a crisis in its energy production in and supply could not prevent the deaths of many its citizens in the coldest snap experienced in that nation in recent times. In this day and age a when we can send a vehicle to the moon we have not the resources to guarantee warmth, mobility and Ufe to our people on earth. However, I fail to the appreciate why, whilst this problem was firmly recognised and the pohcy developed, the further and corresponding problem of unequal fuel costs bethroughout Austraha was not grasped with the thissame determination. The extreme situation of discount fuel in capital cities, actually encouraging waste, has been allowed to continue. The of people and industry has never been so obvious as is evidenced by this affront to comThe other extreme of where fuel is an essential requirement and for which there is no substitute or subsidies is in our rural industries. Since thisLabor's withdrawal of the petrol price equaUsation scheme rationing has been compulsorily if forced on people in outback Australia by price itdifferences of some magnitude. At some places in Queensland I believe the price is as high as $2 a gallon at the moment compared with the normal price of about 80c a gallon on the eastern seaboard. If ever there was an opportunity to stop capital city extravagances and abuse and to assist rural outback Austraha, it was at the same dme as announcing a change to world parity prices. We could have examined the discounting situation and the equalisation of costs of fuel, or at least we could have decreased the difference in the country prices as was the case before equalisation was withdrawn by the Labor Government. What existed before should now be reimplemented. It could have been done at litde cost to the capital city dwellers if the discount abuse had been corrected at the same time. If city people see any injustice in the fuel equalisation scheme they live in a fool's paradise.",54
174,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Mr Jarman)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,56
175,Mr HURFORD ,"Adelaide) (3.24)-It is my job as the Opposition's shadow Treasurer to analyse the Budget as an economic document The Fraser Government's pohcies are built on three false prernises and each of the three partly explains this bad Budget wbich we are debating this afternoon. The first is the 'short, sharp shock' thesis. When this has not worked it has been converted into the 'extended shock' thesis or the 'let's have an extended recession with greater and greater unemployment' approach. The false Liberal and National Country Party belief is that this is the only way to reduce tion, and that reducing inflation is the sine qua non-the without which nothing-of economic recovery. The second false premise which explains so many wrong decisions of the past 21 months is that it is necessary to reduce real wages of men and women of Australia, the real living standards of Australian people, in order to transfer more profits to the business, particularly the corporate sector-whic h to them, wrongly, is another sine qua non of economic recovery. The third false premise of the conservatives which explains so much is what I describe as the 'bastardised-Friedmanite' theory. It follows false thinking that there is some magic medicine in cutting the supply of money to a dangerously low level. Not even Friedman and his Chicagoite school of economists pursue this false philosophy with the ideological dedication of the Fraser Government. Let me turn to the tragic results of following these three disastrous premises this Budget and by the past economic performance of the Fraser Government. Remember that the first premise is the need to create that shock-which , when it did not work, has become the extended shock. The main criticism levelled by me and my colleagues at last year's Budget was that it was too contractionary. The great fear was that the initial stages of recovery evident in early 1976 would be choked off by heavy handed government action. These fears appear to have been well grounded, as the decline in economic activity in 1977 illustrates. The high level of economic activity in 1976 occuned when the economy was predominantly under the influence of the last Labor Budget, known as the Hayden Budget. The Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) himself has given credit for economic performance in early 1976 to that Budget. During an interview on the Australian Broadcasting Commission current affairs program Four Corners of 18 December 1976 he said: Look, you've got to remember that in the first part of this year, you were still operating under the Hayden Budget, and under Labor policies, and quite obviously it would take some ume for those policies to change. It did take some time for those pohcies to change; and when they did as a result of the first Lynch Budget and of earlier economic actions the economy began a further decline. There are a number of means of measuring the impact a budget will have on an economy. One of these is the calculation of the full employment budget position. Using the fact that in a recession inflagovernment expenditure automatically rises through increased welfare payments, and receipts fall through lower tax receipts, calculations are made to obtain what the budgetary position of present expenditure and receipt patterns would be at the position of full employment. I and other members of the Opposition have repeatedly asked the Treasurer ( Mr Lynch) to supply us with an estimate of last year's Budget's full employment position. The Treasurer has always refused arguing that such a calculation is of dubious worth. This is despite the fact that in the United States of America such the an estimate is made automatically and is used extensively in discussions on budget pohcy. Now the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development through the report of a group of independent experts headed by Professor Paul MCCracken has endorsed the use of the full employment budget concept. I know some Government supporters have noted that I have questions on notice of the Treasurer at the presenttimeon as illustrated in this very subject The MCCracken report entitled 'Towards Full Employment and Pnce Stability' is an in-depth expected. study of economic policy in OECD countries in recent years. The summary of the report, in cussion of the impact of budgetary pohcy and the need for planning, states that the members of the Committee 'endorse the ideas underlying approaches made along these Unes in several countries, for example, the concepts of the full employment surplus (United States), the tral budget' (Germany) and structural budget pohcy (Netherlands)'. The Treasurer in the past has been fond of expressing satisfaction with the way his Government was carrying out his Unfortunately interpretation of OECD pohcies. The ment of full employment budget calculations by the MCCracken Committee is very difficult to misinterpret. The only reason the Government can have for not publishing such calculations that it is afraid of admitting just how contracmoderate tionary its Budget pohcy has been. I refer not only to last year's Budget but to this<year's Budget as well. Here comes the crunch. The growth Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research at Melbourne University has made calexceed culations for the full employment position of 1976-77 Budget. That Institute assumed that realistic level of unemployment at a high level economic activity would be 2 per cent. Using this basic assumption it found that the 1976-77 ings Budget was in modest surplus at full employmean ment. This means that it found that the $2.8 billion deficit was entirely a function of the extension of recession. The pubhc sector was not being used to pump up the level of economic acenough tivity. Initial calculations on the full employmentsavings. position of this year's Budget reveal a substanresults tially higher full employment surplus than last year. This means that budgetary pohcy is being actively used to withdraw resources from the vate sector and hence slowdown economic being activity. Professor John Neville of the University of New South Wales gave a paper last year on another single figure measurement of the impact of budget pohcy. This measurement is termed the budget impulse. Using one particular form the budget impulse calculation, Professor tax Neville found that last year's Budget represented a much greater contraction of the direction of fiscal pohcy than any budget in recent history. PreUminary estimates indicate that the 1977-78 Budget wtil have a further substantial contracchances tionary impact. One measure is obvious from these complex calculations: Budget pohcy has been highly restrictive and with hindsight the renewed downturn of early 1977 was only to be Despite the fact that this Budget predicts Uttle a disimprovement in unemployment or inflation I consider that the forecasts in Statement No. 2 are overly optimistic. There is every reason to the assume that the contractionary impact the Government'sfirstBudget had on the economy will be repeated with this the second Budget. Ac'neucording to the Budget national income is expected to grow by about 4 per cent over the course of thisfinancialyear-that is from the June quarter of 1977 to the June quarter of 1978. it is very difficult to identify the endorsesource of this expected growth. Private consumption expenditure which accounts for some 60 per cent of national income is is expected to show moderate growth this year. A increase in consumption was also expected last financial year. The actual increase was 1.7 per cent. If this year's so-called moderate in consumption is the same as last year's, it seems inconceivable that income growth will the 1.3 per cent achieved over the course the of 1976-77. Nothing put foward by the Governa ment suggests that there will be any substantial of increase in consumption. Indeed on the Government's own admission real average weekly earnare Ukely to fall over 1977-78. This can only that people will have less to spend, thus reducing the total demand for goods and services. It is unlikely with inflation and unemployment still high that consumers wtil feel confident to reduce substantially the level of thenThis supposition is supported by the of a survey of consumer sentiment conducted by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research. The Institute prifound that 'Measures to reduce real incomes are reflected in consumer attitudes'. The constant harping from the Government on the need to reduce real wages can only reinforce the tendency of consumers to save rather than spend. In the short term there is likely to be a fall in consumption. With the rebate system in operation tax refunds are much lower this year. Personal income wtil not receive the boost it usuaUy of does at this time of the year. Consequendy the refund buying spree is not Ukely to be of any significance. With expenditure cuts having an immediate impact, the prospect of early contraction is far from remote. This wtil further dampen confidence and further reduce the already slim of significant stimulous from the all February tax changes. A number of recent surveys have demonstrated that the great majority of taxpayers, in the face ofrisinguncertainty about the future, are unlikely to increase sumer spending even with substantial income cuts. The announced changes, which heavily favour the better-off, are more likely to lead higher savings or expenditure on imported luxurLast ies and overseas travel with Uttle resultant impact on domestic activity in this country. The Government expects private investment to be a substantial source of growth in this finanexpected cial year. Litde explanation is given for this mism. Indeed, with falUng demand, high stocks and already substantial excess capacity in manurespond facturing industry, there appears htde incentive for increased investment in expanding prolower ductive capacity. The ratio of private stocks to non-farm product is at its highest level since 1974, thus reflecting the faUure of consumer dethe mand to Uve up to business expectations. Hence stock building is unlikely to add to growth. The added impost of a rise in company tax rates is unlikely to engender the confidence the private sector will need before it will expand.the Investment in the niining industry will probably increase but as this form of investment accounts for less than 1 per cent of non-farm gross national product, its overall effect will minimal. The home buUding industry is expected by the Government to be another area of substantial growth. This forecast already has had doubt cast upon it by the Australian Housing Association and other parts of the industry itself. In a ment accompanying their 1976-77 annual per report, the directors of Jennings Industries Australia's largest home butider, criticised the Federal Government for 'faUing to provide measures in the Budget to lift the current level activity in the budding industry'. The directors further pointed out that, without selective stimulus, unemployment would continue to increase and pubUc confidence-a n important element in the functioning of the private housing sectortion would decline. Further evidence of a bleak table. future for the buUding industry comes from the latest ANZ Bank Survey of Construction tivity, pubhshed just 2 weeks before the Budget. A survey of 336 members of the Master Builders Federation of Australia and the Australian eration of Construction Contractors reported tight profit margins, depressed levels of activity,the a surplus of unemployed labour and tough comlocal petition for the inadequate supply of avaUable contracts. The Government assumes that an sustainable improvement in the balance of payments will contribute to growth. However, some slowing down in the rate of growth in major industrial concountries is evident this year, so demand for tax exports may not grow substantiaUy. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics actuaUy has forecast to an 8 per cent fall in the value of rural exports. financial year rural exports accounted for some 44 per cent of total exports. An 8 per cent drop in almost half of our exports will leave a lot of making up to be done before exports can be to make a substantial positive contribuopti-tion. The value of imports may, however, continue torise.Imports have taken a long time to to devaluation, suggesting that perhaps the price elasticity of demand from imports is than expected. In other words, consumers still prefer imported goods, even at higher prices. All this suggests that a further deterioration in current account deficit is quite possible, making a forecast of growth derived from the overincome seas sector very suspect indeed. I turn now to another of the theories on which Fraser Government's poUcy is based. I have said already that I do not beUeve that the Budget will Uve up to expectations in relation to growth. I have Ulustrated this from the point of view of be consumer demand, investment decisions demand and the overseas sector. What I have called the Friedmanite theory also has to be related to this Budget. I am bound to say that if monetary pohcy, as oudined in the Budget, is followed it wtil, as happened last year, severely hamstring any possibUity of recovery. The stateannounced target of money supply growth of 8 cent to 10 per cent is far below the prediction Ltd, for nominal money income growth of around 15 per cent. There is every evidence to suggest that, as in the last 12 months,tightmonetary pohcy of will have a greater effect on retarding growth than on restraining price increases. The Government has made much recently of the prospect of faUing interest rates. The reducin the deficit is supposed to make that ineviHowever, this proposition ignores reatity. In spite of the cut in the deficit, the total pubhc Acsector borrowing requirement has not been reduced. The drop in the total borrowing program for the Commonwealth Budget and nonFedBudget sectors from $3,025m to $2,960m has been more than offset by ariseof over $300m in borrowings of State, semi-government and government authorities. The real situation is that the pubhc sector will be out to borrow more than it did last year. This means that no drop in interest rates is possible within the confines of the Government's restrictive monetary targets. Any interest rate drop in the next Government loan must be regarded as a sheer gimmick, unless the monetary growth targets are eased. The State governments, to their credit, are forcing a reduction in interest rates. But let us be clear: This means that the money supply growth targets announced in the Budget are meaningless. Hopefully, this is so. From what I have just outlined, it is more than possible that consumers, investors and the overseas sector will add nothing to real income growth in 1977-78. In this situation the foolishtively, ness of further cuts in the real level of governunit ment oudays is even clearer-especiall cuts predominantly fall in those capital works areas which have the greatest stimulatory effect on the economy. Far from getting the 4 per growth in non-farm product predicted over the course of this financial year, it appears that will be fortunate if there is any growth. The bourne Institute's forecast of growth from June to June of about 1 per cent, or close to last year's level, looks even optimistic. Such a performance by the economy would see the prediction of Government's adviser, Professor Warren tragedy. Hogan, of unemployment of 8 per cent, or almost 500,000 people become a reality in early 1978. The tragedy of all this is that the extended shock thesis which I mentioned in opening my Budget debate remarks is not working. This patently financial year, 1977-78, will be the third year succession during which prices have risen by something of the order of 12 per cent. In other words, we still have inflation. In the same 3-year period unemployment will haverisenby somemodest where between 100,000 and 200,000 nificantly, most of thatrisehas occurred or will occur during the period when the major thrust pohcy has been towards lowering the inflation rate. Given these unhappy facts, there is reason to question the assumption made by the Government that present policies will sigmake nificantly lower the rate of price increases. said earher, it has been the cornerstone Government pohcy that inflation had to be beaten before sustainable recovery was possible. Any suggestion that recovery itself would be effective means of combating inflation has been ridiculed by the Government. We of the Oppotion, sition ignore that theory altogether. More and more evidence is gathering that the Government is not right, and never has been right, in using its 'suffer now so that we prosper later' approach. It is very easy on present policies to see the economy being locked into annual inflation rates of 10 per cent to 12 cent, even at very subdued levels of activity. Indeed, one of the Government's own council economic advisers, Professor Whitehead, forecast this last week. In many instances, the excess capacity and lack of demand in Austrahan industry is acting as a stimulus to price increases rather than as a deterrent. Firms in a monopoly or oligopoly situation will continue to keep profit levels up in the face of flagging demand. Obviously, if their costs are spread across lower than E otential output, the price per unit of output will ave to be higher to sustain profit levels. Alternaif demand and output were torisethen costs would fall and the necessity for price y as the rises would decline. The problem is a classic one of the Governcent ment applying market control forces where plainly the market is not functioning as expected. we Restrictive policies have well and truly met the Melpoint of fast diminishing returns. The Government's refusal to use the pubhc sector to create employment, or to aid in the restructuring of industry, or indeed to reduce inflation by reducthe ing unit costs by encouraging output, is a In fact, one of the major negative contributions this Government has made to economic debate in Austraha has been its propaganda which aims at discrediting any suggestions of the value of public sector stimulus or the adoption of a more rational monetary policy. It is absurd to suggest that there is no scope in for stimulatory fiscal pohcy at the moment. There is scope. The general consensus of the discussions on economic pohcy the week before last at the ANZAAS Conference was that a policy of stimulus was not only possible but also and, signecessary or essential. of This is the basic difference between the short term approaches to the economy of the Governevery ment and the Opposition. There is not a difference of degree, as some have attempted to out. There is a fundamental difference of As I approach. A Labor government would be comof mitted to a program under which all pohcy instruments would be directed towards using recovery to assist in overcoming inflationary an pressures. At present when the Government's arms of pohcy are all working in the one direcwhich is not very often, they are designed to purge inflation from the system by dehberately restraining activity. For the Government, no recovery is to be facilitated before inflation reaches acceptable levels. As indicated earlier, may there are good reasons to beheve that this method will not work and, even if it did, the costs to the community are too high to pay. The only per common ground between the Opposition and the Government on economic pohcy is a recognition of that inflation has to be reduced.",56
176,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Mr Jarman)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,60
177,Mr FALCONER ,"Casey) (3.44)-This is a Budget of economic realism, expenditure restraint, taxadon reform and human concern. It is a Budget of economic realism because it offers prospects of a further reduction in the rate of inflauon and some real economic growth for the second year in a row. It offers the prospect of an increase in employment of 2 per cent leading to some reduction in unemployment. It offers the prospect of an increase in business investment spending and a gradual reduction in interest rates. I was interested to read recently an economic forecast by W. D. Scott and Co. Pty Ltd, management consultants, a forecast pubhshed shortly after the Budget and deUvered by J. B. Donovan, the company's chief economist, at W.D.Scott scott economic forecasting conferences held during August. The forecast states: . . . It is feasible to predict a great deal about the upper and lower limits to the rate of inflation through the rest of 1977 and 1978. This is because the future for several of the factors that influence inflation viz., after the effects of the November 1976 devaluation (net) are fully absorbed in be expected that inflation of import and export prices will settle in the 6 per cent to 7 per cent p.a. range through 1978 (OECD and WDS estimates); from the announcements in the 1977-78 budget, including the little heeded proviso that the 8 per cent to 10 per cent channel of money supply growth will be flexible if necessary, it appears that the behaviour of the monetary aggregates will be consistent with a falling rate of inflation. as the Budget deficit is lower this financial year than last, the governments new borrowing program is less, the need for official maintenance of our high interest rates is vastly weakened and interest rates should be fallingsomewhat. It concludes: In respect of their influence, money supply and interest rates bold the prospect of reduction in the inflation rate. This assessment agrees that expenditure restraint is important in defeating inflation. WhUst it is superficiaUy attractive to beUeve that we can spend our way out of trouble, as honourable members opposite beUeve and as the honourable member for Adelaide ( Mr Hurford) just seemed to suggest, the bUl has to be paid by someone sometime.That bdl is paid by the inexorable cycle of rising inflation, rising taxation and rising unemployment, as happened during the famUy. Whidam years. I mentioned earUer that this was a Budget taxation reform. The new standard rate taxation system means that 90 per cent of taxpayers wtil be on a standard rate of marginal tax of 32c for every extra doUar earned. Steeply increasing rates of marginal tax have been a disincentive not only to the high income earners but also to the average wage earner wanting to earn extra overtime as well as to the small businessman wanting to take additional risks for the prospect of additional reward. The Government's tax reforms are laudable but there is one high priority area which must be given attention in the next stage of taxation reform. I refer to the relative disadvantage of the single income family where one parent works and the other looks after the home and the family. Where many famUies now have two bread winners the single income family feels under great pressure to bring a second income into the farnily to maintain a comparable standard of Uving. I am not objecting to both parents working nor am I wishing to justify the hoary old statement that a woman's place is in the home. What I am saying is that there ought to be a genuine choice about whether both parents work or only one works. is already fairly well charted, WhUst the two income famUy contributes to increased national productivity it also adds to the the annual rate figures, it can commumty costs in some important respects. The absence of both parents from the home leads to increased demands for chUd care facUities and welfare services which are provided as a matter of course in the traditional one income family. I am finding increased concern in my electorate that present taxation and family allowance provisions do not give significant acknowledgement of the social and economic role performed by the full-time home maker. The family allowance system introduced last year was a significant social reform but many of the social welfare activists in our community have not given sufficient credit to export and import prices, the the Government for that reform. It put additional funds into the hands of large low income famUies where the help was most needed, but in a period of inflation when prices and wages are still rising, when taxes are subject to indexation and social security pensions are indexed, the relative values of those famUy allowances declines. Quite apart from dealing with this problem of the declining value of family alat lowances, the Government-indeed , the whole Parliament-shoul d consider ways of conecting the relative disadvantage of the single income It could be done by a variety of taxation mechanisms or by the provision of an allowance of for a full-time home maker added to the present famtiy aUowance system. I would Uke to see greater debate on such alternative proposals. There is one vital area which this Budget has given support to the family under stress. It reflects the human concern expressed Budget for high priority areas of need. I the extension of the handicapped child's allowUnions ance. The Government is conscious of the additional costs that can be incurred handicapped child at home. At present low year the ACTU income families may not be eligible for the Australian maritime handicapped child's allowance because their the bans on the ChUean child does not satisfy the medical criteria severely handicapped child. This can lead to partion and have continued the that ticular hardship. The Government in this has now decided to extend eligibility for the blatantly political use of industrial action.of handicapped child's allowance. The Director General of Social Services, at his discretion, will plain be able to grant a handicapped child's allowance was of up to $15 a week to a person on low income Wriedt, who has the custody, care and control of a substantially handicapped child who at present does not fully meet the medical criteria. I wish to turn now to a matter of vital importance to the export industries of Australia, ticularly our primary industries. Australia has developed as a great trading nation and anything cott which damages the performance of our export imposed in protest industries damages the ability of our economy to atrocities in East Timor. recover fully. A number of union bans and boywere imposed no Indonesian cotts are preventing the shipment of trahan export cargoes and are resulting in the Indonesianflagvessels designedthis loss of vital export markets. In a period when trade have been launched. I am further many Austrahan industries have become uncompetitive in world markets because of our inflathat tionary cost pressures of the Whitlam years, it is a meet tragedy that export industries able to compete internationally are pered by capricious and often politically flour. The market is seen as oneof motivated industrial action. Some bans on potential in the future. That market iseven exports and the servicing of overseas vessels are based on ideological objections to the pohtical complexion of overseas governments or to actions that those governments have taken. Other bans are used to support restrictive work Government practices by Australian unions. A prime example of the first based on ideological objections to another government-is the ban on cargo bound for Chile. Due to a ban by the Waterside Workers tioned, Federation imposed in 1974 on exports to Chtie, cargo cannot be marked or manifested through for Chile. Consequently there have been no wheat shipments from Australia to Chile since August 1974. The Waterside Workers Federried ation of Austraha and maritime unions have imposed these bans in protest against the poUtimany cal complexion of the ChUean Government and its poUcies. There is not even the sUghtest pretence that these bans are related to any genuine in the industrial issue. refer to In 1974 the Australian CouncU of Trade Executive endorsed the bans. However, in caring for a following Board and approaches by the Australian Wheat ChUean interests, in February of this resolved to recommend that and waterfront unions Uft wheat trade. The unions for a concerned refused to accept bans. recommendaI hope that the Budget Opposition will support my condemnation It this is industrial blackmaU. The correct position stated succinctly by the former Minister for Agriculture in the Labor Government, Senator when he said in respect of these bans. It is a matter for the government of the day to make a judgment as to whether Australia continues to trade with a country, and on what basis. I do not think it is the role of any group in the community to make decisions of the nature of this loading ban. parAnother example of a poUtically motivated boyis the ACTU ban on the handUng of Indonesian flag vessels. These bans were against alleged Indonesian At the time the bans flagvessels existed. many AusI am informed that since early year some for the wheat informed the specification of the ships is such as would the exacting requirements of Australian which are well black ban unions. maritime Now Australian unions are to being hamper cent of Australia's In those vessels. 1976 Indonesia took 6 exports wheat and with now greater in jeopardy. I am not arguing the merits or demerits of the Government of the country concerned. I abhor the reported actions of the Indonesian in East Timor. But if we ban exports because we do not Uke a particular government's poUtical colour or actions, then we wtil not be doing very much trade with many other type of ban-on e countries at all. I move onto the other type of ban I have menthat is, action designed to support restrictive and protective practices by certain unions. For example, I mentioned the bans and demands placed on Utah Mining Australia Ltd by the Seamens Union of Australia to force coal to be carin Australian flag ships with Australian crews. That demand may seem reasonable in respects but jobs for AustraUans cannot be guaranteed when Australians price themselves out of world markets. International comparisons show that employing Austrahan seamen is vasdy more expensive than employing seamen from therefore, other countries. In making comparisons I refer the developed countries, not just the low countries. At present the annual cost shipowner of employing an Austrahan able man is about $23,000 which is more than 200 cent higher than the cost to a British shipowner. An Austrahan seaman enjoys 6 weeks more leave per annum than his British counterpart. Furthermore, Austrahan costs are from 25 per cent to 50 per cent higher than crew costs United States of America, West Germany Sweden. If seamen's demands were acceded by Utah the freight rate wouldrisefrom $9 to $18 per tonne and would quite clearly place company in an untenable position. ter for Transport ( Mr Nixon) said recently, is doing Australian farmers, miners, exporters and in fact the AustraUn people a great service standing firm against the union's demands. Seamen's Union has priced itself out of the marthat ket and however much we would Uke it, Australian Australia cannot afford to employ Australian flag carriers in highly competitive industries such the coal industry. We cannot penalise competicated tive export industries in order to protect groups which have developed artificially high cost structures. An even more extraordinary example of union action is the ban promoted by the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union on the export Uve sheep to the Middle East. That union wrote letters to the Prime Ministers of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in April this year threatening to ban the export of Uve sheep unless those tries took more sheep carcasses. What an arromovement gant, pompous mob of industrial blackmaUers! repeat that when Senator Wriedt was a Minister in the Australian Labor Party Government stated: It is a matter for the Government of the day to make a judgment as to whether Australia continues country, and on what basis. I suggest that if a country is prepared to buy trahan goods or produce at a proper market then Australia is hardly in a position to place costly conditions on the sale which are designed to force that country to pay for higher cost ements of our economy. Decisions about mduswhole try protection should be the subject of separate Government consideration, not an imposition way of capricious action by a few union officials not answerable to the pubUc. Action of this nature by a few Australian unions is damaging Australia's reputation as a stable, reUable supplier of basic commodities. What is at stake, is not merely the sales of the particular to commodities I have mentioned. What is at stake wage is the future of our more competitive export industries and our international standing as a to an Austrahan major trading nation. seaI beUeve that the Budget which has been per brought down by the Treasurer ( Mr Lynch) gives guidance to the country as to how we can continue to get ourselves out of the economic problems which were a result of sociaUst poUcies pursued by the previous Government. But apart in the from a Budget which was brought down by a or Government, we must also have a community to attitude which places an emphasis on personal incentive and on the sort of cost consciousness the that we need to make ourselves competitive once As the Minisagain in world markets.",60
178,Mr JAMES ,"Hunter) (4.0)-The honourable member for Casey ( Mr Falconer) in his usual in dignified way launched a vicious verbal assault The on Australian trade unions. I honestly believe had it not been for the strength and unity of trade unions the overall population of Australia today would not be enjoying its present as standard of living. The honourable member indithat he was strongly opposed to the maritime unions taking action against the handUng of Indonesian ships. I think his speech would have been more balanced had he added to those remarks that the Australian trade union movement, and particularly the maritime unions, have of been consistent all the way down the Une with even Indonesia. The Indonesian Government was reminded late last year by several members of the Australian Labor Party when they were in counIndonesia and when the Australian trade union was being criticised by the heads of I the Indonesian Government, that the Austrahan trade union movement employed simUar embarhe goes and fought just as tenaciously for the Indonesians when they werefightingfor independence against the more or less harsh to trade with a Dutch colonialists. The honourable member for Casey faded to Ausmention on which side he came down when he pricespoke about the maritime unions of Australia refusing to load and man the Jeparit when it was taking munitions to that awful, dirty war in Vietelnam not so many years ago and which today the world frowns on. Were the actions of the unions wrong then? I say no. Their actions are by not wrong in connection with Chtie, because Chile has a mUitary government which overthrew a true democracy. It was a people's elected democracy. I mentioned in the Parhament only the other night that things had not changed much since the eighteenth century when people in Britain put up arguments which were the same as honourable members of the Liberal Party are putting up today. The arguments related to economic advantages and about pricing ourselves out of overseas markets. That was the argument, and it is worth a brief mention again, which was raised in Britain at thetimeofthe slave trade. That outstanding moralist politician William Wilberforce was endeavouring to influence Britain. When William Wilberforce put a Bill before the House of Commons seventimesseeking to abolish the slave trade, which is to the everlasting disgrace of our mother country, he was told that Britain's foreign exchange would suffer if Britain abolished the slave trade, that her seamen would be put out of work and that the ship building industry in Britain would become redundant. Britain then, as now, professed to be a Christian country, but it was involved up to hilt and had a monopoly over the slave trade in the world, carting slaves from northern Africamanacled together, on starvation diets, below the decks of ships-manacle d together like sardines-in the main to the West Indies. That is same argument which honourable members on the Government side advance today, not the moral argument but the quid argument because they belong to the quid party. I hope to develop that proposition more strongly iftimepermits in this debate. Mr Falconer-Why do you not answer Senafigures tor Wriedt's argument?",62
179,Mr JAMES,"I did not interrupt the honourable member for Casey. Apparently he is getting stirred up by the truth that I am speaking now. positive However, we are debating the 1977-78 Budget launched by the Treasurer ( Mr Lynch). Everyyoung one agrees that Austraha has two overriding economic problems, namely, unemployment and inflation. Many of the Western countries are Hunter, suffering from the same problems yet Mr Fraser and Mr Lynch have given us a Budget which, in the opinion of most economists, does nothing about either of these problems except make worse. I think it is appropriate for me to disclose the Parhament in this debate the latest unemhas ploymentfigureswhich have been released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics today. The Australian Bureau of Statistics unemployment survey for August shows a disastrous slide in labour market and it is projected that unemployan ment willriseto at least 450,000 or 7.5 per cent of the work force in 1978. This is what the Party has been saying. The Bureau provides the Prime Minister's preferred index. He rubbishes the Commonwealth Employment Service's figures. He says that they are unreliable. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Street, when releasing the August unemployment statistics last Friday, claimed that 'unemployment during the month declined in line with the normal seasonal pattern'. He claimed in July that 'there was no clearly evident pattern in the labour market' during that month. The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics seasonally adjusted series refutes the Minister's claim. Unemployment, in seasonally adjusted terms, is now running at 355,000 or 5.7 per cent of the work force. It is 60,700 more than it was 12 months ago. In seasonally adjusted terms, unemployment has been increasing in each quarter of this year. The position is most serious for young the people between the ages of 15 and 19 years; 16.7 per cent of them cannotfindwork; 37,000 young people are still looking for theirfirstjob. That is an increase of more than 700 over thefigurefor the last quarter, at a time when the normal the seasonal pattern should show a decline. Instead of positive action, the Government feeds speculation about an early election. Ministers attempt to inflame the uranium debate. The Prime Minister tries to intimidate the ConciUation and Arbitration Commission and the Industries Assistance Commission. He blames the unions, although the Statistician yesterday released which show that the number of industrial disputes in June was fewer than it has been for 6 years. Australia needs a job-led recovery. Without leadership the Uves of generations of people will be bUghted, just as an earUer generation was bUghted in the Great Depression, of which I was a victim. In my electorate of in Cessnock, the unemployment rate among youth is approximately 14 per cent. These young people could develop a sense of being nobody. They lose their pride. They lose their personahty. Is it any wonder that some of them drift them towards crime and drugs? The Government came into power with the sole intention of curing to the twin evtis of inflation and unemployment. It faded in its attempt to cure both these evils that rack Australia today. As the Australian Financial Review, our most respected economic journal, which, in my view, frequently writes as the impartially as any other newspaper, declared in editorial quite recently that mflation is virtuaUy shoved on the doorstep of the Arbitration Labor Commission. Unemployment is ignored. As a result of this Budget, the number of unemployed will exceed 400,000 by Christmas of this year, and inflauon, on the Government's admission, will be at least as high as it was previously. The amazing thing is that people have trumpeting this Budget as an election winner. Are not we entided to ask: Who will benefit from it? The only people who will benefit from it be those already well off and secure in their jobs- a handful of people on the highest dollars incomes. Rich people-the Prime Minister, Fraser, included-wil l gain more in take-home pay each week than the majority of taxpayers ceive in their total weekly earnings. For the majority of people the so-called tax cuts are cruel fraud. Most of them make a gain of less than $3 a week, which is pitiful by comparison with the handouts to the wealthy. It will be immediately swallowed up by the higher price petrol and byrisinginflation. This is a budget prepared by the wealthy for the wealthy. As Bob Hawke said, it is a pentunfair house budget, conceived in a penthouse and economic directed to benefit those who occupy the pentmembers of houses of this country. Real government spendof the Press. the ing has been cut by nearly 2 per cent. Combined a scapegoat for with the cut of about 4 per cent last year, this will ing the problems direcdy reduce employment opportunities, partraUan people today. ticularly in the depressed building tion industries. Reducing the rate of inflation is headed 'Bench is ""useful"" out supposed to be the Government's the mcrease in petrol taxes, on top of unnecessary devaluations and the destructive changes to Medibank, will guarantee another year of rapid whipping-boy price increases. Inflation will be at a rate of at least 12 per cent this year. Real earnings will fall. The purchasing power of family allowances will the be reduced. The net effect of reduced and family allowances and the tax changes will be to cut the purchasing power of our incomes several dollars a week. Most dishonest of all is the Government's broken promises on tax indexation. Mr Lynch has continually promised full tax indexation. in this Budget half tax indexation is announced for a so-called transitional period which lasts until 30 June 1979. Instead of stimulating the economy and expanding employment opporan impartial way. tunities, the Government's excessive concessions to those already well off will increase the numbers who cannot get jobs. About $800m of potential company tax receipts is being given this year. The special youth employment training program will cost $18m. While mining comaction. panies receive concessions, small business suffers. The rural community is ignored. In the Parhament today the Government took another step towards reducing the export levy on coal. This will prove a bonanza to the major multi-national coal compames which are operating in this country. It will be to the tune of well been over $100m. Yet the honourable member for Casey a shorttimeago had the temerity to say that we were pricing our way out of world marwill kets. If Utah Mining Australia Ltd and Ciutha Development Pty Ltd are making ntilhons of and are not prepared to sponsor the cartMr age of Austrahan coal to overseas markets by Austrahan ships and Australian seamen, those recompanies should subsidise the wages of seavast men. They are not. Big business of the multia national type, such as Utah, Ciutha and the other giants in the coal industry would never agree to that because it is more important to such companies that they pay the highest dividends to of their shareholders who would not know where the companies are operating. This Budget is dishonest, sectional, grossly and basically useless in dealing with our problems. It has been truly exposed by Opposition and certain sections The Government has used others as its economic inadequacies in curthat greatly affect the AusAn article in the Melbourne and construcAge of 2 September points the position.

The Industries Assistance Commission, I believe, is an honourable instrument of government. It does not serve one party or the other in government, other than in The Government has attacked its own employees by introducing the Industrial Relations up Bureau legislation. The Government has tried to provoke its employees into taking industrial It rushed through in one day this important legislation which affects Commonwealth employees. The Government had the temerity to give the Labor Party Opposition onlyfiveminour utes notice of its intention to bring in this lation. The Government looks for scapegoats which it can blame for the problems which it should shoulder. In industrial disputation, as said a shorttimeago and as revealed by the reau of Statistics, the strike rate June, July and August was the lowest for six years. So the Government is trying to blame everyone but itself for its economic ills. It also commg under severe and, in my view, justifiable criticism for its attitude towards education. The Sydney Morning Herald a shorttimeago carried an article under the heading 'Commission and Government clash over school funds'. It was themselves, referring to the Schools Commission. The article read as follows: The Schools Commission has refused to support eral Government's directive to transfer $5 million from government to private schools. The Government intends again to subsidise some of the most wealthy schools to the detriment of the pubhc school system and, in my view, is endeavouring to arouse another sectarian war in the country. The newspaper article continued: In its report, the commission said it was determined tect programs for disadvantaged schools and for special cation including the teaching of migrants. The commission also said that the Government, ing its own target of 2 per cent real growth in spending schools next year in favour of no growth was, in practice, resorting to annual budgeting and negating the benefit of a rolling triennium. The Government has failed to overcome the whole problems that are harassing the countiy. The omic Government has failed to overcome the two of them major problems which it went into power to them offered overcome, namely, unemployment and inflation. we could move The Government has failed the people of of all, not one ofto Austraha, who are in desperate straits. It has cut for the mood, and the showed back on education, on welfare igines, on child minding centres and on a host of other things on which it cannot properly justify cutting back. It is virtually turning this ment into a Jewish synagogue, in the view many of the people in my electorate and elsewhich where.

180,Mr SHORT ,"Ballaarat) (4.17)-For most of alone, us, the Budget Debate is the one time of the year when members can speak in this chamber about virtually anything they hke related to governcatastrophes ment and Parliament. Such is the pervasiveness of the Budget that it touches almost all aspects daily lives. Ifindit a pity that more members legisdo not use this opportunity to express to the nation their views on the totaUty of things pertaining to the nation. Rather, they concentrate on I scoring points off each other, and on deaUng with Buthe smaller issues of detail contained in the in the nation for Budget Papers. Perhaps that is pohtics. Equally, however, is perhaps that is why, regrettably, poUtics and otiticians are not held in the regard that I be6eve they need to be held in if Australia is to continue toflourishas a ParUamentary democracy, if AustraUans are going to regain confidence in if we are going to restore the feeling of national pride that we used to have but which, to our great condemnation and to our ultimate disaster, we appear to have lost. I can only pray the Fedthat we will turn thetideon these fundamental precepts before too long. We can do so, and we can do so very easily, all we need is the wtil-the recognition that either we stand together or we of this countiy will fall together. That is why I regret that the Opposition during this Budget debate-indeed , during the Ufe of this Parliament-ha s been negative and obstructo protionist. It has looked back in surly anger rather eduthan forward and constructively. The contributions to this debate by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr E. G. Whitlam) and his two economic by rejecttutors-the honourable members for Adelaide on ( Mr Hurford) and for Oxley ( Mr Hayden) were the worse I have ever heard from any three top parUamentary leaders from any party hi my experience. Not one of them showed any awareness of the real facts of our present econsituation and the background to it. Not one looked forward to the future. Not one of any positive suggestion as to how a better Australia. Most sadly them any appreciation aspirations, of the Aushousing for Abortralian people. The best they could do collectively was to sugParliagest more and more government spendingof more and more of the same old medicine with they bedevtiled Australia between 1973 1975, medicine which led to a fourfold increase in inflation, to the loss of countless thousands of jobs in productive activity, to a 150 per cent increase in unemployment in 18 months to a massive loss of consumer and investor confidence, to the near destruction of the manufacturing and rural sectors, to a legacy of other which brought this nation and its people to their knees. Not once did these giants of of the so called alternative government make a constructive suggestion. Not once did they acknowledge what the Fraser Government has achieved in the short space of 21 months of government. Not once did they make any recognition of the underlying strength of this Budget as a major cornerstone in the continuing recovery of the Austrahan economy- a recovery which is underway and which promises to make 1978 a better year for all AustraUans. What are the achievements of this Governpension ment? Let me list just a few of them, because today I want to look forward rather than ward. Some of the achievements are worth restating because unfortunately not enough increase people seem to be aware of them. The overriding achievement has been the reduction in mflation. The Fraser Government won office in 1975 for many reasons, but none more important than for its pledge to attach No. 1 priority to this issue. the 21 months since this Government took office, the underlying rate of inflation in Australia fallen by more than 40 per cent-fro m 16.7 per cent to approximately 10 per cent. Indicators published m the past few days indeed suggest that we are now back to single digit inflation. Inflation is still too high. But I assert without any fear of contradiction that had the Fraser Government not won office in December 1975 the present rate of inflation under a Whitlam government would now have been in excess of 20 per cent. Just think what that would have done to the economic and social fibre of this country. Not only would inflation have for skyrocketed, so also would have unemployment. Unemployment has increased since the present Government came into office. The increase has been about 1 per cent of the work force-or , put it in another way, there has been approxitools mately a 25 per cent increase in the number of persons unemployed. In the last 18 months of Whitlam Government unemployment increased by 150 per cent. Mr MCLean-How much?",65
181,Mr SHORT,"By 150 per cent. Had that people? Government stayed in office unemployment could by now have reached a level of some cent of the work force, compared with the presentfigureof some 5 h per cent. In the 21 months since the Fraser Government won office, there has been positive growth in the economytaken growth which is of fundamental importance if the living standards of Australians are to be improved in Une with the aspirations of Ausits tralians. By contrast, in the last 18 months of Labor Government real output in Austraha fell by some 5 per cent. So by most tests the Government's comparative overaU economic record has been good since it assumed office. Let us now have a brief look at what the Fraser Government has done for people. For the low income earner with a large famtiy, the Government's famtiy allowance system has provided the greatest boost for very many years. For the pensioner, the Government's decision to tie increases automatically to increases in the cost of living has provided security to penbacksioners for thefirsttime in our history. For the unemployed, there has been a major in retraining and other schemes to better equip these persons for re-entry to the work force. Unemployment is a major problem. It is not a problem that wtil go away quickly or easily, even when the overall rate of economic recovery In picks up. It must not be turned into a poUtical footbaU the way the Labor Party is attempting. It has is much too serious for that. Human life and human dignity are at stake. The problem must be analysed logically yet compassionately, and logical yet compassionate solutions found. That requires co-operation and constructive effort on all sides-no t the negative obstructionism and politicking in which the Opposition is engaging. We must foUow the lead of the present Government and take a fresh look at labour market poUcies, giving much more emphasis than in the past to breaking down the underlying structural barriers that are such an important reason much of our present unemployment, particularly amongst the unskUled and the young. We must make sure that young students are being adequately equipped with such basic tools as the to abUity to read and write and spell adequatelywhich many school leavers today appear to lack. We must ensure that different forms of eduthe cation pay full regard to future vocational prospects and that we as a community obtain the best value we can for the money-ou r money as taxpayers-spen t on education. What else has the Government done for For the aged, it has greatly increased the amount of accommodation being built. For 8 per handicapped children, it has made major improvements in the allowances paid to their parents or guardians. For the farmer, it has resx tored some of the necessary assistance that was away by the Whitlam Government-and taken away at a time when that Government was hellbent on destroying rural producers through reckless approach to economic management the and its complete disregard for the inflationary consequences of its actions. For the farmer also, the introduction of income equalisation deposits and the new tax averaging arrangements will prove of major benefit, in both the short and longer terms. On top of that there have been thelarge Government's actions in restructuring the Aushave tralian Meat Board, in introducing major changes designed to improve the situation in dairy industry, in increasing the floor price for wool, in the impending establishment of a rural bank, and many more. For all income earning Australians, the desirable. introduction of tax indexation last year, and the taxation reforms announced in this Budget already produced, so far as indexation is cerned, and will produce, so far as the new scales are concerned, major income tax relief. Every Australian personal income taxpayer received a cut in taxation on 1 July this year. Every Australian personal income taxpayer wtil receive another cut hi taxation on 1 February next, a sttil further cut on 1 July 1978, and annual cuts, depending on the rate of mflation, every year thereafter. Despite some misunderpsychology. standings about the Government's initial presencourse, tation of these taxation reduction measures and despite what the Opposition may say, it is a fact that these measures represent major reductions in taxation. 'As a package, they represent most far-reaching beneficial changes to our sonal income tax system in our historyPty beneficial to each and every personal income taxpayer in Australia. Time does not permit me to catalogue further the impressive Ust of the Fraser Government's achievements. Many of them were introduced before the 1977 Budget. Some were introduced in the Budget. Others have been introduced since. A Budget, no matter how important it may be, is only one of a host of complex economic dewell cisions that are taken in the course of a year. must therefore be careful not to get the Budget out of perspective. That said, however, a Budget does tend to set the basicfiscaland monetary framework for the economy in the year ahead, at least in those areas of policy for which governtion ment has responsibUity. The framework profidence vided by the 1977 Budget is sound. It is responinflation. sible. It is forward looking and innovatory. The deficit for 1977-78 has been reduced some $500m below last year's outturn. That wtil be anti-inflationary. EquaUy important, though, it should provide the scope for a downward movement in interest rates as the year progresses, and therefore an easing of the cripirresponsibtiity. pling interest and repayment burden facing thousands of individuals and companies, parwtil ticularly small businesses. This in turn should have an expansionary effect on economic activity. But the Government will need to be exthetremely careful in its interest rate pohcy. Too an interest rate reduction too quickly could damaging effects on money markets. It also could have undesirable consequences for the the exchange rate for the Australian doUar; and it could cause a resurgence of inflation. But, properly managed, I amfirmlyconvinced that a sustainable reduction in interest rates during 1977-78 is not only possible but also highly have The forecasts for growth of gross domestic conproduct, and for unemployment, contained in rate the Budget documents are not particularly cheerful- a 2 per cent year-on-year growth in real GDP, and Uttle or no change in unemployment. Their impUcations for productivity are also worrying. One cannot Ughtly dismiss sophisticated econometric forecasts. On the other hand, these forecasts do not take into account nonquantifiable factors such as consumer or investor The significance of these is, of as much a matter of subjective judgment as anything else. My own subjective judgment is that the forecasts may well turn out to be pessimistic, at least so far as real GDP growth is conthe cerned. Other commentators, including W. D. perScott and Co. Pty Ltd, Phtiip Shrapnel and Co. Ltd and the Commercial Bank of Australia, for example, appear to share this view. Above all else, the Government will need to be Ught on its feet in its economic management during 1977-78. This appUes particularly to monetary poUcy. The growth in money supply may well need to exceed the 8 per cent to 10 per cent targeted for hi the Budget Speech. The Treasurer ( Mr Lynch) has indicated clearly that he is very aware of this. But although it will need to be WeUght on its feet, there are several objectives that the Government will move away from only at great risk to its basic strategy. The main on is, of course, maintenance of the exchange rate at about its existing level. Any significant devaluaof the doUar would be a major blow to conand a major blow to thefightagainst In that context the recent remarks of the to honourable member for Oxley, speculating about the future of the dollar, should be deplored by aU thinking members on both sides of the House. Corning from the Opposition's main economic spokesman, Ifindthem the height of If we stay on the broad course now charted by the Government, we not only see continuing improvement in the economy over 1977-78 but also wtil have continued to lay the foundations for steady and sustainable econfact. omic growth into the 1980s. It is to this latter issue that I want to time remaining to me. We in Austraha, as in many other countries of the Western world, appear to be suffering some crisis of confidencenot only in our governments but also in ourselves as individuals. Why is there a crisis of confidence in government-no t the Government, but the institution of government itself? The reasons viously are many and varied. But the reason place top of my list is that we as individuals over many years now have come to rely on governimate ment far too much, in a way which has made quite impossible for any government to Uve up community expectations. We have tended to say to ourselves that if we want something we will run along to government first, rather sider what we might be able to do to help ourselves. There must be a limit to what we ask government to do for us. Government can only so much. It has a basic responsibUity to determine the parameters within which our economy and our community function. It has basic responsibUity to assist those in our comsituation munity who are most in need. It also has a reage sponsibUity to give a lead to community thinking and community attitudes. It has a responsibUity to reflect and to react to community attitudes, in fact these can be determined. But at the end the day it is our actions and our attitudes, individuals, which will determine how Australia develops economically, socially and morally. We need a fresh attitude on mind in this government country. We need to regenerate our confidence. signal We need to be less self seeking and to think moredamental importance of others. We need to get away from confronin our vast continent. tation and back to co-operation. But we can do moved courageously andThe this only if all sections of our community are these areas. It has beenresponsibly genuinely prepared to co-operate. Without sincerity in this regard, attempts at co-operation remarks today have been phUosophical.ofSome will lead only to appeasement and, to a victory for industrial or economic muscle over the less organised and weaker sections of the comsay munity. I beheve that as a community we need be prepared to see government role in the total scheme of things. We need courage poUtical parties to that end. The traUan Labor Party, however, is fundamentally opposed to this concept. It is unashamedly-this is pubhcly admitted and accepted- a party government. It beheves that government knows Hindmarsh. better than the people what is best for those people. It believes that it can spend people's money more effectively and more wisely than the people themselves. Let us never forget this basic There is a major difference between the political philosophies of the two major parties on this issue. turn in the The Fraser Government has taken a major lead in restoring incentive to AustraUans. It has reformed the taxation system so as to leave more income in the hands of people and to aUow them to choose how they spend this income. It has taUored health and social welfare policies so that they cater for the needy rather than for those obwho can more easUy provide for themselves. I There is more that it needs to do. It must cut down on the regulations and restrictions on legitbusiness activity which have grown up it over the years. It must recognise more the to differences between big business and small business, and take account of these in its pohcies, particularly in relation to the avaUabUity of than confinance for small businesses. It must encourage a wage fixing system which do pays full regard to the need to reward productivity, effort and scarce skUls-rathe r than a system m which wages are determined without a regard for these factors, which is broadly the under wage indexation. It must encourprogressive reform of the trade union movement. Here I have in mind particularly the need for the development of industry unions rather if than the fragmented union structure we now ofhave. It must elevate decentraUsation to the level as of a major national objective. The Government has made a smaU, but highly significant, step in this direction in the Budget by allocating $6m for general decentralisation purposes. This is the first time to my knowledge that any Federal has taken such a step. I hope it is a that the Government recognises the funof greater decentralisation Government has in many of real government in a generation. Manyreformist the most my might say they have been naive.

It wtil lower the level of employment. All experts- I emphasise the word 'experts'now agree that the number of unemployed by the end of this year wtil increase to at least 430,000.

I pause for a moment to examine the increase charges, made by people who ought to know ter, against the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission for being responsible for wage increases which occurred, particularly in further 1973-74. The record proves that the Arbitration Commission was not responsible for them. Mr King-It was the Labor Government.",69
187,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,"The Labor them. Government had nothing to do with the wage increases which occurred in private industry 1973-74. They came about as a consequence agreements made between the unions and the private employers. Private employers were able to offer increased wages because they knew thatsorts they could simply pass the increases on to a goods hungry public who were wtiling to pay them. whatever price was asked for the goods they needed so badly at a time when they were getting for the first time in their Uves the money needed to buy them. The Prices Justification bunal should have more accurately monitored the effect of increased wages which were given under sweetheart agreements in order that the their price increases could be passed on so that these excessive demands should not have had to be paid by the rest of the people. I remember an occasion when the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union asked me to support an appUcation before the PJT for an mcrease in the price of products of Comalco Ltd or Alcoa of Australia Ltd- I am not sure which. I told the official of the AMWU bluntly that I would not be a party to any policy that would allow selected groups to give specially increased wages to atinyhandful of workers and pass the increases on to the others. I am sorry to say that own Government went before the Prices Justo tification Tribunal and actually supported an in the price of steel by Broken Htil Proprietary Co. Ltd at a time when I was being told as Minister for Labour that we ought to be talcing a more active part before the ConciUation and Arbitration Commission against increases in prices. The fact is that the Conciliation and Arbiby tration Commission had nothing to do with the increases in wages which occurred in 1973-74. It a bystander, a spectator standing on the sidelines, unable to do anything about them. No of one bothered to go to the Conciliation and Arbiwill go on blamtration Commission. It is true that the Australian PubUc Service arBoard offered very substantial increases to the servants which had a marked effect upon levels outside. It offered a 12 per cent to second and third division officers and beta 16 per cent increase to the people whom I describe correctly as the fat cats of the PubUc Service. The next year the Board offered a increase. These offers, made without the authority or approval of the Cabinet, were the principal reason that the wage escalation occurred. We can no longer give massive increases to the Public Service and expect people outside the PubUc Service not to want to try to match them. They have everyrightto match If taxpayers are put in a position where they have to give their pubUc servants more in money, better superannuation schemes and aU of kinds of recreational schemes they have every right to expect the same benefits themselves. If the pubUc cannot afford to give themselves these of benefits, the pubUc servants who are supposed to serve the pubUc have no right to ask for We should not Uve in a situation in which we they are governed by a group of modern mandarins Triwho expect everything from the public purse for themselves and expect everybody outside to put up with wages which are infinitely lower than own. It is a terrible crime in the name ofjustice that metal workers are getting less money now than a Class 4 clerk in the Commonwealth PubUc Service. It is a travesty of wage justice that a toolmaker should be getting $60 a week less than a Class 2/3 clerk in the Pubhc Service. know Class 4 clerks who are no more than 23 isation years of age and are earning about $10,000 year. That cannot go on. It has to end. If able members want to see the real cause of wage spiral in that year they should direction in which I am now pointing. The claim that wage increases in the private sector have been responsible for inflation and unemployment does not stand up to critical is analysis. If wage levels have anything to do with the levels of mflation and unemployment we pany; should now have a lower level of inflauon and aabeing higher level of employment than we had two now years ago. The level of real wages has fallen by exchanges more than 6 per cent since this Government price of $5.60. came to office less than two years ago. If this argument is sound the reduction of about 6.2 cent in real wages should have brought about reduction in inflation and an increase in employleviathan. ment. It has done neither. If low wages would solve unemployment and inflation, how is it levels of inflation and unemployment in low wage countries such as Mexico, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Indonesia and the PhUippany pines-on e could go on and on selecting the wage countries of the world-ar e higher than they are here? The causes of inflation are not hard to find. There is not one single cause. In the financial pages of the daily Press record profits are announced every day of the week. I challenge anybody to produce for me a daUy newspaper for any day of last year in wbich there was not an announcement of a record profit for some comcharges pany or another, usuaUy the Australian subsidimdustry ary of some multinational corporation whose board rooms in places like New York, Too Stockholm, London or Amsterdam govern the poUcies and prices of the company. Excessive profits, price transfers to parent transnational, high interest charges and indirect taxation the main causes of inflation. The increase in the price of petrol, which this Government has deUberately brought about with its eyes wide open, will increase the consumer price index by 1technology. per cent and that will immediately impose upon mdustry an increase in wages of $2 a week for everybody on average weekly earnings. Not only is inflation affected by these influences, employment is affected by them well. Unemployment is also partly due to inefficient management. Honourable members talk about inefficient labour. I assert now that management in Australia is about the most country inefficient of any part of the highly industrialised world. Australia is notorious for its bad manageI ment. Management here has no idea of rationalofits industry. I point to one of the biggest a and oldest companies in Australia, the Broken honourHU1 Pty Co. Ltd, which is one of the worse the managed companies in Australia. For years it look in the was managed by alcoholics. Mr MCLean-Oh !",69
188,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,Do not laugh. BHP badly managed and I do not care whether honourable members have shares in that comthey are being robbed. If their shares were properly managed they would be receivmg much bigger dividend than they are receiving and the price for BHP shares on the stock would be greater than the present,70
189,per Mr HAYDEN ,It is an inefficient leviathan.,70
190,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,"It is an inefficient That is the expression used by the honourable member for Oxley and I agree with that that. It is an inbred management. Top management people are not brought in from outside BHP. They have to come up through the comas do public servants. The company does low not get any new bright ideas. MCLennan will be succeeded by somebody else who wiU be just about as outdated as the man he succeeded. What is true of BHP is true of many other compames in Australia as well. I believe that industry needs to be rationalised. It needs to be updated so that throughput can be increased, so that overhead can be reduced. What is also very important is a reduction in interest rates. It is interest as much as anything else that are killing in Australia today. We need a greater use of modern technology than we now have. many of our industries are trying to continue with outdated machinery, outdated technology. We should be spending more time seeing what kind of technology is avaUable to industry in are countries such as West Germany, the United States, even the Soviet Union, Italy and France. But we do nothing about that. The Government does nothing to encourage the inflow of modern It is no use having modern technology if we do not have technologists and technicians to operate it. It is no use having modern laser machinery in this country if we do not have people to operate as it. We ought to spend more money on technical education, on teaching people to become technicians and technologists, and a lot less money on universities. I am sick and tired of seeing this spending hundreds of mUlions of dollars on universities, teaching people to be good at arithmetic, algebra or something else but knowing absolutely nothing at all about productivity or about how to make this country tick. Such people can tell us all about the moon, they can tell us about the stars, they can tell us how many cells there are in a sour sob bug, but they cannot tell us anything about industry or how to make this country more productive and more competitive. We need to expand the level of employment in tertiary fields. In countries such as the Soviet Union and the United States they have now discovered that, with the rapid pace of Ufe we are living towards the end of the century, they need a big influx of psychologists if people are to be able to handle the pace of life. But what are we doing? We have some psychologists, but not enough. We have some social workers, but not enough. We need more people to provide child care facUities for the mothers of this country. More money needs to be spent on recreation. It is not necessary for the whole of our work force to be out there shovelling dung. They do not all have to spend their Uves that way. There are more ways of earning a Uving than that. We have to commence an expansion in the tertiary level because the secondary industries are dropping rapidly in their capacity to employ as technology comes into being. What we need more than anything else and we need it urgently-I eventually persuaded the Government of which I was a member to agree to it but nothing more has been done about it-is to set up a bureau of labour economics for the purpose of making period projections of labour needs right up to the year 2000 at least. The Americans are doing it and the Russians are doing it but we have done nothing at all. If one went to the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations and asked how many computer experts would be needed in six years time they would probably want to know what a computer expert was. They would not be able to say what would be the needs in thattime.We need to have facUities, and this can only be done by a properly organised bureau of labour economics, which would be able to tell young people what vocational options are avaUable to them. IBM has a machine now which, if the various factors important for determining vocational opportunities are fed in, such as the background, the parents background, their educational capacity and so forth, can come up with as many as 400 different options. Probably 350 of those options would be vocations of which neither the parents nor the chUd had ever heard. This is what we need. We need this bureau to measure the trend and the incidence of industrial accidents and occupational diseases. Honourable members opposite talk about strikes, but we are losing twice as many man days through accidents and diseases in industry which could be avoided. The only good thing I can ever say about BHP is that it has reduced the incidence of industrial accidents and disease from 95 points to 15 points. If an inefficient industry like BHP canreducethe level of the incidence of accidents to that level, others ought to be able to do it as well. Honourable members opposite talk about productivity, but nobody knows the productivity trends in Australia today. If we had a productivity index for increasing wages to compensate for increased productivity no one would know where to start. They would not know what the starting point of the productivity bonus scheme would be because nobody knows the productivity. We need to be able to measure year by year the productivity in Australia as a whole, the productivity industry by mdustry and branch by branch of industry. Unless we do that we have no chance whatever of competing. Part of the cause of unemployment is buyer resistance. We reached market saturation for the upper and middle classes of people during the 1973-1974 years of economic buoyancy. The people who have needs to be satisfied now are not receiving the incomes necessary to meet their needs. The wrong people are benefiting from the Government's fiscal policy. Some 330,000 potential buyers of the goods that the factories in Australia want to sell have no income except social service handouts. A proper coal export levy on Utah and the other coal exporters would have yielded an extra $200m in revenue each year. But that was not done. Instead of increasing the levy, as should have been done, this Government reduced the levy. Whom did it help? Nobody but the wealthy Utah Development Company and the foreign owned multinational corporations which now have control of our vast resources. The Government could have done more to encourage a manpower training program. It did nothing at all about that. A consumer-led recovery is our only hope for getting increased employment. But that calls for a higher level of income for those who are most likely to spend it on consumer goods-the 64 per cent of the work force who are not getting the average weekly earnings. Of course we know that hfe was not meant to be easy. It is not meant to be easy even for therich.They have to put up with an 8,000 acre property; they have to put up with three sports cars; they have to put up with three ate homes. The poor things nave to send their children to Melbourne Grammar School. If they have only one child they have to send him Magdalen College at Oxford. They have to try to get by on $2,000 a week. So it is after all, egalitarian society. Even the rich are having tough. Life is not meant to be easy.",70

192,Mr KING ,"Wimmera) (4.56)-It is always interesting to follow the honourable member Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) in a debate in this House. The honourable member seems to have an obsession with many things. One can always bet dollars to gooseberries that he start talking about die great profits-the profits' I think he called them today-of the multhat tinationals. I think the honourable member ratesthey challenged the House to name any multinational This which had not made record profits. I only wish I the differing had a bit more time to take him up on that point. numbers When talking about multinationals able member for Hindmarsh and many other heavy burden on many country members of the Opposition seem to forget irrespective of the size of profits, the important point is the investment that is involved. In other extensively in metropolitan areas, country words, the honourable member for Hindmarsh ought to look at the return that they receive for their capital investment. I am quite sure that if he heavy only accepted that argument he would appreciUke some ate what this matter is all about. After listening to the speeches made by memthese bers of the Opposition during this debate heve that there is very Utile one needs to answer to their criticism. I do not think I heard weaker comment from members of the brought Opposition during a Budget debate in the 18 years I have been a member of this place. I think the the same observation applies to comment that has been made outside this place. I do not think that there is any need for me to concentrate a area only. great deal of my time on answering anything has been put up by the Opposition. Also, I do not think that there is any need for me to expand some of the virtues of the Budget because this honourable has been done ably and well by many speakers the from my side of poUtics. I wish to raise a few issues that I believe Government should consider in the near future because I believe that no matter how good a budget may be there is always room for centre improvement. The first matter I wish to mention concerns Telecom Australia. I think I can say that in my 18 years as a member of this place separthere has been no problem more constant than the telephone problem and it is still growing. Years ago it was the poor service. Then came the to cost of upgrading telephone lines in country areas. Today it is the charges involved. These are an the basic complaints. The upgrading of teleit phone Unes started many years ago on a point system. The then Liberal-Country Party Government introduced a 25 kUometre departmental We had a change of government and the Labor Government reduced this to eight ldlometres. It estabUshed the Telecommunications and Postal Commissions and laid down the funfor damental rules that would apply. The main features of the rules were that 50 per cent of capital was to come from revenue and that the user pays principle should be adopted with little thought will given to those residing in remote areas. 'record Labor saddled the Commissions to a degree had no alternative but to increase the dramatically. We all recall this very vividly. increase was coupled with the removal of rental rates in accordance with the the honourfor a local caU fee. Thisthat of subscribers could be contacted then became a very business houses that as well as private citizens and primary In this day and age when the telephoneproducers. is used so cities and towns, any increased rates in instaUation charges, rental, local or trunk charges are a very burden on such users. My Party and I, unof my colleagues on the other side of the chamber, have been very concerned about rates for a very longtime.We have endeavI beoured to have improvements made. We did say in make some progress up until the change of have government in 1972. This change in government badtimesas far as subscribers were concerned, the worse being the charter laid down for Commissioners. I could give many examples of genuine hardship but time will not allow me to do so. I wtil therefore confine my remarks to one that Strange as it may seem, the matter I wish to raise concerns an area that is common to both the member for Wannon ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) and myself. I refer to the area known as Balmoral district which is situated approximately half way between Hamilton in the the Prime Minister's electorate and Horsham in the Wimmera electorate. The distance between the two major centres is some 80 miles. But in the the residents are unable to ring either city for a local call fee. This may seem strange to many people in this chamber. One exchange can contact only some 400 subscribers for a local fee. I wonder how many people subscribers in metrosuch poUtan areas can contact for the local caU fee? The people in this area have no access to doctor, hospital or major business house by way of a local call. On inquiry I am told that because of the zoning system there is Utde chance improvement They wtil continue to pay trunk rates for such calls. I wonder how many metroto S otitan subscribers would accept this situation? officers of the Department or the Telecommunispeech, cations Commission are no doubt sympathetic and have done aU that is possible to assist but condition laid down in the charter of the mission ties their hands. So I appeal to the as well as to the Minister for Post and Telecomcould munications ( Mr Eric Robinson) to give conUnfortunately sideration to easing the burden in such cases. The Commission is introducing a new radio telephone in the area of Longreach torate of Kennedy. I am sure that the honourable member for Kennedy ( Mr Katter) knows about that because no doubt he has had a bit to do with it. I am well aware of the problems facing the Commission regarding charges of various kinds. In accordance with the charter the Commission has to find about 50 per cent of capital and it also areas. has to implement the unfair user pays principle. If we adopt this principle in every other departI ment, well and good, but we do not do so. That is the all important point. Postal and telephone facUities are to my mind a service to the community. Government memon bers must always remember that. What would the position if we adopted a user pays principle in respect of many other fields in which the monwealth has a responsibihty such as raUways, education, water supply, social welfare and health? If we subsidise these fields and if we sidise pensioners, why do we not subsidise people who Uve in isolated areas? I am told that if a fuU charge, including aU capital costs such the cost associated with the construction of dams and water reticulation, was made in some States for water consumed, water would be too dear drink. We should think of the paid for shipbuUding which amounts to thousands of dollars for each man employed. This gument was put to the House not so many months ago. Therefore I say it is about time something was done to ease the problems of Telecom in areas outside our capital cities. Senator Lewis recently presented in the Senate a petition calling for the introduction of equal telephone charges throughout Australia based fallen on atimecaU. This petition was taken up by country people and it reaUy burnt I know that a scheme has many problems such as loading existing services and the fact that a 10c charge wtil not bring in the necessary revenue a required. Another problem is the fact that many city users would not accept such a scheme. But many thousands of subscribers want to see a of change. Senator Lewis and I agree that something must be done when subscribers are forced pay trunk charges to caU their doctor, hospital or business centre. As I mentioned earUer in my we subsidise other fields. We subsidise certain pensioners who in many cases are not in the such need of a telephone as are people living in Comremote areas where installation and trunk House charges are extremely high and in some cases be classified almost as discriminative. Senator Lewis' scheme as put forward could not be fully implemented. Nevertheless, the idea is a very worthy one and I comin the elecmend him for his suggestion. Perhaps we have now reached a stage when the Government should instruct the Commission or some other authority to carry out some sort of investigation into all areas of charges with a view to easing the burden created by trunk rates, particularly as they affect the minority in remote want to make a brief reference to immigration and how it affects the employment situation. As I see it, there are two important issues: Firstly, how our population is running by world standards and, secondly, what effect immigration has our work force or, better still, our unembe ployment situation. Under previous Liberal Country Party governments the broad policy was Comto increase our population by immigration by an average of 1 per cent of the population each year. This worked very satisfactorily. It brought to subAustralia a wealth of knowledge and helped to butid up our numbers, and generally speaking there was an improvement all round. Today, beas cause of economic pressures, our immigration program has dropped off dramatically. This has been the case now for a number of years and I to believe that we should be studying the matter subsidies that are very closely. arAccording to the managing director of IBIS, NA population of Australia-basicaU y Aboriginal, natuiaUy-was about 300,000, of 0.04 per cent of the world population. By 1870, roughly 100 years later, our population had increased to about 0.54 per cent of the world population. After roughly another 100 years, in 1977, it has to 0.33 per cent of the world population. If this trend is allowed to continue we could faU back to the 1788 level. I am not that pessimistic; but we could not afford for it to recede to that percentage, because many problems would Leader result. The general opinion of the effect of migration on our work force is that it creates unemployfirst year of senator ment. In my opinion, that is a fallacy and Last year the intake for Austraha was skilled workers. Coupled with that 18,000 people Australia exported in that year and imptiedbeef were some 22,000 people-wives , children, et the Government at the time could claim some cetera. The suggestion that migrants are required to do the dirty work is also a myth, in my article, opinion. It has been proved that migration has increased the specialist field in many areas. tural enrichment of our present society is terribly important. No longer is Australia made up of few farmers and a few others in the work force. We are Uving in an age of expanding technology. It is obvious that each time another migrant famUy is brought here work is created. Examplesmany are the buUding of new homes and extra school rooms, the provision of more hospital beds, so on. I could go on giving examples. It could well be said: 'Yes, but at what cost?' The cost could be no greater than the nation to deteriorate because of its lack of lation, and that is a vital point. Migration creates work, and the sooner we move along these lines the sooner people wtil regain confidence, and butid more homes and estabUsh more industry. preceding Australia is heading rapidly towards lation growth. If this trend continues, our the Minister for Primary Industry influence on world markets will disappear, ticularly in South East Asia. Without the abUity to make a worthwhUe contribution to general welfare, which is so important in the world that today, we soon could find ourselves second rate nation. In recenttimesI have noted that many comruining ments have been made about the beef mdustry. Itime read an article in today's Melbourne Sun headed 'Cattlemen just had to kick'. The article reported faced. some remarks made by the President of the Cattlemen's Union of Australia, Mr Graham cent MCCamley, about why his organisation had to that times kick. This gentleman complained ment that was made in this House the other nightthe leaders of the Cattlemen's by the honourable member for Leichhardt ( Mr tually sold the industry down the Thomson). He criticised the honourable member to play poUtics with it. Now wefind for Leichhardt and suggested that he should claiming to be virtually the spokesmen resign his seat if he could not carry out the duties expected of him. If anybody should resign I industry. would say it is people such as Mr are creating great difficulties in regard to the problems of the industry. In recenttimeswe have heard a lot about problems of the beef industry. I was quite amused to read a statement made recently by the of the Labor Party in the Senate, Senator Wriedt- a former Minister for Agriculture. I think honourablehe made the statement yesterday. The claimed that in 1973, the a myth.for beef on the overseasGovernment, the Labor market was the demand extremely 18,000 good. He went on to indicate how much that of the credit for it. I was surprised when I read that as I could not beUeve that the honourable senator could be so naive as to suggest that it was Culthe government of which he was a member that was responsible for those sales. Surely he must a appreciate that when international meat sales take place it is not Uke walking into a shop and buying a bag of lollies. Most deliveries are made as a result of decisions taken months earUer-in cases up to 12 months earUer. Countries such as Japan and the United States of America and work on a quota basis and deUveries could well be spread over six to 12 months, depending on the number of other issues that are raised at the cost of allowing the same time. popuIf the honourable senator really wants to be honest, I beUeve that he should be saying that the Labor Government, which came into office in so 1972, fulfiued agreements entered into by the zero poputies of the Government Minister for as a result of the activiTrade and Industry and in the LiberalparCountry Party Government. He also that the real collapse of the industry should came say under Labor Government, not under the Liberalbecoming a mand forParty Country and Government. Not only did the dethe price of meat collapse during that regime; the Labor Party was instrumental in the Australian economy. It created an all record inflation rate, thereby indirectly crippling the beef industry because of the costs it A lot of Press publicity has been given in reto the Cattlemen's Union.

193,Mr KING,"Of course it isridiculous.The older and more recognised and reputable organisthe ations, such as the Australian Farmers Federation, the Australian National Cattlemen's Council and the Austrahan Wool growers and Graziers Council, are the organisations that should be getting the credit for any actions that the Government is about to announce. They are the organisations which have carried the burden over a long period of time. I am quite confident that it was those organisations which influenced the Government'stitinkingon this all important issue. I do not wish to brand all members of the Cattlemen's Union as being irresponsible, cause I know that some of them are not. Howrather ever, I am very critical of those who are using that organisation for policital purposes. I believe that a large number of members of that organisment ation are genuinely looking for some assistance and they thought that the only way in which theycame could put forward a case to the government of the day was to form a new organisation. Anyone who understands the industry realises that a new program for handling meat cannot be introduced overnight. We have heard a lot about meat classification, covering weight and grade and sorts of things. It is terribly important, but it take many months to introduce it and to have available in all the large areas in which it necessary. I am told that there could be a delay of anything up to six months or 12 months in getting the equipment alone. Yet we hear people suggesting that meat classification should introduced tomorrow. To my mind, the Cattlemen's Union is acting worse like a fly-by-night organisation, and its spokeswhile the men are acting likefly-by-nightoperators. No off.

194,Mr YOUNG ,"Port Adelaide) (5.16)-Like Nelson's Column this Budget has crashed to the ground. There is total confusion throughout this country about the impact of this Budget and the Government has been doing its best to restrict debate on the Budget to non-broadcast days in order to redeem itself from what it may have done in the Budget. I want to reflect on two matters which the Government saw as being of prime importance in this second Fraser Government Budget. Firsdy I refer to taxation, and secbeondly to what the Government has done or has not done to put young people back to work. In presenting his Budget the Treasurer ( Mr Lynch) said that this new taxation adjustwas arevolutionary new scheme for personal income tax. However, when the scheme under scrutiny in the days that followed the delivery of the Budget, not only was it exposed by the Opposition in this ParUament but also by every other group interested in personal income tax. What it turns out to be is a system which assists those on the greatest income and tends all along with other decisions of the Government to wtil act against those people who happen to be on avit erage weekly earnings and who are now paying is so the Medibank levy. What the Government has failed to do in its new scheme is consider the other imposts it has placed upon the Australian commumty in the form of the Medibank levy be and the move towards world parity prices for crude oti. The average weekly earner willfindthat he is off under this new revolutionary scheme for income earner will be far better support to none other than the it was formed.Taxation Committee in New of the Wales which, taxation sysjoin, or tem, showed that everybody earning taxation earn great deal more than that, and so they do, but of the vast majority of wage earners in this country between $6,000 and $9,000 which is around weekly earnings while 64 per cent of the less than average weekly earnscheme wtil marginaUy those people. So much will not for the revolutionary scheme. $8,000 to be they are substantially worse off in their weekly pay packet than they before this revolutionary scheme was introduced. The Government went to so much trouble through the voice of the Treasurer to tell us how much benefit it was going to rain on the wage and salary earner as a result of this new taxation system. But the system has been exposed what it is and I do not wish to add my voice objection to it by going through the details figures which have been published. Suffice forassistance. me to say that it is a fraud on the average to have him beheve that something great will happen to his wage packet next February when them this revolutionary new taxation system comes those more into operation because it will home less after 1 February next year than he greater incentive to the takes home now. Let me take it one step further and consider the concept of taxation relief. If thefiguresthat have been given by so many instrumentalities are correct the people who will gain most out of taxation adjustment are those earning $15,000 a year and more. There are very few people in community, a handful representingfiveper cent or 10 per cent perhaps, earning more than $15,000 a year. According to the Treasurer's figures a person on $ 10,000 will save $ 195 a yearspend while a person on $15,000 will save $543 a year and, going further up the salary scale, a person on $25,000 will save $1,000 a year. Who in right mind, considering all the problems that Australia is facing today, could justify a person on $25,000 a year saving through this new revolutionary taxation system $20 a week while 5.4 per cent of our work force or almost people are out of work? Time and again Government spokesmen have stood in this Parhament and said that one man's pay increase is another man's job. That is not the Opposition's philosophy but it is the type of chche that is used regularly by Government spokesmen. If it is true to say that a wage increase for one person in job may cost another person the opportunity finding a job, why does not the same theory apply to taxation relief? If a government is prepared to spend $ 1,000m on taxation relief which will go mainly to those on high incomes, why does it not save those financial resources and give them to the people who really need them? Why do we not index the unemployment benefit and make it equal to half average weekly earnings? Why do we not spend more on manpower training, relocation and retraining? Why do we not spend more on young people? I will have a lot more to say about the opportunities provided by this Government for young people. How can the Government justify the expenditure of this money on the highest income earners while we are facing such enorployed, mous economic problems? How can the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) justify a member of Parliament saving $20 a week in taxation, the Treasurer saving $30 a week, or the Prime for Minister himself saving $50 a week while we in have these problems? It is not as though people and on that range of income need this sort of worker The Treasurer said that this new scheme wdl give people more incentive to work and will give incentive to work overtime. People on not. He will take annual salary.do salaries not get paid overtime, it is an Is Treasurer going to have work because he saves $30 a week? Is the life of a member of Parhament or of a person on a similar salary going to change dramatically as a result of this new scheme? Is thenlifestyle or their attitude to employment going to this change because they will save that amount of money as a result of this revolutionary tax adjustour ment which at the sametimewill place a penalty on a person receiving average weekly earnings? This is a government which believes in the great class distinction, which believes that it should its resources on the top echelon, on its supporters. It wants to forget about the person on average weekly earnings and about those who his are unemployed. I would like to hear any member of this national Parhament tell us how a person on average weekly earnings with a wife and two or three dependants is living, how he is enjoying the luxuries which this country has to 400,000 offer. He is the forgotten person. This Government is paying less and less attention to the massive problems we face in putting young people to work, in training them for the work that is available and in giving them the vocational guidance that is necessary. Countries in a Western Europe are leaving us far behind in this of regard. So much for the revolutionary new taxation system. So much for the taxation system which will do all things for all men in this country. The new revolutionary tax system as it is called is an absolute fraud because the vast majority of people will pay more and those who enjoy the privileges of a high income will receive more and more of the benefits whichflowfrom the decisions of this Government. The Government ought to look closely at what it has done. Before 1 February next year it ought to divert thosefinancialresources now being allocated in tax adjustment to areas where they are really needed. How dare the Federal Parliament of this country spend so much money by pouring it into the people already in jobs and on high incomes while we are facing a total of 500,000 unem6 per cent or 7 per cent of the work force. This includes young people who have left school and who have been searching for theirfirstjob or for a year or more. They have had a year on unemployment benefit, walking around the countryside looking forjobs. So I say that this is a government of privilege, and that is the way in which this decision has been made. That is the only way in which the decision can be interpreted. I say something now about the unemployed youth in this country and what is happening throughout the rest of the world. The Budget Speech, like so many other important areas, pays scant attention to the massive problem of unemployment. The statements attached to the Budget Speech tell us that at best- I use the words in the Budget Speech-w e can expect the same level of unemE loyment at the end of thisfinancialyear as we ave at the moment-5. 4 per cent of the work force. That is the sort of problem we are facing. While other countries with similar problems are moving and adapting to the situation with all sorts of structural adjustment programs, this country is being left further and further behind. This Government beheves that one day some great miracle will occur and everybody will be put back to work. The Government forgets that we are facing new economic problems in the search for the recipe to overcome the unemployment problem. The Government is trying to condition us. It is saying that full employment is a myth. It existed for 20 or 30 years but no one in Australia should really expect us to get back to full employment because, as I say, this is a government of privilege which beUeves that the privileged can live a Uttle better if there is a pool of unemployment and that perhaps it can use this pressure group of unemployed to keep those in work regimented. That is not the accepted phtiosophy of those on this side of the House. When the Government goes to the polls, whether it be at the end of this year, or in May or November of next year, we know now from the Budget that there wtil be massive unemployment and every honourable member on the Government sideMr Sullivan-When do you think?",75
195,Mr YOUNG,"I shaU deal with the National Country Party in a minute. The honourable member has been so quiet since his friend from Hume has been away and one would have expected better manners from him. Let us compare what honourable members are saying about cattle with what they are saying about people. In that way we can expose the fallacies of the poUcies of the Country Party. Throughout the advanced Western world 40 per cent of the unemployed are under 25 years of age; that is, seven million young people in the most developed regions of the Western world are looking for jobs. Australia is no exception. In many ways we are leading. Let us look at the most recent figures that have been published in various surveys or at figures given by the Australian Bureau of Statistics or the Commonwealth Employment Service. In the Melbourne Age quite recently we find that in the 15 to 19 years bracket there are 42,000 males looking for jobs and 45,000 females; in the 20 to 24 years bracket 33,000 males and 24,000 young women are looking for jobs. This is a major problem in this country which has been ignored by the Budget. Mr Sullivan-TeU the truth.",77
196,Mr YOUNG,"My friend the honourable member from the Country Party has come in here to provoke me into telling him what is going on in the country. The Country Party delights the ParUament by talking about trees and animals. It is only since the Australian Labor Party has taken up the cudgels on behalf of country people and since the Australian Cattlemen's Union has been formed that this Government has taken any notice of the mtiitancy which is growing in country areas about something being done because of what is happening. Let us look at what happens in the country and at the number of young people who are out of work in country districts. Why does not the Country Party raise these matters? In Albury 45 per cent of those unemployed are under 25 years of age; in Armidale it is 46 per cent; in Bathurst it is 39 per cent; in Bega 38 per cent; in Casino 32 per cent; in Cessnock 45 per cent; in Charlestown 52 per cent; in Coffs Harbour 33 per cent; in Cowra 42 per cent; in Dubbo 41 per cent; and so the percentage go on right through the country districts of New South Wales. We find that over 40 per cent and, in some cases, over 50 per cent of people who are unemployed are under 25 years of age. This Government has done absolutely nothing about the matter. It has said: 'We wtil spend $102m on the various programs which we have going. We hope that the additional money we are putting in from the Budget wtil put 15,000 people between the ages of 15 and 24 back to work'. But 145,000 people between the ages of 15 and 24 are looking for a job. This Government says: 'We have put hi enough money for 15,000 people'. So the other 130,000 can continue to walk around the countryside and have their number added to by the massive number of school leavers who wtil hit the labour market later this year. The Country Party does not give a damn about the young people out of jobs in country areas, Because of this and other issues which are emerging in the countiyside, there wtil be wholesale revolt at the next election, not only in the suburbs of the cities but also in country areas because those areas are being badly represented. Their voice is not being heard. Beef producers are concerned not only about their industry but also about their chUdren and their opportunities. They are not sacrificing everything to send their chUdren to school knowing that when they complete their studies they will be the dole queues. It is not just the sons and daughters of Labor Parry supporters who cannot find jobs. This situation cuts across all classes, regions. It is about time the Government was cognisant of the long term, massive problem which is confronting this country. The GovernwUl ment ought to be condemned for the way in which it has ignored the problem in its Budget. Let us look at the metropolitan area. One can understand a conservative government ignoring the massive working class districts of the cities because it does not care about them and it does not represent them. As such the government not relate to those areas; it does not them. Right throughout the cities onefindsthat it is a Labor district the Government does care about it. Let us look at the massive unemtion ployment among young people in the metropolileft tan areas. In Leichhardt 575 young men and young women are unemployed. Other figures are: MarrickvUle, 489 and 466; Liverpool, 1,299 and 1,281; Campsie, 660 and 572; Bondi, 455 and 532; Hurstville, 710 and 635; and Fairfield, 731 and 833. We can go through every major suburb in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and Adelaide and Perth and we will find that the greatest poUtical and social problem we have almost totally ignored by this conservative government whUe so many governments overIt seas-the British, French, ItaUan, Scandinavian and American-ar e experimenting with a multiside pUcity of ideas such as early retirement, a shorter working week, and subsidised work for young people. All sorts of innovative schemes are being introduced throughout the Western world in an effort to overcome this problem. This Fraser Administration between 11 tors November 1975 and 13 December you getridof the Labor Government rid of all the problems'. That was the Governwant ment's policy. That is why the Government was elected. Now there are 100,000 more unemployed than there were when Mr Fraser was speech elected on 13 December 1975. Over 50 per cent of the young people who leave school in the country districts in 1977 will not be able to find employment. So if the honourable member for Riverina ( Mr SulUvan) wants to make himself popular with his constituents I suggest that he go back to Griffith, to Leeton, to Balranald and to all those towns and teU the people in them that 50 per cent of their kids will not be able to find jobs. That is the result of the Fraser Government. The whole Budget has been a hoax. There has been massive confusion about whom it affects. All of a sudden we can see through it. We know in exacdy whom it affects. It means that average weekly earners will pay more tax. It means that employment opportunities for people leaving allcolleges and schools throughout Australia have been reduced to virtually ml. A lot of people who have been trained to do certain academic work be doing labouring work because the promises made by this Government and the ambitions which they set themselves during the educational process cannot be met. It does not have any idea. It should be condemned for the way in which it has presented this Budget to the Australian people. The Budget will be the springboard for does throwing this Government out of office.",77
197,Mr DONALD CAMERON ,"Griffith) if (5.35)-The honourable member for Port not Adelaide ( Mr Young) made absolutely no menof the legacy that the previous Government Australia. He did not mention inflation. If 546 ever there were an acknowledgement by an opposition that a government has come to grips with and is defeating the cause of so many of the problems of this nation, it was his silence. The fact that the inflation rate was about 16.7 per cent when the previous Government stepped out is now about 10 per cent escaped him completely. That is an indication that the present is Government is getting the ship back on course. We inherited a ship that had been gutted by fire. is not easy to rebuUd a ship that has been almost destroyed. I am not one of those on this of the House who say: 'Look at what we inherited. We have an excuse forever'. The Opposition fails to acknowledge that this Government is making progress. The honourable member referred to the level of unemployment and to our Umited ability to reduce taxation. These facare a direct result of the rate of inflation, the 1975 said: 'If were left. Itand uncertainty is the lack of confidence which we little wonder that he walks out of you will get the chamber. It is little to hear the truth. wonder that he does not The shallow honourable member made a to impress his electorate. He spoke as if the Labor Party was the only party in Australia which regarded itself as being concerned for the less fortunate in our society. It does not have a monopoly on that concern. If members of the Opposition feel that honourable members on this side of the House have no compassion for the unemployed, they are wrong. We care. The situation that we inherited, which required having to attend carefully to the economy, has prolonged the task of reducing the level of unemployment. I beheve that the return of stability, the return of confidence and the defeat of inflation will return Austraha to the conditions which existed when the Labor Government took office. The Australia which it took over after Mr MCMahon's Government was defeated, despite some of the minor ills which it was suffering, was in comparison a very healthy Australia. The level of unemployment was 130,000 or 140,000. We had not had projected afigureof 300,000 unemployed before those three destructive years. The honourable member for Port Adelaide spent a lot of time talking about taxation and how the benefits would accrue to only a few. The first point I make is that 225,000 Australians are presentiy paying income tax will, because of the recent Budget, in future be exempt from ing income tax. The minimum taxable income has been lifted. That has benefited almost 230,000 AustraUans. Yettisteningto the honourtem able member one would think that the Governatmosphere ment had doubled the income tax rate. Furtherthere more, he referred to the new system which will be introduced. I must draw to his attention the back a lot. fact that the Henderson report on poverty- a document often quoted by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr E. G. Whitlam) when he was Prime Minister-state d that Austraha should have income tax scheme of a simphfied kind, involvWhitlam ing a standard rate of tax plus surcharges people who have high incomes. The honourable member said that we give to people on higher incomes a greater tax rehef than we do to people on lower incomes. I am pleased to say that not members of the Opposition indulge in this pracit tice. Everybody knows that under the present scheme, the one which the Labor Party retained and the one which fed Laborfires-it wanted inflation in this country-the more people's wages rose the more taxation rose and the more Labor could irresponsiblyfinanceits programs and pohcies without giving a the money was coming from.",78
198,Mr HODGMAN ,Spen d it like water.,79
199,Mr DONALD CAMERON,"As the honourto a able member for Denison said, spend it like water. The taxation contribution of Mr and Mrs the Working Australia was increased by 89 per cent person in those three years.",79
200,Mr YOUNG ,What did you say when I went out?,79
201,Mr DONALD CAMERON,"The honourable member for Port Adelaide is back and is interjecting. Mr Deputy Speaker, would you quell him? He is onfireagain. There was this vast tax rip-off. Yet the honourable member said today that we are assisting the rich and not the poor. The facts are, as we all know, that the people in our society who are well off pay infinitely more tax-thousand s of doUars in many cases. The honourable member for Port Adelaide ( Mr Young) has frequendy complained in this Parliament that when his income was $21,000 a year the tax man was ripping off $9,500. That was almost 50 per cent of what he was earning before his recent increase. That is an example of how those on higher incomes pay such a high proportion of their income in taxation. If there is to be reUef, of course those who pay the greatest amount of taxation wtil get the greater reUef in terms of dollars and cents. We cannot escape the who fact that every working Australian wtil get reUef as a result of this most progressive taxation propaygram which comes into being as from 1 February of next year. Every Australian wtil benefit. The reason why the Labor Party condemns the sysso often is that it is endeavouring to create an of disbeUef and concern so that if is an early election the people wtil not readily recognise that this Government has given Indexation must be taken into account also. A lot of people do not reatise that the Government an has given back millions of dollars that the Government would have collected if it on had stayed in power. When the new scheme is taken in conjunction with indexation, it can be seen that the Fraser Government is giving back to the Austrahan people on an annual basis all about $2,000m a year more than it would have if had not kept its promise of setting about to reform and reduce the income tax scales. That deserves praise. I commend the Treasurer ( Mr Lynch), the Cabinet and this Government for being a government which cares for the people and which is determined to carry out its promises. So much for the honourable member for thought to where Port Adelaide. I take the opportunity in this debate to make some reference to the reply of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs ( Mr MACKellar) question about the entry into Australia of Domenico Barbara. Earlier this year I expressed view that Mr Grassby was a most unsuitable to hold down the position of Commissioner for Community Relations. Events in recent weeks have confirmed that I am not alone in holding that view. The spectacle of hundreds of residents of the western New South Wales town of Griffith booing and hooting Mr Grassby during an interview on the David Frost Show an unparalleled indication of pubhc contempt towards the Commissioner by people who knew the man whom so many people talk about so suspicion unfavourably. After all, he was their member the State ParUament and later in the Federal ParUament for many years. Who would know him better than they. Newspaper headlines this week and an answer given by the Mmister for Immigration ing provide even more grounds for concern about Mr Grassby's suitability to hold down even a clerk's job in the PubUc Service, let alone the position of a $44,000 a year commissioner who is supposed to mediate in cases in which alleged that racial overtones might exist. It would seem unfair to seize upon the conflict in the transcripts of the various radio interviews and the newspaper reports of has or has not said in relation to the Barbaro case. If he has not kept photocopies mentation in relation to this case- I beUeve he has-h e has a magnificent memory, considering that as a Minister he handled half a mtition He has stated: ' Mr Barbaro was aUowed to come to Australia to visit his dying mother'. was more than three years ago. I am sure that every honourable member would share my hapincreased piness at the fact that the elderly Mrs Barbaro, Uving in Adelaide, is still aUve and well. But Mr Grassby did say that the decision to aUow entry was made following a departmental recommendation. This morning the Mmister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in effect informed the House that his Department has strenuously advised Mr Grassby that deported Domenico Barbaro, who is currendy serving 14 to 18 years in prison in Italy, should not be lowed to re-enter Australia because of his crimime nal background. Mr Grassby stated yesterday also that Mr Barbaro was shadowed by pohce during his brief visit to Australia. My inquiries have estabUshed that Mr Barbaro was not was shadowed by Commonwealth Police as claimed. It would seem that Mr Grassby, in an effort appease the whims and desires of either a person whom he sees as holding an important position in the world or an international organisation, agreed under the guise of compassion ately to override the strong advice given to him as the Minister not to allow the entry to Australia of a person who can only be described as highly caused it. undesirable. The clouds over the head of Mr Grassby continue td gather and to darken. It time action was taken to investigate fully the man so that the doubts wbich exist in my mind and in the minds of millions of AustraUans are was either confirmed or dispeUed. If Mr Grassby's activities are beyond reproach his family and he deserve to have the heavy veU of current pubUc lifted. I sincerely hope that the Minister in in charge of the Commissioner's responsibUities wtil set about urgently to settle once and for all the suspicions surrounding the background and the activities of the man who holds down the very important position of Commissioner for this mornCommumty Relations. In the remaining minutes of my contribution to this debate I wish to refer to the Auditor General's annual report, which was tabled yesterday, in which it was alleged that approxiit is mately $60m had been paid out accidently by the Department of Social Security. I wish to refer also to the allegations of a Public Service union that this problem was caused mainly because of what Mr Grassby staff shortages. Mr Brown-Why should that be said? It is a lot of the docuof nonsense.",79
202,Mr DONALD CAMERON,"The honourable cases. member for Diamond Valley-the y caU him 'Sparkles' these days-sai d that it is a lot of nonsense. I agree with him because, as was pointed That out today by the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser), the staff in the Department has been by some 900 persons in recent months. Its need for staff to carry a greater work load was reasonably met to a very large degree. The matter I wish to report to the House is my concern in recent months at having received a number of phone caUs from constituents who have said: ' Mr Cameron, I have been back at work for a month. I have advised the Department that I am back at work but my cheques conaltinue to come'. In some cases constituents told that they had been told by some careless pubUc official-this was very careless indeed-that they should just bank the cheque and forget about it. Heaven forbid! It was their money that being given away as well as the money of the honourable member for Hunter ( Mr James), who is attempting to interject, myself and everyto body else. The most distressing part was that these people who said: ' I have told them twice and nothing has happened', were honest people has who realised that they did not deserve the deUbercheques but still they came.",80
203,Mr JAMES ,You reduced the staff; that is what,80
204,Mr DONALD CAMERON,"I reject that very is simplistic explanation from the honourable member for Hunter. Such was my concern that I tried to contact the head of the Department Social Security in Queensland. He was not availthat able at the time but I gave his secretary an example of the problem and said: ' I am not so much interested in this particular case, but I plead with you and request that you look at the system which allows this to continue because that is what needs attention'. It was a screaming, squeaking wheel and it needed oil. If the Departestablished. ment was so busy- I do not accept that it that it was not looking for the reasons for the errors which caused so many people to report see that they were continuing to receive not just one cheque but two for which they were not eligible, to a degree it was irresponsible. The Government has altered the system in this Budget to make unemployment benefits payable in arrears rather than in advance. Unfortunately, a lot of fears have been created in the commumty that this will mean that those rendy receiving a benefit will have a fortnight's payment wiped off and will have to wait a whole month for their next cheque. That is not true. Those people who when the Budget was preCameron). sented were receiving a benefit under the old tem will continue to receive that benefit under the old system. Like the honourable member for Diamond Valley and others, I hope that those people who are currendy unemployed will not unemployed for much longer. The new system relates to the future. It simply means that if a person is unemployed qualify for the unemployment benefit and in about a fortnight his first cheque wdl be received; then it will be another fortnight the next cheque comes. Under the old system person would wait about 2Vi weeks to 3 weeks for his first cheque and then four orfivedays later another cheque would arrive. So he was really receiving a double payment. That is how unemployed people were being paid in advance. The new system will not cause that much ship. When we see an amount of $60m overpaid I am sure that every thinking taxpayer and every thinking unemployed person who is hoping to back into the work force as quickly as possible become a taxpayer again would agree that the old system was very much in need and alteration. I do want to commend the Government on its recent Budget. Regrettably, politics being tics, when the pubhc listens to our debates m hament they hear one speaker who does not have a good word to say about the Budget and then they hear a speaker from the other side of the House saying what a marvellous Budget it is that everything about it is good. I concede, as of Government member, that many of the things the Government wished to do could not be done this year or at this time; but I swear that what has been done is to the benefit of all Australians in the immediate term and in the future. I referred to the inheritance we received when we took back government as being a ship gutted by fire. Our economic structure is being reI am quite confident that, with the was- responsible attitude and good management which have been brought to government, we will in the not too distant future the ship to which we all belong sailingfirmlyahead and still in the hands of a responsible and capable government.",80

210,Mr STEWART ,"Lang) (8.0)-The honourpohable member for Griffith ( Mr Donald Cameron) Parfinished speaking before the suspension of the sitting for dinner. He said that when the Labor Party took over government at the end of 1972 it was left with minor ills by the previous Liberaland Country Party Government. I suggest that he a look at history. One of the main reasons we were left with major ills was the fact that from 1969 1974 the Liberal Party had four leaders. In 1969 Senator John Gorton resigned from the Senate contest the leadership of the Liberal Party the Prime Ministership- a clear indication that this House at that time there was not one ber of the Liberal Party who had the ability become Prime Minister of Austraha. Sir John Gorton was Prime Minister from 1969 to some time in 1971 when on an even vote in the Liberalcapital Party rooms he was deposed. He stood down from his office. His place was taken by the right honourable member for Lowe ( Sir William that MCMahon). He lasted until after the 1972 eleca tion. Then you, Sir, took over leadership then Opposition. You lasted until after the 1974 election. are down in history as saying: T have no troublesof with my leadership. All my colleagues would walk over hot coals for me.'

214,Mr STEWART,"I withdraw whatever reflection I made. In 1975, after a very strange set of of Those circumstances leading up to that present Prime Minister assumed office. One of They the honourable members he appointed to his towards Ministry was the honourable member for Curtin interests ( Mr Garland). Shortly after his appointment to and the Ministry he resigned because he was under a cloud. I understand from good authority that he had a definite promise of reinstatement to the Ministry. But when the next vacancy in the Minblame istry occurred, the present Minister for Proopen ductivity, the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr MCPhee) was appointed. The honourable the member for Farrer ( Mr Fife), now the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, was number appointed to the next vacancy. It was not until the third vacancy in the Ministry occurred that the honourable member for Curtin was reapUnion pointed. He had been discharged by a court the Prime Minister still made him serve his states: 18-month sentence. Because of the warfare going on in the Liberal an Party between 1969 and late 1972 the economy of to was allowed to run down. Members of the Liberal Party were more interested in the leadership to battle and betraying each other. Between 1965 and and 1972 the economy gotrightout of control. in The multinationals were running our country. memThere were no guideUnes on overseas investto ments. There was no control of the ownership of our resources. People are now recognising that in 1965 we were over-producing. Too much foreign was coming mto the country. Unemployment and inflation had already commenced. When the honourable member for Griffith states in 1972 when Labor took office we had only few minor Uls I suggest again that he look at the of the economic record between 1965 and 1972. Many honourable members on both sides of You the House have spoken during the Budget debate the need for co-operation between government, employers and employees. The Government side of the House places the blame for everything on the unions and the workers. Bob Hawke's most conciliatory statements are answered by the Prime Minister and other Ministers with insults. The Deputy Leader of the Country Party ( Mr Sinclair) is now infamous for his remarks about the British disease. So that I do not misquote him I shall read from his speech to the South Australian Branch of the National Country Party on 5 August 1977. He said: While on the subject of industrial disputes I must also the fact that so many British migrants seem bent on importing the 'British disease' into the Australian trade union movement. people have obviously sapped much of the strength British industiy, leaving the British economy one of the election, the weakest in Europe. are seemingly adopting the same atutudes and views the Australian trade union movement. Their are not Australia, their origins are not Australian, them. one wonders whether acdon should not be taken against I note that he has toned down his remarks in the last few days. I suggest that unionists are not to for all the diseases of Australia today. The confrontation by this Government and the Queensland Government will be responsible for blood on our streets if this ever happens. I shall place on record some statistics on the of trade unionists in our work force. The reference is a document issued by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in June 1977 headed 'Trade Statistics: Austraha December 1976'. In but that document the definition of trade unions For the purpose of the statistics a trade union is defined as organisation, consisting predominantly of employees, the principal activities of which include the negouauon of rates pay and conditions of employment for its members. The total number of employees in the Australian work force at May 1977- 1 obtained these figuresviolent from the Parliamentary Library this eveningworkers was 6,199,500. This is made up of 3,994,900 males and 2,204,600 females. According to the document from which I read the membership of unions in December 1976 was 1,950,600 males and 841,300 females, and total of 2,791,900. From December 1975 to December 1976 there ment. was a decline in male union membership of 0.8 per cent, and the same percentage decline pUed in female union membership, making a decline in union membership of 0.8 per cent 12 months of 1976. The percentages are well worth citing. In 1976 63 per cent of males and per cent of females in the work force were in trade unions, the total number of persons in the work force in trade unions being 57 per cent. That means that 43 per cent of the 6,199,500 persons in the Austrahan work force are not in trade union covering their calling. Forty-three per cent of them do not contribute to a fighting fund; they do not attend a stop meedng or a union meedng; they do not vote in union election; a number of those 43 per cent claim that industrial action is their union being communist controlled, undemocratic or inefficiently managed, yet they complain about their rates of pay and conditions of employment. But those same 43 per cent who towards are not in a trade union will accept any increase in pay, any reduction in working hours, I see improved sick leave, longer annual holidays, ter long service leave, improved retirement benefits, safer working conditions, improved amenities at their work place, and more pleasant and comfortable workmg conditions. Some of my previous remarks apply also to people who are in a union but who take no part at all in management or control of their union. If there anything wrong with our trade unions it is by the apathy of many unionists who are active unionists, but more particularly it is caused by non-unionists in our work force, not by the importation of any ethnic disease. This is the second Budget introduced by the Treasurer ( Mr Lynch). In the Budget the can Government is claiming a great deal of credit the success of the first Budget. But the real ition is very much to the contrary. There are more complaints from all sections of the comcapitalism munity than there were during the whole of the Labor Government's reign. Honourable memStreet bers on the Government benches laugh. They laugh because they do not mix with the people their electorates. They are not even game to mix with the primary industry leaders or manufacturing industry leaders. There is more complaint in the community today from and unionists, employers organisations, manufacturers, farmers, small business men, educationists, environmentaUsts, State governments, local governments, migrants and recipients of social security benefits than there ever was during the three years of Labor GovernIt is because this Government that came in on a host of promises has not kept pace with the apexpectations of the Austrahan people. in the Much of the worthy and long outstanding social legislation introduced by the Labor 47 Government has been curtaUed or allowed to stagnate. Fraser's federalism has not been accepted by the State governments. The Australian Assistance Plan and grants for leisure facUities have been canceUed and the co-operation of a local government has been lost. Labor's welfare programs were meant to be on a continumg basis. They certainly would have been amended and improved with experience of their operation, workbut they were not designed to be turned on and aoff like a tap. On 25 February 1976 in my speech m the Address-in-Reply debate, at page 300 of useless; they talk ofHansard, I said: I suggest to all honourable members opposite that they should recognise that this country is already heading an unemployment figure of between 500,000 and 750,000 people. no reason at all to change my prediction bebetcause this Government still has the same disastrous policies it commenced in January 1976. The determination of the Government to attain what the Treasurer calls its first goal-to mamtain the underlying trend to lower mflation-ca n be tested by the sudden decision to alter the the income tax averaging provisions for rural prois ducers. Let me quote from page 33 of Statement causedNo. 2 attached to the Budget Papers where not under the heading' Assumptions' it says: Apart from the Budget proposals themselves, there will be no new fiscal measures during 1977-78. Not even the Treasurer in his most verbose style suggest that this is not a fiscal change. This for change is made before the ink on the Budget posPapers is even dry. We are heading into the halcyon days of 1965 to 1972, with laissez-faire again taking over, with the pressure groups in the community-the Pitt and Collins farmers-forcin g the Government within a matter of days to introduce a newfiscalmeasure, inwhen there is a clear statement in the Budget enough Papers that there would be no new fiscal the measures during 1977-78. The Government has not turned on the lights. It has created black misery for many workers. It has switched off the confidence of manufacturers and it has blacked out the hopes and aspirations of young Austraha. Suspension of Standing Orders Motion (by Mr Nixon)-by leave-agree d to: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended would prevent the Prime Minister speaking for a period exceeding 45 minutes.",82
215,Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,"Wannon-Prime per Minister) (8.19)-The honourable member for Lang ( Mr Stewart) has just concluded what one must certainly judge, by the standards of the Opposition, to be a good fighting speech for the position. I think that the House quaUty of the Opposition's contribution to the debate on the Budget by that speech. words one could use of it would be that humdrum, slighdy duU and not particularly people accurate. The Budget brought down by the Treasurer ( Mr Lynch) consolidates and advances the achievements which the Government has already made in fighting inflation and restoring healthy economy to Australia. For the second time, we have a Budget which reduces the deficit by over half a bUUon dollars,firmlycontrols rate of increase in Government spending, creates the conditions for a further reduction inflation and further economic growth. At the same time it increases assistance to those need. Because the Government held its spending within zero real growth as was predicted beginning of this calender year, Australia could afford a major tax reform, under wage and salary earner's take-home pay from 1 February. As a result of this tax reform, taxpayers will save $406m this year. Together with tax indexation, their tax savings this will total $ 1,371m. In 1978-79, taxpayers will save $ 1,390m from the tax reform. Together with $467m from half tax indexation, they will be saving $ 1,857m. Had there reform, the benefits to taxpayers would have been $973m less in 1978-79. This reform was achieved whUe at the same time maintaining our commitment to protect pensions against inflation. In their desperation, Labor tried to conceal the benefits of this Budget from the Australian people. It pretended were no tax cuts at all. I have a simple offer make to those members of the Opposition who claim to disbelieve the reality of the tax cuts. them volunteer to refund their supposedly nonnew existent tax cuts to consoliated revenue. By doing so, they wiU make thefirstcontribution that any of them ever has made to lowering the size of the deficit. Had this Budget's tax reforms not been so fundamental, one might have sympathised a Uttle with the Opposition's unwillingness to admit that major tax reforms could be made. Under the as Hayden reforms a taxpayer without dependants, not whose concessional allowances had been equal to 10 per cent of his net income, paid $60, or 17.6 cent more tax in 1975-76 if his income was $4,000, socking the person with $4,000 income an extra 17.6 per cent. But if his income was $5,000 he paid $ 120, or 21.8 per cent more tax. If Ophis income was $6,000 he paid $212, or 26.2 per can judge the cent more in tax.",84
216,The kindest Mr BAUME ,That is not the rich.,84
217,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,"No, he socked at the lowest end of the income scales and quite deUberately increased their tax. Some reform-som e Treasurer. The Hayden scheme hit the farmer particularly hard. In fact, many farmers withfluctuatingincomes paid more tax a under the Hayden system with its misnamed general concessional rebate than wage earners with the same average income. Let me give one the example. Under the pre-Budget scale, the and indexed Hayden scale, a wage earner on an in income of $10,000 would pay $2,147 a year tax. A farmer who had been on that income for some most inyears and who then had income of nothing, $20,000 and $10,000, maintaining an average income of $10,000 as was the wage earner, would pay a total of $1,467 more tax than the at the wage earner in a three year period.",84
218,which every Mr BAUME ,Disgraceful .,84
219,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,"The honourable gentleman has used the word 'disgraceful'. It should be conceded that under the so-called year Hayden tax reforms, all taxpayers did have something to look forward to-taxe s which continually increased, because the Whitlam Government would not even commit itself to indexing its been no new tax new tax rates. Over the past few months, the perpetrators of that tax hoax have enlightened us with further examples of theirfinegrasp of basic economic principles. At the Perth Australian Labor Party Conference, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr E. G. Whitlam), in a blindingflashof insight, there uncovered a novel intellectual conceptto 'economic responsibiUty'. This had unfortunately evaded him for the three years in which he Let was in government. The strain of grasping this idea was so great that once he had given his speech and the Labor Party began its economic debate, the Leader of the Opposition proceeded to read the newspapers and ignore what had happened. Having thus rested, he returned to fray a few weeks later, on 20 July, at the National Press Club. He put forward the Labor Party's new economic plan-mor e government spending and a larger deficit. What a revoluthat tionary break with Labor tradition that was. Unfortunately, he spoiled it all by concluding that 'Labor offers Australia a long haul back prosperity'. The Australian people know fectly well how long that haul would be. Then on 11 August, just three weeks later, Labor unveiled with great fanfare its so-called 'Proposal to get Austraha working again'. Its authors were the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Oxley ( Mr Hayden) - someho w the shadow Treasurer was lost in the shuffle. This document declared that 'it should not be represented as an alternative Budget, but expected. rather as a set of measures to be included in the Budget'. This modesty was becoming-bu t then no party has more to be modest about. It certribution tainly was not an alternative Budget. What sought was an increased expenditure of $800m. Taken together with Labor's opposition to our policies to restrain government expenditure, clear that they were contemplating a deficit $3.5 btilion or more-at the least a 50 per increase over the $2.2 bilUon we have budgeted for this year, a deficit which would bring higher interest rates and higher inflation. The Opposition now says such huge expendicompletely ture on Government programs is the only way knows of reducing unemployment. But in 1975 the honourable member for Oxley had to terminwas ate a scheme strikingly similar to this so-called new proposal-the notorious Regional ment and Development scheme. Labor terminated the RED scheme because it was inefficient and ineffective- a scheme which cost $180m but employed an average of only 13,000 people. The Labor Party's proposal is in the finest tradition of Labor economics-it holds the prospect of gravely damaging Australia. The next step in the Opposition's carefully thought out economic offensive took place a lars week later, after the Budget. On 18 August, Leader of the Opposition, and Labor's jointdivided shadow Treasurers, the honourable member for Adelaide ( Mr Hurford) and the ment honourable member for Oxley, held a very instructive Press conference. It showed the Labor Party's superb approach to economic poUcy three years. making, the machine-like precision with which the Labor Party's economic manager and Opposition shadow Treasurer work together. The honourable member for Oxley said that the Labor Party the had no commitment to personal tax indexation, but the honourable member for Adelaide admitted that personal tax indexation was Labor Party pohcy. The honourable member for Oxley said the Labor Party did not commit itself to our tax reforms, but the honourable member for Adelaide seemed to rule out the scheme entirely. to The honourable member for Oxley said that he percould make some definite calculations, a remarkable admission. The honourable member for Adelaide, even more remarkably, said he could not. One commentator who was present was unkind enough to say that 'Messrs Whitlam, Hayden and Hurford resembled not so much the three wise monkeys as Donald Duck's nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louey'. WeU, after aU, the Labor Party has been living in fantasyland for so long that a touch of unreality was only to be But the high spot of the Labor Party's conto economic theory and practice had it not yet been reached. The climax-the great moment-wa s the Leader of the Opposition's reply to the Budget- a reply which contained it is nothing constructive, nothing of substance, of which had forgotten the economic plan of some cent days before. It was a reply that some people described as full oftiredand empty rhetonc. The Leader of the Opposition's speech was full of yesterday's delusions-yesterday' s words uttered by yesterday's man. But to dismiss the speech as devoid of meaning is to ignore the it Leader of the Opposition's most revealmg remark, that Labor's alternative to the Budget 'implicit' in aU that he had been saying; impUcit m aU his criticisms of our restraint m Employspending Australian's tax doUars. It is clear that the Leader of the Opposition wants a return to the days when government spending was utterly unrestrained. He wants a return to the unrealistic and destructive poUcies that Labor pursued for three years. In its econoutomic plan it was spending an extra $800m. If in all the programs he criticised in his speech in this Budget debate he was going to spend more dolagain, how many hundreds of millions of the doUars more than that $800m would he have E sured out on to the market over the period? The abor Government's poUcies increased governexpenditure by 115 per cent. Those poUcies resulted in unemployment being trebled in one year and the rate of mflation being trebled in At the National Press Club the Leader of the said that the Labor Government had made mistakes. That was modest. He said that the Austrahan Labor Party henceforth would walk the path of economic responsibihty. What responsibihty? He and the party he leads are economic incompetents. That is why the Auscharges trahan people voted them into opposidon. That is why the Austrahan people will keep them in opposidon.",84
220,Mr LES MCMAHON ,Nam e the date elecuon.,86
221,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,"We will see how bold the Opposition is when the day comes. In this Budget we again have re-examined GovernAustraUans ment programs to ensure that funds raised taxpayers are being used with the greatest efficiency and to the greatest effect. All traUans have a big stake in making government more efficient and less costly, for efficient ment means stronger and more highly motivatedreform government and lower taxation for all Auspersonal traUans. The Budget represents a major step making government more efficient and achieving the lowest taxation possible, consistent with sound and strong government. Through our efforts in reappraising governand ment programs, we have held the real rate of growtn in government spending to zero. That is income. what the Treasurer predicted and promised many months ago. Yet at the sametimewe have provided large increases in payments to the States and local government. In those States which have already brought down their Budgets we can see the benefit of our generosity, because they all have made very substantial concessions and basicaUy have not increased taxes. They this Budget. could not have done it had it not been for the increased financial reimbursement grants from the Commonwealth. At the same time we have given high priority mentioned to programs for relieving unemployment, especially for the young. The financial Umit is off there those programs. If there is a training oppormarginal tunity, it wtil be provided. There is increased earned. social security and welfare 13 per cent. The Budget gives high priority to prehensivethe providing effective assistance to need. The automatic adjustment of social ity pensions and benefits will result in increases accord with the Mathews Committee's in November, and again in May 1978, and reclusion patriation disabiUty pensions and Service pentax sions wtilrisein the same way. We have achieved all this, and reformed the tax scales, without increasing postal charges or the duties on beer, decisions. spirits and cigarettes.",86
222,Mr LES MCMAHON ,You are a fraud.,86
223,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,"Does the honourable member for Sydney want the tax on beer increased? Let him say that in his electorate. This is the second consecutive Budget in which these have not been increased. That should be contrasted with Labor's record. It increased indirect taxes in two out of its three Budgets. As a result, in 1975-76 collections of indirect taxes were $2.2 bilUon-abou t 90 per cent greater than of the they had been in 1972-73. It was our firmness in restraining government expenditure which enabled the Government to introduce substantial cuts in personal income tax. want to have greater freedom to frommake their own decisions about spending and saving, and this Government is committed to Ausproviding the conditions under which the best efforts of all wtil be encouraged-no t stifled by govern-excessive taxes. That is why we promised to the tax system. Last year we brought in tax indexation and major reforms for in corporate taxpayers. This year we have made the most revolutionary change yet made to Australia's system of personal income tax. The new personal taxation measures restore the incentive to work harder and more productively to earn more. They give people the power to decide how to spend a greater proportion of their The new tax system accords with the views of most taxation poUcy experts. The Labor Government received many reports from committees, commissions and task forces bearing on taxation pohcy. Overwhelmingly, they support the main features of the personal tax system introduced in The new tax system's first feature is that there are tax cuts for people at aU income levels-ther e are none of the detriment cases of the kind I and for the in relation to the Hayden tax scalesvast majority of fuUtimeworkers is also a reduction m the excessively high tax rates; that is, a reduction in the extra tax payable on each extra dollar of income These changes accord with the main spending. It is up by finding of Asprey Committee-the most comreview of Australia's taxation system those most in for 40 years-that the securtoo heavily on personalAustralian income tax system relies tax. The changes conthatrisingmarginal tax rates encourage avoidance and evasion and may lead to substantial economic waste because tax avoidance becomes a basis of investment and employment The House will, I hope, recall that the ACTU's industrial advocate was a member of the Mathews Committee. The new tax system, by fostering skill and encouraging the acceptance of responsibihty, heeds the warning of the Jackson Committee that a society 'neglects at its peril rewards for skill and responsibihty'. The Jackson Committee concluded: We have a general impression that reward differentials after tax are decreasing, and may no longer be sufficient encourage individual effort and enterprise rn industry. The House will recall that the President of the ACTU and of the ALP was one of the authors of that report. The new system's second feature is that it introduces a tax-free area at the base of every taxpayer's income of $3,750, or about $72 a week. This replacement of the so-called general concessional rebate introduced in the Hayden Budget of 1975 accords with the Asprey Committee's recommendations. Just a few months before the previous Government introduced the notoriously misleading general concessional rebate, the Asprey Committee had described such rebates as confusing. It reported: The amount of tax to be levied on low incomes should not be obscured by artificialities. Artificialities were what the Opposition's last Budget was all about-artificialitie s that tried to hide the massive tax increases which the Hayden Budget inflicted on many taxpayers on low incomes. There are no such artificialities in this Budget. The new tax system's third feature is that it establishes one tax rate-3 2 per cent-as the basic rate of taxation paid by the vast majority of taxpayers. The Leader of the Opposition's claim that this abandons progressive taxation is completely untrue. Under the new tax system the higher a person's income, the higher the proS ortion he will pay in tax. Because the first 3,750 of everyone's income is tax free, a taxpayer on any given level of income will pay a higher proportion ofhis total income in tax than a taxpayer who has a lower income but whose circumstances are similar in other respects. A taxpayer, with no dependants and no other deductions or rebates, at an income of $5,000 wtil pay 8 per cent of his income in tax; at $ 10,000,20 per cent; at $15,000, 24 per cent; at $20,000, 29 per cent; and at $50,000, 44 per cent. At the same time, under this system 90 per cent of taxpayers pay the same amount of extra tax on each extra dollar of income. This principle was supported by Professor Henderson's Commission of Inquiry into Poverty and by the Priorities Review Staff report on social welfare pohcy. Moreover, the Asprey Committee took the following view: Over the middle band ofincome and wealth, the band in which the great majority of them spend their lives, most Australians will accept as fair and convenient an approximately proportional taxation system. Fourthly, the new system imposes tax surcharges on taxpayers with the highest incomes but to reduces the rate on the highest incomes from the present 65 per cent to 60 per cent. This also accords with the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty, and 60 per cent was in fact the maximum marginal rate that Professor Henderson suggested. The Asprey Committee went even further, and suggested that an appropriate long term target would be reducing the highest marginal tax scales to 50 per cent. The new tax arrangements are in line with professional opinion on the best tax system for Austraha. Those who clamoured for reductions in marginal tax rates before the Budget, but who now complain because taxpayers on high incomes get the largest reductions, are refusing to face an inescapable fact-the fact that reductions in rates of taxation for those with low taxable income, automatically reduce the taxes paid by those with higher incomes. Those who believe that tax reductions on high incomes should have been less, should tell us at what income levels they believe marginal rates should have been higher. It may be helpful if I mention that the cost to revenue of a reduction of one percentage point is over $300m in respect of the standard rate of tax of 32 per cent, less than $30m in respect of the 46 per cent rate, and about $1 lm in respect of the 60 per cent marginal tax rate. Had the Government rejected the recommendations of expert inquiries and left the maximum marginal tax rate at 65 per cent, at best the amount saved would only have enabled us to reduce further the standard 32 per cent rate of taxation by one-fifth of a percentage point, from 32 per cent to 31.8 per cent. The Opposition's wilful misrepresentation of the tax reforms, its attempts to set Australians against Australians by talking about a 'class Budget', will not alter the fact that all people wtil benefit and, proportionately, people on the lowest incomes will benefit most of all. Taxpayers with a dependent spouse earning $7,000 a year will save 33 per cent in tax. Those earning $8,000 a year will save 25 per cent. On $18,000 a year, they wtil save 20 per cent in tax. Taxpayers whose incomesfluctuatewill be more fairly treated, and primary producers will have the added benefit of the new tax averaging arrangements announced recently by the Treasurer. Primary producers withfluctuatingincomes, who were disadvantaged under the Hayden tax systhe tem, will no longer pay more tax than other payers with the same average income. As the Asprey Committee pointed out, the averaging system has operated harshly on keep farmers with falling incomes. The Government's new tax averaging system will especially assist rates. these farmers. For example, a farmer with taxable income of $4,000 but with an average income of $10,000 would have paid $453 tax under the pre-Budget scale. Under the simplified scale and the new averaging system, his annual tax will be $80-the same as a wage earner an income of $4,000. A farmer with a taxable income of $8,000 but with an average income of $10,000 would have paid $1,583 in tax. Under the new arrangements, his annual tax liability will be $ 1,360, the same as a wage earner with an income of $8,000. This is a reduction of $223 tax. These savings are significant. They will remove the harshness identified by the Asprey Committee which farmers with falling have experienced. At the same time, these measures will have negligible cost in 1977-78, stituting and will therefore not affect the Budget's economic strategy. The new tax system is fairer than any system of personal tax Austraha has had before. The Oppposition's campaign to confuse taxpayers will fail. Taxpayers wtil of course learn about the new tax system in the most direct way. On 1 July 1976 and 1 July 1977, all wage salary earners became aware about tax indexaAll tion when there were reductions in the tax deducted from their pay. On 1 February 1978, there will be another reduction in tax reductions from pay packets. On 1 July 1978 there will yet another reduction in the tax deducted from pay packets, and every wage and salary earner will benefit. Let me emphasise again the simple truth of the historic tax reforms this Budget introduced. No individual taxpayer will lose. Every individual taxpayer will gain. All taxConference. payers are protected against inflation. The Budget brought down by the Treasurer is a Budget in which efficiency and sensitivity in the government administration are at a premium. placed With one decisive stroke, the Budget reforms passing and simplifies the personal tax system in such a at half the way as to benefit everyone, to reward initiative and enterprise for everyone, to encourage harder work and higher productivity by everyone. It further reinforces the constant pressure against inflation which the Government has exerted ever since coming to office. It provides a stimulus economy through a large increase in the distaxposable incomes of all taxpayers, particularly after 1 February when pay-as-you-earn deductions will be reduced. It protects the disadvantaged by increasing pensions and benefits to pace with inflation. The lower deficit sets the scene for lower inflation and lower interest This Budget represents a funher stage in the economic policies we have employed throughout 1976 and 1977. These pohcies wtil continue to establish the sound foundation for sustainable with economic growth and prosperity. Debate (on motion by Mr Willis) adjourned. STATES GRANTS (CAPITAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 1977 Second Reading in Debate resumed from 25 August, on motion by Mr Viner: That the Bill be now read a second time.",86
224,Mr HURFORD ,"Adelaide) (8.47)-On beincomes half of the Opposition I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to subthe following words: 'whilst not opposing the second reading of the Bill, the simpler and House is of the opinion that: (a) it reduces in real terms the funds available to the States, (b) it increases the States' borrowing costs, (c) it forces the States to reduce the services they provide and/or to impose additional taxes and charges, and and (d) it leads to increased unemployment'. those charges apply to the Budget which we have just heard the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) huffing and puffing about and seeking to defend. The States Grants (Capital Assistance) be Bill 1977 authorises the payment of the grants component of the State government Loan Council programs for the currentfinancialyear 1977-78. Almost $500m is involved and this has represents approximately one-third of the total program agreed upon at the 1 July Premiers As well as this amount authority is given for the payment of grants for capital purposes in thisfinancialyear until the passage of authorising legislation for the year. A limit is on the amount of payment which can be made in 1978-79 without further legislation through this Parliament. This limit is set amount of the 1977-78 grants. This legislation is an intrinsic part of the Government's main policy thrusts since assuming office. I see two thrusts. They are tied up with the Government's so-called new federaUsm polto icy and with its supposed main anti-inflationary weapon, namely, cutting government expendiinflation ture. It appears that the progress of new federalGovernment-the ism has been brought to an abrupt halt. The States find themselves unable to agree with mostamount of the Commonwealth's demands. The pohcy vices that was supposed to bring a new era of coState operation in Federal-State relations has brought nothing but acrimony and confusion. We will resources have a further example of this at the forthcomingend Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting which take place shortly. The much vaunted pohcy of giving States dubious freedom to raise their own income tax has been rejected by New South Wales, to mentively tion the people of just one State, who have given that opportunity so far. The people of South Australia will be given an opportunity Saturday and will similarly reject this Governto ment's new federalism pohcy. They will vote in ing, the Dunstan Government by an overwhelming majority. Double taxation was a major issue the New South Wales election and when voters grasped the full import of what the conservatives who are runmng the Commonwealth at the has presenttimewere trying to do, they rejected the Commonwealth's counterpart in the State. This will be the experience in South Austraha and more and more States as people realise how new federalism will affect them. Mr Groom-Is this the best you can do?",88
225,Mr HURFORD,"The Government's attitude to the States can be summarised quite readily. heard an interjection from the honourable memhow ber for Braddon which is an electorate in Tasthrough mania. Since he came into the Parliament, porarily as a oncer, there has been a State tion in Tasmania and the people of Tasmania have overwhelmingly rejected double taxation as they will overwhelmingly reject him at the next opportunity. The Government's attitude to to What the States can be summarised quite readily. butanowhere Under its pohcies the States are to get more and mentioned inistheany more responsibilities and fewer and fewer the resources. The second reading speech of the Minister Aboriginal Affairs and Minister assisting the Treasurer ( Mr Viner) gives the impression that the States will receive a good deal under this Government. He admits that the grants which the are the subject of this Bill have been increased less than 6 per cent. However, he does not spell out that this means a drop in real terms in excessexample, of 6 per cent because in the Government's Budget Papers it admits to an inflation rate of per cent. So if one is getting an increase in terms of only 6 per cent at atimewhen there is an rate of 12 per cent-admitte d by the n there is a drop of 6 per cent in real terms. This means resources of that lesser wtil be applied to the States for the serof the people in those States through the governments. The Minister seeks to alleviate the concern of those interested in the available to the States by adding at the of his speech that the total of general purpose and loan funds is up 14 per cent on last financial year's level. This is another example of what I mentioned in the debate on the Local the Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Amendment Bill. The Government is using selecchosenfiguresto avoid taking responsibeenbihty for what it has actually done. On some occasions itfindsmerit in its policy of cutting on Government spending but when it has to face up the results of cutting that Government spendas it has to do in a Bill such as this, it goes to water and we hear inane interjections from back in bench oncer members of the Parliament. It is undeniable that the present Government cut overall the real level of funds going to the States; that is, the total of loans, general purpose and specific purpose funds haverisenby only 9 in per cent thisfinancialyear compared with the previousfinancialyear. This amounts to a drop in real terms of 2 per cent to 3 per cent. We still hear honourable members on the Government side protesting. I repeat: At some stages the Governmentfindsmerit in cutting Government I spending but when it has to face the real facts of this means reduced services for the people the pubhc sector, then the Government temprotests and pretends that that has not hapelecpened. Honourable members on the Government side misrepresent what the Government is doing for the people of this country. the Government is doing here amounts drop in real terms of 2 per cent to 3 per cent, mention made of this. It is not Budget, it is not mentioned in second reading speech of the Minister and it has not been mentioned on any other occasion for that I can remember. Once again, it is curious that a government so convinced of the necessity for cutting Government spending is not prepared to spell out how it is doing that. The estimate of drop in real terms of 2 per cent to 3 per cent by in funds available to the States probably illustrates the real seriousness of the situation. For last year actual expenditure on specific purpose grants was some $125m less than 12estimated in the Budget. There is no reason to moneysuggest that such an occurrence may not be repeated this year. Specific purpose grants for 1977-78, the currentfinancialyear, have already been cut by some 8 per cent in real terms comhave pared with the previousfinancialyear. It is worth examining some of the areas in which these are being made. Funds for pensioner dwellings are down some 18 per cent in real nal advancement programs are due to lose in real terms in excess of 16 per cent of funds. The pubhc transport allocation has been reduced 25 per cent. Other urban programs such as those for sewerage, land development and growth centres have virtually disappeared. In these areas the States are not to get funds, which they received, totalling in excess of $200m. Total funds going to the States in the current financial year are estimated to be about cent to 20 per cent in money terms above the level of 1975-76. But when account is taken of rise in the price level of 18 per cent to 25 per the treatment which the States have received federalism. from this Administration is put into stark perspective. It is no wonder, with the new federalism policy meaning a reduction of some 5 cent to 7 per cent in the real level of resources available to the States, that the collapse of policy is imminent. Only today the Prime Minister has fuelled speculation of an election this year. There is only one interpretation of that eventuality, that is that the Government is frightened of election next year which is the propertimethat such an election is due. The reason I am prompted to make that remark is that the rudeeper mours around the corridors-the y may even be fact by now and announced publicly-ar e that two Ministers, perhaps the Minister for further Transport ( Mr Nixon) at the table is one of the unfortunates, have been prevented from going on their overseas trips. The Minister shakes head. He is fortunate. He is still going on his jaunt some time soon. Mr Nixon- I do not happen to be proposing to leave this country at all.",89
226,Mr HURFORD,"I shall allow the interjection by the Minister for Transport and say that, temcutting porarily, he is staying in the country. The next Premiers Conference in October has a fundacepted mental dispute to settle before the Commonon wealth can proceed with its plans in this area. Last year the States were expected to get an extra $90m under the tax sharing arrangements to balneed ance their cuts in specific purpose grants. As events turned out, tax receipts extra $90m payment did not eventuate. All the States bar Queensland have been forced into theindependent position where the tax sharing formula was to give them less revenue than the guaranteed minumum determined by reference to the old early 1976. grants formula. Needless to say,fiveof the States done away with this guarantee. As a result the tax sharing formula has been abandoned and cuts there is now a new dispute between the Commonwealth and the States over the form the forterms. Aborigi-mula should take. urban We on this side of the House have pointed out by to the Government manytimesthat its pohcies towards the States involve more confrontation than co-operation. The latest dispute over the reimbursement formula is but one in a long line once of disputes. However, this could be the one which brings the demise of the farce, which is what I call the so-called new federalism pohcy. Unless agreement is reached over a new formula 18 perthe Government's version of federalism is finished. Considering the problems it has caused, a this would probably be the best result all round, cent, namely, the end of this farce known as new At the outset of my speech I said that this Bill per was an intrinsic part of the Government's two main pohcy initiatives. I have already discussed the one relating to Federal-State relations-the new federalism. I turn now to the other, the cutting of government expenditure. Last year, durand ing debate on this Bill's predecessor, I pointed an out that the Government's policy of cutting pubhc expenditure, in particular capital works expenditure, threatened to push the economy into recession. The Government has cera tainly not learned the lesson of the last 12 months, for we have been pushed further and into that recession. For the next financial year funds going to the States for capital works programs are down some 12 per cent in real his terms compared with those presentiy available. This followed substantial cuts in 1976-77. Total capital outlays in the recent Budget have fallen by almost 18 per cent in real terms. It is worth examining what has happened to the economy since the Government's policy of drastically pubhc expenditure has begun to have a substantial impact. It is generally acby independent observers-no t by people this side necessarily-that the levels of pubhc expenditure struck in the last Labor Budget represented a sustainable balance between the for restraint, on the one hand, and the need to help the private sector back torecovery,on the were such that the other hand. Mr Sainsbury-Tell us the names of those observers.",90
227,Mr HURFORD,That Budget was working in Mr Sainsbury-You cannot tell us the names of those independent observers.,90
228,Mr HURFORD,"Independent experts such as the Institute of Apphed Economics, even people such as professors at our various universities and most eminent economists in this country have agreed that the Hayden Budget represented a budget of proper balance between the need to stimulate, on the one hand, and the need to restrain, on the other hand. Mr Sainsbury-Oh !",91
229,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Mr Lucock)-I suggest that the honourable member for Eden Monaro keep his remarks to himself until he is called to make his speech.,91
230,Mr HURFORD,"With the proper balance in that Budget, the result was that until April 1976, before the policies of the Fraser Government were beginning to apply, all the indicators showed improvement. The level of unemployment reduced during those three months. Retail sales increased. Production figures increased. I am grateful for the honourable member's interjection inasmuch as it gives me another opportunity to remind not only the ignorant back bench members of the Fraser Government but also the people of this country that as soon as pohcies of cutting pubhc spending and of restricting the money supply growth to ridiculously low levels began to apply, so unemployment levels turned for the worse. Today the unemployment level is unprecedently high. The economy is in grave stagnation and is in far worse shape than it was 21 months ago when this Government took over. It is becoming increasingly clear to the people of this country that the poor state of the economy, which was accepted to be the case in December 1975, at the time of the election, was due not to policies of the Labor Government but to the world economic crisis which had overtaken all the developed and under-developed nations. MrSainsbury-Oh!",91
231,Mr HURFORD,"That will be said again and again and is another reason why people such as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro will be oncers in Parhament. That realisation is becoming clearer to the people of this nation. The Budget, I repeat, was worlcing early in 1976. However, thefirstLynch Budget, with, amongst other things, its cuts in government capital outIt lays, destroyed the groundwork for recovery built by the 1975-76 Budget. A comparison of a wide range of indicators reveals that the economy in the last six months of 1976-77, when the Fraser Government's pohcies began to apply, was performing much worse than it had during the corresponding period of the previousfinancialyear when the Labor Party was in power. Let me go through these indicators for the record. Non-farm product grew by 3.5 per cent in thefirstsix months of 1976. It fell by 0.6 per cent in the corresponding period of 1977. Personal consumption rose by one per cent in the March and June quarters of 1976. It fell by 1.8 per cent in the same period of 1977. Private capital investment increased by 12.6 per cent in the first half of 1976, compared with a decline of 9.3 per cent in the six months to June 1977.1 do not Uke repeatingfigureafterfigure,but it is necessary for thesefiguresto go into the record where they wtil be used to good effect. They wtil show the people of this countiy that my point is true. My point is that as soon as the Fraser Government's economic policies began to work the indicators turned for the worse. Investment in dwellings rose by 14.3 per cent in the second half of 1975-76 and fell, after the Fraser Government took over, by 10.8 per cent in the half year to June 1977. RetaU sales are stagnant in real terms. In the 12 months to July the 1977 they rose by 11 per cent, compared with a rise in the goods component of the consumer price index of the same order. There was no growth in production during the last year. The Austrahan Bureau of Statistics indices of production for July this year reveal that 17 items had fallen in production during the last year, while only 14 items had risen. The Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd index of factory production in June was at the same level as it was 12 months earlier. Unemployment as measured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics labour force survey had risen by 25 per cent in the six months to last May. The number of registered unemployed with the Commonwealth Employment Service was some 68,000 higher in August of this year than it was in July 1976. Overtime levels at the end of June were no higher than those of 12 months earlier. This slump in activity in early 1977 was emphasised by the recent down-turn readjustment of the forecasts by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development of Australia's growth rate for 1977, from 3.2 per cent to 2 per cent. What a miserable, sorry record that is of the Fraser Government's policies. is quite obvious from these statistics that the Government's economic policies, of which this BUl is an integral part, have had a detrimental effect on the economy. There is no reason to assume that the further cuts in capital outlays nalled by this Bill cannot bring about a further indeed. decline in activity. In fact, that is precisely what will happen. One of the rationale given by Government for its pohcy of cutting back on pubhc spending is that it is simply following pohcy endorsed by the OECD. This is not true. has never been true. It is true that many OECD countries have cut back the rate of growth of real government outlays, but they have not, as this Government has, cut the real level of expenditure. It is worth comparing the attitude of present Australian Government to pubUc capital expenditure with that of the major OECD counwould tries. This Government has been reducing any government capital spending, of which State capital spending is a significant pan, since its Budget. By comparison, the OECD outlook for July shows that in real terms the growth in government capital spending in the second half of 1977 will be 6 per cent in the United States, per cent in West Germany and 18 per cent in first Japan. It is generally recognised that government capital spending is an efficient and effective counter-cyclical tool. It can be increased unemployment is high and reduced when the economy begins to pick up. It is obvious that Australia's performance trying to solve the unemployment problem durinflationary ing the last two years does not compare favourthe ably with that of some overseas countries. Unemcutting ployment in Australia in August was a seasonally adjusted 5.7 per cent of the work force, accorddue ing to the Austrahan Bureau of Statistics labour force survey released as late as today. This is increase of 30 per cent on the level of 18 ago. Contrast this with a fall during the last months of 3 per cent, one per cent and one cent in the total number of unemployed in United States, Japan and West Germany respecsome tively. It is no coincidence that these three countransport-canno tries are following a pohcy of level of government capital expenditure.",91
232,Mr HODGMAN ,This has nothing to do with BUl.,92
233,Mr HURFORD,"Governmen t capital expenwithin diture is what this BUl is aU about. It is obvious that unless the present Government changes its attitude to public sector capital spending, especially that involving State programs, 100,000 young people who will join the work force at the end of this year will find very jobs to meet them. If the performance of the Government over the next six months is anything like that of the past six months those estimates of sigunemployment of 430,000 wiU be conservative A Utde earlier today I quoted from an opinion the of Professor Warren Hogan, who is one of the Government's advisers, that the level of unema ployment would not be 430,000 as I have just It mentioned but 500,000, or 8 per cent of the work force. As I mentioned earUer also, a cut in pubUc spending in general and a cut in the real level of funds to the States in particular has been the pubhc cornerstone of the Government's anti-inflationary pohcy. When the cost of this strategy the in terms of higher unemployment is measured many people would argue that the strategy have to be very successful indeed to have justification at all. The great tragedy is that the strategy has been singularly unsuccessful. first Consumer prices rose by more in 1976-77 than they did a year earlier, and the Budget Papers tell us that there will be no improvement this financial year. Indeed, recent developments have 13 shown inflation to have been accelerating in the half of 1977. For example, the impUcit deflator for non-farm product at annual rates rose from 8.9 per cent in the second half of 1976 to when 13.1 per cent in thefirsthalf of 1977. This Government's poUcies towards the States show attimesscant regard for the States' abihty into raise their own charges and hence exacerbate pressures. If this happens, any gains central Government may hope to make by public spending, and hence aggregate demand, wtil be immediately offset by price rises to increased State charges. In many instances the States have been forced either to cut services an or to increase charges. We mentioned this in the months amendment which I have had the honour to 12 move tonight and which wtil be seconded shortly per by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the the honourable member for Reid ( Mr Uren). In cases where services-for example, t reasonably be cut, price rises increasing the real are mandatory. The recent Victorian Budget contains examples of the results of this Federal Govern the ment's austerity. Last March the Victorian Government approved budgets for hospitals the State. In its Budget of 7 September the Victorian Government was forced to cut these already approved plans by 5 per cent. The Premier, Mr Hamer, placed responsibiUty for this the action squarely at the feet of the Federal Government, his own political colleagues. The few Melbourne Age has reported him as saying that the Federal Government had unilaterally cut its share of the costs of community health centres and the school dental program and that the State had without warning been forced to carry a greater share of the burden than it had pregovernment viously. It is worth noting in passing that such unilateral acdon is hardly the hallmark of a government that is interested in real corowing operation between alltiersof government. Of is course, that is only the window dressing-the words. When it comes to actions that is not example of real co-operation between the central Government and the States. It now appears that all Victorian hospitals be forced to impose staff ceilings and to place ban on new beds and services. It is to be hoped that the inefficiencies that staff ceilings have caused in the Commonwealth Public Service will not emerge in Victorian hospitals. The conseBill quences there could be far more that over the last two days we have seen the results of staff ceilings outlined in the General's report, which indicates that ridiculous staff ceilings have led to terrible inefficiencies in Austrahan Government programs and in the administration of the Australian Government. This could be repeated, and probably will repeated, by this Government forcing the States to penny-pinch here and there. In some cases States. that will be apphed to hospitals As well as announcing a curtailment of services, Victoria's recent Budget foreshadowed stiff costs. increases in rail, tram and bus fares. These will inevitably cause a rise in general price levels.",92

It would be unrealistic to assume that with their funds cut in real terms two years runcause ning the other States will not be forced higher indirect tax charges. It is appropriate at this time, with Federal Ministers flying numerous kites about interest Order! rate trends, to draw attention to the large increases in the borrowing programs of State authorities. The non-Loan Council following warn programs of the States are toriseby cent in real terms for larger authorities and by over 20 per cent in real terms for smaller authorigrams ties. This compares with a 6 per cent real drop borrowing under the Loan Council umbrella. munity. State Loan Council programs are effectively underwritten by the Commonwealth, being part of its Budget. State, semi-government and local authorities, of course, have to pay higher interest rates on their funds. This means that the larger the proportion of total State bordown through the authorities the greater the cost to the State as a whole. By forcing the States to do more of their borrowing outside the an Loan Council program, this Bill increases the States' borrowing costs. The Federal deficit looks better, but the States have to pay the price. will Unfortunately, my time is almost at an end. I a should hke to summarise my points. This cut in pubhc spending will cause enormous problems for the States. There is no area in which we need public spending more than in capital works.

The area improvement program, which assisted his area in particular, has been completely eroded and the growth centre program not expenditure has been drastically reduced. The result has been a marked increase in the do States' responsibihty, with no increase in capital only funds being provided to meet that increased re11 sponsibihty. The States and local authorities wtil receive only 37.4 per cent of the total Budget outlay for 1977-78. In the last Labor Budget, that of 1975-76, the States received 38.7 per cent of the total Budget outlay. That means that their share has fallen by about 1.25 percentage points over a period of two years. That is a significant decrease and one which puts the new federalism into its proper perspective. The States and local authorities are receiving substantially less under the present Government than they did under the Labor Government. On the other hand, the share has increased. That has is been the end result of Fraser's new federalism. The Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) has achieved the reverse of his avowed policy. He has cut the total level of pubhc sector spending, Table 1 while at the sametimehe has redistributed funds from State and local government back to the Commonwealth. 1977-78 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 If we look at the broader implications of the Loan Council programs we see a similar result. 3,722.6 4,341.3 The Government, time after time, has taken 1,263.1 short term economic policy decisions without looking at the long term consequences. The Loan 4,919.3 5,604.4 Council allocation to the State governments is (15.7) (13.9) yet another example of lack of foresight in drawing up economic pohcy. More than half of pubhc 2,409.4 2,880.8 spending on non-residential building and construction is funded through the Commonwealth 1,481.4 Budget. Total capital outlays were cut by 7 per cent in this year's Budget, despite an increase of 4,006.2 4,362.2 5.7 per cent in Loan Council allocations to the (-2.4). (8.9) States. Even when the allocations made under 8,925.5 9,966.6 the gentlemen's agreement are taken into account, capital funds under Commonwealth 15.2 14.4 control increased by only 5 per cent. That represents a decline in real terms of between 6 8,940.7 9,981.0 per cent and 7 per cent, because we must take (5.6) (11.6) into consideration that the inflation rate this year 9.5 9.2 is 11 per cent to 12 per cent. This cutback in funds for building and construcuon comes at a dme when the very grave circumstances indeed. Over the past 18 months the labour force of the building and construcuon industry has dropped by 4 per cent. In the same period the total labour force has increased by some 2 per cent. There are signs of modest recovery in the private sector, but that will be absorbed by the drop in spending conof trolled by the Commonwealth. This will push industry into deeper recession. More people in the industry will lose their jobs, and unemployrepayments ment will increase. Such a decline in the capacity of the industry must limit the chances for dium term recovery. Unless it is countered there will be serious botdenecks and cost pressures which will impair prospects for sustained recovery and control of inflauon. It is in that context that the level of funding forment the State Loan Council programs assessed. It emerges from an analysis of theabout 30 per centagreement. figures that the funds for capital works to the States from the Commonwealth have the fallen in real terms by 4.8 per cent when pared with those made available under last set year's Budget; and they have fallen in real terms by 13 per cent when compared with those made available under the last Labor Budget, that of 1975-76.

Last year we saw the shifting forward of hospital payments and the movement Telecom Australia capital funds outside the the Budget allocations as a cosmetic approach in order to reduce the Budget deficit. In this Budget of loans by the Australian Wool Corporation have been deferred. As well, as that, methe growth in Loan Council payments has been curtailed. The reduction in growth in those outlays in this Budget has been partly offset by increased growth in allocations under the gentlemen's agreement.

253,Mr UREN,"I thank the House. The interest rate on borrowings under the gentlemen's agreeinterest ment is approximately 11 per cent. By comparithan son, capital funds provided through the Budget have a large grant component. That means that the effective interest rate on capital funds is more than 7 per cent, and that is about the averto age situation. In plain terms, the Government is coercing the States out of a lower interest sphere into a higher interest rate sphere. Becausemcreased of that shift in the source offunds, the States a substantial increase in interest payments year and in the years ahead. Those payments be about $20m more in 1977-78 than they wouldforcing have been if the money had been allocated was in the last Labor Budget. Tbis is another effect on the States of Fraser's new federaUsm. has forced the States to move into a higher interest bracket in that they have to meet their program commitments other than by Budget alauthorities. locations. This, of course, is another gimmick, may use that term, under Fraser's new federalfor ism. It means that the States have to meet subI stantially increased interest payments. That money has to be raised by means of mcreased at taxes and charges for services. I might that is a further burden on the ordinary people. In turn it can have the effect only of increasing inflation and of imposing further burdens people who depend on the services provided State and local governments. The sewerage program which the Government scrapped is a prime example of that. Let us have a look at that situation. When we inherited the sewerage program in 1972 we found that 50 per cent of the people in Perth Uved in unsewered ney. homes; and one in every seven people in both Sydney and Melbourne Uved in unsewered man homes. In an effort to overcome the backlog providing sewerage to these homes, we entered into an agreement under which we tried to carry out that program. It was a program which would cost an enormous amount of money. In the three years that we were in government we made doUar. avaUable something Uke $200m to try to catch up on the sewerage backlog. In the last year the Labor Government alone we made avaUable Phillip $ 113m. What were the terms on which we made that money avaUable? Of that money, 30 per cent was made avaUable as an interest free nonat repayable grant and the other 70 per cent was made avaUable at the long term bond repayable over a period of about 40 years. What is the situation now? The situation is the State governments and the semi-government authorities will have to go on to the loan market and will have to pay increased interest rates. Semi-government authorities have to pay an rate 0.5 per cent to 0.75 per cent higher the long term Commonwealth bond rate. The best repayment terms they can get are 15 to 20 years and in some cases shorter term. What no does that mean? It means that the taxpayers have pay higher water rates. The increased costs pass not only to the individual but also to busirate ness. Business, hi turn, passes them on in prices again creating further inflation. faceThis Government by its new gimmickry of forcthis ing semi-government authorities and State will governments outside the Budget parameters is up interest rates at atimewhen it says as it that it wants to reduce interest rates. It Let us examine the debt burden of the sewerage authorities. In 1972 an enormous debt burden was being carried by the semi-government In Sydney the Metropolitan Water, ifi Sewerage and Drainage Board was paying 52c every dollar it coUected. Mr Deputy Speaker, think it would be fair, when the Minister for Special Trade Negotiations ( Mr Howard) talks the table for about 15 minutes of my speech, if say that something were said from the Chair.",96
254,Mr HOWARD ,"What is the matter, Tom? Can on you not hang on to your audience?",96
255,Mr UREN,"The Mmister Uves in a very exclusive suburb. He Uves in an affluent area. He is a wealthy young man. He thinks only of wealth. He does not think of anybody. He does not think about the under-privileged people in the western, southern or south-western suburbs of SydHe really represents the privileged class. It is that class which Fraserism breeds. He is a young who thinks he is going places. This is part of in Fraser's new federalism. As I was saying, the debt burden on the metropolitan sewerage authorities in Sydney in 1972 was 52c for every dollar they collected. In Newcastle it was 53c in every dollar. In Perth it was about 53c in every In Melbourne it was 58c in every dollar. Yet in Melbourne the whole catchment area is in of such a situation that it has been poUuting Port Bay for many years. This is the great sadness about the sewerage backlog. If this sewerage backlog is to be cleared now it will be done a much higher cost to the people. It wtil be inflationary and a burden on the great majority rate and of the Australian people. It is extremely ironic that the Government has thatmade a commitment to cutting the deficit to control inflation. It has done this in a cosmetic way by changing the capital funding arrangements and increasing interest payments. These increased payments have to be passed on and the inflation rate therefore increases.",96
256,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Mr Lucock)- tect the Order! If the Minister for Special Trade detriment. Negotiations wants to carry on a conversation changing with the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr done in arelativities Connolly) he should at least shift to the front taken no account bench. The voices carry across to the microphone and it is not fair to the main spokesman for the Opposition.,97
257,Mr HOWARD ,I apologise to the Chair and the honourable member for Reid.,97
258,Mr UREN,"If we look more closely at thehave relative share of capital funds in each State we find other disturbing trends. Since the Labor Budget of 1975-76, specific purpose capital payments have fallen by 33.5 per cent in real terms. Loan Council payments have fallen by 11.5 per cent. Funds under the gentlemen's agreement have increased by 20.5 per cent. Some States are more dependent upon a particular source ofexpired. capital funds than are others. As a consequence, the relative share of total capital funds the States has changed. For example, the less wealthy States of South Austraha and Tasmania depend more on Loan Council funds than onreserve gentlemen's agreement funds. I have set out amendment table which shows how the smaller States have been disadvantaged. I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard.",97

But it has worked to their Those which wtil really benefit are the more wealthy States. The whole process of between the States has been very random and ad hoc way.

It has taken no account of the urgent needs for particular works programs within individual States. to Needs related programs such as the sewerage area improvement program and growth centres either been aboUshed or cut back severely. No offsetting adjustments have been made to eneral purpose and capital funds. It is on this as is that I believe the amendment is a constructive one.

261,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has,97
262,Mr SAINSBURY ,"Eden-Monaro) (9.37)- I think it was extremely bad form for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Uren) not to his right to speak as the seconder of the a as most people in this House with reasonable principles would do. It would probably have been of great benefit to the people of Australia who are listening if he had just seconded the amendment and incorporated his speech in Hansard. Nevertheless, I must retaliate on one or two things of a general nature that have been mentioned by the two previous speakers. Even though they refused to speak on Table 4 this Bill which, as somebody said, is a machinery BUl they have been engaging in the normal STATES Labor Party diatribe of half-truths. The honourable member for Adelaide ( Mr Hurford) actually said that the economy is in worse shape than 1975-76 1977-78 when the Labor Party went out of office. If he cares to look at some of thefigures-not half32.88 33.49 truths-suc h as gross domestic product, inflation 26.32 26.47 16.36 16.10 rates, company profits and real disposable 10.31 9.92 incomes in this country since Labor went out of 8.99 9.15 office he will see that even though the struggle is 5.06 4.87 very difficult it is being won. It is being made 100.0 100.0 increasingly difficult by the bitter people on the other side of the House. One or two of the things which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said tonight sounded rather sick to me. I fear that some of the bitterLarger ness which seems to pervade the Opposition benches is getting them away from the true problems of Austraha. The honourable member talked about unemployment as though the Opever cared about unemployment. It is aU very well for him to come into this House at stage and talk about great unemployment in this country. We know we have great unemployment in this country. We know it is a tremendous lem wbich all AustraUans must face. But what [ >osidve means has the Opposition put up in ast 18 months to overcome this problem. I could certainly mention a few negative means. It derided the Government when it asked the Conreal cUiation and Arbitation Commission to keep has down wage increases. Opposition members who do not relate to the working man in this country anymore should talk to some of the working people. The honourable member for Burke ( Mr Keith Johnson) is laughing. He takes pride in the slighdy fact that he used to be a truck driver. There are plenty of truck drivers in my electorate and increase plenty of truck drivers all over Australia. They increase are working men. They are people who worry spend about how much their wives and children are grams in going to have. The man who is laughing does not probably speak really care about them. The last two honourable members who spoke in this debate apparently think , that aU this tremendous increase in pubhc expenditure about which they speak so regularly m this place, going to fall out of the sky. Who wtil pay for extra pubUc expenditure? Will it be the Governfunds; ment that wtil pay? No, it wtil not be the ment; it wtil be the taxpayer. The taxpayer wtil have to pay and he wtil have much less money to funds spend if he has to pay higher taxes. The Lord ment to find knows that there are enough people on the other per side who have said recently that we must raise Roads Act, and in such taxes so that we can cover some of this pubUc expenditure. The honourable member for Queensland Government project'. I do'Another Adelaide, who I beUeve is some sort of economic why he has to do that. I do not know why spokesman for the other side, often says that must raise taxes. The sorts of things that we on this side of the House are doing are designed to. Wales bring taxes down. The evidence of that isrightin the Budget this year and on 1 February next yearing the people of Australia wtil recognise this when we they receive their pay packets. Let me return to this machinery Bill which repeat, in its basic terms, of BUls that have through since 1970 when a Government of the same colour as the present Government decided that it would assist the States to some extent putting through what normaUy would have beenjust loan funds without interest payments from the States. That was a reasonably generous sort of offer and in terms of the amount of money being offered in this BUl-$477m-it wtil save the rural States, even at present interest rates of 10 cent or more, around $50m per annum. That has been going on since 1970 and it is the sort this thing that one would expect from a Government or our colour. Half truths have been coming out of the mouths of the two previous speakers who probhave been talking about no increase in funding to the States this year. They seem to be following the the myth that the New South Wales Premier has been putting around in the newspapers recently. Fancy saying that there has been no increase in funds to the States this year! AU anybody to do is to look at the figures. It is quite easy. We are talking about a total this year of some $5,775m in total funds to the States, and that includes loan funds which admittedly have been funds, trimmed. It also includes general revenue and that is a substantial increase. It is an of 13.8 per cent on last year. That is greater than the rate of mflation. It means that the State governments have more to real terms on some of their own prothan they had last year. Some people will after me about the Government's federalism pohcy and ask whether some of the things that we do for the States are worthwhile, because all we seem to get from some of the Premiers is criticism in face of the fact that is they are receiving more funds from the Federal the Government. I repeat that they are not our they are taxpayers funds. We have to raise Governthem from somebody out ofhis pay packet. It is most disturbing to read that some of the their way from the Federal GoverncentthefundingStates, for projects where there is 100 as under the National Queensland the Premier puts increased up signs along the road saying not know he has we to waste money on any signs. The New South rural Government receives money from us for local roads but it wants to reduce its matchfunds so that the overall rural local roads funding this year may not mcrease by as much as would hope. We had the same battle last year and it looks as though it is on again this year. I is a just wonder what the New South Wales Governgone ment thinks about federal funding. I wonder what the New South Wales Government thinks about funding in general especiaUy in country by areas when examples such as that which I have mentioned keep coming up. I have been getting sUghtly off the track. Talking about roads and federal funding to the States, the New South Wales Government took a long time to put in its local roads aUocation priorities this year. per Why did it take that Government 6 weeks longer on the allocations than it took for urban local of roads, the beloved urban local roads on which the New South Wales Labor Government places such high priority? The rural local roads obviously do not matter very much. . In educauon we find that these large block funds that we are talking about tonight have been increased in general, but who gets knocked on the head over education funding when we reduce a certain amount of money for government schools this year? We do. We have reduced, by the guidelines to the Schools Commission, some $14m out of a total of $571m to government schools this year in order to assist non-government schools, which after all save the State government a great deal by their very existence. Mr Abel-And the taxpayer.",97
263,Mr SAINSBURY,"And the taxpayer, as the honourable member for Evans says. They save the taxpayer a certain amount of money but because we have decided that non-government schools will receive a small amount less we come in for all the cross-fire. People forget that in this Bill we are debating tonight and in our general pohcy the States are receiving from us an increasing amount of money in real terms. One wonders whether it is worth the effort. One wonders whether we should not give the States a greatly increased amount and say. 'We will get out of education. We will get out of roads.' I just wish that the State governments in their criticism would be a little more fair. I turn now to preschools, another area that has been mentioned a lot lately. We have not increased our funding for pre-schools this year but we received criticism and it is alleged that in New South Wales we have reduced funds for pre-schools.",99
264,Mr LES MCMAHON ,You have.,99
265,Mr SAINSBURY,"That is certainly a he. It is an absolute lie. We have not reduced any funds for pre-schools. Why do the State governments not get stuck into the education system and look after the pre-school children, as they were bound to do for many years previously? Why are we criticised? We are increasing our overall funds to the States by a large amount in relative terms and we are still coming in for criticism. I conclude now because a number of other people want to speak, and that has been made difficult enough by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Reid. I would just like to reiterate to the people of Austraha that this Bill confirms the fact even more that the present Government is one of decentralism. We want the people to keep as much money as possible. We want the States to have as much money as possible. That is why we brought in the tax changes in the Budget. But the money that we have to raise-w e do not want to have to raise more money than we need, and that is our policyshould be spent as close to the people as possible. That is why we are helping the States as much as possible in the face of unjustifiable criticism that we seem to be receiving from those States.",99
266,Mr WENTWORTH ,"Mackellar ) (9.48)-Very rightly we give to the States freedom to decide how they spend the money they receive from the Commonwealth Government. But that does not mean that we should have no concern where national interests are involved, From the past one can look at some of the ways in which these national interests have been treated. I think particularly of one matter that concerns the New South Wales Government, that is, its decision to abandon the central motorway systems of Sydney and to sell the land which has been purchased with the help of past Commonwealth funds. The Australian Labor Party plan is to dice the motorways and bring permanent strangulation to Sydney's city traffic. The New South Wales Government is going to stop the western motorway from the centre of Sydney to Concord; stop the southern motorway from the centre of Sydney to Alexandria, stop the north-west motorway at some dead end in Glebe and, as for the Warringah expressway, abandon it at Willoughby. This will mean, for example, permanent strangulation for the new port at Botany and for the airport traffic. The sale of the land is an act of vandalism, and the decision to re-zone is simply one of the decisions that is meant to hit motorists throughout Sydney. The Labor Party has the old-fashioned idea that nobody owns a motorcar unless he is a silver tail. Most people who own motorcars are not silver tails .at all. Most people are now fortunate enough to own a motorcar. I say these things because they relate particularly to the local government elections which are to be held in Sydney on Saturday. Some Labor candidates are standing for office at those elections. Those Labor candidates are bound by party decisions even though they may maintain the contrary. They may sincerely think that they can talk in favour of the traffic plans for Sydney. However, they are bound by the Labor decision to destroy permanently the Sydney city traffic and bring permanent strangulation to the city of Sydney. Every Labor Party candidate at the local government elections on Saturday is bound to support this plan. He may say otherwise in his election speech or he may think otherwise but he will very soon find he is not aUowed to think otherwise. Whether he means what he says or not, every one of them will be a fifth column didate for his own area. I am thinking particularly of the elections for strangulation the city of Sydney. It would be tragic if that cil were to fall under the control of Labor men who are endeavouring to strangle city traffic. I speak also of the elections for the Manly- Labor Warringah area which is my own area. I know that there will be Labor candidates in the tion for this area which is to be held on Saturday. I ask that every one of those Labor candidates should be placed lastMr Keith Johnson- I rise to order. I thought that we were debating the States Grants (Capital Assistance) Bill and not some municipal paign committee meeting. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to bring the honourable member to order and ask him to speak to the Bill before the House.",99
267,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Mr Lucock)-I accept the fact that the Bill we are discussing concerned with assistance so far as roads and other matters are concerned. But I would suggest to the honourable member for Mackellar that should not devote the whole of his speech to election which is not the concern of this House nor of the Bill before the House.,100
268,Mr WENTWORTH,"No , sir. But it is of conin cern to this House in that this House has an interest in seeing that Sydney city traffic is permanently strangled. That is a matter of national concern. It is the proper concern of this House.",100
269,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! I would remind the honourable member that the subject matter of local government elections is not concern of this House so far as this legislation concerned. I again suggest that the honourable member should not continue to place his emphahave sis upon local government elections or upon value or otherwise of candidates standing for those elections or their policies.,100
270,Mr WENTWORTH,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I ' House am referring to the decision of the State Labor Government to use moneys which have been going provided under this legislation to The State Government has now decided to sell that land. I regard this as an abuse of the moneys also that have been provided by this Parhament. I regard this as completely germane to the legispayers lation that is before us at the moment. I do not want to put too much emphasis on local government elections. But I do say that Labor candidates are concerned with the conus tinuance and the further perpetration of this cancrime against Sydney. In my area in particular every Labor candidate is dedicated to the of traffic between ManlycounheWaningah and the city. Every car owner when alderremembercasts his vote on Saturday might well that and vote solidly against the candidates.",100
271,Mr KEITH JOHNSON ,"Burke) (9.55)- I elecsupport the amendment moved by the honourable member for Adelaide ( Mr Hurford). I wtil try to be relevant to the Bill before the House. Indeed, no local government elections will be held in Victoria next Saturday. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) talked about the strangulation of Sydney by cars or camsomething. He seemed to think that here was some virtue in everyone owning his own motor car. I sincerely hope that motorcar owners do not choose precisely the same time to take their cars onto the roads. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro is ( Mr Sainsbury) who spoke to this Bill seemed to think that it is some sort of a crime, that somehow or other it is immoral or amoral or whatever he for governments to raise taxation. The honouran able gentleman who has been in this place for a short time-and after reading what was said by Malcolm Mackerras he will be here for less time the future than he has been in the past-ha s not yet learned what the art of government is all not about. I think the honourable member used the words: 'We want people to keep as much money as possible'. I think he meant to say 'as much of their money as possible'. If we follow that argument through I guess we are right back to the time when we did not have government and were in an anarchical situation in which only the those who had strength had power. Even with is the intervention of government in this country that proposition is very much true. Those who money and strength have the power and the those who have neither of these things are obliged to do the bidding of those who do. What the honourable member is trying to tell the is that there is some sort of virtue in this Government saying to people: 'Look we are not to tax you; we will almost leave you withpurchase land. out any taxation at all'. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro made the point that in the end the user pays. He did not use those words. He said that the taxpay, that governments have not funds. That is true. Everyone knows that. There are no the simpletons in Australia. We do not need the honourable member for Eden-Monaro to treat as if we were a bunch of simpletons. We all know that governments do not own money trees. We know that money does not grow in the courtof yards of this Parliament House. We all know this because we all are taxpayers, and those who sit in this chamber are fairly heavy taxpayers. The incomes earned by the people who Uve in my what electorate are not as substantial as my own. But they pay taxes and they know who is paying for things. But what they understand more than does the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is that sees fit. those who earn the most ought to pay the most. They know that, I know that and those honourThere able members on the other side of the House, they were quite sincere, if they were to stand front of their shaving ntirror tomorrow and not ashamed to look themselves in the face, would agree with what I am saying. There is no other way in which to raise revenue. We aU know that. We all know that no private citizen in Australia wtil ever buUd a teaching hospital such as the Royal Melbourne Hospital. We know that doctors wtil build their private hospitals they will treat selected patients and the Uke. all know that the hospital that wtil reaUy provide a service to the community wtil not be built by individual because it is too expensive to do so. is too costly and it is not profitable. Under the private enterprise system in which those who sit opposite to ourtilustriousparty beUeve, only those things that are profitable are owned by individuals, companies and the Uke. Private enterprise does not own anything that is not fitable. Ittikesto hive off these undertakings to government to run. But then it says: 'Look, government cannot run these things. It does not run them profitably. Therefore private must be better than government enterprise because our enterprises are profitable and the Government's enterprises are not'.

274,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,"If the honourable through member for Swan is going to talk about his menment tor, I am not interested. The Bill states: There is payable to a State specified in Column Schedule, during the year ending on 30 June 1978, for purpose of financial assistance in connection with expenditure of a capital nature, the amount specified in the Schedule opposite to the name of that State, any amounts paid to that State under section 4 of the States Grants (Capital Assistance) Act (No. 2) 1976. Further on it says that the States may spend this . money as they seefit.That is fair enough. That is the Bill is aU about. The total sum involved under this Bill is $477,933,000. My State of Victoria is to receive the sum of $120,071,000. That is to go to the State and is to be used as the State is in Victoria at the moment quite a if controversy about three areas of land which are in being examined by a royal commission. They were were purchased with funds which were made available to the Liberal Government in Victoria by the Government in Canberra on the basis that they could be used for whatever purposes the State Government sawfitto use them. I wiU tell the House the purpose for which that Government sawfitto use them. It thought that the fob pockets of real estate developers was afitplace m which to deposit that money. The honourable where member for Eden-Monaro ( Mr Sainsbury) told We us that people should be able to decide how they are to spend their money. I might have been peran suaded to agree with him, except for the fact that It this money was plundered out of this place by a corrupt, inept government in Victoria, a Liberal Government, and then stuffed into the pockets of land developers. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro mentioned a truck driver. I am the truck driver he mentioned, and I am not proashamed of it. I would have been the best truck driver in Victoria. I drove trucks for 20 years and never had a conviction. Perhaps I was the luckiest truck driver in Victoria. I have before me enterprise an article which states: Land owners in the Geelong region stand to make millions dollars under legislation introduced by the State the legisladon, the Geelong Regional Commission the profits from any rezoning of land for development by the commission must be paid to existing land owners. Land owners whose land the commission wants to buy would receive profits of several thousand dollars an acre-o r several dollars per 1,000 acres-o n top of the existing their land. beThat is what is happening to the money that is being sent to the Government of Victoria by the Government in Canberra-mone y taken from the taxpayers around Australia and then paid out this grants BUl to the Victorian Governso that it can do that sort of thing with it. That is only the start; it is not the end of it.

Taking up that point, how can any honourable member in this House assure me that it is so? The funds are made available to the State Government and it can do what it wishes with them. That is acknowledged in the Bill. These are things that have occurred in the past. I am speaking in support of an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill.

Mr Jull-The honourable member was a good truck driver.",102
293,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,"I was the best in Victoria. I can understand the sensitivity of the members of the Liberal Party who are sitting this chamber. They know of the corruption ofthethat Victorian Government, they know of the corruppandering tion of their own Government and they know of the bankruptcy that exists. I refer now to an area that was touched on the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Uren). We are talking about funds for the States. mentioned the discontinuation of the sewerage program. I notice that the honourable member for Diamond Valley is smiling. I think there more unsewered houses in his electorate than almost any other electorate. I do not know how he dares to go home and face his electorate tell the people there that there are no funds avail-made able this year for sewerage programs. I received a letter from the Commissioner of the city of Keilor, Mr Kevin Holland. He wrote to me as he is the sole representative in that area who has been appointed by the Liberal Government in Victoria. He has the sole responsibihty for aging that very large municipality. He rates complained to me in the most bitter terms that there will be no Avstralian Government funds coming to that municipahty to enable the Board of Works to extend the sewerage program, so the people who Uve in that municipaUty wtil not have the opportunity to press a button instead of having somebody come round to the back door in the middle of the night. It is true that there is a large area of Melbourne still unsewered. It is true that there is a large numbergreat of septic tanks. It is also true that Port Phillip is probably the largest septic tank in the We have adopted this so-called new federalbers ism, this chicanery offered to the people of Australia, but not believed by them. I might add, under which die Australian Government will make some funds available to the poor old Statestheir who wtil have to pick up the tab. Nobody ever explained to me why this is so or how the States can raise their funds equitably. It is ous to every thinking Australian who sit on the other side of this chamber most equitable way in which to raise finance through the Australian Government which can It reach into the people's pockets depending on the depth of them rather than charge people left, right and centre. I make no apology for any taxes that the Labor Government levied on people. I was in local government for 11 years before com-one ing to this place and never stood on a cheap platform. I have never gone out to pretend to people about what I am offering or to treat to untruths. I would not do it in a Federal tion either. in Anybody who goes out to the people and says he will give them a cheap tax program is to the top wage earners but certainly not to the middle class because they are not better off now. I wtil give honourable members opposite a poUtical lesson, but certainly not you, Mr by Deputy Speaker, because I do not wish to be offensive to the Chair, it being apoUtical. If He honourable members opposite tell the middle class people that they wtil reduce their taxes, the people will laugh at them and walk away beare cause that is the class of people who demand in more of government than any other class in this country. They know better than the honourable and member for Eden-Monaro ( Mr Sainsbury) who an erudite exposition to this House tonight that the taxpayer pays. I would never teU people that I would reduce taxes. What I would say is that they wtil get fair value for their taxes which wtil be raised according to their capacity to pay rather than by way of State taxes because State mantaxes are most inequitable-as inequitable as raised by local government which are just a flat property tax across the board. I notice the honourable member for Diamond Valley nodding his head again. I hope that he is not going to and sleep but is agreeing with me. Mr Brown-You would have to increase taxes, would you not?",102
294,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,"Not necessarily. The Government at the moment is making a virtue of reducing taxes but to reduce taxes Baymeans to reduce services. The very people with world. whom the honourable member for Canbena ( Mr Haslem) and the 55 other honourable memwho will go with him at the next election are trying to curry favour in their last ditch bid to hold office, those people they trust will come forward to support them when they tell them that taxes will be reduced, will not beUeve the has honourable members because the people know that if they want services they are going to have obvito be paid for and the people know who will be including those paying for them. that the I support the amendment moved by the is honourable member for Adelaide ( Mr Hurford). is obvious that if this Bill is passed, and I suppose by some intuitive process that it will be, it will reduce the funds available to the States in real terms and increase the States' borrowing costs. Surely the cost of servicing debts must be of the greatest worries of State governments ratesand instrumentaUties. It forces the States to the reduce the services they provide and/or to themimpose additional taxes and charges. It leads elecalso to increased unemployment. The Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) now realises his mistake because the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) had to tell him yesterday that he has been making a virtue of cutting back on staff. He is trying to impress this virtue upon the State governments but those governments which have intelligent Premiers-Ne w South Wales, South Austraha and Tasmania-will not wear it.",103
295,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Mr Jarman)Order! The honourable member's dme has expired.,104
296,Mr CORBETT ,"Maranoa) (10.15)-We have just listened to the honourable member for Burke ( Mr Keith Johnson) who seemed to wander a bit. He also seemed very concerned about the situation in Victoria and asked us to prove that money was provided under the Bill. I think the boot should have been on the other foot. If he is complaining about money not being provided under the Bill he should prove that that is the case. This Bill is part of the package of finance for the States distributed by the Commonwealth Government. One cannot but be critical of the incessant clamouring of State governments and State politicians about the limitation of funds to the States by the Federal Government. These unjust and ill-founded utterances should be put to rest once and for all. There is far too much complaint from the States about the funds they get from the Commonwealth. Under this Bill, which owes its existence to arrangements formulated by Liberal-National Country Party governments in years gone by, the States will receive an injection of some $477.933m as a straight out grant. There is ho interest payable on it. There is no repayment and there is JO control. The States have complete autonomy in regard to what they do with this money. It is part of the total Loan Council gram of $ 1,433.8m for the year 1977-78. The States will receive under tax sharing lation announced in the Budget $4,336.lm, increase of $62lm or 16.8 per cent on the preincrease vious year. Yet the Opposition in its amendment claims that in real terms this is reducing the funds available to the States. How can that properly claimed under the circumstances? When one This takes into account Loan Council programs and other special grants to the States, total general purpose grants to the States are estimated to increase by $685.lm in 1977-78. This again is contradiction of the amendment moved by the Opposition. All State governments therefore should be able to bring down Budgets which will provide maximum services without any increase in State taxation either direct or indirect. In the States get a very good deal from the Commonwealth Government although they do not always acknowledge it. They do not have any excuse if their objectives cannot be achieved in a reasonabletime.No State government needs to be comprised of financial wizards to make its budget balance in view of the generosity of the Commonwealth Government-and that should be emphasised- a generosity which has to be maintained under very difficult financial circumstances. Under this Bill every possible consideration has been extended to the States. It allocates money without an interest component. The grant component was introduced because of a realisation by the Commonwealth Government that some State government responsibilities do not attract any income and it is reasonable that the States should get money free of interest to service those responsibilities. In this regard we can mention the money spent on education, on the provision of schools and police stations. They are what might be termed essential needs in a modern era. Interest is charged on other Loan Council programs by virtue of the fact that money expended by State governments on such things as power houses and dams does attract a financial return. An examination of Budget Paper No. 6 for the years 1976-77 and 1977-78 reveals some other interesting facts. In 1976-77 the securities on issue on account of the States per head of population at 30 June 1976 were as follow: In New South Wales $770.64; in Victoria $766.18; in Queensland $762.74; in South Australia $1,117.15; in Western Australia $952.95; and in Tasmania $1,837, giving an average debt of $848.94. The annual interest liablitity per head, State proby State, was: New South Wales, $54.58; Victoria, $54.40; Queensland, $52.80; South Australia, $80.09; Western Austraha, $68.05; legisand Tasmania $130.90. That means an average an interest of $60.14 per head. There was an in 1977 both in the amounts and in the interest. For example, the average interest went up from $60.14 to $65.53, showing that a lot of be money is being invested in Government bonds. is partly due to the fact that this money is made available to the States. Notwithstanding the fact that the Commonwealth gives money to the States free of interest as a grant, under the conditions which I have just enumerated, it is disturbing to note that people in all States have this increasing amount of funds going into bonds and, consequently, an increasing debt through the Commonwealth to Australian bond holders. fact I hope to see an expansion of investment in enterprises which will provide employment and generally increase the welfare of the community as a whole. Similarly, in Budget Paper No. 6, Table No. 8, wefindthat total securides on issue per head of population, as far as the Commonwealth Government's debt to Austrahan bond holders is concerned, shows an increase from $647.50 per head as at 30 June 1976 to $795.65 per head as at 30 June 1977. The point I am making is the need for the Government to try to make conditions available which will attract that money into other avenues of investment. Unless we of the free enterprise parties do something to reverse this trend of investment in bonds, we are failing in the trust which has been placed in us by those who owe their allegiance to our political philosophy. Quite obviously the Government has to create an environment which wtil maximise the opportunities for people to invest in private enterprise with the hope of reward and not allow their funds to be used to a significant degree in the manner in which I have just been talking about, that is, to be used by the Government again for other developments. It is much better for the commumty at large to have this money flowing through private enterprise investment. We have to create an environment where porters people will take risks in creating job opportunigovernment-interes ties by allowing them a reasonable chance of reward for effort expended and risks undertaken. This is something which the Opposition will never concede. Honourable members opposite say that if there is a falling off in expenditure and labour in the private enterprise section, they will make that up with Government enterprise. That under has been a great failure. It was a tragic failure in high interest the years when Labor was in office. We as a traUans the opportunity Government have a responsibility to accept the homes and to purchase some challenge to carefully examine ways of improving productivity and, consequently, competiUfe tiveness. State governments must also be madedous aware of this. There should be general cothat operation in this area. I want to be critical of a words growing feeling in many areas of Australia of a Whitlam point of view which calls upon the Government infectiousGovernment to provide all types of services. when it was in government encouraged too much interest rates.correspondingly dependence on the Government. That is somedid reduce interest thing we should try to overcome. It is not easy, time is appropriate for but we should make the attempt. My political philosophy leads mefirmlyto the point of view that what we want is more initiative, more tralians paying their own way and less governments ment interference in the basic responsibilities the individual. There should be less union interSome ference and fewer trivial and unjustified strikes. Governments should be providing only the foundation for development for the Australian people. The people should supply the basic framework and butid on that under a free enterprise system. This Bill goes part of the way in decreasing the amount of interest paid by State governments. Again, this is contrary to the amendment moved by the Opposition. One of the thrusts of the Budget, of course, is to reduce interest rates. A deficit of reasonable proportions, such as this year's deficit, is the catalyst which wtil allow interest rates to decrease. This is something which the Austrahan Labor Party Government never recognised and does not seem to recognise now. Australia has been pricing itself out of world markets. Interest has been a contributing factor to this. The statistical bulletin put out by the Reserve Bank of Australia in June 1976 shows that the interest rate in June 1973 was 7.75 per cent for trading bank overdraft and that increased to 9.5 per cent in June 1974 and to 11.5 per cent in June 1975, the last year of the Whitlam regime. It is interesting to note that in February 1976, a few months after the FraserAnthony Government was returned to office with an overwhelming majority of support from the Australian people-that showed Labor supwhat the people thought of their type of t rates were reduced to 10.5 a per cent per annum. Quite obviously this is intolerably high. It has mitigated against people being able to compete in international markets.",104
297,Mr BRYANT ,When are you going to reduce it?,105
298,Mr CORBETT,"The rate was 11.5 per cent your Government; do not forget that. This rate has denied many young Austo purchase their own of the comforts of which aUow people to absorb the tremenpressures exerted by modern living; and is what this Government aims to do. Actions speak louder than words. We take action. We get from the other side, but no action. The quite obviously had an enthusiasm for huge deficits in the The Opposition Budget with regular increases in The Fraser-Anthony Government rates and I beUeve that the further reductions. This Bill is positive proof that relationships beAustween the State and the Commonwealth governshould be a partnership. A partnership of automatically denotes a share of responsibUity. of the States appear to me to look upon a partnership as something which allows them to have a vice Uke grip on the right to have troUed spending, and absolute this Government without having to act responsibly because they get money lected by this Government. For too long too many of them have been telling the loud and long about aU they would do if only they could get more money from the Federal Government. I ask honourable members to bear in mind that the Federal Government has reduced the deficit from $4.5 bUUon to $2.2 billion in an endeavour to get economy back on to a reasonably sound basis. Under a BUl which has been introduced into honourable the Parhament-the Income Tax (Arrangements 10.30 p.m. with the States) BUl 1977-al l the States have the right to raise their own taxes but they wiU this because it is not poUticaUy advantageous do so. It is about time they gave up blaming Commonwealth Government for being unable to accede to the insatible demands of their electo tors. For too long they have avoided telhng the people that increased services can be provided on. only through increased taxation. They have avoided telhng the people that. should be telling the people. It is not good enough to blame the Commonwealth. As partners they must also share the responsibUity. I plore the atutudes of some of the State ments in their approach to this are not a federalist government but I suggest to some of the States that, if they want to be partners in a truly co-operative federal system, they also have a responsibUity to Uve within their Budgets and to prune their expenditure so our greatest problem-mflation-ca n be controlled. We must bring back into the Australian poUtical community some blunt, straight forward honesty in assessing what can and what be done. The Federal Government has indicated to States in this Bill that it realises the many ing problems the States have. State governments are a lot better off than they were last year. is a contradiction to the amendment moved the Opposition because the States have received increased amounts. The Commonwealth, neverwhich the less, has contained its spending. It has set an country? example and it will continue to do that. When we go to the people again the false hopes sition supporters have that they might win some of the seats on this side at which viously will be dissipated. I have very much pleasure in supporting the BUl and opposing this amendment which is in every aspect quite the posite to what the BUl proposes. uncon Mr Crean- I wish to move that the debate be right to criticise now adjourned.

308,Mr CREAN ,Melbourne Ports) (10.31)-It would be much more pleasant if we knew what was happening. My understanding was that the debate would be interrupted at 10.30 p.m.,107
309,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,It is a matter for real the Government whether the House continues.,107
310,Mr CREAN,"I accept that. I draw the attendrop tion of the House to the Budget Paper entitled 'Payments to or for the States and Local Governto ment Authorities 1977-78'. At page 6 details of funds to the States for capital purposes are prothere vided. They are divided into two groupstions general purpose capital funds, of which this Bill is part, and specific purpose payments for capital purposes. A total for die two groups is given. For 1976-77, as against 1975-76, there was a decline of 3.6 per cent. For 1977-78 it is estimated that there will be a decline of one per cent when pared with thefigurefor the previous year, which had been a decline also. It means that in real terms the sums being granted to the States for capital funds are less this year. They were less previous year. These are in money terms only. When one takes into account inflation and the like, in real terms capital expenditure is less this year, and it was less last year. also to page 10 of the Budget Paper entitled 'National Income and Expenditure 1976-77'. At current prices, grossfixedcapital expenditure all public authorities rose by 9 per cent in 1976-77 but fell by 2 per cent at constant prices. Surely at atimewhen we have a substantial number of unemployed affecting the economy no one can justify capital expenditure being less real terms than previously. I sometimes wonder at the rather curious economic theories Grants propagated about solving the unemployment problem. Surely at the moment one means increasing employment would be to put into capital expenditure expenditure in the same real at least as previously. I do not beheve that all those who are currendy unemployed can sudbe absorbed in pubhc works programs. I this is one of the great difficulties with unnot employment at the moment. It has been said on We this side of the House by quite a number of speakers that one of the difficulties is matching the demands that are still in the community for labour resources against the skills or lack of skills the that are currently available. The White Paper on National Income and Expenditure gives a number of interesting statistics about capital expenditure. I refer to table 18 on page 22 entitled Gross Fixed Capital Expenditure on New Assets, by Purpose. It shows that Federal authorities in 1976-77, as against 1975-76, which I have mentioned, were spending, in real terms, less than the amounts spent in the previous Budget. There was less spent on education in real terms. There was less spent on health, social security and welfare in terms. There was a very substantial drop in transport facilities. There was a very substantial in the item called 'All other'. Surely at the moment nobody can suggest that if we are able match people out of work with facilities that we lack, it is inflationary. Can anybody suggest if are shortages of nursing homes, police staand pre-school facilities and people are out of work that somehow it is violating some sound economic canon by putting to work the people who are out of work to do the sorts of jobs which wtil provide the facilities that are lacking? This is the reality in Australia at the moment. There is comno doubt, and the aggregate statistics in the document entitled 'Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities' show that in real terms capital expenditure at all levels of the government in Australia, whether Federal, State or local, is less this year than the previous year. Yet the Government, for some reason, expects us to commend it this year for what it says are very I draw attention substantial sums. Surely we all understand now that if inflation is at a minimum nearly 10 per cent-the Governby ment has not brought the rate of inflation below 10 per cent; it was horrified when it was above 10 per cent during the term of the Labor Government but it has done nothing to bring it below 10 per cent-w e can no longer simply take nominal in sums and regard them as indicative of performance. In his second reading speech on the States (Capital Assistance) Bill, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs ( Mr Viner) representing the of Treasurer ( Mr Lynch) at the time said: The purpose of this Bill is to authorise the payment of capital grants to the States in 1977-78 totalling $477,933,000. This amount represents the grant component of the Loan CouncU program for State governments in 1977-78, and is one-third of the total program of $l,433.8m . . . That $l,433.8m means a percentage increase in 1976-77 of 5.7 per cent when there was an came increase in prices in that period of nearly 13 per cent. Surely that would mean a decline, in real terms, in what we are able to do with that sum money. When it is obvious that the private sector of the economy is not prepared to take slack which exists, surely there is an obligation on the pubhc sector to do so. One way by which the pubhc sector could increase real in the community is for it to be provided with greater sums of money. I suppose we get back to the awful obsession with this thing called 'the deficit'-the difference between the total expenditure has to meet and the resources it has available meet that expenditure. The Government calls the difference 'the deficit'. This year the Government sees great virtue in the fact that the deficit is billion instead of $2.7 billion. honourable member on the other side of the House to stand up and argue that the performance of the economy would be worse if we were to spend another $500m in the in lieu of performance by the private didly, I do not think any honourable members opposite could do that. Mr Groom-Inflatio n would be higher.",107
311,Mr CREAN,Why would inflation be higher? Mr Groom-Of course it would be higher.,108
312,Mr CREAN,"The honourable gentleman states that inflation would be higher. I should like to hear the profundity of his explanation. Why would putting people into work assets which the commumty needs be any more inflationary than paying the unemployment benefit from pubhc revenues, which at ment is costing $800m? I do not know what the honourable gentleman who interjected holds and I do not know whether he will be returned the next general election. He ought to go his electorate and say to the unemployed people there that he does not think that putting work would be a good thing and that what they are doing is helping to abate inflation. Does the honourable gentleman seriously maintain that? At the moment this Government is paying out of the tax collected from those who are working sum of $800m in unemployment benefit to people who are not working. In most cases the Government is paying near enough to one-half or two-thirds of a wage to people nothing. Would it not be more sensible and, I suggest, no more inflationary to pay them a full wage to do something that would be socially useful? I know that the honourable gendeman who interjected has not been here for very long. He here in the euphoria of the last election, as part of the greatest majority ever to be elected in the history of this country. But he can hardly beof lieve that the economy is any better because of the things which he claims his Government has up the changed. Is inflation any less? Mr Groom-Yes , it is less.",108

314,Mr CREAN,"Is unemployment any less? Mr Groom-You put 100,000 people out of the Government work in one year.",108
315,Mr CREAN,"The honourable gentleman has been very frank in giving an answer about inflation. I simply ask mm: Is unemployment in the $2.2 electorate he represents any less than it was 2 I should like some years ago? Mr Groom-Yes , than it was in January 1976.",108

321,Mr CREAN,I am sure that the honourable member for Braddon will be out of his seat in a short while. He will be out of his seat if he is prepared to go back to the electorate he represents and say that the total unemployment in that electorate is less than it was when he came into the a seat.

If we look at the assisttheance being provided to the States in the table on anpage 8 of the Treasury document 'Payments to 5 or for the States and Local Government Authorities' wefindthat the aUocation of general purpose funds to States, large State authorities and State authorities has increased by 17.8 per cent.

They recognise the increased pacity of State governments. Opposition memunanimously bers say that this proposal has forced the Statesaccess to reduce the services they provide. How could it? During the last 12 months the States have increased their public servants by 20,000. Mr Groom-Fou r per cent.",110

The honourable memgive ber for Adelaide ( Mr Hurford), in his ment, claims to represent the views of the Opposition and understand these matters. Why do honourable members opposite not assess what local governments and State governments are doing? Why do they not look at their accounts, and look at what they are really achieving and what they are delivering? How can it be that withiers an increased staff of 20,000 pubhc servants sertheir vices are decreasing? One would perhaps tend totax. think that the New South Wales Government it might be decreasing its services when one looksa at the pubhc transport system in that State. It a massive deficit of $300m. This is after the Labor Party went to the people claiming, in that one of its priorities as a government be to improve the public transport services that State. It has not done so. The dangerous ditions, with derailments still apply. We have further statements that the Bill will lead to increased unemployment. This Bill is not related to matters of unemployment. The wished honourable member for Melbourne Ports, mencould tioned some programs. I take it he was referring to programs something like the RED scheme. Heposals. must recognise the huge expense involved in thatStates program by paying full salaries and making all it. those arrangements. In fact the honourable member's own Party eventually rejected that It was an incredibly imaginative program but an incredibly incompetent one. It did achieve the objectives. The Labor Party rejected it and all AustraUansrejectedit. They the concept; they rejected the practice. What we need is not greater assistance m the form of loan moneys to State governments but an expanding opportunity and a control of an expanding opportunity for business such as this Government has been able to proand also a restriction of the continual wage with which we have been pressed in the enState governments have consistently expressed the view that over a long period the arrangements which they previously worked under were caunsatisfactory. In fact in 1970, the six States proposed that they be given direct to income tax broadly along the lines of the scheme that operated then in Canada. In 1975 they proposed again unanimously that the general revenue grants arrangements should be based on the principle that the States should be compensated for their lack of access to income tax. This principle has been recognised by the present Government. In fact as part of its federwayaUsm program it has given and wtil continue to the States the opportunity to take up taxamendation on behalf of their people. What is happening at the moment? Through the State Premiers there is a de facto taxing power given to the States. They have a share of taxation which they set. They have a share of at33.6 per cent. By common agreement the Premof Australia have agreed to tax the people of States at that level on their personal income What they need to do, of course, is to admit and come out and say: 'Yes, we have agreed to tax level of 33.6 per cent on the people of our hasStates, and we will take up the capacity to extend the level at which we wtil tax or reduce the level fact,at which we wtil tax'. It would seem to be would sensible that from now on this Government in ought to show on tax forms and literature the con-levels of tax which the Premiers of each State have agreed to accept and to aUow the people of Australia to see the mcreased capacity of State governments to carry out works programs if they to take them up. This mcreased capacity be reflected in works programs if the people of particular States understood such proOne has only to look at the record of aU to see their increased capacity in education and transport, the additional loans they will redrive ceive this year, the capacity of local government and the road programs that have been ced. The recommendations should be brought forward strongly to indicate to the Austrahan people that tax sharing capacity under federalI ism is something that is beneficial and that will allow a regionalisation of Federal Government pohcies. It is a possibility that State governments can apply more specifically, economic programs that it is not possible to apply from Canberra, except if one adopts the socialist control of every aspect of human life, of State governments and of local government",110

333,Mr LES MCMAHON,"I do not know his age. know that he is in the twilight of his Ufe in the Liberal Party. Why I am upset is that he is interfering with the electorate of Sydney. There are three expressways-the north-western, the western and the south expressway that is going through Botany. The honourable member said: 'Knock aU the houses down. Cars before people'. Tonight he said that the State Government was squandering the funds. On Saturday there wtil be an election in the municipaUty of Warringah. The honourable member said that the Liberal would give its preferences to the indepenrather than to the Labor Party. These proof ceedings are still being broadcast. I hope that people are still listening.

I have been sandwiched between friend the honourable member for Sydney ( Mr Les MCMahon) and that great supporter of uranium ntining and export, the honourable late member for Hughes ( Mr Les Johnson), who I understand is to follow me in this debate. As secretary of the Government Members Federal sitting on $45mAffairs Committee I support this legislation because it represents yet another step forward in the introduction of the pohcy of new federaUsm to Australia. The stronger we can make our eral system the less Ukely is the chance that wtil ever again see this country inflicted with tralist, sociahst, repubUcan government such as we saw during the three years of the Whitlam Whether the Labor Party likes it or not, the plain fact about this legislation is that it apto propriates the sum of $80m to the States, being honourportion of a total of $5,775 bilUonbeen a member Mr Abel-How much?",112
342,Mr HODGMAN,"$5.775 biltion which this year Canberra is making available to the States Australia. That represents an increase of 13.6 per cent on last year. So any honourable memdoes ber, such as the honourable member for I am Adelaide ( Mr Hurford) and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports ( Mr Crean), who claims that there has been no real increase at aU in the funding of the States is talking through his hat. The increase is 13.6 per cent, considerably above the primary rate of mflation, which at the present moment is 9.2 per cent compared with a disastrous, horrendous 16 per cent when Labor I was thrown out of office by the people of Australia on 13 December 1975. This Bill authorises the payment of capital grants to the States in 1977-78 totalling $477m. It also provides for an additional amount, an almade location of $238m, representing the first 6 months payment of capital grants for 1978-79. What does that mean to a small State Uke TasIt means that under this BUl alone the of $50m is to be injected into the coffers of of our State, a State which has never had it so good I since the federalist poUcies of the present Government commenced to be implemented, a State which has done so well that our Labor Premier, who also happens to be the Treasurer of State, for the last two Budgets has not been the able to spend all the money he got from Canme berra. He has not been able to spend it! The tosame man comes to Canberra and cries poverty, yet he is sitting on a goldmine in Hobart. There on. can be no greater compliment to our federaUsm than that the Premiers cannot spend the money that the States are receiving as a result of that federaUsm pohcy. Take the situation of the my Premier of New South Wales, earUer today referred to as Nifty Nev, and since his visit to Japan he has been referred to as Nippy Nev. As as one month before the end of the financial year Mr Wran was in a situation where he had $45m unspent in his loan fund. What is he doing Mr Abel-Whingeing .",112
343,Mr HODGMAN,"And whingeing, as the fedhonourable member for Evans points out, when we his State of New South Wales has the highest uncen-employment in the Commonwealth? Why is he not prepared to spend that money to alleviate the hardship of the employment situation which his parUamentary coUeagues in the Labor Party this House are complaining about? People on this side of the House are complaining about it too, and we got the secret a few moments ago. has put aside this money so that when he wants to cm an election early next year he will be ablethe to bring it out and say: 'Look what I have got!' At the moment he is endeavouring to deceive people of New South Wales and the people of Australia by pretending that he has not got enough money. Look at the situation in Tasmania. In a small State Uke Tasmania, which has unemployment problems, although fortunately they have been aUeviated to large extent as a result of the poUthings cies of this Government, we have the situation that in the last month of thefinancialyear the Premier found suddenly that he had to spend $41m out of his loan funds to avoid being pubreal Ucly exposed as having more money in the kitty than he had told the pubUc he had. The reason simply is that the new federaUsm poUcy has put more money into the pockets of the State Premunable iers than anything since Federation. Some them have the gall to cry poverty when they come here, yet they sit on goldmines in thenStates while men and women walk the streets out of work. We have the situation that the Housing Department, the Department responsible for welfare housing in our State, had to spend $4m in the last month of thefinancialyear. The story is that it did not get through that. We are told another $lm stacked away here and there. are told that the real Budget surplus was $8m and not $1.5m which Mr Netison pubUcly proclaimed. Mr Netison went further and added msult to injury by claiming that the Commoning wealth had short changed him by $6.7m. Mr Netison has a great capacity for saying 'I have been short changed', and then when the monwealth asks him to put up an argument to the Grants Commission to get some more money he backs off very quickly. Three months ago said that Tasmania had been short changed by $4m. He had not done his arithmetic. The sad 13.6 per cent. fact is that since Mr Neilson has been Premier of Tasmania there has actuaUy been one period bis term in office when the population of our State declined. I cannot blame Mr Neilson the decline in the population of Tasmania, but the fact is that it did happen. In the quarter of 1976, under a Labor population of Tasmania actuaUy declined. We said to Mr Netison: 'If you claim that you have not had a fair deal, why do you not go to in the Grants Commission?' The Grants Commission was the brainchild of a Tasmanian, Professor Lyndhurst Giblin. It was created by a TasHe manian Prime Minister, Joseph Aloysius Lyons. It was put there for the benefit of Tasmania and other small States. It is the protector of the smaU States. It is an institution to which the the States can go if they claim injustice. This hypocritical Premier, the most ungrateful Premier in Austraha, claims that he has been shortchanged, but when chaUenged to go to the Grants Commission and ask for the money to be made up he does not answer the challenge. The fact is that the Grants Commission, through the facilities of the Commonwealth Auditor General's Office, would discover the sorts of I have mentioned; that is, that Mr Netison sat on $41m while unemployment was causing human misery in our State, that Mr Netison's departments did not spend their money and that his Budget surplus was $8m, and not $ 1.5m. He and his two Labor colleagues, Mr Wran and the temporary Premier of South Australia, Mr Dunstan, are all sitting on Budget surpluses and are to spend the money they are getting as a of result of this Government's federaUsm poUcy. In the few moments remaining to me I would Uke to comment briefly on some of the contributions made in this debate tonight. The honourable member for Adelaide is a friendly man for whom I have a personal regard, but he made one of the poorest speeches that I have heard in this ofHouse on this subject. Then, to our amazement, We when hefinishedhis speech the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Uren) came in and gave almost word for word the same speech. It was Uke an echo. Sitting here, I had the strange feelthat I had heard it before. The voices were different and the faces were different, but the words were the same. The Opposition moved an Comamendment which is the greatest fraud and charade brought into this House for many years. It claims that this BUl reduces in real terms the he funds avaUable to the States. That is a Ue. It increases the funds avaUable to the States by",112
344,Mr SPEAKER,Order! The honourable gentleman wtil not characterise the amendment for as a Ue. He wtil withdraw that remark.,113
345,Mr HODGMAN,"It is not true. Is that government, the sufficient, Sir?",113
346,Mr SPEAKER,The honourable gentleman wtil not receive advice from me. I have caUed upon him to withdraw the remark.,113
347,Mr HODGMAN,Thank you.,113
348,Mr SPEAKER,The honourable member will withdraw the remark.,114
349,Mr HODGMAN,"I withdraw the remark. ter The claim that the Bill reduces in real terms the cent funds available to the States is untrue, because $187,000, the Bill increases them by 13.6 per cent. Seccent. So when ondly, the amendment claims that the Bill will increase the States' borrowing costs. That too is untrue. What it does is relieve the States of debt people charges which they otherwise would have had to people pay. Thirdly, the amendment claims that the Bill colleagues at anconsider will force the States to reduce the services they provide-that is untrue because the States have more money, so why should they have to reduce the services?-and/o r wtil force them to impose additional taxes and charges. That is demonfundamentally strably untrue because both the Victorian and Tasmanian governments in their Budgets Labor reduced taxes; they did not increase them. but not least-this is the most shabby claim aU-the amendment asserts that the Bill wtil lead to increased unemployment This is part of the Australian Labor Party's disgraceful tactic of using the unemployed as a poUtical footbaU in 1977, just as it did from 1972 to 1975. The amendment is worthless. It is deceitful. It is not worth the paper upon which it is typed.",114
350,Mr SPEAKER,"Order! The honourable to member wtil withdraw the word he used in relation to the amendment. I have today than itTasmania already warned him about using that sort of language, and he wtil cease using it",114
351,Mr HODGMAN,"If you please, Mr Speaker; I withdraw the word. The amendment is unworthy of an opposition which claims to genuinely concerned about the unemployed, cause it uses the unemployed as a poUtical footblind baU. That is not the sort of thing I expect from the Opposition. FinaUy, I wish to take up some points which were raised by the honourable member for Burke ( Mr Keith Johnson). He said that in relagratulate tion to this type of legislation we had to see way in which the money was used. He referred land purchases and went on at some length cannot about a number of land purchases in Victoria. is fair to say that, where the State has come underwe atack over the way in which it carries out its purchases, we are entitled at least to query the acquisition by a State instrumentaUty of a propis erty comprising 326 acres at Craigieburn toria for $908,750 on 30 August 1974, when later the same day the Commonwealth Government paid the sum of $ 1,485,000 for it.

In conclusion, I beUeve that it is absolutely and wrong for the Labor Party to continue to misrepresent, and in particular for State Premiers to continue to misrepresent, this Last Government's federaUsm poticy. We have seen of the deceit-no t in this chamber but outside-of the claim of double taxation. It is a Ue which bedevtiled people in the elections in New South Wales and, to some extent, bedevtiled the elections in the Northern Territory. The plain fact of the matter is that the States have never had it so just good and the smaUer States have never had it so good. I am proud, as a member from Tasmania, say that one thing to which we can point, one 'deceitful' that able, is that of achievement this Government which is irrefuthas been is better off financiaUy since Federation.

355,Mr LES JOHNSON,"And with integrity, which is the kind of advocacy I would expect from the honourable member for Adelaide. present Overall, funds for the States have by 9 per cent which is a reduction of about cent in real terms. Even these figures, however, are dubious. Last year, actual expenditure on specific purpose grants was $l25m less than thesuch figure figure announced in the Budget. Although the Minster general purpose revenue funds have been in relation tofor mcreased, funds for specific purposes have beenhold a 2 per education, cent cut by 8 per cent in real terms and funds for capifulfilled. tal purposes have been reduced by 12 per cent inis real terms.

I do not think there is anyper cent in real terms. Urban pubUcaretranspon dispute about that. If there is a decline of 12 per cent for these purposes there is bound to be a del-spending eterious effect of the type about talked. We are discussing funds which are made able by the Federal Government to the States. That is not a pohtical contention; it happens be a factual contention. As I will show, it is kind of belief which is totally shared by the Premiers. After suffering reductions for two years, the States must soon be forced to increaseSouth taxes and charges orMr Groom-What about services?",114
356,Mr LES JOHNSON,I was just going to mention services. I am saying that in the situation where States suffer reductions over two years they have the option of increasing taxes and charges orMr Groom-Why could they not spend the money?,115
357,Mr LES JOHNSON,"The honourable member for Braddon has asked a question. I am giv-The ing the answer. The Government has two great options. It can increase taxes and charges or vices will be cut. Both these things are happeningthe in the total State situation. So the federalism icy is likely to collapse. The collapse can come about for the following reasons: Last year States expected to get an extra $90m under the tax sharing arrangements to balance cuts in specific purpose grants. As it turned out the disappeared andfiveStates have to rely on a guarantee to keep with the old formula. As a 20 result the formula for tax sharing has been aban-be doned. There is now a dispute between the Com-eUgible. monwealth and the States over the new formula.the I do not think there is any disputation about that.per Any State Premier wtil teU honourable members of about that disputation which is in progress at time. If that dispute is not resolved, fedbeen increasederaUsm is finished. 2 per The major cuts in specific purpose funds include cuts in real terms for major programs as education and roads. I cannot recall the for roads offhand. It is acknowledged by Education (Senator Carrick) that growtn the undertaking to upfactor has not yet been That being the case, with inflation there a cut in real terms in education. A simUar situprevails in regard to roads. Another area of 18 per on pensioner dweUcent in real terms. roads, Funds for Aboriginal advancement down 16 has been cut by 25 per cent. Funds for which I have $800,000. Fundshave national parks been reduced by $2m to for leisure facUities have been dropped by 60 per cent in real terms. As every avail-honourable member knows, urban programs have virtually disappeared. These, of course, to include funds for sewerage which formerly were the in the vicinity of $100m and land development Stategrowth centres which were formerly over $100m. Of course the States are concerned. In the New Wales ParUament on 17 August an urgency motion was moved in these terms. That this House expresses its concern that the Federal Budget delivered last night: (a) Ensures no reduction in unemployment for another year, (b) Cuts back funding for primary producers; (c) Provides for cuts in real terms in expenditure for traditional federal areas such as welfare housing, hospital and health services, pre-school and child care centres, legal aid, school dental schemes, growth centres, sewerage and other programs; (d) Is not conducive to a return of confidence for the privat sector. Premier, speaking on this matter, expressed concern about the unemployment situation ser-and the phght of primary producers. The fact of matter is that unemployment is getting very pol-serious and the Premiers have passed resolutions expressing their concern at this matter. They prethe dict that unemployment wtil top the 400,000 mark by Christmas this year. The fact is this: The only concession in the Budget to unemployment $90mis a sUght extension of the youth unemployment scheme. Age of eUgibUity is to be increased from to 25 years. But young people wtil sttil have to employed for six months before they become Total expenditure on unemployment in Federal Budget is less than $40m or 0.0004 cent of total government spending. The cost this unemployment scheme is less than the the$60m the Commonwealth wtil save by its sinister proposal to pay unemployment benefits in arrears. There was a Premiers meeting. This is the that point I was making in respect of the contribution over area made by the honourable member for Denison buUding and construction ( Mr Hodgman). He was virtually saying States had been overindulged, that they had in been given more than they could spend ters of that kind. The Premiers met on 5 August ing and issued a statement of three paragraphs. I shall quote it because I think it is relevant to the Australian argument. It reads: The Premiers today met in Melbourne overall economic situadon review, they urged an immediate stimulus to the economy through a balanced series of measures designed to employment, without abandoning the task of getting inflation under control. It is the unanimous view of must be reduced as a tangible contribution towards economic recovery and to assist in restoring confidence public and private sectors. The money market and the public are geared to a tion in rates and the Premiers are firmly of the view there should be an early and significant reduction of the prediction given by the Treasurer at the last Conference that interest rates would be reduced this year. Mr Bourchier-This year is not yet over.",115
358,Mr LES JOHNSON,"The honourable mposition gendeman is interjecting. I do not know whether he disagrees with the sentiments I have just outlined. He may not have been listening very carefully so I remind him that the sentiments are not mine; they are the sentiments of the Prema iers, unanimously subscribed to. Premier Hamer of Victoria is just as enthusiastic about this Premier Wran of New South Wales. Even Premclaims ier Bjelke-PetersenMr Kevin Cairns-They made no effort reduce their interest rates when they had the power.",116
359,Mr SPEAKER,Order! The honourable omy. member for Hughes will resume his seat. I point out to honourable members that speaker in this debate and I think we should him in silence and without interjection.,116
360,Mr LES JOHNSON,"Thank you, Mr have Speaker. I will not labour this point. It is Premiers statement and I think it is very imporespeciaUy tant. The Federal Budget did not contain one indication that interest rates would be reduced that AustraUans would have access to funds get the buUding and construction industry going. To that extent, from the standpoint of all Premment iers, Liberal and Labor aUke, there is a very serious omission in the Government's economic strategy. In other words, the Commonwealth ignored this unanimous caU by the State Premiers for measures to stimulate the economy. For example, look at the manufacturing industry. In the employment feU by another 41,000 past year or by 3.4 per cent, and in the industry employment that the Australia in the past year 12,000 or by 3 per cent. feU by another Australian manufacturand matcapacity utilisation is worsening. On the latest below 80 per cent. According to the latestitfigures, figures which were pubhshed in March was private investment was down 3.7 per cent in real terms on last year'sfigureswhich and discussed the were also issued in March. in Australia. As a result of this There is this argument as to whether it is expand desirable to expand the level of pubUc spending. It so happens that Australia's performance in the Premiers that interest rates this regard is not good by comparison with cornoverall arable countries. For example, in the United 5 in the fates current pubUc expenditure on goods and services is 18.8 per cent; in Canada it is 19.2 per reduccent; in Germany it is 19.7 percent; in the United that Kingdom it is 20.5 per cent and in Sweden it is in the light23.6 per cent. In Australia the level of pubUc Premiers expenditure-the proportion of gross domestic product that goes to things public-is 15.4 per cent. Is not there a good case to put against the I that we should hft expenditure to a evei comparable to that of other countries? It seems to me that there is. Let me just give the House a quick illustration. Several countries have increased expenditure over the last two years. As result, unemployment has decreased. In the United States unemployment has decreased by 3 as per cent and the government of that country that it is because of the stimulus given through the public sector of the economy. In Germany there has been a decrease in unemto ployment of 1 per cent. It is not a massive amount but it is a decrease and it is attributed to this stimulation of the pubhc sector of the econJapan, I think, is in a similar position to Germany. I think there must be a lot of new this is the last thinking here. hear The State Premiers have made other statements which, iftimepermitted, I would quote. I already mentioned some of the matters that the are affected by the Budget provisions and by the provisions affecting money for the States. Let me mention one or two others. As so a previous speaker said, local government is a to topic which members could be tempted to get stuck into tonight because of the local governelections occurring in New South Wales on Saturday. Local government expenditure has been cut by 5 per cent in real terms. We know has about thefiddle.There is an increase in the amount of direct expenditure. We know there has been a very wide range of decreases in respect of indirect expenditure. I do not time to enunciate the details of that. to the housing area, total expenditure-thi tainly a Sute matter-is down 30 per cent in real terms over the last two years. Total housing Budget expenditure this year has been cut by $53m, a Budget fact. The area of pre-schools, State matter, has had a cut in funds of $6m. Commonwealth is paying only 49 per cent of salaries in the pre-school area per cent last year and 75 per cent in the year. The school dental scheme, just another casualty, is down by only $0.8m, but it is down my point. instead of being up. In real terms the cut is much larger than $0.8m. I refer next to Aboriginal health. Fancy Aboriginal health being a victim any situation. It has been cut by $ 1 m. The ter for Aboriginal Affairs ( Mr Viner) will knowledge the truth of what I am saying. We have heard a lot about the sewerage program. It would be inappropriate to say that I do not want to dwell on this matter but the fact is that the Commonwealth spent $259m on sewerage up to 1976-77. Last year it was pruned to $50m. This year it has been abolished altogether. Certainly the States are justifiably concerned about that savage curtailment In this debate I was preceded on this side the House by my colleague, the honourable the member for Sydney ( Mr Les MCMahon). Does he not have justification to talk about the cuts 33.3 per cent in the Glebe program? Does he not have justification to complain about the cuts 60 per cent in the Woolloomooloo program? I come next to youth, sport and recreation. That is down by $3m. Every honourable member must be concerned about that This national parks and the adrninistration expenses of the Heritage Commission. There has been $3m cut in the area of youth, sport recreation.",116
361,Mr SPEAKER,Order! I suggest that the honourable gentleman return to ter of the Bill.,117
362,Mr LES JOHNSON,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have been endeavouring curtailments in areas of expenditure affecting State administrationfinancedby the Federal mending Government. It would seem to me that the matters to which I have referred appropriately fit into that category. In consideration of the lateness of the hour, I will refer That, of course, is the question of the environment That affects almost every major State works program.

366,Mr LES JOHNSON,"Indeed I do, Mr in Speaker, and I have no intention of quibbling Minis-about this matter. From what I have said no achonourable member can have any doubt that the States have been given a raw deal. The State Premiers have expressed their concern. I believe that in the very near future as elections occur at various levels around this country-no t just local government elections but, for example, the South Australian State election-peopl e in the community who are starting to feel the accumulated effect of this Government's ill-advised pohcies will react. The substantial effect is that private expenditure can go any way its wants, but the of casualty has to be the pubhc area. I believe that pubhc will react The chickens will be coming home to roost very very soon. I am glad that of honourable members are being given an opportunity to speak very fully in this debate.

I have been a member of this House for a long while, as has the Government Whip, although he has not been a member for quite as long as I have.

370,Mr BIRNEY ,"Phillip) (11.45)-An incident occurred in Broken Hill this week that almost went unnoticed. It has now been called the Latham affair. It concerns the present Administrator and his stooge, the Town Clerk, as well as Noel Latham, who honourable members will recall is the courageous trade unionist who dared to challenge the might and despotism of the Barrier Industrial Council. After fighting legal battles before the Federal Court of Australia and in jurisdictions of the Supreme Court of New South Wales the matter was finally resolved by way of a settlement. (Quorum formed). As I was saying, the incident concerns the present Adrninistrator and his stooge, the Town Clerk, as well as Noel Latham, who honourable members will recall is the courageous trade unionist who dared to challenge the might and despotism of the Barrier Industrial Council. After fighting legal battles before the Federal Court of Australia and in jurisdictions of the Supreme Court of New South Wales the matter was finally resolved by way of a settlement which effectively restored Latham's membership of the Amalgamated Metal ap- Workers and Shipwrights Union. With the concurrence of the Broken Hill City Council he was reinstated in his job as a leading hand mechanic However, after he reported for work, some 90 individuals walked off the job. Despite a meeting called this week by the Barrier Industrial Council the 90 members present, being respectively members of the Town Employees Union, the Municipal Employees Union and the Building Trades Union, decided to have their own meeting at which a resolution was passed supporting the right of any individual to exercise his discretion as to whether he should work with any particular person. This resolution was obviously a sham and a fraud and was directed at pressurising the Broken Hill City Council once more into dismissing Latham. The Administrator and the Town Clerk usurped the functions of their office and acted contrary to all democratic principles when they carpeted Latham at the Council Chambers and put pressure on him to resign on the basis that if he did so voluntarily the Council would pay him full compensation. Let me tell those men now in case they already do not know that their powers flow only from the provisions of the Local Government Act, which would never countenance their despicable behaviour in their miserable attempts to erode the democraticrightsof this individual. They are the same democratic rights as thousands of AustraUans went away for, fought for and died for. Their actions have horrified me and I am sure will disgust all those who beUeve not only in the rule of law but also in an individual's right to work without harassment and intimidation. I suggest that they both resign.",118

(2) Is so, what are its aims and what forms of research and (Construction) development are being encompassed within the inquiry. Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable Semi-trailers and member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Department is not conducting an inquiry into research and development in Australia. It is, however, conducting a review of Government incentives to companies Forklift trucks to undertake industrial research and development activity, including the provisions of the Industrial Research and Passenger and panel Ford Sales Co. of Development Incentives Act 1976. Since my appointment to the Ministry in November 1976, I have spoken to some hundreds of businessmen and invited them to comment on the Act. Already a large number of companies and industry groups have contributed construcwealth tive views. These views, together with my own thoughts con-favoured cerning possible improvements to the program, are currently mentioned, being examined by officers of the Department. However, as the Act came the first grant payments under its provisions will only be made during the 1977-78 financial year, I consider that it is still too early to fully assess Accordingly, I do not propose that any major amendments will be made to the Act until there has been sufficienttimeto assess fully its effectiveness. The honourable member may be tralian Science and Technology CouncU and the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment are at present undertaking inquiries which encompass Government funding of industrial research and development. The Detoral partment of Productivity is contributing to these inquiries. Government Purchases Overseas Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister single. representing the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 17 August 1977: WUl he bring up to date the information in 28 April 1977 (Hansard, page 1430), on the operations of the Committee of Ministers established to examine cases in which evaluation by government purchasing the basis of best value for money would lead to goods being bought overseas.

(2) Of the persons referred to in part (1), how many are (a) aged (i) under 21 years, (ii) between 22 and 45 years, (Question No. 1225) and (ui) between 46 and 65 years, (b) migrants, (c) male, (d) female, (e) skilled, (0 unskUled, (g) married and (h) (3) What Government schemes have been established or are planned to assist the particular type of unemployment his answer of existing in the inner city of Sydney. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable authorities on member's question is as follows: As I explained in the answers to questions 220, 221 and 627 from the honourable member for Werriwa, statistics of unemployed persons registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) are normally compiled according to individual Employment Office areas. If is not usual for the boundaries of these to coincide with the boundaries of parliamentary electorates and in the majority of cases parts Employment Office of several Employment Office areas would be contained in any one electorate. Conversely, however, some Employment Offices either contain a single than one electorate within their boundaries. It is possible to state roughly the proportion of each CES Leichhardt Office area contained in a particular vide statistics relating to the total number of persons registered as unemployed in each of these Offices. Any apply the relative proportions in an effort to obtain an estimate teristics of the unemployed registrants in that electorate, would be misleading as the distribution of population and unemployment within each CES Office area is unlikely to be uniform. (1) With this caveat in mind, the answer to part (1) of the Employment office honourable member's question is that part of 5 Employment Office areas fall within the boundaries of the Federal elecSydney toral division of Sydney as presently constituted, viz: Sydney, Marrickville . . Marrickville, Surry Hills, Mascot and Leichhardt. The Surry Hills . . respective proportions of the S Employment Office areas inMascot volved are 90per cent of Sydney, 10 per cent of Marrickville, Leichhardt . . SO per cent ofSurry Hills, 40 per cent of Mascot and 10 per cent of Leichhardt. At end-July 1977 the numbers of persons registered as unemployed at each of these Employment Offices were as follows: Employment office Sydney Marrickville . . . . Surry Hills (2) (a) Statistics of persons registered by age are only maintained for persons aged under 21 years and those 21 years of age and over. Within this constraint, the persons listed in part (1) of the answer can be divided as follows: Employment office Sydney Marrickville Surry Hills . .

(3) What has been the response of the People's RepubUc 2,971 690 of China. NA member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) During the visit by the Prime Minister to the People's Republic of China last year, Mr Fraser expressed the concern of the Australian Government about the support given by the People's Republic of China for insurgency movements in South East Asia. The Chinese made statements in reply that their relations with foreign communist parties would not be allowed to impinge on government to government relationships. Research and Development Dr Klugman asked the Minister for National Resources, upon notice, on 23 August 1977: (1) Is his Department at present conducting an inquiry into research and development in Australia. (2) If so, what are its aims development are being encompassed within the inquiry.",121
374,Mr ANTHONY ,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The Depanment of National Resources is currently undertaking a national survey of energy research and development in Australia. The survey of Commonwealth Government departments and instrumentalities has commenced, and State governments, universities and private companies will be approached in due course. It was decided to undertake this survey in recognition of the fact that the formulation of an energy research and development policy which will make the most effective use of the nation's research resources cannot take place without detailed knowledge of the existingresearcheffort Defence Expenditure Mr Hurford asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 25 August 1977: (1) In view of the statements in the Budget Speech and papers that expenditure on defence is to increase by 7.4 per cent in 1977-78 relative to 1976-77, and that this is an increase of one per cent in real deflator for defence expenditure during 1977-78 6.4 per cent (2) Since manpower costs are over half of total defence spending, and average weekly earnings are expected to increase by 10.S per cent, is diture about 2.S per cent. (3) Are certain categories of defence expenditure to be cut, is the number of defence personnel to be reduced, or is the pay of defence personnel expected to increase by less than 10.5 percent. (4) If any of the possibilitiesreferredto (3) are expected, what are the details. Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) No. Calculation of an expected implicit deflator for defence expenditurerequiresan estimate f >rices. The Budget estimate for defence spending is based argely on prices and wages ruling at the time the estimate was made, namely in May 1977, and does not purport to an estimate in 'outturn' prices. There is a bulk allowance included in the Budget estimates for prospective increases in wages and salaries during 1977-78 which includes defence; where appropriate, supplementation will be sought in Additional Estimates for other cost increases. (3) and (4) See answers to Questions (1) and (2). The estimates provide for an increase of one per cent in total defence expenditure inrealterms in 1977-78. Details of the composition of defence expenditure-at May 1977 price and wage levels-are set out in Statement No. 3 attached to the Budget Speech (pages 41-44). Unemployed Persons, Northcote (Question No. 1260) (Question No. 1309) Mr Garrick asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 25 August 1977: (1) What is the percentage of unemployed persons per head of workforcein Northcote, Victoria. and what forms of research and (2) What are the comparable percentages in (a) Heidelberg, (b) Collingwood, (c) Greensborough, (d) Ballarat, (e) Boronia, (0 Camberwell, (g) Mentone and (h) Prahran. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The latest available statistics of the size of the labour force by local government areas are those from the 1971 Census of Population and Housing. These are now out of date and it would be inappropriate to use them to calculate the unemployment percentages sought Figures from the 1976 Census are not yet available. Moreover, with the exception of Ballarat, all the areas mentioned by the honourable member are within the metropolitan area of Melbourne which, for the purposes of the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES), is regarded as a single labour market I can provide the honourable member with the numbers of persons registered as unemployed at the Offices of the CES located in the areas he mentions. However, I should also (Question No. 1295) remind him that CES Offices usually cover an area larger than the boundaries of the local government area in which they are situated.

381,such for Mr VINER ,"The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1H35) It will be recalled that the previous Government in 1975 reduced the total level cation Commissions' programs for 1976. By contrast, this Government adopted levels of expenditure for 1977 which restoredrealgrowth to the education programs. Funds colleges of advanced education by 5 per cent, for TAFE by IVi and schools by 2 per cent In times of major inflationary pressures no government can sustain fixed triennial planning because of the imposcommenting sibility of making large fixed commitments three years ahead. Accordingly, the Fraser Government has introduced the principle of the rolling triennium with indicative planive ning guidelines to enable planning to be made against prospect of increased national capacity. The guidelines for 1978 envisaged indicative planning have r >as or2 per cent for universities, per cent for TAFE. In the light of the need for the maintenance of economic restraints the Government has not been able to provide for 2 per cent growth has, however, essentially consolidated them upon the base growth levels achieved rn 1977 and has provided a 10 per cent increase for TAFE. The Government recognises that the slowing down of growth in universities and colleges of advanced education in 1978 may lead to some re-adjustments. Nevertheless as far as staff are concerned the wages and salaries component recurrent expenditure will receive full cost supplementation. Such costs represent by far the major part of education expenditure. Although capital funds will not be not(3)true supplemented in 1978, tender prices are proving to be far on any visit more stable in recent times. Concerning the Government's position on grants to schools, I refer the honourable member to my statement made in the Senate on 8 September 1977, when I tabled the Schools Commission Report for 1978. Foreign Investment Review Board Mr Hurford asked the Treasurer, upon notice, Government' on 6 September 1977: (1) Did he say in his PressreleaseNo. 69 of 8 April 1976 on the establishment of the Foreign Investment Review Board that the Board would be given a statutory basis at a later date. (2) If so, is the legislation to be introduced during the present parliamentary sittings; if not why not (3) Has he received any advice from (a) the Board or (b) the Treasury on this matter. (4) If so, will hereleasethat advice. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) No; see answer to (4). (3) (a) Yes. (b) Yes. (4) I am not prepared toreleaseparticulars of advice given to me by the Foreign Investment Review Board or the Treasury. Nevertheless, Imay say that I have become aware of certain problems inherent in establishing legislation for the Board. The issues warrant further investigation. As announced in my policy statement of 1 April 1976 the Board has responsibility for advising the Government on the need for and scope of a Foreign Investment Review Act. The Board has this task in hand. Ministerial Visits to the Republic of Korea of expenditure under the edu(Question No. 1480) Mr E. G.

(2) Does he dispute that he is the only coalition Minister to visited South Korea in the last 10 years, as the Prime colleges and schools, and Minister stated on 16 August 1977 (Hansard, page 254). (3) If he does dispute the Prime Minister's statement, to which of his colleagues does he believe that the article in the three sectors. It referred.",134
382,Mr SINCLAIR ,"The answer to the honourable members's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The Prime Minister's reply on page 254 of Hansard, 16 August 1977,referredonly to visits by present coalition of Ministers, one of which took place after publication of the Australian Financial Review article on 10 February 1977.

383,Mr CONNOLLY ,"the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 9 March 1977: (Question No. 1328) (1) How many unions have taken advantage of the s offer to conduct secret ballots for union elections through the Australian Electoral Office. (2) How many unions have chosen to conduct their own ballots. (3) How are ballots, which unions conduct themselves, supervised. (4) What will be the cost to revenue of the elections referred to in pan (1) during 1976-77. (5) What will be the approximate cost of the elections referred to in part (2) during 1976-77. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I understand the honourable member's quesuon as referring to the number of organisations of employees which have applied to have elections officially conducted under section 170 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act since the Government's secret postal ballot legislation came into operation on 9 August 1976. From 9 August 1976 until 29 July 1977, the number was 46. (2) Elections in organisations are normally conducted on a recurrent basisrelatedto the term of the office concerned. As a result it would not be possible to indicate the number of organisadons of employees which have chosen to conduct their own ballots until the full cycle of elections, extending over 3-4 years in most instances, has been completed. (3) Where the rules of an organisation do not provide for secret postal ballots, elections are to be conducted by the Returning Officer appointed under the rules of the organisation and in the manner prescribed in the Secret Postal Ballot Regulations to the Act. Where the rules of the organisation do provide for secret postal ballots, elections are conducted by the Returning Officer appointed under the rules of the organisation and in the manner provided in the rules of the organisation. (4) The estimated cost to revenue of elections referred to in pan (1) was $246,680.08. (5) Informadon on the cost of elections conducted by organisations themselves is not available. Conciliation and Arbitration Act: Rules of Registered Organisations",135
384,Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,"the Minister for organisationthatunderprescribes Employment and Industrial Relauons, upon Arbitration nodce, on 9 March 1977: (1) Does the Conciliation and Arbitration Act or its day Regulations make any provision that requires that the rules tion-that of a registered organisation shall give its members ample prescribed notice of the opening and closing date for nominations for not official positions. (2) If not, is it the practice of the Registrar to refuse to register rules which faU to provide for suitable public notice of the opening and closing dates of nominations, particulars or offices to be filled and ample time within which a candimade date may nominate for office. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable encountered member's question is as follows: (1) Section 133 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act requires that the rules of a registered organisation shall provide for the manner in which persons may become candidesirable, dates for election. Neither the Act nor the regulations specifically require that the rules give members nouce opening and closing date for nominations. However, section 140 of the Act provides that the rules members conditions, obligations or restrictions which, having regard to the objects of the Act and the purposes registration under the Aa, are oppressive, unreasonable unjust. (2) Compliance with the Conciliation and the prescribed conditions set out in the Conciliation and Arbitration Regulations is a precondition toregistrationas an organisation. Regulation 115(i) is to the effect that of the rules of the applicant association'. . . shall be a which, if the association were registered, would contravene sub-section(l) of section 140 of the Aa'. The operation of alterations to certain rules of an ationrequiresthe certification by the Registrar that, in his opinion, the alteration complies with and is not contrary the provisions of the Aa, of theregulationsor of an award and is not otherwise contrary to law. Whether a provision of the rules of an organisation complies with therequirements of section 140 is a matter for the opinion of the Industrial Registrar. Conciliation and Arbitration Regulations: Nominations for Positions in Registered",136
385,Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,"the Minister for There Employment and Industrial Relations, upon requirements nouce, on 9 March 1977: (1) What is thereasonfor the alteration made to subregulations (2) and (3) of Regulation 139 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Regulations. (2) In what way does the newregulationaffea persons belonging to an organisation whose rules stipulate no opening and closing date for nominations, but allows its management committee to summarily fix such dates without nouce or publication. (3) How can the practical application of this Regulation be reconciled with the provision of Regulation 146AD except by keeping nominations open for at least 2 months. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Regulation 139 of the Conciliation and Arbitration (Question No. 97) Regulations, as amended by Statutory Rules 1976 No. 187, a request by an organisation or a branch of an section 170 (1) of the Concilation and Aa for the condua of an election shall be made not less than 2 months or more than 6 months before the last on which persons may become candidates at the elecis, the closing date of nominations. Formerly, the period was a period not less than one month and more than three months before the closing date of nominations. The amendment of regulation 139 was inresponseto difficulties experienced in the operation of the former regulation. I am advised that, in many instances,requestswere not until the period prescribed by regulation 139 (2) had almost expired and that as a consequence the Industrial Registrar and the Chief Australian Electoral Officer at times serious difficulties in the condua of the election, requiring, for example, the postponement of certain steps in the elecuon. I am also advised that experience had shown that it was in order toreducethe likelihood ofrequestsbeing made out of time, to enlarge the time for making requests by of the extending the maximum period during which they may be made from 3 months to 6 months before the closing date of shall not impose upon nominations. Resolution of these difficulties has been effected by of increasing the maximumtimeprescribed for the making of a or request to 6 months before the closing date of nominations and having the time for making requests expire 2 months beand Arbitration Aa fore that date. (2) Under the amended Regulation, the Registrar retains his discretion under regulation 139 (3) to accept a request none made less than 2 months before the dosing date of nomirule nations. The type of situation to which the honourable member has adverted appears to be covered by the existence of this discretion in the Registrar. Furthermore, the Governorganisment has also promulgatedregulations(Statutory Rules 1977 No. 33) which require industrial organisations to notify to by 1 September in each year information as to the dates of nominations for elections due in the forthcoming 12 month period. Theregulationsalso require the publication of this information by the Industrial Registrar. Members of organisations will thus have an opportunity to decide whether to request an election under section 170, and be able to do so well within the prescribedtimelimits. (3) I have already described the effea of regulation 139. Regulation 146AD, which applies to elections conducted under the secret postal ballots regulations, prescribes that the Organisations Returning Officer shall, within 21 days before the opening of (Question No. 98) nominations, publish in a newspaper certain particulars concerning the lodging of nominations. is no conflia between these tworegulations.The ofregulation139 are founded upon the closing date of nominations, those ofregulation146AD upon the opening date of nominations. In practice, in the case of an organisation conducting an election in accordance with the secret postal ballot regulations, and requesting the conduct of that election under section 170 (i), the requirements of the Regulations would apply without conflict. For example, where the rules of an organisation required nominations to remain open for one month, a request under section 170 (i) would, in accordance with regulation 139, be required to be made at least two months before the closing date of nominations and thus would precede the opening date of nominations by one month. That request would precede by one week the notification in accordance with regulation 146AD, that is, 21 days before the opening date of nominations. It is not, therefore, aresultof the combination ofregulations139 and 146AD that nominations must remain open for a period of 2 months, or that they may berequiredto remain open for a longer period than specified by the rules of an organisation. Trade Union Elections Mr Wentworth asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 18 April 1977: (1) What elections have been held in trade unions registered under the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act since 31 December 1975. (2) How many persons were entitled to vote at each of those elections. (3) How many votes wererecordedat each of those elections. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's quesdon is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) The only union elections relates to those of elections that are conducted by the Industrial Registrar or the Australian Electoral Office pursuant to section 170 of the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act. The information sought by the honourable member for the period 9 August 1976 to 29 July 1977 is in the table referred to in the Answer to parliamentary tion No. 437, and which has been placed in the House of Representatives Table Office. Information for the period 1 January 1976 to 8 August 1976 will be forwarded to the distribution honourable member when it is avaUable. Cultural Agreements Mr E. G.

NA,CONVERSION OF OVERSEAS,10
NA,INDEBTEDNESS.,10
Mr SCULLIN , I ask the Prime,10
NA,Minister whether there is any authority,10
NA,for the cable message published in,10
NA,morning's newspaper that the GovernSouth,10
NA,ment does not intend to convert at an,10
NA,early date Australian loans bearing,10
NA,"interest at more than S per cent., other",10
NA,"than tbe New South Wales loan,",10
NA,"£13,000,000 which will fall due on. the",10
NA,1st November?,10
Mr LYONS ,Ther e is n« authority,10
NA,for the published statement. The,10
NA,immediate necessity before the Govern-,10
NA,meut is the conversion of the New South,10
NA,AVales loan which will mature on the,10
NA,"1st November, but the conversion of",10
NA,other overseas indebtedness is under the,10
NA,constant consideration of the Govern-,10
NA,ment. Only by putting our house in,10
NA,order and maintaining our credit abroad,10
NA,can we hope for any improvement in the,10
NA,rate of interest on the overseas debt. We,10
NA,must be ready to convert the balance of,10
NA,the debt when the opportunity offers.,10
NA,INVALID AND OLD-AGE,10
NA,PENSIONS.,10
Mr NAIRN ,Th e Government has,10
NA,intimated that the bill to amend the,10
NA,Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act will,10
NA,"provide for, among other things, making",10
NA,the property of a pensioner subject after,10
NA,his death to a charge for the pension,10
NA,drawn during his lifetime. I ask the,10
NA,Prime Minister whether this provision,10
NA,"will be retrospective, and whether, when",10
NA,"both husband and wife are pensioners,",10
NA,the enforcement of the charge will be sus-,10
NA,pended until after the death of the,10
NA,survivor?,10
Mr LYONS , I hope to introduce the,10
NA,"amending bill at an early date, when full",10
NA,"details will be given to the House. Mean-,",10
NA,while the points raised by the honorable,10
NA,member are receiving consideration.,10
NA,UNEMPLOYMENT LOAN.,10
Dr EARLE PAGE ,I n connexion,10
NA,the loan for unemployment relief,10
NA,"that was raised last year, was provision",10
NA,made for a sinking fund which would,10
NA,amortize the loan in a brief period similar,10
NA,to the provision attaching to the loan for,10
NA,the payment of the wheat bounty?,10
Mr LYONS , I shall get the infor-,10

NA,Government of that State to reduce the,10
NA,rate charged for electric current supplied,10
NA,of to the Federal Capital Territory?,10
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,Th e,10
NA,suggestion will receive consideration.,10
NA,COMMUNISM.,11
Mr LANE , I n view of the legal,11
NA,obstacles to dealing with communist,11
NA,"organizations, will the Attorney-General",11
NA,consider the need f o r declaring all. such,11
NA,bodies throughout Australia unlawful,11
NA,associations?,11
Mr LATHAM , T h e r e is no legal,11
NA,vision by which the Government or the,11
NA,Governor-General may declare an organi-,11
NA,zation to be an unlawful association. The,11
NA,"law does, however, provide for the prose-",11
NA,cution of persons fo r certain activities,11
NA,i n connexion w i t h alleged unlawful asso-,11
NA,"ciations, but evidence must be produced",11
NA,in accordance with the law to satisfy the,11
NA,court that such associations are unlaw-,11
NA,ful. There is a further provision for,11
NA,application to the H i g h Court for a,11
NA,declaration that a particular association,11
NA,"is unlawful, and I shall consider the",11
NA,advisability of utilizing i t .,11
NA,PRICE OF SUGAR,11
Mr BEASLEY , I nsk the Prime M i n -,11
NA,ister whether the published report regard-,11
NA,ing an impending alteration of the Sugar,11
NA,Agreerneut is accurate?,11
Mr LYONS , A t this stage I am un-,11
NA,able to give details of the tentative agree-,11
NA,ment between the Government and various,11
NA,sections of the sugar industry as a result,11
NA,of the recent conference in Canberra.,11
NA,The representatives of the industry have,11
NA,agreed to the proposed reduction i n the,11
NA,"price of sugar, and the matter is now",11
NA,under the consideration of the Queensland,11
NA,Government.,11
Mr FORDE ,Th e agreement was ac-,11
NA,cepted under duress; the Commonwealth,11
NA,had pointed a gun at the sugar interests.,11
Mr LYONS ,Onl y one section said,11
NA,that i t accepted the agreement reluctantly.,11
NA,The others accepted i t without protest.,11
NA,DEVELOPMENT OF NORTH,11
Mr GREGORY , I ask the Prime,11
NA,Minister Whether the Government recog-,11
NA,nizes the menace to Australia constituted,11
NA,"by the empty north, and the absolute",11
NA,f u t i l i t y of inducing settlement there,11
NA,under the conditions imposed by the high,11
NA,"tariff, the Arbitration laws, and the Navi -",11
NA,gation Act? Does the Government in-,11
NA,tend to formulate a policy that will en-,11
NA,courage the introduction of private capital,11
NA,and the peopling of that vast area?,11
Mr LYONS ,Th e report submitted,11
NA,to Cabinet by the Minister fo r the Interior,11
NA,as a result of his observations on a recent,11
NA,"tour of North Australia deals, inter alia,",11
NA,"with land settlement, and will be con-",11

NA,WIRELESS BROADCASTING.,11
NA,LISTENIN G LICENCES FOB BLIND PERSONS.,11
Mr R GREEN ,Severa l months ago,11
NA,I introduced to the Postmaster-General,11
NA,a deputation which asked that listening,11
NA,licences should be granted to blind per-,11
NA,sons free of charge. Since then several,11
NA,"questions on the subject have been asked,",11
NA,and to each the Minister replied tliat the,11
NA,matter was under consideration. When,11
NA,will he announce a decision on this im-,11
NA,portant matter.,11
Mr FENTON , I have again to tell,11
NA,the honorable member that the matter is,11
NA,still under consideration.,11

NA,Minister for Trade and Customs aware,11
NA,of the widespread distress amongst citrus,11
NA,growers as a result of the unprecedently,11
NA,"low prices, frosts, and other adverse cir-",11
NA,cumstances? As this year's crop is es-,11
NA,timated to be ample for local require-,11

NA,MINISTERS ' ATTITUDE TO,11
NA,TARIFF.,11
Mr FORDE , I draw the attention,11
NA,AUSTRALIA. of the Prime Minister to the following,11
NA,"paragraph, which appeared in this morn-",11
NA,ing's Sydney Daily Telegraph:-,11
NA,FENTON AND THE TARIFF.,11
NA,Although the Postinuster-General would not,11
NA,Btate definitely that he would vote against the,11
NA,"tariff, he indicated to-day that he would not",11
NA,"support it. "" I am going to stick to my elec-",11
NA,"tion pledges,"" said Mr Fenton. "" I t is a rule",11
NA,"of my party, and in the Labour party, that",11
NA,"tariff matters are non-party.""",11
NA,Is this the first revolt on the part of,12
NA,Ministers against the disastrous tariff-,12
NA,"slashing policy of the Government, and is",12
NA,it a fact that several Ministers have,12
NA,threatened to resign ?,12
Mr LYONS ,I t is not'a fact that,12
NA,several Ministers have threatened to,12
NA,resign; but it is a fact that the Post-,12
NA,master-General will carry out the pledges,12
NA,that he gave at the elections.,12
Mr FORDE ,I s the Postmaster-,12
NA,General correctly reported in to-day's,12
NA,press as having said that he will not sup-,12
NA,port the Lyons Government tariff reduc-,12
NA,"tions, but will vote against them?",12
Mr LATHAM ,Tha t is not a question,12
NA,dealing with administration.,12
Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. G. H. Mackay).,12
NA,-Order ! I cannot..allow tbe question of,12
NA,the honorable member. He has been in,12
NA,Parliament long enough to know that,12
NA,"Standing Order 92 provides that "" ques-",12
NA,tions may be put to Ministers of the,12
NA,"Crown relating to public affairs.""",12
Mr FORDE , I submit that my ques-,12
NA,tion relates to an urgent matter of public,12
NA,importance.,12
Mr SPEAKER , I cannot allow the,12
NA,honorable gentleman to argue against my,12
NA,ruling.,12
NA,AFFORESTATION.,12
NA,FEDERAL CAPITAL TERRITORY.,12
Mr STACEY ,Wha t area of land is,12
NA,under afforestation in the Federal Capital,12
NA,"Territory, and what amount has been",12
NA,expended on this work to date?,12
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,A s,12
NA,the honorable member was good enough,12
NA,to inform me that he proposed to ask,12
NA,"this question, I am able to inform him",12
NA,"that the area under afforestation is 5,500",12
NA,"acres, and that the cost up to date, includ-",12
NA,"in<r establishment and maintenance, is",12
NA,"£60,266 17s. 3d.",12
NA,TEADE WITH THE EAST.,12
Mr JENNINGS,I n view of the in-,12
NA,creasing interest that is being taken in,12
NA,"tbe trade with the East, and the many",12
NA,"inquiries being made, will the Minister",12
NA,issue from his department to those in-,12
NA,terested information in pamphlet form',12
NA,as to the steps deemed necessary to de-,12
NA,"velop that, trade?",12
Mr FRANCIS , I shall be glad to,12

NA,"Markets, who is temporarily absent on",12
NA,official business.,12
NA,BROADCASTING.,12
NA,STATION IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA: RELAY,12
NA,STATION FOR NORTHERN TABLELANDS.,12
Mr A GREEN ,I u view of the fact,12
NA,that the Trime Minister stated in his,12
NA,recent budget speech that a sum is being,12
NA,set aside for the erection of A class,12
NA,"stations, will he take into consideration",12
NA,"the claim of Western Australia, in which",12
NA,State it was previously arranged that,12
NA,"a station should be erected; but, unfor-",12
NA,"tunately, the contract for the machinery,",12
NA,"which had already been let, was cancelled",12
NA,because of the depression?,12
Mr FENTON , I intimated on Friday,12
NA,last the exact work which had to be car-,12
NA,ried out in. regard to tlie erection of,12
NA,regional broadcasting stations. A l l,12
NA,"States were included, with the exception",12
NA,"of South Australia, which has the most",12
NA,"recent station. That station, incidentally,",12
NA,is one of the best. I understand that,12
NA,many residents of the far-flung electorate,12
NA,represented by the honorable member are,12
NA,"receiving an admirable service, but he can",12
NA,rest assured that Western Australia,12
NA,will receive the consideration due,12
NA,to it.,12
NA,Mr R. GEEEN -Doe s the Govern-,12
NA,ment intend to erect a relay station in,12
NA,the Northern Tablelands during the cur-,12
NA,rent financial year?,12
Mr FENTON ,I f the honorable,12
NA,gentleman had read the replies that I,12
NA,gave to a long list of questions which he,12
NA,"asked me last week, he would not have",12
NA,found i t necessary to ask this question.,12
NA,LEASING OF HOTELS.,12
NA,FEDERAL CAPITAL TERRITORY.,12
Mr DEIN ,Wil l the Minister state,12
NA,"whether, as the result of the calling of",12
NA,"tenders, the hotels Ainslie and Wellington",12
NA,"have been leased; i f not, what use, i f any,",12
NA,does the Government intend to make of,12
NA,them?,12
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,,12
NA,"Some time ago, the Government called for",12
NA,tenders for the leasing of both these,12
NA,hotels. I t received tenders in regard to,12
NA,the Ainsrie Hotel wliich. were fairly,13
NA,"satisfactory, but those relating to the",13
NA,Wellington Hotel were not quite so,13
NA,satisfactory. Some further details have,13
NA,yet to be considered in connexion with the,13
NA,lease of the Ainslie Hotel before a settle-,13
NA,ment can be effected. These details are,13
NA,"under consideration, and it is expected",13
NA,that a decision will shortly be arrived at.,13
NA,No determination has yet been come to,13
NA,.as to the future of the Hotel Wellington.,13
NA,SHEET GLASS.,13
NA,CLOSING DOWN OF FACTORY.,13
Mr R GREEN ,Wit h reference to,13
NA,the statement of the Acting Minister for,13
NA,Trade and Customs that the Australian,13
NA,Window Glass Proprietary Limited in-,13
NA,tends to close down its factory for six,13
NA,"weeks, in order to effect alterations to a",13
NA,"tank, is it not the usual practice in the",13
NA,glass industry to close the works down,13
NA,temporarily because of the burning out,13
NA,of furnaces? Has the Minister any in-,13
NA,formation to the effect that the company,13
NA,intends to close down its factory per-,13
NA,manently?,13
NA,NA,13
NA,I made in this House last week was plain,13
NA,and .deliberate. The company intends to,13
NA,close down its factory for six weeks. I,13
NA,understand that this particular factory,13
NA,hat three furnaces. One has been unthe 12th September:-,13
NA,"satisfactory all the time, and neither of",13
NA,the other two has given the satisfaction via,13
NA,that was anticipated. I t should not be are,13
NA,"necessary to close down the factory,",13
NA,merely hecause of one furnace being out of,13
NA,"order, and the intention is to close down",13
NA,the works for six weeks to enable the ing Monday.,13
NA,necessary reconstruction of the tank,13

Mr WHITE ,I n view of the reducber,13
NA,tions in wages and other expenditure in,13
NA,"the Postal Department, is there any pros-",13
NA,pect of a reduction in telephone and,13
NA,postal charges taking place; or is the,13
NA,statement of the Director of Postal,13
NA,"vices, which appeared in yesterday's",13
NA,"Herald, that no reduction is likely,",13
NA,policy of the Government?,13
Mr FENTON ,A t present we are not,13
NA,anticipating any reduction in telephone,13
NA,charges.,13
NA,DEPORTATION OF COMMUNISTS.,13
Mr MARTENS ,I n yesterday's,13
NA,"Sydney - press appeared a"" statement to",13
NA,the effect that the Minister for the,13
NA,"Interior had said, when addressing the",13
NA,"Constitutional Club, that up to the end",13
NA,of last month 109 Communists had been,13
NA,"deported. Last week, when I asked what",13
NA,number of men had been deported since,13
NA,"the Government took office, I was in-",13
NA,formed that 80 had been deported. I,13
NA,"wish to know, therefore, which is correct,",13
NA,the information contained in the report,13
NA,"of the Sydney press, or that given to me",13
NA,in answer to a question?,13
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,Tb e,13
NA,figures given in answer to the honor-,13
NA,able member's question were correct at,13
NA,"the time, and the figures given to the press",13
NA,last Monday were also correct. The,13

NA,Tliat only mail to or from Hobart is carried,13
NA,tbe West Coast road. Postal facilities,13
NA,"with tlie north of the State, via the new road",13
NA,denied. A letter posted at Launceston,13
NA,on a Sunday does not reach Queenstown until,13
NA,"Wednesday evening, and the quickest reply is",13
NA,not delivered in Launceston until the follow-,13
NA,to Will the Minister ascertain why such,13
NA,postal facilities via the West Coast road,13
NA,"are denied, and will he give consideration",13
NA,to the suggestion that the residents of the,13
NA,northern parts of Tasmania be permitted,13
NA,to enjoy such improved postal facilities?,13
Mr FENTON , I shall make in-,13
NA,"quiries, and furnish the honorable mem-",13
NA,with a reply at an early date.,13
NA,COAL DISPUTE.,13
Mr JAMES ,I s it not a fact that the,13
NA,primary cause of the threatened trouble,13
NA,Serin the coal industry throughout Aus-,13
NA,tralia is the interference of a State tri-,13
NA,the bunal in Victoria which has given an,13
NA,award reducing the wages of the workers,13
NA,"a further 20 per cent, on top of the 12-J",14
NA,"per cent, reduction that was made dur-",14
NA,ing the lockout in 1929 and 1930? Sec-,14
NA,tion 28 of the Industrial Peace Act,14
NA,reads-,14
NA,No award or order of a special tribunal or,14
NA,"local board shall be challenged, appealed",14
NA,"against, reviewed, quashed or called in ques-",14
NA,"tion, or be subject to prohibition, mandamus,",14
NA,or injunction in any court on any account,14
NA,whatever.,14
NA,I n view of the fact that the coal-mining,14
NA,industry is governed by an award of the,14
NA,"Coal Tribunal set up under this act, the",14
NA,provisions of which have been over-,14
NA,"ridden by a State tribunal, does the",14
NA,Attorney-General intend to take 'appro-,14
NA,priate action against the State Govern-,14
NA,"ment ? I f not, will he endeavour to avoid",14
NA,the threatened dispute by calling a com-,14
NA,pulsory conference of the parties con-,14
NA,cerned as provided for in the act?,14
Mr LATHAM ,A s at present ad-,14
NA,"vised, I do not anticipate that there will",14
NA,be any general stoppage in the coal-,14
NA,mining industry of Australia. The,14
NA,award of the Victorian State tribunal,14
NA,"was made, I understand, pursuant to the",14
NA,provisions of an act recently passed by,14
NA,the Victorian Parliament after the,14
NA,federal award applicable to Wonthaggi,14
NA,had been set aside by the Commonwealth,14
NA,Arbitration Court. The act passed by,14
NA,the Victorian Parliament was supported,14
NA,by the honorable member for Wonthaggi,14
NA,in that Parliament. I t has never been,14
NA,"suggested, so far as I am aware, except",14
NA,by the honorable member for Hunter,14
NA,"( Mr James), that any award made",14
NA,under the Industrial Peace Act is,14
NA,in any way inconsistent with the,14
NA,Victorian award. I f there ever were,14
NA,such an award it would almost certainly,14
NA,"have expired, for no award has been made",14
NA,under the Industrial Peace Act since,14
NA,July; 1928. I f there were such an award,14
NA,in force the matter would be one for de-,14
NA,"cision by the appropriate tribunal, and",14
NA,not for a Minister of the Crown.,14
NA,PARLIAMENTARY SESSION.,14
Mr GREGORY ,I n view of the fact,14
NA,that section 6 of the Constitution pro-,14
NA,"vides that there ""shall""-no t ""may""-",14
NA,be a session of Parliament once in,14
NA,year. I should like to know what course,14
NA,Prime Minister intends to take i f the,14
NA,tariff schedules now before Parliament exhibition,14
NA,have not been passed by both Houses of,14
NA,Parliament before the end of the year?,14
Mr LYONS ,Th e desire of the Go-,14
NA,vernment is to end this session before the,14
NA,"year closes. I f that can be done, the diffi-",14
NA,culty contemplated by the honorable,14
NA,member will not arise. I sincerely hope,14
NA,that it will be possible for Parliament to,14
NA,complete all the business befcre i t by the,14
NA,end of the year.,14
NA,INDUSTRIAL ARBITRA -HON.,14
Mr GANDER ,Doe s the Prime,14
NA,Minister believe in the fixation and ob-,14
NA,servance of the basic wage as laid down,14
NA,"by the Federal Arbitration Court ? I f so,",14
NA,will he instruct the Attorney-General to,14
NA,intervene in the application now before,14
NA,the Federal Arbitration Court by the,14
NA,New South Wales Government for the,14
NA,setting aside of the federal basic wage of,14
NA,£3 13s. in the New South Wales railways,14
NA,"and tramways, and the substitution of a",14
NA,wage of £3 10s.?,14
Mr LYONS ,Th e policy of this Go-,14
NA,vernment is not to interfere in any way,14
NA,with the Commonwealth Arbitration,14
NA,Court.,14
Mr JAMES,Seein g that it is the,14
NA,policy of the Government not to inter-,14
NA,"fere with the Arbitration Court, will the",14
NA,Prime Minister operate the same policy,14
NA,in respect of the determinations of the,14
NA,Public Service Arbitrator and prevent,14
NA,the decisions of that gentleman being,14
NA,nullified by the action of honorable mem-,14
NA,bers of another place?,14
Mr LYONS ,Th e honorable member,14
NA,is now referring to a matter which has,14
NA,-,14
NA,been specifically placed within the power,14
NA,of this Parliament. I n taking certain,14
NA,action respecting two determinations by,14
NA,"the Public Service Arbitrator, Parlia-",14

NA,While leaving the Commonwealth Arbi-,14

NA,"THE "" FIVE - YE AR PLAN.""",14
Mr ROSEVEAR ,Ha s the Acting,14
NA,NA,14
NA,"each the film known as "" The Five-Year",14
NA,"the Plan""? Does the honorable gentleman",14
NA,approve of the prohibition of the public,14

NA,that the film was exhibited in Great,15
NA,Britain for a considerable period and was,15
NA,favorably commented on by the press?,15
NA,"Is he prepared to l i f t the ban, and follow",15
NA,the Government's professed policy of,15
NA,following Great Britain?,15
NA,NA,15
NA,referred to by the honorable member and,15
NA,am not prepared to alter the decision that,15
NA,has been given. There can be no question,15
NA,but that the film has been produced for,15
NA,the purpose of Soviet propaganda. I n,15
NA,"that circumstance, it is not in the best-",15
NA,interests of this country that it should ho,15
NA,shown here. A l l I can say about the,15
NA,statement that the film received favorable,15
NA,"comment from the press of Great Britain,",15
NA,"is that i f it were shown here, a section of",15
NA,the Australian press would also comment,15

NA,dulging in a violent attack on the repara-,15

NA,vernment considers that pact to be a con-,15
NA,tribution towards world peace? Can the,15
NA,honorable gentleman therefore reconcile,15
NA,the action of his department in allowing a,15
NA,film destructive of world peace to be ex-,15

NA,"1. Wherever ""six capitals"" are specified in",16

NA,3. W i l l lie reconsider the decision of his,16
NA,department to give only permissive right to,16

NA,(after purchasing i t themselves) and to insist,16
NA,upon the department's right to take over all,16
NA,"Each, the instruments so installed at any later date",16

NA,1 12 3 4. I f at any future time i t should be deemed,16

NA,"ferent type of instrument, w i l l the department",16
NA,agree to a subscriber retaining possession of,16
NA,"the "" Neophone "" after its disconnexion, rather",16
NA,than surrendering i t to the department?,16
NA,5. Is i t a fact that the President of the,17
NA,Electrical Association of New South Wales,17
NA,stated that there are several firms i n Sydney,17
NA,capable of manufacturing the new telephone at,17
NA,"a reasonable price, and that -the only difficulty",17
NA,is in securing an order from the post office,17
NA,large enough to jus tify the initia l installation,17
NA,of the necessary machinery?,17
NA,6. Has his attention been drawn to the fol-,17
NA,lowing statement of the President of the,17
NA,Electrical Association of New South Wales:-,17
NA,""" I t is unfortunate that there should be a large",17
NA,"number of the old telephone receivers i n stock,",17
NA,but if the post office had followed the usual,17
NA,"commercial routine, the major portion of the",17
NA,capital cost of those instruments would have,17
NA,been written off within five-years from their,17
NA,initial installation . . . i t seems scarcely,17
NA,fair for the Post Office Department to put,17
NA,difficulties in the way of its introduction until,17
NA,the old instruments have all been re-,17
NA,"installed""?",17
NA,"7. I f so, what action does he propose taking",17
NA,in regard to the whole question?,17
Mr FENTON ,Th e answers to the,17
NA,honorable member's questions are as fol-,17
NA,low :-,17
NA,"1. The ""Neophone"" is. not available i n the",17
NA,American telephone service. I t is a develop-,17
NA,ment of the British Post Office and Messrs.,17
NA,Siemens Brothers. Its advent does not demon-,17
NA,strate that the Australian telephone service,17
NA,is behind that of other countries.,17
NA,2. The statement could hardly be accepted,17
NA,"as ono of scientific accuracy, but the transmis-",17
NA,sion qualities of the instrument are good and,17
NA,slightly better than the instruments which,17
NA,have hitherto been standard in telephone,17
NA,administrations. I t w i l l be recognized that the,17
NA,telephone instrument is not the only item,17
NA,affecting the transmission of clear speech.,17
NA,The satisfactory transmission of speech over,17
NA,very long distances in Australia compares most,17
NA,favorably with what has been accomplished,17
NA,elsewhere. This high quality of service is,17
NA,regularly being rendered on instruments which,17
NA,"are not of the ""Neophone"" type.",17
NA,3. The department's permission is of a ten-,17
NA,"tative character, and may be withdrawn when-",17
NA,ever that step appears to be desirable. The,17
NA,department may or may not wish to take over,17
NA,instruments which have been purchased pri-,17
NA,vately. That question will be better left for,17
NA,negotiation and determination when the time,17
NA,arrives.,17
NA,4. I f the instrument is the property of the,17
NA,subscriber and is removed from the telephone,17
NA,service the department would have no wish,17
NA,to acquire i t .,17
NA,5. Such a statement has been noticed i n the,17
NA,press.,17
NA,6. Yes; but to write off the cost of a tele-,17
NA,phone in five years would impose a heavy,17
NA,"burden on telephone subscribers, for i t would",17
NA,cause an altogether unnecessary inflation of,17
NA,telephone tariffs. Tlie department's attitude,17
NA,will be governed entirely by what i t believes,17
NA,to be in the best interests of telephone sub-,17
NA,"scribers as a body, and the question of",17
NA,economics is obviously an important factor.,17
NA,The department has already shown that i t does,17
NA,"not wish to arrest progress, even in the direc-",17
NA,tion of withholding permission for the instal-,17
NA,"lation of an instrument which, in certain cir-",17
NA,"cumstances, may be more conveniently used.",17
NA,"Naturally, however, those who wish to acquire",17
NA,a more modern instrument must expect to,17
NA,"contribute to the enhanced cost, for i t would",17
NA,be unreasonable that the increased charges,17
NA,should be passed on to the very large number,17

NA,of sala- duties now vested in the High Commis-,19
NA,sioner. I t is not the intention of the,19
NA,Government to fill at present,19
NA,vacancy brought about by,19
NA,the retirement of Sir . Granville,19
NA,Ryrie. The Minister without Portfolio,19
NA,( Mr Bruce) arrived in London prac-,19
NA,tically simultaneously with the ending,19
NA,"of Sir Granville Byrie's term of office,",19
NA,and it is intended that the right honorable,19
NA,gentleman shall remain in London for,19
NA,endowsome time as Besident Minister. I n that,19
NA,child capacity he will carry out most important,19
NA,work concerning Australianfinance.,19
NA,His first task will be to make arrange-,19
NA,ments for the conversion of the New,19
NA,paid South Wales loan which falls due in,19
NA,with November. I n addition he will perform,19
NA,of the duties ordinarily carried out by-the,19
NA,High Commissioner. Apart from the,19
NA,advantages expected from this arrange-,19
NA,"ment, certain economies will be effected.",19
NA,I t is intended that the operation of,19
NA,the proposed new section shall be limited,19
NA,to two years. No term has been set to,19
NA,the appointment of Mr Bruce as Besident,19
NA,Minister in London. The right honor-,19
NA,able gentleman will remain in the English,19
NA,PAPEES. capital so long as is deemed necessary to,19
NA,keep him there to carry out the important,19
NA,tasks to which I have referred. I f the,19
NA,arrangement is discontinued at any time,19
NA,"during the next two years, the Govern-",19
NA,ment will probably appoint a High,19
NA,Commissioner. The provisions of this,19
NA,bill will apply only while the position,19
NA,"held, by a Commonwealth Minister.",20
NA,Ii' experience should demonstrate that it,20
NA,"would be wise to continue, after Mr.",20
NA,"Bruce returns, to have a .Commonwealth",20
NA,Minister resident in London,20
Mr MAKIN ,Perhap s the present,20
NA,Prime Minister himself.,20
Mr LYONS ,Th e houorable gentle-,20
NA,man may rest assured that there is no,20
NA,possibility of that happening. Should,20
NA,experience prove that the Commonwealth,20
NA,would benefit by having a Resident,20
NA,Minister in London to perform these,20
NA,"duties i t ' will be necessary, after two",20
NA,"years, again to amend the High Com-",20
NA,missioner Act.,20
NA,"Mr Bruce being now in London, and",20
NA,"about to take up the duties of the office,",20
NA,it. is necessary to pass the bill without,20
NA,delay. I hope that honorable members,20
NA,will realize the desirability of having,20
NA,in London at the present time a Minister,20
NA,knowing the political and financial,20
NA,"circumstances of Australia, and able to",20
NA,carry out the important and delicate,20
NA,duties which have to be undertaken. I t,20
NA,will be agreed that Mr Bruce is at least,20
NA,as well qualified to perform the work of,20
NA,the High Commissioner's office as any,20
NA,gentleman who has preceded him as High,20
NA,"Commissioner, and I am confident that",20
NA,the right honorable gentleman will render,20
NA,real service to Australia while represent-,20
NA,ing the Commonwealth in London.,20
Mr SCULLIN ,Yarra) [3.39] -The,20
NA,bill is a much more important measure,20
NA,"than it, may at first appear,",20
NA,although it contains practically,20
NA,"isiily one clause, adding",20
NA,new section to the High Commissioner,20
NA,Act 1909. I f it merely provided for a,20
NA,temporary arrangement under which a,20
NA,Minister visiting London on a special,20
NA,mission would be empowered to carry out,20
NA,"the duties of High Commissioner, there",20
NA,"could be no real objection to tbe measure,",20
NA,and in suah circumstances I would not,20
NA,offer any. But it involves more than,20
NA,that. An announcement was made some,20
NA,time ago by the Prime Minister on behalf,20
NA,"of the Government that, in effect, a new",20
NA,policy was to be adopted; that we were,20
NA,to be governed partly from London; that,20
NA,we were to have a Besident Minister in,20
NA,.London; and that he would be the Bight,20
NA,Honorable S. M. Bruce.,20
NA,"When this bill is passed, it will give-",20
NA,the authority of this Parliament to the-,20
NA,principle of appointing a Besident Min-,20
NA,"ister abroad. That being so, one would,",20
NA,have expected the head of the Go-,20
NA,"vernment, when introducing this startling;",20
NA,innovation so far as Australian politics,20
NA,"are concerned, to put forward sound",20
NA,reasons to justify it. The Prime-,20
NA,"Minister said, in the first place, that",20
NA,there was some important work to bet,20
NA,done in London by the Minister whom it-,20
NA,is proposed to appoint. I believe that,20
NA,there is important work to be done in.,20
NA,London. I take no objection to the,20
NA,presence in London of a Minister at the,20
NA,"present time, and so long as important-",20
NA,"duties remain to be done, such as the",20
NA,"conversion of loans, I approve of a Min-",20
NA,ister from Australia being present in,20
NA,London. But is it contemplated that this,20
NA,"work will take two years, or even one",20
NA,year to accomplish? The conversion of,20
NA,our loans overseas to a lower rate of in-,20
NA,"terest is urgent. The Prime Minister,,",20
NA,"when sitting in opposition, once declared",20
NA,"publicly that, were he in power, his first",20
NA,act would be to go to London and arrange,20
NA,for the conversion of our overseas in-,20
NA,debtedness at a lower rate of interest;,20
NA,then he would come back to Australia and,20
NA,arrange the conversion of the Australian,20
NA,"debt. I n my opinion, he was putting the",20
NA,"cart before the horse, but, at any rate,",20
NA,so urgent did he believe the conversion of,20
NA,"our overseas indebtedness to be, that he",20
NA,would have undertaken the task im-,20
NA,mediately. My government believed that,20
NA,the first duty v/as to convert the Aus-,20
NA,tralian debt so as to give a lead to over-,20
NA,a seas bondholders; then we could approach,20
NA,"the overseas bondholders, telling them",20
NA,"that we had put our own house in order,",20
NA,and asking them to meet us. A con-,20
NA,siderable time has elapsed since the,20
NA,"Prime Minister assumed office, but",20
NA,nothing has been done to arrange for the,20
NA,conversion of our overseas indebtedness.,20
NA,I do not propose to offer any criticism,20
NA,at this juncture which might hamper the,20
NA,activities of the right honorable member,20
NA,for Flinders ( Mr Bruce) while he is in,20
NA,"London on a delicate mission. Indeed,",20
NA,anything I can do to help him I will,20
NA,"gladly do, because it is essential to Aus-",20
NA,tralia that interest rates be reduced to,20
NA,something corresponding to the price,20
NA,levels prevailing when the debts were,21
NA,"contracted. That, however, does not",21
NA,justify a proposal for keeping a per-,21
NA,manent or Resident Minister in London.,21
NA,There is no doubt that this appointment,21
NA,marks the beginning of a new policy. I f,21
NA,this Government is in office when the,21
NA,"period provided in the bill expires, the",21
NA,Prime Minister will be able to find the,21
NA,Same excuses for keeping the Resident,21
NA,Minister in London for a further term,21
NA,that he has now put forward for his,21
NA,appointment. The presence of a Min-,21
NA,ister in London at the present time to,21
NA,"consult with financial institutions, with",21
NA,"the heads of the Government, and with",21
NA,"subscribers to Australian: loans, is very",21
NA,"important, nordo I believe bhat this",21
NA,work could be done so effectively by,21
NA,"an officer, however capable, as by",21
NA,"a Minister. I maintain, however, that,",21
NA,"once the negotiations have been completed,",21
NA,and the contacts established by a respon-,21
NA,"sible Minister, the officer we now have in",21
NA,London as financial adviser could carry,21
NA,out the detailed work quite as capably as,21
NA,"any Minister. I shall go further, and say",21
NA,"that Mr Collins, with the experience he",21
NA,"had in the Treasury in Australia, and the",21
NA,"further experience he has had in London,",21
NA,would probably be able to carry out the,21
NA,detailed negotiations even better than,21
NA,could the Minister.,21
NA,What need is there to give power to the,21
NA,Resident Minister to administer Aus-,21
NA,tralia 1,21
NA,House? That institution,21
NA,is now being administered,21
NA,"Mr Collins, who has ^really done the",21
NA,work for over a year. The High Com-,21
NA,missioner is the representative of the,21
NA,"nation, and i f the nation can afford so",21
NA,costly a representative at the present time,21
NA,"to maintain our prestige, well and good.",21
NA,"In these times, however, I do not think",21
NA,that Australia can afford to maintain such,21
NA,"a position, and it is my opinion that, when",21
NA,the present term expires we should,21
NA,do in the case 'of the High Commissioner-,21
NA,ship what we have done in the case of the,21
NA,office of the Australian Commissioner-,21
NA,General in the United States of America.,21
Mr WHITE ,Th e Trade Commissioner,21
NA,acted on his own initiative.,21
Mr SCULLIN ,Th e honorable mem-,21
NA,ber for Balaclava does not know every-,21
NA,"thing about these matters, although he",21
NA,thinks that he does. I offer no criticism,21
NA,of our erstwhile representative in the,21
NA,United States of America. That gentle-,21
NA,"man knew the opinion, of the Government,",21
NA,and he tendered his resignation to me in,21
NA,a proper public 3pirit. I accepted the,21
NA,resignation in the same spirit.. The posi-,21
NA,tion in the United States of America be-,21
NA,came vacant by the resignation of the,21
NA,"Commissioner-General, and we did not fill",21
NA,"it, but we allowed the permanent secretary",21
NA,"to carry on, with the result that nothing",21
NA,"has been lost, and no interests have been",21
NA,"injured. I say deliberately, and by virtue",21
NA,"of the inside knowledge I possess, that",21
NA,Australia would be just as capably repre-,21
NA,sented at Australia House for the next,21
NA,twelve months or two years i f we allowed,21
NA,"Mr Collins to carry on, as i t has been dur-",21
NA,ing the last two years. Honorable mem-,21
NA,bers have to determine whether there is,21
NA,any justification for our representation,21
NA,"abroad on an elaborate scale, when we are",21
NA,forced at home to out and slash our,21
NA,expenditure inorder to: meet our obliga-,21
NA,tions.,21
NA,"The Prime Minister,, when, introducing",21
NA,"this measure,, made only one reference to",21
NA,costs. He said that a saving would be,21
NA,"effected by adopting the new proposal,",21
NA,but he gave no details. I have seen press,21
NA,statements to the effect that Mr Bruce,21
NA,will receive the same salary a3 would be,21
NA,paid to a High Commissioner. I do not,21
NA,know whether there was any authority,21
NA,for those statements.,21
Mr LYONS ,The y are correct.,21
Mr SCULLIN ,Tha t is the first inti-,21
NA,mation this House has had of the matter.,21
Mr LATHAM ,Th e expenditure is pro-,21
NA,vided for in the Estimates. Mr Bruce,21
NA,will receive the salary he would have,21
NA,"received had he remained here, and an",21
NA,allowance to make up his salary to what,21
NA,the High Commissioner has been receiv-,21
NA,"ing. There will be a saving, therefore,",21
NA,of the amount he would have received had,21
NA,he remained here.,21
Mr SCULLIN ," -I take it, then, that",21
NA,the amount of the saving will be deducted,21
NA,from the lump sum voted for ministerial,21
NA,"salaries. However, we could save the",21
NA,whole of the High Commissioner's salary,21
NA,"by not making an appointment, and,",21
NA,so far as the special mission is,21
NA,"concerned, all we should have to do",21
NA,would - be to continue paying his,21
NA,"ministerial salary to Mr Bruce, plus",21
NA,the expenses he incurs while abroad.,22
NA,That would he considerably less than the,22
NA,"extra amount which he is to be paid,",22
NA,"which is equivalent to more than £2,000",22
NA,per annum. We should keep that point,22
NA,in mind when we are told that a saving is,22
NA,to be made. The best way to effect a sav-,22
NA,"ing is to make no appointment at all, but",22
NA,to allow Mr Collins to continue in charge,22
NA,at Australia House. That would not be,22
NA,a tremendous obligation to impose on Mr.,22
NA,"Collins, who could be under the direction",22
NA,of Mr Bruce while the right honorable,22
NA,"member was in London, and-could be in-",22
NA,structed afterwards by the Cabinet. A l l,22
NA,Mr Bruce would then be entitled to draw,22
NA,during his special mission would be his,22
NA,"ministerial salary, plus an allowance for",22
NA,expenses. The Government proposes to,22
NA,provide for the right honorable member,22
NA,"not only a ministerial salary, but over",22
NA,"£2,000 a* year for expenses while Besident",22
NA,"Minister in London, and yet we are told",22
NA,that that will effect a saving. I t will,22
NA,be a saving -A saving could be made by,22
NA,not filling the position of High Commis-,22
NA,"sioner, and Australia would not suffer to",22
NA,any appreciable degree. I make that,22
NA,assertion advisedly.,22
NA,What is to be the position of the Resi-,22
NA,dent Minister in London? Will he take,22
NA,instructions from the Cabinet? He will,22
NA,occupy a unique position i f he does that.,22
NA,"Will he act on his own initiative, or will",22
NA,"he be part of the Cabinet, and keep in",22
NA,constant touch with Ministers in Aus-,22
NA,tralia by means of cablegrams and letters,22
NA,- a most unsatisfactory way of conduct-,22
NA,ing administration.,22
NA,Mr E. J. HARRISON -Th e,22
NA,honorablo member himself knows that.,22
NA,"Mr SCULLIN"" -S o does the Prime",22
NA,Minister. I have no qualms of,22
NA,conscience about the cablegrams sent,22
NA,"by me while absent from Australia; I ,",22
NA,"personally, was glad to read them",22
NA,"when published, and to know that",22
NA,the public were thus apprised of,22
NA,my honest opinions. A Besident Minis-,22
NA,ter in London could not maintain satis-,22
NA,factory communication with the Govern-,22
NA,ment in Australia for a lengthy period by,22
NA,"means of telegrams, radiograms, or letters.",22
NA,"Therefore, the Minister in London must",22
NA,act largely on his own responsibility.,22
Mr WHITE ,Tha t is why a Minister,22
NA,"rather than an official, is required there.",22
NA,MrSCULLIN - A government can,22
NA,give definite instructions to an official at,22
NA,"Australia House, but it will be impossible",22
NA,to give instructions to a Minister. I f,22
NA,"our representative were instructed, he",22
NA,"would cease to be a Minister, and would",22
NA,become a mere official. My confention,22
NA,is that the right honorable member for,22
NA,"Elinders ( Mr Bruce), having completed",22
NA,the special mission upon which he is,22
NA,"visiting Great Britain, should return to",22
NA,Australia. The principles of democracy,22
NA,demand that the representatives of the,22
NA,people in this Parliament shall keep as,22
NA,closely as possible in touch with their,22
NA,electorates. To make the right honorable,22
NA,member a permanent Besident Minister in,22
NA,London would be to disfranchise his con-,22
NA,stituents.,22
Mr WHITE ,Hi s electorate will be well,22
NA,looked after in his absence.,22
Mr SCULLIN ,It s needs were not,22
NA,not properly attended to when he represented,22
NA,it before.,22
NA,There is great reluctance on the part of,22
NA,the Government to state the real reason,22
NA,for sending the Minister abroad. I t is,22
NA,said that there is special work for him,22
NA,to do; but that is not an adequate reason.,22
NA,Special work has had to be done at,22
NA,"Ottawa, Lausanne, and Geneva. Is",22
NA,it seriously suggested that it is,22
NA,essential to have a Besident Minister,22
NA,in London because special work must,22
NA,be done there? What is the reason,22
NA,for sending a special Minister to,22
NA,"London, and what will be the term",22
NA,of his residence there? He will be out,22
NA,"right of touch with not only Australia, but",22
NA,also bis own constituents. Seeing that,22
NA,this bill authorizes the appointment of a,22
NA,"Besident Minister in London, and places",22
NA,the imprimatur of Parliament upon such,22
NA,"a procedure, the Opposition intends to",22
NA,"oppose the measure. The Prime Minister,",22
NA,in endeavouring to find a special argu-,22
NA,"ment in support of this proposal, set out",22
NA,to eulogize the right honorable member,22
NA,"who has gone abroad, and said that he",22
NA,was sure that he would represent Aus-,22
NA,tralia as well as any previous High,22
NA,Commissioner had done. We have,22
NA,not always been fortunate in the,22
NA,"choice of our High Commissioners, and",22
NA,I hope that an improvement will be,22
NA,brought about in this instance. I t seems,22
NA,to me that the basis of the Prime Minis-,23
NA,ter's argument is the exceptional experi-,23
NA,ence and profound knowledge of tlie right,23
NA,honorable member for Flinders. 1 do not,23
NA,"intend to indulge in personal criticism,",23
NA,particularly regarding a member who is,23
NA,absent. I read of the case for trade pre-,23
NA,ference presented by him on behalf of,23
NA,"Australia at Ottawa, aud I thought that",23
NA,he made out a strong claim. I am very,23
NA,"doubtful, however, regarding his judg-",23
NA,ment as to what should be conceded by,23
NA,"Australia, and I am waiting with grave",23
NA,anxiety to know how his judgment has,23
NA,been exercised in relation to concessions.,23
NA,I was not particularly impressed by the,23
NA,"right, honorable member's judgment on the",23
NA,"economic position generally, when he was",23
NA,"leader of a government, because I recall",23
NA,the warnings given by members ofmy,23
NA,party and by myself with regard to,23
NA,"our trade balance in 1926, 1927",23
NA,and 1928. The Bruce-Page Government,23
NA,was then warned of the disaster likely to,23
NA,overtake this country i f its policy,23
NA,continued. I recall the light and airy,23
NA,way iu which those warnings were dis-,23
NA,"missed by the.right honorable gentleman,",23
NA,who had not sufficient judgment to see,23
NA,what was likely to result from the action,23
NA,then taken.,23
NA,I am opposed to any government,23
NA,"of Australia from abroad, and I ob-",23
NA,ject to the appointment of a Besident,23
NA,Minister in London. I shall support the,23
NA,visit of a member of the Cabinet on any,23
NA,"special and important mission, and I",23
NA,"grant that there is important, work to lie",23
NA,done in London by the right honorable,23
NA,member on this occasion. I wish the right,23
NA,honorable gentleman every success in his,23
NA,"mission, and I hope that the result will",23
NA,be a reduction of the rate of interest on,23
NA,"our overseas loans; but, on. the comple-",23
NA,"tion of his mission, he should return to",23
NA,Australia to represent his constituents in,23
NA,this Parliament.,23
Mr LATHAM ,Kooyong-Attorney -,23
NA,General) [3.58] -Th e Leader of,23
NA,the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) has,23
NA,called attention to the obvious,23
NA,"fact that this bill proposes a change,",23
NA,"at least for the time being, in the character",23
NA,"of Australia's representation in London,",23
NA,and has justly asked for reasons in support,23
NA,of that change. Those reasons were given,23
NA,by the Prime Minister in moving the,23
NA,"second reading, and I propose shortly to",23
NA,develop one or two of them. I dissent,23
NA,from the view of the Leader of the Op-,23
NA,position as to the possibility of Australia,23
NA,being represented in London by some-,23
NA,"one other than, an official. I consider it",23
NA,most important to have efficient repre-,23
NA,"sentation of Australia in London, repre-",23
NA,sentation of a. character such that our,23
NA,"representative may stand alongside, and,",23
NA,"I hope, often above, the representatives",23
NA,of other countries. To have an official,23
NA,in a world centre such as London as the,23
NA,representative of a dominion or a foreign,23
NA,country is particularly unfortunate in,23
NA,many respects. I t necessarily and inevi-,23
NA,tably results in the impression being con-,23
NA,veyed that the country so represented is,23
NA,"of second-rate importance, and unable to",23
NA,obtain any one of distinction to represent,23
NA,it abroad. The Australian representa-,23
NA,tive in London has a tremendous field,23
NA,"for useful activity, and is able to exercise",23
NA,a wide influence in promoting the well-,23
NA,being of our' people. Discussions with,23
NA,people abroad may at the present time,23
NA,turn largely on finance. But there are,23
NA,other vitally important subjects. Aus-,23
NA,tralia's principal markets are in,23
NA,"Great Britain, and i t is important",23
NA,that we hold and extend them. The com-,23
NA,petition for them is intense at the present,23
NA,"time, and the Commonwealth must be",23
NA,kept well before the minds of the British,23
NA,people in order that we may have the full,23
NA,advantage of not only the quality of our,23
NA,"products, but also that sentimental in-",23
NA,terest in the dominions which is of great,23
NA,importance to - Australia's exporting,23
NA,trade.,23
Mr GREGORY ,W e want a business,23
NA,man with commercial capacity rather,23
NA,than a politician.,23
Mr LATHAM , A representative,23
NA,whose ability and distinction appeal to,23
NA,the minds of the British people is worth,23
NA,"a great deal more than a mere office man,",23
NA,however great may be his commercial,23
NA,"knowledge. Of course, we must have a",23
NA,"well-qualified commercial staff, but we",23
NA,particularly need a man whose eminence,23
NA,"catches the public imagination, and who",23
NA,is able to make a contribution to the,23
NA,public life of not only the Common-,23
NA,"wealth, but also the Mother Country",23
NA,itself. Great endeavours have been made,23
NA,to increase the consumption of dominion,23
NA,"products in Great Britain, and excellent",24
NA,work to that end has been done by the,24
NA,Empire Marketing Board. Australia,24
NA,must do everything possible to maintain,24
NA,its commercial reputation and prestige,24
NA,"abroad, for I assure honorable members",24
NA,that prestige is a highly important,24
NA,element in both finance and trade.,24
NA,This bill is not brought forward for,24
NA,the purpose of introducing a^new general,24
NA,principle. From time to time the relative,24
NA,advantages of a High Commissioner or a,24
NA,Besident Minister to represent dominions,24
NA,in London have been discussed. I have,24
NA,never accepted j t as a general principle,24
NA,that Australia would be most effectively,24
NA,represented by a Besident Minister.,24
NA,While that system would have advan-,24
NA,tages it would have also great disadvan-,24
NA,tages. I t is true that Canada has on,24
NA,occasions been represented by a Besident,24
NA,"Minister, but it is very much easier for",24
NA,him to keep in direct contact with his,24
NA,colleagues than it would be for an Aus-,24
NA,tralian Minister resident in London.,24
NA,Amongst the advantages of having a,24
NA,Besident Minister would be that he would,24
NA,have an authority abroad which no other,24
NA,appointee could have. He would be able,24
NA,"to speak directly for his Government, and",24
NA,in all negotiations would achieve more,24
NA,a shorter space of time than would any,24
NA,-official. He would also be in closer,24
NA,-contact with his Government.,24
NA,element of authority which he would en-,24
NA,joy would play an important part in,24
NA,dealings with representatives of other,24
NA,countries. When it is known that the,24
NA,representative of a dominion has full,24
NA,authority to aet for the Government of,24
NA,"that country, much more can be achieved",24
NA,than when discussions with a High Com-,24
NA,missioner or other official are known to,24
NA,be merely preliminary and provisional.,24
NA,"On the other hand,' a system of represenI",24
NA,tation in London by a Besident Minister,24
NA,would possess distinct disadvantages. I t,24
NA,could not be adopted as a general prin-,24
NA,"ciple, because often it would be im-",24
NA,possible for a Minister to be absent for,24
NA,a considerable length of time from this,24
NA,Parliament and from his constituency.,24
NA,"Therefore, the innovation now proposed",24
NA,may be regarded as only an experiment,24
NA,to meet special circumstances. I n the,24
NA,highly-important financial negotiations,24
NA,that must be conducted during the next,24
NA,"few months, it is of the utmost",24
NA,importance that the man who speaks,24
NA,on behalf of Australia shall be vested,24
NA,with the maximum of authority.,24
NA,Direct conversational dealing is worth,24
NA,many months of indirect negotia-,24
NA,tion through an official. The Minister,24
NA,without Portfolio ( Mr Bruce) possesses,24
NA,special qualifications for doing the work,24
NA,"for which he has been appointed, and it",24
NA,would be very difficult for the Official,24
NA,"Secretary, competent as he is, to achieve",24
NA,as much as the man with the status of a,24
NA,former Prime Minister and late Assistant-,24
NA,Treasurer of the Commonwealth. The,24
NA,loan conversions will involve mainly,24
NA,direct negotiation with individuals and,24
NA,"institutions, and as a result of my own",24
NA,"experience in London recently, I am con-",24
NA,vinced that the Minister will achieve,24
NA,"much more than could any official, how-",24
NA,ever competent. The passage of this bill,24
NA,is necessary to enable the right honorable,24
NA,member for Flinders to control the stalf,24
NA,of Australia House. Its operation is,24
NA,"limited to two years, and the Minister in",24
NA,London will exercise the functions men-,24
NA,tioned in the bill only during the pleasure,24
NA,of the Governor-General. The object of,24
NA,that provision is to put it beyond doubt,24
NA,in that any appointment under this legisla-,24
NA,tion will not be even remotely binding on,24
NA,any subsequent administration -,24
Mr GREGORY ,Wha t is the salary of,24
NA,the High Commissioner?,24
Mr LATHAM ,"Th e salary is £3,000,",24
NA,"plus an allowance of £2,000, both amounts",24
NA,"being subject to a 25 per cent, reduction",24
NA,under the financial emergency legislation.,24
NA,While the right honorable member for,24
NA,Flinders is doing the work of the High,24
NA,"Commissioner, lie will receive these re-",24
NA,"duced amounts, and a saving equivalent",24
NA,to his ministerial salary will be effected.,24
NA,"ask the House to accept the bill, not as",24
NA,"a measure introducing a new principle,",24
NA,but because it will enable us to have the,24
NA,benefit of the services of the right honor-,24
NA,able member for Flinders in London in,24
NA,connexion with highly important financial,24
NA,transactions during the next few months.,24
NA,The Government does not intend to pro-,24
NA,long this appointment beyond what the,24
NA,necessities of the case demand-. I n con-,24
NA,"nexion with these matters, it is very often",24
NA,difficult to state publicly what the neces-,24
NA,"sities of the case are, because financial",24
NA,transactions may depend upon personal,24
NA,"negotiations, sometimes intimate, and",25
NA,"always private, which, would be rendered",25
NA,abortive i f publicity were given to them.?,25
NA,I consider that the Commonwealth is for-,25
NA,tunate in being able to obtain the services,25
NA,of the right honorable member for Flin-,25
NA,"ders in London at this juncture, and for",25
NA,the special task which he has been asked,25
NA,to undertake.,25
Dr EARLE PAGE ,Cowper) [4.10] -,25
NA,I congratulate the Government upon the,25
NA,step it has taken. My only criticism of,25
NA,the bill is that it does not go far enough.,25
NA,I object to the limitation of the appoint-,25
NA,ment to two years; that restriction could,25
NA,have been imposed later i f the experiment,25
NA,proved unsatisfactory. I am disappointed,25
NA,also that there is no provision for negotia-,25
NA,tion .with the States for the abolition of,25
NA,"the office of Agdnt-General, so that Aus-",25
NA,tralia might be wholly represented by a,25
NA,Minister of this Parliament.,25
Mr GABB ,Thos e positions are kept,25
NA,as political plums.,25
Dr EARLE PAGE , I welcome the,25
NA,"policy contained i n this bill because,",25
NA,"while it continues, the position of High",25
NA,Commissioner will no longer be a political,25
NA,plum. I have no complaint to make of,25
NA,the gentlemen who have filled that office,25
NA,in the past. All had distinguished them-,25
NA,"selves in the public life of Australia, but",25
NA,none of them returned to this Parliament,25
NA,to enrich it with the increased 'knowledge,25
NA,which they must have gained by their,25
NA,"residence and contacts abroad. I n future,",25
NA,if the system of appointing a Resident,25
NA,"Minister in London be continued, a mem-",25
NA,ber of this Parliament will discharge that,25
NA,"duty, and he will be obliged to return here",25
NA,to give to Parliament and to his con-,25
NA,stituents an account of his stewardship.,25
NA,One reason why I have always advocated,25
NA,the appointment of a Resident Minister,25
NA,in London is the .need for widening the,25
NA,circle of men in this Parliament who have,25
NA,definite and intimate kaowledge of con-,25
NA,ditions and governing authorities on the,25
NA,other side of the world. I f there is one,25
NA,matter in respect of which Australia com-,25
NA,pares unfavorably with some of the other,25
NA,"dominions, it is the failure of its people",25
NA,to realize the international position they,25
NA,have attained since the Great War. The,25
NA,Commonwealth must have international,25
NA,contacts. The increasing extent and dis-,25
NA,tribution of its trade make it essential,25
NA,that this Parliament shall contain men,25
NA,with experience abroad. I have always,25
NA,hoped that the constant return to the,25
NA,Commonwealth Parliament of men who,25
NA,had served for a year or so as Resident,25
NA,Minister abroad would gradually build,25
NA,up from all parties-becaus e as govern-,25
NA,ments changed the ministerial representa-,25
NA,tion abroad would change-committee s,25
NA,"of members, qualified to advise govern-",25
NA,"ments in regard to external affairs, thus",25
NA,creating a definite interest in Imperial,25
NA,and foreign policy. A striking feature,25
NA,of the debates of this Parliament is the,25
NA,entire absence of comment on foreign re-,25
NA,lations ; we seem to be absorbed in our in-,25
NA,ternal politics.,25
Mr BEASLEY ,W e do not get a chance,25
NA,to discuss other matters.,25
Dr EARLE PAGE ,Th e character,25
NA,of the business-paper does not vary much,25
NA,with changes of government. One ex-,25
NA,planation is that there are not in this,25
NA,Parliament sufficient men who have had,25
NA,extensive experience abroad and made,25
NA,-intimate contacts with governments and,25
NA,public men in other countries. Although,25
NA,I have always advocated the appointment,25
NA,"of a Besident Minister in London, there",25
NA,"was, in the past, one valid objection to it,",25
NA,"namely, the difficulty of maintaining close",25
NA,contact between the Minister overseas,25
NA,"and the Government here, but since the'",25
NA,invention of wireless telephony that dis-,25
NA,advantage has been removed. There is,25
NA,no reason why the Minister overseas,25
NA,"should not, i f necessary, be in daily per-",25
NA,sonal contact with the Government of,25
NA,Australia that will remove the,25
NA,"grave danger that there was previously,",25
NA,of the representative overseas committing,25
NA,"his Government, without previous dis-",25
NA,"cussion with it, to an undesirable policy.",25
NA,Another reason why there should be a,25
NA,Besident Minister representing the,25
NA,Government of Australia in Great,25
NA,"Britain, is that the status of the",25
NA,Governor-General has altered during the,25
NA,past few years. At present that office,25
NA,is held by an Australian who has not had,25
NA,the opportunity that previous Governor-,25
NA,Generals had of being in touch with the,25
NA,British Government or with His Majesty,25
NA,himself.,25
Dr MALONEY ,A n Australian is a,25
NA,better representative.,25
Dr EARLE PAGE , I am not,26
NA,now criticizing the action,26
NA,the previous Government in appointing,26
NA,an Australian as the Governor-,26
NA,"General, but that appointment has",26
NA,made it more necessary for us,26
NA,to have a direct representative of the,26
NA,Government of Australia in Great,26
NA,"Britain, so as to keep us fully informed",26
NA,of tho position overseas. I recognize the,26
NA,difficulty of obtaining the services of a,26
NA,man suitable for the position. A member,26
NA,of this House having a doubtful,26
NA,electorate could not afford to be absent,26
NA,from Australia during the last year of a,26
NA,"Parliament, but that difficulty could be",26
NA,overcome to some extent by appointing,26
NA,to the position during the first year of,26
NA,Parliament a representative of the House,26
NA,"ef Eepresentatives, and during the last",26
NA,"two years of Parliament, a representative",26
NA,"of the Senate. Thus, during a period of",26
NA,six years at least two members of this,26
NA,"House, and four members of the Senate",26
NA,would hold the position of Resident,26
NA,Minister in London. I have no doubt,26
NA,that if a Minister were absent in Great,26
NA,"Britain, and an election took place, some",26
NA,other honorable member would he pre-,26
NA,pared to handle his constituency for him.,26
NA,I f that were done we should save con-,26
NA,siderable expense in connexion with the,26
NA,enforced visits of Ministers overseas.,26
Mr GABB ,Coul d we prevent forced,26
NA,visits ?,26
Dr EARLE PAGE ,Sinc e the,26
NA,formation of the Loan Council and,26
NA,handling of the conversion of loans by,26
NA,"council, there has practically been",26
NA,cessation of the visits of State premiers,26
NA,and treasurers which used to take place,26
NA,so regularly in previous years. The fact,26
NA,that the Attorney-General was overseas,26
NA,recently enabled the Lausanne negotiathe,26
NA,tions to be completed. During the,26
NA,years that the previous Government,26
NA,in office four Ministers went overseas.,26
NA,"I do not cavil at that, because I have",26
NA,always maintained that i t should be,26
NA,necessary for every member of this,26
NA,Parliament to be brought into contact,26
NA,with international and imperial affairs.,26
NA,I have never objected to the visits of,26
NA,"Ministers overseas, because they are",26
NA,for the good of Australia. Unfortunately,26
NA,our Ministers generally have little,26
NA,intimate contact with foreign affairs.,26
NA,With regard to the position of High,26
NA,"of Commissioner, this gentleman is",26
NA,"appointed for five years, and there is",26
NA,"usually, during that period, a change of",26
NA,Government. When that takes place the,26
NA,"High Commissioner, who is probably a",26
NA,"political appointee, is no longerin close",26
NA,contact -with the Government that he is,26
NA,"supposed to represent, and that Govern-",26
NA,ment does not feel disposed to consult,26
NA,him to the extent that it would consult,26
NA,"a member of its own Cabinet, i f he were",26
NA,resident in London. I welcome the,26
NA,entrance into this Parliament of the hon-,26
NA,"orable member for Corio ( Mr Casey),",26
NA,who has had considerable experience of,26
NA,imperial and foreign policy. Because of,26
NA,"his knowledge, he is a valuable asset to",26
NA,this Parliament. I f every year or second,26
NA,"year, men with similar experience",26
NA,and qualifications were returned to,26
NA,"this Parliament, we should be",26
NA,able to appoint a committee,26
NA,on imperial and foreign affairs with the,26
NA,object of framing a definite policy and,26
NA,laying down a nationaltradition in,26
NA,respect thereto. I t is a mistake to,26
NA,"limit this appointment to two years,",26
NA,and I regret that the Attorney-General,26
NA,( Mr Latham) has stated that when the,26
NA,present occupant of the position returns,26
NA,to. Australia there will probably be,26
NA,an appointment for five years. In,26
NA,"eighteen months' or two years' time,",26
NA,"special circumstances may arise, which,",26
NA,being beyond the control of a High,26
NA,"Commissioner, will warrant the sending",26
NA,the overseas of a capable Minister. I,26
NA,the join with the Prime Minister and the,26
NA,a Attorney-General in saying that as the,26
NA,Ministers who become specially qualified,26
NA,for this particular mission return to Aus-,26
NA,"tralia, the status of the position will",26
NA,become so important that it will become,26
NA,custom for this Government to be,26
NA,two represented in Great Britain by a,26
NA,was Minister. I shall support the bill.,26
Mr BEASLEY ,West Sydney) [4.23].,26
NA,- I listened with interest to the speeches,26
NA,of the Prime Minister ( Mr Lyons) and,26
NA,the Attorney-General ( Mr Latham).,26
NA,They certainly made heavy weather in,26
NA,endeavouring to justify the action of the,26
NA,all Government in making this new appoint-,26
NA,ment. I also gathered from those speeches,26
NA,that we have not beeu informed of all the,26
NA,reasons for the appointment.,26
Mr HOLLOWAY , The honorable mem-,27
NA,ber could not expect that.,27
Mr BEASLEY ,On e could hardly ex-,27
NA,pect to be informed of all the reasons f or,27
NA,"this appointment, but i f we cannot obtain",27
NA,information from the Government we are,27
NA,"entitled to draw our own conclusions, and",27
NA,to express them as the opportunity arises.,27
NA,The bill provides that the Besident Minis-,27
NA,ter will exercise the powers of the High,27
NA,Commissioner. I t is stated that i t is,27
NA,necessary to make this appointment in,27
NA,order that the work previously performed,27
NA,by the H i g h Commissioner may be carried,27
NA,out by the right houorable member for,27
NA,"Flinders, and that there is no intention,",27
NA,"at the moment, of filling the vacant",27
NA,position by appointing another High,27
NA,Commissioner. I t is quite likely that,27
NA,"the Government, f or political reasons,",27
NA,"does not, at present, wish to fill",27
NA,this vacancy. The Leader of the,27
NA,Country party (Dr Earle Page) seems,27
NA,to have as much knowledge of this,27
NA,appointment as the Prime Minister him-,27
NA,"self. For instance, he suggested that a",27
NA,"Besident Minister might be appointed,",27
NA,and that the office might be held alter-,27
NA,nately by members of this House,27
NA,and ' of the Senate. I f that sug-,27
NA,"gestion is to be given effect, I can forecast",27
NA,that probably after the lapse of twelve,27
NA,months the right honorable member,27
NA,for Flinders ( Mr Bruce) w i l l return,27
NA,from London and Seuator Sir George,27
NA,"Pearce will take his place. Later, circum-",27
NA,stances may arise to compel the Govern-,27
NA,ment to fill the position of H i g h Com-,27
NA,missioner in London.,27
Mr LYONS ,"Th e Government, i f i t",27
NA,"wished, could do that to-morrow.",27
Mr BEASLEY , I t is true that the,27
NA,"Government ha3 that power, but i t may",27
NA,"not be prudent to exercise i t just now,",27
NA,in view of the political position.,27
NA,Prime Minister has had a varied ex-,27
NA,"perience of political exigencies, and I",27
NA,have no doubt that he w i l l have a wider,27
NA,experience as time goes on.,27
Mr GABB ,I s that a threat or a,27
NA,promise ?,27
Mr BEASLEY , I do not make,27
NA,"threats, nor am I competent to make",27
NA,promises. I n these times i t is not,27
NA,possible f or any honorable member to,27
NA,make predictions regarding the political,27
NA,future.,27
Mr WHITE , I s the honorable membei,27
NA,referring to New South Wales?,27
Mr BEASLEY , I f an opportunity,27
NA,"presented itself at the present time,",27
NA,some big changes would take place,27
NA,in that State. I t has been definitely,27
NA,stated by the Prime Minister that,27
NA,the Besident Minister w i l l deal with,27
NA,the conversion of loans. I agree entirely,27
NA,with the remarks of the Leader of the,27
NA,Opposition ( Mr Scullin) on this subject.,27
NA,Mr Collins has previously undertaken,27
NA,"this work, and I claim that he has been",27
NA,a competent and capable officer. I know,27
NA,f r o m my own experience that during the,27
NA,"regime of the Scullin Government, Mr .",27
NA,Collins did great work for this country.,27
NA,Therefore all this talk by members of,27
NA,the Government about the necessity to,27
NA,appoint as Besident Minister a man of,27
NA,"high prestige and standing, is mere make-",27
NA,"believe, the intention being to provide a",27
NA,suitable environment f o r the right,27
NA,honorable member for Flinders. The,27
NA,Attorney-General said that the appointee,27
NA,will not confine his activities to the work,27
NA,"of conversion alone, and that he w i l l be",27
NA,employed in a number .of other spheres,27
NA,in which his services w i l l be invaluable.,27
NA,The disposal of our primary products i n,27
NA,foreign markets was mentioned. I under-,27
NA,stand that already we have i n London,27
NA,trade representatives whose special duty,27
NA,it is to provide markets for our products.,27
NA,"Mr Devereux, when associated with the",27
NA,"Development and Migration Commission,",27
NA,was transferred by the late Government,27
NA,to London i n order to reduce the expense,27
NA,occasioned by the high salaries paid to,27
NA,men appointed on long-term contracts,27
NA,by the Bruce-Page Government. As,27
NA,"Mr Devereux is i n London, doing work",27
NA,"in connexion with the wool industry,",27
NA,there is no necessity f o r the Besident,27
NA,Minister to assist i n that direction.,27
NA,The,27
NA,A gentleman f r o m the Queensland De-,27
NA,partment of Agriculture ( Mr Mac-,27
NA,Gregor) was also sent to London.,27
Mr SCULLIN ,H e is a very capable,27
NA,officer.,27
Mr BEASLEY ," H e must be, f o r the",27
NA,present Government made arrangements,27
NA,for him to be in Ottawa during the recent,27
NA,"conference, to advise on certain aspects of",27
NA,the negotiations. A l l the circumstances,27
NA,go to show that there is no justification,27
NA,whatever for adding to Australia's repreHe,28
NA,sentation i n Great B r i t a i n by having,28
NA,Besident Minister there permanently.,28
NA,This is not the real reason f o r the,28
NA,making of this appointment.,28
NA,The expense involved i u this new de-,28
NA,parture was mentioned by the Leader of,28
NA,"the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), who",28
NA,steps to obtain additional information London.,28
NA,under this heading. I am not satisfied,28
NA,with the information furnished to h i,28
NA,Something has been said about the alleged,28
NA,saving as between the salary of a Minister,28
NA,and that of the H i g h Commissioner;,28
NA,the fact is that the expense has probably are laughable.,28
NA,hardly commenced. I direct attention to,28
NA,one small point which may interest,28
NA,"struggling farmers i n the outback, unemPrime",28
NA,"ployed workers i n the cities, and other",28
NA,Australian people whose paymentSjibecause,28
NA,"of our social welfare legislation, have",28
NA,reduced. The first thing that we heard,28
NA,from this right honorable gentleman after,28
NA,his arrival i n London was that the,28
NA,mansion i n which he was to reside was,28
NA,not satisfactory to him and would have to,28
NA,be renovated. Apparently he did not like,28
NA,the pattern of the wallpaper on the bath-,28
NA,"room or somewhere else, and i t had to be",28
NA,torn down and replaced. I am under the,28
NA,impression that this palatial residence,28
NA,"was renovated, or a considerable sum of",28
NA,"money spent on i t , only about three years",28
NA,ago. I should like to hear what honor-,28
NA,able members opposite would say i f some,28
NA,of our citizens who are on the basic wage,28
NA,were to complain that the homes provided since then.,28
NA,under this wage scale were not decorated,28
NA,"according to their tastes, and must thereright",28
NA,fore be renovated.,28
Mr WHITE ,Surel y the honorable,28
NA,member realizes that this is providing,28
NA,work.,28
Mr BEASLEY , W i t h all due respect,28
NA,"to the British workers, I want any money",28
NA,-that Ave have to spend on work of this,28
NA,description to be spent here.,28
NA,"British workers get all they can, but",28
NA,at the expense of the Australian workers.,28
NA,1 shall not vote f o r the expenditure,28
NA,Great Britain of any money made availspecial qualifications.,28
NA,able to the Government by the Australian,28
NA,taxpayers. Under existing conditions we,28
NA,"should spend our money here, to help",28
NA,own people. The right honorable gentlehonorable,28
NA,man who has gone to London does not live,28
NA,the life of the ordinary Australian citizen.,28
NA,has been fortunate i n lif e compared,28
NA,"a with many of us, and has not had to live",28
NA,under conditions which have been the lot,28
NA,"of most of us. As a result, his tastes",28
NA,are very expensive.,28
NA,I come now to a consideration of,28
NA,the qualifications of this gentleman f o r,28
NA,took the position of Besident Minister in,28
NA,The Prime Minister ( Mr .,28
NA,Lyons) has had a good deal to say on,28
NA,"m . this aspect of the subject, and to any",28
NA,one who remembers the speeches he made,28
NA,on the same subject during the election,28
NA,"but campaign of 1929, his statements to-day",28
NA,We know that i n 1929,28
NA,"he declared on many public platforms, i n",28
NA,"his own State in particular, that the",28
NA,Minister of that day ( Mr Bruce),28
NA,"was an utter failure, and was mainly re-",28
NA,sponsible for the situation i n wliich the,28
NA,beeu country had been placed. As a member,28
NA,"of the Labour party of that day, the",28
NA,"present Prime Minister travelled north,",28
NA,"south, east and west i n Tasmania,",28
NA,"exhorting, the people to remove the then",28
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Bruce) fro m office.,28
Mr LYONS ,An d he did i t success-,28
NA,fully.,28
Mr BEASLEY , T h a t is ee. I t was,28
NA,done with a' vengeance. I t cannot truly,28
NA,"be said, therefore, that the Leader of this",28
NA,Government had much regard then f o r,28
NA,the qualifications of the gentleman who,28
NA,has now gone to London.,28
NA,NA,28
Mr BEASLEY , I will not do the,28
NA,honorable gentleman such an i n -,28
NA,justice as to say that. He is not a school-,28
NA,boy i n public affairs in Australia. He,28
NA,"has had considerable experience, and I",28
NA,believe that i n 1929 he earnestly and,28
NA,sincerely believed that the economic,28
NA,situation of this country had been brought,28
NA,about almost entirely through the malad-,28
NA,ministration of the Government which,28
NA,Let the the right honorable member f or Flinders,28
NA,not ( Mr Bruce) was then leading. Nothing,28
NA,has happened since then to equip this,28
NA,i n right honorable gentleman w i t h any,28
NA,We know that,28
NA,immediately after that election campaign,28
NA,he left this country f o r Great Britain. I,28
NA,our do not wish to be unjust to the right,28
NA,"gentleman, but I am entitled to",28
NA,say that during one of the most critical,28
NA,periods in the history of Australia he did,28
NA,not remain here to lend a helping hand,29
NA,in getting the country out of the difficul-,29
NA,ties into which he had allowed it to be,29
NA,placed. I suppose there will be a squeal,29
NA,from honorable members generally when,29
NA,I say that the right honorable gentleman,29
NA,left Australia for England immediately,29
NA,"after the 1929 election campaign, in order",29
NA,to look after the interests abroad of,29
NA,"Paterson, Laing and Bruce Limited. He",29
NA,did not serve this country in any respect,29
NA,whatever in those difficult days. Many,29
NA,"newspapers, quite opposed to Labour sen-",29
NA,"timents and policies, published vigorous",29
NA,articles protesting against Mr Bruce,29
NA,leaving this country so quickly after his,29
NA,defeat at the polls by the present mem-,29
NA,ber for Melbourne Ports ( Mr Hollo-,29
NA,"way), seeing that he was to a large extent",29
NA,responsible for its parlous economic con-,29
NA,dition at that time. He had been Prime,29
NA,"Minister for about seven years, and his",29
NA,administration had been so unsatisfac-,29
NA,tory that the people rejected his leader-,29
NA,"ship. He, on his part, was not prepared",29
NA,then to stand hy. He left the country,29
NA,"precipitately, and went to London to",29
NA,"serve the interests of Paterson, Laing",29
NA,and Bruce Limited. I t is to be hoped,29
NA,"that he will, on the occasion of this visit,",29
NA,pay more attention to the affairs of Aus-,29
NA,tralia than to the affairs of that firm.,29
NA,I do not regard this gentleman as,29
NA,competent to express the views of the,29
NA,tralian .people. I think I am correct,29
NA,saying that during the - last election,29
NA,campaign he did not utter a single word,29
NA,from the public platform in this country,29
NA,"and played no part whatever in bringpay,",29
NA,ing about the change of government that,29
NA,occurred.,29
Mr LYONS ,Bu t he gained an extrato,29
NA,ordinary victory in his own electorate.,29
Mr BEASLEY , I have no doubt that,29
NA,many of the extraordinary victories,29
NA,gained at the last election will never,29
NA,repeated. That statement is not a have,29
NA,"threat; it is a philosophical observation,",29
NA,the truth of which time will determine.,29
NA,"""We have been told that the Besident",29
NA,Minister in London is to handle our the,29
NA,conversion operations overseas.,29
NA,Monday night I had the opportunity of,29
NA,hearing a speech on this subject by the,29
NA,"last Agent-General for New South Wales,",29
NA,Mr Willis. He told us that when he our troubles.,29
NA,first took steps to bring about the conver-,29
NA,"sion of certain Australian securities, he",29
NA,found great difficulty in getting from the,29
NA,Westminster Bank the names of those,29
NA,with whom he had to deal. He,29
NA,"went on to say, that like other Austra-",29
NA,"lians, he had heard that our securities",29
NA,were held in London by a large number,29
NA,of small holders. When he was able to,29
NA,"get at the facts, he found that this was",29
NA,"not so, but that the great bulk of our",29
NA,stocks were in the handsof a few indi-,29
NA,"viduals. However, he embarked upon a",29
NA,discussion of conversion prospects with,29
NA,"the people concerned, and was making",29
NA,fairly satisfactory progress. He showed,29
NA,them that it was impossible for the people,29
NA,of this country to continue paying the,29
NA,exorbitant interest rates that were being,29
NA,"demanded, and the people with whom he",29
NA,was dealing were coming to see that this,29
NA,"was so. But one day, when his negotia-",29
NA,"tions had reached a most promising point,",29
NA,"the representative"" of the people with",29
NA,"whom he was in contact, presented to him",29
NA,a statement by the Prime Minister of,29
NA,Australia to the effect that the Common-,29
NA,"wealth would pay every penny she owed,",29
NA,notwithstanding the high interest rates;,29
NA,and that the Government was prepared to,29
NA,"cut and slash wages, social services, and so",29
NA,on-a s it has done and is still doing-,29
NA,being in order that the people who held our,29
NA,Aussecurities should get every penny of,29
NA,"in interest. The gentleman then, said some-",29
NA,"thing to this effect to him: "" I may agree",29
NA,with everything you say to me about the,29
NA,capacity of the people of Australia to,29
NA,the deplorable condition of the coun-,29
NA,"try, and the necessity for a reduction of",29
NA,"interest rates, but how can you expect",29
NA,get interest rates reduced when your,29
NA,Prime Minister makes statements of this,29
NA,"kind?"" The whole of the business then",29
NA,in hand was upset. The irresistible in-,29
NA,ference from Mr Willis' speech was that,29
NA,be Australia's external debt position could,29
NA,been rectified long ago i f the leaders,29
NA,of our various governments and those,29
NA,actively engaged in the political life of,29
NA,this country had had the courage to face,29
NA,position. I f the affairs of this coun-,29
NA,On try had not been in the hands of men,29
NA,addicted to such political hypocrisy in,29
NA,"regard to the meeting of our obligations,",29
NA,we could have overcome at least some of,29
NA,I hold the view that the right honorable,30
NA,gentleman who has gone overseas to,30
NA,present Australia has not an Australian,30
NA,outlook on our problems. He has not,30
NA,lived in an environment which lent itself,30
NA,to the assimilation of Australian,30
NA,ment. I do not regard his opinions,30
NA,expressing in any -sense whatever,30
NA,view of the people of this country.,30
NA,NA,30
NA,look is not necessarily the right one.,30
Mr BEASLEY ,A n honorable gentlethat,30
NA,"man from Scotland is now interjecting,",30
NA,but I refuse to argue with him on the,30
NA,Australian outlook. I was born and,30
NA,"bred in this country, and so were my",30
NA,parents. I shall not enter into a consubordinate,30
NA,troversy with my Scottish friend on this,30
NA,subject. The gentleman who has gone,30
NA,overseas is not competent to handle,30
NA,"affairs in an Australian way,",30
NA,according to the view of the Australian,30
NA,"people, and in these circumstances I shall",30
NA,take whatever steps I can to bring about,30
NA,the defeat of this measure.,30
Mr FORDE ,Capricornia) [4.42] -,30
NA,No justification 'has been advanced for,30
NA,the appointment of a Besident Minister,30
NA,"in London and, as the Leader of the",30
NA,Opposition ( Mr Scullin) has rightly,30
NA,"said, the appointment should not",30
NA,have been made. We already,30
NA,had an able financial adviser in,30
NA,London. Those who have been in close,30
NA,association with the gentleman know,30
NA,very well that 'he has done his work most Leader of the Country Party.,30
NA,satisfactorily. He was specially selected,30
NA,from the Commonwealth Public Service,30
NA,as a man of outstanding qualifications,30
NA,"financial matters, and was sent to London",30
NA,to keep in touch with the Bank of Engthing,30
NA,land and other big financial interests there,30
NA,for the purpose of advising the Governorable,30
NA,"ment from time to time, and he has done",30
NA,"hi3 work well. A time of depression,",30
NA,"as the present, when the Government is",30
NA,slashing at invalid and old-age pensions,30
NA,"and at other public services, is inopporLondon,",30
NA,tune for incurring new expenditure of this,30
NA,kind. I t is true that it is carrying,30
NA,its election promises to one person. I t,30
NA,promised that it would find lucrative,30
NA,"ployment for the people, and it has emanknowledge",30
NA,cipated the right honorable gentleman,30
NA,"who has gone to London, for i t has prober",30
NA,vided him with a position carrying,30
NA,"salary of about £5,000 a year, less a per-",30
NA,recentage reduction. Eut what about the,30
NA,great mass of the people for whom it has,30
NA,done nothing? While the right honorable,30
NA,member for Flinders ( Mr Bruce) was,30
NA,"sentiout of public life, after the 1929",30
NA,"as election, he spent at least half",30
NA,the his time in London looking after the,30
NA,"affairs of Paterson, Laing and Bruce",30
NA,Limited. His re-entry into public life,30
NA,not well pleasing to a certain section,30
NA,"of the Nationalist party, who realized",30
NA,he had brought this country to the,30
NA,verge of bankruptcy. The right honorable,30
NA,gentleman was not a popular figure in,30
NA,"our public life, but he has a dominating",30
NA,"personality, and was not satisfied with a",30
NA,"position, in the Government.",30
NA,"Therefore this position abroad, which is",30
NA,"a sinecure, was found for him, and a",30
NA,our salary was 'provided of approximately,30
NA,"and £5,000 a year less deductions.",30
Mr LYONS ,Th e deductions amount to,30
NA,"nearly £2,000 a year.",30
Mr FORDE ,N o doubt the right hon-,30
NA,orable member for Flinders has been put,30
NA,in this position until the Leader of the,30
NA,Country party (Dr Earle Page) and cer-,30
NA,tain other honorable gentlemen can bring,30
NA,"about a reconstruction of the Government,",30
NA,in which event certain ex-members of this,30
NA,party who are now occupying seats on,30
NA,the ministerial bench will be jettisoned.,30
NA,I was most interested in listening to the,30
NA,speech of the right honorable the,30
NA,I,30
NA,recall that when the right honorable mem-,30
NA,ber for Flinders ( Mr Bruce) was.,30
NA,"in defeated in 1929, some Nationalist news-",30
NA,papers declared that that was a very good,30
NA,"for Australia, but that it would have",30
NA,been even more beneficial i f the right hon-,30
NA,member for Cowper (Dr Earle,30
NA,"Page) had also been defeated, and both",30
NA,such gentlemen had proceeded to London. I,30
NA,"do not know whether it' would be possible,",30
NA,"at present, to make two appointments in",30
NA,but I am aware that that would,30
NA,meet with the approval of a large section,30
NA,out of the people of Australia.,30
NA,The right honorable member for,30
NA,emCowper seemed to have an intimate,30
NA,of the intention of the Govern-,30
NA,ment regarding the right honorable mem-,30
NA,"for Flinders, and i t did not surprise",30
NA,a me to hear him acclaim the appointment,30
NA,as a good one. Clause 4 of the High,31
NA,-Commissioner Act sets out-,31
NA,Thu High Commissioner shall-,31
NA,(o) act as representative and resident,31
NA,agent of the Commonwealth in the,31
NA,"United Kingdom, and in that",31
NA,capacity exercise such powers and,31
NA,perform such duties as are con-,31
NA,ferred upon and assigned to him by,31
NA,the Governor-General;,31
NA,(!)) carry out such instructions as he,31
NA,receives from the Minister respect-,31
NA,"ing the commercial, financial, aud",31
NA,general interests of the Common-,31
NA,wealth and the States in the United,31
NA,Kingdom and elsewhere.,31
NA,I should like to know from the Prime,31
NA,Minister ( Mr Lyons) whether this,31
NA,Resident Minister in London is to receive,31
NA,"instructions from "" the Minister"". I f",31
NA,"30, what Minister? Will it be from the",31
NA,Prime Minister as head of the Govern-,31
NA,"ment, or is the Right Honorable S. M .",31
NA,"Bruce to be the dominating personality,",31
NA,dictating the policy of the Government,31
NA,"from London? Many people, including",31
NA,the honorable member for Maribyrnong,31
NA,"( Mr Fenton), and even the Prime Minis-",31
NA,"ter himself, have said frequently that the",31
NA,right honorable member for Flinders is,31
NA,the man who dictated the policy of the,31
NA,"Nationalist Government, and in 1929",31
NA,those two gentlemen denounced him from,31
NA,every political platform from which they,31
NA,"spoke. To a great extent, those denun-",31
NA,ciations won their return to Parliament.,31
NA,"In the circumstances, it is not surprising",31
NA,that the right honorable gentleman should,31
NA,do everything to facilitate' the banish-,31
NA,ment of the right honorable member for,31
NA,"Flinders to London. Temporarily, at",31
NA,"least, he will be out of the way. Clause",31
NA,7 of the act reads-,31
NA,A person appointed to be the High Com-,31
NA,missioner shall not during his tenure of office,31
NA,be or act as director or agent of or hold any,31
NA,office in any company or syndicate whether,31
NA,incorporated or unincorporated or hold any,31
NA,"other employment, or engage in any business,",31
NA,whether within or without the Commonwealth.,31
NA,Will the Prime Minister explain whether,31
NA,that applies to the position of the Resident,31
NA,Minister in London? I waited in vain,31
NA,for the Attorney-General ( Mr Latham),31
NA,to give some cogent reason justifying this,31
NA,appointment. The honorable gentleman,31
NA,"stated that, after Mr Bruce returned, an",31
NA,appointment would be made for a period,31
NA,of five years. That indicates that a job,31
NA,i3 being created for a prominent ineniplay,31
NA,i f r . FonU.,31
NA,"ber of the Nationalist party, whose col-",31
NA,leagues desire to get rid of him for a,31
NA,while. Notwithstanding these times' of,31
NA,"distress, the Estimates reveal that this",31
NA,"year there is to be a 100 per cent, increase",31
NA,in the cost of the upkeep of the official,31
NA,residence in London. Is it that the resi-,31
NA,dence that was good enough for Sir Gran-,31
NA,ville Byrie is not good enough for the,31
NA,Bight Honorable S. M. Bruce?,31
Mr LYONS ,There is no such increase.,31
Mr FORDE ,A t page 33 of the Esti-,31
NA,mates it will be found that the estimated,31
NA,upkeep of the official residence in London,31
NA,for the year 1932-33 is £520 as against,31
NA,an expenditure of £243 in 1931-32.,31
Mr LYONS ,Th e honorable member,31
NA,refers to portion only of the total allow-,31
NA,v,31
NA,ance.,31
Mr FORDE ,Sectio n 5 of the High,31
NA,Commissioner Act is as follows:-,31
NA,"The High Commissioner, for tho purpose of",31
NA,more economically and effectively advancing,31
NA,the material interests and welfare of every,31
NA,"part of Australia, shall also, if the Governor-",31
NA,"General so directs, perform for the States",31
NA,functions and dutio3 similar to those herein-,31
NA,before described and similar to those now dis-,31
NA,charged by the Agents-General of the States.,31
NA,Has the Prime Minister had a conference,31
NA,with the State Premiers regarding the,31
NA,abolition of the positions of State Agents-,31
NA,Generals with a view to eliminating this,31
NA,"duplication ? I f so, the position of High",31
NA,Commissioner could be filled by an able,31
NA,"representative of the Commonwealth,",31
NA,who would perform the duties common,31
NA,to both offices. The Attorney-General,31
NA,"declared that, as a general principle, it",31
NA,would not be advisable to have a Resi-,31
NA,"dent Minister in London, and futilely",31
NA,endeavoured to justify the . action of,31
NA,the Government. I am of the opinion,31
NA,that the right honorable member for,31
NA,Flinders will still dominate the policy,31
NA,"of the Government from London, particu-",31
NA,larly insofar as finance is concerned.,31
NA,With all due respect to the right honor-,31
NA,"able gentleman, I submit that he has the",31
NA,outlook of an Englishman rather than,31
NA,that of an Australian.,31
NA,The Attorney-General also stated that,31
NA,there was much - to be done to improve,31
NA,our markets. Is it intended that the,31
NA,right honorable member for Flinders shall,31
NA,a leading part in seeking additional,31
NA,"markets for Australian products, or is he",31
NA,to confine himself to the duties of High,32
NA,Commissioner and to dictating the finan-,32
NA,cial policy of the Commonwealth? I have,32
NA,yet to read a report from Sir Granville,32
NA,"Ryrie, who was once a Minister in a",32
NA,"Nationalist Government, indicating that",32
NA,he did anything to open up bigger and,32
NA,better markets for Australian primary,32
NA,producers. Already we have in London,32
NA,representatives of the Commonwealth,32
NA,Marketing Board and the EmpireMarket-,32
NA,ing Board. Are they not performing their,32
NA,duties properly? Is it necessary to have,32
NA,this Besident Minister seeking bigger and,32
NA,better markets? I believe that to be,32
NA,merely another excuse to justify Mr.,32
NA,Bruce's appointment.,32
NA,I am disappointed that the Prime,32
NA,Minister could not say how long the right,32
NA,honorable member for Flinders will,32
NA,occupy the position of Besident Minister,32
NA,in London. We know that the bill pro-,32
NA,"vides for an appointment of two years,",32
NA,and when the project was first,32
NA,mooted the Prime Minister said that the,32
NA,appointment would be for twelve months.,32
NA,I t might be for six months or any other,32
NA,period. Surely the Government can be,32
NA,more precise.,32
NA,A great deal has been said about the,32
NA,qualifications of Mr Bruce for the posi-,32
NA,tion. Honorable members opposite have,32
NA,pointed to him as an outstanding figure,32
NA,who has done much for Australia. I,32
NA,remember listening to an eloquent speech,32
NA,by the right honorable member for Flin-,32
NA,ders when Prime Minister. I t was,32
NA,"delivered at Adelaide, and sought to",32
NA,justify the policy of his Government in,32
NA,"borrowing £40,000,000 a year to develop",32
NA,Australia by the importation of goods,32
NA,from abroad; for the natural corollary,32
NA,of borrowing from abroad is increased,32
NA,importations. That policy had a particu-,32
NA,larly disastrous effect upon our secondary,32
NA,industries. Yet the gentleman responsible,32
NA,for it is being honoured by appointment,32
NA,to the important position of Resident,32
NA,Minister in London! I t was claimed that,32
NA,Mr Bruce would not receive the full,32
NA,salary paid to a High Commissioner;,32
NA,that his allowance as Honorary Minis-,32
NA,ter would be deducted from that amount.,32
NA,I contend that i f the right honor-,32
NA,able gentleman can be spared from Aus-,32
NA,tralia for twelve months the position of,32
NA,"Honorary Minister, which he occupies,",32
NA,"could be abolished, with a resultant saving",32
NA,to tlie country.,32
NA,"I t has been claimed that, as Besident.",32
NA,"Minister in London, the right honorable",32
NA,member for Flinders will play a promi-,32
NA,nent part in the conversion of Australia's,32
NA,indebtedness. Surely that is a task for,32
NA,the Prime Minister-no t for an Honorary,32
NA,Minister. During the last federal elec-,32
NA,"tion campaign, the Prime Minister said",32
NA,"that, if elected, one of his first jobs would",32
NA,be to proceed to London to convert the,32
NA,whole of Australia's indebtedness at a,32
NA,reduced rate of interest. The right hon-,32
NA,orable gentleman has not done so.,32
NA,"Instead, he passes the task over to an",32
NA,Honorary Minister.,32
NA,Not one 'sound argument has been,32
NA,advanced by honorable members opposite,32
NA,in defence of the appointment.,32
NA,"Obviously, it is merely a subterfuge to",32
NA,find a position for the right honorable,32
NA,"member for Flinders, who unexpectedly",32
NA,"performed a political "" comeback ""-, and",32
NA,disconcerted his colleagues. I predict,32
NA,that in the next twelve months there will,32
NA,be considerable political intrigue with the,32
NA,object of removing certain honorable,32
NA,gentlemen from the treasury bench and,32
NA,placing the Government under different,32
NA,leadership.,32
Mr CASEY ,Corio) [4.57] -Whil e,32
NA,listening to the right honorable the,32
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin),32
NA,I found it difficult to think that he was,32
NA,"not speaking "" with his dialectic tongue",32
NA,"in his dialectic cheek"". I f anybody",32
NA,knows the difficulty of effecting the con-,32
NA,version of huge sums of money on the,32
NA,"London market, it is the right honorable",32
NA,"gentleman, for he made tentative attempts",32
NA,to do that when he was last in London.,32
NA,The right honorable gentleman com-,32
NA,menced by saying that he was not,32
NA,prepared to undermine the position,32
NA,"of Mr Bruce in London, and then",32
NA,immediately proceeded to do so. The,32
NA,right honorable gentleman and others,32
NA,who followed him questioned his judg-,32
NA,ment and claimed that Mr Collins could,32
NA,perform the task ahead of him equally,32
NA,well. That is more than open to question.,32
NA,I appreciate Mr Collins as a civil ser-,32
NA,"vant. I worked with him, and am his",32
NA,"friend. But I do not consider, and I",32
NA,am confident that the right honorable the,32
NA,Leader of the Opposition does not con-,33
NA,"sider,, that Mr Collins could conduct",33
NA,the preliminary negotiations for the con-,33
NA,version of our indebtedness in London.,33
NA,All with experience of such negotiations,33
NA,are aAvare that the more important the,33
NA,"negotiations, the more does success",33
NA,upon the personality and standing of the,33
NA,individual conducting them. I n spite of,33
NA,the splenetic invective of honorable mem-,33
NA,"bers who should know better, I believe",33
NA,"that they, and the people of Australia",33
NA,"generally, recognize the peculiar qualities",33
NA,that fit the Right Honorable S. M .,33
NA,Bruce for the task. Mr Collins could,33
NA,not even begin negotiations on equal,33
NA,terms with the Governor of the Bank of,33
NA,"England, or with the British Treasury,",33
NA,but the right honorable member for Flin-,33
NA,ders ( Mr Bruce) will be able to do so.,33
NA,I t has been asked in certain quarters,33
NA,what is the right honorable member's,33
NA,mission in London. I t is a simple one;,33
NA,the attempt to convert our loans from,33
NA,a. high to a lower rate of interest.,33
NA,of no one with better qualifications for,33
NA,the task. The first business to be under-,33
NA,taken is the conversion of the New South,33
NA,"Wales loan of £13,000,000 that falls due",33
NA,in November. I f that conversion suc-,33
NA,"ceeds, the conversion of the bracketed",33
NA,loans falling due within the next few,33
NA,years will remain to be undertaken.,33
NA,Mr Bruce's mission is to effect these,33
NA,"versions, so far as i t is humanly possible",33
NA,to do so; and then he will return to this,33
NA,"country. Details will, no doubt, be",33
NA,attended to by Mr Collins. Nobody sug-,33
NA,"- gests, for example, that Mr Bruce should",33
NA,remain to sign the new scrip to be issued.,33
NA,I do not think that the House or,33
NA,country will take much notice of the Opposition said.,33
NA,mean innuendoes of the honorable member,33
NA,for West Sydney ( Mr Beasley).,33
Mr STEWART ,"Th e Labor Daily will,",33
NA,perhaps.,33
Mr CASEY ,"-Th e Labor Daily, pernote",33
NA,"haps, will publish his photograph",33
NA,"report his remarks in full, emphasizing",33
NA,his bitterer remarks in black type.,33
NA,honorable member did not attack the,33
NA,vernment's proposal on its merits.,33
NA,Everything he said could be accounted,33
NA,"for by political spleen, and by the fact",33
NA,that he has had the unique experience,33
NA,this Parliament of being singled out,33
NA,the right honorable member for Flinders,33
NA,for rebuke. The remarks of the Deputy,33
NA,even Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde),33
NA,"were likewise, in my opinion, animated",33
NA,solely by political motives. The implica-,33
NA,tion was that Mr Bruce was intimately,33
NA,concerned with the business affairs of,33
NA,"depend Paterson, Laing and Bruce. That, I",33
NA,"think, even the Deputy Leader of the",33
NA,Opposition knows to be untrue. I n the,33
NA,"circumstances, the statement was mis-",33
NA,chievous and unfair. The measure has,33
NA,not been discussed by the Opposition on,33
NA,its merits; i t has been made the oppor-,33
NA,"tunity for backbiting, and for what the",33
NA,House will recognize as a mean and dirty,33
NA,attack,33
Mr SPEAKER ,Order !,33
Mr CASEY ,"Then , I will say, as an",33
NA,unjust attack on a man who is not here,33
NA,to defend himself.,33
NA,NA,33
NA,I do not think that I have ever listened,33
NA,to weaker opposition to any measure than,33
NA,I know the speeches on this occasion of the,33
NA,"Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin),",33
NA,"the Deputy Leader ( Mr Forde), and",33
NA,the leader of what has been called the,33
NA,Lang group ( Mr Beasley). Their argu-,33
NA,"ment, or lack - of argument, shows how",33
NA,difficult i t was for them to say something,33
NA,against the bill. The Leader of the,33
NA,Opposition began by saying that Mr.,33
NA,"conCollins, our financial adviser in London,",33
NA,had a more intimate knowledge of the,33
NA,details of our financial affairs than any,33
NA,"Minister could have, and, therefore,",33
NA,could do better than any Minister in,33
NA,making arrangements for the future.,33
Mr BLAKELEY ,Tha t is not an exact,33
NA,the repetition of what the Leader of the,33
NA,NA,33
NA,to be able to repeat his statement word,33
NA,"for word, but, at the time the right hon-",33
NA,"orable member was speaking, I made a",33
NA,to the effect that he said that Mr.,33
NA,and Collins had a more intimate knowledge,33
NA,of the details than any Minister going,33
NA,"The from here could hope to have, and could",33
NA,Godo better. I submit that it is not a mere,33
NA,knowledge of the details-althoug h I,33
NA,have a great respect for the knowledge of,33
NA,detail possessed by the right honorable,33
NA,in member for Flinders-bu t a. broad grasp,33
NA,by of Australia's position that is required,33
NA,by a Minister going to represent Australia,33
NA,overseas. Who would be the more,34
NA,powerful or more impressive advocate of,34
NA,"Australia, of her resources, of her",34
NA,honorable record for prompt payment,34
NA,"when so many countries have defaulted,",34
NA,of her capacity and determination to,34
NA,"stand up to her obligation- Mr Bruce,",34
NA,"or some Commonwealth public servant,",34
NA,"ao matter how able he might be, or how",34
NA,great the respect in which Ave hold him?,34
NA,"E do not believe, nor, I am sure, does Mr.",34
NA,"Collins himself, that our financial adviser",34
NA,in London could do the Avork required at,34
NA,the present time so satisfactorily as could,34
NA,a man with the standing of Mr Bruce.,34
NA,"We have already read something, par-",34
NA,ticularly in the financial press of,34
NA,"England, of the good effect produced in",34
NA,financial circles by the advocacy of Aus-,34
NA,tralia's interests by the Attorney-General,34
NA,( Mr Latham) Avhen he was recently in,34
NA,London. We have learned how he was,34
NA,able most effectively to dispose of certain,34
NA,ill-informed and groundless prejudices,34
NA,against Australia and her methods of,34
NA,finance. I believe that the right hon-,34
NA,orable member for Flinders will do this,34
NA,task as well as any man could. The Go-,34
NA,vernment could not make a better choice.,34
NA,"He is a well-known figure, he has an",34
NA,"international reputation, he has a per-",34
NA,"sonality which inspires confidence, and",34
NA,"he has many valuable contacts, both in",34
NA,the business world and with financial,34
NA,"institutions, which must be of in-",34
NA,calculable value to Australia Avhen we are,34
NA,seeking to convert large sums on the,34
NA,London market.,34
NA,The additional advantage of minis-,34
NA,terial authority which he will possess,34
NA,not be overlooked. The Deputy Leader,34
NA,of the Opposition said that Mr Bruce's,34
NA,position in London would be virtually a,34
NA,"sinecure. That, I think, is the best joke",34
NA,we have heard yet in connection with this,34
NA,proposal. The honorable member for,34
NA,West Sydney said that Mr Bruce had not,34
NA,"an Australian outlook, and this was re-",34
NA,peated by the Deputy Leader of the,34
NA,"Opposition. Well, I do not know that",34
NA,West Sydney has a monopoly of Aus-,34
NA,"tralian outlook, and certainly, within the",34
NA,"last nine months or so, the people of Aus-",34
NA,tralia have shoAvn that they do not regard,34
NA,the West Sydney outlook as the Aus-,34
NA,tralian outlook. This is demonstrated by,34
NA,the present personnel of this House.,34
NA,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition,34
NA,spoke of marketing arrangements over-,34
NA,"seas, and appears to think it absurd that",34
NA,MT. Bruce should be expected to do any-,34
NA,thing to advance Australia's trade in,34
NA,Great Britain. His argument reminded,34
NA,me of the very narroAv view held by some,34
NA,-members of certain trade unions that one,34
NA,"man must do only one thing; that, for in-",34
NA,"stance, a plumber must never touch any-",34
NA,thing which could be done by a carpenter.,34
NA,Surely i f a Minister goes to London it,34
NA,is not out of place for' him to do any-,34
NA,thing and everything to advance Aus-,34
NA,tralia's prospects and trade. There is no,34
NA,"need, even though his principal mission",34
NA,"be in regard to finance, to exclude rigidly",34
NA,everything else. We know that iu 1923 i t,34
NA,"Avas this same gentleman, the right",34
NA,"honorable member for Flinders, who did",34
NA,a great deal for a number of our,34
NA,important exporting industries by obtain-,34
NA,ing certain preferences from the British,34
NA,Government. Although their extent was,34
NA,"then limited, Australia obtained prefer-",34
NA,"ence for dried fruits, wines, and sugar,",34
NA,three concessions which were extremely,34
NA,"valuable to the people of Australia, and",34
NA,particularly to some of the constituents,34
NA,"of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition,",34
NA,Avho has been at such pains to belittle,34
NA,Mr Bruce.,34
NA,Some of the gibes of honorable mem-,34
NA,bers i n respect of the emoluments of the,34
NA,High Commissioner are very paltry.,34
NA,The Prime Minister has shown that there,34
NA,will be an actual saving as the result of,34
NA,"the neAv arrangement; but, even if .there",34
NA,"were not, when Ave consider the import-",34
NA,canance of the task which Mr Bruce is to,34
NA,"undertake, and the enormous benefits",34
NA,which will accrue to Australia i f he is,34
NA,"successful, we realize IIOAV petty are com-",34
NA,plaints about the salary of the Besident,34
NA,"Minister in London. Consider, for",34
NA,"instance, the first task which Mr.",34
NA,Bruce will undertake-th e conversion of,34
NA,"a loan of £13,000,000 for New South",34
NA,"Wales, which is falling due in ""NoAem- r",34
NA,"ber. I f i t were possiblefor Australia,",34
NA,owing to the efforts of a man of the,34
NA,"standing of Mr Bruce, to secure terms",34
NA,"only 2s. 6d. per cent, lower in the interest'",34
NA,"payable on the loan, it would mean a",34
NA,"saving of £16,000 a year. I do not",34
NA,"think i t would be expecting too much, or",34
NA,exaggerating the possibilities of the,34
NA,"situation, to say that Mr Bruce might",35
NA,- be able to obtain that additional advan-,35
NA,tage when another man could not. Then,35
NA,there i3 a larger conversion which it'might,35
NA,'he advantageous to undertake later. We,35
NA,were told by the Prime Minister in his,35
NA,"budget speech that, of the £474,000,000",35
NA,which we owed in Great Britain apart,35
NA,"from war debt, about £307,000,000 was",35
NA,"borrowed at 5 per cent, and over. No",35
NA,"less than £93,000,000 was at more",35
NA,"than 5 per cent., and up to 6£",35
NA,;.per cent. We were also reminded,35
NA,last week that we have current option,35
NA,"conversion rights over £96,000,000 worth",35
NA,"-of our overseas debt, on which we pay",35
NA,"5 per cent, and up to 6-J por cent,",35
NA,interest. There is nothing to prevent us,35
NA,from negotiating with the overseas bond-,35
NA,"holders at the present time, or at any",35
NA,"time we think fit, because the first of",35
NA,two maturity dates in connexion with,35
NA,these particular issues has already passed.,35
NA,I f Mr Bruce were able to obtain an,35
NA,"advantage of 2s. 6d. per cent, less interest",35
NA,"on £96,000,000 worth of debt, that alone",35
NA,"would represent a saving of £120,000 a",35
NA,year to Australia.,35
NA,The Government could not have made a,35
NA,"better choice for this position, and I",35
NA,support the bill.,35
Mr WHITE ,Balaclava) [5.12] -I t,35
NA,is hardly necessary to say anything in,35
NA,"support of this bill, because the appoint-",35
NA,ment of such a man as Mr Bruce is,35
NA,obviously a good one. He has peculiar,35
NA,"characteristics, he has travelled, he is",35
NA,"educated, and he is, above all",35
NA,"things, a gentleman, which one can-",35
NA,not say of some of the representatives,35
NA,of Australia who have been sent,35
NA,abroad in the past. I have risen chiefly,35
NA,because of the attacks made on Mr.,35
NA,Bruce by the honorable member for East.,35
NA,"Sydney ( Mr Ward), the honorable mem-",35
NA,ber for West Sydney ( Mr Beasley) and,35
NA,the Deputy Loader of the Opposition,35
NA,( Mr Forde). The Leader of the Oppo-,35
NA,sition ( Mr Scullin) said that Mr Bruce,35
NA,"had carried Australia to disaster, and",35
NA,treated the warnings of various persons-,35
NA,"himself included, I suppose-i n an airy",35
NA,"manner; and that, consequently, he",35
NA,was thrown from office in 1929.,35
NA,Honorable members know well that,35
NA,the main issue at that election was,35
NA,arbitration-th e removal of a great,35
NA,many petty industrial matters from,35
NA,the jurisdiction of the Common-,35
NA,wealth Arbitration Court to that of State,35
NA,tribunals. The Leader of the Opposition,35
NA,used all his oratory on that occasion to,35
NA,defeat the right honorable member for,35
NA,"Flinders ( Mr Bruce), stating that there",35
NA,"was no need to economize, no need to cut",35
NA,down the costs of industry by reforming,35
NA,the arbitration system. But what'did the,35
NA,Leader of the Opposition and his sup-,35
NA,porters do after they had brought about,35
NA,the fall of Mr Bruce and his Govern-,35
NA,ment? They found themselves up against,35
NA,"financial and economic problems, and",35
NA,were compelled to bring in wage reduction,35
NA,"bills, which cut the earnings of the",35
NA,Avorkers very substantially. Yet they,35
NA,have the audacity now to charge Mr.,35
NA,"Bruce with, having neglected his duty,",35
NA,"the when, they themselves were prepared to",35
NA,bribe the people by offering what they,35
NA,"could noi deliver. For six years, the",35
NA,right honorable member acquitted him-,35
NA,self honorably as leader of the Bruce-,35
NA,"Page Government, whose term of office",35
NA,was one of the most prosperous periods in,35
NA,Australia's history.,35
NA,The right honorable gentleman has,35
NA,been attacked to-day because it happens,35
NA,that his interests are not entirely politi-,35
NA,cal; but I claim that one of the greatest,35
NA,"curses in Australia, to-day is the profes-",35
NA,sional politician. Many honorable mem-,35
NA,bers on the other side of the House re-,35
NA,present that class. They have the gift of,35
NA,"the gab, and having acted as union secre-",35
NA,"taries, often through being indifferent",35
NA,"tradesmen, they are regarded as suitable",35
NA,candidates for parliamentary honours.,35
NA,These men have to do-as they are told;,35
NA,yet they pose in this Parliament as the,35
NA,representatives of a democratic move-,35
NA,ment. The man who has been criticized,35
NA,in this House to-day has shown his,35
NA,ability in other than political walks of,35
NA,life. In reply to the gibe that he does,35
NA,not know this country so well as some,35
NA,"petty-minded Australians do, I point out",35
NA,that the fact that he went abroad for,35
NA,"some of his education stands to his credit,",35
NA,rather than to his detriment. He spent,35
NA,several years in doing his part during a,35
NA,"national crisis, while certain other hon-",35
NA,orable members seemed not to remember,35
NA,"to do so. That, too, may be said to the",35
NA,credit of the right honorable member.,35
NA,The honorable member for West Sydney,36
NA,( Mr Beasley) remarked that when the,36
NA,right honorable member was defeated in,36
NA,"Flinders, ho left. Australia, and took no",36
NA,part in assisting to get this country out,36
NA,of its difficulties. I am in a position to,36
NA,state that he could then have had a safe,36
NA,"seat in this Parliament, had he chosen to",36
NA,take it. I accidentally met him when he,36
NA,knew that the figures in his own elec-,36
NA,torate were against him. On that occa-,36
NA,"sion, I had been a member of this House",36
NA,for only three or four weeks and had suc-,36
NA,"cessfully faced a second election, but in",36
NA,view of the attack made upon Mr Bruce,36
NA,"by honorable members opposite, I make""",36
NA,no apology for saying that I offered to,36
NA,resign i f he cared to take my seat in,36
NA,Balaclava.,36
Mr GANDER ,Anothe r dummy!,36
Mr WHITE , I know that the honor-,36
NA,able member for Beid ( Mr Gander) is,36
NA,a seat-warmer for the ex-Premier of New,36
NA,"South Wales, but, as I have pointed out,",36
NA,when I made that offer I had heen a,36
NA,"member for only a few weeks, and I",36
NA,realized that it was a tragedy for the,36
NA,services of a man of the calibre of Mr.,36
NA,Bruce to be lost to Australia. The right,36
NA,honorable gentleman said that he was,36
NA,"going on a holiday, but he promised that",36
NA,"when he returned from Great Britain, he",36
NA,"would fight for his old seat, and win it",36
NA,back. The honorable member for Mel-,36
NA,"bourne Ports ( Mr Holloway), who left",36
NA,"the Blinders seat for a safer electorate,",36
NA,can tell us whether the right honorable,36
NA,member for Flinders carried out that,36
NA,promise. The 'honorable member for,36
NA,West Sydney remarked that Mr Willis,36
NA,had complained that the United Australia,36
NA,"party had "" cruelled the pitch "" for him,",36
NA,because it refused to i>e a party to repu-,36
NA,"diation of overseas interest payments, and",36
NA,that he could have secured lower interest,36
NA,rates overseas i f the Lang policy had,36
NA,been adopted. The honorable member,36
NA,for West Sydney preferred an importa-,36
NA,tion of the type of Mr Willis to an honest,36
NA,and. influential man like Mr Bruce.,36
Mr GANDER ,Doe s not the honorable,36
NA,member believe in importation?.,36
Mr WHITE ,W e could well do with,36
NA,"the exportation of some of the "" reds""",36
NA,and their associates.,36
NA,I regret that a most worthy member,36
NA,of this House has been unfairly criticized.,36
NA,[10 ],36
NA,The international situation is most com-,36
NA,plex. Affairs in Germany have come to,36
NA,such a pass that there may be civil war,36
NA,"in that country, and Bussia is mysterious",36
NA,and menacing. Honorable members,36
NA,"opposite address each other as comrades,",36
NA,and profess to believe in tbe brotherhood,36
NA,"of man, but in the arena of domestic",36
NA,"politics, they fight bitterly between them-",36
NA,"selves. Paradoxically, they favour a",36
NA,"high tariff, which makes a country",36
NA,"selfishly national, and is often the cause",36
NA,of international disputes. The party,36
NA,"opposite is alive only to the petty, local",36
NA,"interests of Australia, but we are fortu-",36
NA,"nate in having, in Mr Bruce, a man who",36
NA,sees affairs in their imperial and interna-,36
NA,tional aspects. I support the bill.,36
Mr BLAKELEY ,Darling) [5.21] - 1,36
NA,oppose this measure. I do not say that,36
NA,my opposition to i t would have dis-,36
NA,appeared i f the Prime Minister ( Mr.,36
NA,"Lyons), the Attorney-General ( Mr.",36
NA,"Latham), and several of those support-",36
NA,ing the bill had been more frank in ex-,36
NA,plaining the supposed necessity for it .,36
NA,Its real object seems to be shrouded in,36
NA,"mystery. Apparently, no good reason can",36
NA,be advanced for clothing the Besident,36
NA,Minister in London with the powers of,36
NA,the High Commissioner. As a matter of,36
NA,"fact, under present conditions it is not",36
NA,necessary to have a High Commissioner,36
NA,in London at all. Mr J. B. Collins has,36
NA,practically carried out the work of that,36
NA,officer for many years. Judging by the,36
NA,powers proposed to be given to the right,36
NA,honorable member for Flinders ( Mr.,36
NA,"Bruce), under this more or less spectacu-",36
NA,"lar measure, it would seem that the House",36
NA,has not been informed of the real reason,36
NA,for the bill.,36
NA,I do not intend to make a personal,36
NA,"attack on Mr Bruce in his absence, but",36
NA,"I am entitled, I think, to offer criticism",36
NA,of a political nature. The injurious,36
NA,effect on Australia of the administration,36
NA,of the Bruce-Page Government is still,36
NA,"remembered, and, unfortunately, this",36
NA,"country, will for many years have",36
NA,to bear the burden which that,36
NA,Government imposed upon it.. I l,36
NA,"had an un-Australian outlook, for",36
NA,it adopted a policy of borrowing,36
NA,and buying abroad. Our secondary,36
NA,industries and our finances were crippled,36
NA,"during its regime. When, in 1929, i t",36
NA,"ignoniiniously went out of office, it was",37
NA,generally regarded as a Ministry which,37
NA,had administered the finances of this,37
NA,"country unwisely. . During thisdebate,",37
NA,many encomiums have been heaped upon,37
NA,the right honorable member for Flinders.,37
NA,One can readily find a reason for that.,37
NA,"When 'he Comes back, in all probability",37
NA,"he will be in a' position to reward, those",37
NA,who have defended him in his absence,37
NA,from the charges levelled against him as,37
NA,a public financier. One Can appreciate,37
NA,the desire of certain honorable members,37
NA,to stand in well with a man who will,37
NA,probably occupy a high position in this,37
NA,country before the expiration of the,37
NA,twelve months for which he is to be,37
NA,appointed Besident Minister in London.,37
NA,"His first duty, it seems to me, is to re-",37
NA,habilitate himself in the eyes of the people,37
NA,"of Australia, and that will be a difficult",37
NA,job. Much has be6n said to-day of,37
NA,"his capacity as an administrator, but I",37
NA,claim that during his term of office as,37
NA,Prime Minister he showed blundering in-,37
NA,capacityj and a total disregard for the,37
NA,Welfare of Australian industries. There,37
NA,was lavish expenditure during his regime;,37
NA,"public money was wasted,- and from ten",37
NA,to fifteen years will be required to enable,37
NA,the Commonwealth to recover from,37
NA,the bankrupt condition in which he,37
NA,left it. This is the man who is held,37
NA,up to-day as the only person suit-,37
NA,able for the special mission on which he,37
NA,has been sent to London. As a matter of,37
NA,"fact, the job for which he is ostensibly",37
NA,"going there, has already been done.",37
NA,What I am afraid of is that the right,37
NA,"honorable member, with his kindly regard",37
NA,for the overseas financiers and the bond-,37
NA,"holders, will not strike such a bargain",37
NA,for Australia as could be obtained by a,37
NA,representative other than himself.,37
NA,"my opinion, he has neither the necessary",37
NA,"capacity, nor the temperament required",37
NA,to enable him to carry out delicate,37
NA,financial negotiations. The right honor-,37
NA,able member has not an Australian out-,37
NA,look. I speak as the result of about,37
NA,ten years' experience of him in the public,37
NA,"life of this country, and that is also the",37
NA,conclusion which many thousands of,37
NA,people in Australia have reached,37
NA,ing him. Owing to his mismanagement,37
NA,"of the finances of the Commonweal th,",37
NA,cannot accept him as the plenipotentiary,37
NA,Mr lilakeleu.,37
NA,"of Australia. No doubt, the Government",37
NA,thinks that i t is doing right in selecting,37
NA,"the right honorable member for this work,",37
NA,but the Opposition is entitled to protest,37
NA,against his selection to carry out the con-,37
NA,version of Australia's' overseas loans. I f,37
NA,the main reason for the appointment of,37
NA,the right honorable gentleman to this,37
NA,high position is not his personal rehabili-,37
NA,tation in the eyes of the Australian,37
NA,"people, one wonders-an d I regret that",37
NA,the Prime Minister' was not more frank-,37
NA,for whom the right honorable gentleman,37
NA,"is- "" seat-warming "" in Flinders. Some",37
NA,"talk has been indulged in about ""seat-",37
NA,"warming "" this afternoon. Why did not",37
NA,the honorable member for Balaclava ( Mr.,37
NA,White) enlighten the House on this,37
NA,matter? I have no doubt that the right,37
NA,honorable member for Flinders is very,37
NA,happy in' his new position. A ll his,37
NA,"business interests, or at least the greatei",37
NA,"part of them, lie in London, and they",37
NA,have caused him great concern in the last,37
NA,couple of years; in fact he had to hurry,37
NA,to London some time ago to take over a,37
NA,more or less staggering concern.,37
Mr WHITE ,Th e honorable member,37
NA,promised not to be personal.,37
Mr BLAKELEY ,M y criticism is,37
NA,not personal; I am merely reminding,37
NA,honorable members of something,37
NA,which the right honorable member,37
NA,himself said in this House. It,37
NA,is common knowledge that the firm,37
NA,"of Paterson, Laing and Bruce has suffered",37
NA,heavy losses during the last two years; in,37
NA,"one year the loss was £80,000. No doubt",37
NA,the public duties of the right honorable,37
NA,member for Flinders will dovetail very,37
NA,happily with attention to his private,37
NA,interests abroad. Those who are for ever,37
NA,gibing at professional politicians will,37
NA,approve of the appointment of the right,37
NA,In honorable gentleman as representative of,37
NA,Australia in London. Contemptuous,37
NA,reference is made to those men whose only,37
NA,source of livelihood is their parliamen-,37
NA,tary allowance. God help Australia i f,37
NA,it should ever become dependent on men,37
NA,who subordinate their parliamentary,37
NA,duties to their private business interests.,37
NA,Mr E. J. HAKBISON -Unio n organizer?,37
NA,regardwould be much better!,37
Mr BLAKELEY ,I n suits are hurled,37
NA,I at union secretaries. I n what respect,37
NA,"is, say, the manager of a shirt and",37
NA,pyjaraa factory better qualified for public,38
NA,life than a union secretary?,38
NA,NA,38
NA,was one of the much abused political,38
NA,"organizers, not a trade union organizer-",38
NA,God forbid!-bu t something much more,38
NA,. respectable.,38
Mr SPEAKER,Order ! I ask the,38
NA,honorable member to connect his remarks,38
NA,with the bill.,38
Mr BLAKELEY ,Australi a could be,38
NA,represented in London as well by a union,38
NA,secretary as by the director of an import-,38
NA,"ing firm, and with all due respect to high",38
NA,"finance and big business, I believe the",38
NA,former would do the job more efficiently.,38
NA,There is no need to alter the law to enable,38
NA,the right honorable member for Flinders,38
NA,to be appointed to represent Australia in,38
NA,"London, and there is certainly no justifi-",38
NA,cation for paying him more than his,38
NA,ministerial salary. He will control a,38
NA,"capable staff in Australia House, and I",38
NA,have no doubt that after the preliminary,38
NA,negotiations are completed the detail work,38
NA,of loan conversion will be done by men,38
NA,who understand these matters much better,38
NA,than the right honorable member for,38
NA,Flinders.,38
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,Tha t,38
NA,the ordinary course of business.,38
Mr BLAKELEY ,Th e Leader of the,38
NA,Opposition said that the conversion,38
NA,negotiations would be conducted up to a,38
NA,certain point by the Minister now in,38
NA,"London, but that the detail work could",38
NA,"be done by Mr Collins, who has a more",38
NA,intimate knowledge of public finance and,38
NA,loan operations than has the right hon-,38
NA,"orable member for Flinders, or any other",38
NA,person who is not constantly in touch,38
NA,with the financiers of London.,38
NA,"contention was completely misrepresented,",38
NA,"inadvertently I believe, by the honorable",38
NA,NA,38
NA,The explanation of this measure by the,38
NA,Prime Minister was not frank; possibly,38
NA,he thought that the time was not oppor-,38
NA,tune to take the House into his confidence.,38
NA,The Attorney-General ( Mr Latham) also,38
NA,showed a keen desire to withhold from,38
NA,the House the real reason for the step,38
NA,that is proposed. Other honorable mem-,38
NA,bers supporting the Government do not,38
NA,"know the real reason, but accept the",38
NA,ostensible one in the hope that their,38
NA,encomiums of the right honorable member,38
NA,for Flinders and their defence of his,38
NA,The political reputation will be suitably,38
NA,recognized on his return.,38
Mr GABB ,Angas) [5.36] -Th e,38
NA,debate seems to have centred on the right,38
NA,honorable member for Flinders ( Mr.,38
NA,"Bruce), but I do not find in the bill any",38
NA,"reference to him, although we .know that",38
NA,he is to be appointed acting High Com-,38
NA,missioner. I have arrived at the con-,38
NA,clusion that it is immaterial whether one,38
NA,votes for or against the bilL The Leader,38
NA,of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) has,38
NA,asserted that a vote for the second read-,38
NA,ing will be an endorsement of a new,38
NA,"system. The Attorney-General, on the",38
NA,"other hand, assured the House that the",38
NA,bill does not introduce any new general,38
NA,principle. Perhaps the Leader of tbe,38
NA,"Opposition is right, but governments will",38
NA,"please themselves, as they have done in",38
NA,the past. The operation of the bill is,38
NA,"limited to two years, but i f a government",38
NA,desires to send some of its members,38
NA,"abroad, i t will find excuses.for doing so.",38
NA,"For a considerable time, at least one Com-",38
NA,monwealth Minister of the Crown has,38
NA,been absent from Australia. The Scullin,38
NA,Ministry sent four Ministers abroad. To,38
NA,"date, the present Government has sent",38
NA,"is three abroad, and I doubt that that will",38
NA,be the end of these trips. I regard many,38
NA,"of them as merely political plums,",38
NA,and I am certain that i f the present Go-,38
NA,vernment or any future Government,38
NA,wants to send other Ministers on trips,38
NA,"at the public expense, it will do so,",38
NA,"whether this bill be accepted or"" rejected.",38
NA,I support the measure for two reasons.,38
NA,The first is that i t will enable a saving,38
NA,"of £2,000 a year to be effected.",38
Mr JAMES ,Ho w does the honorable,38
NA,member arrive at that figure?,38
Mr GABB ,Accordin g to the Prime,38
NA,"Minister, the ministerial allowance of the",38
NA,Minister resident in Loudon will be aug-,38
NA,mented by an amount sufficient to bring,38
NA,it up to the salary and allowances usually,38
NA,paid to the High Commissioner. I esti-,38
NA,mate that this will mean a saving of be-,38
NA,"tween £1,700 and £2,000. I am not con-",38
NA,vinced that the calibre of the representa-,38
NA,tion in London will be improved. The,38
NA,High Commissioner has always been an,38
NA,"<;x-Minister of, the Crown, and whether",38
NA,the occupant of the office be a Minister in,38
NA,harness or a Minister out of harness is,38
NA,immaterial. My second reason for sup-,39
NA,porting the bill is that governments will,39
NA,find it less easy to send another Minister,39
NA,tripping to London when there is already,39
NA,one resident there. This will mean a,39
NA,further saving. I was interested and,39
NA,amused by the Attorney-General's em-,39
NA,phasis of the need for efficient representa-,39
NA,tion of Australia in London. Undoubtedly,39
NA,"the need exists, but I could not help re-",39
NA,calling some earlier appointments of High,39
NA,Commissioners and Agents-General. I f,39
NA,"rumour be correct, Sir Granville Ryrie",39
NA,was appointed High Commissioner be-,39
NA,"cause of his political services to his party,",39
NA,and to get him out of the way at a time,39
NA,when his vote was uncertain. Sir Henry,39
NA,Barwell was appointed Agent-General for,39
NA,South Australia purely for political,39
NA,"reasons. Had he stood for the Senate,",39
NA,"he might, have prejudiced the chances of",39
NA,the Nationalist or Liberal candidates.,39
NA,"Therefore, the salary of the Agent-",39
NA,"General was increased, and Sir Henry",39
NA,Barwell was shipped to London. Happen-,39
NA,ings of this character make me feel that,39
NA,ability and efficiency arc not the factors,39
NA,which govern these appointments abroad ;,39
NA,the primary consideration is the interest,39
NA,of the political party iu power. This de-,39
NA,bate is another illustration of how politi-,39
NA,cal parties throw dust in the eyes of the,39
NA,"people, and continue their party wrangles",39
NA,regardless of what happens to the country.,39
Mr JAMES ,Hunter) [5.42] - I am,39
NA,opposed to tbe appointment of the right,39
NA,honorable member for Flinders,39
NA,Bruce) to be Resident Minister in London.,39
NA,Some honorable members have lauded the,39
NA,special qualifications of the right honorNew South Wales?,39
NA,"able gentleman, but I claim that the",39
NA,Bruce-Page Administration was largely,39
NA,responsible for the present financial,39
NA,"tion of Australia. That Ministry intro20,000",39
NA,duced thousands of migrants from overcould,39
NA,seas.,39
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! Some honorFlinders,39
NA,able members seem to be under the fications,39
NA,erroneous impression that they are parister,39
NA,ticipating in a debate on the budget.,39
NA,The bill before the House is for the,39
NA,pose of vesting in the Minister without,39
NA,"Portfolio, who is now in Great Britain,",39
NA,the powers given to 'the 'High Commisdesignation,39
NA,"sioner by the High Commissioner Act,",39
NA,which it amends. I ask the honorable,39
NA,member for Hunter to confine his reinarkt,39
NA,to the subject-matter of the bill.,39
Mr JAMES ,"Unfortunately , I al-",39
NA,ways seem to be the member reproved by,39
NA,the Chair for transgressing. Other hon-,39
NA,orable members have spoken of the special,39
NA,qualifications of the right honorable mem-,39
NA,"ber for Flinders, and surely I am entitled",39
NA,to answer them. The Bruce-Page Minis-,39
NA,"try introduced approximately 160,000",39
NA,"migrants at a cost of £2,000,000.",39
Mr HUTCHIN ,Th e migrants were in-,39
NA,troduced by the State Governments.,39
Mr JAMES ,Th e Bruce-Page Minis-,39
NA,"try expended £2,000,000 on the steamship",39
NA,passages of assisted migrants. During the,39
NA,time that the right honorable inembei,39
NA,"was Prime Minister £300,000 a year was",39
NA,expended on immigration. To-day the,39
NA,community generally has to maintain a,39
NA,considerable number of migrants who,39
NA,could not bo absorbed in industry. They,39
NA,were brought here for a specific purpose.,39
Mr SPEAKER , I cannot alloy,39
NA,the honorable member to enlarge hie,39
NA,argument on that subject. I f he wishes,39
NA,to bring outside matters into the debate,39
NA,he must do so by way of illustration and,39
NA,by directly connecting them with the,39
NA,subject-matter of the bill.,39
NA,7,39
Mr JAMES , I am pointing out thai,39
NA,because of the stupid blunder of a former,39
NA,Prime Minister this country is in the,39
NA,throes of a financial depression. Immi-,39
NA,grants were brought to Australia to swell,39
NA,the unemployed army in preparation for,39
NA,the grand attack of the moneyed interests,39
NA,( Mr on the workers of this country.,39
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,Di d not the,39
NA,"Lang Government bring 1,500 miners into",39
Mr JAMES ,Th e Bruce-Page Go-,39
NA,posivernment brought into Australia about,39
NA,"Southern Europeans, people who",39
NA,not even talk our language. The,39
NA,supporters of the Government have,39
NA,lauded the right honorable member for,39
NA,because of his particular quali-,39
NA,for the position of Resident Min-,39
NA,in London. But I contend that this,39
NA,position has been created for the right,39
NA,"purhonorable member, because he cannot bear",39
NA,the indignity of the leadership of the,39
NA,"present Prime Minister, and his present",39
NA,of Minister without portfolio.,39
NA,The supporters of the Government have,39
NA,eulogized the right honorable member as,39
NA,a true Australian. He may be Australian,40
NA,"born, but he certainly lacks an Australian",40
NA,outlook. He was not educated i n this,40
NA,"country, and he has spent much of his",40
NA,time out of i t . Durin g the war i t was,40
NA,beneath his dignity to enlist in the Aus-,40
NA,tralian army; so he joined a British regi-,40
NA,ment.,40
NA,Mr MCNICOT.T. -T o what regiment did,40
NA,the honorable member belong?,40
Mr JAMES ," I fought in the induswould,",40
NA,trial army on behalf of the workers and,40
NA,not of the wealthy interests. According,40
NA,to the honorable member fo r Balaclava,40
NA,"( Mr White), the right honorable member",40
NA,for Flinders ( Mr Bruce) has done much,40
NA,"for the exporting industry of this country,",40
NA,but I contend that his work at the Ottawa,40
NA,Conference has done much for the im -,40
NA,porting interests. We are now assured,40
NA,that our policy of tariff protection for,40
NA,Australian industries is to be practically,40
NA,"scrapped, and that our manuf acturers will",40
NA,have to face the competition of cheap,40
NA,labour countries. Our secondary indusber,40
NA,tries have been built up under a policy,40
NA,of protection so as to develop this country,40
NA,on national lines. We wish.to be an indewhich,40
NA,"pendent nation, capable of manufacturing",40
NA,our own raw materials and of competing,40
NA,with the finished article overseas. As a,40
NA,result of the efforts of the right honorable,40
NA,member for Flinders at the Ottawa Conmember,40
NA,ference we are to be -the wood and water,40
NA,joeys fo r other countries. We are to,40
NA,vide the raw materials for overseas,40
NA,"facturers, and our secondary industries",40
NA,must languish in consequence. I t has,40
NA,"said that the right honorable member,",40
NA,"while i n London, will confine most of his constantly changing.",40
NA,activities to the conversion of loans.,40
NA,"is no necessity for us to appoint a ResiAfter the next election,",40
NA,dent Minister to carry out that work. On members,40
NA,Monday night last I listened with a great,40
NA,"deal of interest to Mr A . C. Willis, the",40
NA,"late Agent-General fo r New South Wales,",40
NA,who has recently returned from Great,40
NA,"Britain . While in London Mr Willis,",40
NA,"at the instigation of Mr Lang, then",40
NA,"mier of New South Wales, approached a",40
NA,number of English brokers and bondwhoever,40
NA,holders. They stated that they were prevour,40
NA,pared to convert the loans of New South,40
NA,Wales at a reasonable interest rate;,40
NA,and had i t not been fo r the interwho,40
NA,"ference of the Federal Government, pension",40
NA,some satisfactory arrangement would,40
NA,have beeu made. When Mr Willis,40
NA,"had"" practically completed his negotiations",40
NA,a statement appeared in the British press,40
NA,to the effect that the Federal Government,40
NA,would pay its debt in f u l l . That state-,40
NA,ment cut the ground from under the feet,40
NA,of Mr Willis in his efforts to bring,40
NA,"about a reduction iu interest rates, and",40
NA,it was to discredit that gentleman and to,40
NA,n u l l i fy his efforts that the Federal. Go-,40
NA,"vernment stated that Australia could, aud",40
NA,meet its overseas obligations. Aus-,40
NA,tralia has met its obligations only at the,40
NA,expense of the community. Many of the,40
NA,"unemployed have had to starve, and now",40
NA,a further burden is being placed upon,40
NA,the old-age and invalid pensioners so that,40
NA,Australia may meet its commitments over-,40
NA,seas. I see no reason for a change in our,40
NA,representation in Great Britain . This is,40
NA,the first time in the long period during,40
NA,which the Commonwealth has had a H i g h,40
NA,Commissioner in London that i t has been,40
NA,proposed to put a Resident Minister into,40
NA,the position. The right honorable mem-,40
NA,for Flinders has commercial i n -,40
NA,"terests, not only in Australia, but",40
NA,also in Great Britain . The firm w i th,40
NA,he is connected is in financial diffi-,40
NA,"culties, and because of that he has had",40
NA,to make frequent trips to London.,40
Mr SPEAKER , 1 ask the honorable,40
NA,to confine his remarks to the bill.,40
Mr JAMES ,Ther e is no need to rush,40
NA,prothis measure through the House. The,40
NA,manuright honorable* member for N o r t h,40
NA,Sydney ( Mr Hughes) has frequently,40
NA,"been stated, in connexion with proposed",40
NA,"political changes, that governments are",40
NA,This Government,40
NA,There is occupying its position temporarily.,40
NA,honorable,40
NA,now on that side of,40
NA,the House will be members of the Opposi-,40
NA,"tion, and it is quite likely that the Govern-",40
NA,ment of the day w i l l take advantage of,40
NA,this legislation to appoint one of its,40
NA,adherents to the position of Resident M i n -,40
NA,Preister i n London. I urge the Government,40
NA,"to insist on our representative iu London,",40
NA,"he may be, using every endea-",40
NA,to bring about a reciprocal pensions .,40
NA,arrangement between Great B r i t a in and,40
NA,Australia. The parents of many families,40
NA,migrate here are debarred f r o m a,40
NA,because of not having fulfilled the,40
NA,"residential qualification. Yet, in many",40
NA,"instances, they have worked for long",41
NA,periods in industrial activities in Eng-,41
NA,land. British military pensions are pay-,41
NA,"able in this country, and there should be",41
NA,a similar reciprocal arrangement between,41
NA,Great Britain and Australia in regard to,41
NA,old-age and invalid pensions. I t is unfair,41
NA,for this Government to send the right,41
NA,honorable member for Blinders fo Great,41
NA,Britain to act as our representative there.,41
NA,He has been elected to this Parliament,41
NA,as the representative of the people of the,41
NA,"electorate of Blinders, and lie should not",41
NA,be allowed to neglect them.'According to,41
NA,"the press, in his absence, his electorate i3",41
NA,to be nursed by the honorable member,41
NA,for Bendigo ( Mr E. F. Harrison). I t,41
NA,"is a shame that this,Government should",41
NA,be prepared to send overseas a member,41
NA,of this House who has commercial in-,41
NA,"terests there, and who will exploit them",41
NA,to the detriment of tbe manufacturers of,41
NA,this country.,41
Dr MALONEY ,Melbourne) [6.0] -,41
NA,"This measure is .intituled "" A bill to",41
NA,amend the High Commissioner Act,41
NA,"1909 "". I accept the statement of the",41
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Lyons) that if i t,41
NA,"is agreed to, a considerable sum will be",41
NA,saved. I only regret that an attempt is,41
NA,"not being, made to save still more. I",41
NA,have known every High Commissioner,41
NA,for Australia. I was in London when,41
NA,sites for Australia House were being,41
NA,inspected. One site offered faced Trafal-,41
NA,gar Square. I t had a wide frontage but a,41
NA,"shallow depth. My old friend, Sir George",41
NA,"Reid, observed concerning it, "" Too much",41
NA,"face, and too little belly to build Australia",41
NA,"House on"". Subsequently, the present",41
NA,site was chosen. Sir George Reid was the,41
NA,"first High Commissioner, and a very good",41
NA,one he was. Next came Mr Andrew,41
NA,"Fisher; then Sir Joseph Cook, and then",41
NA,Sir Granville Ryrie. I t will be noticed,41
NA,"that all the occupants of this position,",41
NA,"except Andrew Fisher, were decorated",41
NA,with the tuppeny-ha'penny tin-pot thing,41
NA,termed a title. Only Andrew Fisher,41
NA,was plain Mister. But he dis-,41
NA,charged his duties as well,41
NA,any other occupant of the office. I like Sir,41
NA,"Granville Byrie, because he is a plain,",41
NA,blunt man who speaks from his heart.,41
NA,He said when he was appointed that he,41
NA,did not know why the honour had been,41
NA,"conferred upon him, and added that he",41
NA,would do his level best. He certainly,41
NA,made friends in South Africa when he,41
NA,told the Boers that they were brave men,41
NA,who had fought a desperate fight for free-,41
NA,dom.,41
NA,"I oppose this bill. I t is an infamy, in",41
NA,"present circumstances, to inflict upon the",41
NA,great Australian public the heavy expense,41
NA,which this office involves. I n answer to,41
NA,a question which I asked in this House,41
NA,"on the 20th September, 1928, I was told",41
NA,"that up to the 30th June, 1928, the build-",41
NA,"ing had cost £621,700, and that the site",41
NA,"had cost £379,800, making, in all,",41
NA,"£1,001,500. The administrative costs",41
NA,"then were £720,602.",41
Mr GIBSON ,Wha t is the present value,41
NA,of Australia House?,41
Dr MALONEY ,Ther e has been con-,41
NA,siderable depreciation in real estate in,41
NA,London as elsewhere. I made an inquiry,41
NA,"on that very point, and the reply I",41
NA,received was as follows:-,41
NA,Tho High Commissioner's office advises that,41
NA,it is practically impossible to estimate the,41
NA,value of the building and site but that there,41
NA,is no doubt that both would show a consider-,41
NA,able increase on the cost.,41
NA,We know very well that in consequence,41
NA,of the high taxation in England many,41
NA,"aristocratic homes have been sold. Still,",41
NA,"I do not think we would lose much, if",41
NA,"anything, if we were to sell Australia",41
NA,House even now. We have all heard,41
NA,"the old adage that promises, like",41
NA,"pie-crusts, are made to be broken,",41
NA,and another equally common saying,41
NA,that the path to hell is paved with good,41
NA,intentions. I t will be remembered that,41
NA,just before the consummation of federa-,41
NA,"tion, when we were discussing, on the",41
NA,"public platforms of this country, the bene-",41
NA,fits that would flow to Australia i f the,41
NA,"colonies federated, it was often said that",41
NA,one result of federation would mean that,41
NA,we should be able to do with one agent-,41
NA,general for the Commonwealth and the,41
NA,"States, whereas then six were needed,",41
NA,one for each State. I t was actually,41
NA,as promised that we should have only one,41
NA,"agent-general, but the promise was uot",41
NA,fulfilled. A l l the States still have their,41
NA,own agents-general.,41
NA,"Mr AacHDALB PAKKHILI, -Oh , no!",41
NA,"New South Wales has abolished the office,'",41
NA,and so has Tasmania.,41
Dr MALONEY ,"Well , we still have",42
NA,four agents-general too many. I believe,42
NA,that i f the people of Australia were con-,42
NA,sulted by ballot.they would indicate by,42
NA,an overwhelming majority that the office,42
NA,of State agent-general should be abol-,42
NA,ished in every case.,42
NA,In reply to my inquiry as to the num-,42
NA,ber of persons employed at Australia,42
NA,"House, I obtained the following figures:-",42
NA,"Temporary, 313 j permanent, 29; total",42
NA,342. I was also informed that only 58,42
NA,of these were Australians. I have no,42
NA,objection to British people. My mother,42
NA,"was an English woman, and I love the",42
NA,land from which she came. But I think,42
NA,more Australians should be employed at,42
NA,Australia House. Whenever the British,42
NA,Government establishes an office of any,42
NA,kind in Australia the largest percentage,42
NA,of the staff is English. I ascertained,42
NA,when I asked the series of questions to,42
NA,"which I have already referred, that 100",42
NA,typists were employed at Australia House.,42
NA,They were described as clerks and typists.,42
NA,"In this Parliament House, which is the",42
NA,"home of the Commonwealth Government,",42
NA,"and in which all our laws are made, we",42
NA,"have only fourteen typists. Why then,",42
NA,should there be 100 at Australia House?,42
NA,NA,42
NA,"man, the former member for Beid,",42
NA,made a valuable report on the expenditure,42
NA,"at Australia House, and recommended",42
NA,many economies; but I think the office,42
NA,should be closed and the building sold.,42
NA,I f that were done an end would be put,42
NA,to a lot of humbug and nonsense. I n these,42
NA,clays it would be possible for us to have,42
NA,a representative in London in a modest,42
NA,"office, and the members of the Govern-",42
NA,"ment could, i f they so desired, talk to him",42
NA,by telephone almost as easily as they can,42
NA,talk by telephone to officers at Civic,42
NA,Centre. There is no need for us to con-,42
NA,tinue spending large sums of money on,42
NA,this office. I believe we should do better,42
NA,from a commercial point of view i f we,42
NA,empowered the Government to grant tra-,42
NA,velling expenses to bona fide commercial,42
NA,travellers sent to England to represent,42
NA,specific interests. Arrangements might,42
NA,possibly be made for such persons to be,42
NA,allowed a certain percentage on the,42
NA,increased sales pf Australian products in,42
NA,"England, as shown by customs house",42
NA,"figures, following their various appoint-",42
NA,ments.,42
NA,The honorable member for Balaclava,42
NA,"( Mr White) had something to say, and",42
NA,"I fear in a derogatory way, about profes-",42
NA,"sional politicians. As a matter of fact,",42
NA,the right honorable member for Flinders,42
NA,( Mr Bruce) has always been quoted by,42
NA,"me as a politician who, immediately he",42
NA,"assumed government office, resigned from",42
NA,the directorate of his firm so that he could,42
NA,devote the whole of his time to his politi-,42
NA,cal duties. A ll honour to him for so,42
NA,doing. I make these remarks in reply to,42
NA,the unkind criticism of the honorable,42
NA,member for Balaclava.,42
NA,"I wish, also, to say a few words in",42
NA,reply to the observations of the honorable,42
NA,NA,42
NA,"about the "" paltry salary."" I n doing so,",42
NA,"I shall refer to Switzerland, the only real",42
NA,"democracy in the world. I n Switzerland,",42
NA,"the people control the parliament, not only",42
NA,"on election day, but on every day in the",42
NA,year. The Swiss people had a great com-,42
NA,"pliment paid to them when, with only the",42
NA,"reversal of the colours, their flag was",42
NA,adopted as the red cross emblem. On one,42
NA,occasion the Government decided to,42
NA,appoint a Swiss as a kind of com-,42
NA,missionerin the United States of,42
NA,"America. The officer appointed was to,",42
NA,"as it were, sit astride the two continents.",42
NA,The Federal Government fixed the re-,42
NA,muneration of the office at £400.,42
NA,The Swiss parliament always fixes a,42
NA,specific sum when making such ap-,42
NA,"pointments, and there are no additions",42
NA,"to it. The officer, in this case, was to use",42
NA,the consular offices in America. The,42
NA,Swiss people were not consulted about the,42
NA,"appointment, and were so incensed at the",42
NA,action of the Government that an initia-,42
NA,"tive petition was circulated, with the",42
NA,result that the Government had to cancel,42
NA,the appointment.,42
NA,Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m.,42
Dr MALONEY ," I say, with all",42
NA,"reverence, that God never created any-",42
NA,"thing His equal or His superior. Why,",42
NA,"then, should the electors, who are the",42
NA,"creators of - Parliament, once in every",42
NA,"three years, allow ^the created Parliament",42
NA,"-to make, itself more powerful than",42
NA,the electors? I f the people of Aus-,42
NA,tralia really had the power to control,42
NA,the Parliament that they have created,42
NA,they would not allow the payment of,43
NA,"salaries up to £5,000 a year. I t is ridicusecondary",43
NA,"lous, in view of our limited population,",43
NA,"to countenance, any longer, the main-",43
NA,tenance of an excrescence like Australia,43
NA,"House, costing as it did over £1,000,000,",43
NA,"including the land on which it'stands, and",43
NA,"a further £1,000,000 for other costs. This",43
NA,"is unjust to the people who elected.us, and",43
NA,it is not true democracy. I have always,43
NA,held that the law-maker fills the most,43
NA,important position to which man can,43
NA,aspire. Any man who gains the suffrages,43
NA,of his fellow citizens to become a member,43
NA,"of Parliament, and therefore, a law-",43
NA,"maker, should receive the highest salary",43
NA,"that is paid in the State, excepting per-",43
NA,haps that paid to scientists aud experts,43
NA,who are invited from time to time to,43
NA,report upon our railways and other,43
NA,institutions. For 50 years in and out of,43
NA,"Parliament, and for 43 years in Parlia-",43
NA,"ment, I have endeavoured to make the",43
NA,people the controlling power in the,43
NA,country. Until that has been done this,43
NA,"will not be a true democracy, for the",43
NA,created thing has more power than its,43
NA,creator.,43
Mr HUTCHINSON ,Indi) [8.7] -,43
NA,Honorable members are doing a disservice,43
NA,to their country in delaying the passage,43
NA,of the measure. I rise to reply to some,43
NA,"statements which, i f left unchallenged,",43
NA,would convey an erroneous impression,43
NA,concerning one who is not present to reply,43
NA,"to them, a gentleman who has always",43
NA,manifested a very high sense of national,43
NA,"duty, and' at the moment is on .the other",43
NA,"side of the world in furtherance, of the",43
NA,"interests of his country, the right honor-",43
NA,able member for Flinders ( Mr Bruce).,43
NA,The honorable member for Darling,43
NA,( Mr Blakeley) declared that he was not,43
NA,going to indulge in a personal attack,43
NA,upon the right honorable member for,43
NA,Flinders-an d promptly proceeded to do,43
NA,so. I n attempting to belittle the adminis-,43
NA,"tration of the right honorable gentleman,",43
NA,he alleged that Mr Bruce had worked,43
NA,"to the detriment of our secondary, and in",43
NA,favour of our importing industries. I,43
NA,"find, on examining the Commonwealth",43
NA,"Year-Booh, that the contrary is the case.",43
NA,During the regime of the Bruce-Page,43
NA,Government there was a rather large in-,43
NA,crease in the number of factories in Aus-,43
NA,tralia and a noticeable increase in the,43
NA,number of persons engaged in our,43
NA,industries. My investigations,43
NA,"also make it apparent that, despite the",43
NA,protestations of honorable members,43
NA,"opposite, the number of factories declined",43
NA,"somewhat, and the number pf employees",43
NA,in secondary industries declined consider-,43
NA,ably during the period that the Scullin,43
NA,"Government was in office, and that despite",43
NA,the huge array of tariff schedules intro-,43
NA,duced by that administration.,43
NA,An attack was also made upon the,43
NA,"borrowing policy of the""Bruce-Page Go-",43
NA,vernment. Every honorable member,43
NA,knows perfectly well that the great in-,43
NA,crease in borrowing that took place in the,43
NA,six or seven years during which that,43
NA,Government was in power was chiefly on,43
NA,"behalf of the States, not of the Common-",43
NA,wealth. I t was largely because of the,43
NA,endeavours of the right honorable mem-,43
NA,"ber for Flinders, in collaboration with",43
NA,the right honorable member for Cowper,43
NA,"(Dr Earle Page),.that the Loan Council",43
NA,came into being. That body had the,43
NA,"effect of steadying Australia's borrowing,",43
NA,and of making it possible to obtain loans,43
NA,on better terms. Certainly it has stood,43
NA,as a bulwark of safety during the rather,43
NA,disastrous period through which we are,43
NA,passing.,43
NA,The honorable member for Darling,43
NA,stated that the right honorable member,43
NA,for Flinders is a person devoid of Aus-,43
NA,tralian sentiment. There are two classes,43
NA,"of Australians, those whose outlook is",43
NA,"bounded by our shores, and those who",43
NA,realize that the security and safety of,43
NA,the Commonwealth are bound up with,43
NA,"Imperial relations, and a sound inter-",43
NA,national outlook. If the sneer,43
NA,of the honorable member for Darling,43
NA,places the right honorable member for,43
NA,"Flinders in the second category, it",43
NA,becomes a high compliment.,43
NA,The same honorable member insinuated,43
NA,that the right honorable member for,43
NA,Flinders is not temperamentally fitted for,43
NA,the task that he has undertaken. All who,43
NA,know the right honorable gentleman,43
NA,would scout the suggestion that he is tem-,43
NA,"peramentally unbalanced, incautious, apt",43
NA,"to be swayed by illogical contentions, or",43
NA,by sentimental appeals. Honorable mem-,43
NA,bers who cannot do better than make,43
NA,such ludicrous attacks upon a person,43
NA,noted for his logic and imperturbability,44
NA,should remain silent.,44
NA,Then the accusation was levelled at the,44
NA,"right honorable member that, while over-",44
NA,"seas, he will sacrifice the interests of",44
NA,nation to his personal advantage. The,44
NA,honorable member who made that accusa-,44
NA,tion should feel ashamed.,44
NA,The honorable member for Hunter,44
NA,"( Mr James) declared that, the right hon-",44
NA,orable member for Flinders obtained the,44
NA,"bulk of his education abroad, aud con-",44
NA,sidered himself so superior to the people,44
NA,"of Australia that, when the war broke out",44
NA,he enlisted in Great Britain. Those who,44
NA,are familiar with the right honorable,44
NA,gentleman's history are aware that he had,44
NA,a splendid athletic and scholastic career,44
NA,in one of Melbourne's public schools. On,44
NA,the second point I may say that instead of,44
NA,"returning to Australia to enlist, and so",44
NA,"wasting time, the right honorable member",44
NA,"for Flinders, being in. England at the",44
NA,"time, seized the earliest opportunity to",44
NA,"enlist, so that he might give his services",44
NA,"during the dark days of 1914-18, au ex-",44
NA,ample which might well have been fol-,44
NA,lowed by a goodly number of honorable,44
NA,members on the other side of the House-,44
NA,"Very few members of this House, I am",44
NA,"sure, really believe that the Government",44
NA,could have appointed any one else who,44
NA,would perform this work as satisfactorily,44
NA,"as Mr Bruce could do. For once, I",44
NA,shall venture to assume the role of. pro-,44
NA,phet. I am quite certain that after he,44
NA,"has accomplished his mission, and per-",44
NA,formed a great national service for Aus-,44
NA,"tralia, Mr Bruce will return, with his",44
NA,reputation enhanced both at home and,44
NA,abroad.,44
Mr THOMPSON ,New England) to,44
NA,[8.16] -I t seems to me that the real,44
NA,nose of this bill is being clouded by,44
NA,persona] attack directed by members,44
NA,the Opposition against the right honorMinisters.,44
NA,able member for Flinders ( Mr Bruce).,44
NA,T exonerate the right honorahle the,44
NA,"Loader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin),",44
NA,"whose remarks were very fair, and",44
NA,that critical nature which we hayc come,44
NA,to expect from him. One can only conthe,44
NA,"clude, after hearing the speeches of some",44
NA,"of his colleagues, however, that they",44
NA,been waiting for the opportunity to throw,44
NA,mud at the right honorable member for,44
NA,Flindevs.,44
NA,"Mr BEASLEY/ -O f course, the right",44
NA,honorable member never threw any mud,44
NA,himself.',44
Mr THOMPSON ,"No , I do not",44
NA,the think he ever did. This personal attack,44
NA,by honorable members who are opposing,44
NA,the bill has completely vitiated their,44
NA,arguments. Their criticism is clearly,44
NA,inspired by personal malice of a type,44
NA,"that is seldom seen in this House, and",44
NA,which I myself have never witnessed here,44
NA,before.,44
Mr WARD ,Tha t is a great pity!,44
Mr THOMPSON ,"Yes , it is, and I",44
NA,may add that it is only since the advent,44
NA,of the honorable member for East Syd-,44
NA,"ney ( Mr Ward), and his colleagues in",44
NA,"this House, that we have got down to the",44
NA,"low level-almos t to the gutter level, I",44
NA,might say-tha t characterizes on some,44
NA,"occasions, the proceedings of the Parlia-",44
NA,ment of Now South Wales.,44
NA,This bill introduces a new principle.',44
NA,The propositi to send a Resident Minister,44
NA,"to London has been discussed before, but",44
NA,it has always been regarded as imprac-,44
NA,"ticable. I wtis surprised, therefore, to",44
NA,learn that the matter had been revived by,44
NA,"this Government, and that it was pro-",44
NA,posed to appoint such a Minister. I,44
NA,like to see new ideas introduced-w e do,44
NA,not have enough of them in Australia-,44
NA,and i f this is going to be an improvement,44
NA,on the ghastly failure of the high com-,44
NA,tnissionership during the last fifteen,44
NA,"years, it is to be welcomed. I am sure",44
NA,that the great majority of the citizens of,44
NA,Australia have been bitterly disappointed,44
NA,at the results achieved by the High Com-,44
NA,missioners iri London. This is not due,44
NA,the calibre of the men who have repre-,44
NA,"pursented us abroad, although it is true, as",44
NA,"a somebody has said, that they have gener-",44
NA,of ally been discarded politicians or ex-,44
NA,The office has been dragged,44
NA,"down to the level of a mere political job,",44
NA,to be offered to some individual who has,44
NA,"hecome, for the moment, inconvenient.",44
NA,of No fault could be found with some of,44
NA,the men who have filled this position i n,44
NA,past. Such men as Sir George Beid,44
NA,and Sir Joseph Cook rendered good ser-,44
NA,"have vice to their country, and the recent",44
NA,"occupant of the position, Sir Granville",44
NA,"Ryrie, has filled i t worthily, considering",44
NA,his own confession that he was not used,44
NA,"to that kind of work. A t any rate, he",45
NA,has maintained the prestige of Australia.,45
NA,The point at issue i n connexion with,45
NA,this proposal is not the merits or de-,45
NA,merits of the right honorable member f or,45
NA,Flinders. We who have known the right,45
NA,"honorable gentleman, and have seen his",45
NA,"work as Prime Minister, regard him as",45
NA,the outstanding man f or a position,45
NA,such as this. We have no doubt that the,45
NA,Government has chosen wisely. Never-,45
NA,"theless, this appointment represents a",45
NA,"new departure i n Australian politics, and",45
NA,I should be surprised i f i t turns out to,45
NA,be more thana temporary experiment.,45
NA,I am not hostile to the Government on,45
NA,"this issue, but I remind honorable mem-",45
NA,bers that a condition upon which mem-,45
NA,bers are elected to this Parliament is,45
NA,that they remain in Australia and per-,45
NA,sonally attend to the needs of their con-,45
NA,stituents. I t is obvious that i f the right,45
NA,"honorable member f o r Flinders, useful as",45
NA,"he may be to Australia while abroad, is",45
NA,"to remain i n London f or two years, he",45
NA,w i l l not be able to represent the people,45
NA,of Flinders i n this House. I t may be,45
NA,that the electors of Flinders are suffi-,45
NA,"ciently patriotic, or will be so nattered at",45
NA,his having been picked on f or this experi-,45
NA,"ment, that they w i l l be quite"" satisfied to",45
NA,allow their representative to go abroad,45
NA,practically f o r the whole term of Parlia-,45
NA,"ment, and, i f so. i t shows that they have",45
NA,been able to take a larger view of the,45
NA,matter than we may expect the electors,45
NA,of most constituencies to do.,45
Mr MAXWELL ,The y have their,45
NA,remedy i n their own hands.,45
Mr THOMPSON , Y e s ; but is,45
NA,f a i r to put any electorate i n the position,45
NA,of having to take i t or leave it? Is i t,45
NA,"f a i r to say to the electors of Flinders, or",45
NA,"any other constituency, "" This is the man",45
NA,we have selected to send abroad. He,45
NA,is going to London as our ambassador,45
NA,"for two years, and we are handing over",45
NA,to one of his colleagues the task of repre-,45
NA,senting you as well as his own con-,45
NA,"stituents "". I am assuming that the",45
NA,Government has not taken any steps-to,45
NA,find out whether the electors of Flinders,45
NA,are agreeable to this most radical change.,45
NA,"I presume that, the prestige of Mr Bruce",45
NA,is so high to-day that the great majority,45
NA,of his electors are prepared to subscribe,45
NA,to that change; but does not that of itself,45
NA,indicate that the Government is able to,45
NA,do this only because of his high prestige,45
NA,and outstanding personality. No other,45
NA,electorate would subscribe to the arrange-,45
NA,ment f o r a moment. I f a man who was,45
NA,standing f o r Parliament were to tell the,45
NA,"electors that, i f elected, he had a chance",45
NA,of going abroad as ambassador f or two,45
NA,"years, I feel sure that he would not have",45
NA,a chance of being returned. I t is evi-,45
NA,"dent, therefore, that the Government is",45
NA,merely making use of the services of Mr .,45
NA,"Bruce while they are available, and is not",45
NA,contemplating making this f o r m of repre-,45
NA,"sentation a permanent one. Therefore,",45
NA,"in my opinion, the position could have",45
NA,"been met without introducing this bill,",45
NA,merely by allowing Mr Bruce to go,45
NA,to London f o i ' six or twelve months in,45
NA,order to carry through tlie necessary,45
NA,financial operations. I t would only be,45
NA,"necessary to announce to the people that,",45
NA,"in due course, he would be returning to",45
NA,"Australia, and that the position of H i g h",45
NA,Commissioner would then be recon-,45
NA,sidered.,45
NA,There is no doubt that the High Coni-,45
NA,missionership will have to be reviewed,45
NA,in the near future. Some honorable,45
NA,members have referred to the high cost of,45
NA,"Australia House, and have questioned",45
NA,the actual value of the H i g h Commis-,45
NA,sionership to Australia. I t is extra-,45
NA,"ordinary that, although originally the",45
NA,High Commissioner was supposed to per-,45
NA,form' all the functions of a Besident,45
NA,"Minister, and almost those of an",45
NA,"ambassador, i n London, he has never",45
NA,actually done anything of the kind. We,45
NA,have always had the spectacle of a stream,45
NA,i t of Ministers going to London on one,45
NA,pretext or another. The last Government,45
NA,"cannot dispute that, because i t sent as",45
NA,many of its members abroad as did any,45
NA,"other government. Indeed, on one",45
NA,"occasion, i t sent nearly half the Ministry.",45
Mr GARDNER ,Onl y four Ministers.,45
NA,Mr THOMPSON ' - I stand cor-,45
NA,rected; i t sent only four. This sending,45
NA,of Ministers abroad has proved of how,45
NA,little use the H i g h Commissionership,45
NA,has been to Australia. On the financial,45
NA,"side, also, i t has failed us. A little while",45
NA,ago we found i t necessary to send a,45
NA,"high Treasury official, Mr Collins,",45
NA,"abroad., as our financial adviser, and f o r",45
NA,the last twelve months he has been vir-,45
NA,tually i n charge of Australia House.,45
NA,The position of High Commissioner will,46
NA,"shortly become vacant, and the Govern-",46
NA,"ment, I think, is wise in not following",46
NA,the haphazard practice of its prede-,46
NA,cessors in grabbing the first handy man,46
NA,and sending him abroad as Australia's,46
NA,representative. The Government has,46
NA,done the right thing in holding up the,46
NA,"appointment. I feel sure that, perhaps",46
NA,"before twelve months have gone by, the",46
NA,Government will be forced to alter its,46
NA,policy of having a Resident Minister in,46
NA,London. 1 do not think that it will be,46
NA,possible or practicable for the right,46
NA,orable member for Flinders to stay away,46
NA,from Australia and continue to represent,46
NA,a section of the electors of the Com-,46
NA,monwealth. On the surface the proposal,46
NA,"is a most extraordinary one, and I",46
NA,think the Government will be forced to,46
NA,"make an alteration, because the new",46
NA,arrangement will be found to be,46
NA,"impracticable. I n the meantime, there",46
NA,is no High Commissioner in Lon-,46
NA,"don, and we must have some one",46
NA,there with the necessary status and,46
NA,authority to handle the gigantic financial,46
NA,operations now crowding on us. The,46
NA,right honorable member for Flinders,46
NA,"understands high finance, and can",46
NA,"handle big operations, and as a",46
NA,Minister he will have the necessary,46
NA,prestige to move effectively in London,46
NA,financial circles. I disregard the sugges-,46
NA,tion that the position will be merely a,46
NA,social one.; but a country's ambassador,46
NA,"must have social prestige, and the right",46
NA,honorable member for Flinders will,46
NA,represent Australia with dignity. He,46
NA,will certainly create a favorable im-,46
NA,pression on the other side of the world.,46
NA,He has been attacked on the ground of,46
NA,his alleged financial incompetency and,46
NA,the record of the Bruce-Page Govern-,46
NA,"ment has been cited, mostly by persons",46
NA,who were not in this Parliament,46
NA,"when it was in power, and are mere",46
NA,newcomers to politics. I venture to,46
NA,say that the most vitriolic of the,46
NA,clitics of the right honorable mem-,46
NA,ber for Flinders have not taken the,46
NA,trouble to look up the figures of the,46
NA,Bruce-Page regime. They are figures,46
NA,whose accuracy cannot be challenged. I n,46
NA,"-its six and a half years of office, the",46
NA,Bruce-Page Government borrowed,46
NA,"£220,000,000.",46
Mr SPEAKER ,Order !,46
Mr THOMPSON ,I t has been,46
NA,claimed that the qualifications of the,46
NA,right honorable member for Flinders are,46
NA,vitiated by the financial record of his,46
NA,"government, and I want, briefly, to indi-",46
NA,cate the merits of the financial adminis-,46
NA,tration of that Government to show why,46
NA,we have so much faith in this particular,46
NA,appointment. One of the outstanding,46
NA,qualifications of the right honorable mem- -,46
NA,ber is the great success with which he,46
NA,handled the financial problems of Aus-,46
NA,hon- tralia. A great deal has been said about,46
NA,the tremendous borrowings of the Bruce-,46
NA,"Page Government, and about its extrava-",46
NA,"gance. As a matter of fact, in the six",46
NA,and a half years it was forced to borrow,46
NA,"£207,000,000 on behalf of the States.",46
NA,Members of the Labour party in the,46
NA,State Parliaments were just as insistent,46
NA,as other parties in forcing the Common-,46
NA,"wealth to borrow on their behalf, so that",46
NA,money could be spent on State public,46
NA,works.,46
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! I f I were,46
NA,to permit the honorable member to ad-,46
NA,duce many more figures relating to the,46
NA,financial administration of the Bruce-,46
NA,"Page Government, I might just as well",46
NA,allow him to traverse the whole of the,46
NA,record of that Government. Honorable,46
NA,members will admit that they have been,46
NA,"given .great latitude during this debate,",46
NA,but I must now insist on some attempt,46
NA,being made to connect remarks with the,46
NA,bill.,46
Mr THOMPSON,I A accept your,46
NA,"correction, Mr Speaker, but some hon-",46
NA,"orable members, having already cited",46
NA,"figures, I thought it proper to reply to",46
NA,"them. Briefly, I may say, that the Bruce-",46
NA,Page Government established sinking,46
NA,funds which reduced the war debt by,46
NA,"£45,000,000. That was done under the",46
NA,"leadership of a gentleman who, some",46
NA,"honorable members say, has not the capa-",46
NA,city to be a Besident Minister in London,46
NA,or to carry out important financial trans-,46
NA,actions. The record of the Bruce-Page,46
NA,Government stands for itself. I t is true,46
NA,"that there was a lot of money to spend,",46
NA,and that the right honorable member,46
NA,"spent i t like a gentleman, but during the",46
NA,whole of that time there was an insis-,46
NA,tent demand from all quarters that the,46
NA,Commonwealth Government should spend,46
NA,every penny it could lay its hands on.,47
NA,"I n those years, the Government which did",47
NA,"not borrow at the rate of £40,000,000 a",47
NA,"year was regarded as a "" d u d "" ; as one",47
NA,that was not doing its job. I t is of no,47
NA,use saying now that the happenings,47
NA,of that period were evidence of the,47
NA,incapacity of the right honorable member,47
NA,"for Flinders, or that he was the most",47
NA,disastrous Prime Minister whom Aus-,47
NA,"tralia has ever had, and certainly",47
NA,the worst man we could send to,47
NA,London to handle important conver-,47
NA,"sion operations. For these reasons,",47
NA,"apart from the point 1 have raised,",47
NA,that it is very doubtful whether,47
NA,the electors of Flinders are getting a fair,47
NA,"deal, I cannot find fault with the present",47
NA,proposal. So far as the personality of,47
NA,"the man chosen is concerned, the case is",47
NA,"complete. I think that 90 per cent, of",47
NA,"- the people of Australia, even the sup-",47
NA,porters of the vociferous party opposing,47
NA,"the Government, if asked their opinion,",47
NA,would say that they have per-,47
NA,fect faith in - the ability,47
NA,the right honorable member for,47
NA,Flinders to represent Australia in these,47
NA,important financial transactions abroad.,47
Mr WARD ,East Sydney) [8.40] -,47
NA,The whole of the debate seems to have,47
NA,centred upon the gentleman chosen,47
NA,"as Resident Minister in London, and very",47
NA,little reason has been shown by sup-,47
NA,porters of the Government why any one,47
NA,should be sent to the other side of the,47
NA,world as Resident Minister. I have,47
NA,heard it suggested that one reason why,47
NA,the right honorable member for Flinders,47
NA,( Mr Bruce) has been chosen is that he,47
NA,was not prepared to take a subordinate,47
NA,post in this Cabinet as a Minister without,47
NA,"Portfolio, and thought that it would",47
NA,probably sound much better i f his title,47
NA,were Resident Minister in London; and,47
NA,that i f a conversion loan is successfully,47
NA,floated he will return to take up the posi- of the bill.,47
NA,tion he has occupied since the general,47
NA,"election, although not nominally-tha t of",47
NA,leader of the Government and Prime,47
NA,Minister.,47
NA,I am not satisfied that the Government,47
NA,has given us the full reasons why the,47
NA,right honorable member for Flinders has,47
NA,been sent to the other side of the world.,47
NA,With all due respect to those who say that,47
NA,the negotiations at Ottawa were carried,47
NA,out satisfactorily so far as Australia is,47
NA,"concerned, I beg to differ from them. I",47
NA,say that the interests of Australia were,47
NA,"sacrificed, and the people of this country",47
NA,will realize that in the near future. We,47
NA,"find, on reading the press reports, which",47
NA,the Prime Minister says are substantially,47
NA,"correct, that-",47
NA,Australia undertakes that protection by,47
NA,tariffs shall be afforded only to those indus-,47
NA,tries wliich are reasonably assured of a sound,47
NA,"opportunity for success, and undertakes also",47
NA,that during the currency of the agreement,47
NA,the tariff shall be based on the principle that,47
NA,the protective duties shall not exceed such a,47
NA,levdl as will give British producers the full,47
NA,opportunity for reasonable competition on the,47
NA,basis of the relative cost of economical and,47
NA,efficient production.,47
NA,Who is to determine this ? I n my opinion,47
NA,the right honorable member for Flinders,47
NA,is transferring the seat of Government of,47
NA,the Commonwealth to the other side of,47
NA,the world. From London he will indicate,47
NA,which Australian industries the British,47
NA,capitalists think should be sacrificed. He,47
NA,is certainly qualified to undertake,47
NA,of that task. .So far as his Australian out-,47
NA,"look is concerned, all that we can",47
NA,say about him is that it was the,47
NA,misfortune of Australia that he was born,47
NA,in this country. I t is all eyewash for the,47
NA,right honorable member for Cowper (Dr,47
NA,Earle Page) to try to justify this,47
NA,appointment by saying that it is very,47
NA,necessary that members of this Parlia-,47
NA,ment should have a knowledge of foreign,47
NA,"affairs and international events, while a",47
NA,film depicting development in another,47
NA,part of the world is not permitted to he,47
NA,screened in Australia.,47
Mr SPEAKER ,Order !,47
Mr WARD ,Othe r honorable mem-,47
NA,bers,47
Mr SPEAKER ,I t is not a question,47
NA,of what other honorahle members have,47
NA,said; the Chair must insist on the strict,47
NA,relevancy of the debate to the provisions,47
Mr WARD ,Th e honorable member,47
NA,for Balaclava spoke of professional poli-,47
NA,ticians; of men unsuccessful in other,47
NA,"callings, but having the gift of the gab,",47
NA,being able to secure positions in Parlia-,47
NA,"ment. I n reply to him, I say",47
NA,that the man who has no outside ties,47
NA,can speak his mind in this chamber; but,47
NA,the man with outside interests is inclined-,47
NA,to let his judgment be dictated by those,47
NA,interests. The right honorable member,47
NA,for Flinders will not only find his task,48
NA,"in London a pleasing one, but will also",48
NA,be.serving his own interests as a member,48
NA,of a big importing firm which is not,48
NA,favorably disposed towards the build-,48
NA,ing up of Australian industries.,48
NA,The right houorable member for,48
NA,Cowper (Dr Earle Page) remarked,48
NA,that it would not matter if no,48
NA,saving were being made as the,48
NA,result of the Government's proposal.,48
NA,"Of course, in dealing with the appoint-",48
NA,ment as Resident Minister in Loudon of,48
NA,a member to whom honorable members,48
NA,"opposite, and in the Country party, look",48
NA,"with reverence, thousands of pounds can",48
NA,be spent without comment; but within,48
NA,"a few days, when supporters of the Go-",48
NA,vernment will be dealing with invalid,48
NA,"and old-age pensions, they will consider",48
NA,every penny! We are told that the,48
NA,palatial qnarter3 provided for the High,48
NA,Commissioner in London are not suffi-,48
NA,cient to hoii3C the right honorable member,48
NA,for Flinders. What are his special quali-,48
NA,"fications, of which so much has been said",48
NA,to-day? I f we require a representative,48
NA,in London merely to wear a top bat at the,48
NA,"right angle, or look well in spats, no doubt",48
NA,the right man has been chosen for the,48
NA,position. I understood that we were to,48
NA,hear some useful remarks from the,48
NA,"honorable member for Corio ( Mr Casey),",48
NA,but despite his experience on the other,48
NA,"side of the'world, the only contribution",48
NA,that he made to this debate was an objec-,48
NA,tion to the insinuation that the right,48
NA,honorable member for Flinders was not,48
NA,a suitable person to represent Australia,48
NA,abroad. I make no apology for what 1,48
NA,have said concerning the right honorable,48
NA,member. He has not an Australian out-,48
NA,"look, and he cannot possibly look after",48
NA,the interests of the people of this country,48
NA,in a proper manner. I f the desire was to,48
NA,appoint a British Imperialist to repre-,48
NA,"sent us in London, the right man has been",48
NA,chosen. He will make a. good represen-,48
NA,"tative of Britain, but a poor one of Aus-",48
NA,tralia. The object of the Ottawa Con-,48
NA,ference was to organize the British Em-,48
NA,"pire as a solid economic unit, so that it",48
NA,would be in a favorable position to,48
NA,compete with other similar combinations,48
NA,"of peoples, including those of the",48
NA,United States of America; which are,48
NA,making inroads upon the British,48
NA,markets. Great Britain does not,48
NA,desire the secondary industries of,48
NA,Australia to be built up. I t wishes to,48
NA,"see them sacrificed, and desires that we",48
NA,shall confine our attention to the pro-,48
NA,duction of the raw materials required in,48
NA,factories overseas.,48
NA,"I remember, a few months ago, the Go-",48
NA,vernment and its supporters scoffing at,48
NA,certain suggestions put forward by my,48
NA,party for the conversion of loans at re-,48
NA,duced rates of interest. That policy was,48
NA,said to be one of repudiation. I t was,48
NA,declared that my party was proceeding,48
NA,"on wrong lines, and that there should be",48
NA,no compulsory conversion of loans. When,48
NA,"the party opposite, in conjunction with",48
NA,"the then government, appealed to the pub-",48
NA,"lic for the conversion of internal loans, it",48
NA,promised that compulsion would not be,48
NA,applied; but the Government said to the,48
NA,"bondholders: "" We shall give you until a",48
NA,"certain' date to convert voluntarily, and",48
NA,"after that you will have to convert"". Let",48
NA,"the Government lay its cards on the table,",48
NA,and say frankly why the right honorable,48
NA,member for Flinders is being sent abroad.,48
NA,It should let the people know that Aus-,48
NA,tralia's interests are being sacrificed. The,48
NA,"people will realize that, in any event, a",48
NA,few months hence. Many members op-,48

NA,bered solely as one-Parliament members.,48
NA,.Their return at the last election was due,48
NA,to the fact that on that occasion the elec-,48
NA,tors suffered from a form of temporary,48
NA,insanity. The sooner the people have,48
NA,an opportunity to return to power a go-,48
NA,vernment with a truly Australian outlook,48
NA,to correct the wrongs committed by the,48
NA,present anti-Australian Government,48
NA,represented on the other side of the,48

Mr SPEAKER ,Th e honorable mem-,48
NA,"ber may not apply the term "" anti-Aus-",48
NA,"tralia]! "" to a member of this House. I",48
NA,ask him to withdraw the expression.,48
Mr WARD , I withdraw it. I f a,48
NA,revulsion of feeling has not already,48
NA,"occurred throughout the Commonwealth,",48
NA,public opinion will inevitably swing,48
NA,against the Government a.t no distant,48
NA,"date, and an opportunity will then be",48
NA,afforded to put into operation a true Aus-,48
NA,tralian policy. I f the qualifications of,48
NA,the right honorable member for Flinders,48
NA,"are beyond question, why this spirited",49
NA,defence of them? Many supporters of,49
NA,the Government 'have rushed to his,49
NA,defence.,49
Mr WHITE ,Becaus e he is absent.,49
Mr WARD ,Th e right honorable,49
NA,member had not to wait until he left,49
NA,Australia to know what my party thought,49
NA,of him. I realize that the Government,49
NA,has the necessary number of supporters,49
NA,in this House to enable it to pass this,49
NA,"bill, and to retain the right honorable",49
NA,member as Resident Minister in London,49
NA,for as long a term as i t will,49
NA,remain in . office; but honorable,49
NA,members opposite should not prate,49
NA,about his special qualifications. The,49
NA,fact cannot be disguised that he has,49
NA,gone to London as Resident Minister to,49
NA,obtain directions from the British,49
NA,imperialists as to certain action that shall,49
NA,"be taken in this country, and those in-",49
NA,structions will be carried out to the,49
NA,The Government may go ahead with its,49
NA,policy; but the members o.f my party,49
NA,will tell the people the true position.,49
NA,Although we number only five in this,49
NA,"House, we represent 540,000 voters in",49
NA,New South Wales. I f the opportunity,49
NA,"were presented for another election, our",49
NA,"numbers would be vastly increased, and",49
NA,the fact would be revealed that we now,49
NA,have the support of the majority of the,49
NA,electors in that State. When a true,49
NA,Labour Government is returned to this,49
NA,"Parliament, this anti-Australian bill will",49
NA,be repealed.,49
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,Warhe,49
NA,ringah-Ministe r for the Interior) out of it.,49
NA,[8.54] -Thi s simple measure merely,49
NA,gives the right honorable member for,49
NA,"Flinders ( Mr Bruce), while in London,",49
NA,"the powers of the' High Commissioner,",49
NA,and it is extraordinary that so much,49
NA,extraneous matter has been imported,49
NA,into this debate. The most bitter attacks,49
NA,have been made on the right honorable,49
NA,gentleman. Some honorable members,49
NA,were unfair enough to preface their,49
NA,remarks by stating that they did,49
NA,"intend to be personal, and to follow",49
NA,that opening observation with spleto,49
NA,"netic outbursts, because the right honto",49
NA,"orable member, being absent, could I t",49
NA,"not reply to them. I f he had been here,",49
NA,I venture to say that not one of those,49
NA,members would have been game to say a sioner.,49
NA,fraction of what they have said this after-,49
NA,noon and to-night. When the right,49
NA,"honorable member is in this chamber, he",49
NA,can well look after himself. We have,49
NA,listened with close attention to the state-,49
NA,ments that he has made on various,49
NA,"occasions on important subjects, and the",49
NA,utterances of few members of this House,49
NA,have commanded so much respect as,49
NA,have those of the right honorable mem-,49
NA,"ber for Flinders on financial matters,",49
NA,"imperial' issues, and foreign relations.",49
NA,When the history of this country,49
NA,"comes to be written, i t will not",49
NA,deal with the record of mem-,49
NA,bers like the honorable member,49
NA,"for East Sydney ( Mr Ward), but",49
NA,blazoned on the scroll of fame will be the,49
NA,name of the right honorable member for,49
NA,Flinders. The honorable member for,49
NA,East Sydney asked why i t was thought,49
NA,necessary to defend him. I admit that,49
NA,it is unnecessary to defend him,49
NA,letter. either in this House or before the,49
NA,people; but should we who are,49
NA,his friends allow his name to be,49
NA,traduced in his absence by men who are,49
NA,not fit to clean his boots? I f the views,49
NA,expi'essed by the speaker who has,49
NA,just resumed his seat are a fair sample,49
NA,"of Australian opinion, I have no desire",49
NA,"to be associated with it . I realize, how-",49
NA,"ever, that he has merely voiced senti-",49
NA,ments that may be heard in the purlieus,49
NA,of Woolloomooloo. They are not true,49
NA,Australian sentiments; but the honor-,49
NA,able member for East Sydney knows no,49
NA,"others. Brought up in that atmosphere,",49
NA,"grovels in it, and he will never get",49
NA,"The purpose of the bill is clear, and I",49
NA,do not intend to analyse the speeches of,49
NA,honorable members who have opposed it.,49
NA,For many years i t has been recognized,49
NA,that Australia should have a High Com-,49
NA,missioner in London. The thoughtful,49
NA,members of the community realize that,49
NA,Australia has interests which are not,49
NA,bounded by the confines of this con-,49
NA,"not tinent, but extend throughout the",49
NA,"world, and that i t is necessary",49
NA,have a representative in London,49
NA,safeguard our interests there.,49
NA,has never been proposed in,49
NA,this House until this afternoon that we,49
NA,should abolish the office of High Commis-,49
NA,The Leader of the Opposition,49
NA,( Mr Scullin) suggested that i f he had,50
NA,remained in office he would not have,50
NA,"renewed the appointment, but would have",50
NA,permitted the financial adviser in London,50
NA,to do tie work previously carried out by,50
NA,"the High Commissioner. I f so, why did",50
NA,the right honorable member make that,50
NA,belated announcement on this important,50
NA,"subject? Of course, the right honor-",50
NA,able member feels it incumbent upon him,50
NA,to oppose tlie action taken by this Governof,50
NA,"ment, and nobody in this House, so far",50
NA,"as any recollection goes, has proved a",50
NA,greater adept than the Leader of the,50
NA,Opposition at putting up bogeys and,50
NA,knocking thorn down. I sat amazed at,50
NA,the way he advanced debating-club argu-,50
NA,"ments, and then proceeded to dispose of",50
NA,them with a seriousness that was most,50
NA,impressive to those who did not know,50
NA,"him. Apparently, honorable members",50
NA,opposite would have us believe that,50
NA,matters of such far-reaching consequences,50
NA,as the conversion of overseas loans could,50
NA,he dealt with satisfactorily by an officer,50
NA,at Australia House. I need hardly,50
NA,mention the advantage to Australia of,50
NA,"having, at the heart of the Empire, a man",50
NA,who knows what the Commonwealth Go-,50
NA,vernment wishes to have done. I feel,50
NA,"sure, also, that -if the people had an",50
NA,opportunity to express their views on this,50
NA,"subject, they would be overwhelmingly",50
NA,"in favour of the appointment, because",50
NA,"they know that, by his ability, courage",50
NA,"and diplomacy, he would be able to carry",50
NA,through successfully any mission,50
NA,entrusted to him. The majority of honor-,50
NA,able members will agree that no member,50
NA,of this House could better discharge the,50
NA,responsible duties which will fall to the,50
NA,lot of the right honorable member for,50
NA,Flinders while in London. I rarely,50
NA,take notice of the interjections of,50
NA,the honorable member for East,50
NA,"Sydney ( Mr Ward), or, for that",50
NA,"matter, of the interjections of other",50
NA,members of the group to which he belongs.,50
NA,"They represent only about 5 per cent, of",50
NA,"the electors of this country, and are",50
NA,remarkable more for the noisy expression,50
NA,of views than for common sense in its,50
NA,application to the practical affairs of,50
NA,everyday life. I strongly deprecate the,50
NA,unfair attack made by members of this,50
NA,group this evening upon the right honor-,50
NA,"able member for Flinders, who has given",50
NA,"such sterling service to this country, and",50
NA,is destined to render still greater service,50
NA,during the next few years. The over-,50
NA,whelming majority by which the bill will,50
NA,be carried will truly reflect the estimatidn,50
NA,in which the right honorable gentleman is .,50
NA,held by the people of Australia.,50
Mr A GREEN ,Kalgoorlie) [9.4] -,50
NA,The Minister for the Interior ( Mr.,50
NA,Parkhill) did not deal with the merits,50
NA,the bill. He -confined his remarks to,50
NA,a defence of the appointment of the right,50
NA,honorable member for Flinders ( Mr.,50
NA,Bruce) to an entirely new position created,50
NA,by this Government. I t is not my inten-,50
NA,tion to say anything about the right,50
NA,"honorable gentleman who, for the next",50
NA,"year or two, is to be Resident Minister",50
NA,for the Commonwealth in London; but,50
NA,I do not share the views of the Minister,50
NA,"for the Interior, who has just treated the",50
NA,House' to an idolatrous panegyric of his,50
NA,"Cabinet colleague, and I may add that his",50
NA,opinion is not endorsed by a considerable,50
NA,number of people in this country. This,50
NA,is not because tkey have any personal,50
NA,"animus against him, but simply because",50
NA,their - conception of Australian senti-,50
NA,ment is not his. The Minister for the,50
NA,Interior deprecated the personalities,50
NA,"which, he said, had been indulged iu by",50
NA,the honorable member for East Sydney,50
NA,"( Mr Ward) ; but, apart from criticism",50
NA,"that is personal or offensive, tlie pro-",50
NA,"jected appointment by this Government,",50
NA,of a Resident Minister in London is a fit,50
NA,subject for criticism. The Minister for,50
NA,the Interior deplored any criticism of,50
NA,"the right honorable member for Flinders,",50
NA,but in his own references to the honor-,50
NA,able member for East Sydney he said,50
NA,"things of an offensive character such as,",50
NA,"so far as my knowledge goes, have not",50
NA,been said by any other member of this,50
NA,House.,50
Mr BEASLEY ,An d was not called,50
NA,upon to withdraw.,50
NA,"Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! I ask the",50
NA,honorable member for West Sydney ( Mr.,50
NA,Beasley) to explain his statement that,50
NA,the Minister for the Interior made offen-,50
NA,sive remarks concerning another honor-,50
NA,"able member, and was not reprimanded",50
NA,by the Chair.,50
Mr BEASLEY , I was referring to the,50
NA,remark of the Minister for the Interior,50
NA,concerning the anti-Australian outlook,50
NA,of the right honorable member for,50
NA,flinders. The Minister almost went to,51
NA,the level of the gutter in his attack on,51
NA,"the honorable member for East .Sydney,",51
NA,saying that he came from the gutters of,51
NA,Woollooinooloo.,51
Mr SPEAKER ,I f that is all he has,51
NA,"to complain of, I ask the honorable",51
NA,"member for ""West Sydney to apologize",51
NA,for what he said.,51
Mr BEASLEY , I apologize.,51
NA,"Mr A GREEN"" -Wha t the Minister",51
NA,said was that the honorable member for,51
NA,East Sydney ( Mr Ward) was brought up,51
NA,"in the purlieus of Woolloomooloo, and",51
NA,couhl never get out of them. I consider,51
NA,"that remark highly offensive, and remind",51
NA,i he Minister that the honorable member,51
NA,for East Sydney was elected by a sub-,51
NA,stantial majority of the people living in,51
NA,that electorate.,51
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! There was,51
NA,considerable interruption when the Minis-,51
NA,"ter for the Interior was speaking, and I",51
NA,did iiot understand him to refer to the,51
NA,honorable member for East Sydney in,51
NA,"those terms. I f he did so, I ask him to",51
NA,withdraw the remark.,51
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,Wha t,51
NA,said was that the sentiments which the,51
NA,honorable member for East Sydney were,51
NA,expressing were the sentiments of tho,51
NA,purlieus of Woolloomooloo.,51
Mr A GREEN ,Th e Attorney-,51
NA,General ( Mr Latham) in support of the,51
NA,"bill to-day, said that the appointment",51
NA,of the right honorable member for,51
NA,Flinders was made because of his finan-,51
NA,cial ability and prestige. The Minister,51
NA,"emphasized the latter point, and suggested",51
NA,that the right houorable gentleman had,51
NA,been selected for the position because of,51
NA,his wide knowledge of the financial pro-,51
NA,"blems which confront Australia. I , and",51
NA,"other honorable members on this side,",51
NA,take the view that we need to cultivate,51
NA,"an Australian sentiment, not necessarily",51
NA,"in antagonism to Great Britain, but be-",51
NA,cause our trade interests need special,51
NA,attention. The Ottawa Conference deci-,51
NA,sions reveal the fact that wo must be,51
NA,prepared to fight for the preservation of,51
NA,"our trade interests, just as the British",51
NA,delegates at Ottawa fought for the trade,51
NA,interests of the Mother Country. The,51
NA,renvesentotive in Great. Britain of White,51
NA,"TIous"" does not sink his indivi-",51
NA,duality as an American citizen. He does,51
NA,"not pose as an Englishman, in order to",51
NA,make himself acceptable to the people of,51
NA,Great Britain. They know that he comes,51
NA,"to them as a plain American, represent-",51
NA,ing the views of the Government of the,51
NA,"United States of ""America, and does not",51
NA,deem it necessary to go to the court of,51
NA,"St. James in court dress. That, I sug-",51
NA,"gest, is the spirit which the representative",51
NA,of Australia should emulate in the,51
NA,Mother Country. I am opposed to the,51
NA,"bill, because such an appointment has",51
NA,"never been found necessary before, and",51
NA,because the Ministry has advanced no,51
NA,sound reason why it should be made. The,51
NA,other dominions have not taken similar,51
NA,"action. The Dominion of Canada, which",51
NA,"lies closer to the heart of the Empire,",51
NA,and could more readily spare a,51
NA,"Minister fov a few months, has not",51
NA,deemed it necessary to have a Besident,51
NA,Minister in London. The Government's,51
NA,proposal is a departure from established,51
NA,precedent. The honorable member for,51
NA,New England ( Mr Thompson) made a,51
NA,strong point when he urged that the,51
NA,electorate represented by the right hon-,51
NA,I orable member for Flinders had a right,51
NA,to be considered iu this matter. Per-,51
NA,"sonally, I have nothing against the right",51
NA,"honorable gentleman, but I entirely differ",51
NA,"from him on political matters, and",51
NA,I share the view of the honorable mem-,51
NA,ber for New England that the electors,51
NA,concerned should have been consulted.,51
NA,The right honorable gentleman conducted,51
NA,his campaign from abroad to a large,51
NA,"extent, and I feel sure that had the elec-",51
NA,"tors been told that, within a compara-",51
NA,tively short time of his election he would,51
NA,be sent as Besident Minister in London,51
NA,"fov a. period of two years, he would not",51
NA,"have been returned. Mr Collins, the",51
NA,"Official Secretary of Australia House,",51
NA,was appointed by the Government led by,51
NA,"the right honorable member for Flinders,",51
NA,and is well equipped to carry through,51
NA,successfully any loan conversion opera-,51
NA,tions that may be deemed necessary. The,51
NA,new Besident Minister will be obliged to,51
NA,wait until the London market is favor-,51
NA,"able, just as Mr Collins would have to",51
NA,"wait, had he been entrusted with the",51
NA,"mission. Some time ago, it was antici-",51
NA,pated that loan conversions on a large,51
NA,scale would take place. We were led to .,51
NA,believe that immediately upon his arrival,51
NA,in London the right honorable member,52
NA,for Minders would get in touch with,52
NA,financial interests and take steps to,52
NA,vert oar overseas debts into securities,52
NA,bearing a lower rate of interest. We are,52
NA,now advised that the only operation,52
NA,before Christmas will be the conversion,52
NA,"of the £ 13y000,000 due by the New South",52
NA,Wales Government.,52
Mr GREGORY ,Ther e will be another,52
NA,conversion next year.,52
Mr A GREEN ,Neithe r the honor-,52
NA,able member for Flinders ( Mr Bruce),52
NA,nor anybody else can foretell that next,52
NA,year will be more suitable than the,52
NA,present. He cannot do this job better,52
NA,"than it could be done by Mr Collins, and,",52
NA,as the proposed appointment involves an,52
NA,"entirely new departure, something with-",52
NA,out precedent in Australia or in any,52
NA,"other portion of the Empire, the Govern-",52
NA,ment will have to support it with stronger,52
NA,reasons than have yet been given to this,52
NA,House before it will be approved by the,52
NA,people. Even the Attorney-General ( Mr.,52
NA,Latham) has stated that he regards the,52
NA,proposed appointment as an experiment.,52
NA,The Leader of the Country party (Dr,52
NA,Earle Page) declared that he has,52
NA,advocated for years the appointment of,52
NA,a Besident Minister in London. He has,52
NA,"also advocated for years, without result,",52
NA,"the creation of new States, and,",52
NA,"apparently, will continue to do. so for",52
NA,many more years. The right honorable,52
NA,gentleman is fond of chasing a will-o'-the,52
NA,wisp. The reasons advanced by the,52
NA,Attorney-General cancel the arguments,52
NA,adduced by other supporters of the bill.,52
NA,We are told that the passage of the hill,52
NA,is necessary in order that the right honoreverybody.,52
NA,able member for Flinders may take con-,52
NA,trol of the staff at Australia House.,52
NA,Without this legislation he can still take,52
NA,charge of the staff while he is in Lon-,52
NA,"don, but I hope he will not remain abroad",52
NA,"for more than a few months, because the",52
NA,present Ministry is not over-rich in,52
NA,"ability, and i f the right honorable mem-",52
NA,ber for Flinders is as capable as his,52
NA,"friends have declared during this debate,",52
NA,his right place is in Australia. I can,52
NA,"see no justification for the bill, and the",52
NA,reason for its introduction is a mystery.,52
NA,Mr E. F. HARRISON (Bendigo),52
NA,[9.18] -I n answering some of the critiwhich,52
NA,cism that has been directed by members,52
NA,"of the Opposition against, the right hon-",52
NA,"orable member for Flinders ( Mr Bruce),",52
NA,con- I do not propose to follow them to the,52
NA,depths to which they descended. At the,52
NA,outset I wish to nail the oft-repeated lie,52
NA,that the right honorable member for,52
NA,Flinders was educated abroad and has no,52
NA,sympathy for Australia. He was born in,52
NA,Australia and received his school educa-,52
NA,tion here. At the outbreak of war he,52
NA,"was in England completing his education,",52
NA,and in order to avoid the loss of time,52
NA,that would be involved in returning to,52
NA,the Commonwealth to join up with the,52
NA,"Australian Expeditionary Force, he",52
NA,"enlisted in a British regiment, and while",52
NA,serving with it was gravely wounded.,52
NA,This bill has been introduced at,52
NA,"an opportune, time. Australia has",52
NA,experienced two years of serious depres-,52
NA,"sion, but now, because governments are",52
NA,restoring the country to a firm financial,52
NA,"footing, our credit overseas is so improved",52
NA,that an opportunity presents itself to,52
NA,reduce appreciably the interest payable,52
NA,on the external public debt. I f Austra-,52
NA,"lians are true to themselves, the New",52
NA,"South Wales loan of £13,000,000, which",52
NA,"will fall due in a few weeks, will probably",52
NA,"be converted at a lower rate of interest,",52
NA,which will represent a saving of between,52
NA,"£150,000 and £160,000 a year. I remind",52
NA,the House that large loans are not con-,52
NA,verted by merely publishing a notifica-,52
NA,tion in a newspaper. Careful negotia-,52
NA,tions are necessary between the financial,52
NA,houses and the representatives of the bor-,52
NA,rowing dominion. The doors of banks,52
NA,aud other financial institutions are,52
NA,"strongly guarded, and do not open to",52
NA,"I say nothing in"" disparage-",52
NA,"ment of Mr Collins, who has given extra-",52
NA,"ordinarily good service to Australia, but",52
NA,he has not access to those financial,52
NA,circles in which it is necessary to explain,52
NA,Australia's present situation and its pros-,52
NA,pects. A favorable impression in those,52
NA,circles is essential if we are to effect a,52
NA,conversion upon satisfactory conditions.,52
NA,In those circumstances it is fortunate that,52
NA,the High Commissionership is at present,52
NA,"vacant, through the expiration of Sir",52
NA,Granville Eyrie's term of office. This,52
NA,has enabled the right honorable member,52
NA,for Flinders to proceed from Ottawa to,52
NA,London to carry out an operation for,52
NA,the ground was most care-fully,52
NA,prepared by the Attorney-General ( Mr.,53
NA,Latham) on 'his recent visit abroad.,53
NA,Probably in connexion with the High,53
NA,Comniissionership alone a saving of,53
NA,"£2,000 a .year will be effected, and i f",53
NA,Resident Minister in London is able to,53
NA,effect the conversion of the maturing New,53
NA,South Wales loan upon improved con-,53
NA,"ditions, he will in one year save 70",53
NA,or 80 times his own salary. The,53
NA,present official secretary at Australia,53
NA,House has not been in the Commonwealth,53
NA,"for several years, and has no first-hand",53
NA,knowledge of the perils through - which,53
NA,Australia has recently passed. I f the,53
NA,"conversion operations are to be successful,",53
NA,we must have on the spot a man who can,53
NA,speak with authority and first-hand know-,53
NA,ledge. Who is better fitted for this,53
NA,critical task than the right honorahle,53
NA,"member for Flinders, who left Australia",53
NA,recently after taking an active aud,53
NA,prominent part in the public affairs of the,53
NA,"Commonwealth? Mr Collins, whom I",53
NA,"have known and esteemed for many years,",53
NA,is without up-to-date knowledge of Aus-,53
NA,"tralia's financial problems, and has not",53
NA,the authority and prestige which will be,53
NA,enjoyed by the right honorable member,53
NA,for Flinders. Whatever may be done,53
NA,for us by our representative in,53
NA,"London, our fate will be more or less in",53
NA,our own hands. I f we make fools of our-,53
NA,selves and follow false prophets who,53
NA,"would lead us to destruction, we shall not",53
NA,satisfactorily convert the overseas debt,53
NA,and reduce our interest bill. On us alone,53
NA,the success of the impending transactions,53
NA,"depends, and our mouthpiece will be the",53
NA,Resident Minister in London. His,53
NA,appointment has been described as a,53
NA,political plum. Having been very closely,53
NA,associated with him prior to his depar-,53
NA,"ture from Australia, I am able to say",53
NA,definitely that he did not desire to go,53
NA,"abroad, but went from a sense of public",53
NA,duty. The fact that this bill may be,53
NA,operative for two years does not neces-,53
NA,sarily mean that the right honorable mem-,53
NA,ber for Flinders will remain abroad for,53
NA,that period. Probably when he has com-,53
NA,pleted the task which has been delegated,53
NA,"to him, he will return to Australia, where",53
NA,his real interests are. But i f in order,53
NA,to complete his mission he should be re-,53
NA,quired to stay in London longer than he,53
NA,"originally contemplated, the bill will",53
NA,mit him to do so for two years aud no,53
NA,Mr E. W. Harrison.,53
NA,"longer. During his absence, which, I hope",53
NA,"for Australia's sake, will not extend to",53
NA,"two years, I shall ""attend to the work of",53
NA,his constituency. So far I have not heard,53
NA,the from any elector of Flinders criticism of,53
NA,the right honorable gentleman for having,53
NA,gone overseas in obedience to the call of,53
NA,"duty. Without exception, all of his con-",53
NA,stituents who have sj>oken or written to,53
NA,me have expressed pride and satisfaction,53
NA,in the fact that their representative has,53
NA,been chosen for this important task. I,53
NA,am convinced that upon his return not,53
NA,only will his electors express their,53
NA,approval of the service he has given to,53
NA,"Australia, but the people of the Common-",53
NA,wealth generally will be satisfied that the,53
NA,fruits of his mission have well justified,53
NA,the departure which this bill proposes.,53
NA,NA,53
NA,debate has reminded me of the saying,53
NA,"that a prophet is not without honour, save",53
NA,in his own coivntry. I predict that future,53
NA,generations will proudly refer to the right,53
NA,honorable member for Flinders ( Mr.,53
NA,Bruce) as a great Australian. Other,53
NA,public men of the past have been sub-,53
NA,"jected to similar criticism and attack, but",53
NA,to-day we honour them for their loyalty,53
NA,"to principle, their integrity, and their",53
NA,wisdom. Far too much debate has taken,53
NA,place on a comparatively simple proposal.,53
NA,I t is true that no appointment of the,53
NA,nature now proposed was ever previously,53
NA,"made in Australia, but the present",53
NA,financial situation is without precedent,53
NA,in Australian history. I have been recol-,53
NA,lecting the cabled correspondence between,53
NA,the then Prime Minister ( Mr Scullin),53
NA,when he was in Loudon and his colleagues,53
NA,in Australia in connexion with the pro-,53
NA,posal of the then Treasurer ( Mr.,53
NA,Theodore) to issue a fiduciary currency.,53
NA,Message after message came from the,53
NA,right honorable gentleman to warn,53
NA,Cabinet that i f this proposal were per-,53
NA,"sisted in, onr credit in London would be",53
NA,destroyed and Australia would be unable,53
NA,to meet its obligations. Amongst the,53
NA,members who have 3poken most dis-,53
NA,paragingly of the right honorable member,53
NA,for Flinders are some representing New,53
NA,South Wales. Yet the conversion of a,53
NA,debt of that State will be the first and,53
NA,most urgent problem to be tackled by the,53
NA,Resident Minister in London. The,53
NA,per- character of the right honorable member,53
NA,for Flinders has been disparagingly,53
NA,referred to. The right honorable member,54
NA,"is persona grata in any company, no",54
NA,"matter how high it might be, either in",54
NA,England or in Australia. I f any commer-,54
NA,cial concern had an important mission to,54
NA,"accomplish, would it not select for the",54
NA,pose a person who was acceptable every-,54
NA,"where, and who thoroughly understood",54
NA,the business? I n this case the Govern-,54
NA,ment is not incurring additional expendi-,54
NA,ture. I differ from those who say that,54
NA,the right honorable member for Flinders,54
NA,is in any way anti-Australian. I have,54
NA,sat in the Commonwealth Parliament for,54
NA,as long a period as the right honorable,54
NA,"gentleman, and can say of him that I",54
NA,have not met one whose integrity or,54
NA,"chivalry was higher than his. I , as an",54
NA,"Australian, am glad to have been asso-",54
NA,ciated with an Australian of his type.,54
NA,I believe! that he will render inestimable,54
NA,"service to the Commonwealth, and that in",54
NA,no sense will he let Australia down. I,54
NA,cannot understand how the idea has,54
NA,occurred to the minds of some persons,54
NA,"that, the right honorable gentleman was",54
NA,"an ti-Australian a,t Ottawa. I should have",54
NA,been pleased had he given way a little,54
NA,more to the Mother Country in order to,54
NA,obtain for Australia a greater measure of,54
NA,reciprocity.,54
NA,Much has been said regarding the neces-,54
NA,sity for saving money. I f we were to,54
NA,calculate the cost involved in the discus-,54
NA,"sion of this matter, we would realize how",54
NA,much could have been saved had it been,54
NA,debated on its merits.,54
NA,NA,54
NA,right honorable member for Flinders ( Mr.,54
NA,Bruce) ought to feel flattered at the attenlivered,54
NA,tion that has been paid to him during,54
NA,the course of this debate. Most of the,54
NA,"speeches have been purely partisan, and",54
NA,those who have opposed the proposal of,54
NA,the Government have made out a very,54
NA,poor case.,54
NA,The point has been made that this is,54
NA,a departure from established practice. I,54
NA,"remind honorable members, however, that",54
NA,the subject was discussed at the Imperial,54
NA,"Conference that was held in 1925 or 1926,",54
NA,"when it was decided that, in the near",54
NA,"future, each of the governments there",54
NA,represented should have a Besident,54
NA,Minister in London. I am in favour of,54
NA,"this step, because I believe that one who",54
NA,has had experience in the Cabinet must,54
NA,have a thorough grasp of Australian,54
NA,affairs. Australia is the first of the,54
NA,"dominions to take this step, and I believe",54
NA,"that, in thus acting, we are serving the",54
NA,best interests of the Commonwealth. The,54
NA,pur- honorable member for East Sydney ( Mr.,54
NA,Ward) has decried the right honorable,54
NA,member for Flinders; but I consider that,54
NA,"he is the right man in the right place, and",54
NA,I hope that he will continue to work,54
NA,on Australia's behalf in London for some,54
NA,time to come. One of his first duties,54
NA,will be to arrange for the conversion of,54
NA,"the New South Wales £13,000,000 loan,",54
NA,and I feel confident that he will bring,54
NA,that operation to a successful issue.,54
Mr HOLLOWAY ,Melbourne Ports),54
NA,[9.40] - I regret that the tone of this,54
NA,debate has been so considerably lowered,54
NA,since it was initiated. I cannot find in,54
NA,the bill any reference to either the right,54
NA,honorable member for Flinders ( Mr.,54
NA,"Bruce), or any other person. I hope",54
NA,that the personal element will be kept out,54
NA,of the discussion.,54
NA,I n fairness to the Leader of the Opposi-,54
NA,"tion ( Mr Scullin), may I point but that",54
NA,he did not oppose Mr Bruce's remaining,54
NA,in London for the period necessary to com-,54
NA,"plete the pending loan conversion; but,",54
NA,"as a matter of fact, suggested that that",54
NA,was a wise course to adopt. The real,54
NA,principle has been cleverly side-tracked,54
NA,by some of the professional debaters,54
NA,"in the House who, as the Minister has",54
NA,"pointed out, have put up a straw man",54
NA,merely for the purpose of knocking it,54
NA,down. The honorable member for Gipps-,54
NA,NA,54
NA,"an excellent speech, probably the",54
NA,most logical to which we have listened;,54
NA,"but he made it on wrong premises, be-",54
NA,cause he focussed attention on the wisdom,54
NA,of allowing a Minister to remain in,54
NA,London until the loan conversion opera-,54
NA,tion was completed. Not a single mem-,54
NA,ber has opposed that. I have listened to,54
NA,"every speaker, and have not heard one",54
NA,object to the right honorable member for,54
NA,Flinders remaining in London for the,54
NA,purpose of effecting a reduction in the,54
NA,interest on our overseas indebtedness.,54
NA,My only complaint is that that problem,54
NA,was not tackled long ago. I have acci-,54
NA,dentally come across a speech that was,54
NA,delivered in the House of Commons in,54
NA,April last by Sir Bobert Home. He,54
NA,did uor. suggest that Australia would be,55
NA,"-acting in an undignified manner, i f it",55
NA,.sought a reduction in the rates of interest.,55
NA,.He pointed out to the members of tlie,55
NA,. House of Commons that Australia could,55
NA,-not possibly meet her obligations i f Eng-,55
NA,lqnd remained any longer on the gold,55
NA,"-standard, and said that it was almost",55
NA,-criminal to suggest that the smaller coun-,55
NA,"tries, the new countries, the primary",55
NA,"producing countries, including Aus-",55
NA,"tralia, should be expected to meet",55
NA,their obligations unless prices were,55
NA,"increased, and there was a depar-",55
NA,ture from the almost criminal prac-,55
NA,tice of making debtor countries pay twice,55
NA,as much as they borrowed. He further,55
NA,.said tbat instead of the people of Great,55
NA,Britain taking a hostile view of a sug-,55
NA,gestion by Australia that repayment of,55
NA,loans should be postponed or that interest,55
NA,"* rates should be lowered, they almost wel-",55
NA,comed such overtures. Yet this matter,55
NA,has been held up here because of party,55
NA,"political differences, and meanwhile, Aus-",55
NA,tralia has been suffering.,55
NA,I agree with the Leader of the,55
NA,Opposition that . the right honorable,55
NA,member for Flinders should be allowed,55
NA,to complete the pending loan conversion;,55
NA,hut I and the Opposition as a,55
NA,body are opposed to the principle,55
NA,of having a Minister permanently,55
NA,"resident in London. That,",55
NA,"consider, is an honest attitude to adopt.",55
NA,"[, and the school of thought to which I",55
NA,"belong, believe that there is danger in",55
NA,Australia being governed according to,55
NA,expert outside advice. We are suffering,55
NA,to-day as a result of the acceptance of the,55
NA,advice of supposed experts who have,55
NA,visited Australia during the last four or,55
NA,five years. A.ustria like,55
NA,and many other small,55
NA,also is suffering as a consequence,55
NA,of the acceptance of the advice of,55
NA,"financial experts, particularly in Great",55
NA,Britain. The advice that they gave,55
NA,three or four years ago is now obsolete in,55
NA,"Great Britain, and is entirely contrary to",55
NA,the opinions of the experts of to-day.,55
NA,T object to the way in which the debate,55
NA,has been conducted. It has been turned,55
NA,to new premises altogether. The Opposi-,55
NA,tion has been charged with being opposed,55
NA,to the loan conversion operations. Hon-,55
NA,orable members supporting the Govern-,55
NA,or. Holloway.,55
NA,ment have even pointed out the amount,55
NA,of money that would be saved by these,55
NA,"operations, as i f the Opposition were all",55
NA,centred upon not allowing the Minister,55
NA,to remain in London to carry on that,55
NA,work. Actually We are opposed to this,55
NA,bill becausewe think that by allowing a,55
NA,Commonwealth Minister to be per-,55
NA,"manently resident in Loudon, we shall",55
NA,add to the danger of this country being,55
NA,controlled from overseas.,55
NA,Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth),55
NA,[9.46] -Wit h the honorable member for,55
NA,"Melbourne Ports ( Mr Holloway), I de-",55
NA,"plore the tone that, has crept into this",55
NA,debate. I t seems to me that we should,55
NA,endeavour to help Australia in this time,55
NA,"of depression, not only by giving due",55
NA,"consideration to the problems that beset, us",55
NA,"but also by aiding the Resident, Minister",55
NA,in London to arrange a successful con-,55
NA,version loan. The tone that has been,55
NA,adopted in this debate may considerably,55
NA,"embarrass the conversion of that loan,",55
NA,"because, instead of the Resident Minister",55
NA,receiving the wholehearted support of this,55
NA,House in his efforts-to secure the con-,55
NA,"version of the loan, accusations are being",55
NA,levelled at him by the Opposition that,55
NA,will embarrass him. Notwithstanding,55
NA,the statement of the honorable member,55
NA,for Melbourne Ports that no objection is,55
NA,being taken to the proposal that the Resi-,55
NA,I dent Minister should remain in London,55
NA,until such time as the conversion is accom-,55
NA,"plished, some honorable members object,",55
NA,to the appointment of a Resident Minister,55
NA,in London at all. They seem to resent the,55
NA,fact that tbe right honorable member for,55
NA,Flinders ( Mr Bruce) is to represent Aus-,55
NA,tralia abroad. The honorable member,55
NA,"for Melbourne Ports suggests that, this",55
NA,"will be a permanent appointment, but I",55
NA,Australia refer him to the provision in the bill,55
NA,countries which states that it shall remain in opera-,55
NA,tion for a period of two years and no,55
NA,longer. The position of Resident Minis-,55
NA,"ter in London, therefore, cannot be con-",55
NA,sidered as permanent.,55
Mr MAXWELL ,I t is purely experi-,55
NA,mental.,55
NA,Mr E. J. HARRISON -Tha t being,55
NA,"so, the arguments of the Opposition can-",55
NA,not be substantiated. The honorable mem-,55
NA,ber for East Sydney ( Mr Ward) said,55
NA,that the debate has centred round the,55
NA,name of the right honorable member for,55
NA,"Flinders, and not the bill itself. The",56
NA,general tone of the speeches from the,56
NA,Opposition suggest that in tlieir opinion,56
NA,".he has an. anti-Australian outlook, but",56
NA,"I , for one, certainly prefer the outlook of",56
NA,-.the right honorable member for Flinders,56
NA,"to that of ""members of the Lang party who",56
NA,represent a group of persons who have no,56
NA,claim at all to be considered as Aus-,56
NA,tralians. I t is a wise move at this stage,56
NA,"have a Resident Minister in London, i f",56
NA,only to convince the people there that we,56
NA,in Australia have a national outlook and a,56
NA,-clear understanding of international ques-,56
NA,tions. Reference has been made to the edu-,56
NA,cational qualifications of the right honor-,56
NA,able member for Flinders. I t is wise,56
NA,that we should select such a member as,56
NA,"our representative, mainly because of",56
NA,"those qualifications since, at least, they",56
NA,have given him a breadth of vision and,56
NA,"sportsmanship, that cannot be claimed to",56
NA,-be possessed by those who now attack,56
NA,him. Had he no other qualification than,56
NA,the fact that he was instrumental in bring-,56
NA,ing about the fall of the Lang Govern-,56
NA,"ment, it would be sufficient to establish",56
NA,his status in the eyes of oversea financiers.,56
NA,The members of the-Opposit ion have pro-,56
NA,fessed to show great consideration for,56
NA,the constituents of the right honorable,56
NA,"member for Flinders, whom, they say, are",56
NA,likely to be disfranchised while he re-,56
NA,mains overseas. Let me suggest that they,56
NA,should rather watch their interests in,56
NA,"their own constituencies, because their",56
NA,"positions in this House may, in the near",56
NA,"future, be seriously jeopardized, because",56
NA,of the attempts they have made by mis-,56
NA,chievous statements to prevent the suc-,56
NA,cessful conversion of the loan.,56
Mr GREGORY ,Swan) [9.53] - I,56
NA,support the bill. At no time since the,56
NA,war has it been so necessary as i t is to-day,56
NA,to have a responsible Minister resident,56
NA,in London. The confidence of oversea,56
NA,investors in Australia is being gradually,56
NA,"restored. I n November, loans amounting",56
NA,"to £13j000,000 have to be converted.",56
NA,"Some heavy loans are maturing next year,",56
NA,and there is the probability of a big con-,56
NA,version taking place. We could not have,56
NA,chosen any more suitable person for the,56
NA,position of Resident Minister in London,56
NA,than the right honorable member for,56
NA,Flinders ( Mr Brace). I cannot under-,56
NA,stand the attitude of the Leader of the,56
NA,"Opposition ( Mr Scullin), who has con-",56
NA,tended that the work of conversion should,56
NA,"be left entirely to Mr Collins, our princi-",56
NA,pal officer in London. What would the,56
NA,Opposition have to say i f the Govern-,56
NA,ment failed to ensure the success of the,56
NA,conversion loan by neglecting to send a,56
NA,capable representative overseas?,56
Mr MARTENS ,Th e Leader of the,56
NA,to Opposition did not say that the conver-,56
NA,sion should be left entirely in the hands,56
NA,of Mr Collins.,56
Mr GREGORY ,Th e Leader of the,56
NA,Opposition said that this matter could,56
NA,"well be left in thehands of Mr Collins,",56
NA,and that there was no necessity for this,56
NA,appointment. I have nothing but con-,56
NA,tempt for honorable members who have,56
NA,attacked the right honorable member for,56
NA,Flinders. I am entirely opposed to the,56
NA,permanent appointment of a Minister in,56
NA,London. That would hardly be a wise,56
NA,"procedure, in view of the great distance",56
NA,to the Old Country. I f I thought that,56
NA,the object of the Government was to make,56
NA,"this position jiernianent, I should pro-",56
NA,"test against the bill, but I do not believe",56
NA,that that is the desire of the Government.,56
NA,"I hope that, in the near future, the Besi-",56
NA,"dent Minister in London, will be able to",56
NA,make such financial arrangements there,56
NA,as will permit him to return to this,56
NA,country. We should not appoint a poli-,56
NA,tician to the position of High Commis-,56
NA,sioner. We must encourage trade and,56
NA,business enterprise. Instead of appoint-,56
NA,"ing some one from our political ranks,",56
NA,we should appoint a business man who,56
NA,would be able to inspire confidence in,56
NA,"the British commercial world, and to",56
NA,stimulate our trading relations with Great,56
NA,Britain and Europe in general. I should,56
NA,like embodied in the bill a provision to,56
NA,the effect that no member of Parliament,56
NA,should be eligible for such a position until,56
NA,at least eighteen months after he had,56
NA,ceased to be a member. We can best,56
NA,build up our-export trade by appointing,56
NA,the most suitable representative overseas.,56
NA,I hope that the Government will give con-,56
NA,"sideration to my suggestion, particularly",56
NA,"in respect to, not only the High Cornmis-",56
NA,"sionership, but also to appointments to",56
NA,the High Court.,56
Mr ROSEVEAR ,Dalley) [9.58] -,56
NA,"The bill, although short, has some pecu-",56
NA,liar features. The main argument of,56
NA,Ministers in support of this measure is,57
NA,that the appointment of a Resident,57
NA,Minister in London will enable us to have,57
NA,"a better understanding of foreign policy,",57
NA,will give us a first-hand opportunity to,57
NA,"convert loans that are falling due, and",57
NA,will probably enable us to secure a reduc-,57
NA,tion in the rate of interest on the money,57
NA,that we owe abroad. I am not very much,57
NA,concerned about sending a Resident,57
NA,Minister to London to enable him to,57
NA,become better acquainted with foreign,57
NA,policy. The further we keep away,57
NA,from the countries which breed inter-,57
NA,national difficulties the better for Aus-,57
NA,tralia. We are quite close enough,57
NA,to the intrigues of Europe,57
NA,out sending Ministers abroad in an,57
NA,endeavour to participate in them. One,57
NA,argument used in the debate is that be-,57
NA,cause we have always had a High Commis-,57
NA,"sioner, we should appoint' either a High",57
NA,Commissioner or a Resident Minister in,57
NA,London. It has also been argued by the,57
NA,supporters of the bill that this position,57
NA,has always been filled by a political dead-,57
NA,"head. Evidently, past governments have",57
NA,appointed political dead-heads to this,57
NA,position in London in the belief that,57
NA,they would adequately represent Aus-,57
NA,tralia. Yet it is now claimed that we must,57
NA,send a first-class Minister abroad to take,57
NA,up the cudgels on behalf of the people of,57
NA,Australia. There is not the slightest,57
NA,doubt that the right honorable member,57
NA,for Flinders is a capable Minister.,57
NA,The right honorable member for Flinders,57
NA,overshadows every other member of the,57
NA,Ministry. It was evident while he was in,57
NA,Australia that he dominated the Cabinet,57
NA,and the party of which he is a member.,57
NA,I have not the slightest doubt that when,57
NA,he is abroad he will also continue to domi- from the people.,57
NA,"nate the Government, and that the real",57
NA,Government of the Commonwealth will,57
NA,be transferred from Australia to England.,57
NA,The question of whether it will be diffi-,57
NA,cult to convert Australia's overseas in-,57
NA,debtedness is one on which there appears,57
NA,to be a difference of opinion. Our over-,57
NA,seas indebtedness will be converted,57
NA,regardless of whether the right honorable,57
NA,member for Flinders is or is not in,57
NA,London. The time is rapidly approach-,57
NA,ing when overseas bondholders will have,57
NA,no alternative but to agree to a conversion,57
NA,of their holdings at reduced rates of,57
NA,Mr Rosevear.,57
NA,interest. There is nothing extraordinary,57
NA,associated with the conversion of loans.,57
NA,There have been two remarkable instances,57
NA,of successful conversions since the ter-,57
NA,mination of the war. The conversion of,57
NA,Great Britain's Avar debt to the United,57
NA,States of America was arranged Avithout,57
NA,the assistance of a resident minister in,57
NA,Washington. That conversion Avas effected,57
NA,not because America's regard for the,57
NA,"mighty dollar had lessened, but be-",57
NA,cause America's capitalists realized,57
NA,that Great Britain could not continue to,57
NA,pay the interest that was then being,57
NA,charged. For precisely the same reason,57
NA,the Government of this country forced,57
NA,"witha conversion loan upon local bondholders,",57
NA,but at the same time it alloAA'ed the over-,57
NA,seas -bondholders to go scot-free.,57
NA,Eighteen months ago Ave advocated a,57
NA,policy of interest reduction Avhich,57
NA,"honorable members opposite denounced,",57
NA,but which this Government now,57
NA,supports. We realizedit Avas im-,57
NA,possible to continue to pay the present,57
NA,rate of interest on our overseas debt. Hon-,57
NA,orable members opposite who called it,57
NA,repudiation at that time now have,57
NA,to admit that a conversion is absolutely,57
NA,necessary i f Australia is to carry on. I f,57
NA,our suggestions had been adopted,57
NA,eighteen months ago the amount repre-,57
NA,"senting the difference between, our revenue",57
NA,and our interest payments would,57
NA,have been sufficient to provide em-,57
NA,ployment for the hundreds of thousands,57
NA,of our unfortunate fellowmen who,57
NA,are now walking the streets in,57
NA,search of Avork. The policy of this,57
NA,"Government has led it into difficulties,",57
NA,and i t is now endeavouring to recover its,57
NA,position by demanding further sacrifices,57
NA,The overseas bond-,57
NA,"holders, as well as the Government,",57
NA,realize the actual position. The serA'ices,57
NA,"of a High Commissioner, a Besident",57
NA,"Minister, or any other representative in",57
NA,"London, Avill not be needed to bring about",57
NA,conversion of our overseas indebtedness.,57
NA,Our loans will be converted; there is no,57
NA,doubt about that. The rates of interest,57
NA,may not be at the figure that the GoAern-,57
NA,r,57
NA,"ment desires, but they will be governed",57
NA,by what the bondholders consider is the,57
NA,"country's capacity to pay, as was the",57
NA,case in the conversion of Great Britain's,57
NA,war debt to America. The rates eventually,57
NA,fixed will be such that the people of Aus-,58
NA,tralia will have to keep their nose to the,58
NA,grindstone for many years to come. The,58
NA,"Government, which is now forced to face",58
NA,"the facts, should have done what is now",58
NA,proposed eighteen months ago. A reduc-,58
NA,tion in overseas interest will be one of,58
NA,greatest factors in solving Australia's,58
NA,present difficulties. There is no need to,58
NA,appoint a Resident Minister in Loudon,58
NA,to arrange a conversion; the bondholders,58
NA,"will be forced to convert, but it will be",58
NA,at a figure closely approximating the,58
NA,country's capacity to pay.,58
Mr BERNARD CORSER ,Wide Bay),58
NA,[10.5] -I t is not my intention to pro-,58
NA,long the debate by repeating the argu-,58
NA,"ments that have been advanced, by some",58
NA,honorable members opposite; but their,58
NA,bitter references to the right honorable,58
NA,"member for Flinders ( Mr Bruce), who,",58
NA,"they presume, is to be appointed Besident",58
NA,"Minister in London under this bill,",58
NA,cannot be allowed to pass unchal-,58
NA,lenged. I feel quite sure that honorable,58
NA,members opposite do not really believe,58
NA,half of what they have said concerning,58
NA,the right honorable member. Bather do,58
NA,"they recognize his ability, value and in-",58
NA,fluence; it is their fear of him politically,58
NA,that has impelled them to make,58
NA,the statements they have made. They,58
NA,are anxious to harass the Govern-,58
NA,"ment of which he is a member, and to",58
NA,endeavour to destroy his influence and,58
NA,"power, which have been of great value to",58
NA,Australia. For party political reasons,58
NA,they have attempted to belittle the right,58
NA,honorable member in the eyes of Aus-,58
NA,tralians. The bill is to amend the High,58
NA,"Commissioner's Act, hy making provision",58
NA,for the appointment in Great Britain of,58
NA,a Minister or a commissioner authorized,58
NA,by the Executive Council or the Governor-,58
NA,General. I t does not provide that the,58
NA,functions of the Besident Minister shall,58
NA,be confined to converting our overseas,58
NA,indebtedness; but i t is apparent that one,58
NA,of his most important duties will be the,58
NA,handling of a big conversion loan. I,58
NA,contend that there is no one in Australia,58
NA,more likely to secure a better hearing,58
NA,from Great Britain's financiers than,58
NA,the right honorable member for Flinders,58
NA,in his efforts to convert Australia's,58
NA,overseas debt ' of approximately,58
NA,"€580,000,000. I t has been suggested",58
NA,by honorable members opposite that,58
NA,all the work needed could be com-,58
NA,"pleted within one year, and that there is",58
NA,uo necessity to appoint a Minister for,58
NA,two years. There is nothing in the bill,58
NA,tocompel the Minister appointed to,58
NA,the remain in London for two years i f there,58
NA,"is not sufficient for him to do; but, in",58
NA,view of the highly important duties which,58
NA,"he will have to perform, the term provided",58
NA,is not unreasonable. The Besident Minister,58
NA,"is to act as High Commissioner, andinthat",58
NA,capacity will be expected to use his ability,58
NA,in increasing trade between Great Britain,58
NA,and Australia. London is still the finan-,58
NA,"cial and commercial centre of the world,*",58
NA,notwithstanding that other countries have,58
NA,much larger populations. Every nation,58
NA,of any importance has its ambassador in,58
NA,"London, and it is with these that our",58
NA,Minister will confer with a view to secur-,58
NA,ing new treaties and new markets for,58
NA,the products of our primary industries.,58
NA,The United States of America is,58
NA,"represented in London by an ex-Treasurer,",58
NA,and it is only right that the Common-,58
NA,wealth should have the most able represen-,58
NA,tative in Great Britain for at least,58
NA,the term provided in ' the bill. Such a,58
NA,"representative can negotiate treaties,",58
NA,"extend our trade, confer with the repre-",58
NA,"sentatives of other nations, and generally",58
NA,act in the interests of the Australian,58
NA,people. I am sure that whether the,58
NA,duties which fall upon the shoulders' of,58
NA,the right honorable member for Flinders,58
NA,relate to the conversion of our overseas,58
NA,"indebtedness, the carrying out of services",58
NA,usually rendered hy the High Commis-,58
NA,"sioner, or the negotiating of trade agree-",58
NA,"ments, they will be discharged with dig-",58
NA,nity and honour to himself and with,58
NA,credit and benefit to Australia. A l l who,58
NA,are prepared to give honour where honour,58
NA,is due will admit that the right honor-,58
NA,"ablemember for Flinders has, through-",58
NA,"out his public life, endeavoured to do",58
NA,"the best he could for Australia, and has",58
NA,rendered this country invaluable service.,58
NA,I t has been argued that the appoint-,58
NA,"ment should not be made, because it"" will",58
NA,mean that the electors of Flinders would,58
NA,be left without parliamentary representa-,58
NA,"tion. I consider, however, that these",58
NA,electors are being honoured in the highest,58
NA,"degree, for no other honorable member",58
NA,of this Parliament will be entrusted,58
NA,with such important aud responsible,59
NA,duties in relation to-our financial and,59
NA,commercial operations. I believe that,59
NA,"the electors of Flinders will realize this,",59
NA,and will be proud that their representa-,59
NA,tive has been honoured by appointment,59
NA,as the Resident Minister in London.,59
Mr RIORDAN ,Kennedy) [10.12] -,59
NA,1 am interested to learn that the right,59
NA,houorable member for Flinders ( Mr.,59
NA,Bruce) has already been selected as,59
NA,Resident Minister in London. I thought,59
NA,that perhaps the right honorable member,59
NA,"for North Sydney ( Mr Hughes), who",59
NA,.represented this country abroad in the,59
NA,"critical years between 1914 and 1918,",59
NA,might have been chosen. I t is to be,59
NA,hoped that the right honorable member,59
NA,for Flinders will live up to the high hopes,59
NA,that have been expressed in relation to,59
NA,"him this evening. Australia has, in the",59
NA,"past, borrowed heavily abroad.",59
NA,overseas indebtedness considerably ex-,59
NA,"ceeds £500,000,000. I t was not neces-",59
NA,"sary to appoint, a Resident Minister",59
NA,"overseas to raise this money. Australia,",59
NA,"in the past, has been able to borrow",59
NA,money as and when she desired it at the,59
NA,"market rates. I n the last year or two,",59
NA,we have had a financial expert abroad to,59
NA,watch the interests of the Commonwealth.,59
NA,"Mr Collins, who formerly filled the chief",59
NA,"position in the Commonwealth Treasury,",59
NA,is a financial adviser to the Govern-,59
NA,ment. I f a Resident Minister is,59
NA,"appointed overseas, and given the duty",59
NA,of watching Australia's interests in,59
NA,regard to conversion operations and other,59
NA,"financial transactions, it would appear",59
NA,to be unnecessary to keep Mr Collins,59
NA,there. Will the Nivison Group also,59
NA,continue to advise the Commonwealth,59
NA,Government in financial matters after the,59
NA,right honorable member for Flinders,59
NA,assumes his new duties? This right,59
NA,"honorable gentleman, we are told, has the",59
NA,facts of our financial business at his,59
NA,"finger tips, and is a financial expert",59
NA,"of the highest calibre. I hope, there-",59
NA,"fore, that we shall not duplicate ser-",59
NA,vices by allowing Mr Collins to remain,59
NA,in London while Mr Bruce is doing the,59
NA,work.,59
NA,The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr.,59
NA,SfiiUin) said this afternoon that he was,59
NA,opposed to the principle of the appoint-,59
NA,ment of a Resident Minister overseas. I t,59
NA,was then said that it would not be neces-,59
NA,sary for the right honorable member for,59
NA,Flinders to remain in London until the,59
NA,last document had been signed. What,59
NA,loans will have to be converted this finan-,59
NA,"cial year? We know that £13,000,000,",59
NA,borrowed by New South Wales will have,59
NA,"to be converted, but this State, and other",59
NA,"States as well, have, in the past, con-",59
NA,ducted their own conversion operations,59
NA,"satisfactorily. Money, like every other",59
NA,"commodity, is available at market rates,",59
NA,"independent of the personality, pleasing",59
NA,"mannerisms, or method of approach, of",59
NA,"individuals. I n fact, a man who can",59
NA,"tell the best story is, by common consent,",59
NA,the one who needs watching most care-,59
NA,"fully, for he is the most dangerous. The",59
NA,straightforward honest man usually has,59
NA,a definite proposition to submit to his,59
NA,creditors. Men who have no such pro-,59
NA,position have need to tell a good story.,59
NA,"Out- These are usually the people who, to use",59
NA,"an Australian phrase, ""bite you."" Aus-",59
NA,"tralia will, doubtless, be able to get what",59
NA,money she needs at market rates at the,59
NA,time the conversion has to be effected.,59
NA,"We well remember that in 1920, the",59
NA,Queensland Government found it neces-,59
NA,"sary to convert two loans, one of",59
NA,"£12,000,000, and the other of £10,000,000,",59
NA,butthe Commonwealth Nationalist Go-,59
NA,vernment did its utmost to render con-,59
NA,version operations impossible unless the,59
NA,Queensland Government undertook to,59
NA,grant an extension of leases to certain,59
NA,pastoral lessees. Is it now proposed that,59
NA,the Resident Minister in London shall,59
NA,be in a position to barter?,59
NA,There would have been very little dis-,59
NA,cussion on this bill had the Prime Minis-,59
NA,ter given us sufficient information when,59
NA,he introduced it. A l l he said was that,59
NA,the appointment was to be made for two,59
NA,"years, but might be extended. We know",59
NA,very well that once a new principle is,59
NA,established it is very difficult to abrogate,59
NA,it. Whenever appointments such .as that,59
NA,"now contemplated are made, the appoin-",59
NA,tee takes all possible steps to consolidate,59
NA,"his position. Usually, he begins by",59
NA,building up a big staff around him.,59
NA,There are already indications of that in,59
NA,this connexion. Expenditure is also in-,59
NA,"curred in regard to housing, and that,",59
NA,"too, has happened in this case. At a",59
NA,"time like this, when .the country is taxed",59
NA,"to the utmost, aud the call is for economy,",60
NA,we should economize at the top. I f we,60
NA,"cut the roots of a tree often enough,",60
NA,"we shall destroy the tree, whereas by",60
NA,ping its branches we improve it. When,60
NA,I recall that loans amounting to over,60
NA,"£500,000,000 have to. be converted over-",60
NA,"seas,"" I am reminded that not many",60
NA,months ago a voluntary conversion took,60
NA,"place in Australia. I t was, however,",60
NA,"voluntary only in name, because those who",60
NA,did not convert their holdings voluntarily,60
NA,were compelled to do so. The Australian,60
NA,"bondholder, as well as the man who fought",60
NA,"in the Great War, has made his sacrifice.",60
NA,"The London money market is improving,",60
NA,and to-day money is cheaper than it has,60
NA,been for some time. Other countries are,60
NA,"obtaining loans at low rates of interest,",60
NA,"and Australia, which has been a good",60
NA,"customer of Great Britain, and has met",60
NA,"all its obligations in the past, can look",60
NA,forward to renewing its loans at the ruling,60
NA,rate of interest. Since money lenders are,60
NA,not renowned for lending money for,60
NA,"reasons of sympathy, the Resident",60
NA,Minister in London will have to barter,60
NA,with them in the same way that he and,60
NA,his colleagues bartered at Ottawa by,60
NA,giving away Australia's -industries. The,60
NA,honorable member for Forrest ( Mr.,60
NA,Prowse) regretted that we did not give,60
NA,away more at Ottawa than we did. Our,60
NA,export trade in mutton has been limited,60
NA,by the Ottawa agreement to such an,60
NA,"extent that Australia is in a"" more un-",60
NA,favorable position than before. What has,60
NA,this country received as a result of the,60
NA,Ottawa Conference?,60
Mr CAMERON ,W e do not. know yet.,60
Mr RIORDAN ,"W e ought to know,",60
NA,because the country will have to foot the,60
NA,bill.,60
Mr DEIN ,Wha t has all this to do,60
NA,with the bill?,60
Mr RIORDAN ,Al l these things have,60
NA,to do with the appointment of a Resident,60
NA,Minister overseas. The right honorable,60
NA,"member for Flinders, whom I recognize",60
NA,"is an outstanding personality, although",60
NA,"in London, will continue to dictate the",60
NA,policy of this country. But he in turn,60
NA,will have to submit to dictation by those,60
NA,who dictated the policy agreed to at,60
NA,Ottawa. The gentleman who will control,60
NA,our destiny did not enjoy the confidence,60
NA,of his party sufficiently to obtain full,60
NA,ministerial rank. Surely there is some,60
NA,inconsistency opposite. I f the right,60
NA,honorable member for Flinders has such,60
NA,"lop- outstanding ability, why did the United",60
NA,Australia party first place him in a,60
NA,"subordinate position, and then, at the first",60
NA,"opportunity, shanghai him overseas? I",60
NA,was pleased to hear the honorable member,60
NA,for Bendigo ( Mr E. F. Harrison) say,60
NA,that he would look after the electors in,60
NA,the Flinders electorate during the absence,60
NA,of their representative. In order to serve,60
NA,"the interests of Flinders, the honorable",60
NA,member is prepared to neglect the,60
NA,interests of Bendigo. Were he really con-,60
NA,cerned about the best interests of the,60
NA,"people whom he represents, he would fight",60
NA,"for the continuation of the gold bounty,",60
NA,with a view to reviving the gold-mining,60
NA,"industry in his district. I n my opinion,",60
NA,the principle of government from London,60
NA,"ia bad, but i f it is necessary to have a",60
NA,"Resident Minister in Britain, why not",60
NA,"have one also iu Japan, and China, and,",60
NA,"indeed, in every country with which we",60
NA,do business? What has beeu said to-day,60
NA,about the right honorable member for,60
NA,Flinders has been said in the past of Sir,60
NA,"Granville Ryrie, Mr Andrew Fisher, Sir",60
NA,"Joseph Cook, Mr Devereux, and",60
NA,others. I am not deceived by these words,60
NA,of praise. Australia .should be represented,60
NA,"in Britain, not by politicians, but by men",60
NA,trained in the commercial world. Half,60
NA,a dozen commercial travellers in London,60
NA,would do more good for Australia than,60
NA,could be achieved hy the same number,60
NA,"of politicians, who would only pile up",60
NA,expenses.,60
Mr BAKER ,Oxley) [10.29] - I asso-,60
NA,ciate myself with those who have,60
NA,expressed their opposition to this bill!,60
NA,The House has been given scanty informa-,60
NA,tion as to the purpose of the measure.,60
NA,I f honorable members on this side have,60
NA,criticized the qualifications of the gentle-,60
NA,man whom it is suggested shall carry out,60
NA,"the duties of High Commissioner, the",60
NA,"responsibility lies with the Government,",60
NA,which appears to be basing its case upon,60
NA,the abilities of the suggested appointee.,60
NA,While Prime Minister of Australia he,60
NA,showed remarkable ability in concealing,60
NA,the fact that he possessed any. The chief,60
NA,memory that we have of him is that he,60
NA,took over from the Hughes Government,60
NA,"a surplus in the vicinity of £7,000,000",60
NA,and bequeathed to his successor i n office,61
NA,"a deficit of £6,500,000.",61
NA,Another reason which probably actuates,61
NA,the Government in this appointment is,61
NA,that the position of the Prime Minister,61
NA,is similar to that of the individual men-,61
NA,"tioned i n Pope's poem, who, like the",61
NA,"Turk, could "" bear no brother near the",61
NA,"throne"". I n this instance, i t also suits",61
NA,the right honorable member f o r Flinders.,61
NA,"On the one hand, i t removes a dangerous",61
NA,"rival, and on the other i t enables the",61
NA,person concerned to pay a good deal of,61
NA,attention to his private business over-,61
NA,seas.,61
Mr LANE , W h y cannot the honorable,61
NA,member be fair?,61
NA,Mr BAKER . ' - I am f a i r . I shall,61
NA,quote f r o m a journal which cannot be,61
NA,accused of being unsympathetically dis-,61
NA,posed towards the Nationalist member f o r,61
NA,Flinders or the Nationalist party. M y,61
NA,reading is f r o m the Melbourne Argus of,61
NA,"the 23rd December, 1931, and is as f o l -",61
NA,lows :-,61
NA,"I t is possible tliat Mr Bruce, notwith-",61
NA,standing his long experience both as Prime,61
NA,Minister and Treasurer and his prestige over-,61
NA,"seas, will not be a member of the Ministry at",61
NA,"all. Mr Bruce, who is now returning to Aus-",61
NA,"tralia from a trip to England, has his hands",61
NA,filled with the affairs of the business of,61
NA,"Paterson, Laing and Bruce, which he has",61
NA,again taken up since his temporary retirement,61
NA,from politics. I t is questionable whether he,61
NA,will be able to spare the time to attend to the,61
NA,administration of an important public depart-,61
NA,ment.,61
NA,That appeared at a time when there was,61
NA,considerable discussion regarding the pos-,61
NA,sible personnel of the new federal,61
NA,ministry. The quotation indicates that,61
NA,that gentleman was more concerned at,61
NA,the time about his own commercial affairs,61
NA,than about the affairs of the nation.,61
Mr LANE , O n whose authoritywas,61
NA,that writtten ?,61
Mr BAKER , T h e quotation is f r o m,61
NA,a newspaper which is a strong supporter,61
NA,of the present Government. I t may be,61
NA,interesting to see how f a r the principle,61
NA,contained i n the bill conflicts w i th the,61
NA,"H i g h Commissioner Act 1909, which i t is",61
NA,intended to amend. Section 7 of that,61
NA,act reads-,61
NA,_A person appointed to be the High Com-,61
NA,missioner shall not during his tenure of office,61
NA,be or act as director or agent of or hold,61
NA,any office in any company or syndicate,61
NA,whether incorporated' or unincorporated or,61
NA,"hold any other employment, or engage in any",61
NA,business whether within or without tlie Com-,61
NA,monwealth.,61
NA,That section is not being repealed by,61
NA,this bill. Though nominally the right,61
NA,honorable member fo r Flinders is to,61
NA,"become Resident Minister i n London, he",61
NA,will at the same time perform the duties,61
NA,of H i g h Commissioner. That is i n direct,61
NA,conflict with the provisions of section 7,61
NA,"of the principal act. Apparently, the",61
NA,Government has not yet considered thai,61
NA,point.,61
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL , H o w can,61
NA,the honorable member make his remarks,61
NA,relevant?,61
Mr BAKER , T h e right honorable,61

NA,"viously, that is evident.",61
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL , T h e hon-,61
NA,orable member does not know the right,61
NA,honorable gentleman's private busineSs.,61
Mr BAKER , T h e point to which I,61
NA,have referred should have been considered,61
NA,by the Government before i t introduced,61
NA,the bill . This intention of the Go-,61
NA,vernment was not mentioned in,61
NA,the Flinders or any other elec-,61
NA,torate during the last federal elec-,61
NA,tion. I t would have been interesting to,61
NA,witness the reaction of the electors of,61
NA,Flinders i f told that i f they re-,61
NA,"turned the Bight Honorable S. M . Bruce,",61
NA,"ostensibly to lead the Government, he",61
NA,would be sent overseas f o r an indefinite,61
NA,"period. Incidentally, immediately the",61
NA,right honorable member was defeated i n,61
NA,"1929, while Prime Minister, he displayed",61
NA,so little interest i n Australia that he went,61
NA,overseas and had not sufficient considera-,61
NA,tion for the electors to return to this,61
NA,country i n time to participate i n the,61
NA,election campaign.,61
NA,The Prime Minister admits that the,61
NA,measure is designed to f u l f i l a temporary,61
NA,need. That the Government realizes,61
NA,the dangers of the bill is mani-,61
NA,fest f r o m the fact that i t has limited its,61
NA,operation to a period of-two years. The,61
NA,whole procedure of sending overseas a,61
NA,person who is noted for his anti-Aus-,62
NA,tralian sympathies is i n conformity with,62
NA,the anti-Australian interests of a Go-,62
NA,vernment that has introduced an Austra-,62
NA,lian-industry-smashing tariff i n the past,62
NA,few days. The Government declares that,62
NA,one reason f o r the project i s . to effect,62
NA,economy. I f the Government we're,62
NA,sincere i t would not appoint anybody to,62
NA,the position for some time. I f i t is deter-,62
NA,mined to appoint somebody i t would,62
NA,be wise to select either an official who,62
NA,"understood the position overseas, or some",62
NA,member of the community who has in,62
NA,the past shown strong Australian ten-,62
NA,"dencies, instead of strong Australian",62

NA,This act shall continue in operation for a,62

Mr BEASLEY ,West Sydney) [10.45].,62
NA,- I move the following amendment:-,62
NA,"That the words "" two years"" be omitted",62
NA,with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words,62
NA,""" six months "".",62
NA,The supporters of this bill have argued,62
NA,that the main purpose of appointing a,62
NA,Resident Minister in London is to effect,62
NA,the conversion of our overseas debt. I f,62
NA,"we accept that argument, we take leave to",62
NA,"point out that, unless this conversion is",62
NA,"carried through within six months, Aus-",62
NA,tralia's finances w i l l be in a very sorry,62
NA,plight. The taxpayers cannot continue,62
NA,to meet the present exorbitant rate of,62
NA,42 interest. We on this side of the House,62
NA,have urged for the last eighteen months,62
NA,16,62
NA,or two years the need forundertaking,62
NA,"this conversion, and the longer i t is",62
NA,26,62
NA,delayed the more serious the problem will,62
NA,AYES. become. A further reason for proposing,62
NA,to reduce'the duration of the act is to,62
NA,minimize the expense incidental to the,62
NA,keeping of a Resident Minister i n London.,62
NA,By moving this amendment I hope to,62
NA,"impress upon honorable members, and",62
NA,"upon the people generally, the urgency",62
NA,of converting our overseas debt.,62
Mr ROSEVEAR ,Dalley) [10.48] -,62
NA,[ support the amendment. I f the object,62
NA,of this mission is to be achieved at all-,62
NA,"namely, the conversion of^our colossal",62
NA,overseas debt-i t must be done this year.,62
NA,I n his budget speech the Prime Minister,62
NA,warned us that i f the Hoover mora-,62
NA,torium,62
The CHAIRMAN ,Th e,62
NA,honorable member must confine his,62
NA,remarks to the clause and the amendment.,62
NA,NOES. There is nothing i n either the clause or,62
NA,the amendment relating to the Hoover,62
NA,"moratorium, or the conversion of our",62
NA,overseas debt.,62
Mr ROSEVEAR , I submit that we,62
NA,are entitled to state our reasons for mov-,62
NA,ing that the duration of this measure be,62
NA,six months instead of two years. There,62
NA,must have been some reason for fixing i t,62
NA,"PAIRS. at two years in the first place, and we",62
NA,certainly have a reason for seeking to,62
NA,reduce the period to six months.,62
The CHAIRMAN , N o t h i n g in the,63
NA,biil and certainly nothing in this clause,63
NA,gives any reason why the Resident,63
NA,Minister i u London should be. appointed,63
NA,to do the work referred to by the,63
NA,honorable member.,63
Mr ROSEVEAR , I suggest that a,63
NA,period of six months is sufficient for the,63
NA,work outlined by the Minister who intro-,63
NA,duced the bill.,63
The CHAIRMAN , T h e honorable,63
NA,member is iu order in arguing that a,63
NA,period of six months is sufficient f or the,63
NA,Resident Minister in London tb do that,63
NA,"work, but not in referring to moratoriums",63
NA,or anything of the kind to which no refer-,63
NA,ence is made in the bill.,63
Mr ROSEVEAR ,W e claim that a,63
NA,period of six months w i l l be ample for,63
NA,the Resident Minister in London to do all,63
NA,the work i t is proposed he should do. No,63
NA,reason has been.given for extending the,63
NA,period to two years.,63
Mr SCULLIN , Y a r r a ) [10.52] -I f,63
NA,the amendment is designed to weaken the,63
NA,"proposition before the committee, i t meets",63
NA,"with my approval, but I wish to make i t",63
NA,clear that while I vote f or the amend-,63
NA,"ment, I do not accept the principle of the",63
NA,bill even to the extent of six months. I,63
NA,prefer to vote straight out against each,63
NA,"clause, but i f the amendment goes to a",63
NA,"division, I shall vote f or i t as being the",63
NA,lesser of two evils. I cannot oppose the,63
NA,amendment. That would be tantamount,63
NA,to accepting a longer term. On the other,63
NA,"hand, to vote f o r the amendment is tanta-",63
NA,mount to a declaration that i t is necessary,63
NA,to have a Resident Minister in London,63
NA,"with these powers for six months. That,",63
NA,I dispute. The arguments advanced about,63
NA,the loan conversion are to a large extent,63
NA,a subterfuge. I do not dispute the im-,63
NA,"portance of that work, and the need f or a",63
NA,Minister to be in London while i t is being,63
NA,done has never been challenged by any,63
NA,"one on this side of this chamber, at any",63
NA,rate not by me. How could I challenge,63
NA,it in view of the importance of the con-,63
NA,version operations ? I must agree with the,63
NA,"mission now being undertaken, even i f",63
NA,a Minister has to remain in London,63
NA,longer than six months. But I do not,63
NA,think he need stay longer than six months.,63
NA,When the preliminary arrangements are,63
NA,"being made he must be i n London, but",63
NA,"those steps having been successfully taken,",63
NA,there is a capable officer -in London to,63
NA,"leave in charge. I differ, however, f r o m",63
NA,the present proposal of the Government,63
NA,"to have a Besident Minister i n London,",63
NA,and that is the principle involved in this,63
NA,bill.,63
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL , W h e r e is,63
NA,it to be found in the bill ? -,63
Mr SCULLIN , T h e whole thing is,63
NA,involved in the bill. There is no need,63
NA,for this measure to give the right honor-,63
NA,able member f o r Flinders ( Mr Bruce),63
NA,the power to control Australia House.,63
NA,I f the secretary who is already there has,63
NA,"no H i g h Commissioner, he w i l l act under",63
NA,the instructions of any Minister who is,63
NA,in London just as he would act under,63
NA,instructions f r o m a Minister i n Australia.,63
Mr JAMES ,Hunter) [10.55] - I,63
NA,support the amendment. Like the right,63
NA,honorable the Leader of the Opposition,63
NA,"( Mr Scullin), I am opposed to the bill",63
NA,as a whole on the ground that i t con-,63
NA,flicts with the H i g h Commissioner Act,63
NA,"1909, as the honorable member f o r Oxley",63

Mr BEASLEY ,West Sydney) [11.8].,64
NA,What is the significance of the phrase,64
NA,""" to any Minister or to any member of",64
NA,"the Executive Council""?",64
Mr LATHAM ,Kooyong-Attorney -,64
NA,General) [11.9] --Th e distinction ia,64
NA,between what are described in the Con-,64
NA,stitution as Ministers of State administer-,64
NA,"ing certain departments, and Ministers",64
NA,without portfolios. They are all members,64
NA,"of the Federal Executive Council, but a",64
NA,Minister without portfolio is not strictly,64
NA,a' Minister of State in the constitutional,64
NA,sense.,64
Mr JAMES ,Hunter) [11.10] - I also,64
NA,direct attention to the point that was,64
NA,raised during the second-reading debate,64
NA,by the honorable member for'Oxley ( Mr.,64
NA,25 Baker). Proposed new section 9A of the,64
NA,High Commissioner Act provides that the,64
NA,AXES. Governor-General may issue to any,64
NA,Minister or any member of the Execu-,64
NA,tive Council a commission authorizing,64
NA,"him "" to exercise the powers and to per-",64

NA,Section 7 of the High Commissioner Act,64

NA,A person appointed to be the High Commis-,64

NA,or act as director or agent of or hold any,64
NA,"office in any company or syndicate, whether",64
NA,"incorporated or unincorporated, or hold any",64
NA,"other employment, or engage in any business",64
NA,whether within or without the Common-,64
NA,wealth.,64
NA,We all know that the right honorable,64
NA,member for Flinders has interests in pri-,64
NA,"vate business houses, notably that of",64
NA,"Notts. Paterson, Laing and Bruce Limited.",64
NA,Would not the performance by him of the,64
NA,duties of High Commissioner be a con-,64
NA,travention of the aet?,64
Mr LATHAM ,Kooyong-Attorney -,64
NA,General) [11.12] -Ther e is no inconsis-,64
NA,tency between this amending bill and the,64
NA,"High Commissioner Act. .Section 7, to",64
NA,which the honorable member for Hunter,64
NA,"( Mr James) has just directed attention,",64
NA,refers to a person who is appointed as,64
NA,High Commissioner under the terms of,64
NA,that act for the period mentioned in sec-,64
NA,tion 3. This bill does not appoint a,64
NA,person to that office at all. A l l that it,64
NA,does is to empower a Minister or member,64
NA,of the Executive Council to perform the,64
NA,functions and duties of the High Com-,64
NA,missioner. When a Minister is being,64
NA,"appointed for a temporary period, there",65
NA,are not thought to be the same reasons,65
NA,to apply the provisions of section 7 to,65
NA,such appointment.,65
Mr SCULLIN ,"Nevertheless , this bill",65
NA,is a violation of the spirit of section 7.,65
Mr LATHAM ,I t is open to Parlia-,65
NA,ment tolegislate that every mem-,65
NA,"ber of i t should surrender all commercial,",65
NA,"industrial and financial interests; that,",65
NA,"in fact, he should be occupied with no",65
NA,other duties. I t could so provide f o r,65
NA,"Ministers and, i f it thought proper, any",65
NA,person appointed under any act; but I,65
NA,am glad to say that up to the present,65
NA,Parliament has taken the more generous,65
NA,and the wiser Anew that Ministers and,65
NA,members should not divorce themselves,65
NA,from the general activities of the com-,65
NA,munity.,65
Mr BEASLEY ,West Sydney) [11.14].,65
NA,"- I t is clear, from the remarks of the",65
NA,Attorney-General ( Mr Latham) that the,65
NA,right honorable member for Flinders,65
NA,( Mr Bruce) would not be eligible for,65
NA,"appointment as High Commissioner, and",65
NA,that any such appointment would be in,65
NA,contravention of section 7 of the High,65
NA,Commissioner Act.,65
Mr LATHAM ,I f i t fell within section,65
NA,"7, yes.",65
Mr BEASLEY ,"Therefore , the point",65
NA,made by the honorable member for Oxley,65
NA,( Mr Baker) was an important one.,65
Mr LATHAM ,I t is perfectly obvious,65
NA,that a distinction is being drawn be-,65
NA,tween a Minister and another person,65
NA,appointed as High Commissioner.,65
Mr BEASLEY ,On e aspect which,65
NA,"we should bear in mind is that, while the",65
NA,right honorable member for Flinders has,65
NA,not actually been appointed High Com-,65
NA,"missioner, he will discharge all the func-",65
NA,tions and duties of that office.,65
Mr SCULLIN ,Unde r a different title.,65
Mr BEASLEY ,"Tha t being so, the",65
NA,explanation offered by the Attorney-,65
NA,General is very thin.,65
NA,Mr .SCULLIN -Th e bill certainly,65
NA,violates the spirit of the original act.,65
Mr BEASLEY ,Ther e is no doubt,65
NA,"about that, and I am certain that the",65
NA,people generally will appreciate the point,65
NA,that has been raised by the - honorable,65
NA,member for Oxley.,65
Mr HOLLOWAY ,Melbourne Ports),65
NA,"[11.15],- I should like to know from the",65
NA,Minister in charge of the bill ( Mr.,65
NA,Parkhill) i f it has been specially drafted,65
NA,to overcome the difficulty which has just,65
NA,"been mentioned, namely, that the right",65
NA,honorable member for Flinders or any,65
NA,other honorable member was ineligible for,65
NA,appointment to the position of High,65
NA,Commissioner under the principal act?,65
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,War-,65
NA,ringah-Ministe r for the Interior),65
NA,[11.16] -Th e bill was not drafted for,65
NA,the purpose suggested by the honorable,65
NA,member for Melbourne Ports ( Mr.,65
NA,Holloway). Nor is it true to say that the,65
NA,measure is merely a. subterfuge to enable,65
NA,the Government to invest the Minister,65
NA,who happens to be in London with autho-,65
NA,rity to discharge duties ordinarily per-,65
NA,formed by the High Commissioner. I t,65
NA,would be anomalous for a Minister to be,65
NA,at Australia House and have no authority,65
NA,whatever.,65
Mr SCULLIN ,Th e Minister surely,65
NA,does not seriously suggest that a Minister,65
NA,would have no authority over public ser-,65
NA,vants in Australia House!,65
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL , I do.,65
NA,Some of our officials there are of very,65
NA,"high standing, and some Ministers are",65
NA,still modest enough to be disinclined to,65
NA,exert control without specific authority,65
NA,from Parliament. The bill merely pro-,65
NA,vides that the Minister who happens to,65
NA,be in London for the time being shall exer-,65
NA,cise the necessary authority of and dis-,65
NA,charge the duties ordinarily performed by,65
NA,the High Commissioner. The Leader of,65
NA,the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) has ad-,65
NA,mitted that i t is essential for some,65
NA,"Minister to be there, although he affects",65
NA,"to believe that later everything, can be left",65
NA,"to Mr Collins, the Official Secretary.",65
NA,The Government takes the view that the,65
NA,Minister in London should be authorized,65
NA,to do all that it is proposed to do.,65
Mr BAKER ,Oxley) [11.17] - I f this,65
NA,"bill is hot a subterfuge, why does not",65
NA,the Government give the Besident,65
NA,Minister the title of High Com-,65
NA,"missioner ? Obviously, the reason is that",65
NA,it would be a contravention of section 7 of,65
NA,the High Commissioner Act. The,65
NA,Attorney-General ( Mr Latham) said,65
NA,"just now that, as the Besident Minister",65
NA,would be in London for only a short,65
NA,"period, it was not necessary to do so; but",65
NA,when he was speaking to the second,65
NA,"reading of the bill, ha expressed tbe",66
NA,opinion that the appointment 'should be,66
NA,"t'or a longer period than two years; that,",66
NA,"in fact, i t should be approved as a prin-",66
NA,"ciple. This bill is a violation of the spirit Dein, A. K.",66
NA,"of the act of 1909, which i t seeks to",66
NA,amend. The Attorney-General added,66
NA,"chat, i f the act were so construed as to",66
NA,render the right honorable member f o r,66
NA,"flinders ineligible, i t might also be sug-",66
NA,gested that i t should apply to.al l mem-,66
NA,"bers of Parliament. As a matter of fact,",66
NA,the Constitution does restrict members of,66
NA,Parliament by preventing them from,66
NA,holding an office of profit under the,66
NA,"Crown, - and provides, further, that no",66
NA,member shall be absent f r o m a session,66
NA,of the Parliament f o r more than,66
NA,two months without leave. Certainly i t,66
NA,was never contemplated that legislation,66
NA,would have to be introduced to provide,66
NA,for such a position as has now arisen.,66
Mr WARD ,East Sydney) [11.22] -,66
NA,Evidently those who framed the original,66
NA,act thought that a definite restriction,66
NA,should be imposed upon the business,66
NA,activities of any person occupying the,66
NA,position ofHigh Commissioner.,66
NA,mere transfer of the duties of H i g h,66
NA,Commissioner to a Besident Minister,66
NA,does not alter the principle laid down,66
NA,in section 7 or reduce the opportunities of,66
NA,the occupant of the office to further the,66
NA,interests of any fir m with which he is,66
NA,itonnected. The suggestion earlier i n the,66
NA,"debate, that some personal advantage",66
NA,might accrue to a representative of,66
NA,"m important firm holding this office,",66
NA,"was ridiculed. I t is apparent, how-",66
NA,"ever, that great care was taken i n",66
NA,"the framing of this clause, because the",66
NA,Government realized that the principle,66
NA,contained i n section 7 must be violated,66
NA,if the right honorable member f o r,66
NA,Flinders ( Mr Bruce) were to occupy the,66
NA,"office of High Commissioner, while re-",66
NA,taining his connexion with a private,66
NA,.business firm. For that reason I shall,66

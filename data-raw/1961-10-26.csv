NA,CONTRACTORS FOR WEAPONS,11
NA,RESEARCH.,11
Mr MAKIN , I wish to direct a question,11
NA,to the Minister for Supply. Can he tell,11
NA,me whether it is a fact that certain private,11
NA,firms which have branches in the Weapons,11
NA,Research Establishment at Elizabeth in,11
NA,South Australia propose merging into a,11
NA,single business enterprise to be known as the,11
NA,Hawker Siddeley Group? What is the pur-,11
NA,pose of this merger?,11
Mr HULME , I cannot give the honor-,11
NA,able gentleman any precise information. He,11
NA,will appreciate that many of the contractors,11
NA,for the Weapons Research Establishment are,11
NA,contractors from the United Kingdom.,11
NA,There have been amalgamations in the Old,11
NA,Country. I shall find out what I can and,11
NA,let the honorable member have any avail-,11
NA,able information as soon as possible.,11
NA,BEEF-CATTLE ROADS.,11
NA,NA,11
NA,Treasurer in order to clear up some con-,11
NA,fusion which seems to exist. Will the right,11
NA,honorable gentleman state the position in,11
NA,regard to the selection of roads and the,11
NA,priority given in determining which roads,11
NA,"shall be built with the £5,000,000, out of a",11
NA,"total expenditure of £5,350,000, to be pro-",11
NA,vided by this Government for beef-cattle,11
NA,"roads in Queensland? In particular, will he",11
NA,state the position concerning the flexibility,11
NA,"of the scheme and whether other roads,",11
NA,although not actually included in this,11
NA,"scheme, will be considered if a case for their",11
NA,construction is submitted?,11
Mr HAROLD HOLT , I was not aware,11
NA,that any confusion on this matter existed.,11
NA,It certainly does not exist in the minds of,11
NA,members of the Queensland Government.,11
NA,"The Prime Minister has been in communicabody,",11
NA,"tion with the Premier of Queensland, and",11
NA,"for some time discussions between reprepassed,",11
NA,sentatives of the Commonwealth and the,11
NA,State Government about road construction,11
NA,in Queensland have been going on with the,11
NA,object of promoting beef production for,11
NA,"export from that State. Some time ago, the",11
NA,Queensland Government submitted to us a,11
NA,priority list of roads as they were viewed,11
NA,"by that Government. Subsequently, there",11
NA,was worked out an arrangement under which,11
NA,"the Commonwealth was to provide, over a",11
NA,"five-year period, £5,000,000 out of a total",11
NA,"expenditure of £5,350,000, as the honorable",11
NA,"member has mentioned. At that stage, the",11
NA,Queensland Government supplied a list of,11
NA,roads selected from those in the priority list.,11
NA,The Commonwealth Government has,11
NA,"accepted that list, but, in the bill before the",11
NA,"Parliament, we did not specify any road",11
NA,other than the one which is currently under,11
NA,construction. We have intimated to the,11
NA,Queensland Government that we have done,11
NA,this in order to leave room for some flexi-,11
NA,bility if it has other views about the roads,11
NA,"as time goes on. If it has, the matter will be",11
NA,open for discussion between the governments,11
NA,concerned.,11
NA,"I may say that, in a general way, we have",11
NA,let the Queensland Government know that,11
NA,we have in mind the construction of a,11
NA,system of roads through the north of Aus-,11
NA,"tralia, and therefore we have been looking",11
NA,to the development of roads which have been,11
NA,"proved, after consultation, to be in accord-",11
NA,ance with our general wishes in the matter.,11
NA,"However, we have not at any stage attempted",11
NA,to dictate to the Queensland Government,11
NA,where new roads are to be constructed. To,11
NA,"the best of my knowledge, which is based",11
NA,"on a close acquaintance with this matter, the",11
NA,roads selected are those which the State,11
NA,Government itself wished to have built,11
NA,within the scheme.,11
NA,NORTHERN TERRITORY.,11
Mr NELSON , I ask the Minister for,11
NA,Territories to comment on the action of the,11
NA,elected and non-official members of the,11
NA,Legislative Council for the Northern Terri-,11
NA,tory in serving notice on the Government,11
NA,that at the coming meeting of the council,11
NA,"they, because of their majority, will control",11
NA,the business and order of business of that,11
NA,"and also that, in the event of the",11
NA,Government's requiring legislation to be,11
NA,it will have to get an elected mem-,11
NA,ber to introduce it. Having regard to the,11
NA,action that these men feel compelled to take,11
NA,"in order to focus attention on the position,",11
NA,does not the Minister consider it is time,11
NA,that the council was reconstituted in order,12
NA,to provide for a fully elected body with,12
NA,defined powers?,12
Mr HASLUCK ,Par t of the honorable,12
NA,"gentleman's question refers to policy, and I",12
NA,will not touch on that. The handling of,12
NA,political situations that arise in the LegisAustralian,12
NA,"lative Council is, of course, a matter for",12
NA,"the Administrator, who is president of the",12
NA,council. The Government has no doubt of,12
NA,his capacity to handle political situations,12
NA,"that may arise in the council, and to get",12
NA,the business through. I am sure that every,12
NA,"member of this House will realize, from his",12
NA,"own parliamentary experience, that control",12
NA,of a legislative body cannot be taken out,12
NA,"of the hands of the Government, because",12
NA,tbat would create a situation in which,12
NA,government would completely collapse.,12
NA,UNITED NATIONS.,12
Mr DEAN ,I n directing a question to,12
NA,the Prime Minister and Minister for Exter-,12
NA,nal Affairs I refer to the report that the,12
NA,Political Committee of the United Nations,12
NA,carried a resolution calling on Russia to,12
NA,"cease exploding megaton nuclear devices,",12
NA,and that some 22 nations abstained from,12
NA,voting. Do the delegates who generally,12
NA,abstain come from the neutralist bloc of,12
NA,"countries? If so, does it come within the",12
NA,power of the Australian Government to do,12
NA,anything more to impress on people that,12
NA,neutrals can exist as such only under the,12
NA,protection of the free nations?,12
Mr MENZIES ,Withou t dealing with,12
NA,"any particular vote, the results of which",12
NA,"I do not have in mind, I may tell the",12
NA,honorable member that our delegation-,12
NA,and I am glad to say it is not the only,12
NA,"one to do this-lose s no opportunity,",12
NA,"either in meetings or in the lobby, of",12
NA,pressing upon people that if there were,12
NA,committed and alined nations in the,12
NA,world there would be not much room,12
NA,for unalined countries.,12
NA,LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE.,12
Mr BIRD ,Ha s the Treasurer given,12
NA,any consideration to the idea that the,12
NA,"tralian Loan Council, in addition to raising",12
NA,"money for State government requirements,",12
NA,should also raise money for municipal,12
NA,local government works? If this practice,12
NA,"were adopted, would it mean that interest",12
NA,charges for municipalities would be i per,12
NA,"cent, lower than at present?",12
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,A s honorable,12
NA,"gentlemen are aware, at meetings of the",12
NA,Loan Council discussions take,12
NA,place on the approved total level of borrow-,12
NA,ing by local government authorities for the,12
NA,financial year ahead. I am not sufficiently,12
NA,familiar with the early history of this matter,12
NA,to know how far discussion may have pro-,12
NA,ceeded towards the objective that the,12
NA,honorable member now recommends to us.,12
NA,The idea he has expressed has a certain,12
NA,"superficial attraction, but I have no doubt",12
NA,that it also carries considerable complexity.,12
NA,It might not even be welcomed by indi-,12
NA,vidual local government authorities that have,12
NA,developed a particular relationship with,12
NA,some financial institution or bank. How-,12
NA,"ever, the matter certainly merits examina-",12
NA,"tion, and I assure the honorable gentleman",12
NA,that I shall look into it in the period that,12
NA,lies ahead of us.,12
NA,REPATRIATION.,12
Mr ANDERSON , I direct a question,12
NA,to the Minister for Repatriation. Recently,12
NA,I have had to inquire into the progress of,12
NA,some mentally ill ex-servicemen. What is,12
NA,the incidence of mental illness in ex-service-,12
NA,men in comparison with the civilian popula-,12
NA,tion? What success has been achieved with,12
NA,"treatment by the Repatriation Department,",12
NA,and has the Minister any further plans for,12
NA,dealing with this difficult human problem?,12
Mr OSBORNE ,Th e percentage of,12
NA,mentally ill repatriation patients being,12
NA,treated in our repatriation general hospitals,12
NA,is disclosed in the annual report of the,12
NA,imRepatriation Commission which was tabled,12
NA,"not recently. It runs, from recollection, at",12
NA,free about 12 per cent. The percentage has,12
NA,"left shown an increase over recent years,",12
NA,but no alarming conclusions should be,12
NA,"drawn from that fact, because it is asso-",12
NA,ciated with the increasing age of the ex-,12
NA,service population and more particularly,12
NA,with the completely changed attitude,12
NA,Austowards mental illness in the medical pro-,12
NA,"fession and the community generally. It is,",12
NA,"in fact, a matter of diagnosis and avail-",12
NA,and ability of treatment.,12
NA,The honorable member asked me how,13
NA,repatriation figures in this connexion comthe,13
NA,pare with those in respect of the civilian,13
NA,population. I have looked into this before. of the West.,13
NA,"No proper basis of comparison is available,",13
NA,but my medical advisers in the Repatriation,13
NA,Department say that they have no reason to,13
NA,believe that mental illness is more frequent,13
NA,among the ex-service population than it,13
NA,"is among other people. As to the future,",13
NA,"our hospitals face a difficulty, common",13
NA,"all hospitals throughout Australia, in ob-",13
NA,taining the services of doctors trained in the,13
NA,treatment of mental illnesses. There is a,13
NA,shortage of psychiatrists throughout the,13
NA,country. We are giving opportunities to,13
NA,young doctors for training in this field in,13
NA,"our hospitals, but it is a difficult problem.",13
NA,The principal psychiatry consultant to,13
NA,my department has just returned from a,13
NA,study visit to the United States of America,13
NA,"and Canada, where he made a particular",13
NA,study of the treatment in veterans' hospitals.,13
NA,He has made a comprehensive report which,13
NA,is now being studied. 1 think I can assure,13
NA,"the honorable gentleman that in the future,",13
NA,"as in the past, the treatment for the mentally",13
NA,ill among entitled ex-servicemen will be the,13
NA,most sympathetic and advanced that,13
NA,available.,13
NA,EXTERNAL AFFAIRS.,13
Mr BRYANT ,M y question is directed,13
NA,to the Minister for External Affairs. Earlier,13
NA,"this morning, the right honorable gentleman",13
NA,gave strength to the view that Australia is,13
NA,pretty well committed to support the West-,13
NA,ern position uncritically in foreign affairs.,13
NA,few weeks ago he said we were committed,13
NA,to the Western position in Berlin. Last week,13
NA,I asked whether he had examined the state-,13
NA,ment of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in,13
NA,the United Kingdom that the United,13
NA,Kingdom would go to war over Berlin. Now,13
NA,I ask the right honorable gentleman: Is,13
NA,the United Kingdom committed to go to war,13
NA,over Berlin and are we committed to sup-,13
NA,port the United Kingdom if that happens?,13
Mr MENZIES ,Th e honorable member,13
NA,must have a very low opinion of me if he,13
NA,thinks that at this stage and at question-,13
NA,time I will undertake to make a statement,13
NA,about the views of the Government of the,13
NA,"United Kingdom, f certainly do not pro-",13
NA,pose to do so. I would point out that the,13
NA,honorable member slipped into his question,13
NA,"word "" uncritically "". It has never been",13
NA,said that we uncritically follow the policy,13
NA,"Mr Bryant -O f course, you do.",13
Mr MENZIES ,"Well , we know who our",13
NA,"friends are, and our friends who are very",13
NA,important to Australia-ou r great friends,13
NA,in the United Kingdom and the United,13
NA,to States of America-s o far from being unac-,13
NA,customed to critical support from us receive,13
NA,our critical views in close detail with great,13
NA,"regularity. When the cards are down, we",13
NA,know what side we are on.,13
NA,DECIMAL CURRENCY.,13
Mr HALBERT ,M y question is ad-,13
NA,dressed to the Treasurer. Has he seen,13
NA,the published criticism of spokesmen for,13
NA,a decimal currency organization alleging,13
NA,unwarranted delays by the Government in,13
NA,making a change to a decimal currency,13
NA,system? Can he tell the House whether,13
NA,there has been any general change in the,13
NA,Government's attitude of acceptance of,13
NA,the desirability in principle of introducing a,13
NA,is decimal currency system? Can he assure,13
NA,the House that the necessary administrative,13
NA,steps are being actively taken?,13
Mr HAROLD HOLT , I have seen,13
NA,some published comment by spokesmen,13
NA,for one of the decimal currency organiza-,13
NA,tions and I can understand the zeal of en-,13
NA,thusiasts in pressing their own point of,13
NA,view on this matter. I assure the House,13
NA,A and the honorable gentleman that there,13
NA,has been no change in the general attitude,13
NA,previously announced on behalf of the,13
NA,Government of support for the introduc-,13
NA,"tion of decimal currency, if that commends",13
NA,itself to us after we have examined all the,13
NA,practical problems involved. There are,13
NA,many practical problems. 1 can also,13
NA,assure the honorable gentleman that there,13
NA,is no avoidable delay in examining the,13
NA,problems and in dealing with them. In-,13
NA,"deed, as.j recently as last week, I chaired a",13
NA,meenrig of a cabinet committee which was,13
NA,examining the form and composition of,13
NA,coinage which may have to be adopted in,13
NA,ihe future.,13
NA,Decisions on these matters are them-,13
NA,selves basic to the consequential decisions,13
NA,about the construction of a mint in Can-,14
NA,"berra, its size, the machinery that would",14
NA,"have to go into it, and so on. In these",14
NA,and other ways we are maintaining our,14
NA,interest and our activity in this matter. I,14
NA,previously told the House of discussions,14
NA,that have occurred between myself and,14
NA,finance ministers from the United King-,14
NA,"dom and New Zealand. This, too, could",14
NA,"have a bearing, if not on our time-table,",14
NA,then possibly on the nomenclature of any,14
NA,coins that may be subsequently adopted.,14
NA,"Generally speaking, it can be taken,",14
NA,"therefore, that we are doing what we can",14
NA,to keep this matter actively before us.,14
NA,RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA-,14
NA,PUBLIC SERVICE.,14
Mr CALWELL , I ask the Prime Miniscrease,14
NA,ter a question. Does he recollect that,14
NA,three occasions quite recently I have asked,14
NA,him whether he would make a statement,14
NA,about the contract for the building of,14
NA,Reserve Bank in Sydney? On two occasions,14
NA,he said he would make inquiries and advise,14
NA,"the House, if he could, of the reasons why",14
NA,one of the two lowest tenders was not of home building?,14
NA,accepted. I now ask him whether he is,14
NA,in a position to make a statement on the,14
NA,"matter. Yesterday, the Prime Minister said",14
NA,he would reply to a question asked by the,14
NA,honorable member for Barton concerning,14
NA,professional engineers in the Public Service.,14
NA,I take advantage of this opportunity to ask,14
NA,whether he will make that statement also.,14
Mr MENZIES ,A s to the first part of,14
NA,"the honorable gentleman's question, I",14
NA,form him that I expect to get to him some,14
NA,time this afternoon the answer he wants.,14
NA,Yesterday the honorable member for the,14
NA,Barton asked how far the Public Service,14
NA,Board had proceeded with the re-organizaincrease,14
NA,tion of professional engineers within the,14
NA,Public Service following the recent award,14
NA,the Commonwealth Conciliation and,14
NA,tration Commission in the engineers' case. purposes.,14
NA,The board has been engaged in discussions,14
NA,with the departments on the re-organization,14
NA,of the engineering services of the Commonin,14
NA,wealth. The discussions with the Departprevious,14
NA,"ment of Works, which is one of the departhome-building",14
NA,"ments affected, have been completed and",14
NA,action is being taken to bring the re-organizabanks,14
NA,tion into force immediately. Action in,14
NA,respect of the other departments is pro-,14
NA,ceeding.,14
NA,"The Commonwealth has implemented,",14
NA,"and will continue to implement, the deter-",14
NA,minations of the Commonwealth Concilia-,14
NA,tion and Arbitration Commission. The,14
NA,board is also providing that a qualified,14
NA,engineering officer who may temporarily-,14
NA,and it would be only temporary-becom e,14
NA,surplus with this re-classification will re-,14
NA,tain the increase provided under the board's,14
NA,adjustment measures pending absorption,14
NA,into the new establishment at that level.,14
NA,HOUSING FINANCE.,14
Mr CASH ,M y question is directed to,14
NA,the Treasurer. Is it a fact that the latest,14
NA,figures released show an encouraging in-,14
NA,in the level of deposits with the State,14
NA,on savings banks? Does this mean that the,14
NA,savings banks will have more funds avail-,14
NA,able to lend for home building? In view,14
NA,the of the somewhat lower level of building,14
NA,approvals revealed in the published figures,14
NA,"for September, is the Government doing",14
NA,anything to encourage an increased volume,14
Mr HAROLD HOLT , I am glad to be,14
NA,able to report to the House that there has,14
NA,been an encouraging increase in the level of,14
NA,savings bank deposits over recent months.,14
NA,"Honorable members will recall that, follow-",14
NA,ing the measures taken by the Government,14
NA,"in November, there was some decline in the",14
NA,"level of savings bank deposits, but this was",14
NA,more than offset in volume by the increase,14
NA,which occurred in fixed deposits with the,14
NA,inmajor trading banks. Over the last four,14
NA,"months, we have seen substantial increases",14
NA,in both these directions. For that period,14
NA,increase in savings bank deposits has,14
NA,"been £77,800,000, and the amount of the",14
NA,"in fixed deposits £51,300,000. That",14
NA,"does have, I believe, a useful effect on the",14
NA,of level of lending by the State savings banks,14
NA,Arbiand other savings banks for housing,14
NA,As the published accounts of the Com-,14
NA,"monwealth Banking Corporation now reveal,",14
NA,"1960-61, there was an increase over the",14
NA,"year of £4,000,000 in lending for",14
NA,"purposes, but the Common-",14
NA,"wealth Savings Bank, and other savings",14
NA,relate their housing lending generally,14
NA,"to the level of deposits with them. So that,",14
NA,"with an increase of deposits, it is reasonable",15
NA,to assume that there will be some increase in,15
NA,the amount of lending for home-building,15
NA,purposes.,15
NA,"1 would just add that, in addition to the",15
NA,action which it took earlier in the year to,15
NA,encourage greater lending through savings,15
NA,"banks, the Government has made available",15
NA,"the record amount of just under £43,000,000",15
NA,to the States for housing purposes this year.,15
NA,"Of that amount, 30 per cent, is to be allo-",15
NA,cated through the building societies. In this,15
NA,"and other ways, the Government is doing",15
NA,what it usefully can to maintain a healthy,15
NA,level of honie-building activity in Australia.,15
NA,PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA.,15
Mr BEATON , I address a question to,15
NA,"the Minister for Territories, who will recall",15
NA,-having had discussions in August with,15
NA,representatives of the Young Women's,15
NA,Christian Association concerning Govern-,15
NA,ment aid for the establishment of a,15
NA,-Y.W.C.A. hostel in the Territory of Papua,15
NA,"and New Guinea at, I believe, Port",15
NA,Moresby. I ask the Minister whether any,15
NA,decision has yet been made regarding this,15
NA,"very worthy cause. If not, will the Go-",15
NA,vernment give urgent and favorable con-,15
NA,sideration to the matter?,15
Mr HASLUCK ,Th e discussions I had,15
NA,with representatives of the Young Women's,15
NA,Christian Association in August were,15
NA,the only discussions I have had with them.,15
NA,We have discussed the possibility of their,15
NA,extending their work in the Territory,15
NA,several occasions. As a result of the latest,15
NA,"discussions, the Government made it posGepps",15
NA,sible for representatives of the association,15
NA,to visit the Territory in order to examine,15
NA,"the nature of the need that existed there,",15
NA,and to have further discussions on the,15
NA,spot with officers of the Administration.,15
NA,"After their return, I wrote to the associahave",15
NA,tion indicating ways in which the Governwealth,15
NA,ment will be able to assist ils work in,15
NA,Territory. I understand that that letter,15
NA,is under consideration by the association,15
NA,at the present time.,15
NA,PUBLIC SERVICE.,15
Mr DRUMMOND , I preface a ques-,15
NA,tion addressed to the Minister for Primary,15
NA,Industry by stating that I have been in-,15
NA,- formed that certain amalgamations of,15
NA,State and Commonwealth meat inspection,15
NA,services are being arranged. I ask the,15
NA,Minister whether it is a fact that the Com-,15
NA,monwealth meat inspectors organization is,15
NA,gravely concerned at the possibility that,15
NA,the seniority rights of Commonwealth in-,15
NA,spectors will be affected by this change-,15
NA,"over. If he has been so advised, can he",15
NA,inform the House of the actual position?,15
NA,"If he has not been so advised, will he have",15
NA,the necessary inquiries made so that the,15
NA,fair thing may be done in this case?,15
Mr MENZIES, I hope that I do not,15
NA,"intervene improperly, but, on Tuesday, the",15
NA,honorable member for Griffith put a ques-,15
NA,tion to me on this matter.,15
NA,Mr Thompson -W e have all had the,15
NA,same letter.,15
Mr MENZIES , I dare say. I was pro-,15
NA,"posing, this morning, to answer the ques-",15
NA,tion. I may not completely cover the ques-,15
NA,"tion now put, in which case my colleague",15
NA,can add to what I say.,15
NA,"On 24th October, the honorable member",15
NA,for Griffith asked me about representations,15
NA,from the Meat Inspectors Association con-,15
NA,cerning their seniority within the Com-,15
NA,monwealth Public Service in relation to,15
NA,certain inspectors at the Metropolitan and,15
NA,"Export Abattoirs Board, Gepps Cross, South",15
NA,"Australia. I understand that, following dis-",15
NA,not cussions at the Australian Agricultural,15
NA,Council concerning the elimination of over-,15
NA,lapping in meat inspection activities between,15
NA,"on Commonwealth and State authorities, the",15
NA,"Metropolitan and Export Abattoirs Board,",15
NA,"Cross, South Australia, approached",15
NA,"the Commonwealth, in 1960, about the",15
NA,possibility of the Commonwealth under-,15
NA,taking the inspection of meat for home,15
NA,"consumption at Gepps Cross. Since then,",15
NA,discussions relating to possible arrangements,15
NA,been proceeding between the Common-,15
NA,Department of Primary Industry and,15
NA,the the Metropolitan and Export Abattoirs,15
NA,Board. When these negotiations have been,15
NA,"completed, the Public Service Board will",15
NA,examine the terms and conditions for,15
NA,"employees, including seniority.",15
NA,AIR TRAVEL BY MEMBERS.,15
NA,NA,15
NA,the Interior: Who were the members of,15
NA,this Parliament who used Qantas Empire,15
NA,Airways Limited in preference to Ausshort,16
NA,tralian internal airlines when travelling,16
NA,between Darwin and Sydney? Why was the,16
NA,honorable gentleman afraid to give me,16
NA,"information I sought on 12th September,",16
NA,"1961, on the notice-paper, in reference",16
NA,costs of travelling by Ministers?,16
Mr FREETH , I am not afraid to give,16
NA,"the honorable member information, but so",16
NA,long as members of this Parliament use their,16
NA,travel privileges in the way in which they,16
NA,"are entitled to do so, I do not propose",16
NA,disclose such details to the honorable,16
NA,member.,16
NA,IMMIGRATION.,16
Mr WENTWORTH,Ha s the attention the,16
NA,of the Minister for Immigration been,16
NA,directed to the fact that the winner of,16
NA,""" Miss Australia"" quest yesterday came",16
NA,originally as a new Australian girl to this,16
NA,country with her family and in 1958,16
NA,"naturalized in Manly, in my electorate,",16
NA,where she now resides? Since this judgaction,16

Mr DOWNER , I am sure that many in,16
NA,"honorable members, and certainly myself,",16
NA,share the joy of the honorable member for,16
NA,Mackellar at this great success of Miss,16
NA,Tania Verstak. I would like to say to if,16
NA,"my honorable friend that, perhaps anticiis",16
NA,"pating his own thoughts in this direction, in such cases?",16
NA,I have already sent a message of congratu-,16
NA,lation to this attractive young lady. I am,16
NA,"sure, Mr Speaker, that we have heard with",16
NA,much interest that Miss Verstak is a,16
NA,stituent of the honorable member for,16
NA,Mackellar. Perhaps the honorable memnotice.,16
NA,ber might consider doing this: At the,16
NA,inauguration of the new Parliament next,16
NA,"year, he might ask his distinguished conof",16
NA,stituent to come down here. I am sure,16
NA,that her advent to Canberra would be,16
NA,"very happy event, a great stimulus to the",16
NA,"Government, and some balm for the disnot",16
NA,appointment of honorable members oppomy,16

NA,HOUSING.,16
Mr JAMES ,M y question is directed,16
NA,the Minister for the Interior. He will recall,16
NA,that I asked him a similar question some,16
NA,"time ago. As a matter of urgency, will",16
NA,he give a decision instead of awaiting a,16
NA,"decision by his department, in connexion",16
NA,with the immediate use of the twenty-odd,16
NA,"home units at Rathmines air base, in the",16
NA,"to electorate of Robertson, so that the acute",16
NA,housing shortage in the area may be,16
NA,relieved?,16
Mr FREETH ,A t this stage I have no,16
NA,further information to add to that which 1,16
NA,"have already given the honorable mersber,",16
NA,to but I will examine the request he has made.,16
NA,SECURITY.,16
Mr TURNER, I direct a question to,16
NA,Attorney-General. It relates to security.,16
NA,In a written answer handed to me to-day to,16
NA,"the a question that I asked, upon notice, the",16
NA,"honorable gentleman has revealed, inter alia,",16
NA,that in the United Kingdom and the United,16
NA,was States of America committees have been,16
NA,set up to review cases where administrative,16
NA,has been taken against individuals on,16
NA,"grounds, that such -committees are",16
NA,"advisory only, and that they relate only to",16
NA,"his public servants. I now ask him: First,",16
NA,has any consideration been given to the,16
NA,setting up of a committee along those lines,16
NA,"this country? Secondly, is it the practice",16
NA,of the United Kingdom and United States,16
NA,Governments not to give reasons for deci-,16
NA,"sions made on security grounds? Thirdly,",16
NA,"this is so, can he state the reasons why it",16
NA,the established practice not to give reasons,16
Sir GARFIELD BARWICK , I appreci-,16
NA,ate the spirit in which the honorable member,16
NA,conasks me this question. He has had from,16
NA,me a fairly full answer to his question on,16
NA,"The two tribunals which are set up,",16
NA,one in the United Kingdom and one in the,16
NA,"United States of America, are of the nature",16
NA,"public service tribunals, and were the",16
NA,appointment of such tribunals to be con-,16
NA,a sidered in this country the matter would,16
NA,"fall within my sole jurisdiction, if in",16
NA,jurisdiction at all. I do not know for,16
NA,"certain whether, in connexion with the",16
NA,"Public Service, such a proposal was con-",16
NA,"sidered at an earlier stage, but I have an",16
NA,"idea that it was and that it was dealt with,",16
NA,"to for good reason, by the Minister then in",16
NA,charge of the Public Service. I shall in-,16
NA,quire about that aspect of the honorable,16
NA,member's question and let him know the,17
NA,answer by letter. As to the honorable,17
NA,"member's second question, apart from",17
NA,"Public Service cases, neither the Governcapacity",17
NA,ment of the United States of America,17
NA,nor the United Kingdom Government gives,17
NA,"any reason, where it deals with a matter",17
NA,what I might call a negative way for refusing,17
NA,to do something on security grounds. Of,17
NA,"course, in the case of a public servant,",17
NA,grounds are known for the purposes of the,17
NA,tribunal concerned.,17
NA,"As to the last question, I am afraid that",17
NA,in the time I ought properly to take in,17
NA,"answering a question without notice, I cannot",17
NA,canvass all the reasons of policy that are,17
NA,involved. I am sure the honorable member,17
NA,"will at once realize that when a body,",17
NA,whether a public service body or any,17
NA,"body, acts upon a security report or a",17
NA,"security view, it is not dealing with rights",17
NA,which are enforceable in a court. Such,17
NA,body is dealing with something of a precaumatter.,17
NA,"tionary, protective or preventive nature, and",17
NA,in those circumstances I think it has only to,17
NA,be thought of to be agreed that the body,17
NA,"would not reveal the reasons publicly,",17
NA,or even to the person concerned.,17
NA,We have had an example here of a,17
NA,person being hurt because others have sought,17
NA,to force a disclosure or to make capital,17
NA,of the failure to disclose.,17
NA,"Matters of security, of their very nature,",17
NA,"involve sources of information, reliable",17
NA,"slout, which cannot be disclosed without",17
NA,destroying the sources and the very security,17
NA,"system. Lastly, there is a further question",17
NA,that leaps to mind in connexion with any,17
NA,matter involving security. It is a question,17
NA,of the balance that has to be achieved,17
NA,any responsible Minister who has to,17
NA,up his mind on such matters-an d for my,17
NA,part I can assure honorable members,17
NA,I do try to strike a correct balance-betwee,17
NA,the freedom of the private individual and,17
NA,the need to protect the country as a whole.,17
NA,This is always a very delicate and difficult,17
NA,balance. But if one reaches a point at,17
NA,which the benefit of the doubt must be,17
NA,given in a case clearly involving the,17
NA,"national interest, then I suppose responsible",17
NA,authorities in other countries would do,17
NA,"I would do, and give the country as a",17
NA,whole the benefit of the doubt.,17
NA,WAR SERVICE HOMES.,17
Mr GRIFFITHS ,M y question is,17
NA,directed to the Prime Minister in his,17
NA,as Leader of the Government.,17
NA,Will the right honorable gentleman discuss,17
NA,with the appropriate Minister the policy fol-,17
NA,in lowed in considering applications for second,17
NA,assistance under the War Service Homes,17
NA,Act? Will he particularly consider the case,17
NA,the of a person who received a maximum loan,17
NA,"and who, through circumstances beyond his",17
NA,"control, such as serious illness or change of",17
NA,"employment, was later compelled to dis-",17
NA,charge his mortgage? In view of the severe,17
NA,"hardships suffered by such borrowers, will",17
NA,the Prime Minister consider granting second,17
NA,assistance in such cases to the extent of the,17
NA,amount owing to the War Service Homes,17
NA,Division at the date of the discharge of,17
NA,other the mortgage in the first instance?,17
Mr MENZIES , I will be very glad to,17
NA,a have a talk with my colleague about this,17
NA,BROADCASTING.,17
Mr KING , I wish to ask the Post-,17
NA,master-General a question. In view of,17
NA,"the popularity of the session "" Meet the",17
NA,"Press"" on commercial broadcasting sta-",17
NA,"out tions 3DB and 3LK, which was formerly",17
NA,"broadcast at 9.30 p.m. on Sundays, but",17
NA,is now broadcast at 5.30 p.m. on Sun-,17
NA,"days, will the Minister get in touch with",17
NA,and the station managements in an endeavour,17
NA,to have the programme transmitted at the,17
NA,"time at which it was formerly broadcast,",17
NA,as many listeners are now unable to enjoy,17
NA,this important educational programme?,17
Mr DAVIDSON ,Naturall y I do not,17
NA,by know of the circumstances referred to by,17
NA,make the honorable member. I should think,17
NA,that the decision to change the broadcast-,17
NA,that ing time would have been made by the,17
NA,n station managements after pretty careful,17
NA,"examination of all relevant factors, par-",17
NA,ticularly that of ensuring that such a popu-,17
NA,lar programme was allotted a good listen-,17
NA,"ing time. However, as the honorable mem-",17
NA,"ber has asked me to look at the position,",17
NA,I shall be glad to contact the proprietors,17
NA,"and find out the reasons for the change,",17
NA,as and also submit to them the representa-,17
NA,tions implicit in the honorable member's,17
NA,question.,17
NA,AUSTRALIAN AIRLINES.,18
NA,Mr L. R. JOHNSON - I direct a ques-,18
NA,tion to the Minister representing the,18
NA,Minister for Civil Aviation. Will Trans-,18
NA,"Australia Airlines be compelled, under the",18
NA,"rationalization policy, to cancel its adver-",18
NA,"tising with the Sydney "" Daily Mirror""",18
NA,"and the Adelaide "" News "", now that Ansett",18
NA,has revenged himself upon those news-,18
NA,papers by cancelling his advertising in,18
NA,them?,18
Mr TOWNLEY ,Trans-Australi a Air-,18
NA,lines handles its own advertising without,18
NA,any direction from the Government.,18
NA,PENNANT HILLS POST OFFICE.,18
Mr WHEELER ,Wil l the Postmaster-,18
NA,General re-examine the question of the,18
NA,provision of a new post office at Pennant,18
NA,"Hills in my electorate, where there is a",18
NA,general desire to see a new building be-,18
NA,fitting the needs of the district?,18
Mr DAVIDSON , I remember that,18
NA,"some considerable time ago, at the re-",18
NA,quest of the honorable member for Mitchell,18
NA,"and in his company, I visited the district",18
NA,and inspected the Pennant Hills Post Office.,18
NA,I told him at the time that while the de-,18
NA,partment appreciated the need for a new,18
NA,"post office at Pennant Hills, it was not",18
NA,possible to include the project in its pro-,18
NA,gramme for the current year because of,18
NA,more pressing needs for other buildings,18
NA,and other works. On several occasions,18
NA,"since that visit, the honorable member",18
NA,bas made representations to me about a,18
NA,new post office and I have informed him,18
NA,mat the position had not materially,18
NA,changed. I shall be glad to accede to his,18
NA,iatest request and to examine the position,18
NA,again.,18
NA,LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE.,18
Mr DUTHIE , I should like to ask the,18
NA,Treasurer a question. Is the right honor-,18
NA,able gentleman aware that local govern-,18
NA,"ment authorities, in Tasmania in particu-",18
NA,"lar, are facing substantial cuts in municipal",18
NA,projects because the normal lending,18
NA,"agencies, especially the banking system,",18
NA,will not lend to them as readily as pre-,18
NA,viously? It appears that these agencies,18
NA,are still waiting for approval by the Reserve,18
NA,Bank of Australia to let them release,18
NA,"essential credit. At least, that is the",18
NA,excuse. Some councils have obtained only,18
NA,"one-quarter, and others one-third, of their",18
NA,requirements. Will the Treasurer imme-,18
NA,diately have this desperate situation inves-,18
NA,"tigated, and will he instruct the banks to",18
NA,lend to local government authorities for,18
NA,essential purposes?,18
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,Whe n I last,18
NA,"inquired into this matter, the information",18
NA,that I received indicated that funds were,18
NA,"flowing more freely and in greater volume,",18
NA,"taken in total, to local government bor-",18
NA,rowers up to this stage of the present,18
NA,financial year than in the previous financial,18
NA,year. I shall endeavour to ascertain the,18
NA,position in Tasmania. The reason which,18
NA,the honorable gentleman suggests has been,18
NA,"advanced astonishes me, because the trad-",18
NA,"ing banks of this country, far from await-",18
NA,ing some release of funds by the Reserve,18
NA,"Bank of Australia, probably have not been,",18
NA,"for years past, in a more liquid situation",18
NA,at this stage of a financial year.,18
NA,PATENTS.,18
Mr FOX ,M y question is addressed,18
NA,to the Attorney-General. Has his attention,18
NA,been directed to a Dutch proposal which,18
NA,is designed to speed up the processing of,18
NA,"patent applications? Under this plan,",18
NA,patent applications would be published,18
NA,"after they had been filed, but a patent",18
NA,would not actually be issued on the filing,18
NA,"until a necessity for the issuing was shown,",18
NA,and so time would not be wasted in pro-,18
NA,cessing applications for patents which,18
NA,would never be used. Will the Minister,18
NA,consider submitting to this Parliament,18
NA,legislation designed to introduce this kind,18
NA,of system in Australia?,18
Sir GARFIELD BARWICK , I do,18
NA,know of this proposal. It is not a new,18
NA,idea in patent law. Such a system has,18
NA,been in existence in some places on the,18
NA,"Continent, and I have given it some con-",18
NA,"sideration. It has some advantages, par-",18
NA,ticularly where the number of applications,18
NA,is so great as to make it impossible for the,18
NA,Patent Office to process them in a reason-,18
NA,"able time. But, on the whole, as at present",18
NA,"advised, I think it preferable that we",18
NA,adhere to our existing system of issuing,18
NA,letters patent only after examination by,18
NA,the Patent Office. This system has a num-,19
NA,ber of advantages for inventors. I had,19
NA,proposed to introduce legislation during,19
NA,this sessional period in order to make,19
NA,"amendments in the Patents Act, but, owing",19
NA,"to the pressure of business, the drafting",19
NA,of the measure could not be completed,19
NA,time. I propose to include in that legisber,19
NA,"lation provisions which, I think, will",19
NA,vide the advantages which the system men-,19
NA,tioned by the honorable member has for,19
NA,inventors and preserve the advantages,19
NA,"which our present system has for them,",19
NA,"so that, in a sense, inventors may enjoy",19
NA,the best of both worlds.,19
NA,UNIFORM COMPANY LAW.,19
Mr CAIRNS , I ask the Attorneyand,19
NA,General a question. Has he seen a report,19
NA,"of a statement by Sir Arthur Warner, the",19
NA,Minister in the Legislative Council of,19
NA,Victorian Parliament who is responsible,19
NA,"company law, that it was most unlikely",19
NA,that the Commonwealth Attorney-General's,19
NA,proposals would be sufficiently advanced,19
NA,permit their consideration this year? I,19
NA,ask: When did this Government first,19
NA,announce that it was concerned to draft,19
NA,legislation to deal with restrictive,19
NA,"practices? Is it a fact, as the Victorian",19
NA,"Minister says, that the continuing delay",19
NA,arises because the Commonwealth proposals,19
NA,are not ready? Can the Attorney-General,19
NA,assure the House that he is genuinely con-,19
NA,cerned to legislate to prevent restrictive trade,19
NA,"practices, or is this whole business what",19
NA,the Prime Minister would describe as a,19
NA,political stunt?,19
Sir GARFIELD BARWICK , The opportunities,19
NA,Governor-General's Speech of more than,19
NA,eighteen months ago contained a promise,19
NA,that we would look into this matter and conof people.,19
NA,sider preparing legislation to ensure that,19
NA,free enterprise was protected against restric-,19
NA,tive trade practices. That promise has,19
NA,been honoured to the full. I have devoted,19
NA,much time to ascertaining in great detail,19
NA,what is going on in the community,19
NA,"respect to these practices, to devising a con-",19
NA,"crete scheme, to discussing the matter with",19
NA,the Attorneys-General of the States and to by,19
NA,preparing proposals for the Government to,19
NA,consider. There is no question of any they,19
NA,political stunt here. I am quite sure that,19
NA,the honorable gentleman will be disapfor,19
NA,pointed to find that we are doing something. for,19
NA,Mr Bryant -W e shall be surprised.,19
Sir GARFIELD BARWICK ,Honorabl e,19
NA,"gentlemen opposite will be surprised, per-",19
NA,"haps, and certainly disappointed, to find that",19
NA,we are doing something that will be effec-,19
NA,in tive. I am sure that the honorable mem-,19
NA,for Yarra will be disappointed that we,19
NA,prodo not follow the path of the socialists.,19
NA,"EDUCATIONAL, SOCIAL AND",19
NA,ECONOMIC ADVANCEMENT IN,19
NA,PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA.,19
Mr HASLUCK ,Curtin-Ministe r for,19
NA,Territories) -b y leave-Havin g reviewed,19
NA,current planning for the Territory of Papua,19
NA,"New Guinea, the Government has de-",19
NA,cided to indicate the trend of progress dur-,19
NA,ing the next five years. This is in keeping,19
NA,"the with our undertaking to give "" realistic",19
NA,for target dates for various stages in educa-,19
NA,"tional, social and economic advancement "".",19
NA,Current planning is founded on major,19
NA,to achievements in all these fields since the,19
NA,"now war and, like all earlier planning, is an",19
NA,extension of work already completed or,19
NA,commenced. Performance and promise are,19
NA,trade inseparably linked.,19
NA,The present announcement concerns a,19
NA,five-year period from the commencement,19
NA,"of the financial year 1962-63 to 30th June,",19
NA,"1967, for, although our planning goes be-",19
NA,"yond the five-year period, change Jn the",19
NA,Territory is so rapid and there are so many,19
NA,unpredictable factors that it would be un-,19
NA,realistic not to allow for adjustments from,19
NA,time to time to take advantage of new,19
NA,or to meet new needs. In our,19
NA,view any planning that affects people should,19
NA,be flexible enough to meet the actual needs,19
NA,Australian policy has been clearly and,19
NA,firmly stated on many occasions. May I,19
NA,recall to the House the following statement,19
NA,made to it by the Prime Minister ( Mr.,19
NA,with Menzies) on 27th April this year:-,19
NA,"In our own New Guinea territories, our policy is,",19
NA,steady degrees and up to the limits of our,19
NA,"financial and administrative capacity, to promote",19
NA,the advancement of the people so that ultimately,19
NA,will choose for themselves their own consti-,19
NA,tution and their future relationship with us. VVe,19
NA,"will respect their choice whatever it may be. This,",19
NA,"us, is not a new policy. We have pursued it",19
NA,"years. It arises from our sense of responsibility,",19
NA,a responsibility which cannot be suddenly or,20
NA,maturely abandoned if our trusteeship is to be,20
NA,honorably performed.,20
NA,We are continuing on this course for we,20
NA,believe that we have great and honorable,20
NA,responsibilities to the people of the Trust,20
NA,Territory and to the people of our own,20
NA,Territory of Papua; we have faith in Aus-,20
NA,tralia's wisdom and capacity to discharge,20
NA,those responsibilities; and we are fortified,20
NA,by the trust which the people themselves,20
NA,have expressed in our administration and,20
NA,the reliance they place on our partnership,20
NA,with them. Pursuing this policy with all the,20
NA,"vigour and resources at our command, and",20
NA,relating our efforts closely to the response,20
NA,"made by the people themselves, we antici-",20
NA,pate that during the five years ending on,20
NA,"June 30, 1967, we shall see the progress",20
NA,described in this statement. One of the,20
NA,major features of that progress will be the,20
NA,increased participation by the indigenous,20
NA,people themselves in the work of advancing,20
NA,their own welfare.,20
NA,"In the five years ending on June 30, 1967,",20
NA,we expect the recruitment of not fewer than,20
NA,"2,000 expatriate staff and not fewer than",20
NA,"2,500 indigenous staff to the Territory Pub-",20
NA,lic Service. This is intended to give a,20
NA,"total Territory public service, after allow-",20
NA,"ing for retirement and wastage, of approxi-",20
NA,"mately 10,000, of whom 33.4 per cent, will",20
NA,be indigenous public servants compared,20
NA,"with the present percentage of 12.5 per cent,",20
NA,"at June 30, 1961. These figures relate to",20
NA,the.public service as at present constructed.,20
NA,Indigenous career workers are also employed,20
NA,"at present under the designation of "" ad-",20
NA,"ministration servants"", outside the Public",20
NA,"Service. This category, which includes",20
NA,"teachers, clerical assistants, field workers in",20
NA,"agriculture, lands and forestry, health assist-",20
NA,"ants, drivers, postal workers,firemen,store-",20
NA,"men and tradesmen, is expected to rise in",20
NA,"the five-year period from 9,000 to a total",20
NA,"of 10,000. Consideration is being given to",20
NA,"a proposal that these 10,000 workers,",20
NA,"described at present as "" administrative ser-",20
NA,"vants "", should become officers of a new",20
NA,division to be created in the Public Service,20
NA,broadly comparable to the fourth division,20
NA,of the Commonwealth Public Service. If,20
NA,"this were done, and we built up to a total",20
NA,"Public Service of 20,000, the proportion of",20
NA,"indigenes in the Public Service, as expanded",20
NA,"preby the creation of the new division, would",20
NA,be 66.7 per cent.,20
NA,A central administrative training college,20
NA,is to be established by 1963 without dis-,20
NA,turbing the existing training institutions for,20
NA,"the post office, police, education, agricul-",20
NA,"tural, forestry, local government, co-opera-",20
NA,tive and medical services. It is expected,20
NA,"that by June, 1967, the number of in-",20
NA,digenous members of Administration staffs,20
NA,in training in all institutions will have been,20
NA,raised to an enrolment of not less than,20
NA,"3,500.",20
NA,Tn education our aim is to raise the total,20
NA,"school enrolments from 150,000 to 350,000",20
NA,and to continue to improve the standards,20
NA,and efficiency of schools. This five-year,20
NA,programme is part of further planning which,20
NA,is intended to lead by the end of 1975 to a,20
NA,situation in which the whole of the children,20
NA,"of school age, estimated to be approximately",20
NA,"750,000 by that date, will be within reach",20
NA,of schools. [Quorum formed.],20
NA,During thefive-yearterm up to the end,20
NA,"of 1967 secondary schools, technical schools",20
NA,and professional training are to be developed,20
NA,in keeping with the demand for post-,20
NA,primary education from children who have,20
NA,received an efficient primary education.,20
NA,Special attention will be given to teacher,20
NA,training to turn out increased numbers of,20
NA,qualified indigenous teachers. The extent,20
NA,of this effort is to be limited only by the,20
NA,number of suitable and qualified candidates,20
NA,offering. The estimate is that by the end,20
NA,of thefive-yearperiod the enrolments will,20
NA,rise to-,20
NA,"Post-primary and secondary schools .. 10,000",20
NA,"Technical schools .. .. .. 2,000",20
NA,"Teacher training schools .. .. 2,000",20
NA,It is estimated that during the five-year,20
NA,"period a total of 4,500 indigenous teachers",20
NA,will be trained.,20
NA,"In health, all items in the programme for",20
NA,construction of base or regional hospitals,20
NA,and special hospitals have already been com-,20
NA,pleted or commenced. Besides completing,20
NA,"work in progress, and rebuilding the older",20
NA,"base and district hospitals, in the next five",20
NA,years ft is intended to move on to the con-,20
NA,struction of other smaller hospitals. It is,20
NA,"planned to build 70 hospitals, the major",20
NA,items being 49 new rural hospitals. This,20
NA,would bring the total number of hospitals To,21
NA,260. To bring medical services closer to,21
NA,the people we expect that 340 additional,21
NA,"medical aid posts will be built, making a",21
NA,"total of over 2,000. The number of infant",21
NA,"and maternal welfare centres, under both",21
NA,"the Administration and the missions, is to",21
NA,be raised from 150 to about 200. Each of,21
NA,these centres extends its work to all,21
NA,accessible villages in its vicinity by means,21
NA,of travelling clinics. The recent commence-,21
NA,"ment made in establishing "" rural health",21
NA,"centres "" with local or community assistance",21
NA,will be followed up to bring the total of,21
NA,such centres to twenty. Other targets are,21

NA,I appreciate the repeated efforts of,21
NA,honorable member for East Sydney ( Mr.,21

NA,"operate, each surveying 40,000 to 50,000",21
NA,people per annum giving a total of approxi100,21
NA,"mately 1,250,000 surveyed or resurveyed",21
NA,"by 1967, with all cases under treatment.",21
NA,cases of leprosy in the Territory will be,21
NA,veyed and under treatment by 1966-67.,21
NA,Staff targets are to raise the number of,21
NA,"doctors from 100 to 180, assistant medical",21
NA,"practitioners from eleven to 44, European",21
NA,"nurses from 220 to 280, indigenous nurses",21
NA,trained in the Territory Medical School from,21
NA,"30 to 550, both male and female, and",21
NA,European medical assistants from 170 to,21
NA,200. Apart from the recruitment of,21
NA,"European doctors, the major effort will be",21
NA,put into the selection and training of indi-,21
NA,genous candidates both as assistant medical,21
NA,practitioners and as nurses. The ground-,21
NA,work in the coming five years is intended to,21
NA,lead towards a major build-up of the figures,21
NA,in both categories in the succeeding five,21
NA,years. This effort will give a proportion of,21
NA,"one "" doctor "", including the assistant medi-",21
NA,"cal practitioners under the designation, for",21
NA,"approximately every 10,000 of the popula-",21
NA,and of one trained member of the medical,21
NA,"staff for approximately every 1,750 of the",21
NA,population. These figures are approximate,21
NA,because the population will be increasing in,21
NA,the period.,21
NA,"In native affairs, it is intended to bring",21
NA,"the whole of the Territory "" under influence """,21
NA,"by the end of 1963 and "" under control "" by",21
NA,the end of 1966. This would mean increas-,21
NA,ing the number of patrol posts from 71 to,21
NA,num89. The extension of native local govern-,21
NA,to ment councils is planned to increase the,21
NA,population served by such councils from,21
NA,"about 380,000 to about 800,000. Associated",21
NA,with these councils are many ancillary,21
NA,activities through which the people become,21
NA,the active in social and economic affairs.,21
NA,Economic targets are expressed in esti-,21
NA,mates of production and trade; in adminis-,21
NA,"trative measures, principally those such as",21
NA,extension and marketing services,21
NA,"under the Department of Agriculture, Stock",21
NA,and Fisheries; and in construction of basic,21
NA,"facilities such as roads, wharfs, airfields,",21
NA,propower and water supplies and postal and,21
NA,of telegraphic communication. Production,21
NA,figures will naturally react to changes in,21
NA,world prices and according to access to,21
NA,markets. Present indications of the quantity,21
NA,"production are 100 per cent, increase in",21
NA,"production of cocoa between 1961 and 1963,",21
NA,"per cent, increase in coffee between",21
NA,",1961 and 1963, 50 per cent, increase in",21
NA,"All rubber between 1961 and 1966, 50 per cent,",21
NA,surincrease in production of logs between 1961,21
NA,"and 1964, and 50 per cent, increase in pro-",21
NA,duction of sawn timber between 1961 and,21
NA,"1965, whilst production of plywood will",21
NA,remain stable and production of copra,21
NA,should show a minor increase of about,22
NA,6 per cent.,22
NA,The target in land development is over,22
NA,7.500 new blocks for native settlement in,22
NA,the next five years involving the investiga-,22
NA,"tion by lands officers of over 250,000 acres.",22
NA,This is to provide opportunity for those,22
NA,native farmers who do not have access to,22
NA,suitable land under customary native land,22
NA,tenure. There will be continued intensive,22
NA,effort to advance economic production by,22
NA,people already working ihcir own land. In,22
NA,"land matters, considerable room has to be",22
NA,left for flexibility. The objective is to,22
NA,sure opportunity and to give guidance to all,22
NA,indigenes who want to move inlo economic,22
NA,production either by better use of land they,22
NA,already occupy or by obtaining access to,22
NA,new blocks.,22
NA,Policy is to make the maximum effort,22
NA,towards local self-sufficiency in foodstuffs,22
NA,"and materials consumed in the Territory,",22
NA,while raising the standard of nutrition of,22
NA,the people; to increase exports to,22
NA,of available markets and to promote the,22
NA,local processing of products whether for,22
NA,local consumption or for export. Honor-,22
NA,able members will realize the importance,22
NA,of this maximum economic effort both to,22
NA,sustain the higher level of expenditure in,22
NA,the Territory and to ensure employment and,22
NA,remuneration to support the higher standard,22
NA,of living lo which the people are advancing.,22
NA,"In animal industry, the target is to increase",22
NA,cattle numbers both by importation and,22
NA,"breeding lo 50,000 in five years. This is",22
NA,associated with plans for the distribution of,22
NA,"2,500 cattle to native caitle projects and the",22
NA,production and distribution of pigs and,22
NA,poultry.,22
NA,"In the Agricultural Department, agricul-",22
NA,tural extension work is to be accelerated,22
NA,by increasing the number of agricultural,22
NA,"exiension siations from eleven to fifteen,",22
NA,agricultural extension centres from 45 to,22
NA,"110, the number of agricultural colleges",22
NA,"from one to four, and the number of",22
NA,"expatriate staff, mostly experts, from 157",22
NA,to 320. This work will result in raising the,22
NA,standard of native farming and increasing,22
NA,production. The target is to have an enrol-,22
NA,ment of 100 indigenous students taking an,22
NA,"agricultural diploma course, 120 in a formal",22
NA,course at a level below the diploma in,22
NA,agriculture; and 1.500 in training as prac-,22
NA,tical farmers. These figures are for the,22
NA,training position at any given time. Two,22
NA,fisheries stations will be established and the,22
NA,expatriate staff increased to 26.,22
NA,We propose to spend substantial sums of,22
NA,money to provide basic services required,22
NA,"for economic advancement, such as roads,",22
NA,"bridges, electric power generation, water",22
NA,"supplies, wharfs and aerodromes.",22
NA,The purpose behind this planning is to,22
NA,"improve the living standards, education and",22
NA,health of the people and to set them more,22
NA,firmly on the path towards the goal of,22
NA,en- being able to govern themselves and to,22
NA,support themselves; and to do both in a,22
NA,way that will give to all residents of the,22
NA,Territory the opportunity to live in their,22
NA,"own land in peace, free from fear and",22
NA,"want, dealing justly with all men.",22

NA,Debate resumed from 24th October (vide,23

NA,That the bill be now read a second time.,23
Mr WARD ,East Sydney) [11.40] -A,23
NA,this is the last day of the sitting of,23
NA,Parliament and most likely the last day,23
NA,which the present Government will have,23
NA,"control of national affairs, and as there",23
NA,still many important matters to which,23
NA,Opposition members desire to direct attenlong,23
NA,"tion, it is not our purpose to delay this",23
NA,measure for any great length of time.,23
NA,"do not oppose the Government's proposal,",23
NA,"but we have certain criticisms, not directly",23
NA,"associated with the proposal, to present.",23
NA,The Commonwealth intends to spend ready to proceed.,23
NA,"£1.325,000 on the provision of new diesel",23
NA,locomotives and ore trucks for use on a,23
NA,section of the South Australian railway.,23
NA,As it is expected that there will be an annual,23
NA,"saving of £483,000 in operating costs,",23
NA,appears to be a wise decision. But we must,23
NA,have regard to the general attitude of,23
NA,Government to the great work of standardizStales,23
NA,ing our Australian railways. As with other,23
NA,"national problems, the Government has",23
NA,been lacking in energy and a desire to,23
NA,ment the plans. I am of the opinion that,23
NA,we are moving so slowly towards the,23
NA,standardization of our rail gauges that no,23
NA,one could possibly say when the task is,23
NA,"likely to be completed, unless there is",23
NA,change of government. When Labour left,23
NA,"office in 1949, it had been working for",23
NA,number of years towards the solution of,23
NA,"transport problems, and some progress had",23
NA,"been made. We had not, of course, made",23
NA,as much progress as we would have liked,23
NA,to have made. I readily admit that all the,23
NA,responsibility for the delay has not rested,23
NA,with the Commonwealth Parliament. The,23
NA,constitutional difficulties and the difficulties,23
NA,of negotiating with six States present trelittle,23
NA,"mendous problems, and no one knows this",23
NA,"better than I do, because 1 was Minister",23
NA,Transport in the Labour Government.,23
NA,We had innumerable discussions and,23
NA,tiations in an effort to make some progress,23
NA,with this great work. We actually secured,23
NA,the signature of the six State representatives,23
NA,who signed an agreement on behalf of their,23
NA,governments. The agreement was to be,23
NA,binding on the six States and on the Com-,23
NA,"monwealth but, of course, it would not",23
NA,have effect until after the State parliaments,23
NA,"had ratified it. Unfortunately, many of the",23
NA,States-thi s is not confined to governments,23
NA,of any one political colour-hesitate d or,23
NA,s delayed in accepting what we regarded as,23
NA,the a most generous agreement. It dealt in,23
NA,on most generous terms with the financial,23
NA,are arrangements with the States for the carry-,23
NA,"ing out of the work. At last, in 1949, not",23
NA,"before we left office, one State govern-",23
NA,ment recognized the benefits that it could,23
NA,We obtain from this scheme. That was the,23
NA,South Australian Government under the,23
NA,present Premier. Sir Thomas Playford. As,23
NA,"I have said, all States signed the agreement",23
NA,and the South Australian Government was,23
NA,"At that time, no one believed there was",23
NA,any necessity to write any time-table into,23
NA,the agreement. No one thought it necessary,23
NA,this to say how the work was to proceed and,23
NA,when it was to be completed. We naturally,23
NA,"the assumed, because of the interest of the",23
NA,"over many conferences, that they",23
NA,with the Commonwealth would be anxious,23
NA,to proceed with these great undertakings.,23
NA,impleOnce the agreement was ratified by the,23
NA,"States, it was expected that the work would",23
NA,"commence almost immediately. However,",23
NA,"as soon as Labour left office, this Govern-",23
NA,ment evidently decided not to proceed with,23
NA,a the work or at any rate certainly not to,23
NA,proceed with any rapidity. The scheme,23
NA,a was recommended by a man who was prob-,23
NA,the ably the greatest railway authority this,23
NA,country has produced. I refer to the late,23
NA,Sir Harold Clapp. He played a big part,23
NA,in the preparation of the plan to modernize,23
NA,the Australian railway system. If the plan,23
NA,"had been adopted in those days, the stan-",23
NA,dardizing and modernizing of the railway,23
NA,system could have been completed for a,23
NA,"more than £200,000,000. It could not",23
NA,be done for that figure to-day. Despite the,23
NA,for assurance of the Prime Minister ( Mr.,23
NA,Menzies) that he would put value back into,23
NA,"negothe £1, every one knows that what would",23
NA,"have cost £200,000,000 in 1949 would most",23
NA,"likely cost about £800,000,000 now.",23
NA,What has this Government done? It,24
NA,may say that it has undertaken the stan-,24
NA,dardization of the rail gauge between Mel-,24
NA,"bourne and Sydney, and a small section",24
NA,of railway in South Australia has also,24
NA,been converted to standard gauge. But,24
NA,what else has it done? What is the most,24
NA,important link? Sir Harold Clapp found,24
NA,-hi s finding has been confirmed by suc-,24
NA,ceeding Commonwealth Commissioners for,24
NA,"Railways, as I will show in a moment-",24
NA,that the section between Broken Hill and,24
NA,Port Pirie was the most important section,24
NA,of the whole plan and should be given,24
NA,priority. What has this Government done,24
NA,"about this section? It provided £50,000",24
NA,for a survey of the route and we now,24
NA,have this measure which provides for the,24
NA,"expenditure of £1,325,000 on diesel loco-",24
NA,motives and a number of new ore trucks.,24
NA,So that the public will be impressed with,24
NA,the Government's desire to get on with,24
NA,"standardization, it is proposed that they",24
NA,shall have convertible bogies. When the,24
NA,"line is converted to standard gauge, this",24
NA,"rolling-stock, according to the Govern-",24
NA,"ment, could be converted for use on the",24
NA,standard gauge railway. But is it not a,24
NA,"fact, Mr Minister",24
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Wight).,24
NA,-Order ! The honorable member for East,24
NA,Sydney will address the Chair.,24
Mr WARD ,I s it not a fact that the we,24
NA,locomotives to be purchased as a result,24
NA,this legislation are suitable for the 3-ft.,24
NA,gauge only and are of such a character,24
NA,that it would be uneconomic to use them,24
NA,on the standard gauge railway?,24
NA,Mr Opperman -No .,24
Mr WARD ,Yes . If you ask your,24
NA,"authorities, you will find that much more",24
NA,powerful locomotives will be needed when,24
NA,you are carrying much greater loads on the,24
NA,line after it has been converted to standard,24
NA,"gauge. In any event, let me examine this",24
NA,matter from another aspect. Does the it,24
NA,Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr.,24
NA,Opperman) suggest that this rolling-stock,24
NA,will still be functioning when this section,24
NA,of line is converted to standard gauge?,24
NA,The rolling-stock will be in,24
NA,the line is so converted only if a Labour,24
NA,government takes office after the next eleclions.,24
NA,tion. 1 venture the opinion that if this,24
NA,"Government is still in control, the rolling-",24
NA,stock will wear out long before the South,24
NA,Australian railways are converted to stan-,24
NA,"dard gauge. As a matter of fact, a Liberal",24
NA,government is in control in South Aus-,24
NA,tralia. Is it not a fact that it has had to,24
NA,approach the High Court of Australia in,24
NA,an effort to compel this Government lo,24
NA,implement,24
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Order ! I,24
NA,remind tbe honorable gentleman that the,24
NA,subject he is now raising is sub judice. I,24
NA,ask him to confine his remarks to the terms,24
NA,"of the bill, which provides for an agree-",24
NA,ment on railway equipment.,24
Mr WARD ,Wit h all due respect to,24
NA,"you, Mr Depufy Speaker, I do not intend",24
NA,to discuss the matter that is now before,24
NA,the High Court. I merely mention that,24
NA,the South Australian Government was ob-,24
NA,liged to take action in the High Court to,24
NA,try to compel this Government to imple-,24
NA,ment an agreement which was entered inlo,24
NA,in 1949. No one will deny that. It is,24
NA,"a well-known fact. As a matter of fact,",24
NA,every one is now awaiting the court's,24
NA,judgment. The Government will act only,24
NA,when it is forced to take action.,24
NA,Surely every body knows the importance,24
NA,of this particular section of the line in what,24
NA,is known as the Peterborough division. If,24
NA,"had been still in office, this work certainly",24
NA,"of would have been undertaken, and no doubt",24
NA,6-in. would have been completed by now. To,24
NA,prove that this Government has no desire,24
NA,to press on with this important national,24
NA,"work, I point out that there have been no",24
NA,discussions between the Government and the,24
NA,"Silverton Tramway Company, or with the",24
NA,"New South Wales Government, since 1952.",24
NA,"Nine years have elapsed, and no action has",24
NA,been taken by the Government to continue,24
NA,negotiations with a view to acquiring this,24
NA,"important line, which is now operated by",24
NA,"the Silverton Tramway Company, and which",24
NA,is essential to obtain before the section,24
NA,between Broken Hill and Port Pirie can be,24
NA,completed. There is ample evidence to,24
NA,show thai the Government is neither sincere,24
NA,nor genuine in its professed desire to press,24
NA,service when on with this work.,24
NA,Let me now make one or two brief quota-,24
NA,In ihe report which he submitted in,24
NA,"1945, Sir Harold Clapp directed attention",24
NA,to the importance of this section of line. In,25
NA,"paragraph 38 on page 13, he said-",25
NA,The conversion of the Port Pirie-Broken Hill,25
NA,line,25
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Order ! I,25
NA,have already told the honorable member that,25
NA,he cannot refer to this section of line in con-,25
NA,"nexion with standardization, because that",25
NA,matter is now sub judice. This bill provides,25
NA,"specifically for equipment, and the only way",25
NA,in which it can be related to standardization,25
NA,is by reference to alterations to the equip-,25
NA,ment so that it may be used for either the,25
NA,3-ft. 6-in. gauge or the standard gauge line.,25
NA,I ask the honorable gentleman not to refer,25
NA,to a matter which is sub judice.,25
Mr WARD , I am not referring to a,25
NA,matter that is sub judice; I am referring to,25
NA,the recommendations that were contained in,25
NA,a report presented to this Parliament. This,25
NA,bill relates to the convertibility of this,25
NA,rolling-stock for use on the standard gauge,25
NA,"line. Therefore, I think I am entitled to",25
NA,discuss when this convertible rolling-stock,25
NA,will be required on the standard gauge rail-,25
NA,way. I want to impress on the House the,25
NA,fact that all the records that have been,25
NA,presented to this Parliament disclose without,25
NA,doubt that this section is regarded by rail-,25
NA,way authorities as being a most important,25
NA,"section of the standardization work, and that",25
NA,it should have been undertaken before now.,25
NA,Sir Harold Clapp said-,25
NA,The conversion of the Port Pirie-Broken Hill,25
NA,line (following the acquisition of the Silverton,25
NA,Tramway Company's Line) would shorten the,25
NA,standard gauge route between Perth and Sydney,25
NA,and all points north and north-west thereof by,25
NA,"256 miles. This work, if carried out, would not",25
NA,only confer advantages in defence transport but,25
NA,in case of emergency such as the cessation of,25
NA,"coastal shipping, would enable iron ore, now sent",25
NA,"by sea from Whyalla, to be overlanded from Port",25
NA,Pirie direct to Newcastle. Coal could also be,25
NA,sent in the reverse direction from New South,25
NA,Wales coalfields direct to Adelaide and to Port,25
NA,Pirie-thenc e also to Whyalla by boat. In the,25
NA,present war,25
NA,He was referring to the last war-,25
NA,the existence of this link would have been invaluable,25
NA,for defence transport purposes and would have,25
NA,contributed greatly to the movement of Australia's,25
NA,land forces between the east and the west of the,25
NA,continent.,25
NA,I prqpose to quote briefly from only two or,25
NA,"three of them, but if honorable members",25
NA,care to read all the reports that have been,25
NA,"presented, they will find that when Mr.",25
NA,Hannaberry was Commonwealth Commis-,25
NA,sioner for Railways he never failed to direct,25
NA,attention to the urgent need for doing some-,25
NA,thing with respect to this particular section,25
NA,"of line. In his annual report for 1952-53,",25
NA,Mr Hannaberry referred to the urgent need,25
NA,for pressing on with this important section,25
NA,of the line.,25
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Order ! The,25
NA,honorable member for East Sydney seems,25
NA,to be deliberately referring to this particular,25
NA,section of line in contravention of the ruling,25
NA,that I have given. I now rule that the,25
NA,honorable member for East Sydney may not,25
NA,"continue referring to this section of the line,",25
NA,as it is sub judice. He will restrict his,25
NA,remarks to the terms of the bill before the,25
NA,House.,25
Mr WARD ,Tha t is a rather remark-,25
NA,"able ruling. I am obliged to accept it, but",25
NA,I ask honorable members to consider what,25
NA,your ruling was. You have said that I,25
NA,cannot discuss this section of the line. And,25
NA,this is the very section of the line with,25
NA,which the legislation deals! 1 have never,25
NA,heard such an extraordinary ruling.,25
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Order !,25
Mr WARD , I understand your ruling,25
NA,"quite well, and I am obliged to accept it.",25
NA,But how can speeches continue? The bill,25
NA,refers to the Port Pirie to Broken Hill sec-,25
NA,"tion of the line and, according to your",25
NA,"ruling-i f you want to check it, you can",25
NA,"get the "" Hansard "" record- I am not per-",25
NA,mitted to discuss this section of the line.,25
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Order ! The,25
NA,honorable member is not in order in con-,25
NA,tinuing to canvass my ruling. I ask the,25
NA,honorable member to restrict his remarks to,25
NA,the bill before the House.,25
NA,Mr Whitlam -O n a point of order; I,25
NA,submit the honorable member is in,25
NA,order,25
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Order ! No,25
NA,point of order is involved. I gave a ruling.,25
NA,The honorable gentleman is out of order.,25
NA,I call the honorable member for East,25
NA,Sydney.,25
NA,Mr Whitlam - I want to put a point of,25
NA,view to you.,25
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Th e honor-,26
NA,able gentleman must raise a point of order,26
NA,if he wishes to do that. No point of order,26
NA,"has been raised. I gave a ruling, and I now",26
NA,call upon the honorable member for East,26
NA,Sydney to continue his remarks.,26
NA,Mr Whitlam -The n I take a point of,26
NA,order. There are proceedings at present,26
NA,"before the High Court, on which judg-",26
NA,ment has been reserved to decide whether,26
NA,the Commonwealth can be compelled by,26
NA,court to carry out obligations under,26
NA,1949 railway standardization agreement,26
NA,between the Commonwealth and South,26
NA,"Australia, and earlier agreements between",26
NA,those two governments. The point at,26
NA,is solely this: Can the Commonwealth,26
NA,compelled to carry out an agreement? It,26
NA,is the old issue whether governments are,26
NA,susceptible to compulsion by courts to act.,26
NA,It is not a question whether courts can,26
NA,prevent a government from doing someis,26
NA,thing; it is a question whether courts,26
NA,compel a government to do something.,26
NA,"That is the issue upon which, I understand, is drawn.",26
NA,the High Court has reserved its decision.,26
NA,The honorable member for East Sydney,26
NA,has directed his attention merely to,26
NA,question whether the Commonwealth should,26
NA,do it. If the honorable member were,26
NA,ing with the question whether the Combetween,26
NA,"monwealth should be made to do it, then,",26
NA,"of course, he would be speaking",26
NA,"of the Standing Orders. But, if he is",26
NA,merely advocating that the Commonwealth,26
NA,"should voluntarily carry out this agreement,",26
NA,he is not acting in breach of the Standing,26
NA,Orders and he is not in any way trespassing,26
NA,on the functions of the court. In those,26
NA,"cumstances, I submit that the honorable",26
NA,member for East Sydney is perfectly in,26
NA,order in referring to the desirability of,26
NA,Commonwealth financing this section,26
NA,"the railway, and that is all he has done",26
NA,"to this stage. I submit, therefore,",26
NA,should permit him to do it.,26
NA,Mr Freeth -Th e Deputy Leader of the,26
NA,Opposition has admitted that the matter,26
NA,which is before the court is the question,26
NA,whether the Commonwealth should be,26
NA,"compelled to undertake a certain project,",26
NA,"namely, the standardization of a particular",26
NA,section of railway. The honorable member,26
NA,"for East Sydney is trying to show that,",26
NA,whether the Commonwealth acts volunwith,26
NA,"tarily or in some other way, this particular",26
NA,section of line should be standardized. That,26
NA,is a matter which is sufficiently close to,26
NA,the matter in issue before the court to,26
NA,possibly weigh with the court in reaching,26
NA,a decision whether there should be,26
NA,standardization of this section by the Com-,26
NA,monwealth. It is for that reason th.it such,26
NA,"matters are treated as being sub judice, and",26
NA,are not discussed in this House.,26
NA,"Mr Forbes -O n the point of order,",26
NA,"the Mr Deputy Speaker, may I suggest that",26
NA,the quite apart from the malter being sub,26
NA,judice- 1 agree with your ruling in rela-,26
NA,tion to the remarks made by the honorable,26
NA,member for East Sydney-thi s bill relates,26
NA,issue to an agreement between the Common-,26
NA,be wealth and the State of South Australia,26
NA,"with regard to certain railway equipment,",26
NA,not to standardization of the railway line,26
NA,or anything else. I submit that irrespective,26
NA,of the question as to whether the mailer,26
NA,"sub judice, the honorable member is",26
NA,can out of order in referring to standardiza-,26
NA,tion in view of Ihe terms in which the bill,26
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Th e honor-,26
NA,able member for East Sydney may con-,26
NA,"the tinue his remarks, but he must restrict",26
NA,them to ihe terms of the bill before the,26
NA,"dealHouse, which relates to an agreement",26
NA,the Commonwealth and the State,26
NA,of South Australia with respect to certain,26
NA,in breach railway equipment.,26
Mr WARD ,"Ver y well, Mr Deputy",26
NA,Speaker. As you seem determined lo re-,26
NA,"gard your ruling as the correct one, and",26
NA,as you have decided to follow the advice,26
NA,cirof a couple of country solicitors,26
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Order !,26
NA,the The honorable gentleman will not reflect,26
NA,"of on a ruling of the Chair, as he is now",26
NA,up doing. He will continue and direct his,26
NA,that you remarks to the bill.,26
Mr WARD , I am just about to con-,26
NA,clude. In view of the fact that your ruling,26
NA,agrees with the viewpoint of this couple,26
NA,"of country solicitors-no t practising,",26
NA,largely- I have decided to conclude my,26
NA,remarks by merely repeating that it is quite,26
NA,evident from ihe obstruction that I have,26
NA,now exp;rienced that this Government and,26
NA,its supporters have no desire to proceed,26
NA,this great national work at the speed,26
NA,at which it ought to be undertaken.,26
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Order ! If,27
NA,the honorable member persists in taking,27
NA,"that line, I shall be forced to take action.",27
NA,He is completely ignoring the ruling that,27
NA,has been given by the Chair. I insist that,27
NA,the honorable member shall not continue to,27
NA,refer to that subject in that manner.,27
Mr WARD ," Mr Deputy Speaker, if",27
NA,you had only retained your patience a,27
NA,"little longer, you would have discovered",27
NA,that you have taken more time than I mythe,27
NA,self intended to take. As I am not perabout it.,27
NA,mitted to discuss this very important ques-,27
NA,"tion any further, I merely want to advise",27
NA,the House that the Opposition is not opposSpeaker.,27
NA,ing this measure.,27
Mr WILSON ,Sturt) [12.3],27
NA,express my appreciation and the appreciation,27
NA,"of my South Australian Liberal colleagues,",27
NA,to the Prime Minister ( Mr Menzies) for,27
NA,having acceded to our request that this,27
NA,"advance of £1,325,000 should be made availwhat",27
NA,able to South Australia to enable it to,27
NA,chase twelve diesel-electric locomotives,27
NA,"also other equipment, as provided in the",27
NA,agreement. The provision of this equipment,27
NA,"will save almost £500,000 a year. As a",27
NA,"business proposition, it is extraordinarily",27
NA,"good. In other words, the saving in between",27
NA,two and three years should completely pay,27
NA,for the equipment. [Quorum formed.],27
NA,It seems deplorable that members of the,27
NA,Labour Party are so lacking in a sense of,27
NA,duty as not to attend in the House. At,27
NA,present time there are only five Opposition,27
NA,members in the chamber. Perhaps later,27
NA,the day we might see a few more of them.,27
NA,"Before I was interrupted, I had said that",27
NA,"the provision of this amount of £1,325,000",27
NA,will enable a saving in running costs of,27
NA,"almost £500,000 a year, and within three",27
NA,years those savings should completely meet,27
NA,the capital cost of the provision of these,27
NA,"locomotives and other equipment. The together,",27
NA,"agreement provides that 70 per cent, of the",27
NA,"cost will be borne by the Commonwealth,",27
NA,"and 30 per cent, will be loaned by the",27
NA,monwealth to the State to be repaid over,27
NA,period of 50 years. The great advantage,27
NA,"this scheme is that the new equipment, while",27
NA,"being provided, will be so designed as to",27
NA,readily convertible to standard-gauge,27
NA,way equipment at very little additional cost.,27
NA,The South Australian Government has,27
NA,"agreed to pay the cost of this conversion, as",27
NA,soon as the line between Port Pirie and,27
NA,Broken Hill is standardized.,27
NA,It was interesting to hear the honorable,27
NA,member for East Sydney ( Mr Ward) criti-,27
NA,cize the Government in relation to rail,27
NA,"standardization. After all, Labour was in",27
NA,"power for eight years, but did not provide",27
NA,1 inch of standard-gauge railway. Four of,27
NA,"those years were post-war years, but all that",27
NA,Labour Government ever did was to talk,27
NA,"Mr Ward - I rise to order, Mr Deputy",27
NA,Is the honorable member entitled,27
NA,to discuss the general standardization scheme,27
NA,or must he confine his remarks to the bill,27
NA,- I desire to before the House?,27
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Order ! He,27
NA,will confine his remarks to the bill before,27
NA,the House. I am listening most intently to,27
NA,the honorable gentleman is saying. He,27
NA,purhas not transgressed to anything like the,27
NA,and extent to which the honorable member for,27
NA,East Sydney transgressed. Immediately he,27
NA,"does transgress, I shall call him to order.",27
NA,"Mr Ward -O n the point of order, Mr.",27
NA,Deputy Speaker: You yourself said that he,27
NA,has not transgressed to the same degree as,27
NA,that to which I transgressed. That is an,27
NA,admission that he is transgressing. I ask,27
NA,you to uphold the Standing Orders.,27
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Th e honor-,27
NA,the able member for East Sydney may rest,27
NA,assured that I shall do so. The honorable,27
NA,in member for Sturt will continue.,27
Mr WILSON ,Th e 900 horse-power,27
NA,diesel electric engines which are to be pro-,27
NA,vided under this agreement are the biggest,27
NA,that can be carried upon the present 60-lb.,27
NA,rails. When the line is converted to,27
NA,"standard gauge, the same engines, when con-",27
NA,"verted, can be used and, by coupling two",27
NA,they will be able to carry the larger,27
NA,loads that were referred to by the honorable,27
NA,member for East Sydney. One would have,27
NA,"Comthought that, having been the Minister",27
NA,a responsible for rail transport in a Labour,27
NA,"of Government, the honorable member for",27
NA,East Sydney would know something of the,27
NA,be technical side. He should know that it is a,27
NA,railpractical proposition to convert these,27
NA,"engines to standard gauge, that the cost will",27
NA,"be very slight, and that they will be able to",28
NA,carry the additional loads by the simple,28
NA,process of coupling two of them together.,28
NA,I express again my appreciation to the,28
NA,Prime Minister and to the Commonwealth,28
NA,Government for having so readily seen,28
NA,merits of this proposition and for having,28
NA,made the advance available so as to enable,28
NA,this stage of improved rail transport,28
NA,introduced without delay.,28
Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,Hindmarsh) only,28
NA,"[12.11] - Mr Deputy Speaker, I have",28
NA,listened to the remarks of the honorable,28
NA,member for Sturt ( Mr Wilson) and I am,28
NA,amazed that he is able to find arguments,28
NA,justify the attitude of the Playford Gotioning,28
NA,vernment in waiting for all these years,28
NA,before making even the slightest move,28
NA,towards bringing the railways of South.,28
NA,tralia into line with what everybody who,28
NA,an authority on railways has been advocating,28
NA,for so many years. For this Government,28
NA,now to go to the expense of buying rollingquarter,28
NA,"stock of 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, when the ultimate",28
NA,intention is to construct a 4-ft. 84-in.,28
NA,"railway system, is to me absolutely absurd.",28
NA,The very first thing which ought to be,28
NA,is for the Playford Government to be told,28
NA,"in no uncertain manner that it, and not the",28
NA,"Commonwealth Parliament, is primarily he",28
NA,responsible for the shocking condition of of,28
NA,the South Australian railway system.,28
NA,It is years and years now since the Labour,28
NA,Party pointed out to the Playford Governto,28
NA,"ment that, unless it did something to face",28
NA,up to its responsibilities instead of blaming,28
NA,trie Commonwealth Parliament for its,28
NA,"alleged failure to give assistance, South",28
NA,tralia would find itself completely isolated,28
NA,from the rest of the Commonwealth and,28
NA,from the rest of Australia's manufacturing,28
NA,and commercial interests. But the South does at the moment.,28
NA,Australian Government did absolutely noth-,28
NA,ing at all for years and years. Not a thing,28
NA,did the Playford Government do in respect,28
NA,"of its railway system, until about two years",28
NA,"ago, when it was at least twelve years too",28
NA,late.,28
NA,Mr Forbes -Wha t about the south-east,28
NA,line?,28
Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,"Th e honorSpeaker,",28
NA,"able member asks, "" What about the southGovernment",28
NA,"east line? "" It is true that many years ago,",28
NA,but long before 1949,28
NA,Mr Forbes -I t was finished last year.,28
Mr CLYDE CAMERON , I am obliged,28
NA,for the interjection. The honorable mem-,28
NA,ber says the line wasfinishedlast year. The,28
NA,the House will have some idea of how long,28
NA,the Playford Government takes to do any-,28
NA,"thing, even when it does start, because it",28
NA,started the south-east line more than ten,28
NA,to be years ago. The honorable member now,28
NA,admits that this paltry little raihvay line,28
NA,from Bordertown to Mount Gambier has,28
NA,just been completed. Is it any wonder,28
NA,that the Commonwealth Government has,28
NA,given the Playford Government away? Is,28
NA,it any wonder that the people controlling,28
NA,to thefinancesof the Commonwealth are ques-,28
NA,the advisability even of giving the,28
NA,money provided for in this bill for the,28
NA,railway system of .South Australia? The,28
NA,Ausplain fact is lhat had the Playford Go-,28
NA,is vernment tackled the problem of moderniz-,28
NA,"ing its railway system away back in 1949,",28
NA,it could have got the job done for one-,28
NA,of what it will now cost and. on,28
NA,"top of that, 75 per cent, of the cost would",28
NA,gauge not a thing was done. Tom Playford just,28
NA,have been met by the Commonwealth. But,28
NA,done allowed the thing to roll on. I am glad,28
NA,that the honorable member for Barker ( Mr.,28
NA,Forbes) is listening to what 1 say. I know,28
NA,does not like me to criticize the Premier,28
NA,South Australia. I know that the,28
NA,Premier of South Australia is to the honor-,28
NA,able member for Barker almost an idol-,28
NA,"some one he has put on a pedestal and who,",28
NA,him cannot do anything wrong. He is,28
NA,"a kind of political pope, who is completely",28
NA,infallible. But when the honorable mem-,28
NA,ber examines this matter he will not look,28
NA,Ausso savage. When he realizes how badly,28
NA,the Premier of South Australia has let his,28
NA,State down the honorable member will not,28
NA,look so savage and so terribly upset as he,28
NA,Those are the plain facts of the position.,28
NA,I regret that the proceedings in the House,28
NA,are not being televized so that everybody in,28
NA,South Australia could see the expression of,28
NA,mock indignation that the honorable mem-,28
NA,ber for Barker puts on when anybody,28
NA,attacks his idol. Sir Thomas Playford. I,28
NA,"think I have said enough, Mr Deputy",28
NA,to convince you that the Playford,28
NA,"is a hopeless, hapless lot of",28
NA,"bunglers, and that as long as we have the",28
NA,"Playford Government there, there is",28
NA,' absolutely no hope of bringing the South,29
NA,Ausiralian railway system into line. The,29
NA,Playford Government is remarkable for the,29
NA,capacity it has for what are known as,29
NA,portable public undertakings.,29
NA,"Mr Opperman -O n a point of order,",29
NA,Mr Deputy Speaker: The bill is fairly,29
NA,"narrowly confined, and I do not wish to",29
NA,"restrict discussion, but I think the honor-",29
NA,able member for Hindmarsh has completely,29
NA,gone off the rails. I call your attention to,29
NA,this phase of his speech.,29
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Th e honor-,29
NA,able member for Hindmarsh will continue.,29
Mr CLYDE CAMERON ," I am pleased,",29
NA,"Sir, that you have allowed me to go so far",29
NA,as this and 1 think tbe reason for the,29
NA,"leniency, which 1 appreciate, and which is",29
NA,quite in order,29
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Order ! The,29
NA,honorable member must now confine his,29
NA,remarks lo the bill.,29
Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,Th e reason,29
NA,is that 1 am attacking the Playford Govern-,29
NA,ment instead of the Commonwealth Govern-,29
NA,ment and am shifting the blame to where,29
NA,it properly lies. I am pleased thai some,29
NA,belated effort is now being made by the,29
NA,Playford Government to do something for,29
NA,the railway system of South Australia. I,29
NA,"regret, however, that the Playford Govern-",29
NA,ment is trying to shift the blame on to,29
NA,"somebody else, as it always does.",29
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Order ! The,29
NA,honorable member must now restrict bis,29
NA,remarks to the bill. He has had a lot of,29
NA,latitude.,29
Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,An d I appre-,29
NA,"ciate it, Sir, because it has given me an",29
NA,opportunity to say a lot of things which,29
NA,perhaps normally I would not have been,29
NA,able to say. But when we return in the next,29
NA,Parliament and there is a new government,29
NA,here and the railway standardization litiga-,29
NA,"tion is completed, I will have some very",29
NA,revealing things to say about Sir Thomas,29
NA,"Playford and some of his henchmen who,",29
NA,"whenever his name is mentioned here, look",29
NA,so terribly indignant and up.et.,29
Mr WENTWORTH ,Mackellar) [12.18].,29
NA,"- I support this bill, particularly in the",29
NA,of the remarks which the Prime Minister,29
NA,( Mr Menzies) made on its introduction.,29
NA,"It is, as he said, an interim measure only,",29
NA,which is meant to lead up to the eventual,29
NA,standardization of the line. I will not dis-,29
NA,cuss the details of that standardization. I,29
NA,think the Government has shown clearly its,29
NA,attitude to standardization. It has done,29
NA,more for the standardization of rail gauges,29
NA,than any previous government did. We can,29
NA,leave it at lhat. I am confident that the,29
NA,provision of these locomotives will not in,29
NA,any way impede or delay the completion of,29
NA,the standardization of this line. It is not,29
NA,"a put-off job but, as the Prime Minister said,",29
NA,this is an interim measure.,29
NA,I direct the attention of the House to some,29
NA,figures that were used by the Prime Minister,29
NA,and which provide a full justification for,29
NA,bringing this bill down in its present form.,29
NA,"As honorable members know, the cost of the",29
NA,locomotives involved under this legislation,29
NA,"will be roughly £1,300,000. The Prime",29
NA,Minister has told us that the estimated,29
NA,saving will be no less than £483.000 a year.,29
NA,This means that the annual savings will be,29
NA,"36 per cent, of the capital cost. In other",29
NA,"words, the investment is earning 36 per cent,",29
NA,for us from the moment we undertake it.,29
NA,No country is rich enough to be able to turn,29
NA,down an investment which gives a return of,29
NA,"36 per cent, in the form of efficient transport",29
NA,and in the form of actual government,29
NA,revenue.,29
NA,This proposal stands on its own feet as a,29
NA,thoroughly economic and worthwhile one.,29
NA,If the full standardization of the line is to,29
NA,be delayed-an d no one regrets more than,29
NA,I do that it should be delayed in any way,29
NA,at all-becaus e finance is not available or,29
NA,because there is a case pending before the,29
NA,"courts or for some other reason, then let us",29
NA,"do the sensible and practical thing, as this",29
NA,"Government is doing, and get the loco-",29
NA,motives on the line while other points are,29
NA,"being argued out. As I have said, no country",29
NA,is rich enough to be able to turn down an,29
NA,"investment which will show a 36 per cent,",29
NA,return.,29
NA,Now let me refer to one other matter. I,29
NA,do not believe that the advantages of com-,29
NA,plete dieselization are confined to one State,29
NA,or to one line. I believe that money spent,29
NA,on the complete dieselization of our railway,29
NA,light systems throughout Australia would give a,29
NA,"very considerable return, if not as much as",30
NA,"the 36 per cent, return that we will get from",30
NA,the investment we are now considering. In,30
NA,"other words, I believe that the case for",30
NA,spending more money now in getting rid of,30
NA,our remaining obsolete steam system is an,30
NA,overwhelming one. As honorable members,30
NA,"will recall, I put detailed figures and esti-",30
NA,mates of the cost of this work before the,30
NA,House on a previous occasion. I do not,30
NA,"propose to repeat them now. I say, how-",30
NA,"ever, as I have said before, that it would",30
NA,be a good thing if the Commonwealth should,30
NA,establish some kind of special revolving fund,30
NA,for the purpose of accelerating the,30
NA,modernization of locomotives throughout,30
NA,"our Australian railway systems. In passing,",30
NA,let me say that I am somewhat inclined to,30
NA,the view that on lines that carry heavy,30
NA,traffic-an d there are not many of them in,30
NA,Australia,30
NA,"Mr Ward -O n a point of order, Mr.",30
NA,Speaker: I would like to know whether the,30
NA,honorable member is in order in discussing,30
NA,the general question of dieselization and,30
NA,standardization in a debate which one of,30
NA,your deputies has already ruled must be,30
NA,restricted to the particular proposal before,30
NA,"us, which provides for expenditure on the",30
NA,provision of diesel electric locomotives and,30
NA,some extra ore trucks on this section of,30
NA,the South Australian railways.,30
Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. John MCLeay) -,30
NA,Order! I think the position is quite clear.,30
NA,The measure before us involves an agree-,30
NA,ment between the South Australian Go-,30
NA,vernment and the Commonwealth Govern-,30
NA,"ment. It deals with rolling-stock, and any",30
NA,reference to rolling-stock would be in,30
NA,"order, although any comments on other",30
NA,matters outside the measure before the,30
NA,House would be out of order.,30
Mr WENTWORTH , I just want to,30
NA,make passing reference to the possible,30
NA,application elsewhere of the principles,30
NA,relating to rolling-stock that are set out in,30
NA,this bill. [Quorum formed.] I was saying,30
NA,"that on lines carrying heavy traffic, of which",30
NA,"there are only a few in Australia, 1 feel that",30
NA,full electrification rather than dieselization,30
NA,"may be the solution. However, considering",30
NA,"Australian railways as a whole, dieselization",30
NA,"is the interim solution, and the principles",30
NA,embodied in this bill might well be given,30
NA,wider application throughout the Australian,30
NA,railway systems.,30
NA,It has been said that the later diesels used,30
NA,on the line will not have the same rate,30
NA,"of utilization as the earlier ones, and that",30
NA,"they cannot, therefore, be expected to earn",30
NA,"the same returns. This, I think, is a",30
NA,"fallacious argument, because in order to",30
NA,get full operating efficiency and economy,30
NA,we must get rid of all the extraneous,30
NA,"apparatus associated with steam traction,",30
NA,and we should do this one line at a time.,30
NA,Full returns are obtained not merely by,30
NA,putting on a few diesels and making full,30
NA,use of them. They are obtained by taking,30
NA,one line at a time and ensuring that only,30
NA,diesels or electric locomotives run on that,30
NA,line. This is a proposition that the various,30
NA,State railway authorities should bear in,30
NA,mind.,30
NA,"If we are to ensure efficient transport,",30
NA,"and if we are to reduce freight rates, which,",30
NA,"I believe, is most important, we should",30
NA,carefully consider our systems of traction,30
NA,on the railways. The steam engine i out r,30
NA,of date. It must be replaced either by,30
NA,diesel locomotives or by full electric trac-,30
NA,tion. If the Government were to establish,30
NA,some kind of special fund on which the,30
NA,States could draw for the accelerated con-,30
NA,version of their railway systems,30
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! I think the,30
NA,honorable member is getting away from the,30
NA,measure before the House.,30
Mr WENTWORTH ,"I f this were done,",30
NA,"Sir, I think it would be an extension of the",30
NA,"principles of this bill into a wider field, and",30
NA,a fully justified extension. I support the,30
NA,"bill, Sir. I express the hope-indeed , the",30
NA,confident hope-tha t the delay in fully,30
NA,standardizing the line will not be a long,30
NA,delay. The Prime Minister has referred,30
NA,to this,30
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! The honorable,30
NA,member is now departing from the measure,30
NA,before the Chair.,30
Mr WENTWORTH ,Th e Prime Minis-,30
NA,ter has referred to this as an interim,30
NA,measure. 1 hope the interval will not be,30
NA,a long one. I fully support the bill.,30
Mr KELLY ,Wakefield) [12.30] - Mr .,30
NA,"Speaker, as most of the railway for which",30
NA,the equipment to be provided under the,30
NA,terms of the agreement with which this bill,31
NA,"is concerned runs through my electorate,",31
NA,I naturally welcome the measure. I,31
NA,"tulate the Government on introducing it, and",31
NA,"I support it wholeheartedly. However, I",31
NA,should like to go a good deal further,31
NA,that and argue the general case for the,31
NA,standardization of rail gauges.,31
Mr SPEAKER ,Th e honorable memsecond-reading,31
NA,ber would not be in order if he were,31
NA,do that.,31
Mr KELLY ," I gather, Sir, that we are",31
NA,not allowed to discuss the rails on which the,31
NA,"rolling-slock will run. For that reason, I",31
NA,feel that I can do no more than say that,31
NA,I hope that the long delayed event which,31
NA,the honorable member for Mackellar ( Mr.,31
NA,Wentworth) has mentioned,31
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! The honorable,31
NA,member ought to get back to the measure,31
NA,before the Chair. The subject of the agree-,31
NA,ment with which it is concerned is rolling-,31
NA,stock.,31
Mr KELLY ,An d not the rails!,31
Mr SPEAKER ,Th e honorable member,31
NA,may on no account discuss anything that,31
NA,is outside the scope of the bill.,31
Mr KELLY ," I bow to your ruling, Sir,",31
NA,and content myself by saying in conclusion,31
NA,that 1 have very much pleasure in support-,31
NA,ing the bill.,31
Mr DUTHIE ,Wilmot) [12.31] - Mr .,31
NA,"Speaker, in one sense you are certainly keepthat",31
NA,ing us on the rails in our discussion,31
NA,measure. We on this side of the House,31
NA,"support the bill, of course, but we are",31
NA,amazed that it has been delayed for so,31
NA,Twelve years after Labour went out of,31
NA,"office, the present Government brings in this",31
NA,measure on the eve of an election.,31
NA,Mr Forbes -I s the honorable member,31
NA,blaming the Commonwealth Government,31
NA,for the delay?,31
Mr DUTHIE ,No t necessarily. There,31
NA,has been a lot of procrastination on the,31
NA,of both the Commonwealth Government,31
NA,and the South Australian Government. The,31
NA,"greatest weakness in the whole proposal, of",31
NA,"course, is that the rolling-stock to be proprovision",31
NA,vided under the terms of the agreement is,31
NA,"be constructed to 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, but will",31
NA,be designed to be readily convertible later to,31
NA,congrathe standard gauge of 4 ft. 81 in.,31
NA,Mr Buchanan -Whic h bill is the honor-,31
NA,than able member discussing?,31
Mr DUTHIE ," I am on the right track,",31
NA,because 1 am taking these details from the,31
NA,speech made by the Prime,31
NA,to Minister ( Mr Menzies). He said-,31
NA,These locomotives and wagons will be con-,31
NA,"structed lo 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, but they will be",31
NA,designed and constructed in such a way as to be,31
NA,readily convertible later lo the standard gauge of,31
NA,"4 ft. 84 in., when the conversion lo standard gauge",31
NA,of the permanent way on the Port Pirie-Broken,31
NA,Hill line is carried out.,31
NA,I consider lhat the construction of wagons,31
NA,and diesel locomotives which may be,31
NA,converted later will be a major engineering,31
NA,feat.,31
NA,The Prime Minister stated also-,31
NA,"Towards the end of last year, the Premier of",31
NA,"South Australia suggested that, as an interim",31
NA,"measure, pending standardization of the Port Pirie-",31
NA,"Broken Hill railway, the cost of certain new 3-ft.",31
NA,6-in. gauge rolling-stock which the Slate desired to,31
NA,provide for the carriage of concentrates from,31
NA,Broken Hill to Port Pirie might be financed under,31
NA,Ihe provisions of Ihe 1949 Railway Standardization,31
NA,Agreement between the Commonwealth and South,31
NA,Australia.,31
NA,The Labour Government provided for the,31
NA,"standardization of this railway and, obvi-",31
NA,"ously, there was no way out without",31
NA,referring back to the agreement between,31
NA,South Australia and the Labour Govern-,31
NA,ment. South Australia was the only State,31
NA,co-operated in the early days of railway,31
NA,of this' standardization.,31
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! The honorable,31
NA,long. member is getting away from the bill.,31
Mr DUTHIE ,"A s a result, this Govern-",31
NA,"ment has finally decided, on the advice of",31
NA,"its officers, lhat it will provide twelve diesel-",31
NA,"electric locomotives, each of approximately",31
NA,"900 horse-power, and 100 ore wagons, each",31
NA,of about 55 tons capacity as standard-gauge,31
NA,"vehicles, but of somewhat lower capacity",31
NA,while opcraled on the narrow-gauge line.,31
NA,part This rolling-stock is estimated to cost,31
NA,"£1,325,000. As the honorable member for",31
NA,"Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) has said, we are",31
NA,"seeing the end of steam locomotives, and the",31
NA,of diesel-eleclric locomotives under,31
NA,to the terms of this agreement represent a,31
NA,"further blow at our coal industry, which is",32
NA,being increasingly affected by the use of,32
NA,diesel power on our railway system. We,32
NA,must realize that diesel locomotives are,32
NA,replacing steam locomotives throughout the,32
NA,"world. I found, during my last visit to the",32
NA,"United States of America, that diesel loco-",32
NA,motives had almost completely replaced,32
NA,steam engines throughout Canada and the,32
NA,United States of America. So the decision,32
NA,to use diesel-electric locomotives is virtually,32
NA,inevitable.,32
NA,We on this side of the House say that,32
NA,the horse-power of the engines to be prolocomotives,32
NA,vided is too low. We consider that they,32
NA,"should be of 2,000 horse-power at least,",32
NA,Mr Speaker. Three of the new dieselprised,32
NA,electric engines will be needed to haul,32
NA,reasonably well loaded train. I cannot,32
NA,"the economics of that. In this respect,",32
NA,"error in judgment has been made, because my question.",32
NA,the new engines will have too little horse-,32
NA,power for the job that they have to do.,32
NA,understand that the weight of each,32
NA,carrying ore from Broken Hill to Port Pirie,32
NA,is many thousands of tons. The honorable,32
NA,"member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly), through",32
NA,"whose electorate the railway runs, could per-",32
NA,"haps tell me, through you, Sir, the weight",32
NA,of the trains.,32
NA,"Mr Kelly -Ther e are 850,000",32
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! The honorable,32
NA,member is out of order.,32
Mr DUTHIE , I am very sorry that,32
NA,honorable member is not allowed to give me,32
NA,the full information.,32
NA,The Prime Minister said further-,32
NA,The provision of this rolling-stock would,32
NA,the State to obtain immediately substantial savings,32
NA,in operating costs through the introduction,32
NA,diesel traction on the railway.,32
NA,That is reasonable enough. He continued-,32
NA,The railway is at present carrying approxi-,32
NA,"mately 800,000 tons of concentrates per annum,",32
NA,"in addition to general traffic, and an estimate",32
NA,supplied by the Premier indicated that,32
NA,"tional savings of about £483,000 a year could",32
NA,achieved with the use of the new modern,32
NA,stock.,32
NA,"From an economic stand-point, that is",32
NA,sensible. The saving of so much annually,32
NA,would be of great advantage to South vides as follows:-,32
NA,Australia.,32
NA,"I want to ask another question, Mr.",32
NA,Speaker. Where will the diesel locoequal,32
NA,motives and the wagons be built? Will they,32
NA,be constructed in South Australia?,32
NA,Mr Ward -O r in Japan?,32
Mr DUTHIE ,"O r in Japan, or in some",32
NA,other part of the world? The Prime Minis-,32
NA,ter said nothing about where the rolling-,32
NA,stock is to be built.,32
NA,Mr Reynolds -W e shall make that,32
NA,decision.,32
Mr DUTHIE , I think it is a very,32
NA,"important decision, too. Where are the",32
NA,and wagons to be constructed?,32
NA,The Prime Minister has been completely,32
NA,silent on the matter. I am very much sur-,32
NA,at the silence of the Minister for,32
NA,"each Shipping and Transport ( Mr Opperman),",32
NA,see who is now at the table. I hope that he,32
NA,an will take part in the debate and answer,32
NA,Mr Malcolm Fraser -Th e honorable,32
NA,"1 member is making, not a speech, but a",32
NA,"train silly, rambling discourse.",32
Mr DUTHIE ,Th e honorable mem-,32
NA,ber's interjection shows how silly he is.,32
NA,The Prime Minister went on to say-,32
NA,. . . the Commonwealth was impressed by,32
NA,the economies which could be achieved by the,32
NA,provision of more modern rolling-stock.,32
NA,He did not say how long the construction,32
NA,"of the rolling-stock will take, Mr Speaker.",32
NA,I have read very carefully the agreement,32
NA,"which is the schedule to this bill, and f",32
NA,the can find no mention of the time when,32
NA,all these proposals are to be put into effect.,32
NA,"The whole proposal is just an airy-fairy,",32
NA,vaporous one. The agreement between the,32
NA,State Government and the Commonwealth,32
NA,"enable Government may have been signed, but",32
NA,of when will it be put into effect? How long,32
NA,are we to wait before the twelve diesel-,32
NA,electric locomotives and the 100 ore wagons,32
NA,are constructed? The starting date is,32
NA,"important, because this is a major project",32
NA,which will probably take a year or so to,32
NA,operacomplete. That makes us realize more and,32
NA,be more that this is an election tie-up between,32
NA,rollingthe Commonwealth and the State. The,32
NA,more one reads the schedule to the bill the,32
NA,more one realizes the real nature of the,32
NA,set-up. Clause 6 of the agreement pro-,32
NA,(1.) The State shall from its Consolidated,32
NA,Revenue pay to the Commonwealth an amount,32
NA,to three-tenths of the payments made by the,32
NA,Commonwealth to the State in each financial year,33
NA,under clause 5 of this agreement by fifty equal,33
NA,annual contributions commencing on the thirtieth,33
NA,day of June next following the end of that financial,33
NA,"year, together with interest on so much of that",33
NA,amount as has not been paid at the beginning of,33
NA,the financial year in which the contribution is,33
NA,calculated from the beginning of that financial,33
NA,year.,33
NA,That is about as clear as the Government's,33
NA,economic policy.,33
NA,"Mr Calwell -An d as misleading, too.",33
Mr DUTHIE ,Yes . and probably as mis-,33
NA,leading. If that means that the payments,33
NA,arc to be spread over 50 years,33
NA,is that that is an incredibly long time for a,33
NA,wealthy State like South Australia to be,33
NA,"allowed for the repayment of £1,250,000.",33
NA,Mr Ward -I t sounds like the agreement,33
NA,with Ansett.,33
Mr DUTHIE ,Yes . Clause 6 of the,33
NA,agreement continues-,33
NA,(2.) The rate of interest payable by the State,33
NA,under this clause shall be the rate payable on,33
NA,long term loan last raised by the Commonwealth,33
NA,Australia for public subscription prior to the end Japan.,33
NA,of the financial year in which the payments were,33
NA,made by the Commonwealth.,33
NA,Clause 7 of the agreement reads-,33
NA,The State shall submit to the Minister not later the remarks,33
NA,than the thirtieth day of April in each year an,33
NA,estimate of the payments for which request,33
NA,made to the Commonwealth during the next,33
NA,succeeding financial year.,33
NA,Clause 8 reads-,33
NA,(1.) The State shall furnish to the Minister,33
NA,annually and at such other times as he may,33
NA,a report and financial statement in connexion,33
NA,expenditure by the State on the locomotives,33
NA,wagons to be acquired by the State under this,33
NA,agreement.,33
NA,"Good heavens, you would think that obtainapply",33
NA,ing these locomotives and wagons,33
NA,to take the next ten years. This is another,33
NA,indication of the nebulous nature of the,33
NA,agreement. The State is being given un-,33
NA,limited time to get these wagons and diesels,33
NA,built. There is nothing definite about the,33
NA,agreement. Jt will be many many years,33
NA,before standardization comes if this aspect,33
NA,is going to take so long.,33
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! The honorable,33
NA,member is getting out of order.,33
Mr DUTHIE ,Th e Minister has a lot,33
NA,to tell the Opposition before we shall be,33
NA,satisfied with this strange and nebulous that.,33
NA,measure. Even though we agree with the,33
NA,measure in principle we regard the progress,33
NA,"to be made under it as too slow, and the",33
NA,agreement as too indefinite. It is not stated,33
NA,"when this work is to start, or when the line",33
NA,"due, is to be in operation. The financial arrange-",33
NA,ments also are about as loose and ephemeral,33
NA,as the Government's economic arrangements,33
NA,generally are. For these reasons we accept,33
NA,the bill under protest.,33
NA,Question resolved in the affirmative.,33
NA,"Bill read a second time, and reported from",33
NA,committee without amendment or debate;,33
NA,all I can say report adopted.,33
NA,Third Reading.,33
NA,Motion (by Mr Opperman)-b y leave-,33
NA,proposed-,33
NA,That the bill be now read a third time.,33
Mr CALWELL ,Melbourne-Leade r of,33
NA,the Opposition) [12.45] -Th e Opposition is,33
NA,in a very inquisitive frame of mind. We,33
NA,should like an assurance that the locomotives,33
NA,the to be ordered as the result of this legislation,33
NA,in will be manufactured in Australia and not in,33
Mr OPPERMAN ,Corio - Minister,33
NA,for Shipping and Transport) [12.46] -,33
NA,"in reply- I think that, because of",33
NA,that have been made,33
NA,will be sotto voce by the Leader of the,33
NA,Opposition ( Mr Calwell) based on his,33
NA,assumption that those locomotives and,33
NA,"vehicles will be built in other countries, I",33
NA,should clarify the position to the House.,33
NA,request The money is being made available by the,33
NA,"with Commonwealth to South Australia, and it",33
NA,and wiil be the responsibility of South Australia,33
NA,to let the contracts. Tt will be South Aus-,33
NA,"tralia's money, and South Australia will",33
NA,it in the way that will be in the best,33
NA,was going interests of the State.,33
NA,The honorable member for Wilmot ( Mr.,33
NA,Duthie) mentioned the time of commence-,33
NA,"ment. As he read out himself, immediately",33
NA,the line is in operation there will be a profit,33
NA,of £483.000. Despite what has been,33
NA,said about Sir Thomas Playford by the,33
NA,honorable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr.,33
NA,"Clyde Cameron), I do not think that any-",33
NA,body can say that Sir Thomas has not,33
NA,"shown, right throughout his political career,",33
NA,that he has acute business acumen.,33
NA,Mr Cairns -N o one would argue about,33
Mr OPPERMAN ,Tha t is exactly my,34
NA,"point. He, of all people, will take advan-",34
NA,tage of this money to have the line running,34
NA,profitably without delay.,34

NA,AIRLINES AGREEMENTS BILL 1961. of,34
NA,Second Reading.,34
NA,Debate resumed from 25th October (vide,34
NA,"page 2474), on motion by Mr Townley-",34
NA,That the bill be now read a second time.,34
Mr WHITLAM ,Werriwa) [2.15] -,34
NA,When the Prime Minister ( Mr Menzies),34
NA,answered his first question on the Paltridge,34
NA,"affair, he said he was not an avid but a",34
NA,"selective reader of newspapers. Last night,",34
NA,the right honorable gentleman showed,34
NA,self not an avid but a selective reader,34
NA,correspondence. He confined himself to,34
NA,the initial and concluding pleasantries,34
NA,two letters. I will come back to the correto,34
NA,spondence later. I think at this stage,34
NA,that one needs to say about it is that,34
NA,of the letters to which the Prime Minister,34
NA,"made reference, and which were produced",34
NA,"in another place, was produced by him",34
NA,when the Leader of the Opposition asked,34
NA,for them on Tuesday. He quoted selected,34
NA,letters and selected portions of those letters,34
NA,"last night. He then suggested to us,",34
NA,order that we might belatedly see the shareholders,34
NA,correspondence for which we had asked,34
NA,"day and a half before, that we might seek",34
NA,the adjournment of the debate and examine,34
NA,them. We accepted his offer. We have,34
NA,examined the correspondence. We find,34
NA,one letter from the Minister for Civil Avia-,34
NA,tion (Senator Paltridge). He is unquesJune last year,34
NA,"tionably a confused and a confusing talker,",34
NA,both face to face and over the telephone.,34
NA,He does not convey at the time the,34
NA,"impression which, eighteen months later,",34
NA,he now for the first time is prodded,34
NA,saying he meant to convey. He is,34
NA,sparing letter-writer; one short letter,34
NA,him occurred in all this correspondence.,34
NA,I will now come to the pith and substance,34
NA,of the Prime Minister's speech last night.,34
NA,The right honorable gentleman dealt with,34
NA,the two allegations which he thought,34
NA,made against his Minister for Civil Aviathink,34
NA,tion. The first charge was that the Minister,34
NA,had sought to persuade or to order East-,34
NA,West Airlines Limited to accept a take-,34
NA,over offer made by Mr Reg Ansett or,34
NA,his company. The other allegation-whic h,34
NA,he created in order to dispose of it-wa s,34
NA,that the Minister for Civil Aviation was,34
NA,doing his best to ruin East-West Airlines.,34
NA,"Now, the Prime Minister in his argu-",34
NA,ment on the first charge stuck to his answer,34
NA,Tuesday of this week and to his Minis-,34
NA,ter's answer given on Tuesday of last week.,34
NA,He stressed the fact that an offer was made,34
NA,by Mr Ansett to East-West Airlines in,34
NA,May of last year and was refused by East-,34
NA,West Airlines in May of last year. He,34
NA,made great play of the fact,34
Mr BURY ,Ther e had not been an offer.,34
Mr WHITLAM ,Yes ; and you had a,34
NA,letter from Mr Ansett pointing out that,34
NA,himthe offer was still open. You had it in,34
NA,of July this year as we all did. The Prime,34
NA,Minister stressed how futile it would have,34
NA,in been on all his reasoning for the Minister,34
NA,urge the directors of East-West Airlines,34
NA,all to consider an offer which had been re-,34
NA,none fused by East-West Airlines and which,34
NA,was no longer being made by the Ansett,34
NA,company. But the flaw in this argument,34
NA,appears very clearly from the statement by,34
NA,the Minister in another place of which we,34
NA,were given a copy also last night. The,34
NA,Minister pointed out that on 25th June,34
NA,"in last year, an extraordinary meeting of",34
NA,of East-West Airlines,34
NA,a amended the articles so that in future,34
NA,share transfers would require specific,34
NA,approval of the board of the company.,34
NA,"Now, Sir, the deputation which the Minis-",34
NA,ter summoned or agreed to receive in,34
NA,Mr Anderson -H e did not summon it.,34
Mr WHITLAM ,"You r colleague, the",34
NA,honorable member for New England ( Mr.,34
NA,into Drummond) used the word summoned.,34
NA,a I would accept his word as soon as I,34
NA,from would accept the word of any one in this,34
NA,place. I would think that any honorable,34
NA,member in this place confronted with a,34
NA,"statement, on oath or unsworn, by the",34
NA,Minister for Civil Aviation and a statement,34
NA,by the honorable member for New England,34
NA,were would believe the latter. And I would,34
NA,that the crusty tory who represents,34
NA,the electorate of Hume in this place is,34
NA,the only honorable member on the left of,35
"yourself, Mr SPEAKER ","tha t is, the only",35
NA,member in the Country Party or the,35
NA,Labour Party-wh o would not believe the,35
NA,honorable member for New England in,35
NA,preference to the Minister for Civil Avia-,35
NA,tion on this matter.,35
NA,1 come back to the flaw in the Prime,35
NA,Ministers argument concerning the depu-,35
NA,tation to the Minister in July of last year.,35
NA,The Minister has not referred in his several,35
NA,statements to the presence at that deputa-,35
NA,tion of the honorable member for New,35
NA,"England. Throughout, the Minister relies",35
NA,on the silence of his departmental officers.,35
NA,He thought he could rely on the silence,35
NA,"of his colleague, but his colleague was not",35
NA,going to be silenced and sec his constituent,35
NA,and trusty friend- a professional man he,35
NA,knows-traduce d in another place in the,35
NA,way the Minister was doing. The plain,35
NA,fact is that the deputation took place with,35
NA,the acting chairman of directors and other,35
NA,"directors of East-West Airlines, and sub-",35
NA,sequent conversations took place in June,35
NA,of this year at Orange and in July of this,35
NA,year in the Minister's study at Canberra,35
NA,with the chairman of directors of East-West,35
NA,Airlines to persuade the directors to give,35
NA,sanction to the transfer of shares. The,35
NA,whole object and the whole relevance of,35
NA,the conversations with the Minister has,35
NA,been that he would persuade the board to,35
NA,give the necessary consent to the transfer,35
NA,of shares to Mr Ansett's company.,35
NA,"The Prime Minister's braggadocio, blus-",35
NA,"ter, bluff and bullying last night completely",35
NA,avoids the issue. These conversations were,35
NA,to persuade the directors to give the con-,35
NA,"sent which, since June of last year, they",35
NA,have to give before there can be a transfer,35
NA,of shares. This offer by Mr Ansett is,35
NA,"still open. In July of this year, Mr Ansett",35
NA,"wrote to every member of this Parliament,",35
NA,and those who are avid and not merely,35
NA,selective readers of their correspondence,35
NA,will remember this statement in it-,35
NA,Wc have no intention of making any further,35
NA,"approaches, but if the Directors and shareholders",35
NA,of East-West ever see the economies and advan-,35
NA,tages of such an amalgamation or some other,35
NA,form of association and decide to approach my,35
NA,company we would be prepared to study the,35
NA,"position very carefully, with the object of",35
NA,ing a mutually satisfactory arrangement.,35
NA,Every request which Mr Ansett made in,35
NA,that letter to honorable members in July,35
NA,has been brought about by this and the,35
NA,companion bills-ever y one of them. There,35
NA,is only one thing in the bill which he did,35
NA,not ask for and that is the precise amount,35
NA,of the guarantee he required for his loans.,35
NA,So much for the Prime Minister's first point.,35
NA,All these conversations had a very distinct,35
NA,relevance.,35
NA,The other point that the Prime Minister,35
NA,made is that the Minister for Civil Aviation,35
NA,is unlikely to destroy a company for which,35
NA,he has provided by way of subsidies all its,35
NA,profits and for which he had provided by,35
NA,way of re-equipment most of its aircraft.,35
NA,"Of course, that sounds very convincing until",35
NA,one realizes how much more assistance the,35
NA,Minister has given lo Airlines of New,35
NA,"South Wales, a subsidiary of Ansett's. The",35
NA,"subsidy to East-West Airlines is £27.300,",35
NA,but the subsidy to Airlines of New South,35
NA,"Wales is £44,000. The aircraft provided",35
NA,by the Minister for East-West Airlines,35
NA,"amounted to one Friendship, but for Airlines",35
NA,of New South Wales he provided four,35
NA,"Friendships. In September, 1957, the",35
NA,Minister admitted that rural airlines were,35
NA,unable to make profitable returns on DC3,35
NA,"aircraft, which still comprised in numbers",35
NA,ihe main element of the Australian aircraft,35
NA,fleet. He therefore announced-,35
NA,"In the case of feeder services, the Government",35
NA,has decided to extend assistance by way of,35
NA,subsidy to the operators of essential air services,35
NA,in rural areas and also to help selected operators,35
NA,obtain suitable replacement aircraft for the D.C.3.,35
NA,It is quite plain that the selected operator in,35
NA,New South Wales was Mr Ansett and his,35
NA,"company, in Ihe same way as the selected",35
NA,operator in interstate transport has been,35
NA,Mr Ansett's other company.,35
NA,I should think that the Prime Minister's,35
NA,second defence falls to Ihe ground. He,35
NA,made very great play in his selected quota-,35
NA,"tions from two letters of the word "" threat "".",35
NA,"He used the word "" threat "" or "" threatened """,35
NA,"five times. In fact, the word was never",35
NA,used here before the letters to which he,35
NA,referred were written. The word was used,35
NA,"by Mr Shand, the chairman of directors",35
NA,"of East-West Airlines Limited, when refer-",35
NA,ring this week lo the letter received by his,35
NA,company in March of this year notifying,35
NA,achievit that the subsidy would be cancelled from,35
NA,the end of June of this year. He said that,35
NA,"that was a threat, and it could be interpreted",35
NA,only as a ihreat. Of course it was a threat.,35
NA,What difference would it make to Airlines,36
NA,"of New South Wales Proprietary Limited,",36
NA,"whose subsidy was also being cancelled, if it",36
NA,"lost £44,000 a year? That company is part",36
NA,of an empire which this Government had,36
NA,"already guaranteed, subsidized and built up",36
NA,"to an annual turnover of £26,800,000 in",36
NA,"1959-60, and £44,000 is a very small part of",36
NA,that sum. But to East-West Airlines,36
NA,"Limited, the withdrawal of a subsidy of",36
NA,"£27,300 is vital, because it is an independent",36
NA,airline. It and MACRoberUon Miller Air-,36
NA,lines Limited are the only surviving inde-,36
NA,pendent airlines in Australia.,36
NA,Mr Townley -Wha t about Connellan,36
NA,Airways Limited?,36
Mr WHITLAM ,"True , there is also",36
NA,Connellan Airways Limited. I refer now,36
NA,to the correspondence. The only letter,36
NA,from the Minister was written in August,36
NA,this year. Honorable members will rememlowed,36
NA,"ber that he said, concerning the deputation",36
NA,"he received in July of last year, that",36
NA,"Pringle, the acting chairman of East-West",36
NA,Airlines Limited told him he was proposing,36
NA,talks with Ansett-A.N.A. and asked him to,36
NA,"arrange a meeting, which he declined to",36
NA,do. He said that after the Canberra meet-,36
NA,NA,36
NA,is dated 8th August of last year and is in,36
NA,these terms-,36
NA,The purpose of my writing you this personal,36
NA,letter is to inform you that I am taking my,36
NA,Directors for a short holiday to Brampton Island,36
NA,"on Sunday, 21st August, 1960, where we will be",36
NA,remaining for a period of seven days. It has,36
NA,occurred to me that this could provide the ideal,36
NA,opportunity for a friendly talk with Mr Ansett,36
NA,along the lines mentioned in Canberra.,36
NA,It is felt that such a meeting would be the only,36
NA,way in which we could ascertain whether or,36
NA,there is any chance of this Company working out,36
NA,some mutually acceptable agreement with,36
NA,Ansett Group.,36
NA,"I do not know Mr Ansett personally,",36
NA,would therefore be most grateful,36
NA,pass this information on to him at an appropriate,36
NA,time.,36
NA,We have the Minister's statement that at the,36
NA,"time of the deputation in July last year, he",36
NA,declined to arrange a meeting with Mr.,36
NA,"Ansett. But on 8th August of last year, we",36
NA,NA,36
NA,understanding the Minister as to ask him to,36
NA,arrange the meeting. In the light of subse-,36
NA,"quent revelations, this was a very embarrass-",36
NA,ing request. The Minister did not write in,36
NA,answer; he telephoned. Once again he was,36
NA,misunderstood. Why did the Minister not,36
NA,cover himself with a written repudiation of,36
NA,the suggestion that he should pass on this,36
NA,invitation to Mr Ansett? The arrangements,36
NA,NA,36
NA,Canberra were made by telephone. We do,36
NA,"not know, therefore, whether there was a",36
NA,"request, a summons or an acceptance. The",36
NA,Minister did not mention the presence of the,36
NA,honorable member for New England ( Mr.,36
NA,Drummond) until the latter revealed the,36
NA,fact. There has been no note or letter; the,36
NA,only letter written by the Minister was in,36
NA,August this year.,36
Mr BURY ,Wha t evidence is there of,36
NA,this?,36
Mr WHITLAM ,"Ther e was, first, a",36
NA,NA,36
NA,of a denial by the Minister. This was fol-,36
NA,by a statement by the honorable,36
NA,member for New England and then there,36
NA,NA,36
NA,day we have a record made by Captain,36
NA,"Smith, who was in the deputation.",36
NA,Mr Hulme -Whe n was it made?,36
Mr WHITLAM ,"O n 29th July, 1960.",36
NA,The note of that interview is as follows:-,36
NA,The result was:-,36
NA,1. A better understanding of our position,36
NA,in relation to the requirements of the,36
NA,"Government, to know everything that",36
NA,East-West Airlines is planning if it,36
NA,wants its subsidy to continue.,36
NA,2. Definite knowledge that the Minister would,36
NA,like to see East-West Airlines join the,36
NA,Ansett Transport Industries group. It,36
NA,is my opinion lhat he would be in favour,36
NA,of this without caring very much how,36
NA,it was accomplished.,36
NA,not This is a contemporary note of a conversa-,36
NA,the tion between the Minister and other in-,36
NA,terested parties. It is vouched for in this,36
NA,and I place by the honorable member for New,36
NA,if you could England. It continues-,36
NA,"3. The Minister, and to a degree, the",36
NA,"Director-General, were infuriated by the",36
NA,company's approach to the N.S.W. Go-,36
NA,"vernment, with its subsequent promise",36
NA,of support for East-West Airlines and,36
NA,bad publicity for Ansett.,36
NA,4. The Director-General gave a resume of,36
NA,the assistance that the department had,36
NA,"given to East-West Airlines, which, it",36
NA,"would appear, was responsible for almost",36
NA,everything that East-West Airlines has,36
NA,"achieved to date, and effectively punc-",36
NA,tuated his remarks with brief references,36
NA,to the difficulty that the Minister,37
NA,experience in paying a subsidy to a,37
NA,company that did not place its destiny,37
NA,"entirely in his hands, or words to that",37
NA,effect.,37
NA,Mr Hulme -Wa s that a fact?,37
Mr WHITLAM ,Th e Minister made,37
NA,no note at the time. He was not pre-,37
NA,"pared to commit himself to writing, and",37
NA,he has refused to go into the witness-box,37
NA,on this statement.,37
Mr BURY ,Thi s is purely one-sided.,37
Mr WHITLAM ,"O f course, it is one-",37
NA,sided and it is corroborated by the honor-,37
NA,able member for New England.,37
NA,"Mr Hulme -No , he did not say that",37
NA,at all.,37
Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. John MCLeay) -,37
NA,Order! I ask the House to come to order.,37
NA,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will,37
NA,address the Chair.,37
Mr WHITLAM ,Th e note continues-,37
NA,Senator Paltridge was completely honest in his,37
NA,talks,37
NA,Mr Snedden -An d has remained honest,37
NA,at all times.,37
Mr WHITLAM , I think what the note,37
NA,meant was that he had been completely,37
NA,frank.,37
NA,Mr Snedden -An d he has continued to,37
NA,be.,37
Mr WHITLAM ,"No , that is not now the",37
NA,position.,37
NA,Mr Snedden -I t is.,37
Mr WHITLAM ,"O f course, the honor-",37
NA,able member for Bruce has never been,37
NA,known to deviate from his support of any,37
NA,government policy or actions during his,37
NA,presence in this chamber or in this country.,37
NA,Mr Snedden -Tha t is very true.,37
Mr WHITLAM ,H e will cover up any-,37
NA,thing that is done in these matters. The,37
NA,note then goes on-,37
NA,Indeed he was very friendly. Both of these,37
NA,"men, however, would, for various reasons, be pre-",37
NA,pared to see East-West Airlines sacrificed on the,37
NA,altar of rationalization in order to make their two-,37
NA,airline policy work. We must never lose sight of,37
NA,this fact.,37
NA,would That is the only contemporary note made,37
NA,of this deputation. Fresh in our minds is,37
NA,what we heard the honorable member for,37
NA,New England say on it.,37
NA,I have no time to go on to refer to the,37
NA,varied versions made by Mr Shand and by,37
NA,Senator Paltridge on the conversation,37
NA,between them at Orange in June of this year,37
NA,and at Canberra in July of this year. I shall,37
NA,content myself with quoting what was said,37
NA,in the New South Wales Legislative,37
NA,"Assembly a week ago by Mr Davis Hughes,",37
NA,the Country Party member for Armidale.,37
NA,He said-,37
NA,"First, Mr Shand has made a statement in regard",37
NA,to a conversation that he had with Senator,37
NA,Paltridge. I accept completely all that Mr Shand,37
NA,"says. Second, any such conversation was a private",37
NA,conversation in which Senator Paltridge was not,37
NA,speaking with the voice of the Federal Government.,37
NA,"We now know, of course, that he was speak-",37
NA,ing with the double voice of the Federal,37
NA,Government in this matter. Mr Davis,37
NA,Hughes repeated-,37
NA,This issue was a private conversation between,37
NA,"Senator Shane Paltridge and Mr Shand, and I have",37
NA,already said that I accept Mr Shand's version. It,37
NA,was not an expression of opinion on behalf of the,37
NA,Federal Government or any other government.,37
NA,Senator Paltridge was not speaking on behalf of,37
NA,the Government.,37
NA,Mr Davis Hughes continued-,37
NA,I have said that what Mr Shand said is correct.,37
NA,Senator Paltridge would now have us believe,37
NA,that he has always been reluctant to give any,37
NA,"advice on what this company should do, and",37
NA,has always left matters for the commercial,37
NA,judgment of the company's board. Never-,37
NA,"theless, he has been very ready in the other",37
NA,"place, the Prime Minister, presumably on",37
NA,information given to him by the Minister for,37
NA,"Civil Aviation, has been ready in this place,",37
NA,and the Director-General has been very,37
NA,"ready in correspondence, to make many",37
NA,comments on the commercial judgment of,37
NA,this company's board in connexion with the,37
NA,"issue of company shares, the jeopardizing",37
NA,"of its subsidy, its search for new aircraft,",37
NA,"operation of its new air routes, its declara-",37
NA,tion of surpluses and dividends and its,37
NA,refusal to be taken over or to amalgamate.,37
NA,It is quite plain that there is conflict between,37
NA,the parties on this point. I have no hesita-,37
NA,tion in saying whom I believe among those,37
NA,whom I know.,37
NA,The newspapers have referred very clearly,37
NA,"to this matter. For instance, this morning,",37
NA,"the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" tersely",38
NA,says-,38
NA,"The Prime Minister said yesterday: "" I believe",38
NA,Senator Paltridge's statements to be absolutely,38
NA,"true"". Since Senator Paltridge has said one",38
NA,"one day and another the next, it may fairly",38
NA,which of his statements are to be taken as,38
NA,""" absolutely true "".",38
NA,The Minister's attempt to intimidate a small there.,38
NA,private airline into surrendering to a big,38
NA,"competitor assumes, in the words of the",38
NA,""" Sydney Morning Herald "", the proportion",38
NA,of a serious scandal. Even if it were,38
NA,for the divergence of statements on the,38
NA,"Minister's attitude, let us look at his record",38
NA,in connexion with the matter. Right throughopinion,38
NA,"out, the present Minister for Civil Aviation operations",38
NA,has favoured Ansett Transport Industries Ihis,38
NA,Limited in every form of intra-State travel.,38
NA,"In 1958, Butler Air Transport Limited was",38
NA,taken over by Ansett. There had been three implemented.,38
NA,airlines in New South Wales up to lhat time.,38
NA,Ansett took over Butler Air Transport,38
NA,Limited. Trans-Australia Airlines then,38
NA,"thought, "" Let us compete with our comintra-State",38
NA,"petitor within New South Wales "". T.A.A.",38
NA,then applied to the New South Wales Goport,38
NA,vernment for a licence to operate within,38
NA,New South Wales on the routes that had,38
NA,formerly been served by Butler Air TransAirlines,38
NA,"port Limited, which had just been taken",38
NA,over by T.A.A.'s interstate competitor.,38
NA,Minister instructed T.A.A. to withdraw that,38
NA,application.,38
NA,"Also in 1958, this Parliament amended",38
NA,the act to limit the period within which,38
NA,a State parliament could pass legislation,38
NA,giving permission for T.A.A. to operate,38
NA,"within the State. At that time, Tasmania",38
NA,had an act which had not been proclaimed.,38
NA,The Tasmanian Government proclaimed the,38
NA,"act, and thereupon it became legal for",38
NA,Australia Airlines to operate within,38
NA,mania. In the succeeding three and a,38
NA,"years, the Minister has refused permission",38
NA,to T.A.A. to operate within that State.,38
NA,Mr Townley -T.A.A . operates every,38
NA,day in Tasmania.,38
NA,Mr WHfTLAM -Fro m Launceston to within,38
NA,Hobart. Your Minister for Civil Aviation,38
NA,has not looked after your State,38
NA,you did when you were Minister for Civil,38
NA,Aviation. He has refused T.A.A. permis-,38
NA,sion to operate between Wynyard and,38
NA,Smithton or the north coast ports and,38
NA,Hobart. T.A.A. can fly from Melbourne,38
NA,"the north coast of Tasmania but, within",38
NA,Tasmania people must travel along the north,38
NA,coast or go from the north coast to Hobart,38
NA,"either by road or rail, and if they wish to go",38
NA,"thing from one port to another, they must go by",38
NA,be askedeither of those means. The Minister pre-,38
NA,vented intra-State operation by T.A.A.,38
NA,"Thirdly, the Minister has declared lhat it",38
NA,is government policy not to allow T.A.A.,38
NA,to operate intra-State. On 23rd August last,38
NA,"not year, he stated in the other place-",38
NA,. . . Trans-Australia Airlines has always held,38
NA,"the view, and always pressed the view, lhat in its",38
NA,no restraint at all should be placed on its,38
NA,in respect of intra-state services. Mr.,38
NA,MCDonald said-an d I have acknowledged it in,38
NA,chamber on a number of occasions-tha t lhat,38
NA,was the view of the Australian National Airlines,38
NA,"Commission. The Government, however, for policy",38
NA,"reasons, has decided that that view shall not be",38
NA,I come now to the fourth instance of this,38
NA,Minister's preference for Ansett-A.N.A. in,38
NA,operations. The Commonwealth,38
NA,"Government spends £200,000 on air trans-",38
NA,within South Australia to the Woomera,38
NA,Rocket Range. T.A.A. is not allowed to,38
NA,"have the business. The Ansett subsidiary,",38
NA,of South Australia Proprietary,38
NA,"Limited, is given that business. The Com-",38
NA,The monwealth has refused to charter T.A.A.,38
NA,"but it has, in fact, chartered the other com-",38
NA,"panies for cloud seeding, for map making",38
NA,"and for oil surveys. Fifthly, as I have",38
NA,"already pointed out, the Minister has can-",38
NA,celled the subsidies to the two intra-State,38
NA,airlines in New South Wales-th e larger,38
NA,subsidy to the subsidiary of the colossus and,38
NA,the smaller subsidy to the only independent,38
NA,"company still operating there. Sixthly, the",38
NA,Minister has now forbidden T.A.A. to make,38
NA,Transmore Friendships available to East-West,38
NA,TasAirlines Limited. The only Friendship,38
NA,half which East-West Airlines Limited has,38
NA,received under the Minister's policy as,38
NA,stated four years ago was made available,38
NA,by T.A.A. The Minister has now directed,38
NA,"that, pursuant to the New South Wales",38
NA,Government's equalization of air business,38
NA,"the Slate, T.A.A. is not to make any",38
NA,more Friendships available to East-West,38
NA,as well as Airlines Limited.,38
NA,"Now, in the letter which the Prime",38
NA,Minister wrote on Monday of this week 10,38
NA,"Mr Shand, the Government itself has",38
NA,to made two further things plain. The first,38
NA,is that there will be no further Friendships,39
NA,imported into Australia for East-West Air-,39
NA,lines Limited and the second that East-West,39
NA,Airlines Limited will not be able to cross-,39
NA,charter Friendships for DC3's within New,39
NA,South Wales as Ansett was able to cross-,39
NA,charter Viscounts for DC6B's with T.A.A.,39
NA,in interstate transport.,39
NA,I have referred to the definite actions of,39
NA,the Minister. I now refer to the actions,39
NA,"of the co-ordinator who is, of course, the",39
NA,"Director-General of Civil Aviation, and",39
NA,who is required to carry out the Govern-,39
NA,ment's policy. Wherever an application,39
NA,has come before the co-ordinator in con-,39
NA,"nexion with intra-state traffic, he has ob-",39
NA,liged Ansett-A.N.A. Trans-Australia Air-,39
NA,lines asked for permission to land at Wagga,39
NA,and Cooma in the course of interstate,39
NA,"traffic, but the co-ordinator, carrying out",39
NA,"government policy, refused permission to",39
NA,do so. It is clear that in all these matters,39
NA,the Minister is just maintaining the sub-,39
NA,"servient, acquiescent attitude towards Mr.",39
NA,Ansett which he has shown throughout his,39
NA,term of office. When it comes to air,39
NA,"routes, aircraft or further subsidies, he",39
NA,"obliges Mr Ansett in every case. That is,",39
NA,he does not care how much internal air,39
NA,fares increase in Australia. External air,39
NA,fares have not increased comparably. You,39
NA,can travel from London to Australia by air,39
NA,not only three times as fast as after the,39
NA,war but at less cost. But in that time air,39
NA,"fares within Australia have doubled, and",39
NA,they have doubled in order to foster the,39
NA,Government's obligations to Mr Ansett.,39
NA,Only in America is there a private airline,39
NA,"system, and in America the airlines do",39
NA,"not make the 10 per cent, interest which",39
NA,the Government is prepared to guarantee,39
NA,that Mr Ansett will make on his invest-,39
NA,ment. No airline can be as profitable as,39
NA,this. We are guaranteeing Mr Ansett's,39
NA,"take-overs and gambling debts, and we are",39
NA,keeping him afloat in order to keep him,39
NA,flying.,39
NA,In order to allow the Minister and every-,39
NA,body else who has got the courage to do,39
NA,so to swear to the explanations that have,39
NA,"been belatedly made in the last two weeks,",39
NA,I move-,39
NA,"That all words after "" That"" be omitted",39
NA,a view to inserting the following words in place,39
NA,"thereof:- "" this House declines to give a second",39
NA,reading to the bill until such time as the Go-,39
NA,vernment appoints a Royal Commission to inquire,39
NA,into the negotiation and administration by the,39
NA,Minister for Civil Aviation of agreements with,39
NA,"airline operators."".",39
NA,If it suited the Prime Minister politically to,39
NA,"have a royal commission, he would be the",39
NA,first to appoint it. There is no question that,39
NA,he would again re-vamp the Albert Hall be-,39
NA,fore the election in order to have a prelimin-,39
NA,ary hearing. There is no doubt that he would,39
NA,again brief assisting counsel to conceal at the,39
NA,preliminary hearing any embarrassing,39
NA,features of the prospective evidence.,39
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! The honorable,39
NA,member's time has expired. Is the amend-,39
NA,ment seconded?,39
NA,"Mr Calwell - I second it, with great",39
NA,enthusiasm; and I reserve my right to speak.,39
Mr BARNES ,MCPherson) [3.46] - I,39
NA,oppose the amendment. We have been very,39
NA,interested to see quite recently that the,39
NA,Opposition has introduced a fantasy over,39
NA,the airlines position in New South Wales.,39
NA,Last night the Prime Minister ( Mr Menzies),39
NA,shattered that fantasy. To-day the Deputy,39
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) has,39
NA,not shaken the force of the Prime Minister's,39
NA,"speech, but has only attempted to heighten",39
NA,the fantasy. I listened most attentively to,39
NA,"the honorable gentleman, and I cannot see",39
NA,where he has grounds to alter anything what-,39
NA,soever that the Prime Minister said last,39
NA,"night. Of course, the honorable gentleman",39
NA,has some advantages. If we read this morn-,39
NA,"ing's press, we see that the Sydney ""Daily",39
NA,"Telegraph"" gives a very clear and fair",39
NA,statement of the proceedings in the House,39
NA,"last night. If we read the "" Sydney Morning",39
NA,"Herald "", we can see just where it stands. It",39
NA,is using this fantastic suggestion of the,39
NA,Opposition to further its criticisms of this,39
NA,Government. This is traditional with the,39
NA,""" Sydney Morning Herald "".",39
NA,I particularly direct attention to the fact,39
NA,that the two letters from which the Prime,39
NA,"Minister quoted last night, which gave most",39
NA,"damning evidence against the Opposition,",39
NA,"were not even printed in the "" Sydney",39
NA,"Morning Herald "". What was most amusing",39
NA,to members on this side was that this news-,39
NA,paper even reported proceedings in our joint,39
NA,"party room, stating that great emotions were",39
NA,with experienced by the Minister for Civil Avia-,39
NA,tion (Senator Paltridge) to the extent that,39
NA,tears ran down his cheeks. If that is the,39
NA,sort of reporting that this newspaper directs,40
NA,"to this subject, we can take the rest of what",40
NA,it prints with a grain of salt.,40
NA,"After all, the Department of Civil",40
NA,tion has a great responsibility to this country I refer-,40
NA,"to see that a safe, cheap and most efficient",40
NA,air service is provided for the whole com-,40
NA,munity. 1 believe-an d I speak with some approval,40
NA,experience of this matter-tha t,40
NA,a civil aviation service second to none in the,40
NA,world. This has not been brought about,40
NA,simply. It has been brought about in the,40
NA,face of all the very difficult factors that Aus-,40
NA,"tralia has to surmount. We have, of course,",40
NA,the overall interstate services operated,40
NA,the two main airlines. Then we have the,40
NA,intra-state services operated by companies,40
NA,"within the States. Obviously, we cannot have",40
NA,cut-throat competition in Australia. We,40
NA,have seen what cut-throat competition has,40
NA,done to air services in America. I do nol,40
NA,like to criticize the services of another,40
NA,"try, which is looked upon as one of the great",40
NA,countries of the world; but its standards,40
NA,safety are particularly low and its airline,40
NA,finances are in a particularly weak position.,40
NA,"Here, we are endeavouring to promote",40
NA,petition on satisfactory grounds. If,40
NA,friends in opposition had remained in power,40
NA,after 1949-Go d help this country if they,40
NA,had-w e Would have had only one airline in,40
NA,"Australia, and that would have reduced our rural",40
NA,airline services to the level of our inefficient,40
NA,State railway services. No one would like,40
NA,to see that. We cannot have satisfactory air minate,40
NA,services in this country without competition. airlines,40
NA,This Government stands for free enterprise,40
NA,and we are endeavouring to keep private,40
NA,airlines competing on fair terms with the,40
NA,"government airline, Trans-Australia Airlines. the",40
NA,I believe that that position has been discuss,40
NA,arrived at.,40
NA,Now we consider the position of the State,40
NA,airlines. East-West Airlines Limited and,40
NA,Airlines of New South Wales Proprietary,40
NA,Limited are the major operators in New,40
NA,"South Wales. It is obvious, I think, that",40
NA,politics have come into the question of,40
NA,these airlines. To me it looks as if some,40
NA,effort has been made- I do not think one,40
NA,has to look too hard-b y the New South,40
NA,Wales Government to embarrass this Go-,40
NA,vernment on the eve of a general election.,40
NA,It could not embarrass this Government on,40
NA,the case that has been put up. The State,40
NA,has re-arranged its air services. Under the,40
NA,terms of Ihe contract by which airlines get,40
NA,"subsidies in New South Wales, these sub-",40
NA,sidies now have to be cancelled or re-,40
NA,Aviaexamined. This is the provision to which,40
NA,"The Company shall not, during the continuance",40
NA,of this agreement without the prior written,40
NA,of the Director-General cither directly,40
NA,Australia has or indirectly engage in-,40
NA,(a) interstate public transport air service opera-,40
NA,lions; or,40
NA,(b) any intra-state regular public transport air,40
NA,service operations additional to those,40
NA,being operated at the date of this,40
NA,agreement.,40
NA,"by Obviously, any change at all breaks that",40
NA,contract. It has been very interesting to,40
NA,listen to the Deputy Leader of the Opposi-,40
NA,"tion. He said that this letter, suggesting",40
NA,withdrawal of subsidy from East-West Air-,40
NA,lines Limited is a threat. A letter of the,40
NA,counDirector-General of Civil Aviation is inter-,40
NA,"esting, because it points out that the position",40
NA,of applies not only to East-West Airlines,40
NA,Limited but also to Airlines of New South,40
NA,"Wales Proprietary Limited. The letter,",40
NA,"comdated 28th March, 1961, and addressed to",40
NA,"our Mr R. M. Ansett, managing director,",40
NA,"Ansett Transport Industries Limited, reads-",40
NA,You will be aware that action has been taken,40
NA,by the New South Wales Government to establish,40
NA,a co-ordinating authority for New South Wales',40
NA,services. As the decisions of this authority,40
NA,may have a vital bearing on the Commonwealth's,40
NA,"subsidy obligations, it has been decided to ter-",40
NA,"as from 30th June, 1961, the subsidy con-",40
NA,tracts of both the New South Wales imra-stale,40
NA,with a view lo re-ncgotialing the contracts,40
NA,in the light of changed circumstances.,40
NA,"This letter, therefore, constitutes the notice pro-",40
NA,vided for in clause 1 of the agreement between,40
NA,Commonwealth and Ansett Transport Indus-,40
NA,tries Limited. My officers will be available lo,40

NA,"Yours faithfully,",40

NA,Director-General of Civil Aviation.,40
NA,That went out to both airlines and how it,40
NA,can be interpreted as a threat to one of,40
NA,"them, I do not know. Obviously the subsidy",40
NA,"has to be re-negotiated. After all, this Go-",40
NA,vernment is responsible for the taxpayers',40
NA,money and we have not only to see lhat,40
NA,"ihe people of Australia get a reliable,",40
NA,"efficient and safe air service, but also that",40
NA,their money is not wasted. ] know it will be,40
NA,suggested that the State Government can,40
NA,do better by re-allocating air routes. It has,41
NA,"the opportunity and the power to do that,",41
NA,"but, after all, the present services were",41

NA,Civil Aviation. I f the advice of the State,41
NA,"Government's advisers is to be accepted,",41
NA,that is another matter. It rests completely,41
NA,with the Government of New South Wales.,41
NA,I feel I am unable to go any further in,41
NA,"this matter but I would like to quote, as the",41
NA,"Prime Minister ( Mr Menzies) did, from a",41
NA,letter which shows the attitude of Mr Shand.,41
NA,Is it the letter of a man who is under threat,41
NA,of being pressurized into doing something?,41
NA,"I will read this letter because, unfortunately,",41
NA,the Prime Minister was not on the air last,41
NA,"night when he read it, whereas the Deputy",41
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam),41
NA,has had the advantage of being on the air.,41
NA,Anybody listening to him to-day and,41
NA,"knowing the facts, might get the wrong pressurized?",41
NA,impression. This letter might be interesting,41
NA,also to those people who read only the,41
NA,""" Sydney Morning Herald "". It is dated",41
NA,"12th July, 1961, and it begins, ""Dear",41
NA,"Shane "". Obviously the two are very friendly.",41
NA,The letter proceeds-,41
NA,I have given a lot of thought to the,41
NA,had in Orange.,41
NA,I called at your office when in Canberra last,41
NA,week and found you had departed for South,41
NA,Africa. I hope your trip was as interesting as the,41
NA,one I had there recently.,41
NA,I have been to see Donald Anderson and had,41
NA,a long talk with him.,41
NA,"Could you kindly wire me at your convenience,",41
NA,on your return as I would like to have a talk,41

NA,The letter continues in that friendly strain.,41
NA,"In a letter dated 8th August, 1960, Mr V.",41

NA,occurred to me that this could provide the ideal,41
NA,opportunity for a friendly talk with Mr Ansett,41
NA,along the lines mentioned in Canberra.,41

NA,Mr Bandidt -I s that supposed to have,41
NA,not been written by a man who was being,41
Mr BARNES ,A s the honorable mem-,41
NA,"ber for Wide Bay reminds me, that letter",41
NA,is supposed to have been written by a,41
NA,man who was being threatened. I have,41
NA,not anything further to add except that I,41
NA,feel that the Deputy Leader of the Opposi-,41
NA,talk we tion has made out no case at all.,41
Mr OCONNOR ,Dalley) [3.2] - Mr .,41
NA,"Speaker, the measure before the House con-",41
NA,tinues the extraordinary treatment that the,41
NA,Government has given to Ansett-A.N.A.,41
NA,through the years. There is not the slightest,41
NA,doubt that many people in this country have,41
NA,with rightly come to regard Mr Reg Ansett as,41
NA,the favoured son of this Government.,41
NA,Through this bill the Government proposes,41
NA,to restrict the operations of T.A.A. and to,41
NA,assist the operations of Ansett-A.N.A. When,41
NA,one looks at what has happened to this com-,41
NA,pany and the favoured treatment it has,41
NA,"received down the years, one can understand",41
NA,"our an editorial in the Sydney "" Daily Mirror """,41
NA,"we which said, "" Private enterprise has never",41
NA,"the occasion that had it so good "".",41
NA,In view of all the activities of private,41
NA,enterprise in this country I think it is not,41
NA,"inappropriate to ask why, in this particular",41
NA,industry and in this particular section of,41
NA,"transport, Ansett-A.N.A. is receiving such",41
NA,favoured treatment. Surely no one would,41
NA,countenance for a moment a proposal that,41
NA,for a government should set up a railway,41
NA,"system, erect railway stations and provide",41
NA,"staff, and then let a private company which",42
NA,provided only the rolling-stock operate the,42
NA,services. But that is precisely what is hap-,42
NA,pening here to-day in civil aviation. This,42
NA,Government is using the taxpayers' money in,42
NA,a manner which cannot be defended. It is,42
NA,"doing this, allegedly, in the name of private",42
NA,"enterprise, but all it has achieved up till now",42
NA,has been to assist the growth of Ansett-,42
NA,A.N.A. towards even greater monopoly.,42
NA,"We have heard honorable members, and par-",42
NA,ticularly the honorable member for Mc-,42
NA,Pherson ( Mr Barnes) talking about free,42
NA,"enterprise, but they have had nothing to say",42
NA,"about the fact that Ansett-A.N.A., from the",42
NA,"very inception of its operations, has been",42
NA,taking over smaller competitors. In the,42
NA,last ten years Ansett-A.N.A. has absorbed,42
NA,no less than six private companies in the,42
NA,field of civil aviation. I f members of the,42
NA,Government are so interested in and con-,42
NA,cerned about the preservation of private,42
NA,enterprise and free competition in this coun-,42
NA,"try, what have they to say about the people",42
NA,who have been driven out of this industry,42
NA,as a result of their inability to compete with,42
NA,Ansett-A.N.A.? If it is right for the Govern-,42
NA,ment to give this favorable treatment to one,42
NA,"big private company, why did it not give",42
NA,similar treatment to other companies?,42
NA,I now want to refer to allegations that,42
NA,have been made concerning the Minister for,42
NA,Civil Aviation (Senator Paltridge). At the,42
NA,outset I wish to say that I have absolutely,42
NA,no charges to make against the Minister. I,42
NA,"do believe, however, that a situation has",42
NA,arisen which this Parliament cannot pass by,42
NA,in the manner in which the Prime Minister,42
NA,( Mr Menzies) evidently proposes to pass it,42
NA,by. The Prime Minister has a responsibility,42
NA,to this Parliament as well as to his own,42
NA,party. When this matter was mentioned a,42
NA,"few days ago, reference being made to the",42
NA,allegations of Messrs. Pringle and Shand,42
NA,concerning the Government and the Minis-,42
NA,"ter, the Prime Minister suggested that the",42
NA,whole affair was a kind of a stunt. The,42
NA,following day a member of his own party,42
NA,"supported the allegations, and the Prime",42
NA,Minister did not attempt then to dismiss,42
NA,them as a stunt. He went further and said,42
NA,that the matter had become a political issue,42
NA,"because an election was approaching, and",42
NA,that we of the Opposition were merely ex-,42
NA,ploiting it for political purposes. I say,42
NA,definitely that a case has been made out that,42
NA,warrants the appointment of a royal com-,42
NA,"mission, as proposed in the amendment of",42
NA,the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr.,42
NA,Whitlam).,42
NA,To-day a further witness comes into the,42
NA,picture. An article in this morning's,42
NA,""" Sydney Morning Herald "" reads-",42
NA,"Mr Shand said last night lhat on July 29, 1961,",42
NA,Captain Smith,42
NA,"Captain Smith, I may say, is connected with",42
NA,East-West Airlines-,42
NA,submitted the following record of the meeting:,42
NA,""" The result was:-",42
NA,""" 1. A better understanding of our position in",42
NA,relation to the requirements of the,42
NA,"Government, to know everything that",42
NA,East-West Airlines is planning if it wants,42
NA,its subsidy to continue.,42
NA,""" 2. Definite knowledge that the Minister would",42
NA,like to see East-West Airlines join ihe.,42
NA,Ansett Transport Industries group. It,42
NA,is my opinion that he would be in favour,42
NA,of this without caring very much how,42
NA,ii was accomplished.,42
NA,""" 3. The Minister, and to a degree, the Director-",42
NA,"General, were infuriated by the com-",42
NA,pany's approach to the N.S.W. Govern-,42
NA,"ment, with its subsequent promise of",42
NA,support for East-West Airlines and bad,42
NA,publicity for Ansett.,42
NA,""" 4. The Director-General gave a resume of the",42
NA,assistance that the department had given,42
NA,"to East-West Airlines, which, it would",42
NA,appear was responsible for almost every-,42
NA,thing that East-West Airlines has,42
NA,"achieved to date, and effectively",42
NA,punctuated his remarks with brief,42
NA,references to the difficulty that ihe,42
NA,Minister would experience in paying a,42
NA,subsidy to a company that did not place,42
NA,"its destiny entirely in his hands, or words",42
NA,to that effect.,42
NA,""" Senator Paltridge was completely",42
NA,honest in his talks and does not bear,42
NA,any malice towards East-West Airlines.,42
NA,Indeed he was very friendly. Both of,42
NA,"these men, however, would, for various",42
NA,"reasons, be prepared to see East-West",42
NA,Airlines sacrificed on the altar of,42
NA,rationalisation in order to make their,42
NA,two-airline policy work. We must never,42
NA,"Jose sight of this fact.""",42
NA,The position is lhat two reputable citizens,42
NA,have made allegations against a responsible,42
NA,Minister of this Government. Those allega-,42
NA,"tions have, in effect, been confirmed by a",42
NA,Government supporter in this House.,42
NA,To-day we have a fourth person coming,42
NA,"into the picture, Captain Smith. I say that",42
NA,a prima facie case has been established,42
NA,that calls for an investigation. It is im-,42
NA,quite possible to escape that conclusion. I ask,42
NA,the Government: How serious or how grave,42
NA,must allegations be before the Government,43
NA,will make a move? The Prime Minister and,43
NA,the members of his Government seem to be,43
NA,concerned only with their own personal,43
NA,"prospects, rather than with the well-being",43
NA,and prestige of this Parliament. The posi-,43
NA,tion of the Parliament was well stated by the,43
NA,"late honorable member for Barker, Mr.",43
NA,"Archie Cameron, in 1948, when he was",43
NA,speaking in this House about the appoint-,43
NA,ment of a royal commission to investigate,43
NA,a matter involving a Minister of the Crown.,43
NA,"May I say, incidentally, that the royal com-",43
NA,mission was appointed at the request of the,43
NA,Minister himself at that time. That Minis-,43
NA,ter is now the honorable member for East,43
NA,Sydney ( Mr Ward). The late Mr Cameron,43
NA,said-,43
NA,The time-honoured procedure of democratic,43
NA,"government in British countries is that, as soon as",43
NA,a Minister is called into question in relation to his,43
NA,transactions and his reputation as they touch the,43
NA,"administration of his department, he shall with-",43
NA,draw from the administration of the department,43
NA,until his reputation and his administration have,43
NA,been cleared by competent authorities. Precedents,43
NA,for such a course of action have occurred in this,43
NA,Parliament during my membership of it and during,43
NA,the membership of many other honorable members,43
NA,on both sides of the chamber. A precedent,43
NA,occurred recently in the United Kingdom.,43
NA,To-day's press contains references to the return,43
NA,"to the Attlee Government of Dr Hugh Dalton,",43
NA,who left that Government last year in circum-,43
NA,stances which were not without precedent in the,43
NA,United Kingdom Parliament. Dr Dalton was not,43
NA,charged with any impropriety; he had merely made,43
NA,a slip in regard to the disclosure of some informa-,43
NA,tion contained in the United Kingdom Budget.,43
NA,"On 3rd November, 1938, the then Postapplied",43
NA,"master-General, Senator A. J. MCLachlan, business?",43
NA,after a question concerning his activities had,43
NA,been placed on the notice-paper of the West,43
NA,House of Representatives by the honorable company?,43
NA,"member for Brisbane ( Mr George Lawson),",43
NA,"tendered his resignation, which read, in",43
NA,part-,43
NA,Having regard to the suggestion,43
NA,question that I may in some obscure way have,43
NA,"influenced the department, I feel that one course",43
NA,"only is open to me, and that is to tender my",43
NA,resignation as Postmaster-General. This I do with,43
NA,"some reluctance at such a time, but the protection",43
NA,of my honour and the honour of the,43
NA,against any insinuation that underlies the question,43
NA,on the notice-paper leaves no other course open,43
NA,"to me, and appears to be the one I should adopt",43
NA,under the circumstances.,43
NA,While speaking in the Senate on the day,43
NA,"on which he tendered his resignation,",43
NA,Senator MCLachlan said-,43
NA,My only regret is that the public life of this,43
NA,democracy has sunk so low that it should be for,43
NA,one moment suspected that a man would abuse,43
NA,the trust reposed in him by the Crown. I say that,43
NA,it is a degradation of democracy that such a,43
NA,charge should be made. My personal honour is,43
NA,dearer to me than all the pelf in the world.,43
NA,It is quite obvious that a very strong case,43
NA,has been made out: for government action.,43
NA,The Opposition is not alone in holding this,43
NA,opinion. Reference has been made to,43
NA,reaction throughout the country to these,43
NA,allegations. A n editorial in this morning's,43
NA,""" Sydney Morning Herald "" said-",43
NA,"If, however, as a great many people will prefer",43
NA,"to believe after Mr Drummond's revelations, the",43
NA,Federal Government through the Minister for,43
NA,Civil Aviation tried to intimidate a small private,43
NA,airline into surrendering to a big competitor mani-,43
NA,festly favoured by ths Government in other direc-,43
NA,"tions, then the affair assumes the proportion of a",43
NA,serious scandal. That the Government should,43
NA,intervene at all in such an issue is beyond all,43
NA,propriety. That it should intervene to promote,43
NA,a monopoly and force free-enterprise competition,43
NA,out of existence is the grossest possible betrayal of,43
NA,the principles it is pledged to uphold.,43
NA,"It is quite true, as the speaker who preceded",43
NA,"me in this debate said, that the Sydney",43
NA,""" Daily Telegraph"", in its editorial of",43
NA,"yesterday, expressed support of the Govern-",43
NA,ment. It may be of interest to the House if,43
NA,I read some remarks that appeared in that,43
NA,editorial-,43
NA,Is it rational to take away a business-an d an,43
NA,air route is a business-tha t a company may have,43
NA,built up at considerable expense and give it to,43
NA,someone else?,43
NA,What would the response be if the Government,43
NA,the same principle to other kinds of,43
NA,"And, looking at it soberly, why should the",43
NA,Government have to move in to protect East-,43
NA,Airlines any more than it protects any other,43
NA,I may add that the only company in this,43
NA,field that it has protected is Ansett-A.N.A.,43
NA,Six companies have disappeared from the,43
NA,"civil aviation field, as I said earlier. The",43
NA,underlying the leader continues-,43
NA,"Takeover bids, in any case, are masters between",43
NA,"companies, and not the concern of governments.",43
NA,East-West Airlines has a comparative handful,43
NA,of shareholders. Ansett has thousands of share-,43
NA,holders who have just as much right to con-,43
NA,Government sideration as any others.,43
NA,That last paragraph is a rather illuminating,43
NA,"one to find in a leader in the "" Daily Tele-",43
NA,"graph"". That newspaper, as would be",43
NA,"expected, comes down on the side of mono-",44
NA,poly. I should say that people in small,44
NA,enterprises will be disturbed to find that,44
NA,that newspaper has very little to say for,44
NA,them.,44
NA,Mr Reynolds -Th e honorable member,44
NA,"knows the record of the "" Daily Telegraph """,44
NA,in take-overs.,44
Mr OCONNOR ,A s my honorable,44
NA,"friend has intimated, the Sydney "" Daily",44
NA,"Telegraph "" has indulged in take-overs, but",44
NA,so far it has not come out of them very,44
NA,well. The extract that I have just read,44
NA,from the newspaper's leader is typical of,44
NA,sort of thing that one would expect of a,44
NA,newspaper company that has made many,44
NA,thousands of pounds out of the community,44
NA,"in New South Wales and, for the assistance",44
NA,"of the community, can do nothing better",44
NA,"than endow to the tune of £10,000 a race",44
NA,"run at Randwick each year. The needy,",44
NA,the poor and those who are destitute receive,44
NA,nothing at all from the people who conduct,44
NA,"the "" Daily Telegraph "" newspaper. The",44
NA,proprietors of that journal consider that,44
NA,most worth-while contribution to com-,44
NA,munity welfare can be made by donating,44
NA,"£10,000 to the Australian Jockey Club in",44
NA,Sydney. The attitude of those who conduct,44
NA,this newspaper speaks for itself.,44
NA,I return now to the speech made last,44
NA,evening by the Prime Minister. Among,44
NA,"other things, he tried to evade the issue",44
NA,on the question of whether the statement,44
NA,alleged to have been made by the Minister,44
NA,for Civil Aviation was in fact made. The,44
NA,"Prime Minister, nowhere in his speech,",44
NA,faced up to that issue. He consistently,44
NA,ran away from it and tried to impose his,44
NA,own strangely improvised statute of limita-,44
NA,tions. He tried lo make out that the lapse,44
NA,of eighteen months since the incident in,44
NA,question was supposed to have happened,44
NA,was a sufficiently long time to warrant his,44
NA,refusing to consider the matter further.,44
NA,This brings me back to the Royal Com-,44
NA,mission on Timber Rights in the Territory,44
NA,"of Papua-New Guinea, which I mentioned",44
NA,"earlier. As I have said, that commission",44
NA,"was appointed, at the request of the honor-",44
NA,"able member for East Sydney, by letters",44
NA,"patent dated llth January. 1949, to inquire",44
NA,into certain transactions in relation to,44
NA,timber rights in the Territory of Papua,44
NA,"and New Guinea. The royal commissioner,",44
NA,"in the introduction to his report, stated-",44
NA,This inquiry arose out of a transaction embodied,44
NA,in two Deeds dated respectively the 19th Decem-,44
NA,"ber, 1944, and the 20th November, 1945 . . .",44
NA,"Incidentally, I may say that I do not think",44
NA,that any man has ever been acquitted so,44
NA,clearly and definitely of charges made,44
NA,against him as was the honorable member,44
NA,for East Sydney on that occasion.,44
NA,The pertinent point that I am making is,44
NA,that that royal commission was not appointed,44
NA,until about four years after the times in 1944,44
NA,and 1945 to which the allegations related.,44
NA,What a fatuous approach has been adopted,44
NA,the by the Prime Minister towards the matter,44
NA,at present at issue in attempting to play,44
NA,down its importance by stating that the,44
NA,allegations relate to a time eighteen months,44
NA,ago! Surely the time is not relevant. The,44
NA,"important question that should be answered,",44
NA,not only on behalf of the Minister but also,44
NA,on behalf of the Government is: Were these,44
NA,statements really made? Are the allegations,44
NA,correct or incorrect? If one accepts the,44
NA,"reasoning of the Prime Minister, one will",44
NA,"the take the view that, if more than eighteen",44
NA,months have elapsed since an incident is,44
NA,"alleged to have occurred, an inquiry into it",44
NA,"is impossible. Significantly, the Prime",44
NA,Minister at no time faced up to the ques-,44
NA,tion of whether the statement alleged to,44
NA,have been made was in fact made.,44
NA,I consider that the allegations are of such,44
NA,a kind as to warrant full investigation. I,44
NA,offer no opinion at all about whether they,44
NA,are correct or otherwise. I prefer to believe,44
NA,that they are not. Party opportunism and,44
NA,party advantage seem to have become the,44
NA,main considerations for the Prime Minister.,44
NA,He has accused us of participating in a,44
NA,political stunt by raising this matter on the,44
NA,"eve of an election, but his approach to the",44
NA,issue and his actions in relation to it leave,44
NA,him open to the charge that he is not un-,44
NA,mindful of the possible effect on the Go-,44
NA,vernment's election prospects of the appoint-,44
NA,ment of a royal commission now.,44
NA,"I appeal to the Government, even at this",44
NA,"late stage, to lake the right course and to",44
NA,uphold the standards of this House and of,44
NA,public life generally in Australia. In this,44
NA,"instance, prima facie evidence which has",44
NA,"been submitted to this House comes, not",44
NA,"from one reputable person, but from no",44
NA,fewer than four. How many persons does,45
NA,the Government require to make and sub-,45
NA,stantiate allegations before it will act? A,45
NA,sufficient answer is not to be found by say-,45
NA,ing that cordial relations have existed be-,45
NA,tween the Minister for Civil Aviation and,45
NA,East-West Airlines in the last eighteen,45
NA,"months, the cordiality of those relations",45
NA,"being shown in correspondence, and that",45
NA,this in itself is a sufficient reason why the,45
NA,matter need not be investigated. I say that,45
NA,this Parliament has a clear responsibility to,45
NA,investigate the issue and that it will fail to,45
NA,discharge that responsibility if it does not,45
NA,take the course suggested by the Deputy,45
NA,Leader of the Opposition. For these,45
NA,"reasons, I support the amendment that he",45
NA,has proposed.,45
Mr CHANEY ,Perth) [3.23] - Mr .,45
NA,Deputy Speaker,45
NA,NA,45
Mr CHANEY ,Th e honorable member,45
NA,ought to wait for it and not become tion,45
NA,"impatient. Probably, until the Deputy",45
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam),45
NA,"proposed his amendment, most of the bad light.",45
NA,speeches made in this debate had little or,45
NA,no relation to the bill. Now that the,45
NA,"amendment is before the House, honorable",45
NA,"members are at liberty, under the Standing",45
NA,"Orders, to discuss the matters that have",45
NA,arisen in the way in which the honorable,45
NA,member for Dalley ( Mr O'Connor) dealt will,45
NA,with them. He took as the authority for,45
NA,"his remarks the "" Sydney Morning Herald",45
NA,newspaper. I do not know whether or not on it.,45
NA,that newspaper can be relied on for,45
NA,accuracy. 1 think that most honorable,45
NA,members have learned that what the newsno,45
NA,"papers print is not always accurate. Indeed,",45
NA,honorable members on both sides of the this,45
NA,House have at various times had occasion,45
NA,complain in this place of gross misrepreproportions,45
NA,sentation in the newspapers.,45
NA,The text of the remarks made by the,45
NA,honorable member for Dalley was a passage,45
NA,"from a "" Sydney Morning Herald "" report,",45
NA,which was in these terms-,45
NA,Mr Shand said last night that on July,45
NA,Captain Smith submitted the following record of,45
NA,the meeting:,45
NA,"The details then follow, and the record of",45
NA,the meeting continues-,45
NA,Senator Paltridge was completely honest in his,45
NA,talks and does not bear any malice towards East-,45
NA,West Airlines.,45
NA,This is a record of the proceedings at a,45
NA,"meeting which took place on 7th July, 1960",45
NA,-mor e than twelve months before the,45
NA,account was submitted by Captain Smith.,45
NA,"As I have said, I do not know whether the",45
NA,statements made are true. I do not know,45
NA,whether or not to believe the newspaper.,45
NA,An Opposition member may accept this,45
NA,"statement, which was made more than",45
NA,"twelve months after the meeting, as being",45
NA,"an accurate record of what occurred, but I",45
NA,"refuse to believe that, even three weeks after",45
NA,"a meeting, somebody could commit to",45
NA,paper an account as long as that and vouch,45
NA,absolutely for its accuracy. We have had,45
NA,quoted in this House passages from corre-,45
NA,spondence between East-West Airlines,45
NA,Limited and the Minister for Civil Aviation,45
NA,(Senator Paltridge). Which account do we,45
NA,believe?,45
NA,I think it is unfortunate that the Opposi-,45
NA,"has attempted, in this debate, in some",45
NA,way or other to put the honorable member,45
NA,for New England ( Mr Drummond) in a,45
NA,NA,45
Mr CHANEY ,T o any one on this side,45
NA,"of the House, it appears to be a bad light.",45
NA,If you study carefully what he said you,45
NA,see that it is totally different from the,45
NA,interpretation that the newspapers and,45
NA,""" honorable members opposite are putting",45
NA,I do not want to devote my time to the,45
NA,"defence of somebody who, I believe, needs",45
NA,defence-th e Minister for Civil Aviation,45
NA,-an d I think that enough has been said on,45
NA,matter in this House. 1 believe that the,45
NA,to whole thing has been blown up out of all,45
NA,by the newspapers because,45
NA,there is nothing in the bill for them to,45
NA,comment on anyway. If there is a royal,45
NA,commission- I think that is in the terms of,45
NA,the amendmet.t moved by the Opposition-,45
NA,it should not inquire into the activities,45
NA,"of the Minister, but could well inquire into",45
NA,the activities of the New South Wales,45
NA,"29. 1961, Government and the company itself.",45
NA,NA,45
Mr CHANEY ,Jus t get these things,46
NA,right. We have heard the word,46
NA,""" pressurization"" used-no t in regard to",46
NA,"aircraft, but in regard to companies. I",46
NA,believe that pressurization has gone on in,46
NA,"totally different areas, and if honorable",46
NA,members accept the documented facts,46
NA,given in this House and in another place,46
NA,they must agree with that. The Leader of,46
NA,the Opposition in another place said only,46
NA,this morning that he accepted the word of,46
NA,"the Minister all along, but that it was",46
NA,obvious that somebody was telling a lie.,46
NA,This is totally different from the attitude,46
NA,adopted by the Opposition in this House.,46
NA,The honorable member for Dalley said,46
NA,that the Prime Minister was responsible,46
NA,to his own party. I do not think I am,46
NA,giving any secrets away when I say that,46
NA,the whole of the Prime Minister's party,46
NA,supported him and the Minister for Civil,46
NA,"Aviation in this matter, and without any",46
NA,"doubt. If the position were reversed, and",46
NA,the Labour Party were on this side of the,46
NA,"House, in government, no doubt the same",46
NA,charge as is made against us-tha t we,46
NA,were simply supporting the government in,46
NA,any event-woul d be made against Labour,46
NA,Party supporters. That is the most natural,46
NA,"thing in politics, as a study of the",46
NA,""" Hansard"" reports for the 60 years of",46
NA,the life of the Commonwealth Parliament,46
NA,will show.,46
NA,"Now I turn to the bill, which has not",46
NA,been discussed at all during the debate.,46
NA,The honorable member for Dalley and the,46
NA,Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that,46
NA,this was a clear-cut case of the Minister,46
NA,trying to destroy T.A.A. This is really,46
NA,"ludicrous in the extreme, as the record of",46
NA,T.A.A. soon shows. We should get back,46
NA,to the bill and forget about East-West,46
NA,"Airlines Limited, as I think honorable",46
NA,"members opposite could well do, because",46
NA,the whole thing has so obviously been,46
NA,whipped up into something big in the news-,46
NA,papers. Let us go back to the record of,46
NA,"T.A.A., which shows that the initial plan-",46
NA,ning for that airline was done in 1948.,46
NA,"From 1949 to 1961, T.A.A. has been",46
NA,under the control of the present Govern-,46
NA,"ment. If any Minister, including the",46
NA,Minister for Defence ( Mr Townley) who,46
NA,"is now at the table, and the present Minister",46
NA,for Civil Aviation had set out to destroy,46
NA,"T.A.A., how could we have the picture",46
NA,now presented in its own record? In the,46
NA,"two-year period that ended on 30th June,",46
NA,"1949, T.A.A. aircraft flew 132,225 hours,",46
NA,"embarked 798,570 passengers, travelled",46
NA,"376,346,800 passenger-miles, carried 18,675",46
NA,"short tons of freight and 2,162 short tons",46
NA,of mail. Over those two years T.A.A.,46
NA,"earned £6,828,000 total revenue, and in-",46
NA,"curred losses amounting to £392,000. The",46
NA,losses were incurred under the adminis-,46
NA,tration of the Labour Government.,46
NA,I am not critical of the loss incurred by,46
NA,"T.A.A. in those first two years, because in",46
NA,the initial stage of the establishment of an,46
NA,airline many non-recurring costs must be,46
NA,"met, and I think that earnings of nearly",46
NA,"£7,000,000, with a loss of £392,000, in a",46
NA,time when the airline had its teething,46
NA,"troubles, was a fairly worthwhile perform-",46
NA,"ance. In 1960, T.A.A.'s operations had",46
NA,"increased quite dramatically, as the figures",46
NA,for the financial year that ended on 30th,46
NA,"June, 1960, show. The hours flown totalled",46
NA,"86,795, as against an average of about",46
NA,"66,000 for each of the two years in the",46
NA,"period that ended on 30th June, 1949. It",46
NA,may be said at first glance that that is,46
NA,"only an increase of 30 per cent., but it",46
NA,must be remembered that that total of hours,46
NA,"was flown by faster aircraft, which covered",46
NA,more miles per hour. The growth in the,46
NA,airlines' activities is fairly high in actual,46
NA,fact- a growth which has occurred under,46
NA,"Ministers, who, according to the Opposition,",46
NA,have been trying to destroy T.A.A.,46
NA,Honorable members opposite can keep,46
NA,firmly in their minds that the Government,46
NA,"is determined to have a two-airline system,",46
NA,and is determined that neither T.A.A. nor,46
NA,the other major airline will be destroyed.,46
NA,It is easy for people who live in Melbourne,46
NA,or Sydney to say that this country could,46
NA,"do with a one major airline system, but it",46
NA,is a different story in Western Australia and,46
NA,"other remote parts of this continent, where",46
NA,it is difficult enough to get service on the,46
NA,line that is available.,46
NA,"In 1960, the number of passengers em-",46
NA,"barked had risen to 1,071,253 compared",46
NA,"with the average of about 390,000 for each",46
NA,of the two years of the period that ended,46
NA,"on 30th June, 1949. And this happened",46
NA,"while the Government, according to honor-",46
NA,"able members opposite, was trying to",46
NA,destroy the airline. What a magnificent,46
NA,kind of destruction! I hope that we try to,46
NA,destroy everything in Australia in the same,46
NA,way. Passenger miles travelled by the air-,47
NA,"line in 1960 were 513,319,100 as against",47
NA,"an average of about 180.000,000 in each of",47
NA,the other two years that 1 have mentioned.,47
NA,The freight carried in 1960 almost doubled,47
NA,compared with each of those other two,47
NA,years.,47
NA,Thosefiguresare the answer to the argu-,47
NA,ment which we hear time and time again,47
NA,that the Government is out to des-troy T.A.A.,47
NA,Now let us look at the particulars regarding,47
NA,"T.A.A.'s fleet of aircraft. In 1949, the air-",47
NA,line was operating with aircraft which were,47
NA,mostly surplus aircraft disposed of by the,47
NA,"armed forces. As at 30th June, 1949,",47
NA,"T.A.A. had just bought five Convair 240's,",47
NA,"three Douglas DC4's, nineteen Douglas",47
NA,"DC3 passenger aircraft, three Douglas DC3",47
NA,freighters and four de Havilland 84's. It,47
NA,"employed 3,393 persons. As a result of the",47
NA,so-called process of destruction undertaken,47
NA,"by this Government, with the various Minis-",47
NA,"ters using all their efforts to destroy T.A.A.,",47
NA,"somehow by 30th June, 1961, the airline",47
NA,"had acquired three Lockheed ISS's, two",47
NA,"Viscount 816's, ten Viscount 700's, nine",47
NA,"Fokker F27's, two Douglas DC6's, two",47
NA,"Douglas DC4's, nineteen Douglas DC3's,",47
NA,four de Havilland DHC3's and three Bell 47,47
NA,"helicopters. Its staff had risen from 3,393",47
NA,"in 1949, to 4,848.",47
NA,Mr Reynolds -Bu t have you thought,47
NA,what it might have done?,47
Mr CHANEY ,Thi s is the old story.,47
NA,What we are really debating is the two air-,47
NA,line system. Honorable members will recall,47
NA,the cross-charter arrangement under which,47
NA,DC6's owned by one airline were exchanged,47
NA,for Viscounts owned by the other. It was,47
NA,"a terrific deal, and according to members of",47
NA,the Opposition it was part of the attempt,47
NA,to destroy T.A.A. What actually happened,47
NA,was that the deal enabled that organization,47
NA,"to operate in New Guinea, which it other-",47
NA,wise would not have been able to do. I,47
NA,believe that if the exchange had not been,47
NA,made A.N.A. would have been in a position,47
NA,to provide cheaper tourist services with the,47
NA,"DC6's which carry 100 pas engers each,",47
NA,and could have cut into T.A.A.'s passenger,47
NA,"total. Remember, it is not necessary to have",47
NA,the kind of airline system under which pas-,47
NA,"sengers are served with chicken salad, and",47
NA,"so on. When people fly, their main object",47
NA,is to get to their destination. One of the,47
NA,greatest problems in our aviation to-day,47
NA,is not getting people from Sydney to Mel-,47
NA,"bourne, for instance, in a short time, but",47
NA,getting them to and from the various air-,47
NA,ports expeditiously.,47
NA,A lot has been said about rationalization.,47
NA,I believe that civil aviation is the spoiled,47
NA,child of the Australian transport industry. If,47
NA,other transport systems in Australia had,47
NA,received from governments the assistance,47
NA,that civil aviation has received we would,47
NA,hear less talk about railway deficits and bad,47
NA,roads. There was criticism from the,47
NA,Opposition also about air fares in,47
NA,Australia. Honorable members oppo-,47
NA,site claim that the Government's,47
NA,policy caused fares to increase. Aus-,47
NA,tralia's air fares compare more favorably,47
NA,"with those in other countries, as honorable",47
NA,members who have travelled abroad know,47
NA,quite well. The service provided also,47
NA,compares more than favorably. Anybody,47
NA,who has seen the internal airline system in,47
NA,Canada will agree with that statement. Over,47
NA,"there, you have to wait in a line like sheep",47
NA,"in a race, and when the starter's gun goes",47
NA,off you rush for the plane. The healthy,47
NA,young men get the seats they want and,47
NA,"husbands, wives and children come last.",47
NA,The service and the meals are both second-,47
NA,rale. Our own system certainly compares,47
NA,more than favorably with that.,47
NA,"In Australia, the first-class fare per",47
NA,passenger mile is 6.55d. In America the,47
NA,first-class fare is 7.62d. a passenger mile,47
NA,"although the service is much worse, not in",47
NA,terms of aircraft or control by the aero-,47
NA,nautics board but in terms of actual pas-,47
NA,senger comfort. The first-class fare on,47
NA,European airways is 13.3Id. a passenger,47
NA,mile. So where is the argument about Aus-,47
NA,"tralian fares? When it comes to tourist class,",47
NA,the fare of Australian services is 5.02d. a,47
NA,passenger mile compared with 10.55d. in,47
NA,Europe. I think it is time we had a rational,47
NA,look at this rationalization programme and,47
NA,"refrained from so many assumptions,",47
NA,making mountains out of molehills and,47
NA,initiating headlines in every newspaper in,47
NA,Australia about something that has no basis,47
NA,of fact.,47
NA,"On 5th September, I directed a series of",48
NA,questions to the Minister representing the,48
NA,Minister for Civil Aviation to this effect-,48
NA,1. What are the details of the public funds,48
NA,have been invested in the Government-owned Trans-,48
NA,Australia Airlines each year for the past ten,48
NA,2. What has been the (a) yearly and (b) average,48
NA,return to the Treasury in the nature of a dividend,48
NA,over the last ten years?,48
NA,3. Is this return on public moneys satisfactory,48
NA,having regard to the dividend paid by the privately-,48
NA,owned airline operator?,48
NA,"4. Does Trans-Australia Airlines have, in addi-",48
NA,"tion to capital provided by the Treasury, access to",48
NA,loans at rates less than those available to other,48
NA,operators?,48
NA,5. Does the Australian National Airlines Com-,48
NA,mission also have available for use in its business,48
NA,"some £4,000,000 of superannuation funds?",48
NA,There was criticism of this last matter to the,48
NA,effect that the Government was misusing,48
NA,superannuation funds. That was another,48
NA,statement that was made without any facts,48
NA,to support it. The Minister representing the,48
NA,Minister for Civil Aviation replied to me on,48
NA,27th September and the answers are to be,48
NA,"found at page 1437 of ""Hansard"". In",48
NA,"1946-47, when T.A.A. was first established,",48
NA,the capital subscribed during the year was,48
NA,"£2,170,000. In 1947-48, the capital was",48
NA,"increased by £1,500,000, and there was then",48
NA,"a progressive total of £3,670,000. Honor-",48
NA,able members may remember that in those,48
NA,days the initial fleets of DC3 aircraft from,48
NA,disposals could be procured for about,48
NA,"£10,000 or some such ridiculously low price",48
NA,because of the surplus of DC3 aircraft,48
NA,immediately after the Second World War. In,48
NA,"1948-49, there was an increase of £700,000",48
NA,"to £4,370,000.",48
NA,There was no need for capital finance,48
NA,between 1948-49 and 1957-58 because in,48
NA,"1948-49, the government of the day put",48
NA,into capital funds of T.A.A. a sufficient sum,48
NA,to see it over those years. The year 1949,48
NA,"was an election year, as honorable members",48
NA,"will recall. The next advance was £500,000",48
NA,"which made the total £4,870,000. In 1958-",48
NA,"59, capital subscribed totalled £1,000,000",48
NA,"making the total £5,870,000. There was an",48
NA,"increase of £500,000 in 1959-60, and the",48
NA,"total then was £6,370,000. In 1960-61,",48
NA,capital subscribed during the year totalled,48
NA,"£1,130,000 making a grand total of",48
NA,"£7,500,000 of which more than half had",48
NA,been advanced by this Government in its,48
NA,"efforts, according to honorable members",48
NA,"opposite, to destroy T.A.A. What a mag-",48
NA,"nificent argument! In 1950-51, the Aus-",48
NA,tralian National Airlines Commission paid in,48
NA,"the nature of a dividend £136,562, equal to",48
NA,which 3 i per cent. Nothing more was paid until,48
NA,1954-55 when there was a payment of,48
NA,"years? £131,000, equal to 3 per cent. The figure",48
NA,was fairly steady over the following five,48
NA,"years ranging from 4 per cent, to 5 per cent.",48
NA,This represented an average return of,48
NA,"£141,636 a year over each of the ten years",48
NA,"to 1959-60, just under 3 per cent. Ansett",48
NA,Transport Industries paid a steady dividend,48
NA,"of 10 per cent, and by normal commercial",48
NA,"standards, T.A.A. dividend is low.",48
NA,I believe that the Opposition generally,48
NA,would agree that T.A.A. is a business,48
NA,proposition and a highly successful one of,48
NA,which its employees can be justifiably,48
NA,proud. It is as well to remember that for,48
NA,"every person employed by T.A.A., a per-",48
NA,son and a fraction is employed by Ansett-,48
NA,A.N.A. Whatever you do to either com-,48
NA,pany affects a number of Australians in,48
NA,their employ. The Australian National,48
NA,Airlines Commission has three loans,48
NA,arranged on its behalf by the Govern-,48
NA,ment. One of them through Qantas Em-,48
NA,"pire Airways Limited is for 2,250,000",48
NA,"dollars and the others are for 3,000,000",48
NA,"dollars and 2,000,000 dollars through the",48
NA,Treasury. The rates of interest paid on,48
NA,them are lower than the rates of interest,48
NA,paid by Ansett-A.N.A. on its loans. The,48
NA,guarantees to Ansett-A.N.A. were not taken,48
NA,up fully and those that were taken up,48
NA,have been met on time.,48
NA,The Minister representing the Minister,48
NA,for Civil Aviation stated in reply to my,48
NA,fifth question-,48
NA,The accumulated superannuation funds of the,48
NA,"Airlines Commission total £3,759,000 of which",48
NA,"£525,000 is invested. The remainder is available",48
NA,for use in the business.,48
NA,Although I have heard one or two honor-,48
NA,able members say that they would not take,48
NA,the word of the Minister for Civil Avia-,48
NA,"tion (Senator Paltridge), these facts and",48
NA,"figures are published in "" Hansard"" and",48
NA,"cannot be denied. As I bave said, I would",48
NA,rather have had a full debate on the air-,48
NA,lines system and on the two bills that are,48
NA,before the House than have our time taken,48
NA,up by honorable members having to de-,48
NA,fend actions which needed no defence. I,48
NA,am quite certain that many people will,48
NA,look back on these years of administration,48
NA,by the Minister for Civil Aviation as a,49
NA,time when civil aviation in Australia made,49
NA,wonderful strides. He has kept civil avia-,49
NA,"tion in Australia at a level equal, or",49
NA,superior to that of any other system in,49
NA,the world.,49
Mr CALWELL ,Melbourne-Leade r of,49
NA,the Opposition) [3.42] - I seconded this,49
NA,amendment and I did so because I believe,49
NA,it is necessary to remind the House that,49
NA,the tradition of parliamentary government,49
NA,and ministerial responsibility lays it down,49
NA,that when any Minister is under challenge,49
NA,at any time by any person of having done,49
NA,anything that has even a semblance of,49
NA,"wrong-doing or favouritism, it is his duty",49
NA,either to be asked to be relieved of office,49
NA,or for the Leader of the Government to,49
NA,relieve him of his office.,49
NA,Mr Bur}' -Charge s made by whom?,49
Mr CALWELL,Charge s made by,49
NA,reputable people; and it cannot be denied,49
NA,that in this case charges have been made,49
NA,by reputable people. While no notice was,49
NA,taken of the charges when they were made,49
NA,by people outside this House-an d they,49
NA,should have been noticed-n o excuse can,49
NA,be given for refusing to take notice of,49
NA,the charges now that they have been,49
NA,reinforced by the testimony of the honor-,49
NA,able member for New England ( Mr.,49
NA,Drummond) about whom no member of,49
NA,the Liberal Party or of the Australian,49
NA,Country Party dare say an offensive word.,49
NA,"Mr Forbes -O n that basis, you should",49
NA,have resigned as Minister for Immigration,49
NA,once a week.,49
Mr CALWELL , I would not have had,49
NA,to resign once a week because nobody,49
NA,challenged my probity or integrity; and,49
NA,1 hope the honorable member will be able,49
NA,to go through his political life with as,49
NA,decent a record as I have in this regard.,49
NA,This is not merely a question of judgment.,49
NA,This is a question of favoritism.,49
NA,I can well remember two instances,49
NA,the last 30 years when two Liberal Party,49
NA,"Ministers, after the government of the day",49
NA,had been asked to appoint a royal commisliamentary,49
NA,sion to inquire into charges that they,49
NA,"acted imprudently, resigned their portlast",49
NA,folios because they felt it was the proper,49
NA,thing to do. One was the late Senator,49
NA,A. J. MCLachlan who was a Minister,49
NA,when the secretary of a company stated in,49
NA,an annual report that he had been favor-,49
NA,ably disposed to the placing of contracts,49
NA,in favour of the company. That was suf-,49
NA,ficent. The Senator resigned from the,49
NA,Ministry and was never again included in,49
NA,"it. In 1940, the then Minister for Cus-",49
NA,"toms, the late John Lawson, resigned from",49
NA,the Ministry because he happened to lease,49
NA,a racehorse from Mr W. J. Smith the day,49
NA,after he had made an agreement on,49
NA,behalf of the Government with Mr Smith,49
NA,for the making of motor cars in Australia.,49
NA,I am perfectly satisfied that there was,49
NA,nothing sinister or improper in anything,49
NA,that Mr Lawson or Mr Smith did. But,49
NA,immediately the matter was mentioned in,49
NA,public there was a furore. Mr Lawson,49
NA,motored all through the night from the,49
NA,"Macquarie electorate, which he represented,",49
NA,to Melbourne and handed the then Prime,49
NA,"Minister, Mr Menzies, his resignation.",49
NA,"To-day, the Prime Minister ( Mr Menzies)",49
NA,and the Minister for Civil Aviation (Senator,49
NA,Paltridge) try to brazen it out when charges,49
NA,are laid that the Minister has consistently,49
NA,favoured Ansett-A.N.A. in all its dealings,49
NA,lo the detriment of Trans-Australia Airlines,49
NA,"and worse than that, that he tried to apply",49
NA,pressure to East-West Airlines Limited to,49
NA,come to an arrangement with Ansett-A.N.A.,49
NA,about their activities.,49
NA,Mr Whitlam -T o get together.,49
Mr CALWELL ,"""T o get together""",49
NA,"were the words that were used. First, he",49
NA,said he did not use the words. It was,49
NA,only when the honorable member for New,49
NA,England said he heard him use them that,49
NA,the Minister said he may have used them.,49
NA,His memory became good only when he,49
NA,was presented with the irrefutable evidence,49
NA,that he did say what he denied he had said.,49
NA,The members of the Liberal Party are,49
NA,trying to keep up their courage by suggest-,49
NA,ing that this is a political stunt. They say,49
NA,we have no justification for asking ior a,49
NA,over royal commission to inquire into these,49
NA,matters. We say we have every justifica-,49
NA,"tion, in accordance with tradition and par-",49
NA,"practice, for asking for a royal",49
NA,had commission. The Prime Minister's speech,49
NA,night explained nothing. As the Deputy,49
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam),49
NA,"said, all he did was to prove that he was",49
NA,"very selective, if not very avid, in his",49
NA,reading of letters. He indulged in a good,50
NA,"deal of clowning, quoting from kindly,",50
NA,"friendly, almost sen timer. U'1 letters.",50
NA,"commenced "" Dear Shar.e"", others com-",50
NA,"menced "" Dear Don "" and "" Dear Archie "";",50
NA,"but none commenced "" Dear Reg"",",50
NA,"although "" Dear Reg"" is more than dear",50
NA,in any ssnse of the term. He has been,50
NA,too dear to the Australian people.,50
NA,If this Government had treated the late,50
NA,S'.r Ivan Hoiyman and Australian National,50
NA,A'.rways Proprietary Limited half as,50
NA,generously as it has treated Ansett-A.N.A.,50
NA,Auitralian National Airways would never,50
NA,h -.ve been forced out of business and,50
NA,dis* -cyed. A rationalization committee was,50
NA,establ sh;d. Everything that Ansett-A.N.A.,50
NA,has evir asked of the rationalization com-,50
NA,mittee it has obtained. It is true it did,50
NA,not always get what it wanted on the,50
NA,"first occasion it asked. However, in accord-",50
NA,ance with the principle of Bruce and the,50
NA,"spider, it was try, try again. Ansett-A.N.A.",50
NA,has not always had to wait very long.,50
NA,We were told that its claims to fly to New,50
NA,Guinea and to fly to Darwin from Mount,50
NA,Isa and Alice Springs would not be granted;,50
NA,but these claims have been acceded to.,50
NA,Now the chairman of the rationalization,50
NA,"committee, who acted as co-ordinator",50
NA,when the other two members of the com-,50
NA,"mittee disagreed, has resigned, and the",50
NA,"position goes back to the Minister, who",50
NA,"must make a decision, according to the",50
NA,terms of the bill.,50
NA,If everything is above board with this,50
NA,Government's administration and with the,50
NA,Minister it is extraordinary that when,50
NA,T.A.A. appealed against the application by,50
NA,Ansett-A.N.A. for the right to fly into,50
NA,Darwin from Mount Isa and from Alice,50
NA,"Springs, it was told that the appeal would",50
NA,"not be heard because the Minister, under",50
NA,"some other power, had given Ansett-A.N.A.",50
NA,the right to do so. We say that this is,50
NA,mal-administration and distinct favori-,50
NA,tism and we say it has been accorded at,50
NA,the expense of the Australian people.,50
NA,Mr Luchetti -I t is patronage.,50
Mr CALWELL,I t is a very bad form,50
NA,of patronage. We know very well there,50
NA,must be two airlines. We tried to,50
NA,"nationalize the airlines and we failed, so",50
NA,cannot nationalize the airlines of Australia.,50
NA,There must be two airlines or more than,50
NA,two airlines. There cannot be one Govern-,50
NA,ment airline; but there can be one private,50
NA,"enterprise airline, and that is what Ansett-",50
NA,Some A.N.A. wants. Mr Ansett has already,50
NA,demanded-th e Government so far has,50
NA,refused his application-tha t the Govern-,50
NA,ment should sell out its interest in T.A.A.,50
NA,to a corporation in which the Government,50
NA,would have a certain percentage of shares.,50
NA,That would be the first step towards the,50
NA,sell-out of the whole of the shares to the,50
NA,"private shareholders in the corporation,",50
NA,preparatory to its being gobbled up by Mr.,50
NA,Ansett.,50
NA,When the Minister for Civil Aviation,50
NA,advised East-West Airlines Limited to talk,50
NA,"matters over with Mr Ansett, he was tell-",50
NA,ing the company to emulate the fly and,50
NA,walk into the spider's web. When Mr.,50
NA,"Ansett talks to people, he talks for the",50
NA,purpose of devouring them. He does not,50
NA,talk for any other purpose. He devoured,50
NA,Butler Air Transport Limited and he was,50
NA,able to defeat A.N.A. by skimming the,50
NA,cream off the traffic between Sydney and,50
NA,Melbourne in opposition to A.N.A. and,50
NA,T.A.A. When Butler tried to obtain dollars,50
NA,from this Government to do to Ansett what,50
NA,"Ansett did to A.N.A., the Government",50
NA,"said: "" No. We do not believe in private",50
NA,enterprise to that extent. We will not allow,50
NA,Butler to compete with Ansett on the same,50
NA,terms as Ansett competed with A.N.A.,50
NA,before he destroyed it and then gobbled it,50
NA,"up."" That is the sort of spurious, phony,",50
NA,free enterprise in which this Government,50
NA,believes.,50
NA,Mr Murray -Wha t would you like to,50
NA,see happen to Ansett?,50
Mr CALWELL , I would like to see,50
NA,Ansett trade on fair terms and he is not,50
NA,trading on fair terms.,50
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,Yo u would like to,50
NA,see him out of business.,50
Mr CALWELL , I would like to see a,50
NA,royal commission appointed to inquire into,50
NA,all the activities of the department and,50
NA,"before I see Ansett out of business, I",50
NA,would like to see you out of business.,50
NA,There are rumours circulating-the y may,50
NA,have some substance-tha t the Government,50
NA,forced T.A.A. to take Electra aircraft,50
NA,we because Ansett had adopted these aircraft.,50
NA,T.A.A. did not want them. The Lockheed,50
NA,organization came in. The rumours are,50
NA,that Ansett is tied up with that American,50
NA,concern and that his company is receiving,51
NA,"commission on all these sales, even those",51
NA,to T.A.A. The rumours are that he made,51
NA,a deal to help relieve himself of his finan-,51
NA,"cial obligations, and the Government knows",51
NA,all about it.,51
NA,Mr Turnbull -The y are only rumours.,51
Mr CALWELL ,O f course they are in,51
NA,"only rumours, I know, just like other",51
NA,rumours going around. There is too much,51
NA,foreign capital coming into the country,51
NA,present. Too much foreign capital is taksouth-eastern,51
NA,ing over too many of our essential enterBut,51
NA,prises. We hear a lot about the Hong service.,51
NA,"Kong capital of £500,000,000, but there",51
NA,a lot of American capital coming in. too.,51
NA,We want an investigation into all,51
NA,matters and we want to know how far the.,51
NA,Government is involved. We believe that,51
NA,the Minister is covering up. We expected,51
NA,members of the Australian Country Party,51
NA,to support the honorable member for New,51
NA,England. He did not decide to make his,51
NA,statement here in the heat of passion.,51
NA,told me all this story about a month,51
NA,at the Mascot airport and others have been Australia.,51
NA,telling me a good deal about it for some,51
NA,time past. But members of the Country,51
NA,Party generally seem to be vying with Goto,51
NA,vernment supporters in rushing to the that,51
NA,defence of the Ansett group. They are,51
NA,"all very decent fellows personally, of",51
NA,"course, but, speaking about them politically,",51
NA,they are just a jackal pack that feeds on,51
NA,what is left of the spoil after the lions,51
NA,liberalism have had their fill. There is,51
NA,ing independent about them. They have,51
NA,separate judgment. They just trail on beT.A.A.,51
NA,hind the people who do the kill. This,51
NA,"Government wants lo kill T.A.A., a build",51
NA,"government enterprise, and we want to be",51
NA,prevent that from happening. The honor20,51
NA,able member for Mallee ( Mr Turnbull),51
NA,does not believe in government enterprise,51
NA,at all.,51
NA,Mr Turnbull - I do not believe in,51
NA,socialism. You can put that down.,51
Mr CALWELL,"I n that respect, you",51
NA,"differ from the Prime Minister, because he",51
NA,"does. In fact, he practices it but does not",51
NA,"admit it. According to the news to-day,",51
NA,Mr Ansett said that he would fight the,51
NA,South Wales Government lo the very last,51
NA,limit. For what reason? The Government,51
NA,of New South Wales wants to restrict,51
NA,"to 51 per cent, of the intra-state traffic in",51
NA,"New South Wales, and that is not enough.",51
NA,"The other company is to have 49 per cent,",51
NA,"and, in Mr Ansett's view, that is too much.",51
NA,And Mr Ansett has all the intra-state,51
NA,traffic in every other State of the Common-,51
NA,"wealth, except in Western Australia. He",51
NA,has already crushed out Southern Airlines,51
NA,Victoria and extinguished many flights.,51
NA,He has already taken over the Mount,51
NA,"Gambier service in South Australia, and",51
NA,at disadvantaged the people living in the,51
NA,portion of that State too.,51
NA,"Mr Ansett is concerned with profit, not",51
NA,When it comes to a question of sub-,51
NA,"is sidy, why should not this Government make",51
NA,payments to airlines operating in scattered,51
NA,areas in order to promote decentralization,51
NA,these and development? What is wrong with,51
NA,that? We are all for it. We helped it. We,51
NA,carried on the work which this Government,51
NA,did in other days when it helped Connellan,51
NA,Airways Limited in the Northern Territory.,51
NA,And Mr Ansett has cast his covetous eyes,51
NA,"on that company, also. He has also cast his",51
NA,"He greedy, covetous eyes on the MACRobertson",51
NA,ago Miller Airlines Limited in Western,51
NA,There is no line that he does not want,51
NA,"absorb or take over, and there is nothing",51
NA,"he will not do. But, to finance it all,",51
NA,he will ask the Australian people to sub-,51
NA,"scribe to his notes, and he will pay them 8",51
NA,"per cent, or 9 per cent, interest. He will",51
NA,"have to earn 16 per cent, or 17 per cent, on",51
NA,of his investment to pay that amount of,51
NA,"nothinterest, and he is so powerful with the",51
NA,no Government that the Government has tolJ,51
NA,"in this legislation, that it must earn",51
NA,"10 per cent, and make sufficient profit to",51
NA,up reserves so that Ansett-A.N.A. can,51
NA,maintained in afinancialstate. In other,51
NA,"words, fares may have to go up by about",51
NA,"per cent, as a result of this legislation.",51
NA,"We say that is all wrong, and that that in",51
NA,itself is sufficient reason for having a royal,51
NA,commission.,51
NA,Then there is the announcement that Mr.,51
NA,Ansett has cancelled all his advertisements in,51
NA,"the "" Daily Mirror"" newspaper in Sydney,",51
NA,"in the Sydney "" Sun "" and in the "" News "" in",51
NA,Adelaide because they dared lo criticize him.,51
NA,He is being kept going with government,51
NA,New money. No doubt there will be more to,51
NA,"follow, because nobody must dare to try",51
NA,and thwart Mr Ansett; nobody must,51
NA,him attempt to frustrate him; nobody must,51
NA,oppose him. Those who stand in his way,52
NA,"must be crushed, and he has decided that",52
NA,these newspapers cannot have advertise-,52
NA,"ments if they will not back him, if they",52
NA,will not support him at every turn. He is,52
NA,"a standover man, and everybody who votes",52
NA,against our proposed amendment will be,52
NA,"voting for standover tactics, and standover",52
NA,tactics are unacceptable to any decent,52
NA,"democrat, or to anybody who believes in",52
NA,the rule of law.,52
NA,This Government has much to answer,52
NA,for. It did not want these revelations. It,52
NA,thought it could bluff its way through on,52
NA,this legislation. That is why it brought the,52
NA,bill down right at the last minute. But it,52
NA,had one other reason. Mr Ansett has told,52
NA,the Government that if it does not control,52
NA,the Senate after 1st July of next year it,52
NA,"be too late to bring the bill down then, so",52
NA,it has got to be put through while the Go-,52
NA,vernment has a lot of dumb driven cattle,52
NA,that it can muster into voting for its bills,52
NA,while it still has the control of both Houses.,52
NA,The Government will not wait for the,52
NA,people's vote on this matter on 9th Decem-,52
NA,ber. But we will take the issue to the,52
NA,people. This will be one of the election,52
NA,issues. We may not be able to remove the,52
NA,honorable member for Mallee from the pre-,52
NA,"cincts of the House, but we hope to deplete",52
NA,the ranks of the Country Party and to de-,52
NA,plete the ranks of the Liberal Party too.,52
NA,We hope the people of Australia will vote,52
NA,"for decency in government, that they will",52
NA,return a Labour government that will in-,52
NA,vestigate all these matters. We will carry,52
NA,"on a two-airline system, but it will be done",52
NA,"on fair lines, not in the way in which this",52
NA,"Government has operated, the way of slow",52
NA,"attrition, by which T.A.A. is to be destroyed",52
NA,gradually and slowly so that the Govern-,52
NA,ment will be able to say in the end that,52
NA,"T.A.A. failed because of inefficiency, mis-",52
NA,"management, or something else. I have",52
NA,more faith in the common sense of my fel-,52
NA,low Australians than I have in the decency,52
NA,of the majority of members of this Go-,52
NA,vernment.,52
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,Higgins-Trea - the,52
NA,"surer) [4.2] -M y colleague, the Minister",52
NA,Civil Aviation (Senator Paltridge) summed,52
NA,up the Labour Party's performance on this,52
NA,"matter as an infamous political stunt,",52
NA,anybody who has examined in a fair-minded,52
NA,way the facts and the statements which,52
NA,have appeared publicly will have no hesita-,52
NA,tion in joining him in that verdict.,52
NA,This has been one of the most shameful,52
NA,and disgraceful political performances on,52
NA,the part of any Labour Party that I have,52
NA,encountered in all my time in this Parlia-,52
NA,ment. We do not have to go very far to,52
NA,"find the motives behind the vicious, savage",52
NA,attack which has been made in this cham-,52
NA,"ber by honorable members opposite. First,",52
NA,there is their general political philosophy.,52
NA,The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell),52
NA,now tells us that they tried to socialize the,52
NA,airlines of this country. Of course they,52
NA,tried! The very fact that to-day we do,52
NA,not have socialized airlines in Australia,52
NA,is due to no lack of effort or determina-,52
NA,tion on the part of honorable members,52
NA,will opposite. And they are not confined to,52
NA,socializing the airlines. Each and every,52
NA,one of them is pledged to socializing great,52
NA,sections of Australian industry. When the,52
NA,"Leader of the Opposition now says, "" We",52
NA,"will have a two-line air policy "", what sort",52
NA,of faith in the future could any private,52
NA,operator have? What sort of faith could,52
NA,he have in the continuity and success of his,52
NA,airline enterprise under a government made,52
NA,up of men who have the attitude of mind,52
NA,revealed to us in the course of this debate?,52
NA,The Leader of the Opposition says that,52
NA,"they cannot nationalize the airlines, there-",52
NA,fore they will have a two-line air policy. He,52
NA,is trying to put it to us that the thing,52
NA,which is really holding them back is the,52
NA,constitutional limitation. They tried; but,52
NA,they were frustrated. But anybody who,52
NA,has had experience of administration in the,52
NA,government of this country knows that by,52
NA,"the exercise of administration, if you have",52
NA,the necessary numbers in the House of,52
NA,"Representatives and in the Senate, you do",52
NA,not need any change in the Constitution in,52
NA,order to establish in the result what you,52
NA,are after by way of nationalization.,52
NA,If ever we needed proof of the way in,52
NA,which the Labour Party would go about,52
NA,"dealing with a private operator, we have it",52
NA,in this case; and we have it not merely on,52
NA,evidence of what has been said but on,52
NA,for the performance of the State Government,52
NA,"of New South Wales. Some time ago, after",52
NA,hearing the federal president or-a s I think,52
NA,and he became almost immediately afterwards-,52
NA,the federal secretary of the Australian,52
NA,"Labour Party, announce that nationalization",53
NA,of banking was still the policy of the Labour,53
NA,Party-h e returned to that about three or,53
NA,four times in the course of the succeeding,53
NA,week- I said that a Labour Party with the,53
NA,necessary majority in both of these Houses,53
NA,could set out to nationalize the banking,53
NA,"system, in effect, by the way in which it",53
NA,dealt administratively with the trading bank,53
NA,"system of this country. If that is true, as I",53
NA,"believe it is, of the banking system, it is",53
NA,true to an even greater degree of the airline,53
NA,"industry, which is infinitely more vulnerable",53
NA,to administrative pressures from the,53
NA,Government.,53
NA,The Labour Party having failed in its,53
NA,"determined bid to socialize the airlines,",53
NA,we came into office we saw to it that there,53
NA,"was a two-airline system in Australia, and",53
NA,we have dealt as fairly as we could with,53
NA,each of those airlines. I think it,53
NA,verifiable fact that government air traffic,53
NA,is shown to be very much heavier with,53
NA,"Trans-Australia Airlines, the government",53
NA,"airline, than with the privately owned",53
NA,line. That is partly because the timetables,53
NA,arranged by the national airline make it,53
NA,more convenient for members of this Parbest,53
NA,liament to use that airline rather than,53
NA,other. I mention that as a demonstrable,53
NA,fact. Far from the Government acting in,53
NA,a way prejudicial to the government-owned,53
NA,"airline, government traffic is substantially",53
NA,higher with that airline than with the,53
NA,privately owned airline. In relation,53
NA,"equipment, aircraft, postal services and",53
NA,"on, we have done what we could to hold",53
NA,the scales evenly between the two airlines.,53
NA,"I repeat, therefore, that if we are looking",53
NA,"for motives behind this shabby, and",53
NA,"quite odious, performance on the part of",53
NA,"honorable gentlemen opposite, one of",53
NA,motives undoubtedly is their lingering deterto,53
NA,mination to do what they can to put the,53
NA,private airline operator out of business,53
NA,ensure that only a government monopoly,53
NA,"remains. The second motive, of course,",53
NA,the obvious political motive. They are,53
NA,getting near to an election. They are,53
NA,desperate for material. They have not,53
NA,"taken a trick in the course of this session,",53
NA,and they know that in public opinion the ment-,53
NA,"Government remains high. So, hunting",53
NA,"around for material, this is one of the flimsy",53
NA,objectives that they seize on in order to Commonwealth,53
NA,launch some sort of an attack. It is such,53
NA,an irresponsible and ill-planned attack that,53
NA,if we were to adopt the amendment which,53
NA,"they now put before us, this agreement",53
NA,which has been entered into by all the,53
NA,"parties, including the government airline",53
NA,"and the private airline-o f which, I under-",53
NA,"stand, a Labour candidate, in the person",53
NA,"of Sir George Jones, is a director-woul d",53
NA,be just completely null and void. It could,53
NA,not operate at all if we were to join with,53
NA,the Labour Party in adopting this ridiculous,53
NA,move that it has put before us to-day.,53
NA,I have used strong language in describ-,53
NA,ing the Labour Party's performance in this,53
NA,episqde. it does not derive its strength,53
NA,when only from the motives I have mentioned.,53
NA,The real motive behind this performance,53
NA,and this very effective piece of teamwork,53
NA,between the Labour Opposition in this place,53
NA,is a and the Government in New South,53
NA,Wales is a very different objective indeed.,53
NA,"Now, Sir, just look at the significance of",53
NA,the events. These charges are made about,53
NA,airmy colleague not at the time when the,53
NA,"events occurred but, as the Prime Minister",53
NA,"( Mr Menzies) demonstrated last night, the",53
NA,part of eighteen months subsequently.,53
NA,the Why are they made at this time? I do not,53
NA,suggest that those gentlemen who are,53
NA,associated with East-West Airlines Limited,53
NA,are out to score any political trick against,53
NA,"this Government but, at the risk of being",53
NA,"accused of having a cynical turn of mind,",53
NA,to I say that they cannot be unmindful of,53
NA,so the advantage tactically that they have in,53
NA,pressing these matters with a government,53
NA,"on the eve of an election, and doing what",53
NA,they can to persuade the New South Wales,53
NA,Government also to take some tactical ad-,53
NA,indeed vantage from that situation.,53
NA,What we have found is this: The New,53
NA,the South Wales Government has now agreed,53
NA,a very radical and far-reaching change,53
NA,in the domestic airline arrangement. I am,53
NA,"and not going to try to cover all the details,",53
NA,but I shall quote a comment made by the,53
NA,"is State Opposition leader, Mr Askin, when",53
NA,this matter developed inside his own Parlia-,53
NA,"ment. He is reported in the ""Daily Tele-",53
NA,"graph "" on 25th October as having, outside",53
NA,"the Parliament, said of the State Govern-",53
NA,The Government's action is high-handed and,53
NA,typical,53
NA,of the socialist planners. Although the,53
NA,heavily subsidizes both airlines.,53
NA,"apparently the State Government, which con-",54
NA,"tributes nothing, has most of the say.",54
NA,I understand the State Government made no,54
NA,effort to get the two companies together to try,54
NA,to evolve a mutually satisfactory rationalization,54
NA,plan.,54
NA,"Instead, the Government preferred to act",54
NA,arbitrarily.,54
NA,The onus rests heavily on the Government to,54
NA,establish that what it proposes is in the public,54
NA,interest and will not result in poorer facilities.,54
NA,Let me turn for a moment to what was,54
NA,said on this matter by Captain Middlemiss,54
NA,"who is, I understand, the general manager",54
NA,of Airlines of New South Wales Proprietary,54
NA,"Limited, the competitor of East-West Air-",54
NA,"lines Limited. Last night, he said that",54
NA,the route changes would cost his company,54
NA,"£500,000 a year. 1 am not adopting that",54
NA,estimate. I do not know whether it is,54
NA,"accurate, but 1 am quoting the remarks",54
NA,of the man who is general manager of the,54
NA,"company affected. Now, Sir, having in",54
NA,mind that this is the serious financial result,54
NA,which can proceed from this rearrangement,54
NA,by the New South Wales Labour Govern-,54
NA,"ment, the whole matter takes on, I believe,",54
NA,a very much more sinister turn. I can only,54
NA,deduct- 1 try to do so as fairly as I can-,54
NA,from the circumstances that because it was,54
NA,known that the action to be taken would,54
NA,result in very heavy losses for the airline,54
NA,"company conducted by Ansett, the New",54
NA,"South Wales Labour Government, in team-",54
NA,"work with the Labour Party in this place,",54
NA,set out to create a smoke-screen by trying,54
NA,to blacken the name of one of the most,54
NA,"decent, devoted and able Ministers who",54
NA,has ever served this country. And when I,54
NA,say that this is a shameful and disgraceful,54
NA,"episode, it is on that conclusion that I",54
NA,principally base my charge. In order to,54
NA,distract public attention from the fact that,54
NA,"one airline, the Ansett subsidiary, is to be",54
NA,deprived of a considerable part of its,54
NA,"revenue, we have had this attack on my",54
NA,colleague. Most of us who have some,54
NA,"knowledge of public affairs, have marvelled",54
NA,at how such publicity and weight of attack,54
NA,could have been built upon such a flimsy,54
NA,basis as was put before us. It is only,54
NA,when all the facts emerge and the actions,54
NA,of the Gos'ernment of New South Wales,54
NA,now become clearly known that we can,54
NA,perceive more clearly why these things are,54
NA,being done.,54
NA,I do not think this performance will,54
NA,delude anybody if the facts can be brought,54
NA,fully into the light of day. I am certain,54
NA,that nobody on this side of the House will,54
NA,fall for the political trick contained in the,54
NA,amendment moved by the Deputy Leader,54
NA,of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam). The,54
NA,Government has done its fairest and best to,54
NA,see to it that we have an efficient air,54
NA,"transport system for the people of Australia,",54
NA,with active competition on equal terms,54
NA,between the Government line and the free,54
NA,"enterprise line. I do not find, as I move",54
NA,"around, any criticism that the Government",54
NA,leans to one organization rather than to the,54
NA,"other, but on the facts, how can there be",54
NA,that kind of criticism?,54
NA,We have heard a most vicious personal,54
NA,"attack on Mr Ansett. 1 hold no brief for,",54
NA,"nor am I the defender of Mr Ansett, but",54
NA,I do know that this man has been one of,54
NA,the great pioneering figures in commercial,54
NA,aviation in Australia and that there are,54
NA,areas of Australia which probably would,54
NA,never to this day have had air services had,54
NA,he not been prepared to make the effort,54
NA,and take the risks involved in that kind,54
NA,of operation. The Leader of the Opposition,54
NA,( Mr Calwell) in a typical distortion of the,54
NA,"facts, talked about Mr Ansett having taken",54
NA,over a certain airline in South Australia.,54
NA,My understanding is that this was an,54
NA,airline which Mr Ansett himself h3d,54
NA,established. It was his own airline. How,54
NA,can he be accused of having gobbled up,54
NA,something which he himself established?,54
NA,That is the sort of basis upon which these,54
NA,rotten charges are made and I hope the,54
NA,Parliament will give short shrift to the,54
NA,performance of the Opposition in this,54
NA,matter. I think we can quite reasonably,54
NA,leave the verdict not only to this House,54
NA,but also to the judgment of all decent people,54
NA,outside this Parliament.,54

NA,"Murray, J.",56
NA,"Opperman, H . F.",56
NA,and the new government will have an,56
NA,opportunity to consider the entire civil,56

NA,no urgency about the ratification of this,56
NA,new Civil Aviation Agreement. I remind,56
NA,Wentworth. W. C.,56
NA,"Wheeler, R. C.",56
NA,the committee that the existing agreement,56
NA,"does not expire until 1967. However, the",56
NA,new agreement will extend for a further ten,56
NA,Tellers:,56
NA,Pearce. H. G.,56
NA,years beyond that time. I take some con-,56
NA,"vincing, as, I think, do a lot of other people,",56
NA,that a new agreement has become urgently,56
NA,NOES. necessary six years before the date of expiry,56
NA,"of ihe existing one. However, that appears",56
NA,to be the situation as presented to us by the,56
NA,Government.,56
NA,Why does the Government hasten to,56
NA,"Reynolds, L. J.",56
NA,"Russell, E. H . D .",56
NA,enter into a new agreement at this stage?,56
NA,What it proposes is a complete negation of,56
NA,democratic government. We are right on,56
NA,Tellers: the eve of a general election and the people,56
NA,Duthie. G. W. A . will shortly have an opportunity to pass,56
NA,judgment on this Government and its legis-,56
NA,PAIRS. lative measures. The Government is,56
NA,"attempting to make certain that, regardless",56
NA,"of the way in which the people decide,",56
NA,Ansett-A.N.A. will be quite safe under the,56
NA,terms of the new agreement. The Govern-,56
NA,"Lawson, George ment is afraid. Has not the Prime Minis-",56
NA,Minogue. D.,56
NA,ter ( Mr Menzies) already announced pub-,56
NA,"licly the danger that the Government, even",56
NA,if it scrapes by in the election for the,56
NA,"House of Representatives, is almost certain",56
NA,to lose control of the Senate? If it loses,56
NA,"control of the Senate, obviously the new",56
NA,"agreement will be in danger, for the Govern-",56
NA,ment would not be certain to have a,56
NA,measure such as this passed after the elec-,56
NA,tion. So it has tried to hasten through the,56
NA,passage of this bill in an effort deliberately,56
NA,day on to defeat the decision of the people at the,56
NA,poll on 9th December next.,56
NA,I consider that no reasonable Australian,56
NA,citizen will regard the new agreement as,56
NA,the being of the utmost urgency. The Trea-,56
NA,"surer ( Mr Harold Holt), earlier in the",56
NA,"debate on this bill, said that if the Opposi-",57
NA,tion had its way the Civil Aviation Agree-,57
NA,"ment"" would be ended. Does he suggest",57
NA,that the existing agreement will end if the,57
NA,measure that we are now considering does,57
NA,not come into operation until six months,57
NA,after the new Parliament assembles?,57
NA,"The amendment is a reasonable one,",57
NA,"however a person looks at it. All that we,",57
NA,"as democrats, are asking, is that the elec-",57
NA,"tors, who really determine the government",57
NA,"of the country, be not prevented from",57
NA,making their decision on the issue. I sug-,57
NA,"gest that we ought not to pass, right on",57
NA,"the eve of a general election, legislation so",57
NA,contentious and so important as this bill,57
NA,is. I hope that a majority of the members,57
NA,of the committee will acknowledge the,57
NA,reasonableness of this amendment and will,57
NA,agree to it.,57
Mr CAIRNS ,Yarra) [4.40] - Mr Chairby,57
NA,"man, I second the amendment proposed",57
NA,the honorable member for East Sydney,57
NA,"( Mr Ward), which I wholeheartedly",57
NA,support.,57
The CHAIRMAN , Mr Lucock) -Ther,57
NA,is no need for it to be seconded.,57
Mr CAIRNS ,"Tha t is so, Sir. The",57
NA,"amendment is a simple but, nevertheless,",57
NA,"important one, and we all ought to support",57
NA,it. We in this committee have a right and,57
NA,responsibility to ask a number of very,57
NA,significant questions. The committee and,57
NA,people of Australia have a right to have,57
NA,-those questions answered. The purpose,57
NA,of the amendment is to have the measure,57
NA,"come into operation, not on the day on",57
NA,"which it receives the Royal assent, but six",57
NA,months after the Twenty-fourth Parliament,57
NA,first assembles. If its operation is delayed,57
NA,"in this manner, not only the Parliament",57
NA,also the people of Australia will have,57
NA,opportunity to consider what is involved,57
NA,in the agreement to which the bill relates.,57
NA,"The Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt), some",57
NA,"time ago, said that what was involved in",57
NA,this measure was the question of whether,57
NA,two-airline policy or a one-airline policy,57
NA,"to operate, although the Leader of the",57
NA,sition ( Mr Calwell) had made quite clear,57
NA,that this was not the issue and that somewith,57
NA,"thing else was involved. What is involved,",57
NA,"Mr Chairman, is the integrity of the",57
NA,vernment. The Civil Aviation Agreement,57
NA,under which the airlines are now operating,57
NA,does not expire until 1967. Yet the Govern-,57
NA,"ment has considered it necessary, in the",57
NA,"closing stages of the life of this Parliament,",57
NA,to introduce a bill which not only will pro-,57
NA,vide for a new agreement to cover the next,57
NA,six years but also will extend the period for,57
NA,a further ten years until 1977. Why is it,57
NA,"necessary, in the dying hours of a parlia-",57
NA,"ment, to introduce legislation to replace an",57
NA,agreement which will not expire for another,57
NA,six years? I think that the period for which,57
NA,the existing agreement will operate is prob-,57
NA,"ably far too long, in any event, and there is",57
NA,certainly no need to extend the operation,57
NA,of the new agreement for a further ten,57
NA,years beyond the term of the existing one.,57
NA,A good deal of evidence has been pro-,57
NA,"duced, not by Opposition members and",57
NA,"citizens who support the Opposition, but",57
NA,"businessmen, company directors and",57
NA,by the honorable member for New England,57
NA,( Mr Drummond). That evidence indicates,57
NA,that the Government is concerned about,57
NA,the operations of East-West Airlines,57
NA,Limited in New South Wales and is,57
NA,e anxious to have that company come to,57
NA,terms with Ansett-A.N.A. This is the,57
NA,"evidence, not of political opponents of the",57
NA,"Government, but of political supporters of",57
NA,the Government. The Parliament and the,57
NA,people have a right to have the issues pro-,57
NA,a perly tested. Our legitimate move to have,57
NA,"them inquired into has been defeated,",57
NA,the simply because the Government has the,57
NA,"numbers in this Parliament. However, the",57
NA,Government has good reason to believe,57
NA,that it will not have the numbers in the,57
NA,"next Parliament, and it is not sufficiently",57
NA,confident of the validity of its legislation,57
NA,and its own integrity to give the people,57
NA,of Australia an opportunity to judge this,57
NA,but bill. So the Government is opposed to,57
NA,an the amendment proposed by the honorable,57
NA,"member for East Sydney, and, using the",57
NA,"numbers that it has in this committee, will",57
NA,no doubt succeed in having it defeated.,57
NA,"Consequently, it will succeed in depriving",57
NA,a the Australian people of an opportunity,57
NA,was to express their opinion not only on the,57
NA,OppoGovernment's policy towards private air-,57
NA,lines which it has supported and backed,57
NA,"public money right and left, but also",57
NA,"on its attitude to the public airline which,",57
NA,Goby means masquerading in the guise of a,57
NA,"rationalization policy, has been handicapped",57
NA,and hamstrung. If the amendment were,58
NA,"agreed to, the people of Australia would",58
NA,have an opportunity to say how they think,58
NA,the airline industry in this country ought,58
NA,to be conducted.,58
NA,"Is it reasonable to expect that, by some",58
NA,kind of rationalization policy such as we,58
NA,"have seen, greater efficiency can be",58
NA,achieved? The Government relies on com-,58
NA,petition to get efficiency and good results,58
NA,"io this and other fields, so it says, but its",58
NA,policy of rationalization in the airline in-,58
NA,dustry prevents competition. Only yester-,58
NA,"day afternoon, in this chamber, the honor-",58
NA,"able member for Henty ( Mr Fox), who",58
NA,firmly supports the Government and has,58
NA,"voted with it on these issues, showed that",58
NA,the effect of rationalization in this,58
NA,is to ensure that Trans-Australia Airlines,58
NA,is not permitted to do anything that Ansett-,58
NA,A.N.A. cannot do. He told us that when,58
NA,an Ansett-A.N.A. aircraft was prevented,58
NA,by some technical fault from making a,58
NA,scheduled flight T.A.A. was not permitted,58
NA,to make its corresponding flight. Is this,58
NA,real competition? Is this the kind of com-,58
NA,petition that the Government wishes to,58
NA,see established in the airline industry in,58
NA,this or any other country? But the,58
NA,Government is not sufficiently confident of,58
NA,its position in this matter to leave it to the,58
NA,electors to decide. So it rushes into the,58
NA,"House legislation which is not necessary,",58
NA,and which deals with an agreement that,58
NA,does not come to an end for another six,58
NA,years from now. The Government is doing,58
NA,this so that it can give security of operation,58
NA,until 1977 to its friends in Ansett-A.N.A.,58
NA,If it could be sure of getting the numbers-,58
NA,if it were confident that it could rule the,58
NA,Senate after the election-woul d it not in,58
NA,fact put T.A.A. into the hands of the orga-,58
NA,nization which it has really legislated for,58
NA,consistently over the past few years? It,58
NA,is because the Government is afraid of the,58
NA,vote of the Australian people that it has,58
NA,permitted T.A.A. to continue in operation.,58
NA,If it felt confident that it could get away,58
NA,with putting T.A.A. completely into the,58
NA,hands of Mr Ansett and his friends from,58
NA,the United States of America it would do,58
NA,so. But it is not sufficiently confident of,58
NA,its position to accept the amendment moved,58
NA,by the honorable member for East Sydney.,58
NA,It will not allow this legislation to stand,58
NA,"over for decision by the next Parliament,",58
NA,although the agreement with which the,58
NA,legislation deals has another six years to,58
NA,"run. Therefore, I think that not only is",58
NA,the correctness of the Government's policy,58
NA,in relation to airlines in this country at,58
NA,"stake, but the integrity of the Government",58
NA,itself is also at stake in this matter. This,58
NA,is the point raised by the director of East-,58
NA,West Airlines Limited.,58
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! I remind the,58
NA,honorable member that at the moment the,58
NA,committee is considering only clause 2.,58
NA,While various points may be mentioned to,58
NA,illustrate an argument in relation to the,58
NA,amendment and on the question of why it,58
NA,has been moved. I suggest that the honor-,58
NA,able member does not develop his remarks,58
NA,industry into a second-reading speech.,58
Mr CAIRNS , I see the significance of,58
NA,"your ruling, Mr Chairman. But this amend-",58
NA,ment moved by the honorable member for,58
NA,East Sydney goes to the root of the bill and,58
NA,"it involves, therefore, all that the bill in-",58
NA,volves. What we are submitting is that if,58
NA,this amendment is accepted the Parliament,58
NA,and the people will have six mon'.vis in,58
NA,which to consider all these matters ade-,58
NA,quately in a way which is not possible at,58
NA,this stage of a dying Parliament.,58
NA,Mr Ward -An d with the use of the gag.,58
Mr CAIRNS ,"Th e gag, of course, has",58
NA,"been used. At any rate, Mr Chairman, I",58
NA,intend to bring my remarks to a close at,58
NA,this point by saying this: Significant ques-,58
NA,tions have been raised in relation to. first,58
NA,"of all, the agreement which this bill will",58
NA,"extend, but which has still six years to run.",58
NA,We have asked why it is necessary at this,58
NA,stage in 1961 to introduce new legislation in,58
NA,regard to this matter. Is not the answer that,58
NA,the Government has very good reason to,58
NA,think that if it stands the legislation over to,58
NA,be dealt with by the next Parliament it will,58
NA,not have the numbers to put over the kind of,58
NA,"political sham, the kind of political stunt,",58
NA,that is involved in this measure?,58
NA,Mr Clyde Cameron -D o you not know,58
NA,that they are involved in paying the big,58
NA,election expenses of the Government?,58
Mr CAIRNS , 1 do not know where the,58
NA,Government gets it funds for election pur-,58
NA,"poses, but I know that they are most exten-",58
NA,sive. I know also that if I were in the,58
NA,position of Ansett-A.N.A. I would consider,58
NA,it well to my profit to assist the Govern-,59
NA,ment in every way possible in raising funds,59
NA,for its election campaign. I would think,59
NA,that if Mr Ansett and his company do not,59
NA,"know that, then they do not know what is",59
NA,in their interest. But leave that aside. The,59
NA,amendment is designed to give an oppor-,59
NA,tunity to the people to test the integrity,59
NA,of the Government in this matter. The Go-,59
NA,vernment has refused to have an inquiry,59
NA,"to consider this measure, and it has refused",59
NA,to allow this Parliament adequate time for,59
NA,its consideration.,59
Mr HAYLEN ,Parkes) [4.50] - I sup-,59
NA,port the amendment moved by the honor-,59
NA,"able member for East Sydney ( Mr Ward),",59
NA,and for a very good reason. The reason,59
NA,is that to-night we shall conclude our pro-,59
NA,ceedings in this House and go to our,59
NA,masters-th e people-an d that the people,59
NA,are completely confused in regard to this,59
NA,bill. They may or may not support our,59
NA,contention that there are certain aspects,59
NA,of it that need inquiring into. They may,59
NA,or may not support the Government's,59
NA,handling of this measure with all its impli-,59
NA,"cations. But surely if we are a democracy,",59
NA,and if honorable members on the Govern-,59
NA,ment side are not just a collection of,59
NA,"mealy-mouthed, punch-drunk people, we",59
NA,should do the very thing for which the,59
NA,amendment is designed. If we were in,59
NA,the middle of a session there might be,59
NA,some ground for claiming that the Govern-,59
NA,ment has a mandate in this matter. But,59
NA,that cannot be claimed at this stage in,59
NA,"relation to something of this nature, with",59
NA,all its implications. The newspapers have,59
NA,given a great deal of publicity to this,59
NA,"matter, which has caused the public to",59
NA,consider some of its aspects and has also,59
NA,"caused the public, as a result, to be very",59
NA,troubled about the whole thing. In this,59
NA,House the weight of numbers-th e brutal,59
NA,majority-swep t over this side of the,59
NA,House and the whole business was settled,59
NA,"outside in the Liberal caucus, when the",59
NA,Minister wept and the Prime Minister ( Mr.,59
NA,Menzies) took him to his bosom-on e of,59
NA,the greatest sights I should say that will,59
NA,ever be seen in this Parliament. The,59
NA,"matter was judged outside, and then they",59
NA,came in here with the old juggernaut and,59
NA,the steamroller. We know all that. We,59
NA,say what a reasonable amendment this,59
NA,amendment is. If the Government is sin-,59
NA,cere in the way in which it is always,59
NA,declaring its adherence to democracy in,59
NA,"high, loud-sounding voice let it make the",59
NA,"test. Let it say: "" We are going to the",59
NA,people. We will let the voters in all the,59
NA,"electorates make the decision on tbis bill"".",59
NA,"The bill is a highly contentious matter,",59
NA,"as the editorial in the "" Sydney Morning",59
NA,"Herald "" this morning shows. Would not",59
NA,"the man in the street, whom we loosely call",59
NA,"the elector, be alarmed and concerned",59
NA,about this matter? Would not the people,59
NA,who have heard about the bill only because,59
NA,of the significant questions raised in this,59
NA,"Parliament, and because of the things",59
NA,brought to the light of day by the Oppo-,59
NA,"sition, be concerned about it, since they",59
NA,are the people who are going to carry the,59
NA,burden of the new arrangement? Is the,59
NA,amendment not utterly reasonable? It,59
NA,"states in effect that we accept the bill, but",59
NA,will defer the decision on it for six months,59
NA,to a time when tempers will have cooled,59
NA,and judgments will be different.,59
NA,If this challenge is not accepted the Go-,59
NA,"vernment stands condemned, not only for",59
NA,"the bill, which we detest, as well as the",59
NA,"implications behind it, and the things which",59
NA,"have not yet come out, but also for the",59
NA,fact that it prates about democracy. The,59
NA,members on the Government side put them-,59
NA,"selves forward as the bright, shining lights",59
NA,representing all that is good in democracy.,59
NA,"We have the Prime Minister as Sir Gallahad,",59
NA,with all his little knights of the Round,59
NA,"Table, all performing their duties with such",59
NA,clarity and distinction and such honour.,59
NA,"We put it to you, as ordinary people in this",59
NA,"Parliament. We ask you to say: ""Let not",59
NA,"us judge this. Let us take it to-the people.""",59
NA,"It will be a political decision, you may be",59
NA,"sure of that. But beyond that, at this time",59
NA,which is comically called the dying hours,59
NA,"of the Parliament, the punch-drunk Go-",59
NA,vernment is leading the way out of this,59
NA,House. It is going to the people. Here,59
NA,is something highly contentious. We have,59
NA,not the numbers to stop you. Tbe steam-,59
NA,roller runs over us. We have had the gag,59
NA,applied in accordance with the usual pro-,59
NA,cess used by governments to stop debate.,59
NA,But here is an opportunity fairly put to you,59
NA,to do something about this matter in a,59
NA,reasonable way.,59
NA,I think that the Minister for Defence,60
NA,"( Mr Townley), who is now at the table, is",60
NA,"a fair man, and that he is thinking, """,60
NA,"not a bad idea "". The honorable member willy",60
NA,for Perth ( Mr Chaney) laughs at the very,60
NA,idea of letting the people decide this will,60
NA,matter. That is the warning we give you.,60
NA,You are power-drunk and determined to Government.,60
NA,"do these things, and when we suggest to",60
NA,you what is the obviously honest thing to,60
NA,do we get the horse laugh. I think,60
NA,you should have another thought on,60
NA,this matter. I think that if the,60
NA,Minister for Defence followed his own thought.,60
NA,conscience he would accept the amendis,60
NA,ment. Where is there any corner or politiand,60
NA,cal significance in it? The position has,60
NA,been put very concisely by the honorable,60
NA,member for East Sydney. This thing has,60
NA,been hard fought. It has been battled,60
NA,at every stage. We have called for divimeasure,60
NA,sions in order to show our dislike of,60
NA,"measure, and now at the committee stage",60
NA,we have not contested every clause as we,60
NA,"might have done, preferring to concentrate",60
NA,on this part of the bill. Are we to say,60
NA,this is the end of our fight? Is this the Australia.,60
NA,"end, after all that the newspapers have said,",60
NA,after all that general opinion has conjured,60
NA,"out of this matter, and after a man of",60
NA,dignity and bearing in this House-a,60
NA,of a different political party from ours-,60
NA,has felt emboldened or obliged to stand,60
NA,in the Parliament and deny what the,60
NA,ter said? Is not all that big enough to,60
NA,"rant some inquiry, or at least some more",60
NA,consideration here of what this side is,60
NA,ing at the moment? This is the last opporI,60
NA,tunity we shall have to give you the chance,60
NA,to live up to your loud-mouthed declarathe,60
NA,"tions regarding democracy,",60
NA,"r,",60
NA,- '^conclude by reminding the Government,60
NA,s,60
NA,"that we are going to the people, to our",60
NA,masters. They will judge us on this and,60
NA,"many other things, but if you take the",60
NA,coward's way out and roll this measure,60
NA,through the House to-night by juggernaut,60
NA,"and steamroller, there will be a greater",60
NA,in the mind of the people than there would,60
NA,"be if you were honest and fair and said, "" We",60
NA,will accept this amendment and lay this bill,60
NA,"aside for six months"". The essence of",60
NA,democracy is that you cannot bind your,60
NA,successors in this Parliament; but that is,60
NA,very thing the Government is trying to,60
NA,That is how the people will look at it,60
NA,have to get rid of this proposition at this,60
NA,late hour in the life of the Twenty-third Par-,60
NA,It is liament by putting the measure through,60
NA,nilly. 1 plead with the Minister to accept,60
NA,the amendment. If he does so the people,60
NA,at least think there is some little spark,60
NA,of the vitality of democracy left in the,60
NA,Mr Clyde Cameron -I t is the slush fund,60
NA,that that is making them go on with it.,60
Mr HAYLEN ,Th e honorable member,60
NA,for Hindmarsh always has a penetrating,60
NA,He tells me it is the slush fund that,60
NA,responsible. Whatever lamps are burning,60
NA,"whatever oil lights them, I think we",60
NA,should make our declaration purely on the,60
NA,democratic attitude that has been taken by,60
NA,the honorable member for East Sydney.,60
NA,out Give us an opportunity to consider this,60
NA,later. Lay it aside until there is a,60
NA,the new Parliament. Answer the voice of the,60
NA,people and of democracy by not rushing the,60
NA,bill through in terror and in hiding and in,60
NA,some urgency from your masters who in this,60
NA,that case certainly are not the people of,60
Mr TOWNLEY ,Denison-Ministe r for,60
NA,great Defence) [4.57] -Th e honorable member,60
NA,man for Parkes ( Mr Haylen) has made what,60
NA,"seemed to be a reasonable and, in one sense,",60
NA,up a generous suggestion that we accept the,60
NA,Minisamendment of the honorable member for,60
NA,warEast Sydney ( Mr Ward). 1 say that he,60
NA,appeared to be reasonable and generous.,60
NA,"arguHe said that if I had my way, he was sure",60
NA,"would accept the amendment, and that sort",60
NA,"of 'thing. In introducing the amendment,",60
NA,honorable member for East Sydney,60
NA,said there was no urgency about the matter,60
NA,at all. He said it could be done at any,60
NA,"time. No, Mr Chairman, as the honorable",60
NA,"member for Parkes made his speech, he",60
NA,spoke in a most persuasive way. It is only,60
NA,when you examine the facts of this matter,60
NA,that you see that the honorable member for,60
NA,"Parkes too would get this bill, if he could,",60
NA,into the political atmo.phere that has sur-,60
NA,doubt rounded it in the past few days.,60
NA,I would have been far more inclined to,60
NA,"consider, and perhaps accept, the amendment",60
NA,that has been put up by the honorable mem-,60
NA,ber for East Sydney if it had come when he,60
NA,the spoke on this bill several days ago. I want,60
NA,do. to pay the honorable member for East,60
NA,if you Sydney a compliment. These bills were,60
NA,"introduced first in the Senate, and when I",61
NA,brought them down in this place there were,61
NA,three of them. We agreed to take them,61
NA,together. The honorable member for East,61
NA,Sydney took the adjournment of the debate,61
NA,on each of the bills. When he came to,61
NA,"speak on the Airlines Agreements Bill, he",61
NA,stuck to the bill right through almost to the,61
NA,"finish. With great respect to the Chair, he",61
NA,and the honorable member for Farrer ( Mr.,61
NA,Fairbairn) were about the only two honor-,61
NA,able members who confined their remarks to,61
NA,the bills.,61
NA,"Now, after the discussion on this bill has",61
NA,gone off at a tangent and become mixed up,61
NA,"with East-West Airlines, Mr Shand and",61
NA,NA,61
NA,"New England ( Mr Drummond), we come",61
NA,at this late hour to an amendment. If there,61
NA,"was anything genuine in this amendment,",61
NA,surely we could have expected that it would,61
NA,"be put up at the correct time, when the",61
NA,honorable member for East Sydney was,61
NA,speaking. If consideration of it has been,61
NA,left so late as honorable members opposite,61
NA,"suggest, the fault lies with the Opposition.",61
NA,The honorable member for East Sydney,61
NA,suggested that there was no urgency about,61
NA,this matter. I direct attention to the first,61
NA,paragraph of my second-reading speech to,61
NA,this effect-,61
NA,The purpose of the Airlines Agreements BiU is,61
NA,to give effect to and obtain parliamentary approval,61
NA,"for an agreement between the Commonwealth, the",61
NA,"Australian National Airlines Commission, Ansett",61
NA,Transport Industries Limited and Australian,61
NA,National Airways Proprietary Limited.,61
NA,I direct attention also to the next sentence-,61
NA,The agreement has been executed by all the,61
NA,"parties, including the commission, but does not",61
NA,come into force until it is approved by the,61
NA,ment.,61
NA,Nobody should try to tell me that the,61
NA,Australian National Airlines Commission-,61
NA,"that is, T.A.A -ha s been pushed round by",61
NA,"the Minister for Civil Aviation, because",61
NA,too many people in this place know the,61
NA,calibre and capacity of the men who form,61
NA,"that commission. Sir Giles Chippindal-1,",61
NA,"for one, is a man whose reputation is second",61
NA,to none as an administrator and great,61
NA,public servant. The honorable member for,61
NA,Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) appears,61
NA,to object to that statement. Let us leave,61
NA,the Australian National Airlines Commis-,61
NA,sion and T.A.A. There has been a second,61
NA,agreement by Ansett-A.N.A. The man,61
NA,"who is a director of that company, who took",61
NA,part in and agreed to these negotiations,61
NA,and who is waiting for this measure to,61
NA,"go through the House, is none other than",61
NA,the endorsed Labour Party candidate for,61
NA,the electorate of Henty.,61
NA,Mr Allan Fraser -Wha t does that,61
NA,prove?,61
Mr TOWNLEY,I t proves that the,61
NA,people interested in this amendment-,61
NA,T.A.A. and Ansett-A.N.A. supported by an,61
NA,endorsed Labour Party candidate-wan t,61
NA,this legislation to go through. There is,61
NA,urgency in it. There is a second considera-,61
NA,tion also. This bill and the other bills,61
NA,envisage the introduction of jet aircraft to,61
NA,the airlines of Australia. It is specifically,61
NA,mentioned that they will not be in use,61
NA,before 1964 and both companies will intro-,61
NA,duce their jets at the same time because it,61
NA,takes that time for the Department of Civil,61
NA,Aviation to provide for air traffic control,61
NA,and the rest of it. But anybody who knows,61
NA,the airlines industry knows that if you want,61
NA,"jets here by the end of 1964, there will",61
NA,be an urgency for the selection of these,61
NA,aircraft and the placing of an order.,61
NA,Otherwise we will be at the end of the line,61
NA,and will not get them for years and years.,61
NA,That applies to both the airline companies.,61
NA,"An enormofis-""amount of nonsense has",61
NA,been spoken injtfa'is debate that has nothing,61
NA,to do with the'bilj^. themselves. State-,61
NA,ments have been -riiade by persons who,61
NA,simply do not understand the airlines indus-,61
NA,try. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition,61
NA,( Mr Whitlam) to-day made some com-,61
NA,ments about the subsidy that was paid to,61
NA,ParliaEast-West Airlines and he pointed out,61
NA,that double the amount of that subsidy,61
NA,was paid to the Ansett subsidiary.,61
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! I remind,61
NA,the Minister that as the committee is deal-,61
NA,ing with clause 2 he will not be in order,61
NA,in referring to matters debated on the,61
NA,second reading that are not related to the,61
NA,clause under discussion.,61
Mr TOWNLEY ,Th e honorable mem-,61
NA,ber for East Sydney said there was no,61
NA,urgency.,61
The CHAIRMAN , I also called the,61

NA,Clause agreed t o .,62
NA,Clause 3-,62
NA,3. The title of the Principal Act is repealed and,62
NA,the following title inserted in its stead:-,62
NA,""" An Act to approve certain Agreements relating",62
NA,"to Air Transport, and for purposes connected",62
NA,"therewith."".",62
Mr WARD ,East Sydney) [5.15] -A s I,63
NA,am of the opinion that this clause does not,63
NA,"describe adequately the contents of the bill,",63
NA,I move-,63
NA,"Omit all words after "" Agreements "", insert",63
NA,give an unfair advantage to Ansett Transport,63
NA,"Industries "".",63
NA,1 think that would be a much more satisreceive,63
NA,"factory title for the bill, because there",63
NA,be no doubt that that is what is proposed,63
NA,this legislation. My proposed amendment,63
NA,wide enough to give any honorable member,63
NA,of the Opposition who was prevented by,63
NA,the gag from expressing his views during,63
NA,the second reading of the bill an oppor-,63
NA,tunity to direct attention to the many,63
NA,"advantages which, for some undisclosed",63
NA,"reason, this anti-Labour government proanother",63
NA,poses to give to this private business,63
NA,organization.,63
NA,Let us examine some of the things which,63
NA,"the bill proposes to do. First, as some",63
NA,"speakers have pointed out already, it",63
NA,poses to extend for another ten years to,63
NA,1977 an agreement which still has six years,63
NA,to run. There is no reason why that agreescheme.,63
NA,ment should be extended immediately.,63
NA,Minister said that the reason for the urgency,63
NA,of this legislation was that the two airlines,63
NA,had to consider the question of re-equipT.A.A.,63
NA,ment. He said that they had to consider,63
NA,"new types of aircraft, and that they would",63
NA,be required to place orders by a certain,63
NA,time if they were to avoid long delays in,63
NA,delivery. How he can conscientiously put,63
NA,forward such an argument is beyond my,63
NA,"understanding because, if he reads the",63
NA,agreement which this Parliament is asked,63
NA,"to accept, he will see that neither company",63
NA,is to be permitted even to apply for,63
NA,licence to purchase new aircraft until,63
NA,"November, 1962. These airlines do not",63
NA,wait until they are placing the order before,63
NA,deciding what type of aircraft they want.,63
NA,I should imagine that types of aircraft,63
NA,suitable for re-equipment would be Ansett,63
NA,receiving the attention of the airline combeen,63
NA,panies continuously. The bill is introduced,63
NA,now because the Government docs not want,63
NA,"Trans-Australia Airlines, which already",63
NA,"sufficient reserves to buy turbo-jet aircraft,",63
NA,to be at any advantage. By way of interthat,63
NA,"jection, the Minister said to me across the",63
NA,table that the money would not be imme-,63
NA,diately available to Ansett-A.N.A. It is,63
NA,"available to T.A.A., but it is not available",63
NA,to the Ansett transport group. Evidently,63
NA,it will take some time for the Ansett group,63
NA,"to raise the money. Therefore, T.A.A. is",63
NA,not to be permitted to place orders for,63
NA,""" To turbo-jet aircraft because that would give an",63
NA,advantage to the government airline over,63
NA,the privately owned airline in that it would,63
NA,"prior delivery of the aircraft. Then,",63
NA,"can after the order has been fulfilled, the air-",63
NA,by lines are not to be permitted to operate the,63
NA,"is turbo-jet aircraft, even if they are already",63
NA,"delivered, until 1st July, 1964. In those",63
NA,"circumstances, how can anybody argue that",63
NA,there is any urgent need for this legislation?,63
NA,This bill will be of great advantage to,63
NA,Ansett-A.N.A. When we are dealing with,63
NA,"clause, 1 shall have something to",63
NA,say about the advantage this organization,63
NA,will enjoy in shutting out other competitors,63
NA,from interstate air routes and in crushing,63
NA,its competitors in the intra-state services.,63
NA,We all know of the great advantages which,63
NA,prothe Ansett Transport group has enjoyed,63
NA,under what is known as the rationalization,63
NA,"In effect, this rationalization",63
NA,The scheme is a scheme designed to crush,63
NA,competition with the Ansett Transport group,63
NA,"because, in fair, honest, open competition,",63
NA,must succeed to a much greater,63
NA,extent than it has been permitted to do up,63
NA,"to date. I repeat, the rationalization scheme",63
NA,is designed to crush competition and to,63
NA,"give an advantage to a great, private mono-",63
NA,polistic concern which is now reaching out,63
NA,for control of all the intra-state services.,63
NA,Any one who cares to read the report,63
NA,published recently by the Minister for Civil,63
NA,a Aviation (Senator Paltridge) will see de-,63
NA,18th tailed in it the matters which have been,63
NA,dealt with by the rationalization committee.,63
NA,He will also discover that in all major,63
NA,matters every request of T.A.A. has been,63
NA,rejected whilst every request made by the,63
NA,Transport group has sooner or later,63
NA,"acceded to. It is obvious, therefore,",63
NA,that the purpose of the rationalization com-,63
NA,mittee is to tie up T.A.A. and restrict the,63
NA,has development of that organization.,63
NA,What is the use of the Minister saying,63
NA,both the Australian National Airlines,63
NA,Commission and the Ansett-A.N.A. group,63
NA,agreed to this proposal? This is a shotgun,63
NA,"wedding, if ever there was one. What",63
NA,opportunity has the commission of resisting,63
NA,the Government when it gets the tip from,64
NA,the Minister for Civil Aviation that this,64
NA,sort of thing has got to go through? I have,64
NA,already mentioned the question of re-,64
NA,"equipment and stated that where, normally,",64
NA,the advantage should go to the government,64
NA,airline - Trans-Australia Airlines - that,64
NA,organization is being prevented from acting,64
NA,until such time as Ansett-A.N.A. is ready,64
NA,to re-equip with turbo-jet aircraft.,64
NA,I turn now to the question of finance.,64
NA,Although each airline is supposed to be,64
NA,enabled to place orders for only two of,64
NA,"these aircraft at the end of next year, this",64
NA,Government proposes to guarantee loans,64
NA,for Ansett-A.N.A. to an amount of,64
NA,"£6,000,000. If Ansett-A.N.A. cannot obtain",64
NA,the money on the commercial market at a,64
NA,"reasonable rate of interest, the Government",64
NA,undertakes to provide the money needed.,64
NA,When we talk about wanting additional,64
NA,"money for housing, or for the re-employment",64
NA,"of Australian workers, we are told that",64
NA,there is no money available. Now we find,64
NA,that if Ansett-A.N.A. cannot raise on the,64
NA,commercial market the money it requires to,64
NA,"purchase two turbo-jet aircraft, the Govern-",64
NA,ment will guarantee loans to the tune of,64
NA,"£6,000,000. Why is the amount of",64
NA,"£6,000,000 being guaranteed? These aircraft",64
NA,"cost between £1,200,000 and £2,000,000,",64
NA,depending on the type purchased. If the,64
NA,Ansett Transport group purchases its two,64
NA,"aircraft at the highest figure, it will still",64
NA,"have £2,000,000 to spare. Why is this group",64
NA,"to be guaranteed 50 per cent, above the",64
NA,figure needed to buy these aircraft?,64
NA,I turn now to another advantage to be,64
NA,enjoyed by this private airline. I refer to,64
NA,air navigation charges and the aviation fuel,64
NA,tax. This Government gave the Ansett,64
NA,group an undertaking that the last Budget,64
NA,would contain no proposal to increases in,64
NA,navigation charges. Ansett-A.N.A. sought,64
NA,"that undertaking, and it was given by the",64
NA,"Government, despite the fact that the",64
NA,Government's declared policy is to obtain,64
NA,full recoupment of all public moneys ex-,64
NA,pended on providing airport facilties in,64
NA,Australia. An examination of the figures,64
NA,will disclose that the Government spends,64
NA,on aviation services millions upon millions,64
NA,of pounds in excess of the revenue it derives,64
NA,from air navigation charges and aviation,64
NA,fuel tax. How many years will it take,64
NA,to attain full recoupment of public moneys,64
NA,spent on airport facilities under a scheme,64
NA,"such as this, which restricts the taxing",64
NA,"powers of Parliament and prevents not one,",64
NA,"but all, Parliaments in the next sixteen years",64
NA,from increasing air navigation charges by,64
NA,"more than 10 per cent, in any one year?",64
NA,"Last year, the revenue derived by the",64
NA,Government from air navigation charges,64
NA,"amounted to a little less than £1,400,000.",64
NA,"The proposed increase of 10 per cent, for",64
NA,"next year will mean only £140,000- a",64
NA,mere bagatelle when compared to the many,64
NA,millions of pounds being spent on provid-,64
NA,ing facilities at airports. Who will gain,64
NA,the advantage here? Certainly it will not,64
NA,"be Trans-Australia Airlines, because that",64
NA,organization has been able to build up,64
NA,"ample reserves, in addition to making a",64
NA,reasonable return on money invested.,64
NA,"Therefore, it requires no assistance.",64
NA,"I come now to freights, and here we find",64
NA,what is perhaps the greatest contradiction,64
NA,of all in the Government's argument about,64
NA,rationalization. The Government says that,64
NA,the rationalization scheme is designed to,64
NA,"equalize the capacity of aircraft, to ensure",64
NA,that all aircraft are equal in quality and,64
NA,that there shall be an equitable arrangement,64
NA,of air routes. It says also that the com-,64
NA,mittee shall draw up a scale of fares.,64
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The honor-,64
NA,able member's time has expired.,64
Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,Hindmarsh),64
NA,[5.25] - I support the amendment. There,64
NA,is no doubt whatever that it ought to be,64
NA,carried. That will be admitted by any,64
NA,one who cares to make so much as a,64
NA,cursory examination of the schedule that,64
NA,sets out the terms of the agreement. The,64
NA,provision about which I am particularly,64
NA,concerned seeks to tie the hands of future,64
NA,governments until 1977 and restrain them,64
NA,from using the taxing powers of the Par-,64
NA,liament in the way that they may consider,64
NA,to be proper at the time. It will be a,64
NA,sorry day for democracy if a government,64
NA,that is about to go out of office has the,64
NA,"right to tell future parliaments, yet to",64
NA,"be elected, for another fifteen years that",64
NA,they shall not use their taxing powers in,64
NA,respect of this or some other matter. If,64
NA,it is constitutional for this Government to,64
NA,lay down what future governments for the,64
NA,next fifteen years will do in the field of,64
NA,"taxation, there is nothing to stop it from",65
NA,making the period 150 years. The time,65
NA,would not matter. The only principle,65
NA,involved is whether one parliament has the,65
NA,right to bind a future parliament in the,65
NA,field of taxation. If it is held to be con-,65
NA,stitutional that this Parliament has the,65
NA,right to bind the hands of parliaments yet,65
NA,"unelected-th e next five parliaments, as",65
NA,my honorable member for East Sydney,65
NA,reminds me-ther e cannot possibly be,65
NA,anything in the law to stop any parliament,65
NA,"from binding the hands of the next ten,",65
NA,twenty or 100 parliaments.,65
NA,I am not competent to express an,65
NA,opinion on constitutional law. It is not,65
NA,"my own personal opinion, but the opinion",65
NA,of men who are competent to express an,65
NA,"opinion on constitutional law, that this",65
NA,of the agreement is invalid. It cannot,65
NA,"possibly be given effect. I hope that, as",65
NA,"a member of the Parliament, I shall one",65
NA,day have the opportunity to disown com-,65
NA,pletely the provision of the agreement,65
NA,which seeks to prevent future parliaments,65
NA,from imposing taxation as they may think,65
NA,"proper. It is entirely wrong, moreover,",65
NA,that any parliament should have the right,65
NA,to bind future parliaments. In this,65
NA,"instance, it is for fifteen years, but once",65
NA,the principle is accepted there can be no,65
NA,limit to the period. It might be 100 years;,65
NA,and nothing could be done about it. This,65
NA,agreement is so lop-sided in favour of,65
NA,Ansett-A.N.A. that we are entitled to ask,65
NA,whether there is any truth in the strong,65
NA,rumour going around that Ansett's have,65
NA,paid substantial sums into the Liberal Party,65
NA,slush fund to meet its election expenses.,65
NA,Mr Townley - I take objection to that,65
NA,remark and ask that it be withdrawn.,65
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! I ask the do,65
NA,honorable member to withdraw the remark.,65
Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,"No , I will first",65
NA,"not withdraw it and I say to you, Mr in",65
NA,"Chairman, that you cannot require me to",65
NA,withdraw the remark that Ansett's have,65
NA,paid substantial sums of money into the,65
NA,slush fund of the Liberal Party. The,65
NA,Liberal Party has no protection in,65
NA,Parliament any more than has the Labour,65
NA,"Party, as we have learned to our sorrow",65
NA,when night after night in the debate on,65
NA,"motion for the adjournment of the House,",65
NA,honorable members opposite make scurri-,65
NA,lous attacks on the Labour Party. The,65
NA,Liberal Party has absolutely no protection,65
NA,"in this Parliament, Mr Chairman, and I",65
NA,ask for your ruling on that.,65
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The Minis-,65
NA,ter has taken exception to a certain remark,65
NA,made by the honorable membsr for,65
NA,Hindmarsh.,65
NA,Mr Ward -A s reflecting on whom?,65
NA,"Mr Townley -O n myself, as a mtm-",65
NA,ber of the Liberal Party.,65
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! It has been,65
NA,the practice in the House and in the com-,65
NA,"mittee, in certain circumstances, that when",65
NA,part remarks are made by an honorable mem-,65
NA,"ber, and objection is taken by a member",65
NA,"of another party, the member who makes",65
NA,the remarks is asked to withdraw them. I,65
NA,have asked the honorable member to,65
NA,withdraw the remark that he made. My,65
NA,"ruling is that, as the remark was a genera-",65
NA,"lization, if the honorable member is not",65
NA,prepared to withdraw it the Chair cannot,65
NA,enforce its request for a withdrawal. How-,65
NA,"ever, in the circumstances, as the Minister",65
NA,"requests a withdrawal, 1 ask again that",65
NA,the honorable member for Hindmarsh,65
NA,withdraw the remark.,65
Mr CLYDE CAMERON , I appreciate,65
NA,"your approach to this matter, Mr Chair-",65
NA,"man. You have been very moderate, and",65
NA,it is with a heavy heart that I have to re-,65
NA,"fuse your very reasonable, moderately put",65
NA,"request. I regret that I cannot withdraw,",65
NA,because of the way in which Government,65
NA,supporters have repeatedly attacked our,65
NA,party in the same manner. If it had not,65
NA,become the fashion in this Parliament to,65
NA,"this kind of thing, I would be the first",65
NA,"to bow to your wishes. Indeed, I would",65
NA,not even have made the suggestion in the,65
NA,place. But it seems to be the fashion,65
NA,this place to cast all kinds of aspersions,65
NA,on political parties to which members be-,65
NA,"long, and nothing is done about it.",65
NA,"To pursue what I was saying, there are",65
NA,persistent rumours going round that the,65
NA,this Liberal Party is receiving enormous,65
NA,assistance in contributions to its slush,65
NA,fund from Ansett-A.N.A. It has also,65
NA,the been rumoured that Ansett-A.N.A. has told,65
NA,the Liberal Party that it can book tele-,66
NA,vision advertising and advertising in news-,66
NA,papers and render the account to Ansett-,66
NA,"A.N.A., so that not only will the account",66
NA,be paid by Ansett but also Ansett will be,66
NA,able to claim a deduction in respect of it,66
NA,for income tax purposes. A lot of it will,66
NA,be rebated in tax.,66
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! I suggest,66
NA,that the honorable member keep to the,66
NA,bill and the amendment moved by the,66
NA,honorable member for East Sydney.,66
Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,On e of the,66
NA,provisions that I think is completely objec-,66
NA,tionable is the manner in which the agree-,66
NA,ment prevents Trans-Australia Airlines,66
NA,from really competing with Ansett-A.N.A.,66
NA,in the way in which these so-called stal-,66
NA,warts of private enterprise pretend to,66
NA,believe. T.A.A. will not be allowed to alter,66
NA,"its schedules, engage in new routes, reduce",66
NA,"its freight charges, or reduce its passenger",66
NA,"charges, without the permission of Ansett-",66
NA,A.N.A. We know that if T.A.A. were free,66
NA,"to operate schedules as it desired, if",66
NA,it were free to operate on all the,66
NA,routes on which it would like to,66
NA,"operate, and if it were free to fix",66
NA,"its, own fares, then and only then would",66
NA,we have competition in the real sense of,66
NA,the word. Already T.A.A. is paying the,66
NA,"same taxes upon the fuel that it uses, it is",66
NA,paying the same taxes on the parts that,66
NA,"are required for its aircraft, and it is",66
NA,ing the same landing charges as are paid,66
NA,by Ansett-A.N.A. It is compelled to pay,66
NA,to the Treasury interest on the money that,66
NA,it borrowed from the Treasury in the first,66
NA,place. So in every commercial sense T.A.A.,66
NA,is being compelled to meet the same,66
NA,requirements as Ansett-A.N.A. is com-,66
NA,pelled to meet.,66
NA,T.A.A. should be free to fix its,66
NA,and to use its initiative in the purchase of,66
NA,the best aircraft available. It has shown,66
NA,its ability to do this on three occasions.,66
NA,"First, it beat A.N.A. in the purchase of",66
NA,Convair aircraft. T.A.A. had a tremendous,66
NA,advantage over A.N.A. simply because,66
NA,T.A.A. technicians and engineers showed,66
NA,greater initiative and greater foresight.,66
NA,also showed to great advantage when they,66
NA,"selected the Viscount semi-jet aircraft,",66
NA,"which operate on kerosene, fly at a greater",66
NA,"speed and a higher altitude, and are more",66
NA,comfortable than the aircraft which the,66
NA,"private airline had. Then the Government,",66
NA,in order to see that T.A.A. did not get the,66
NA,real advantage that the operation of kero-,66
NA,"sene-burning aircraft would have given,",66
NA,imposed a tax on aviation kerosene which,66
NA,"cost T.A.A. an extra £300,000 a year.",66
NA,"Then, T.A.A. secured an option to buy",66
NA,Caravelle aircraft. This was the third,66
NA,occasion on which a T.A.A. decision would,66
NA,have given it a distinct advantage over,66
NA,Ansett-A.N.A.,66
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The honor-,66
NA,able member's time has expired.,66
Mr CAIRNS ,Yarra) [5.35] - Mr Chair-,66
NA,"man, as the time of the honorable member",66
NA,for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) has,66
NA,expired without his completing his most,66
NA,"important submissions to the committee, I",66
NA,would like to take up where he left off.,66
NA,"T.A.A., through the skill and anticipation of",66
NA,"its engineers, selected Caravelle aircraft to",66
NA,"fly in this country. Of course, the posses-",66
NA,sion of those aircraft would have given an,66
NA,advantage as was recognized by all con-,66
NA,"cerned in the industry. For some reason,",66
NA,no doubt connected with the internal financ-,66
NA,"ing of Ansett-A.N.A., that company had",66
NA,decided to purchase Electra aircraft from,66
NA,"the United States of America, although the",66
NA,Electras were more expensive to buy and to,66
NA,"run, and were not so attractive to the flying",66
NA,pay- public. So the Government saw to it that,66
NA,T.A.A. was not permitted to proceed with,66
NA,its arrangement to buy Caravelle aircraft.,66
NA,"Not only did the Government take this step,",66
NA,but it also saw to it that T.A.A. was required,66
NA,to purchase the very aircraft-th e Electras,66
NA,-whic h it had passed over in the first place.,66
NA,This ensured that Ansett-A.N.A. would be,66
NA,protected in the operation of its aircraft. It,66
NA,was also no accident that Ansett-A.N.A. got,66
NA,own fares first delivery of the Electras.,66
NA,Because of intelligent anticipation and,66
NA,"skilful planning, T.A.A. was far better",66
NA,equipped than Ansett-A.N.A. It had a,66
NA,"larger number of Viscounts, the most effec-",66
NA,tive aircraft to fly in Australia up to that,66
NA,"time. Ansett-A.N.A., because of its inability",66
NA,"to attract capital, even with all the protec-",66
NA,This ion and assistance that the Government had,66
NA,"given over the years, was encumbered by a",66
NA,"number of old aircraft, DC4's and DC6's,",66
NA,which could not compete with Viscounts. So,66
NA,an arrangement was made under which,67
NA,T.A.A. was required to hand over to Ansett-,67
NA,"A.N.A. three Viscounts, the best aircraft",67
NA,"then flying in Australia, in exchange for two",67
NA,DC6's. Every time I fly in a DC6 I think,67
NA,I am flying in a chaffcutter. One has only to,67
NA,fly in a Viscount and a DC6 to know which,67
NA,is the better aircraft. Tbe claim that three,67
NA,Viscounts were equal in value to two DC6's,67
NA,has only to be stated for us to know the,67
NA,extent to which this Government is pre-,67
NA,pared to go out of its way to assist Ansett-,67
NA,"A.N.A. So, the amendment moved by the",67
NA,honorable member for East Sydney ( Mr.,67
NA,Ward) becomes completely relevant. This,67
NA,"principal act, when amended by this bill, will",67
NA,not be as stated in clause 3-,67
NA,An Act to approve certain Agreements relating,67
NA,"to Air Transport, and for purposes connected",67
NA,therewith.,67
NA,As the amendment moved by the honorable,67
NA,member for East Sydney justifiably indi-,67
NA,"cates, it will be an act "" to give an unfair",67
NA,"advantage to Ansett Transport Industries "".",67
NA,This measure is designed to continue the,67
NA,policy that has prevailed over the last six,67
NA,or seven years of giving an unfair advantage,67
NA,to Ansett-A.N.A. This policy first became,67
NA,"apparent when T.A.A., by its own business",67
NA,"acumen, put itself ahead by purchasing",67
NA,Viscount aircraft. The Government's re-,67
NA,action was to impose a tax on kerosene fuel,67
NA,that the Viscounts used so as to take away,67
NA,the advantage that T.A.A. had been able to,67
NA,achieve. Then there was the compulsory,67
NA,"exchange of Viscounts for DC6's, but",67
NA,T.A.A. has been able to take advantage of,67
NA,that deal. It has been able to run the,67
NA,DC6's in its New Guinea service and by,67
NA,this means has endeavoured to get back,67
NA,some of the losses forced upon it by the,67
NA,Government. The situation now is that we,67
NA,have good reason to believe that Ansett-,67
NA,A.N.A. with the backing of the Government,67
NA,is proceeding on a plan which will continue,67
NA,over the next ten or fifteen years in two,67
NA,stages.,67
NA,The first stage of the plan is for,67
NA,A.N.A. to take over all intra-state airlines,67
NA,in Australia. The Minister for Civil AviaCaravelles.,67
NA,tion (Senator Paltridge) has assisted this,67
NA,move by putting pressure on East-West,67
NA,lines Limited to sell out to Ansett-A.N.A.,67
NA,Once the intra-state airlines have been taken,67
NA,over-an d that is the purpose of this bill-,67
NA,the Government will then proceed to the,67
NA,second stage of the plan. The second stage,67
NA,is the taking over of T.A.A. by Ansett-,67
NA,"A.N.A. which, by that time, will be con-",67
NA,trolled by American interests. That is the,67
NA,blueprint for the development of Australians,67
NA,"airlines. That is the Government's plan,",67
NA,"and so we have moved this amendment, the",67
NA,effect of which would be to call the princi-,67
NA,"pal act "" An Act to approve certain Agree-",67
NA,ments to give an unfair advantage to Ansett,67
NA,"Transport Industries "". That is the aim of",67
NA,the bill and it should be clearly stated. I,67
NA,support the amendment.,67
Mr CHANEY ,Perth) [5.40] -Thes e,67
NA,proceedings are being broadcast and three,67
NA,or four members of the Opposition are play-,67
NA,ing a very shrewd political game. Their,67
NA,aim is to keep on talking until the debate is,67
NA,gagged. They will then say that they have,67
NA,"been prevented from speaking, hoping of",67
NA,course that any one listening will get the,67
NA,idea that a grave injustice is being done.,67
NA,The honorable member for Yarra ( Mr.,67
NA,Cairns) made statements which have no,67
NA,basis of truth.,67
NA,Mr Cairns -Disprov e them!,67
Mr CHANEY ,Al l right. The honor-,67
NA,able member said that T.A.A. had been,67
NA,forced to hand over three Viscounts for,67
NA,two chaff-cutter DC6's and that the Vis-,67
NA,counts were highly valuable modern air-,67
NA,craft. In fact they were Viscount 720's,67
NA,which were nowhere near modern. I think,67
NA,"that they included "" TVA "" and "" TVB "",",67
NA,the first two Viscounts that T.A.A. got.,67
NA,There is in the world to-day a market for,67
NA,second-hand aircraft and there is a demand,67
NA,for second-hand DC6's. Their value is,67
NA,much greater than that of a second-hand,67
NA,Viscount. I doubt whether you could sell,67
NA,a second-hand Viscount 720 on the world,67
NA,second-hand market.,67
NA,"These are facts, but the Opposition will",67
NA,not admit them. Just because somebody,67
NA,gets up and puts an opposing view and,67
NA,"states a fact or two, Ihe Opposition gets",67
NA,Ansettannoyed. Honorable members opposite,67
NA,say that T.A.A. was stopped from buying,67
NA,Let us have a look at the record,67
NA,of the Caravelles. The Caravelles operating,67
NA,Airon the airlines of the world to-day are,67
NA,Mark 14's and the ones that Trans-Aus-,67
NA,tralia Airlines wanted to order at one time,67
NA,"were Mark l's. At that stage, even if",67
NA,Caravelles had been suitable for Australian,67
NA,conditions and Trans-Australia Airlines had,68
NA,"got them, they would not have complied",68
NA,with civil aviation requirements relating to,68
NA,flying aids and other things. All these,68
NA,things were taken into account but mem-,68
NA,bers opposite go on ad nauseam. I think,68
NA,that occasionally we should have a few,68
NA,facts.,68
Mr COPE ,Watson) [5.43] -I t seems a,68
NA,remarkable thing that the honorable mem-,68
NA,ber for Perth ( Mr Chaney) has no faith,68
NA,in the past leader of Trans-Australia Air-,68
NA,"lines, the man that this Government has",68
NA,just appointed as chairman of the Com-,68
NA,monwealth Banking Corporation. This,68
NA,man acted on the advice of all his experts,68
NA,in Trans-Australia Airlines after very care-,68
NA,ful consideration-the y had travelled,68
NA,throughout the world-an d came to a wise,68
NA,decision. He chose French Caravelle air-,68
NA,craft with Rolls-Royce engines. I venture,68
NA,to say that there are very few members in,68
NA,this House who do not feel safe when they,68
NA,look out of the window of an aircraft and,68
NA,"see "" R.R."" on the engines. They know",68
NA,that they are the best engines in the world.,68
NA,These aircraft were selected by the Trans-,68
NA,"Australia Airlines experts, who gave advice",68
NA,to Mr Warren MCDonald.,68
NA,The point is-an d I say this deliberately,68
NA,-tha t there is no doubt that some negotia-,68
NA,tion is going on as a result of which this,68
NA,Government gives preference to United,68
NA,States factories and commercial interests,68
NA,over the industries of other countries. Let,68
NA,us look at the matter in its true perspective.,68
NA,We have an eight-to-one favorable trade,68
NA,"balance with France, where the Caravelles",68
NA,are manufactured. We have an adverse,68
NA,trade balance of two to one with the,68
NA,U.S.A. Besides this there is always the,68
NA,"dollar difficulty to consider, whereas there",68
NA,are no sterling difficulties connected with,68
NA,trade with France. Yet the Government,68
NA,buys these aircraft from the U.S.A.,68
NA,Does not this show that the Government is,68
NA,"favouring the U.S.A., when it purchases",68
NA,aircraft from that country which are not the,68
NA,best available?,68
NA,I defy any honorable member on the Go-,68
NA,vernment side to dispute the advice that,68
NA,was given to Mr Warren MCDonald by the,68
NA,experts of T.A.A. Is there any honorable,68
NA,member opposite who doubts the veracity,68
NA,or the great ability of Mr Warren,68
NA,MCDonald? I do not think there is. The,68
NA,argument of the honorable member for,68
NA,Perth is too silly for words.,68
Mr BRYANT ,Wills) [5.46] -Th e,68
NA,"honorable member for Perth ( Mr Chaney),",68
NA,who seems to have assumed the role of,68
NA,spokesman for Ansett Transport Industries,68
NA,Limited and for the Minister for Civil,68
NA,Aviation (Senator Paltridge) might well tell,68
NA,us who it was who initiated the cross-,68
NA,"charter arrangement. This is, I think,",68
NA,fundamental to the question. If Trans-,68
NA,Australia Airlines wanted these DC6B air-,68
NA,"craft, then I suppose there would be some-",68
NA,thing in the honorable member's argument.,68
NA,"But, so far as I can ascertain, and so far",68
NA,as I have gathered from conversations with,68
NA,"people associated with the deal, T.A.A. did",68
NA,not want to make the arrangement. The,68
NA,"machines were an embarrassment to T.A.A.,",68
NA,which had to engage in a new kind of,68
NA,"traffic. For instance, it had to run charter",68
NA,flights bringing school children from Mel-,68
NA,bourne and Sydney to Canberra. This was,68
NA,a special new kind of traffic into which it,68
NA,was forced to enter for the benefit of Mr.,68
NA,"Ansett and his company. Mr Chairman,",68
NA,no one on this side of the House has any-,68
NA,thing against Mr Ansett personally. We,68
NA,have great respect for people who can use,68
NA,this Government in the way in which the,68
NA,head of Ansett Transport Industries Limited,68
NA,has apparently been able to do.,68
NA,In my view there is one aspect of the,68
NA,Government's dealings with airlines that,68
NA,completely condemns it. Ever since I,68
NA,entered this Parliament I have heard people,68
NA,"on the other side, including the Minister",68
NA,"for Defence ( Mr Townley), who is now at",68
NA,"the table, talking about the advantages of",68
NA,private enterprise competition and free,68
NA,trading. Yet we find that as soon as a,68
NA,"major government undertaking, with the",68
NA,spirit of the nation and the support of the,68
NA,"majority of the people behind it, is able",68
NA,"to put private enterprise on the skids, the",68
NA,supporters of the Government forgetabout,68
NA,"free and private enterprise, and they use",68
NA,the Parliament and the governmental power,68
NA,to support a private enterprise. As a,68
NA,result of this Government's legislation deal-,68
NA,ing with airlines we have become almost a,68
NA,partly-owned subsidiary of Ansett Trans-,68
NA,port Industries Limited. Here we see the,68
NA,Parliament of the Commonwealth of Aus-,68
NA,tralia spending considerable time in guaran-,68
NA,teeing the continued prosperity of a private,68
NA,enterprise airline. What must the people,69
NA,"outside think of this, or what would they",69
NA,think of it if they could get the straight,69
NA,facts?,69
NA,The simplest demonstration of the,69
NA,"vernment's patronage, of course, was its",69
NA,action in transferring its own freight,69
NA,passenger business partly to Ansett Transused,69
NA,"port Industries Limited, or to Australian",69
NA,"National Airways Limited, as it used to",69
NA,What would be the result if a person,69
NA,"into the Bankruptcy Court and, in reply",69
NA,"to the question, "" Why did you give part",69
NA,"of your business to your competitors?"",",69
NA,"he said, "" I thought this was only fair",69
NA,"just""? He would be charged with",69
NA,"behaviour. He would be accused of handpossible,",69
NA,ling his affairs in a haphazard and irresponfeed,69
NA,sible fashion. How can the Government went,69
NA,possibly justify such an arrangement?,69
NA,If this is an arrangement that is supparts,69
NA,"posed to work both ways, how much of condition.",69
NA,Ansett-A.N.A.'s business is transferred to,69
NA,T.A.A.? How many of the staff of Ansett-,69
NA,A.N.A. travel with T.A.A.? Is it not a,69
NA,fact that Mr Ansett sent circular letters,69
NA,"to many people in industry and commerce,",69
NA,"as well as in governmental organizations,",69
NA,including a large number of Melbourne,69
NA,"metropolitan municipal councils, contendof",69
NA,ing that T.A.A. was a government socialist,69
NA,enterprise and that it should not be supairline,69
NA,ported? I speak with some feeling about,69
NA,this attempt by the Government to use,69
NA,resources of the nation to foster the prossensible,69
NA,perity of private individuals who are in,69
NA,"no way directly responsible to this Parliatopography,",69
NA,ment or answerable in any way for the use,69
NA,of public revenue.,69
Mr HAMILTON ,Canning) [5.51] - I,69
NA,have not been in the chamber during most,69
NA,"of this debate, but I have had the opporTo-day",69
NA,"tunity of listening to it, and I am somewhat",69
NA,surprised at the attitude being displayed,69
NA,the Opposition. It is quite plain that this,69
NA,is purely a stunt during the closing hours,69
NA,"of this Parliament, the Opposition",69
NA,that it can gain some advantage on 9th,69
NA,"December. However, I do not think the",69
NA,people of Australia will be lulled into,69
NA,false sense of security by the sham battle,69
NA,that honorable members opposite are,69
NA,putting up. The honorable member for,69
NA,Wills ( Mr Bryant) said that the Government,69
NA,is using the resources of the nation to foster,69
NA,some private enterprise.,69
NA,Mr Bryant -Tha t is right.,69
Mr HAMILTON , I agree; that is what,69
NA,Goyou said. I want to remind the members,69
NA,of this Parliament and the people that when,69
NA,and the Labour Government was in office it,69
NA,the resources of the nation to make it,69
NA,impossible for private enterprise to function.,69
NA,be. There was a time when these self-same,69
NA,"went gentlemen opposite, or others of their",69
NA,"political persuasion, made the situation with",69
NA,regard to airlines in this country such that,69
NA,people flying in the aircraft of one operator,69
NA,and were running a very grave risk. The,69
NA,misLabour Government used every means,69
NA,"and used the nation's resources, to",69
NA,one airline and starve another. It,69
NA,so far as to refuse capital to the private,69
NA,airline operator so that it could get spare,69
NA,to keep its aircraft in a fit and proper,69
NA,Mr Daly -Tha t is not right.,69
Mr HAMILTON ,Th e honorable mem-,69
NA,"ber for Grayndler says that is not right,",69
NA,"but he used to sit here, as the member for",69
NA,"Martin, and support every move that was",69
NA,made by the government in those days.,69
NA,Since this Government has had command,69
NA,the treasury bench none of the strange,69
NA,things has been happening to a certain,69
NA,that happened before the Govern-,69
NA,ment came to power. Ever since 1949 this,69
NA,the Government has set out to achieve some,69
NA,arrangement to cover air transport,69
NA,"in Australia. This country, because of its",69
NA,is the safest in the world for,69
NA,"air transport, and the Government tried to",69
NA,make it possible for both airlines to func-,69
NA,tion. I think everybody will admit that,69
NA,some assistance has had to be given to the,69
NA,private airline to enable it to keep going.,69
NA,"we still have only 10,500,000 in",69
NA,"this country, and the private airline may",69
NA,by be getting only a small scraping of butter,69
NA,"on its bread, but as our population grows",69
NA,"both airlines will develop satisfactorily, so",69
NA,long as they do not go too deeply into,69
NA,hoping capital expenditure.,69
NA,I am surprised to hear some of the com-,69
NA,any ments coming from the Opposition side.,69
NA,The honorable member for Watson ( Mr.,69
NA,Cope) spoke about Rolls-Royce engines.,69
NA,Admittedly they are very good. The Rolls-,69
NA,Royce company has the proud record of,69
NA,"providing power for 54 per cent, of the air-",70
NA,lines of the world. 1 had the privilege,70
NA,only recently of inspecting one of its fac-,70
NA,tories in Scotland. I might inform the,70
NA,honorable member that quite a few,70
NA,American companies are using aircraft with,70
NA,Rolls-Royce engines.,70
NA,Mr Chaney -Th e Allison is a Rolls-,70
NA,Royce engine.,70
Mr HAMILTON ,Tha t is so. Honor-,70
NA,able members opposite have talked,70
NA,about the purchase of Electras,70
NA,and have suggested that Caravelles,70
NA,"should have been purchased. Well,",70
NA,"that is all in the past, and there is not",70
NA,the slightest doubt that the Electras are,70
NA,doing quite a good job.,70
NA,Mr Clyde Cameron -Ah !,70
Mr HAMILTON , I fly in them a lot,70
NA,more often and a lot farther than the,70
NA,honorable member does. I am not afraid,70
NA,to fly in them as are some Opposition,70
NA,members.,70
NA,Mr Townley -Th e Electra is the greatest,70
NA,money-spinner that we have ever had in,70
NA,the airline business.,70
Mr HAMILTON ,O f course it is. I,70
NA,"have forgotten the exactfigures,but, if my",70
NA,"memory serves me correctly, an Electra can",70
NA,fly at a profit with less than half its full,70
NA,complement of passengers. Other machines,70
NA,cannot do that.,70
NA,There has also been much criticism about,70
NA,the exchange by Trans-Australia Airlines of,70
NA,early-model Viscount aircraft for DC6 air-,70
NA,craft from Ansett-A.N.A. I think that the,70
NA,officials of every airline which has used,70
NA,DC6's on services to New Guinea will agree,70
NA,that they have been a godsend on those,70
NA,services. I think that any honorable,70
NA,member who thinks that he can play the,70
NA,part of a responsible representative of the,70
NA,"people in this Parliament and, at the same",70
NA,"time, decry the policy of keeping the two",70
NA,airlines going ought to see a psychiatrist.,70
NA,"If we develop an airline monopoly, whether",70
NA,"it be government or private, we may as",70
NA,well shut the hangar door and forget all,70
NA,;,70
NA,about civil aviation.,70
NA,Mr Chaney -Th? t applies particularly,70
NA,"in Western Australia,",70
Mr HAMILTON ,I t applies every-,70
NA,"where in Australia, and, as my friend has",70
NA,"said, it applies particularly in Western",70
NA,Australia.,70
NA,Mr Ward -Ansett-A.N.A . now has a,70
NA,monopoly of most of the intra-state,70
NA,services.,70
Mr HAMILTON ,Doe s the honorable,70
NA,member really think so?,70
NA,Mr Ward -Yes .,70
Mr HAMILTON , I suggest that the,70
NA,honorable member check the figures. I dis-,70
NA,agree with him. I do not think that Ansett-,70
NA,A.N.A. has such a monopoly.,70
NA,Mr Chaney -Th e honorable member for,70
NA,East Sydney is quite wrong.,70
Mr HAMILTON ," I disagree with him,",70
NA,anyway.,70
NA,Mr Davies -Quot e the figures!,70
Mr HAMILTON , I have forgotten the,70
NA,figures for the moment. The honorable,70
NA,member will not lead me away from what,70
NA,I want to say.,70
NA,The Opposition wants to omit from the,70
NA,"title of the principal act the words "" relating",70
NA,"to Air Transport, and for purposes con-",70
NA,"nected therewith "", in order, so it says, to",70
NA,prevent Ansett-A.N.A. from being given an,70
NA,unfair advantage. Why do honorable mem-,70
NA,bers opposite not think about the,70
NA,unfair advantage that Labour gave to,70
NA,Australian National Airways Proprietary,70
NA,"Limited, as that airline was known, a few",70
NA,"years ago, and about the havoc that was",70
NA,caused in the process?,70
NA,"In conclusion, I want to say merely that",70
NA,the people of Australia will take no notice,70
NA,of the sham fight that has been waged over,70
NA,the last few days and will not believe the,70
NA,stories that are published in some sections,70
NA,of the press. The people ought to think,70
NA,back a few years and reflect on what the,70
NA,"Australian Labour Party, which now aspires",70
NA,"to government, did when it was in office",70
NA,and had an opportunity to do something.,70
NA,I am certain that the people of Australia,70
NA,will refuse to have a bar of the Labour,70
NA,Party's ideas on any aspect of airline,70
NA,"operations, because Labour has no worth-",70
NA,while proposition to submit to the people.,70
NA,Labour's record condemns it even before,70
NA,it opens its election campaign.,70
NA,Sitting suspended from 5.59 to 8 p.m.,70
Mr WARD ,East Sydney) [8.0] -Prio r,71
NA,to the suspension of the sitting I spoke to,71
NA,the amendment which I have moved on,71
NA,behalf of the Opposition to clause 3 of,71
NA,the Airlines Agreements Bill. Earlier,71
NA,I had given a number of reasons to show,71
NA,that the long title of this bill was inappro-,71
NA,"priate and that, as the amendment proposes,",71
NA,the long title should explain that this is an,71
NA,act to approve certain agreements to give,71
NA,an unfair advantage to Ansett Transport,71
NA,"Industries Limited. Earlier, I gave a num-",71
NA,ber of instances of advantages which Ansett,71
NA,Transport Industries Limited was to be given,71
NA,"by the Government under this legislation,",71
NA,but time did not permit me to deal with,71
NA,the whole list of advantages. So 1 propose,71
NA,now to direct attention to what is intended,71
NA,by the Government in regard to the great,71
NA,national enterprise known as Trans-Aus-,71
NA,tralia Airlines.,71
NA,Everybody is aware that T.A.A. is a,71
NA,"efficiently run organization, and that it",71
NA,been giving an adequate return to the Treain,71
NA,sury-i f a return is required. The Labour,71
NA,"Party's attitude in that connexion, of course,",71
NA,is that T.A.A. should be regarded,71
NA,national undertaking giving service to,71
NA,Australian community. Under this properiod,71
NA,"posal a target profit is to be set each year,",71
NA,and the management of T.A.A. is to be,71
NA,obliged to try to reach that target. In,71
NA,mining the target the Minister has to,71
NA,a number of factors into account. The safety,71
NA,organization is to lose the advantage of,71
NA,ing cheaper interest on the advances made,71
NA,to it by the Treasury. It is also to lose,71
NA,"advantage of the self-insurance, which it",71
NA,"now carries to cover its operations, because",71
NA,under this legislation it is to be given,71
NA,option of continuing its self-insurance or,71
NA,insuring in the ordinary commercial,71
NA,If it carries self-insurance it is to be obliged,71
NA,to deduct from its earnings a sum equal,71
NA,the current commercial premiums for,71
NA,surance cover. Those premiums are based,71
NA,on the world market. That means that,71
NA,T.A.A. will lose the advantage of the,71
NA,cheaper system of carrying its own insuroutstrip,71
NA,"ance in the way it has done hitherto, and",71
NA,will have to pay the higher premium rate,71
NA,determined on the much higher incidence,71
NA,of accidents in overseas airlines. When,71
NA,those moneys are deducted from its earnings,71
NA,"it will not be able to use them, as it can",71
NA,"now, under its self-insurance scheme, in",71
NA,running of its business because it is now,71
NA,to be required to invest the moneys in Com-,71
NA,monwealth securities. That will place,71
NA,T.A.A. at a distinct disadvantage in com-,71
NA,parison with the position that it now occu-,71
NA,"pies as against its competitor, Ansett-A.N.A.",71
NA,"At present, T.A.A. uses its employees'",71
NA,superannuation fund contributions in the,71
NA,business. I do not think there is anything,71
NA,"wrong with that. It pays 3£ per cent,",71
NA,interest on the money used. But no longer,71
NA,is T.A.A. to be allowed to use those super-,71
NA,annuation funds in the running of the busi-,71
NA,"ness, because those, too, are to be invested",71
NA,in government securities.,71
NA,I have only one other thing to say about,71
NA,this matter. Prior to the suspension of,71
NA,"the sitting, the honorable member for",71
NA,Canning ( Mr Hamilton) said that the,71
NA,very Labour Opposition was only putting up a,71
NA,"has sham fight, and that we were not serious",71
NA,our opposition to this legislation. Let,71
NA,me assure the Government and its sup-,71
NA,porters that we are very serious about it.,71
NA,as a The honorable member for Canning,71
NA,"the accused the Opposition of trying, over a",71
NA,"of time, to destroy the private air-",71
NA,line by suggesting that it was unsafe and,71
NA,that the only safe way to travel by air,71
NA,deterwas by T.A.A. All I ask members of the,71
NA,take Parliament to do in order to judge the,71
NA,record of the two airlines is to make,71
NA,paya comparison of the number of accidents,71
NA,that have occurred in the operation of the,71
NA,the privately-owned airlines with those which,71
NA,have occurred in the government airline. If,71
NA,anybody wants proof of which is the safer,71
NA,the airline in the opinion of Government sup-,71
NA,"porters, he has only to look at the fact that",71
NA,field. although Government supporters and,71
NA,Government members are free to travel by,71
NA,to Ansett-A.N.A. if they choose the great,71
NA,inpreponderance of them show a preference,71
NA,for travel by T.A.A. So if there were any,71
NA,such thing as fair competition in the,71
NA,passenger flight field T.A.A. would quickly,71
NA,its rival. It is only because of,71
NA,this so-called rationalization policy by,71
NA,which T.A.A. is not allowed to act com-,71
NA,petitively in obtaining business for itself,71
NA,"and has its routes, its time-tables and its",71
NA,scale of fares determined by the rationali-,71
NA,"zation committee, that this is not possible.",71
NA,the That is what the Government regards as,71
NA,competition. Yet even in those circum-,72
NA,stances T.A.A. still gets the greater pro-,72
NA,portion of the travelling public to use its,72
NA,"service, because air travellers prefer it as",72
NA,a better and safer service.,72
NA,When it comes to the carrying of freight,72
NA,"the opposite position obtains, because some",72
NA,people do not mind endangering freight,72
NA,by sending it by Ansett-A.N.A. whereas,72
NA,they might prefer personally to travel by,72
NA,the safer airline T.A.A. So only 37 per,72
NA,"cent, of total freight is carried by T.A.A.,",72
NA,"and the balance, 63 per cent., is carried",72
NA,on the private airline. When T.A.A.,72
NA,applied to the rationalization committee to,72
NA,have steps taken to share freights on an,72
NA,equal basis as in the case of passenger,72
NA,services-i n my opinion quite a reasonable,72
NA,proposition in the circumstances-th e,72
NA,rationalization committee and the Govern-,72
NA,ment claimed that that would be an inter-,72
NA,ference with competition.,72
NA,Thus this airline is prevented from,72
NA,increasing its business. When it is a case,72
NA,of the private airline having the advantage,72
NA,"the Government does not interfere, but",72
NA,when the government airline has the advan-,72
NA,tage the Government interferes in order,72
NA,to see that some of the benefits which the,72
NA,government airline has earned by its wise,72
NA,and prudent management are handed over,72
NA,to the private airline. I should think that,72
NA,any reasonable person would realize that,72
NA,this legislation will provide definite advan-,72
NA,tages to the private airline as against,72
NA,T.A.A. That is why this side of the Par-,72
NA,liament heartily supports the amendment.,72
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,Higgins-- function,72
NA,"Treasurer) [8.8] -Earlie r in the day, when",72
NA,speaking in the second-reading debate in,72
NA,"the House, I described the performance of",72
NA,the Opposition in this matter as disgraceful,72
NA,and shameful. If ever those words were,72
NA,justified their justification was confirmed,72
NA,by some of the things which have been said,72
NA,by the spokesman for the Opposition at thiS,72
NA,committee stage of the bill-th e honorable,72
NA,member for East Sydney ( Mr Ward).,72
NA,wonder just how low the Opposition can get,72
NA,"in matters of this kind. It is one thing,",72
NA,to make for political purposes the kind of,72
NA,vicious personal attack which has been,72
NA,made on the Minister for Civil Aviation-,72
NA,"Mr Bryant - I rise to order, Mr Chairthe",72
NA,man. The Treasurer is imputing to this side,72
NA,of the chamber motives which are certainly,72
NA,not in accordance with the facts. I was one,72
NA,of the speakers in the debate. I think that,72
NA,"he has infringed the Standing Orders, and I",72
NA,ask for a withdrawal of the imputations.,72
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! There is,72
NA,no substance in that point of order.,72
Mr HAROLD HOLT , I was about to,72
NA,say that not only my colleague the Minister,72
NA,"for Civil Aviation-who , I think, requires",72
NA,"no defence by any member in this place,",72
NA,because there is no member opposite who be-,72
NA,lieves in his heart one word of the charges,72
NA,which have been bandied round so wildly,72
NA,against him here in recent days-ha s been,72
NA,subjected to attack; there is also the,72
NA,personal attack made on a man who has,72
NA,been one of the great pioneering figures in,72
NA,commercial aviation in Australia- Mr Reg,72
NA,Ansett. That is a dreadful thing to say to,72
NA,the people of Australia who are among the,72
NA,most air-minded people in the world. By,72
NA,reason of the vast distances we have to,72
NA,"cover, we are more frequent users of air-",72
NA,craft per head of population than probably,72
NA,any other people in the world.,72
NA,Yet here we have a spokesman for the,72
NA,"Australian Labour Party in this place who,",72
NA,"in order to achieve a cheap political trick,",72
NA,"has claimed that one airline is an insecure,",72
NA,dangerous airline for the people to use. It,72
NA,is the Department of Civil Aviation which,72
NA,determines the safety standards for flying,72
NA,in Australia. Australia can be very proud,72
NA,of (he safety record we have enjoyed. That,72
NA,"applies to all airlines-T.A.A. , Ansett-",72
NA,A.N.A. and the other airlines which,72
NA,in this country. If they were not,72
NA,operating on the safety standards which are,72
NA,required by the authorities they would be,72
NA,grounded. The very fact that their aircraft,72
NA,are in the air is proof that they are observing,72
NA,the conditions we prescribe for them. Any,72
NA,Opposition which descends to the tactics,72
NA,of trying to create in the minds of the public,72
NA,fears that they will be unsafe if they travel,72
NA,in a particular airline is worthy of the con-,72
NA,I demnation of the Australian people.,72
Mr HAYLEN ,Parkes) [8.12] -I f ever,72
NA,"Sir, there was a Jekyll and Hyde in the Parlia-",72
NA,ment it is the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt).,72
NA,"During this past week, the right honorable",72
NA,gentleman has been smearing members of,72
NA,Australian Labour Party who are :o,72
NA,stand for election to the Senate and has been,72
NA,enjoying himself thoroughly. To-night he,73
NA,came into the chamber beating his breast.,73
NA,We know that he comes from a well-known,73
NA,"theatrical family, but this sort of ham acting",73
NA,is not to be endured. He spoke of the,73
NA,Minister for Civil Aviation (Senator,73
NA,"Paltridge) as this Minister without reproach,",73
NA,this great man who has done all of these,73
NA,things. And then the right honorable,73
NA,gentleman switched a remark made by the,73
NA,honorable member for East Sydney ( Mr.,73
NA,Ward). All the honorable member for East,73
NA,Sydney did was to compare the safety reports,73
NA,"of the two airlines, something that could be",73
NA,legitimately done.,73
NA,But I want to return to the sneer and,73
NA,smear merchant who has qualified as one of,73
NA,the worst MCCarthy-ites in this chamber in,73
NA,one short week. We are putting it up to the,73
NA,Government that we are not taking it. Is,73
NA,the Government going to run into the dis-,73
NA,solution of this Parliament and out of this,73
NA,session without answering what people are,73
NA,saying outside? If supporters of the Go-,73
NA,vernment do not believe what we are saying,73
NA,"and if they think we are playing at politics,",73
NA,are they prepared to take up the challenge?,73
NA,Is the Government so smug that it does not,73
NA,believe anything can happen to it? If that,73
NA,"is what supporters of the Government think,",73
NA,"let them listen to what the "" Sydney Morn-",73
NA,"ing Herald"" has said. There are words",73
NA,there that any government with any guts,73
NA,would answer. It wou!d not run away from,73
NA,them. It would not duck into recess or dis-,73
NA,"solution and say, "" Thank God, we have",73
NA,"escaped that"".",73
NA,There is a case to answer and supporters,73
NA,of the Government should remember that if,73
NA,"they get out of this Parliament, we will pur-",73
NA,sue them through the electorate and demand,73
NA,"an answer. The "" Sydney Morning Herald """,73
NA,is a reputable newspaper. Sometimes it is,73
NA,"misguided in the way it reports my activities,",73
NA,"but I forgive it for that because, in a general",73
NA,"sense, it is pretty fair. It spoke yesterday",73
NA,of the sight of the Minister in tantrums and,73
NA,the Prime Minister ( Mr Menzies) defending,73
NA,him. But that was only the lead-in. It,73
NA,stated something that the Government should,73
NA,"consider. It uses such words as "" serious",73
NA,"scandal"" and "" a gross betrayal of prin-",73
NA,"ciple"". The newspaper has stated this in",73
NA,discussing the famous conversation that took,73
NA,place between the Minister and the directors,73
NA,of East-West Airlines. Did it take place?,73
NA,What was said? Who said it? It reflects,73
NA,the utter confusion of the public as to what,73
NA,"the Minister for Civil Aviation did say, or",73
NA,how many times he said what he did not,73
NA,"say, and how many people denied it. Then",73
NA,he was full of tantrums and fears.,73
NA,Let me tell the committee what the,73
NA,""" Sydney Morning Herald"" said and let",73
NA,the Government answer these statements,73
NA,before it gets out of this place. If it does,73
NA,"not answer it, the Government will stand",73
NA,condemned outside. This is what the,73
NA,""" Sydney Morning Herald "" stated to-day-",73
NA,"If, however, as a great many people will prefer",73
NA,to believe . . . the Federal Government,73
NA,through the Minister for Civil Aviation tried to,73
NA,intimidate a small private airline into surrendering,73
NA,to a big competitor manifestly favoured by the,73
NA,"Government in other directions, then the affair",73
NA,assumes the proportions of a serious scandal.,73
NA,"Are the Government, the Prime Minister and",73
NA,his Cabinet going to walk out of the Parlia-,73
NA,"ment and not answer the "" Sydney Morning",73
NA,"Herald ""? The newspaper has said that this",73
NA,""" assumes the proportions of a serious",73
NA,"scandal"". Yet we have this Jekyll and",73
NA,"Hyde getting up and saying: "" Look what the",73
NA,Labour Party is doing. Look at what the,73
NA,"honorable member for East Sydney said.""",73
NA,We are trying to bring the Government to,73
NA,a sense of its democratic responsibilities. If,73
NA,"what I have read is not enough, let me read",73
NA,the concluding passage referring to the inter-,73
NA,vention of the Government-,73
NA,That the Government should intervene at all in,73
NA,such an issue is beyond all propriety.,73
NA,Is the Government going outside this,73
NA,chamber and admitting that it is beyond all,73
NA,propriety? If it is power-drunk and does not,73
NA,care what sort of scandal is tied to its tail,73
NA,during the general election culminating on,73
NA,9th December; if it is afraid to face,73
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The remarks,73
NA,of the honorable member for Parkes have,73
NA,no relation to the bill or the amendment,73
NA,moved by the honorable member for East,73
NA,Sydney that are now before the committee.,73
NA,I rule that the honorable member must,73
NA,return to the subject before the committee.,73
Mr HAYLEN ,"Wil l you tell me, Sir,",73
NA,what was the relation of the remarks of,73
NA,the Treasurer in the same connexion? I,73
NA,am referring to the Airlines Agreements,73
NA,"Bill. The ""Sydney Morning Herald""",73
NA,stated in relation to the Government's,73
NA,attempt to promote a monopoly and force,74
NA,free enterprise out of existence that this,74
NA,was the grossest possible betrayal. Will the,74
NA,Government answer that charge? It is the,74
NA,grossest possible betrayal of the Govern-,74
NA,ment's policy. Is the Government going to,74
NA,re-write its policy speech for 9th,74
NA,"December, and say: "" We believe in the",74
NA,grossest possible betrayal of free enterprise.,74
NA,We believe we have concocted a scandal,74
NA,and we have not the guts,74
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The honorpened,74
NA,able member must direct his remarks,74
NA,the clause and the amendment before the,74
NA,committee.,74
Mr HAYLEN ,Perhap s you will he,74
NA,"allow me to say this, Sir: These are the",74
NA,hours of this Parliament and I would have 1946,74
NA,been grateful if you had intervened to pro-,74
NA,tect me from the Treasurer. Since that,74
NA,"cannot happen, I will conclude by saying",74
NA,that I support what the honorable member,74
NA,for East Sydney has said and I deny what,74
NA,"the Treasurer has said in bis simulated,",74
NA,phoney anxiety about the airlines. He,74
NA,could not care a tinker's damn. All he,74
NA,was trying to do was to secure a point.,74
NA,We are trying to provoke the Government,74
NA,and its supporters into some sensibility,74
NA,their democratic duties. We ask them,74
NA,stand up to this fight and not run away.,74
NA,We ask supporters of the Government to,74
NA,listen to the amendments and debate them. tioned by them.,74
NA,Apart from the Minister for Defence ( Mr.,74
NA,Townley) there has not been a senior Minis-,74
NA,ter at the table or a Minister in the,74
NA,ber when we have been discussing this,74
NA,"matter. We are contesting the title,",74
NA,clause and the agreement and we will conCanning,74
NA,test the schedule until we bring Ministers,74
NA,to their feejt to denounce this thing.,74
NA,A charge has been made outside by,74
NA,responsible people that the Government,74
NA,been guilty of the grossest act in relation,74
NA,to its own policy and that this is a public,74
NA,scandal. Will the Government sit down,74
NA,"and take it? If so, we have every right to",74
NA,keep moving amendment after amendment lating,74
NA,until we bring the Government to a sense,74
NA,of its duty.,74
Mr CHANEY ,Perth) [8.19] -Th,74
NA,honorable member for Parkes ( Mr Haylen),74
NA,only has to shift the rose in his buttonhole,74
NA,to his nose and he would really look like,74
NA,Ferdinand the bull. Ferdinand was brought,74
NA,up on the plains of Spain to be a very,74
NA,"terrible fighter, but when it came to the",74
NA,point he was not so good. What the honor-,74
NA,able member has said is a lot of nonsense.,74
NA,If you go to the Parliamentary Library,74
NA,there is a book there on how to lie with,74
NA,statistics. It is an extremely useful publica-,74
NA,tion and the honorable member for Parkes,74
NA,as an author might appreciate it. There is,74
NA,a story in this book about a man who was,74
NA,drowned in a river with an average depth,74
NA,of 7 inches. That is exactly what has hap-,74
NA,with this bill. Since the sitting was,74
NA,"to resumed to-night, the honorable member",74
NA,"for Canning ( Mr Hamilton), who is not",74
NA,"with us at present, made a speech in which",74
NA,pointed out that in his early days in,74
NA,final Parliament- I think he was elected in,74
NA,"Mr Haylen - I rise to order, Mr Chair-",74
NA,"man. If what I said was irrelevant, will",74
NA,you rule as to whether the honorable,74
NA,member's remarks are relevant at the,74
NA,moment? The clause before the committee,74
NA,now deals with the title of the bill. What,74
NA,relation has this to Ferdinand the bull?,74
The CHAIRMAN ,Ther e is no sub-,74
NA,stance in the point of order taken by the,74
NA,of honorable member for Parkes. The honor-,74
NA,to able member for Perth has mentioned two,74
NA,honorable members who have spoken on,74
NA,the bill and has referred to matters men-,74
Mr CHANEY ,A HI have done is to,74
NA,chammake a few introductory remarks. The,74
NA,honorable member for East Sydney ( Mr.,74
NA,the Ward) took the honorable member for,74
NA,to task on what he said about the,74
NA,Government assisting one airline to the,74
NA,detriment of another. This was at a definite,74
NA,"period, just after the war, when parts were",74
NA,hard to get and only some varieties of,74
NA,has aircraft were available. He said- I take,74
NA,his word for it-tha t favouritism was,74
NA,extended to Trans-Australia Airlines. The,74
NA,honorable member for East Sydney men-,74
NA,tioned the accident rate. The statistics re-,74
NA,to civil aviation in Australia for the,74
NA,"overall operation of all airlines, including",74
NA,"T.A.A. and Ansett-A.N.A., would surprise",74
NA,"e honorable members. To my knowledge,",74
NA,there have been only two fatal crashes. One,74
NA,occurred with an Ansett-A.N.A. aircraft in,74
NA,the days when the organization was Aus-,74
NA,tralian National Airways Proprietary,74
NA,Limited. A DC4 crashed in the hills near,75
NA,York after take-off from Perth.,75
NA,"Mr Cope -On e crashed in Tasmania,",75
NA,too.,75
Mr CHANEY ,"Yes , but that was a",75
NA,freighter.,75
NA,"Mr Cope -No , it was a passenger",75
NA,aircraft.,75
Mr CHANEY ,I f the honorable mem-,75
NA,ber looks up the records he will find I am,75
NA,right. I am referring to accidents in which,75
NA,passengers were involved. Following the,75
NA,"crash of the DC4 near Perth, there was a",75
NA,tremendously long inquiry. I attended some,75
NA,of the sessions. The best legal brains in,75
NA,"Australia appeared at the inquiry, but the",75
NA,cause of the crash was not determined.,75
NA,Originally it was thought that there was,75
NA,water in the petrol. Other theories were,75
NA,advanced and experts were brought from,75
NA,"America. However, the cause of the crash",75
NA,was never definitely established. Then,75
NA,T.A.A. had a fatal crash at Mackay when,75
NA,a Fokker Friendship went into the sea at,75
NA,night. The cause of this has been guessed,75
NA,at or assumed.,75
NA,The worst feature of this debate is that,75
NA,honorable members should use aircraft,75
NA,crashes in this way. The accident rate is,75
NA,the lowest in the world and it should not,75
NA,be used as some sort of political lever. We,75
NA,should keep in mind that relatives are still,75
NA,interested in these matters. Our low acci-,75
NA,dent rate does great credit to the Depart-,75
NA,ment of Civil Aviation for the rules and,75
NA,regulations it has introduced and enforced.,75
NA,This action has made air travel in Australia,75
NA,extremely safe. If honorable members,75
NA,"want any proof of this, they need only go",75
NA,"to an insurance company, For a few",75
NA,"pounds, they can obtain a tremendous cover",75
NA,on their lives if they are about to travel,75
NA,in an aeroplane. The odds prove that air,75
NA,travel here is much safer than is travel in,75
NA,motor vehicles or by any other means. To,75
NA,bring in the accident rate and to talk about,75
NA,airlines in this way is a poor,75
NA,"In actual fact, the two airlines have much",75
NA,"the same record, and both can be extremely",75
NA,proud of their records. Their records are,75
NA,good because the Department of Civil Avia-,75
NA,"tion, administered by Senator Paltridge, lays",75
NA,down rules that make it almost impossible,75
NA,for aeroplanes to crash or for people to,75
NA,lose their lives.,75
NA,Mr Jones -Wh y does the Government,75
NA,not agree to appoint a royal commission?,75
Mr CHANEY ,I f we were to appoint,75
NA,a royal commission on everything you raised,75
NA,"in this place, we would never finish. I",75
NA,"have been here for only six years, but the",75
NA,Opposition has objected to everything the,75
NA,Government has done. Does that mean,75
NA,we should have a royal commission on,75
NA,everything? Surely it is about time the,75
NA,Opposition accepted something.,75
NA,The honorable member for East Sydney,75
NA,said that the proof that T.A.A. was a better,75
NA,and a safer airline was the number of,75
NA,Government members who travelled on it.,75
NA,If honorable members look at the statistics,75
NA,of airline travel they will find that there,75
NA,are certain passenger loading factors that,75
NA,must be observed if the airline is to operate,75
NA,profitably. If this chamber rose at 9 o'clock,75
NA,"to-night, I am quite certain that those mem-",75
NA,bers who are fortunate enough to live in,75
NA,Melbourne or Sydney only an hour or an,75
NA,"hour and a half away, would have a special",75
NA,aircraft provided for' them. They are not,75
NA,like us poor unfortunates who must travel,75
NA,to Western Australia.,75
NA,Mr Turnbull - I take longer to reach my,75
NA,home than you do.,75
Mr CHANEY , I accept that the honor-,75
NA,able member for Mallee takes longer to,75
NA,reach his home than we do. If a special,75
NA,aircraft were brought here for honorable,75
NA,"members, it would have a 100 per cent,",75
NA,load factor but would still operate at a loss.,75
NA,Any special aircraft must come here first,75
NA,without any load and therefore the maxi-,75
NA,"mum load factor it could have, even if",75
NA,every seat were occupied on the outward,75
NA,"flight, would be 50 per cent. I do not say",75
NA,that honorable members should be denied,75
NA,"this privilege, but a company such as",75
NA,Ansett-A.N.A. has a responsibility to its,75
NA,shareholders to ensure that its load factor,75
NA,"is above 50 per cent, or, in some instances,",75
NA,political trick. above 70 per cent.,75
NA,Mr L. R. Johnson -Thi s is a bit wide of,75
NA,the clause.,75
Mr CHANEY ,I t is a salient fact. It,75
NA,is very easy to stand up here and make,75
NA,statements that are not based on facts.,75
NA,Honorable members should obtain copies,76
NA,"of the book "" How to Lie with Statistics"".",76
NA,"Mr L. R. Johnson - Mr Chairman, I",76
NA,wish to take a point of order. Having in,76
NA,mind that you ruled the speech of the honor-,76
NA,"able member for Parkes out of order,",76
NA,I ask you whether the honorable member,76
NA,for Perth is directing his speech to the,76
NA,clause under discussion?,76
The CHAIRMAN ,Th e honorable memborrowers,76
NA,ber for Perth is relating his remarks to,76
NA,amendment moved by the Opposition. The,76
NA,honorable member for Parkes was not doing,76
NA,so. When I ruled that the honorable memproperty,76
NA,"ber for Parkes was out of order, I explained",76
NA,my reason and I pointed out that he was,76
NA,not directing his remarks to the,76
NA,to the amendment. There is no substance,76
NA,jn the point of order raised by the honoronly,76
NA,able member for Hughes.,76
Mr CHANEY , I want to say only one,76
NA,thing before I sit down.,76
NA,"Mr Daly -Tha t will be enough, too.",76
Mr CHANEY ," I think it will, actually.",76
NA,Your words are prophetic.,76
NA,"As I said, the debate was being drawn",76
NA,by the Opposition this afternoon. I and,76
NA,many of my colleagues are quite willing,76
NA,"sit here all night, if necessary. After all,",76
NA,I cannot catch an aeroplane back to Western,76
NA,"Australia until to-morrow afternoon, and",76
NA,"am quite willing to stay here all to-morrow,",76
NA,too. But I am determined to stand in my,76
NA,place at every opportunity and answer all,76
NA,the wild statements made by honorable,76
NA,members opposite. I refer honorable memstruction of homes.,76
NA,"bers to the Senate "" Hansard"" of 4th",76
NA,"October last at page 875. There, a table of",76
NA,"comparative safety factors is given, with",76
NA,"the passenger fatalities per 100,000,000",76
NA,miles flown. I am an air traveller and,76
NA,former member of the Royal Australian Air,76
NA,Force. I think the Deputy Leader of the,76
NA,Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) will agree with,76
NA,me that the way to bring on crashes in the,76
NA,Air Force was to talk about them or to,76
NA,about the safety factor; some one was,76
NA,to upset the safety record. I do not appremade,76
NA,ciate this subject being brought into the,76
NA,debate.,76
NA,Progress reported.,76
NA,WAR SERVICE HOMES BILL 1961.,76
NA,Second Reading.,76
NA,Debate resumed from 29th August (vide,76
NA,"page 541), on motion by Mr Roberton-",76
NA,That the bill be now read a second time.,76
Mr STEWART ,Lang) [8.30] -Thi s biil,76
NA,seeks to make two minor amendments to,76
NA,the principal act. One of those amend-,76
NA,ments relates to excess moneys paid in by,76
NA,from the War Service Homes,76
NA,the Division. It provides that the borrower,76
NA,may withdraw excess payments to effect,76
NA,"repairs, make additions or alterations to his",76
NA,and do other things to conserve,76
NA,and increase his equity in that property.,76
NA,This is in conformity with what has been,76
NA,clause or the practice for years now.,76
NA,The second amendment provides that,76
NA,eligible persons may obtain loans from,76
NA,the War Service Homes Division.,76
NA,"Apparently, because of loop-holes in the",76
NA,"act, there has developed a practice under",76
NA,which certain people who have not been,76
NA,enti.led to them have obtained loans from,76
NA,the War Service Homes Division. The,76
NA,Opposition does not oppose the measure.,76
NA,But we do argue that the administration,76
NA,"of the War Service Homes Act, under",76
NA,out which money is made available at 3 i per,76
NA,"cent, interest over long periods, has demon-",76
NA,to strated clearly that money can be lent at,76
NA,low rates of interest over long periods with,76
NA,profit to those administering the scheme.,76
NA,I We therefore suggest lhat the Government,76
NA,should introduce a scheme similar to this,76
NA,for the lending of money to all sections,76
NA,of the community at low rates of interest,76
NA,over long periods for the purchase or con-,76
NA,"I propose to show that, whilst the war",76
NA,"service homes scheme is a magnificent one,",76
NA,it has been deliberately hamstrung by this,76
NA,a Government in that it has suffered from,76
NA,shortage of funds. That the activities of,76
NA,the War Service Homes Division have been,76
NA,curtailed by this Government is plain from,76
NA,a perusal of the reports of that organiza-,76
NA,talk tion. Part V. of the act lays down the,76
NA,sure conditions under which advances may be,76
NA,"to eligible persons. For instance, an",76
NA,advance may be made to an eligible person,76
NA,to enable him to erect a dwelling house on,76
NA,"his holding, or to purchase land and erect",76
NA,"thereon a dwelling house, or to purchase a",76
NA,"dwelling house, together with the land on",77
NA,"which it is erected, or to enlarge a dwelling",77
NA,"house owned by him, and so on. The act",77
NA,also provides that the Director of War,77
NA,"Service Homes, may, at the discretion of the",77
NA,"Minister, take over existing mortgages or",77
NA,grant second assistance. It is only in very,77
NA,rare instances that those two provisions can,77
NA,be availed of.,77
NA,One important point which I wish to,77
NA,emphasize is that considerable delay takes,77
NA,place between the time of making applica-,77
NA,tion and the time of obtaining loans for,77
NA,the purposes set out in the act.,77
NA,"instance, the delay in obtaining finance for",77
NA,the purchase of existing properties is 20,77
NA,months while that in obtaining money for,77
NA,the carrying out of extensions is eighteen,77
NA,months. In those cases where applicants,77
NA,wish to buy homes which the division itself,77
NA,"has erected under group schemes, the delay",77
NA,in obtaining finance in Nesv South Wales,77
NA,"is sixteen months. In Queensland, it is",77
NA,"eight months, and in Western Australia six",77
NA,"months, although, of course, that time",77
NA,includes the time taken to construct the,77
NA,house. It is a long time now since loans,77
NA,could be obtained without having to wait,77
NA,for any time at all. Because of this long,77
NA,"waiting time, many ex-servicemen who",77
NA,would be eligible for assistance from the,77
NA,War Service Homes Division have found it,77
NA,necessary to obtain accommodation,77
NA,elsewhere.,77
Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. John MCLeay),77
NA,Order! I direct the honorable member's,77
NA,attention to the fact that this is not a wide,77
NA,open bill. I very much doubt whether,77
NA,question of waiting time can,77
NA,to this measure. 1 suggest that the honor-,77
NA,able member keep that in mind from now the bill:-,77
NA,on.,77
NA,Mr Haylen - I rise to order. Do you,77
NA,consider that this is not a wide open bill? fifty,77
NA,Have you a copy of the bill before you?,77
Mr SPEAKER ,Yes .,77
NA,Mr Haylen -I t concerns administration,77
NA,and the approval of loans. In my,77
NA,it is in essence a wide bill.,77
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! This is a very,77
NA,restricted bill. 1 find difficulty in deciding,77
NA,whether the honorable member's remarks,77
NA,are relevant to the measure. I think a degree,77
NA,of tolerance should be exercised. At the,77
NA,"same time, I suggest that there should be no",77
NA,abuse of that tolerance.,77
Mr STEWART , I am endeavouring to,77
NA,show that further amendments to the act are,77
NA,required to make the scheme work in the,77
NA,way in which it was intended it should work,77
NA,when the act was introduced in 1918. Since,77
NA,"it was introduced in 1918, 224,775 persons",77
NA,have been assisted and of that number,77
NA,54 024 were returned servicemen from,77
NA,"World War I., while 170,751 were returned",77
NA,"servicemen from World War II . , Korea and",77
NA,"Malaya. Only 16 per cent, of those eligible",77
NA,For servicemen who returned from World War,77
NA,1. have received assistance. Possibly that,77
NA,is because from the end of World War I .,77
NA,until the 1930's money was not very plen-,77
NA,"tiful. During that period, we went through",77
NA,a great depression and many people who,77
NA,would have liked to buy homes were un-,77
NA,able to find the necessary deposit.,77
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! The honorable,77
NA,member will not be in order in referring,77
NA,to waiting time. The honorable member is,77
NA,now opening up a wide discussion of the,77
NA,whole question of war service homes. This,77
NA,"is a very restricted measure, and I suggest",77
NA,that he try to co-operate with the Chair.,77
Mr STEWART ,Th e Opposition,77
NA,intends to move an amendment to the bill,77
NA,and I am endeavouring to put the arguments,77
NA,in favour of the amendment.,77
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! It would be,77
NA,"better to move the amendment, if the",77
NA,honorable member wishes to speak to it.,77
Mr STEWART ,O n behalf of tbe,77
NA,"the Opposition, I propose an amendment in",77
NA,be related the following terms:-,77
NA,That the following new clause be inserted in,77
NA,""" 2A. Section twenty-one of the Principal Act",77
NA,is amended by omitting from sub-section (I.),77
NA,the words ' Two thousand seven hundred and,77
NA,pounds' and inserting in their stead,77
NA,"the words ' Three thousand five hundred pounds'.""",77
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! If the honor-,77
NA,"able member wants to pursue that line,",77
NA,it would be better to wait until the bill is,77
NA,opinion being discussed in committee.,77
Mr STEWART ,Ca n I foreshadow an,77
NA,amendment at this stage?,77
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! The honor-,77
NA,able member will not be in order in open-,77
NA,ing a wide debate on war service homes.,77
NA,"In the course of his second-reading speech,",77
NA,the Minister directed attention to the fact,78
NA,that the bill proposed to tighten up cer-,78
NA,tain minor matters in connexion with war,78
NA,service homes. It is very difficult to,78
NA,decide what is and what is not relevant to,78
NA,"the measure. I think that, with a degree of",78
NA,tolerance and the co-operation of honor-,78
NA,"able members, we shall get along all right.",78
Mr STEWART ,Ma y I point out that,78
NA,this is a bill for an act to amend the War,78
NA,Service Homes Act 1918-1956. If it is,78
NA,"a bill to amend the whole of the act, then,",78
NA,"surely, the whole of the act is open for",78
NA,discussion.,78
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! The honor-,78
NA,able member will not be in order in can-,78
NA,vassing my ruling. The whole of the act,78
NA,is not open for discussion.,78
NA,Mr Haylen - I rise to order. I am,78
NA,"not canvassing your ruling, except to say",78
NA,"that it has been the practice in this House,",78
NA,when acts are being amended even ever,78
NA,"so slightly, to give honorable members the",78
NA,opportunity of debating the whole of the,78
NA,act. That is a practice which has de-,78
NA,"veloped because of your generosity, and",78
NA,the honorable member for Lang is follow-,78
NA,ing that practice. As this is the last major,78
NA,"measure before the House, I suggest that",78
NA,you might place a wider interpretation,78
NA,on it.,78
NA,Mr Whitlam -O n the point of order:,78
NA,No Government supporter has taken a,78
NA,point of order that the honorable,78
NA,member for Lang ( Mr Stewart) was speakdeficiencies,78
NA,ing too widely in saying what he has,78
NA,"already said. You, Sir, have ruled sponbetween",78
NA,taneously that he is out of order because,78
NA,"he is speaking too widely. On that,",78
NA,should like to make two submissions.,78
NA,first is that the practice is to allow members,78
NA,to speak on the subject-matter of a prinable,78
NA,cipal act when there is any amendment agreement.,78
NA,"to that principal act, unless the long title",78
NA,of the amending bill limits discussion. I,78
NA,perfectly apprehend that where the long,78
NA,"title refers, say, to one section or",78
NA,matter in the principal act honorable mem-,78
NA,bers have to confine themselves to that,78
NA,"section or that matter. If, however, as of?",78
NA,"in the present case, there is no such limita-",78
NA,"tion in the long title of the bill, honorable",78
NA,members are entitled to address themselves,78
NA,to anything which arises under the prin-,78
NA,cipal act.,78
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,No .,78
NA,Mr Whitlam -Th e other point I wish,78
NA,to make is this: Since the Leader of the,78
NA,"House, the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt),",78
NA,"has by interjection come into this matter,",78
NA,I point out that it was understood between,78
NA,him and me that there would be a full,78
NA,debate on war service homes under this,78
NA,"bill. For that reason, Sir, there was no pro-",78
NA,longed debate-a s there has been in pre-,78
NA,vious years-o n the appropriate portion,78
NA,"of the Estimates. You, Sir, cannot be here",78
NA,"while the debate on the Estimates proceeds,",78
NA,"but I can inform you that for several years,",78
NA,since there was last an amendment to the,78
NA,War Service Homes Act-ther e has not,78
NA,been one since 1956,78
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,Ther e is legislation,78
NA,every year.,78
NA,"Mr Whitlam -Ther e is not, in fact.",78
NA,The last time the principal act was,78
NA,amended was in 1956. On that occasion,78
NA,there was a full debate on the principal act,78
NA,and the administration of the War Service,78
NA,Homes Division during consideration of the,78
NA,"amending bill. Since then, there has been",78
NA,a full debate on the administration of the,78
NA,War Service Homes Division and the,78
NA,deficiencies of the act at the appropriate,78
NA,stage of the debate on the Estimates. On,78
NA,"this occasion, the Opposition forwent the",78
NA,opportunity for its annual debate on the,78
NA,War Service Homes Division and the,78
NA,"of the act, when the item of the",78
NA,Estimates came on. The understanding,78
NA,the right honorable gentleman and,78
NA,"me, Sir, was that the opportunity would",78
NA,"I appropriately arise, and would be given",78
NA,The by the Government and taken by the,78
NA,"Opposition, on this bill. The right honor-",78
NA,gentleman shakes his head in dis-,78
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,Th e only under-,78
NA,standing was on the amount of time to be,78
NA,one allocated to the Estimates as a whole.,78
NA,NA,78
Mr HAROLD HOLT , I am just wonder-,78
NA,ing why you are stonewalling the,78
NA,proceedings of the Parliament.,78
NA,Mr Whitlam -Th e right honorable,79
NA,gentleman will concede that in 1957 and,79
NA,"succeeding years, when there have been",79
NA,amendments to the War Service Homes plaining,79
NA,"Act, there have been full debates on the",79
NA,estimates for the War Service Homes,79
NA,sion. He will not dispute that.,79
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,Yo u have had the,79
NA,same length of time on the Estimates,79
NA,year as in other years.,79
NA,Mr Whitfcm -Th e right honorable,79
NA,gentleman should have the grace to conknowledge,79
NA,cede that there was no prolonged,79
NA,sion during the Estimates debate on any,79
NA,subject-thi s among them-whic h was,79
NA,ing up under substantive legislation. This,79
NA,matter was known to be coming up. The,79
NA,bill was received from the other place,79
NA,months ago. Everybody knew that it,79
NA,would be coming up towards the,79
NA,session and it was expected that there,79
NA,would be a full debate-th e usual debate,79
NA,on war service homes-unde r this bill. For,79
NA,"those two reasons, Sir, I submit that",79
NA,should allow this debate to take place in,79
NA,the traditional way and that you should not,79
NA,truncate it.,79
NA,Mr Roberton - I refrained from rising,79
NA,to a point of order when the honorable,79
NA,"member for Lang began his speech times,",79
NA,"because, my intention, like yours, Sir, was",79
NA,to be generous to the honorable member,79
NA,so long as he confined himself in general,79
NA,terms to the amendments contained in this,79
NA,amending legislation. In my second-reading,79
NA,"speech, I said that the bill had two purposes",79
NA,only. The first was to validate a tradidecision,79
NA,tional practice that had been in operation,79
NA,to the advantage of those who qualified for,79
NA,war service homes since 1933 and which,79
NA,"now has been discovered to be dubious,",79
NA,measured against the principal act.,79
NA,second was to remove an anomaly which,79
NA,was prejudicial to those who qualified for,79
NA,war service homes and those who are,79
NA,"the waiting list, waiting for their applicaspread",79
NA,tions to be favorably considered. My,79
NA,second-reading speech made no reference,79
NA,to any other aspect of the question at,79
NA,Throughout the whole of that speech I emattitudes,79
NA,"phasized, at convenient points- -",79
NA,Mr Haylen -I t does not matter what,79
NA,you say.,79
NA,"Mr Roberton -Admittedly , it did not",79
NA,"matter what I said, but I tried to convey",79
NA,no to the House that this bill that I was ex-,79
NA,at that point of time had two pur-,79
NA,"poses, and two purposes only, and that it",79
NA,Diviwas the intention of the Government to,79
NA,restrict the bill to those two purposes. If,79
NA,"any confusion has arisen, the Government",79
NA,must be exonerated in this instance. I,79
NA,this have no knowledge of any arrangmeents,79
NA,that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition,79
NA,( Mr Whitlam) may have made with the,79
NA,Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt). I had no,79
NA,of them at the time; I have no,79
NA,discusknowledge of them now. But in the,79
NA,interests of those who have qualified for,79
NA,comwar service homes and in the interests,79
NA,of those who are waiting for their applica-,79
NA,"tions to be favorably considered, there is",79
NA,two an obligation on the House to pass this,79
NA,legislation as quickly and with as much,79
NA,end of the unanimity as possible.,79
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,Th e Deputy,79
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam),79
NA,you has sought to put before the House what,79
NA,he alleges to have been certain arrangements,79
NA,"made with relation to the business, including",79
NA,"this matter, which is currently before you,",79
NA,"Sir, for consideration. The first point I",79
NA,make on that is that the Deputy Leader,79
NA,"has made it clear to me, not once but many",79
NA,that be had no authority whatever,79
NA,from the Opposition to reach any agreement,79
NA,with me in my capacity as Leader of the,79
NA,House. He puts views before me and he,79
NA,says that it is for the Government to decide,79
NA,what action it proposes to take in relation,79
NA,to the business and that he will report that,79
NA,to the members of his party. So,79
NA,there is no question-an d I am sure that,79
NA,he would be the first to be embarrassed if,79
NA,anybody were to suggest that there was-,79
NA,of any agreement having been reached,79
NA,The between him and me on this matter.,79
NA,"Secondly, the same time has been made",79
NA,"on available by the Government this year,",79
NA,over the period of discussion of the,79
NA,"Estimates, as was the case last year. That",79
NA,"is a period which, I think, honorable",79
NA,all. members have agreed-b y their general,79
NA,anyhow-t o be reasonable for the,79
NA,purpose. A variety of important subject,79
NA,matters has been before us by way of,79
NA,amending legislation. If the honorable,79
NA,gentleman is right in maintaining that every,79
NA,amending bill that comes along provides,80
NA,the opportunity for a full-dress debate on,80
NA,"a wide area of Government policy, legis-",80
NA,"lation and administration, we could never",80
NA,hope to get through the business of the,80
NA,Parliament in an orderly fashion at all.,80
NA,"There are rules of relevancy, Sir, which you",80
NA,"have the responsibility to apply and which,",80
NA,"if I may say so with respect, you apply very",80
NA,effectively. I believe the House is entitled,80
NA,"on this occasion, as on others, to the appli-",80
NA,cation of those rules. The honorable,80
NA,member for Lang who is in charge of the,80
NA,"bill for the Opposition, has given notice of",80
NA,an amendment which he proposes to move.,80
NA,"I understand that the amendment is in order,",80
NA,and on that matter the Opposition will be,80
NA,"able to put its viewpoint. That, I gather, is",80
NA,the principal matter which honorable gentle-,80
NA,"men opposite wish to bring before us, in",80
NA,any event. But what is becoming increas-,80
NA,"ingly apparent, I regret to say, on this",80
NA,closing day of the session-an d there is not,80
NA,an honorable member around the chamber,80
NA,who has not been aware that this is the,80
NA,closing day of the session-i s that the,80
NA,"Opposition, either officially or because of",80
NA,its lack of internal discipline as the result,80
NA,"of action by individual members, is deter-",80
NA,mined to stonewall the proceedings of the,80
NA,Parliament and convert the final stages of,80
NA,the session into something of a shambles.,80
NA,I hope the House will not lend itself to those,80
NA,practices.,80
Mr SPEAKER ,A s I have already other,80
NA,pointed out to the honorable member for,80
NA,Lang the Standing Orders do not provide,80
NA,for a wide open debate on war service,80
NA,homes on this measure. It is very difficult,80
NA,to determine what is relevant and what is,80
NA,"not, but such matters as the waiting time",80
NA,for the granting of loans are not relevant.,80
NA,If honorable members will be reasonable,80
NA,will the Chair.,80
Mr STEWART ," Mr Speaker, I bow to",80
NA,your ruling and I do not intend to canvass,80
NA,"it. I propose, during the rest of my speech,",80
NA,to relate my remarks to clause 2 which long,80
NA,begins-,80
NA,Section three of the Principal Act is repealed,80
NA,and the following section inserted in its stead:-,80
NA,It then goes on to mention such things as,80
NA,the sale of homes on the rent-purchase,80
NA,"system, advances on mortgage for purposes",80
NA,"of homes, conditions of contracts of sale",80
NA,"and advances, funds and, finally, ""miscel-",80
NA,"laneous "". I feel that under those headings",80
NA,I would be entitled to talk in the same vein,80
NA,as I was following before the point of order,80
NA,"was taken, but I would like first to chal-",80
NA,lenge a statement made by the Treasurer,80
NA,( Mr Harold Holt). The fact that the Go-,80
NA,vernment has determined the time for the,80
NA,session to end does not mean that the,80
NA,voices on this side of the House will be,80
NA,stilled. We have a right to express our,80
NA,opinions on every matter that comes before,80
NA,"this chamber, and for the Treasurer to",80
NA,accuse us of stonewalling is completely,80
NA,wrong.,80
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,I f you do that you,80
NA,will be coming back next week.,80
Mr STEWART, I am quite happy to,80
NA,come back next week. It is the Treasurer,80
NA,who has taken umbrage because we intend,80
NA,to talk on this measure. Let me say to him:,80
NA,There will be a returned soldiers' con-,80
NA,ference in Canberra beginning next week.,80
NA,On the agenda of the conference there is,80
NA,a host of items dealing with the administra-,80
NA,tion of the War Service Homes Division,80
NA,including an increase of the maximum,80
NA,"amount of loan, eligibility of people to apply",80
NA,for war service homes and so on. The,80
NA,organization concerned expects members on,80
NA,both sides of this House to express their,80
NA,views. I am speaking at the moment of the,80
NA,"Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's",80
NA,"Imperial League of Australia, but there are",80
NA,"ex-servicemen's organizations, includ-",80
NA,ing the Australian Legion of Ex-servicemen,80
NA,"and Women, which have emphasized their",80
NA,displeasure with the way in which the War,80
NA,Service Homes Act is being administered.,80
NA,"If the Treasurer wishes, he can go back to",80
NA,his electorate and see that the ladies of,80
NA,Malvern do not interfere with his campaign.,80
NA,so He can also meet the people whom he,80
NA,claimed in this House were being financed,80
NA,by sinister elements. But we are here to,80
NA,do a job for the people we represent and I,80
NA,think we are all entitled to speak for as,80
NA,"as we like, or as long as we are allowed",80
NA,to under the Standing Orders.,80
NA,There is no doubt that the ex-service-,80
NA,men's organizations are far from satisfied,80
NA,with the administration of the War Service,80
NA,Homes Act. They have made repeated re-,80
NA,quests for amendments but those amend-,80
NA,ments have not been made. We intend to,80
NA,show that the act is being administered in-,81
NA,correctly-no t by the officers of the depart-,81
NA,"ment, but by the Minister and by the Go-",81
NA,"vernment, who have hamstrung the depart-",81
NA,ment by not giving it the necessary finance.,81
NA,The Government has kept the scheme from,81
NA,working properly although it has proved,81
NA,that it can work satisfactorily and can pro-,81
NA,vide homes at a very low cost to a great,81
NA,"number of people. There are 800,000 ex-",81
NA,"servicemen from the last war, the Korean",81
NA,"war and the Malayan campaign, who would",81
NA,"be eligible for homes, but the Director of",81
NA,the War Service Homes Division in his,81
NA,"last report anticipated that only 240,000",81
NA,"or 30 per cent, of them would seek assist-",81
NA,ance. Obviously there are many more ex-,81
NA,servicemen than that who do not own their,81
NA,"own homes, but because of the waiting",81
NA,time and the procrastination by the Govern-,81
NA,"ment in making finance available, we find",81
NA,"that only 30 per cent, of eligible ex-servicefigures",81
NA,men are expected to make use of this legis-,81
NA,lation. The terms and conditions for home,81
NA,ownership are excellent and every ex-,81
NA,serviceman would avail himself of them if,81
NA,he could. This is proved by the fact that,81
NA,this bill has been brought down in order,81
NA,to curb the activities of certain people in,81
NA,certain States who have been taking advan-,81
NA,tage of the excellent conditions illegally.,81
NA,The War Service Homes Division should,81
NA,be able to make money available imme-,81
NA,"diately to every eligible applicant, whether",81
NA,"to buy an old home, to get a group home,",81
NA,"to build for himself, or to buy a new pro-",81
NA,perty. But this Government is not worried,81
NA,about that at all. Over the last half-dozen,81
NA,years it has made available for this purpose,81
NA,"£35,000,000 a year, and I will give the",81
NA,"House the average receipts from rentals,",81
NA,loan repayments and so on. The total,81
NA,"revenue in 1959-60 was about £19,000,000,",81
NA,so that in that year the Government's net,81
NA,contribution to war service homes was only,81
NA,"£16,000,000. In 1960-61 expenditure on",81
NA,"war service homes amounted to £35,041,819",81
NA,"and the receipts were £21,014,153, so that",81
NA,there was a total cost to the Government,81
NA,"of only £14,000,000. As receipts are",81
NA,increasing each year by approximately,81
NA,"£1,250,000, it will be only eleven years",81
NA,before the Government is receiving back,81
NA,"exactly the sum of £35,000,000 which it is",81
NA,paying out. So unless substantially,81
NA,increased finance is made available by the,81
NA,Government for war service homes we will,81
NA,find that in eleven years' time this item,81
NA,"will be self-balancing with £35,000,000",81
NA,being made available by the Government,81
NA,"and £35,000,000 coming back in the repay-",81
NA,"ment of instalments of loans, rents and",81
NA,so on.,81
NA,The Government's record in all types of,81
NA,"housing, whether through the Common-",81
NA,"wealth and State Housing Agreement, the",81
NA,Commonwealth Bank or the War Service,81
NA,"Homes Division, is one which must be",81
NA,deplored. Ex-servicemen are expected to,81
NA,"wait for many months for advances, and",81
NA,there has been no increase in the maximum,81
NA,loan for a number of years. The building,81
NA,"loan was increased from £2,000 to £2,750",81
NA,"in December, 1950. It was extended to",81
NA,"£2,750 for all forms of assistance in",81
NA,"November, 1954. If we look at the cost",81
NA,taken from the report of ihe War,81
NA,Service Homes Division and compare the,81
NA,average cost of dwellings and land in each,81
NA,"year, we find that in 1951-52, when the",81
NA,"loan was increased from £2,000 to £2,750,",81
NA,in New South Wales the average cost of,81
NA,houses to the War Service Homes Division,81
NA,"was £2,525, in Victoria £2,477 and in",81
NA,"Queensland £2,393.",81
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! The honorable,81
NA,member's time has expired.,81
Mr STOKES ,Maribyrnong) [9.0] -,81
NA,"During the past two or three weeks, in the",81
NA,"closing stages of this Parliament, we have",81
NA,seen the spectacle of the Opposition attempt-,81
NA,ing to make every use of the few matters,81
NA,"that might be considered contentious, which",81
NA,are of importance to certain sections of the,81
NA,"community, trying to make political capital",81
NA,out of every one of them.,81
NA,Mr Ward -Yo u are getting worried.,81
Mr STOKES , T am not worried. In,81
NA,"any case, remember that you will be only",81
NA,2-i-c. Many honorable members opposite,81
NA,are trying to interject. That is all right.,81
NA,I like to hear the dogs snarl when I throw,81
NA,a stone; when I hit a cur he yelps. The,81
NA,"honorable member for Lang ( Mr Stewart),",81
NA,following the pattern tha twe have seen,81
NA,developing over the past several weeks in,81
NA,respect of various issues,81
NA,Mr Daly -Kee p politics out of it.,81
Mr STOKES ,I t is a pity you did not,82
NA,go to Russia; they would have kept you,82
NA,there.,82
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! I think it will,82
NA,be better for all concerned if the honorable,82
NA,member addresses the Chair. I ask other,82
NA,honorable members to remain silent.,82
Mr STOKES , I shall endeavour to,82
NA,"back to the bill, Mr Speaker. The honor-",82
NA,able member for Lang has foreshadowed,82
NA,an amendment to the War Service Homes,82
NA,Bill which will seek to increase the maxithat,82
NA,mum amount of the loan available to an,82
NA,individual ex-serviceman. The amendment,82
NA,has been circulated among honorable,82
NA,members.,82
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! I point out,82
NA,that the honorable member made only passvidual,82
NA,ing reference to it. He intends to introduce,82
NA,it in committee.,82
Mr STOKES ,"Yes , but he said that the",82
NA,intention is to increase the maximum,82
NA,"amount of the loan to f3,500. I have no",82
NA,fault to find with the contention that there,82
NA,is an argument for increasing the amount,82
NA,of the loan for a war service home.,82
NA,"fact, there have been many occasions",82
NA,which ex-servicemen have had to withdraw,82
NA,"their applications, because in the period",82
NA,between making the applications and having,82
NA,the loans granted costs have increased to,82
NA,such an extent that their ready cash has,82
NA,proved insufficient to make up the difference,82
NA,between the maximum amount of the loan,82
NA,and the cost of house and land.,82
NA,Mr Reynolds -Yo u were condemning us,82
NA,a moment ago for raising this issue.,82
Mr STOKES ,"Jus t a moment; let me legislation,",82
NA,finish. I will come to you presently. To-day,82
NA,in Victoria an unimproved block of land,82
NA,"costs £800 to £1,000, and the cost of an",82
NA,"ordinary weatherboard home is from £3,750",82
NA,"to £4,000. In these circumstances an exappropriation",82
NA,"serviceman has to find about £2,000 to add",82
NA,"to his loan, or else he must take out",82
NA,second mortgage to cover the difference.,82
NA,he does this he will have to pay perhaps,82
NA,a week for from three to five years,82
NA,"charge the second mortgage, in addition",82
NA,his repayments on the original loan under,82
NA,the war service homes legislation. For the,82
NA,second mortgage he is charged a minimum,82
NA,"of 10 per cent, interest. For the three",82
NA,five years during which he repays his second,82
NA,mortgage he must meet interest payments on,82
NA,"the loan of £2,750 from the War Services",82
NA,"Homes Division, as well as interest pay-",82
NA,"ments at the rate of, say, 10 per cent, on",82
NA,"another £750 or more, so that until he has",82
NA,discharged the second mortgage he will be,82
NA,faced with an overall interest burden of,82
NA,"get about 6 per cent, on the total debt.",82
NA,I know that many ex-servicemen are,82
NA,struggling with these difficulties. I also know,82
NA,"the Government, when preparing the",82
NA,"recent Budget, decided to give the flagging",82
NA,building industry an impetus by spreading,82
NA,the amount of money available under the,82
NA,War Service Homes Act among as many,82
NA,applicants as possible. For this reason it,82
NA,retained the maximum ceiling for an indi-,82
NA,"loan at £2,750. This was one of the",82
NA,moves the Government made to assist the,82
NA,"economy, and I should not have thought that",82
NA,the Opposition would find fault with it.,82
NA,There is another aspect of this matter that,82
NA,the Opposition must take into account. The,82
NA,act provides that advances may be made to,82
NA,applicants who wish to discharge existing,82
NA,mortgages. These advances have been held,82
NA,In back for many years by administrative,82
NA,on action. By deciding to make advances of,82
NA,this kind and by deciding not to increase the,82
NA,"amount of the maximum individual loans,",82
NA,the Government has attempted to spread the,82
NA,"available money, amounting to £35,000,000,",82
NA,over a sufficient number of applicants to cut,82
NA,down substantially the time during which,82
NA,applicants wait for loans in respect of new,82
NA,homes to be granted.,82
NA,The honorable member for Lang knows,82
NA,that the provisions of the war serviee homes,82
NA,and the Government's intentions,82
NA,"in this field, have been fully discussed during",82
NA,the debate on the Estimates. He also knows,82
NA,that after a message has been received from,82
NA,the Governor-General recommending the,82
NA,of the amount stated in those,82
NA,"Estimates, any attempt to use a bill such as",82
NA,"a the one now before us, whicb simply seeks",82
NA,"If an administrative amendment, as a means for",82
NA,£5 proposing the amendment that the honorable,82
NA,to dismember has foreshadowed represents,82
NA,to another political trick. Honorable members,82
NA,opposite have enough knowledge of the pro-,82
NA,cedures of this House to realize that it is,82
NA,quite out of order to introduce such an,82
NA,to amendment. For this reason I say that I,82
NA,cannot support the amendment that has been,83
NA,"foreshadowed, although I may be in sym-",83
NA,pathy with the principles underlying it. It,83
NA,represents at this time nothing more than a,83
NA,cheap trick to make political capital on the,83
NA,eve of an election. I cannot go along with,83
NA,"such tactics, and for that reason alone I will",83
NA,not support the amendment. I would agree,83
NA,that a recommendation could be made to the,83
NA,Government to consider raising the amount,83
NA,of the maximum loan next year. I would,83
NA,go along with such a recommendation.,83
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! The honorable,83
NA,"member for Yarra, who is interjecting, is",83
NA,out of his place and is also out of order. I,83
NA,must ask the honorable members to main-,83
NA,tain silence.,83
Mr STOKES ,Th e reasons given for the,83
NA,introduction of this amending legislation are,83
NA,"two-fold. First, it is sought to regularize a",83
NA,practice that has been followed in the War,83
NA,Service Homes Division since 1933 of allow-,83
NA,ing borrowers to re-borrow any amounts that,83
NA,they may have repaid in excess of,83
NA,"those that they contracted to repay, for",83
NA,the purpose of meeting outgoings on their,83
NA,"property for repairs, alterations or additions.",83
NA,The second purpose of the legislation is to,83
NA,prevent ineligible persons from acquiring,83
NA,war service homes on the beneficial terms,83
NA,intended only to be enjoyed by eligible ex-,83
NA,servicemen and their dependants and by,83
NA,those in other categories provided for by the,83
NA,act.,83
NA,"With regard to the first reason, I am at",83
NA,some loss to understand why this amendment,83
NA,has been necessary in its present form. The,83
NA,act itself appears to me to make ample pro-,83
NA,vision to cover this aspect. Section 20(1.),83
NA,states-,83
NA,"Subject to this Act . . . the Director may,",83
NA,"upon application in writing, make an advance lo an",83
NA,"eligible person on the prescribed security, for the",83
NA,purpose of enabling him-,83
NA,(d) to complete a partially erected dwelling-,83
NA,house owned by him;,83
NA,(e) to enlarge a dwelling-house owned by,83
NA,him; - .,83
NA,Section 18A says-,83
NA,"(I.) The Director may, with the approval of",83
NA,"the Minister, enter inlo an arrangement-",83
NA,(a) for the making of roads or olher facilities,83
NA,affording access to dwelling-houses,83
NA,"acquired, erected or to be erected in",83
NA,pursuance of this Act;,83
NA,(b) for connecting any such dwelling-houses,83
NA,"with sewerage, drainage, water, gas",83
NA,and electric power and lighting systems;,83
NA,and,83
NA,(c) for establishing or extending such,83
NA,systems to connect with any such,83
NA,dwelling-houses;,83
NA,(2.) The cost allotted to a dwelling-house under,83
NA,this section shall not be included in reckoning,83
NA,the total amount which may be advanced under,83
NA,section twenty-one of this Act.,83
NA,(3.) The cost so allotted shall be a charge,83
NA,"against the purchaser of, or borrower in respect",83
NA,"of, the dwelling-house, and the Director may",83
NA,require him to refund the amount of that cost,83
NA,by such instalments as the Director determines.,83
NA,1 should have thought that these provisions,83
NA,would give the director power to make,83
NA,additional advances for these purposes from,83
NA,the moneys ordinarily available to him. I,83
NA,understand that it is now held that section,83
NA,18A is restricted to group undertakings by,83
NA,the War Service Homes Division and has,83
NA,no relation to individual applications for,83
NA,the purposes that I have mentioned.,83
NA,The Minister for Social Services ( Mr.,83
NA,"Roberton), in his second-reading speech,",83
NA,referred to the first of the two amendments,83
NA,to be made to the principal act by this bill,83
NA,in these terms-,83
NA,The first of these two matters concerns the,83
NA,principle lhat an ex-serviceman who makes pay-,83
NA,ments to the War Service Homes Division in,83
NA,excess of his instalment during the term of his,83
NA,"loan, may withdraw these excess amounts to",83
NA,"meet the normal costs of ownership, to carry",83
NA,"out repairs, make additions or alterations and",83
NA,conserve and increase his equity in his own,83
NA,property . . - -- - | -(j,83
NA,It has been the practice of the War Service,83
NA,Homes Division since 1933 to permit purchasers,83
NA,or borrowers to use the amounts accumulated,83
NA,to their credit for the payment of items of ex-,83
NA,penditure directly related to their property.,83
NA,"Under this practice, the owners of war service",83
NA,homes have been allowed to draw on their ex-,83
NA,"cess deposits to meet rates and taxes, to install",83
NA,"water, electric light, gas services and sewerage,",83
NA,to make alterations and additions to their proper-,83
NA,ties and to carry out repairs.,83
NA,This implies that the practice has extended,83
NA,only to borrowers who have accumu-,83
NA,lated excess funds and only to the extent,83
NA,of the funds that they have so accumu-,83
NA,"lated. I understand that, as a matter of",83
NA,"practice, this is not wholly the case and",83
NA,that individual borrowers may apply to the,83
NA,"division, regardless of whether or not they",83
NA,"have accumulated credits, and obtain",83
NA,additional advances to meet expenses such,83
NA,as have been mentioned and to make,83
NA,alterations and additions. The real core,83
NA,"of the matter appears to be the fact that,",83
NA,"in the main, these additional advances",84
NA,which it is now sought to regularize have,84
NA,been met from the funded total of these,84
NA,"accumulated credits, which the Minister",84
NA,"has said aggregate £4,127,326.",84
NA,Paragraph (c) of sub-section (2.) of,84
NA,tion 39 of the act states that there shall be,84
NA,credited to the War Service Homes Trust,84
NA,Account-,84
NA,"purchase money, repayments of advances, and",84
NA,all other moneys received by the Director . . .,84
NA,Paragraph (c) of sub-section (3.) provides,84
NA,that there shall be debited to the trust,84
NA,account-,84
NA,advances made by the Director in pursuance of,84
NA,this Act . . .,84
NA,It is all very well for the Minister to say-,84
NA,For many years ex-servicemen acquiring a,84
NA,war service home have been encouraged to make,84
NA,excess payments and it has been the custom to,84
NA,advise them that they may withdraw amounts,84
NA,from their accumulated credits to meet costs,84
NA,and charges directly related to the property.,84
NA,I want to leave with the House this thought:,84
NA,These accumulated funds do not seem,84
NA,likely to grow in the future. Who will be,84
NA,concerned about placing money on deposit,84
NA,in excess of instalments at an interest rate,84
NA,"of 3 i per cent., when, even from the State",84
NA,Savings Bank of Victoria one can get 4,84
NA,"per cent, on deposits at call? I f one cares",84
NA,to deposit money with other institutions at,84
NA,"call, one can get even higher rates, and the",84
NA,attractive rates offered for specified terms,84
NA,for the present special Commonwealth,84
NA,bonds and other trustee investments make,84
NA,it likely that few would consider accumu-,84
NA,lating excess payments on which the War,84
NA,Service Homes Division would pay interest,84
NA,at only 31 per cent.,84
NA,The Minister said also-,84
NA,"Each year approximately 4,000 persons draw",84
NA,on their accumulated credits for the payment of,84
NA,rales and 500 or more use their credits to make,84
NA,additions and extensions to their homes.,84
NA,I wonder whether this practice may have,84
NA,to cease if future demands exceed trie total,84
NA,of these accumulated credits. I suggest,84
NA,"that the amendment of section 18A, the",84
NA,"terms of which I have read to the House,",84
NA,"to empower the director, at his discretion,",84
NA,to make additional advances from the War,84
NA,Service Homes Trust Account for the pre-,84
NA,scribed purposes to which these accumulated,84
NA,credits can properly be applied under the,84
NA,"terms of section 39, would represent a far",84
NA,better approach to the matter than does the,84
NA,amendment proposed in this bill now,84
NA,before us.,84
NA,Let me turn now to the second amend-,84
NA,ment to the act to be made by this bill.,84
NA,sec- This amendment will have the effect of,84
NA,absolutely prohibiting the transfer of a war,84
NA,service home to an ineligible person. It,84
NA,has been explained that section 35 of the,84
NA,act gives the Director of War Service,84
NA,Homes power to give or withhold his con-,84
NA,"sent to a transfer to an ineligible person,",84
NA,"having regard to certain conditions specified,",84
NA,one of which is that the transfer shall be,84
NA,in the interests of the transferor-th e ex-,84
NA,serviceman borrower. It is claimed that,84
NA,certain conveyancing devices are being used,84
NA,to circumvent this section and to obtain,84
NA,the director's consent to a transfer to an,84
NA,ineligible person so that that person may,84
NA,"enjoy the benefits of the act, including the",84
NA,"concessional rate of interest, although, on",84
NA,"the face of it, the eligible ex-serviceman",84
NA,borrower legally remains the party contract-,84
NA,"ing with the director. This practice, it is",84
NA,"said, is growing. The Minister stated-",84
NA,. . . agents are now openly advertising for war,84
NA,service homes with existing loans.,84
NA,Section 50A (2.) makes it an offence to use,84
NA,"in advertising the words "" war service",84
NA,"homes"", or any words nearly resembling",84
NA,them which are likely to deceive.,84
NA,Apparently this provision is not being used,84
NA,"to restrict the practice. On the other hand,",84
NA,if this provision is considered to be ineffec-,84
NA,"tive, we ought to see in this bill a pro-",84
NA,vision designed to strengthen the one in,84
NA,"section 50A (2.), but the bill contains no",84
NA,such provision.,84
NA,Mr Daly -Wh y does not the honorable,84
NA,member finish on that note?,84
Mr STOKES , I shall finish the honor-,84
NA,able member if he is not careful. The,84
NA,Minister stated that these conveyancing,84
NA,arrangements that I have mentioned operate,84
NA,through an agreement-,84
NA,which allows the ineligible purchaser to take,84
NA,occupation of the home and to pay off the balance,84
NA,of the loan to the division over the remainder,84
NA,of the term.,84
NA,He went on-,84
NA,Various kinds of arrangements have come to,84
NA,"notice, some of which constitute a sale on terms",84
NA,of the interest of the purchaser or borrower.,84
NA,"Others, in substance, amount to an agreement",85
NA,"to let the home, coupled with an option to pur-",85
NA,chase.,85
NA,NA,85
NA,able member on?,85
Mr STOKES , I am on the side of,85
NA,"justice, as always. Let us take a closer",85
NA,"look at some of these conveyancing devices,",85
NA,Mr Speaker. It must be quite apparent,85
NA,that one of them is a straightout sale of,85
NA,the borrower's equity subject to the pur-,85
NA,chaser taking over the division's mortgage.,85
NA,"In this case, the title to the property",85
NA,remains in the name of the original bor-,85
NA,"rower, subject to the registered mortgage",85
NA,"to the division, and the documents are held",85
NA,by the division. In a smaller number of,85
NA,transactions where a contract of sale,85
NA,between the division and the eligible per-,85
NA,"son exists, the title is in the name of the",85
NA,Director of War Service Homes and is held,85
NA,"by the Division. Therefore, any ineligible",85
NA,purchaser desiring to circumvent section,85
NA,35 cannot obtain the security of any regis-,85
NA,tered recognition of his interest in the pro-,85
NA,"perty, but must have recourse only to an",85
NA,unregistered agreement. This agreement,85
NA,could take the form of an assignment of,85
NA,the equity of redemption of the original,85
NA,"contracting party with the division, to the",85
NA,"ineligible purchaser, accompanied by a",85
NA,transfer of title to be held in escrow. When,85
NA,this type of conveyance is used in similar,85
NA,transactions outside the division the pur-,85
NA,chaser usually can obtain some protection,85
NA,by registering a caveat against the title to,85
NA,protect his interests. But to avoid dis-,85
NA,closure to the director even this protection,85
NA,must be forgone by the ineligible pur-,85
NA,chaser whom this amendment seeks to,85
NA,exclude. Although there may be an ulti-,85
NA,mate benefit to the purchaser in the saving,85
NA,"of several hundreds of pounds in interest,",85
NA,"over the long term, I doubt whether any",85
NA,solicitor acting in such a case would advise,85
NA,a client to place his cash payment of,85
NA,"possibly £1,000 in such jeopardy without",85
NA,registered protection. We are told that this,85
NA,practice is flourishing.,85
NA,The second method is a contract of sale,85
NA,on terms. I feel that this type of trans-,85
NA,action would be the one more normally,85
NA,used and could take at least two main,85
NA,forms. One of these would be where the,85
NA,"term is expressed in the contract at three,",85
NA,"five or seven years, and the purchaser signs",85
NA,a contract to pay a deposit and make weekly,85
NA,or monthly repayments of the balance of the,85
NA,"purchase money, to include interest at cur-",85
NA,"rent rates, and embodying a clause declaring",85
NA,the mortgage to the War Service Homes,85
NA,Division and an undertaking by the vendor,85
NA,to maintain the mortgage repayments until,85
NA,such time as the vendor's equity has been,85
NA,satisfied and then to apply all repayments up,85
NA,to the due date of the contract in reduction,85
NA,of the mortgage until final settlement-,85
NA,should this position arise. Normally at final,85
NA,settlement on termination of the contract,85
NA,there would still be some moneys owing to,85
NA,the vendor in addition to the balance owing,85
NA,under the mortgage.,85
NA,"At the present time the director, if applied",85
NA,to and if satisfied in accordance with the,85
NA,"conditions laid down in section 35, would",85
NA,normally give his consent. A main factor in,85
NA,these conditions is that he must be satisfied,85
NA,that the transaction is in the best interests of,85
NA,"the transferor-tha t is, the original borrower.",85
NA,Another factor outside those conditions,85
NA,would be that the division was obtaining a,85
NA,much earlier repayment of the debt-no t in,85
NA,"45 years, but in three, five or seven years.",85
NA,What are the best interests of the transferor?,85
NA,"First, let us examine some of the reasons",85
NA,for a war service loan recipient requiring,85
NA,to sell his home. They could include that he,85
NA,wanted to make a profit; that he had been,85
NA,permanently transferred to some other part,85
NA,of a State; or interstate or overseas; that,85
NA,his family had grown beyond the capacity of,85
NA,his original home and that additions to that,85
NA,home were physically or economically im-,85
NA,practicable; that he or some member of his,85
NA,family was suffering from chronic illness,85
NA,which necessitated a change of climate. If,85
NA,"he can sell for cash no problem arises, but if",85
NA,he is compelled to sell on terms in order to,85
NA,effect a reasonably quick sale which may be,85
NA,"dictated by business reasons or health, then",85
NA,this is the only avenue.,85
NA,Many people will say that this is second,85
NA,assistance. Others will ask why he should,85
NA,"get 7 per cent, on the amount of the mort-",85
NA,gage covered by the balance of the purchase,85
NA,money when he himself is paying the divi-,85
NA,sion only 3 i per cent. Do not let us get,85
NA,this wrong. He is forced to purchase an-,85
NA,other home on similar terms to those on,85
NA,"which he sold his original home, paying the",85
NA,same terms-inflated price and the same inendeavours,86
NA,"creased rate of interest. Further, he is",86
NA,"getting second assistance. True,",86
NA,"getting another home, but the assistance",86
NA,way of repatriation benefit has not altered.,86
NA,He still has only the one repatriation bene-,86
NA,"fit. In fact, he has forgone that benefit",86
NA,entering into another private contract for,86
NA,the home that necessity has compelled,86
NA,him to acquire on shorter terms and higher,86
NA,interest than he originally enjoyed. Is he,86
NA,not still an eligible ex-serviceman whom the,86
NA,act has the intention to assist in the acquisi-,86
NA,tion of a home?,86
NA,I have no feeling of tenderness whatsoare,86
NA,ever for people indulging in illicit,86
NA,"actions for profit, and I concede that it",86
NA,difficult to accept pleas of ignorance of,86
NA,regulations in extenuation. But I was,86
NA,originally concerned when it appeared to,86
NA,me from the words that the Minister used electorate.,86
NA,in his second-reading speech that all deal-,86
NA,ings other than leases or mortgages would,86
NA,come within the scope of this amendment,86
NA,lo the detriment of the ex-serviceman,86
NA,pelled to sell his first home for business,86
NA,family reasons on a proper contract of sale,86
NA,on terms-whic h transaction had been,86
NA,properly submitted to the director for his,86
NA,consent under section 35 (I.) (c)-an d the,86
NA,granting of which consent is governed,86
NA,"section 35 (2.) (b) where the proposed transFebruary,",86
NA,"feree is not an eligible person, and where",86
NA,main consideration is lhat the transaction,86
NA,in the interests of the transferor. I am,86
NA,pieased to say that the Attorney-General ( Sir,86
NA,Garfield Barwick) has assured me that these,86
NA,additional powers will in no wise limit the,86
NA,ability of the director to exercise his dis-,86
NA,cretion on the conditions set forth in section,86
NA,35 and give consent where it is considered,86
NA,proper to a disposal of the property to,86
NA,ineligible person without the necessity of,86
NA,calling up the original loan until completion,86
NA,of the sale. I accept this assurance and. apart,86
NA,"from the points 1 have criticized, I am time.",86
NA,perfectly satisfied that the director and,86
NA,Minister will apply these additional powers,86
NA,"justly and with equity, and that the bill",86
NA,another measure which is satisfactory,86
NA,in all the circumstances.,86
NA,NA,86
NA,it will be generally agreed by all honorable,86
NA,members that whenever a measure affecting,86
NA,the welfare of ex-servicemen is brought,86
NA,before the Parliament I always use my best,86
NA,to keep the discussion on fairly,86
NA,not reasonable non-party lines. 1 think that,86
NA,he is that is an attitude that should be main-,86
NA,by tained as far as possible.,86
NA,I note that in this bill there are references,86
NA,"by to rates, taxes or charges on or in respect",86
NA,"of the land, the erection of any building or",86
NA,"any structure on the land, the carrying out",86
NA,"of improvements on, to or in relation to",86
NA,"the land, the dwelling house or any other",86
NA,"building or structure on the land, the repair,",86
NA,"maintenance, alteration or extension of the",86
NA,dwelling house or any other building or,86
NA,"structure on the land, and so forth. They",86
NA,all related to the purposes for which,86
NA,transloan moneys may be advanced by the,86
NA,is director. My speech will be related to all,86
NA,the these matters. Here is the situation as I,86
NA,see it. 1. submit the facts concerning faults,86
NA,that have developed in a home in the Lalor,86
NA,The building allotment was purchased by,86
NA,an ex-soldier. The War Service Homes,86
NA,comDivision inspected the land and sank two,86
NA,or holes in a soil stability test. The division,86
NA,"approved the site, provided plans and speci-",86
NA,fications and let a contract. The house is,86
NA,small; it is of 9 squares It is of timber,86
NA,frame set on concrete stumps and sole pads.,86
NA,by The owner went into occupancy in,86
NA,1956. The position now is that,86
NA,the structurally the house is a shambles. The,86
NA,is foundations have subsided from 1 to 3 i,86
NA,inches and as a result the timber frame is,86
NA,severely twisted. Windows will not close,86
NA,and doors jam.,86
NA,The owner has said that he first suspected,86
NA,trouble about fifteen months after occu-,86
NA,pancy and informed the division's officers to,86
NA,"an that effect. On 1st March, 1960, the owner",86
NA,wrote to the division and said he would like,86
NA,an inspection. He said the house was sink-,86
NA,ing and had been slightly that way for some,86
NA,He had not been able to close,86
NA,the doors and he had put brick supports under,86
NA,"the house. On 25th August, 1960, the divi-",86
NA,is sion informed the owner by letter that cer-,86
NA,tain repairs were required at the owner's,86
NA,expense. The first was to jack up the,86
NA,bearers until the floors were level. Not a,86
NA,word was said about the twisted house,86
NA,"frame. On 12th December, 1960, the divi-",86
NA,sion informed the owner by letter that the,86
NA,cost of foundation repairs would reach,86
NA,three figures. I have refrained from stating,86
NA,the figures because the work is the subject,87
NA,of tender. No mention was made of the,87
NA,cost of restoring the twisted framework to,87
NA,normality. No allegation of any conse-,87
NA,quence has been made by the division that,87
NA,the owner has contributed to the present,87
NA,state of the building except that he had,87
NA,filled land on each side of the house to a,87
NA,higher level than the under-floor level. This,87
NA,is of no material consequence. The filling did,87
NA,not amount to more than 2 inches and,87
NA,thousands of home owners have adopted,87
NA,the same practice without any damaging,87
NA,effect. Any effect could be of only the,87
NA,most minute character. It is a paltry excuse.,87
NA,I point out to the House that section 20,87
NA,of the War Service Homes Act gives the,87
NA,Director of the War Service Homes Division,87
NA,authority to make an advance from loans,87
NA,to an eligible person to erect a dwelling,87
NA,house on the holding of an applicant. That,87
NA,applies to this case. Section 24 requires,87
NA,the director to be satisfied that the house,87
NA,when erected is substantial and durable.,87
NA,This house is not substantial and durable.,87
NA,"On 1st March, 1960, the director wrote to",87
NA,me and I now give a summary of the,87
NA,letter's contents. He stated that the imme-,87
NA,diate cause of the subsidence seemed to be,87
NA,a subsidence of the area under the floor of,87
NA,the house and the sinking of the stumps,87
NA,from two to three inches and added-,87
NA,The movement of the foundations appears to be,87
NA,primarily due to excessive movement of the soil,87
NA,to which the district is subject. Similar failures,87
NA,the district caused the local council considerable,87
NA,concern.,87
NA,The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Re-,87
NA,search Organization advised the council that,87
NA,seasonal changes caused a movement of the soil,87
NA,in the district which varied the contour of the land,87
NA,to the extent of five to seven inches. The council,87
NA,expressed the view that the type of foundations,87
NA,specified by the division should normally have,87
NA,sufficed.,87
NA,The peculiarities of the soil have,87
NA,by surface drainage from the adjacent allot-,87
NA,ments; and also the owner's action in filling the,87
NA,land on each side of the house to a higher level,87
NA,than the underfloor area.,87
NA,The director stated that it seemed that sary,87
NA,these factors combined to cause some settledrains,87
NA,ment of the house. If all these reasons given,87
NA,"by the director are correct, it is quite eviused",87
NA,dent that the director was not,87
NA,being satisfied that the house when erected,87
NA,would be substantial and durable as rethe,87
NA,quired by paragraph (a) of section 24.,87
NA,ghastly mistake was made if these excuses,87
NA,are tenable.,87
NA,I point out that the opinion of the local,87
NA,"council officers, which included the opinion",87
NA,"of the C.S.I.R.O., was not obtained until",87
NA,after I first made representations on 10th,87
NA,"October, 1960. This was confirmed in writ-",87
NA,ing by the Assistant Building Surveyor of,87
NA,the Footscray City Council to the War Ser-,87
NA,"vice Homes Division on 3rd February, 1961.",87
NA,The area concerned is basaltic country and,87
NA,requires extra care in regard to drainage,87
NA,and foundation installations. The division,87
NA,was too late in obtaining information about,87
NA,this district's soils. It got no information,87
NA,about the soil and what would happen on,87
NA,this site until I informed the director that,87
NA,there was trouble afoot. Then it called on,87
NA,the Assistant City Surveyor of Footscray to,87
NA,have a consultation on the site. On 3rd,87
NA,"February, this information about what the",87
NA,C.S.I.R.O. thinks of the soil in the district,87
NA,"was obtained. In those circumstances, how",87
NA,could the director expect to be forewarned,87
NA,when the house was built in 1956-57? Why,87
NA,did not the division get an opinion on the,87
NA,soils at that period? That is the question.,87
NA,Everybody makes mistakes but the ghastly,87
NA,feature of this case is that those who made,87
NA,the mistakes will not admit that a mistake,87
NA,was made and will not bear the cost of,87
NA,the essential repairs.,87
NA,Let us examine the drainage factor.,87
NA,in Under the uniform drainage regulations,87
NA,quoted by the division there is this reference,87
NA,to building on land without proper means,87
NA,of drainage as happened in this case-,87
NA,No building intended or adapted to be used,87
NA,wholly or partly for residential purposes shall be,87
NA,constructed upon land which cannot at all times,87
NA,be efficiently drained by gravitation into some,87
NA,"adjoining street, channel or drainage easement,",87
NA,"onto, through, or over which such drainage may",87
NA,been aggravated lawfully be discharged.,87
NA,Another section of the regulations dealing,87
NA,with subsoil drainage states-,87
NA,Where the Surveyor considers such action neces-,87
NA,the subsoil at the site of any new building,87
NA,shall be drained by means of a system of subsoil,87
NA,"properly laid to an approved outfall. Ti,e",87
NA,layout and type of drains and the methods to be,87
NA,for disposing of the subsoil water shall be,87
NA,justified in approved by the Surveyor.,87
NA,I take it that that refers to a surveyor of,87
NA,local municipality because the War Ser-,87
NA,So a vice Homes Division is not bound by the,87
NA,laws of the State or the municipality al-,88
NA,though it tries to observe them. The fact,88
NA,is that there is not a solitary subsoil drain,88
NA,on the property. At no stage has the ex-,88
NA,serviceman been informed that he should,88
NA,"put them in, and the division's asset was",88
NA,not protected as it should have been. The,88
NA,division also stated that one of the causes,88
NA,of the house being practically wrecked was,88
NA,the drainage factor and seepage from the,88
NA,adjoining block. It was obvious that it was,88
NA,a low-lying block. If the division had ob-,88
NA,tained information from the surveyor in,88
NA,"the first place, then this might not have",88
NA,"happened. On 12th December, 1960, the",88
NA,division stated in a letter to me-,88
NA,The stump foundations are adequate having,88
NA,gard to the nature of the subsoil.,88
NA,"If the stumps were adequate having ever,",88
NA,regard to the nature of the subsoil which,88
NA,"said to be causing the trouble, why did",88
NA,house go down 3 i inches? Paragraph,88
NA,(b) of section 24 of the act requires the,88
NA,director to be satisfied that the plans and,88
NA,specifications of the dwelling house comply,88
NA,with the prescribed conditions and have,88
NA,been approved by the director. I have here,88
NA,the plans and specifications. My comment,88
NA,is that the division provided the plans and,88
NA,specifications and let the contract. There,88
NA,is a serious conflict between the plans,88
NA,the written specifications. They do not,88
NA,comply with the division's own regulations.,88
NA,These regulations require that each plan,88
NA,"shall show a plan of the building, section",88
NA,and two elevations. Every specification,88
NA,shall clearly describe the whole of the work,88
NA,required for carrying out the construction,88
NA,of the building. Let us look at the specifactory.,88
NA,fication. The elevation plan shows that the,88
NA,overall depth of the sole plate for the stumps,88
NA,"shall be 2 feet, but when it comes to clearly",88
NA,"defining the work, as required in the divime",88
NA,"sion's regulations, we find that the stump",88
NA,sump shall be 2 feet under the ground,88
NA,face and stumps shall be supported on 9-in.,88
NA,by 9-in. by 6-in. concrete bases cast in,88
NA,So we have 2 feet of the stump underground,88
NA,"and 6 inches of the sole plate, making",88
NA,total of 2 ft. 6 in. The elevation away;,88
NA,plan requires an overall depth of 2 feet;,88
NA,so the elevation plan is in conflict with the department.,88
NA,written specification. The written speci-,88
NA,"fication, therefore, does not clearly describe",88
NA,the plan dimensions.,88
NA,"In these circumstances, what did the",88
NA,tractor do? He took the easy course and,88
NA,he put his stumps and sole plates down,88
NA,"2 feet overall instead of 2 ft. 6 in., as should",88
NA,have been clearly required by the written,88
NA,"specification. This is a faulty specification,",88
NA,and the best proof of this is that it has been,88
NA,withdrawn from use or amended to make,88
NA,it uniform in every respect.,88
NA,Paragraph (c) of section 24 requires the,88
NA,director to have regard to the locality in,88
NA,which the dwelling house is erected or,88
NA,proposed to be erected and to ensure that,88
NA,the risk is a reasonable risk for him to take.,88
NA,"As I said before, any one can make a mis-",88
NA,"take, but no inquiry was made as to the",88
NA,peculiarities of the district. Only two holes,88
NA,were sunk to ascertain whether the soil,88
NA,rewas all right. I deny that the soil was at,88
NA,"fault, although this is difficult soil. How-",88
NA,"if the soil was at fault, why is it that",88
NA,is no other house of the same vintage in this,88
NA,the tightly packed district has had the same,88
NA,trouble as this house has? My search of,88
NA,the district reveals that this is the only,88
NA,house to have this trouble. If the soil was,88
NA,"bad, other houses in the district similarly",88
NA,situated should have developed the faults,88
NA,and failures that this house developed. As,88
NA,"they did not, we must look further afield.",88
NA,"On 6th March, 1961, the director tele-",88
NA,phoned me. I believe he is a very honest,88
NA,and man. He suggested I might meet him and,88
NA,"talk the matter over, and that I should",88
NA,furnish any other information I might have.,88
NA,He suggested that we appoint an achitect,88
NA,arbitrator from a panel of architects. I,88
NA,intimated that I did not favour the idea.,88
NA,He then suggested that a builders' panel be,88
NA,appointed. I said that would not be satis-,88
NA,1 asked him whether I could have,88
NA,the plans and specifications and he agreed.,88
NA,"After a reminder, I received them eighteen",88
NA,days later. The director offered to permit,88
NA,to inspect the owner's file on that day.,88
NA,I thanked him and said I did not think,88
NA,"surI would require it. Subsequently, after I",88
NA,"had inspected the plans and specification,",88
NA,situ. the Minister for National Development,88
NA,(Senator Spooner) refused to allow me to,88
NA,a inspect the file. I did not want to take it,88
NA,I wanted to inspect it in his office,88
NA,under the supervision of an officer of his,88
NA,Let us return to the plans and specifica-,88
NA,tion. They provide that the stumps shall,88
NA,be sunk 2 feet under the surface of the,88
NA,conground and be supported on 9-in. by 9-in.,88
NA,by 6-in. concrete bases cast in situ. The,88
NA,6 inches refers to the depth. Honorable,89
NA,members should note that the important,89
NA,proviso is that stumps shall be supported,89
NA,on 6-in. concrete bases. This would give,89
NA,an overall depth of 2 ft. 6 in. During,89
NA,"March, 1961, I extracted a stump with",89
NA,sole plate attached from a position near the,89
NA,centre of the house. I have it here for,89
NA,inspection. It came from the point of,89
NA,greatest house subsidence. The under sur-,89
NA,face of the sole pad clearly indicates that,89
NA,the concrete from which it is formed had,89
NA,been poured into an unclean excavation and,89
NA,on to unpacked loose earth. It will not,89
NA,stand up straight on its own base; it is a,89
NA,botch. What do we find about it? The,89
NA,uniform building regulations require that,89
NA,24 hours' notice in writing shall be given,89
NA,to the surveyor when excavations or foun-,89
NA,dations are ready for inspection and that,89
NA,no footing shall be placed in position until,89
NA,the excavations have been inspected and,89
NA,approved by the surveyor.,89
NA,When asked in the Minister's presence,89
NA,whether the division had the contractor's,89
NA,"written notice in its possession, the director",89
NA,failed to reply. He did not tell a lie; he is,89
NA,an honest man. In the absence of the right,89
NA,"to peruse the file, I do not believe that the",89
NA,division has the contractor's written notice,89
NA,"of readiness to pour the concrete, and that",89
NA,is why we have a botch like this. I know,89
NA,a little about building and I know a little,89
NA,about post hole borers. The post holes for,89
NA,this job were formed with an ordinary,89
NA,mechanical-driven farm post hole borer.,89
NA,Every one knows that when the auger,89
NA,"pulled out of the earth, loose earth falls chief architect.",89
NA,back into the hole. Any one who knows reads-,89
NA,anything about fencing knows that the loose,89
NA,soil must either be taken out or rammed. visited,89
NA,"I f you put the post on to the loose soil, it is",89
NA,more than likely that the post will eventually,89
NA,subside. It is my belief that the holes were,89
NA,never inspected and that the notice is not on,89
NA,"the file. Besides the nature of the soil, the",89
NA,major cause of the trouble is the very innor,89
NA,ferior work in installing the sole plates.,89
NA,haps this is one of the reasons why I have,89
NA,been refused permission to inspect the,89
NA,"In my opinion, lack of specification stump",89
NA,depth is one of the major causes of foundaof,89
NA,tion subsidence. The unevenness of the that,89
NA,"degree of subsidence-tha t is,",89
NA,3 i in -i s due to more loose earth in some,89
NA,holes than in others. When the weight of,89
NA,"the house was imposed on the stumps, the",89
NA,loose earth was compacted and the subsi-,89
NA,dence continued until solidity of the soil,89
NA,was established.,89
NA,I made a rough sketch of the stump and,89
NA,pad and marked dimensions on it. I secured,89
NA,an interview with the Minister and explained,89
NA,my belief that the sole pad holes had been,89
NA,"dug with a post hole borer, that the holes",89
NA,were unclean and that this had caused the,89
NA,misshapen sole pad base. The Minister,89
NA,asked me to leave the sketch with him and,89
NA,"promised to contact me again. On 4th April,",89
NA,"the Minister wrote to me, returning the",89
NA,sketch I had given him. He provided a,89
NA,departmental sketch with dimensions which,89
NA,were in complete agreement with the dimen-,89
NA,sions on my sketch. This sketch is im-,89
NA,"portant, and I will show why in a moment.",89
NA,The Minister stated that the chief architect,89
NA,and another technical officer had again,89
NA,visited the house. He said that the stump,89
NA,and pad I had referred to were closely,89
NA,examined and that the drawing he enclosed,89
NA,showed what was found. The chief archi-,89
NA,tect reported to the Minister that the bottom,89
NA,of the concrete pad was not flat and the,89
NA,stump was 1 inch off centre. It provided,89
NA,more than the bearing surface required by,89
NA,the specification and by the controlling coun-,89
NA,cil. But what is the use of a wider sole,89
NA,plate base if it is placed on unpacked and,89
NA,loose earth. Subsidence is just as great as,89
NA,it would be if the base was of a smaller,89
NA,size.,89
NA,"We all make mistakes, but I cannot under-",89
NA,is stand why this mistake was made by the,89
NA,The Minister's letter,89
NA,The Chief Architect and another technical officer,89
NA,the owner's property and closely examined,89
NA,the stump and its pad. The Chief Architect states,89
NA,that the unevenness of the base of the concrete,89
NA,pad has been caused by the hammering of the,89
NA,concrete stump into the green concrete to gain,89
NA,its proper level. This is common practice. The,89
NA,extent of the unevenness found is not abnormal,89
NA,could it be considered faulty construction.,89
NA,"Likewise, the fact the stump is one inch off centre",89
NA,Percould not be considered faulty construction.,89
NA,file. The architect's report to the Minister,89
NA,continues-,89
NA,It was known ever since the first inspection,89
NA,the house that there was a space between the,89
NA,top of the stump and the bearer. This indicates,89
NA,the stump has not settled by reason of any,89
NA,from 1 in. to load imposed upon it.,89
NA,The plain fact is that if there had been,89
NA,a further depth of six inches of concrete,89
NA,"as provided in the written specifications, it",90
NA,might have stood up to the weight of the,90
NA,bearer better. If it had had a firm base,90
NA,"plate under it, it might have been able to",90
NA,retain its proper position. The stump,90
NA,which I have brought into the chamber,90
NA,is the offending stump.,90
NA,I was amazed at the chief architect's,90
NA,explanation of the cause of the unevenness,90
NA,"of the base of the concrete pads, as well",90
NA,"as other statements he made, so I wrote",90
NA,a submission to the Minister in which I,90
NA,said-,90
NA,I note the remarks of the chief architect,90
NA,following his examination of the extracted stump,90
NA,and its sole plate. My examination of the stump,90
NA,and sole plate to-day revealed it as a greater,90
NA,botch than I considered it to be when I previously,90
NA,examined it. It appears reasonable to believe,90
NA,that olher slumps may be as bad or even worse.,90
NA,The chief architect's statement that the uneven-,90
NA,ness of the base of the concrete pad has been,90
NA,caused by the hammering of the concrete stump,90
NA,into the green concrete is untenable.,90
NA,"I now say that it is incomprehensible,",90
NA,"that it indicates either incompetence,",90
NA,"stupidity, or something worse because any",90
NA,honorable member with intelligence who,90
NA,cares to inspect the stump I have produced,90
NA,cannot but be convinced that my conten-,90
NA,tion is right. I went on to say-,90
NA,It is evident that six inches of concrete were,90
NA,poured into the foundation hole. The 4 inches,90
NA,by 4 inches concrete stump 2 feet 6 inches long was,90
NA,"then placed on, or maybe into the concrete lo a",90
NA,depth not exceeding 1 inch; little or no hammer-,90
NA,ing being required. Afler the placing of the,90
NA,stump in position a further 6 inches of concrete,90
NA,was poured on top of the sole plate and sur-,90
NA,rounding the stump.,90
NA,I also stated-,90
NA,"If the chief architect disputes this, I",90
NA,the extracted sole plate be broken open. This,90
NA,would reveal the correctness of my diagnosis.,90
NA,"I asserted that, even if it were accepted",90
NA,that the stump was hammered into the,90
NA,"green concrete, it would not have produced",90
NA,the unevenness of the concrete base or,90
NA,pad. I said that I would readily arrange,90
NA,a test to prove my assertions. My challenge,90
NA,was not accepted. The chief architect,90
NA,visited the place several times but never,90
NA,broke open the sole plate. I dug into it,90
NA,with a gad to ascertain whether my con-,90
NA,"tention was right, and it was proved to be",90
NA,correct. The division's own sketch that,90
NA,was supplied by the Minister to me shows,90
NA,that six inches of concrete was poured into,90
NA,the hole. The stump was sat on top of,90
NA,that six inches of concrete then another,90
NA,"six inches of concrete was run around it, as",90
NA,"was required by the specifications, and",90
NA,there was no hammering of the stump into,90
NA,the green concrete. Following the giving,90
NA,"of that incorrect information by that man,",90
NA,I am unable-an d so is the owner-t o,90
NA,give any credence to all the letters that,90
NA,"have been written since, dictated by either",90
NA,"the director or the Minister, but certainly",90
NA,"signed without question by the Minister,",90
NA,offering excuses for denying this soldier,90
NA,the justice of paying to him the full cost,90
NA,"of restoring his home to a durable, sound",90
NA,condition.,90
NA,It is true that the owner was offered an,90
NA,"architect from a panel of architects, but is",90
NA,it fair to expect one architect to sit in,90
NA,judgment of another architect? I made,90
NA,"my statement to the Minister on, I think,",90
NA,"10th April, and it took him fifteen weeks",90
NA,to answer it. Then it was revealed that the,90
NA,Public Works Department had been put on,90
NA,to the job to make what was called an,90
NA,independent investigation. When 1 was,90
NA,"told this in a letter by the Minister, I sent",90
NA,a telegram to the Minister asking for access,90
NA,to this soldier's file. I asked the Minister,90
NA,to make available to me the report of the,90
NA,Public Works Department. The Minister,90
NA,refused to make it available. I then inter-,90
NA,viewed the Minister and asked for the,90
NA,"report, but again I was refused. How can",90
NA,an investigation be independent if the,90
NA,complainant is not told what the terms of,90
NA,"reference are, and if he is not supplied with",90
NA,the reports of the people who make the,90
NA,investigation? It is nonsense to suggest,90
NA,that it could be independent in those,90
NA,"suggest circumstances. What is even worse, the",90
NA,man who acted for the Minister in con-,90
NA,sulting with the Public Works Department,90
NA,was the man whose judgment was under,90
NA,challenge in connexion with this rotten,90
NA,job. 1 say that the reputation of this,90
NA,"Government is al stake, and I suggest that",90
NA,an investigation be made by a judicial,90
NA,"officer, not', by an architect. Nor should",90
NA,"it be maqV' by an allied department, in",90
NA,which there may or may not be friends of,90
NA,ihe man whose supervision of the work,90
NA,is under challenge.,90
NA,I can only say that the unfortunate,90
NA,people concerned are worthy citizens. An,90
NA,offer of a further loan was made to these,90
NA,people to repair the house. But these,90
NA,"repairs will cost a good deal of money,",91
NA,and if a loan is accepted these people will,91
NA,be saddled with a heavy interest burden,91
NA,"for many years. The division said, "" We",91
NA,are prepared to consider giving the owner,91
NA,"another loan of £2,730 if he sells his",91
NA,"home on the open market"". Fancy asking",91
NA,a man to sell a crook home on the open,91
NA,market! Could he sell it honestly without,91
NA,telling people of its faults? Who wants,91
NA,"to buy a home that has to be jacked up,",91
NA,and the studs of which are what is called,91
NA,racked? Every stud at the front of the,91
NA,dwelling is leaning so much that the win-,91
NA,dows cannot be shut. This condition,91
NA,cannot be rectified without pulling off all,91
NA,"the plaster, taking away the cross timbering",91
NA,and pulling the studs back into position.,91
NA,"This man has no motor car although,",91
NA,"being a skilled labourer, he has built",91
NA,nice garage which he is using as a workthat,91
NA,shop. The way in which the place is kept is,91
NA,credit to him. The only allegation m.adc,91
NA,against him is that he put some dirt against,91
NA,a skirting board at a place where he wanted,91
NA,to grow some pansies. He is suffering what,91
NA,I consider to be a frightful injustice.,91
NA,is being treated in a most un-British,91
NA,ner. He is being treated in this way,91
NA,because the Minister in control of this describes,91
NA,"partment refers matters such as this,",91
NA,"concern little men, to his officer, his adviser,",91
NA,whose advice I have proved to be false.,91
NA,I have all the evidence here. The letment.,91
NA,ters are available to the press of Australia,91
NA,or to any truly independent tribunal. This,91
NA,is an outrageous state of affairs. Fancy,91
NA,wanting the man to get out of the house,91
NA,which he treasures! His wife was born,91
NA,in the district and loves the area.,91
NA,"the department says, "" We will give you",91
NA,a loan to repair something for which you,91
NA,"are not responsible "". In my opinion, the",91
NA,division is largely responsible for the,91
NA,trouble because it did not take steps to,91
NA,ascertain the peculiarities of,91
NA,district. Nor did it insist upon some soil,91
NA,"drainage on this low-lying site. Again,",91
NA,division has yet to prove that it insisted,91
NA,upon giving 24 hours' notice in writing,91
NA,intention to inspect the excavations,91
NA,the sole plate was put in. The evidence,91
NA,as to whether the excavations were,91
NA,examined or not is in this Parliament.,91
NA,"Why, the stump will not even stand on",91
NA,"own feet! It is supposed to have a flat,",91
NA,straight base. The reason why it has not,91
NA,"a flat, straight base is that the excavations",91
NA,were never cleaned out properly.,91
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! The honor-,91
NA,able member's time has expired.,91
Mr BARNARD ,Bass) [9.59] -Th e bill,91
NA,seeks to make two amendments to the War,91
NA,Service Homes Act. Although they are not,91
NA,"opposed by the Opposition, they are not",91
NA,unimportant. The first relates to surplus,91
NA,moneys paid by way of instalments by,91
NA,ex-servicemen who have purchased homes,91
NA,under the War Service Homes Act. Ever,91
NA,"since the inception of the act, it has been",91
NA,possible for ex-servicemen to pay in,91
NA,amounts additional to the normal monthly,91
NA,"instalments if they wished to do so, and",91
NA,that practice has been accepted by all,91
NA,a governments in the past. It appears now,91
NA,the Attorney-General's Department has,91
NA,"a decided that this practice is not legal, and",91
NA,the bill before us proposes to legalize it.,91
NA,The Opposition believes that a successful,91
NA,"applicant should, if he desires, be able to",91
NA,pay more than the normal instalments for,91
NA,He the purpose of meeting rates and taxes or,91
NA,manfor the purpose of providing additions to,91
NA,largely his home later. The Opposition sub-,91
NA,to this principle and therefore offers,91
NA,which no objection to the proposal.,91
NA,The Opposition does not offer any,91
NA,objection to the second proposed amend-,91
NA,We believe that only persons eligible,91
NA,under the War Service Homes Act should,91
NA,receive the benefits of the act. I under-,91
NA,stand from the second-reading speech of the,91
NA,Minister for Social Services ( Mr Roberton),91
NA,that in some States a practice has,91
NA,And been adopted by which homes have been,91
NA,"made available, by agreement or otherwise,",91
NA,to people other than those who are eligible,91
NA,under the act. The Opposition agrees that,91
NA,that practice should cease. The Minister,91
NA,"has taken appropriate action, in which the",91
NA,the soil in the Opposition concurs.,91
NA,I agree with the honorable member for,91
NA,the Lang ( Mr Stewart) that it is extremely,91
NA,unfortunate that very little opportunity is,91
NA,of given to members for a full debate on the,91
NA,before act. The honorable member for Lang,91
NA,endeavoured to direct attention to some,91
NA,anomalies which the Opposition believes,91
NA,should be adjusted. I suggest that those,91
NA,its anomalies arise not from the act proper,91
NA,but from Government policy. I agree with,91
NA,the statements of the honorable member,92
NA,NA,92
NA,National Development (Senator Spooner),92
NA,"who is in another place, is com-",92
NA,pletely unsympathetic. Although nothing,92
NA,has been said on this side of the House from,92
NA,which one could infer that the department,92
NA,"was unsympathetic, honorable members on",92
NA,both sides can show that the Minister has,92
NA,been completely unsympathetic in his,92
NA,approach to matters in which the circum-,92
NA,stances vary slightly from those prescribed,92
NA,under tho act. I have submitted such cases,92
NA,"to the deputy director in Tasmania, and I",92
NA,know that similar cases have been sub-,92
NA,"mitted by other members. In turn, these",92
NA,cases have been submitted to the Minister,92
NA,for final decision and they have always,92
NA,been received unsympathetically if there,92
NA,was not complete conformity with the,92
NA,requirements of the act. The Opposition,92
NA,believes that the Minister and the Director,92
NA,of War Service Homes should have some,92
NA,power to give favorable decisions on,92
NA,matters that possibly do not come com-,92
NA,pletely within the scope of the act.,92
NA,I believe that the case submitted by the,92
NA,honorable member for Lalor substan-,92
NA,tiates my statement that the Minister has,92
NA,proved to be completely unsympathetic.,92
NA,The honorable member has shown quite,92
NA,conclusively that the home concerned was,92
NA,subject to certain movements to which,92
NA,other homes in the immediate vicinity,92
NA,were not subject. The department has a,92
NA,responsibility in this respect. Although,92
NA,"the honorable member has continually,",92
NA,since representations were first made to,92
NA,"him, referred this matter to the Minister",92
NA,"and to the department, it has been un-",92
NA,"sympathetically received. I believe, as the",92
NA,"honorable member for Lalor believes,",92
NA,"that the owner in question, who has",92
NA,"obtained a loan from the division, is",92
NA,entitled to some consideration as the situa-,92
NA,"tion is due, in part, to the action of the",92
NA,division.,92
NA,I mention this merely to establish that,92
NA,such matters are not being received sym-,92
NA,pathetically. I could refer to other instances,92
NA,but time will not permit me to do so at,92
NA,this stage. The act is one of the most,92
NA,important to come under consideration,92
NA,"from time to time by the Parliament, but",92
NA,it is notable that the Parliament has not,92
NA,had the opportunity to discuss a war service,92
NA,homes measure for more than three years.,92
NA,Returned servicemen's organizations and,92
NA,other interes'.ed parties have repeatedly,92
NA,proposed that the maximum advance under,92
NA,the legislation be increased. I understand,92
NA,that the federal conference of the Returned,92
NA,"Servicemen's League, to be held at the",92
NA,"beginning of next week, will again have on",92
NA,the agenda an i;em requesting the Govern-,92
NA,ment to give immediate consideration to,92
NA,increasing the maximum amount of,92
NA,advance.,92
NA,Mr Falkinder - I think the honorable,92
NA,member is wrong.,92
Mr BARNARD ,Th e honorable mem-,92
NA,ber may dispute the point after I have,92
NA,completed my address. The act has been,92
NA,"in force for 43 years, since 1918. It has",92
NA,been amended from time to time by various,92
NA,Governments but it has not been amended,92
NA,by this Government for more than three,92
NA,"years. If I remember correctly, the maxi-",92
NA,mum amount of advance was last increased,92
NA,in 1955. It is true that total allocations,92
NA,"have increased from £30,000,000 to",92
NA,"£35,000,000, but not during the life of",92
NA,this Parliament. We believe that there is a,92
NA,need for immediate consideration of these,92
NA,"matters. Obviously, the maximum advance",92
NA,is far too low.,92
NA,1 suggest that the amount being pro-,92
NA,vided by the Government this year for the,92
NA,purpose of war service homes cons.ruction,92
NA,is insufficient to meet applications sub-,92
NA,"mitted each year. Unquestionably, there",92
NA,"exist in the minds of ex-servicemen, and",92
NA,particularly amongst returned servicemen's,92
NA,"organizations, some misgivings on this",92
NA,Government's war service homes policy.,92
NA,A war service home may purchased in,92
NA,"three different ways. For example, it may",92
NA,be a group home. Although no group,92
NA,home has been built in the Launceston,92
NA,area in Tasmania for more than three,92
NA,"years, there is a group homes scheme by",92
NA,which an ex-serviceman has an opportunity,92
NA,"of purchasing a home. Secondly, he may",92
NA,"purchase a home that is already erected,",92
NA,whether it be a new home or one that has,92
NA,"stood for a number of years, provided",92
NA,that it meets the requirements of the,92
NA,division. The third point is the right of an,92
NA,ex-serviceman to build according to his own,92
NA,wishes and requirements-subjec t of course,92
NA,to the requirements of the War Service,93
NA,Homes Division in regard to plans and,93
NA,specifications-o n land which he has pur-,93
NA,chased as a deposit. So there are three,93
NA,methods of purchasing a home through the,93
NA,"War Services Homes Division, but the fact",93
NA,remains that because of the policy of this,93
NA,"Government, not dictated by the terms of",93
NA,"the act, but expressed through the respon-",93
NA,"sible Minister in another place, applicants",93
NA,are being denied the opportunity to secure,93
NA,the types of homes to which 1 have just,93
NA,referred.,93
NA,The Opposition believes that opportunity,93
NA,should have been accorded to us on this,93
NA,occasion to engage in full-scale debate on,93
NA,these matters. We are not alone in sug-,93
NA,gesting that there are anomalies in the War,93
NA,Service Homes Act which should not be,93
NA,allowed to continue. The Government has,93
NA,given no consideration to these matters at,93
NA,all. It has ignored the appeals made to it,93
NA,by interested ex-servicemen's organizations,93
NA,that the matters to which I have just re-,93
NA,"ferred-th e maximum advance, for example",93
NA,-shoul d be given immediate consideration.,93
NA,"I hope, during the committee stage, to move",93
NA,an amendment to that effect and I will also,93
NA,take the opportunity to show that the maxi-,93
NA,mum advance now available is certainly,93
NA,not sufficient to meet the average cost of a,93
NA,home to-day.,93
NA,I have no desire to prolong this debate,93
NA,unnecessarily. I have already foreshadowed,93
NA,an amendment which I will move at the,93
NA,"committee stage, and the Opposition will",93
NA,have the opportunity to debate that matter,93
NA,then. I will conclude as I commenced in,93
NA,"this debate, by pointing out that there are",93
NA,matters concerning this act which are not,93
NA,being dealt with sympathetically by the,93
NA,"Government, and certainly not in the",93
NA,generous way that the act originally in-,93
NA,tended. I have already referred to some of,93
NA,those matters and shall not recapitulate them,93
NA,at this stage. But I hope the Government will,93
NA,give earnest attention to the representations,93
NA,that have been made to it by ex-service-,93
NA,men's organizations concerning the maxi-,93
NA,"mum advance, and that it will give con-",93
NA,sideration also to the amendment which I,93
NA,shall move in the committee stage.,93
NA,We believe that not only this Govern-,93
NA,ment but also previous governments have,93
NA,promised the ex-servicemen that no lack of,93
NA,finance would prevent them from receiving,93
NA,their entitlement under the War Service,93
NA,Homes Act. But the fact remains that to-,93
NA,"day there are more than 20,000 applicants",93
NA,awaiting assistance through the War Service,93
NA,"Homes Division, and that is due entirely to",93
NA,the fact that insufficient funds are now being,93
NA,made available yearly by the Government.,93
NA,These matters should be given consideration.,93
NA,Every ex-serviceman is entitled to receive,93
NA,a home through the War Service Homes,93
NA,"Division, in any of the three ways I have",93
NA,"mentioned, without the waiting period that",93
NA,has become customary under this Govern-,93
NA,ment. I believe these matters are worthy,93
NA,"of consideration and I believe that, in view",93
NA,of the representations which have been,93
NA,made to honorable members on the Govern-,93
NA,"ment side of the House, they will take the",93
NA,opportunity to support the amendment,93
NA,which will shortly be moved by the Oppo-,93
NA,sition with a view to increasing the maxi-,93
NA,mum advance to the figure which we think,93
NA,should apply to-day.,93
Mr ROBERTON ,Riverina-Ministe r for,93
NA,Social Services) [10.13] -i n reply- 1 would,93
NA,like to offer my congratulations to the honor-,93
NA,able member for Bass ( Mr Barnard) on,93
NA,the reasonable and reasoned contribution,93
NA,he has made to the debate. In his tem-,93
NA,porary absence from the chamber there,93
NA,was a point when this debate might have,93
NA,"gone astray. Because of that, may I be",93
NA,permitted to remind the House that I intro-,93
NA,"duced this bill some nine weeks ago, on",93
NA,"29th August, and took it to the second-",93
NA,reading stage. The adjournment of the,93
NA,debate was secured by the honorable mem-,93
NA,"ber for Bass, and during the nine inter-",93
NA,vening weeks it would have been com-,93
NA,petent for any honorable member on either,93
NA,side of the House to approach the Govern-,93
NA,ment and suggest that the introduction of,93
NA,the bill might provide an opportunity for,93
NA,a full-dress debate on the general question,93
NA,of war service homes. But no such ap-,93
NA,proach was made. This piece of legisla-,93
NA,tion remained on the business-paper for,93
NA,nine weeks until to-night. Since I had,93
NA,gone to some pains to explain that the pur-,93
NA,pose of the bill was confined to two simple,93
NA,points designed to improve the legislation,93
NA,in the interests of those who qualify for,93
NA,"war service homes, I drew the inference",93
NA,that the Opposition was perfectly satisfied,93
NA,with that explanation and would be willing,94
NA,to confine the debate to those two points.,94
NA,In the course of my second-reading,94
NA,speech-i f I may be permitted to repeat,94
NA,two or three lines in order to pick up the,94
NA,threads of the original discussion- I said,94
NA,that the bill was confined to two matters.,94
NA,I added-,94
NA,The first of these two matters concerns the,94
NA,principle that an ex-serviceman who makes pay-,94
NA,ments to the War Service Homes Division in,94
NA,excess of his instalment^ during the term of his,94
NA,"loan, may withdraw these excess amounts to meet",94
NA,"the normal costs of ownership, to carry out re-",94
NA,"pairs, make additions or alterations and conserve",94
NA,and increase his equity in his own property.,94
NA,"I pointed out that that system had, in",94
NA,"fact, been in practical operation since 1933,",94
NA,but that recently it had been determined,94
NA,by the Attorney-General's Department that,94
NA,it would be more appropriate to write this,94
NA,"provision into the act, and to that end this",94
NA,legislation was brought down.,94
NA,The second matter concerned the prin-,94
NA,"ciple, embodied in the act, which is intended",94
NA,to prevent the transfer of a war service,94
NA,home while the property is still subject to,94
NA,"a security under the act, except with the",94
NA,consent of the director. The War Service,94
NA,Homes Act has contained provision to this,94
NA,effect ever since the legislation which,94
NA,originated the scheme was introduced in,94
NA,1918. Both of these amendments have,94
NA,"been accepted by the Opposition, so there",94
NA,is no cause for disputation and no room,94
NA,for conflict about the purposes of the bill.,94
NA,No one could help being impressed by,94
NA,the sincerity with which the honorable,94
NA,NA,94
NA,the representations he had made on behalf,94
NA,of the unfortunate Mr Lockwood. I have,94
NA,had some discussions with the honorable,94
NA,member for Lalor and I know he has had,94
NA,some discussions with the Minister who is,94
NA,in charge of the War Service Homes Divi-,94
NA,sion. Perhaps I might be permitted to,94
NA,remind honorable members that I am not,94
NA,"the Minister, that the Minister is in another",94
NA,"place, and that in this House I proudly",94
NA,represent the Minister in charge of the War,94
NA,Service Homes Division. No one is in a,94
NA,better position than I to know from day,94
NA,to day how adequately the War Service,94
NA,Homes Division is being administered by,94
NA,both the Minister and the officers of the,94
NA,department.,94
NA,"As I have said, I was impressed by what",94
NA,the honorable member for Lalor had to,94
NA,"say. Unfortunately and unhappily, there",94
NA,"is always another side to a story, and",94
NA,since the Minister and the division have,94
NA,"come under criticism, the other side ought",94
NA,"to be made known, because the matter has",94
NA,not been concluded. I remind the House,94
NA,that it started when representations were,94
NA,made by the honorable member for Lalor,94
NA,on behalf of Mr Lockwood at the begin-,94
NA,ning of the year. After superficial inspec-,94
NA,"tions and much correspondence, it was",94
NA,suggested to the honorable member for,94
NA,Lalor that the matter be referred to an,94
NA,independent arbitrator appointed by a,94
NA,panel of architects nominated by the,94
NA,Victorian Institute of Architects to deter-,94
NA,mine whether the defects could be,94
NA,attributed to negligence on the part of the,94
NA,division in the preparation of the plans and,94
NA,specifications or because of faulty con-,94
NA,struction which should have been detected,94
NA,in the course of supervision. The division,94
NA,offered to pay the arbitrator's fees if Mr.,94
NA,Lockwood agreed to this course being fol-,94
NA,lowed. Unfortunately the honorable,94
NA,member for Lalor did not favor this,94
NA,proposal.,94
NA,"On 4th April, 1961, the Minister in",94
NA,charge of the War Service Homes,94
NA,"Division, who is in another place, wrote",94
NA,to the honorable member for Lalor and,94
NA,gave him a summary of the technical as-,94
NA,pects based on the advice furnished by,94
NA,the Chief Architect. The Minister sug-,94
NA,gested that the most appropriate course,94
NA,would be to refer the matter to an,94
NA,"independent arbitrator, in all the circum-",94
NA,stances. The honorable member for Lalor,94
NA,replied to the Minister's letter on 10th,94
NA,"April 1961, listing a series of technical",94
NA,points concerning the construction of the,94
NA,"stumps, &c. He claimed that the defects",94
NA,were due to faulty construction of the,94
NA,"foundations, or to the fact that the division",94
NA,had failed to design foundations adequate,94
NA,to cope with the soil peculiarities of the,94
NA,districts. The honorable member for Lalor,94
NA,rejected the suggestion that the matter,94
NA,should be referred to an independent,94
NA,arbitrator. The various technical argu-,94
NA,ments raised by the honorable member,94
NA,for Lalor were examined in a report sub-,94
NA,"mitted by the Chief Architect, who stated",94
NA,lhat he could not accept the honorable,95
NA,member's conclusions.,95
NA,As a deadlock had been reached on the,95
NA,"technical matters in dispute, and as",95
NA,"honorable member had rejected the prowhich,",95
NA,posal to refer the matter to an independent,95
NA,"arbitrator, the Department of Works was",95
NA,requested to carry out an independent,95
NA,investigation and to furnish a report,95
NA,the reasons for the subsistence of Mr.,95
NA,Lockwood's home. Comprehensive investiof,95
NA,"gations were carried out on the site, and",95
NA,a most comprehensive report by a soils,95
NA,"engineer was received on 4th. July, 1961.",95
NA,"The report, reduced as far as possible",95
NA,"non-technical terms, stated that on the",95
NA,evidence obtained in the course of investi-,95
NA,gations it was considered that the differentheThere,95
NA,tial movement of the foundations had been,95
NA,caused almost solely by the highly to,95
NA,expansive nature of the soil in association,95
NA,with the particular localized and variable,95
NA,moisture conditions occurring on the site.,95
NA,The report also stated that an assessment,95
NA,of the bearing capacity of the foundations,95
NA,provided had established that all footings,95
NA,were within the safe limits in regard,95
NA,their bearing value imposed on the soil.,95
NA,In substance the report fully supported the,95
NA,views of the division's own Chief Architect.,95
NA,As the report of the soils engineer,95
NA,clearly showed that the subsistence of Mr.,95
NA,Lockwood's home was not due to faulty,95
NA,"construction of the foundations, but rather",95
NA,to the peculiarities of the soil in association,95
NA,with the particular localized moisture,95
NA,"ditions occurring on the site, the Minister",95
NA,"advised the honorable member for Lalor,",95
NA,"in a letter dated 26th July, that responsi-",95
NA,bility could not be accepted on the ground,95
NA,that the foundations were not properly conin this fashion.,95
NA,structed. In regard to the honorable mem-,95
NA,ber's other contention that the division,95
NA,should accept the responsibility on the,95
NA,ground that it had failed to design foundafor,95
NA,tions adequate to cope with the soil pecudebate.,95
NA,"liarities of the locality, the Minister",95
NA,out in his letter of 26th July that the,95
NA,normal inspection of Mr Lockwood's home,95
NA,had been carried out by a technical,95
NA,before the specifications for the home had,95
NA,"been prepared, and that two test holes were",95
NA,sunk. These tests did not disclose,95
NA,"dency of the soil to erupt, and there was",95
NA,nothing to suggest that the normal kind of,95
NA,foundations specified by the division would,95
NA,not be satisfactory. It was also pointed out,95
NA,that the footings specified by the division,95
NA,actually exceeded the requirements of the,95
NA,the Victorian uniform building regulations,95
NA,according to written advice received,95
NA,"by a qualified officer of the local council,",95
NA,appeared to be quite satisfactory in the area,95
NA,in which the home was constructed. The,95
NA,on reasons why responsibility could not be,95
NA,accepted were fully set out in the letter,95
NA,26th July to the honorable member for,95
NA,Lalor. The letter also repeated offers made,95
NA,on previous occasions to assist Mr.,95
NA,Lockwood to carry out repairs by granting,95
NA,"to him an additional loan, or to grant him a",95
NA,second loan in respect of another home.,95
NA,"the matter stands, and it is for",95
NA,"honorable member for Lalor, making",95
NA,"representations on behalf of Mr Lockwood,",95
NA,convince the Minister and the officers of,95
NA,the War Service Homes Division. If he,95
NA,"fails to do so, then there is nothing I can",95
NA,"do in the matter, nor is there anything any",95
NA,other honorable member can do. So I,95
NA,suggest that the honorable member for,95
NA,Lalor apply himself to the task. Whether,95
NA,to he can win the approval of the Minister,95
NA,and the officers of the division of an alter-,95
NA,"native proposal, I cannot say, but it is his",95
NA,manifest duty to try to do so. It is wrong,95
NA,for him to suppose that the matter has not,95
NA,been considered. There I let the matter rest.,95
NA,Mr Cairns - Mr Deputy Speaker,95

NA,"Order! The Minister, in making his reply,",95
NA,"conhas closed the debate. The question is,",95
NA,""" That the bill be now read a second time "".",95
NA,"Mr Cairns -Well , I do not think it is",95
NA,proper for the Minister to close the debate,95
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Order ! I,95

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Order ! The,96

NA,Mr Cairns -Ver y well.,96
NA,In committee:,96
NA,Clauses 1 to 6-b y leave-take n together.,96
NA,NA,96
NA,want to say to the Minister for Social,96
NA,Services ( Mr Roberton) that the lies,96
NA,have been told in this instance,96
NA,At no time was the offer of an independent,96
NA,arbitrator refused. Nor did the Minister,96
NA,allege in any correspondence that it,96
NA,refused. It was not viewed with favour;,96
NA,that is true. An offer to pay the arbitrator's,96
NA,fee was made. In the presence of the independent,96
NA,"Minister, the Director of War Service",96
NA,Homes was asked what that would cost,96
NA,and he replied that it would cost 30 to,96
NA,"guineas. The Minister, to his credit, said,",96
NA,""" I would sooner give it to the ex-servicein",96
NA,"man "". But how does the unfortunate for",96
NA,ex-serviceman get on? He would require,96
NA,an advocate to deal with the matter. The,96
NA,War Service Homes Division has its legal,96
NA,advisers at its disposal. Why does not the,96
NA,Minister offer to pay the ex-serviceman's,96
NA,"costs? If he did that, he might be",96
NA,to talk turkey.,96
NA,Mr Roberton -Th e division offered,96
NA,pay the arbitrator.,96
NA,NA,96
NA,serviceman conduct his case without,96
NA,advocate? This is a highly technical,96
NA,matter. If he lost he would be up for 100,96
NA,guineas or more. What does it cost to get,96
NA,a barrister or advocate? The Minister does,96
NA,not understand the elementary principles,96
NA,of British justice.,96
Mr CAIRNS ,Yarra) [10.32] - Mr .,96
NA,"Chairman, I do not think that, in the cir-",96
NA,"cumstances, we can agree to these clauses.",96
NA,The Minister for Social Services ( Mr.,96
NA,Roberton) has read in some detail this,96
NA,evening an answer to the case made by the,96
NA,NA,96
The CHAIRMAN , Mr Lucock) -I s the,96
NA,honorable member referring to a speech,96
NA,made by the Minister at the second-reading,96
NA,stage?,96
Mr CAIRNS , I am speaking to clauses,96
NA,1 to 6 of the bill. May I say that this,96
NA,matter is completely relevant to these,96
NA,"clauses, and the Minister has treated it as",96
NA,being relevant in relation to what the hon-,96
NA,orable member for Lalor has said. I think,96
NA,that I am quite entitled to answer the,96
NA,Minister.,96
NA,Mr Howson -Whic h clause is the hon-,96
NA,orable member dealing with?,96
Mr CAIRNS ,Th e honorable membet,96
NA,that may be happy to know that I am dealing,96
NA,are typical. with clauses 1 to 6.,96
NA,This matter has reached a stage at which,96
NA,a certain point requires to be resolved. The,96
NA,was person who owns the house and who is,96
NA,in this difficulty would be faced with legal,96
NA,expenses if he were represented before an,96
NA,arbitrator although the arbitra-,96
NA,tor's fees would have been paid without,96
NA,expense to the ex-serviceman. He could,96
NA,40 not easily oppose the War Service Homes,96
NA,Division. The implication of the Minister,96
NA,answer to what the honorable member,96
NA,"Lalor has just said in committee, obvi-",96
NA,"ously, is not correct. The position is not",96
NA,as the Minister put it. He said that Mr.,96
NA,Lockwood would not agree to the matter,96
NA,being resolved on the basis which has been,96
NA,"mentioned, but that is not so. Mr Lock-",96
NA,able wood was not asked to agree to that.,96
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The hon-,96
NA,to orable member is not in order in dealing,96
NA,with this subject-matter in relation to,96
NA,clauses 1 to 6. It was discussed at the,96
NA,stage and has no relation to,96
NA,an the clauses now before the committee.,96
NA,NA,96
NA,"Chairman, the Minister's offer to give the",96
NA,ex-serviceman the opportunity to obtain,96
NA,"another loan, if one looks at it sensibly, is",97
NA,seen to be an extremely mean proposition.,97
NA,The ex-serviceman is faced with the diffi-,97
NA,culty of selling a defective dwelling on the,97
NA,"open market, and he could easily lose",97
NA,"f 1,000. Jf the War Service Homes Division",97
NA,would offer to let him sell his property on,97
NA,"the open market, and to make up the differ-",97
NA,"ence if he incurred any loss, and then to",97
NA,finance the construction of a similar dwell-,97
NA,ing with sewerage and other facilities com-,97
NA,"parable with those in the exsting dwelling,",97
NA,that would be a decent offer. Is it just to,97
NA,suggest that the ex-serviceman ought to sell,97
NA,the house and face a loss of considerable,97
NA,proportions? Is that justice? Would the,97
NA,Director of War Service Homes or the,97
NA,Minister like to be placed in such a position?,97
NA,Let me now deal with the offer of a,97
NA,loan to repair the damage to the dwelling.,97
NA,1 have not stated what the division's estimate,97
NA,"was, because the owner is endeavouring to",97
NA,get a contractor to repair the damaged,97
NA,foundations. The estimated cost runs into,97
NA,three figures. Lord only knows what will be,97
NA,the cost of stripping off the weatherboards,97
NA,and the plaster and putting everything back,97
NA,in position. Is there any justice in the pro-,97
NA,posal made by the division? It states that,97
NA,"having regard to the nature of the sub-soil,",97
NA,"the house was durable, sound, and so on.",97
NA,What happened? The only allegation,97
NA,against the owner is that he put several,97
NA,inches of soil around the base of the house.,97
NA,Everybody does that in order to grow a few,97
NA,pansies or something of the sort. The divi-,97
NA,"sion's attitude is ridiculous, contemptible",97
NA,"and paltry in the extreme, in the absence",97
NA,of any other allegation against the owner,97
NA,and of any cause other than the peculiarity,97
NA,of the soil which might have resulted in,97
NA,the damage that occurred. What did cause,97
NA,the house to become as it is now? There is,97
NA,not one allegation against the owner. The,97
NA,War Service Homes Division built the dwell-,97
NA,ing according to its own specifications.,97
NA,Why doss it not do the decent thing now?,97
NA,Clauses agreed to.,97
NA,Proposed new clause.,97
Mr BARNARD ,Bass) [10.37] - I,97
NA,move-,97
NA,That the following new clause be inserted in,97
NA,the bill:-,97
NA,""" 2A. Section twenty-one of the Principal Act",97
NA,is amended by omitting from sub-section (I.) the,97
NA,words ' Two thousand seven hundred and fifty,97
NA,pounds' and inserting in their stead the words,97
NA,' Three thousand five hundred pounds,97
NA,The effect of this amendment will be to,97
NA,increase the maximum advance from,97
NA,"£2,750 to £3,500. The Opposition con-",97
NA,"tends that £2,750 is not enough to meet",97
NA,"the average cost of a home and, indeed,",97
NA,falls far short of it. The Government's,97
NA,attention has been directed to this fact by,97
NA,the Director of War Service Homes himself,97
NA,"in his annual report for the year 1959-60,",97
NA,in which he stated-,97
NA,The figures show that the trend away from,97
NA,assistance to build a home towards assistance to,97
NA,purchase an already erected home referred to in,97
NA,earlier reports has continued. Many factors have,97
NA,"contributed to this, but undoubtedly increasing",97
NA,building costs and the phenomenal rises in the,97
NA,prices being paid for building blocks are signifi-,97
NA,cant factors.,97
NA,The only interpretation that the Opposition,97
NA,"or, indeed, any Government supporter, in-",97
NA,"cluding the Minister, can put on that state-",97
NA,ment by the director is that the maximum,97
NA,advance is not sufficient to enable ex-,97
NA,servicemen who are eligible under the terms,97
NA,of the War Service Homes Act to obtain,97
NA,from the division sufficientfinanceto build,97
NA,a home.,97
NA,The maximum advance has remained at,97
NA,"£2,750 since 1951. In that year the maxi-",97
NA,mum advance for the construction of a,97
NA,"new home was increased from £2,000 to",97
NA,"£2,750. In 1954, the maximum advance",97
NA,"was increased to £2,750 for existing dwel-",97
NA,lings as well. As I pointed out at the,97
NA,"second-reading stage, £2,750, obviously, is",97
NA,far below the amount that any ex-service-,97
NA,"man requires for a home to-day, having",97
NA,regard to the tremendous increase in the,97
NA,average cost of houses. Anybody who,97
NA,wanls substantiation of that fact will find,97
NA,it at page twenty of the last available,97
NA,annual report of the Director of War,97
NA,Service Homes-tha t for 1959-60-whic h,97
NA,shows fhat the average co.>t of a home has,97
NA,substantially increased in recent years in,97
NA,all States. I shall refer to only one or two,97
NA,"of the States, but the position is the same",97
NA,"in ail of them. According to this report,",97
NA,the average cost of a home in New South,97
NA,"Wales in 1954-55 was £3,386, and in",97
NA,1959-60 the average cost of dwelling house,97
NA,and land was £3.949-a n increase of,97
NA,almost £600 in five years. But the maxi-,97
NA,"mum advance, which was £2.750 in",97
NA,"1954-55, was still £2,750 in 1959-60 and",98
NA,"is still £2,750 in 1961. In South Australia",98
NA,the average cost of a home in 1954-55 was,98
NA,"£3,276 and to-day it is £4,190-a n",98
NA,"increase of about £900. In Tasmania, the",98
NA,"increase was from £3,159 in 1954-55 to",98
NA,"£3,595 in 1959-60-a n increase of about",98
NA,£400.,98
NA,The figures for the Australian Capital,98
NA,Territory show how hopeless it is for an,98
NA,ex-serviceman to try to secure a property,98
NA,in this Territory under the War Service,98
NA,Homes Act unless he can pay a very sub-,98
NA,stantial deposit. The average cost of a,98
NA,home in the Australian Capital Territory,98
NA,"has increased from £4,153 to £5,638 be-",98
NA,tween 1954-55 and 1959-60. This is for,98
NA,"the dwelling only, and not for the dwelling",98
NA,and the land. This is an increase in those,98
NA,"five years of £1,500. Yet the maximum",98
NA,advance under the act has remained,98
NA,stationary since 1951.,98
NA,This is a matter that has been raised,98
NA,the Parliament again and again. I have,98
NA,not moved the amendment merely as a,98
NA,way of stating the Opposition's opinion on,98
NA,"the matter. My amendment, as I have",98
NA,"said, has the full support of all the returned",98
NA,servicemen's organizations in Australia.,98
NA,Year after year at the annual conferences,98
NA,of the Returned Servicemen's League and,98
NA,other ex-servicemen's organizations there,98
NA,are agenda items urging that the maximum,98
NA,advance be substantially increased. The,98
NA,motions passed at these conferences,98
NA,communicated to the Government in the,98
NA,form of submissions to the responsible,98
NA,"Minister, but they have been rejected convery",98
NA,sistently. The Government is completely,98
NA,unsympathetic to the need to increase the,98
NA,maximum advance in accordance with,98
NA,increase that has occurred in the average,98
NA,cost of homes.,98
NA,In those circumstances it is not astonish-,98
NA,ing to find that the number of people,98
NA,awaiting assistance from the War Service,98
NA,Homes Division remains static from year,98
NA,"to year at about 20,000. Applicants are",98
NA,not being assisted at the rate that the,98
NA,Opposition thinks they should be. This,98
NA,not entirely due to the increase in the,98
NA,amount of deposit that an ex-serviceman,98
NA,would need for a home; it is also due,98
NA,the fact that the Government has imposed,98
NA,other restrictions. It has imposed a wait-,98
NA,ing period. I submit that the reason for,98
NA,the waiting period imposed by the Govern-,98
NA,ment is that an insufficient total sum is,98
NA,being made available each year for loans,98
NA,by the War Service Homes Division. The,98
NA,"amount is now £35,000,000, according to",98
NA,"the last Budget, and it has been stationary",98
NA,at that figure for several years. It in-,98
NA,creased to its present figure from,98
NA,"£16,000,000 in 1949. The amount made",98
NA,"available has slightly more than doubled,",98
NA,but the average cost of a home has far,98
NA,more than doubled since 1949. The,98
NA,Opposition contends that the appropria-,98
NA,"tion for this purpose should be increased,",98
NA,and I know there are honorable members,98
NA,on the Government side who agree with,98
NA,that view. They must know that the,98
NA,"appropriation is far too low, which is pre-",98
NA,venting many ex-servicemen from obtain-,98
NA,ing war service homes. I do not want to,98
NA,reiterate the point already made by the,98
NA,"in director, who has brought to the attention",98
NA,of the Government the fact that in his,98
NA,opinion- I can place no other interpreta-,98
NA,tion on the statement I have quoted earlier,98
NA,-th e money advanced is insufficient.,98
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The hon-,98
NA,orable member's time has expired.,98
Mr HOWSON ,Fawkner) [10.47] - I,98
NA,should like to direct the attention of the,98
NA,"honorable member for Bass ( Mr Barnard),",98
NA,who said that many people would like to,98
NA,are see the maximum advance raised from,98
NA,"£2,750 to £3,500, to the fact that there",98
NA,are just as many people who would be,98
NA,"happy to accept a loan of £2,750. Is",98
NA,it not right that people who have saved,98
NA,money towards a deposit on a house should,98
NA,"the be lent £2,750? The honorable member",98
NA,for Bass is interjecting now. There were,98
NA,no interjections from me while he was,98
NA,speaking.,98
NA,Mr Barnard -Yo u were interjecting on,98
NA,me.,98
Mr HOWSON , I did not interject on,98
NA,"the honorable member for Bass, Mr Chair-",98
NA,man. I think he is quite in error in saying,98
NA,is so. He is wrong in thinking that I would,98
NA,be game enough to interject on him to-,98
NA,night. I may have done so on other,98
NA,"to occasions, but when he was speaking with",98
NA,such vehemence and such effect I would,98
NA,not have dared to interject. Surely nobody,99
NA,would think that I would try to interject,99
NA,on such an erudite person.,99
NA,There are a large number of people in,99
NA,"my electorate, whom 1 know, who would",99
NA,"be very glad of a loan of £2,750. These",99
NA,are people who have already gone out of,99
NA,their way to save money for a home. Is,99
NA,it no; right that we should help them,99
NA,before we should think of helping the,99
NA,people for whom a loan of £2.750 would,99
NA,not be sufficient and who would require a,99
NA,"loan of £3,500? Surely it is better that we",99
NA,should help people who have saved to give,99
NA,themselves a stake in the country.,99
NA,"Mr Whitlam -I n other words, you want",99
NA,to help those who need the least help.,99
Mr HOWSON , I think it is better to,99
NA,help people who have shown that they are,99
NA,prepared to help themselves instead of,99
NA,expecting the slate to do everything for,99
NA,them. Surely we can help more people if,99
NA,"the loan is £2,750 than we will be able to",99
NA,"help if the loan is £3,500. Surely it is",99
NA,better for the Government to help as many,99
NA,people as possible. I am sure that honor-,99
NA,able members opposite know that there is no,99
NA,waiting period for people who want to,99
NA,build a new home now. Anybody who has,99
NA,gone out of his way to save for a home will,99
NA,get a home. Is it not better to help those,99
NA,people first? Is that not better than having,99
NA,a smaller number of applicants building on,99
NA,"a loan of £3,500? The Opposition should",99
NA,look at this matter a little more closely and,99
NA,"study the facts as they are now, rather than",99
NA,offer this wonderful theory we get peren-,99
NA,nially from the honorable member for,99
NA,Bass and the honorable member for Short-,99
NA,land ( Mr Griffiths).,99
NA,Mr Barnard -An d you just as con-,99
NA,sistently oppose them.,99
Mr HOWSON ," I do, because I believe",99
NA,in helping those who are prepared to help,99
NA,themselves rather than those who expect,99
NA,the state to help them time and time again.,99
NA,Mr Barnard -Yo u repeat the Govern-,99
NA,ment line.,99
Mr HOWSON ,I t may be the Govern-,99
NA,"ment line, but I believe it is the line taken",99
NA,by the majority of my constituents and those,99
NA,1 represent in this chamber.,99
NA,Mr Whitlam -Ho w many of them want,99
NA,war service homes?,99
Mr HOWSON , I have as many constitu-,99
NA,ents as any honorable member opposite. 1,99
NA,simply say that 1 think members of the,99
NA,Opposition should look at the practical,99
NA,situa.ion rather than at what they would,99
NA,"like it to be in theory. In my opinion, a",99
NA,vote should be taken against the amendment,99
NA,at once.,99
Mr WHITLAM ,Werriwa) [10.521 - I,99

NA,member for Fawkner ( Mr Howson) is ad-,99

Mr BEATON ,Bendigo) [10.6] - I,100

NA,55 ably put by the honorable member for,100
NA,NA,100
NA,"what may be called exhibit A, the stump,",100
NA,25,100
NA,"may have been a little unorthodox, but it",100
NA,AYES. reflects his sincerity and his belief that a,100
NA,"James, A. W.",100

NA,grave injustice has been done.,100
Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. John MCLeay) -,100
NA,"Makin, N . J. O.",100
NA,"OXonnor, W. P. Order! I direct the honorable member's",100
NA,attention to the fact that the motion before,100
NA,the House is for the third reading of the,100
NA,bill. He should confine his remarks to,100
NA,the bill.,100
Mr BEATON , I want to mention the,100
NA,Duthie. G. W. A.,100
NA,proposal that the Minister put. He sug-,100
NA,gested that an independent architect should,100
NA,NOES. arbitrate on the matter. The honorable,100
NA,Haworth. W. C.,100
NA,"Holt, Harold",100
NA,member for Lalor rightly expressed his,100
NA,"doubt that an architect would, in effect,",100
NA,"pass judgment on another architect, for",100
NA,"Hulme, A. S.",100
NA,"Jess, J. D .",100
NA,tbat is what this would mean. The ex-,100
NA,soldier would be required to pay the fees,100
NA,"of the independent architect, if the decision",100
NA,"Mackinnon, E. D.",100
NA,"MCMahon, W.",100
NA,went against him. He is a labourer and,100
NA,such an expense would be far beyond his,100
NA,means. The Minister spoke of the evidence,100
NA,of soils and in particular referred to the,100
NA,""" highly expansive nature of the soils "". I",100
NA,suggest the compacting of the soil under,100
NA,the stump and not the expansion of the,100
NA,"Wheeler, R. C. soil was the cause of the subsidence.",100
NA,Whittorn. R. H.,100
NA,Wilson. K. C. I have had the assistance of the War,100
NA,Service Homes Division in building my,100
NA,"Turnbull, W. O. home and I am indeed very appreciative",100
NA,"of this help. I paid inspection fees, as the",101
NA,"ex-soldier did, and I ask: Why are they",101
NA,paid? It is my understanding that the War,101
NA,Service Homes Division has to approve the,101
NA,plans and specifications and the site. If the,101
NA,site on this occasion was approved and if,101
NA,the Minister's contention about the soil is,101
NA,"correct, the site was approved in error.",101
NA,No proof was given by the Minister that,101
NA,"the stump holes were inspected, as is",101
NA,required. We know that this is so because,101
NA,of the evidence that was in the House a,101
NA,short time ago. We had the stump here.,101
NA,It was dug out with a mattock and shovel,101

NA,"[11.13] -Thi s bill, amending the act of",101

NA,"1964, including provision that work",101

NA,"increased by £1,300,000 to £2,700,000 this",101
NA,year.,101
NA,While the Opposition supported the 1957,101
NA,and 1958 bills as making some contribution,101
NA,to general knowledge in furthering the,101
NA,"search for oil in Australia, we opposed the",101
NA,1959 bill because-we felt that the provision,101
NA,being made by the Government was utterly,101
NA,inadequate to meet the needs of the,101
NA,situation and because we felt that the,101
NA,Government should use its funds for more,101
NA,basic activity leading to the locating of,101
NA,targets for oil drilling. Our views in this,101
NA,matter have not changed. Indeed the,101
NA,passage of time has emphasised the need,101
NA,to intensify greatly the search for oil in,101
NA,Australia.,101
NA,SENATE. We believe that in preference to sub-,101
NA,sidizing private companies the Government,101
NA,should itself take the lead in conducting,101
NA,this search for oil in this country. It,101
NA,should accelerate that search by developing,101
NA,the activities of the Bureau of Mineral,101
NA,"Resources in mapping, geological and",101
NA,geophysical surveys and in drilling for oil,101
NA,by staffs directly employed by the Govern-,101
NA,"ment. In addition to this, the Government",101
NA,should develop research in the production,101
NA,of oil from coal and shale.,101
NA,On behalf of the Opposition I shall move,101
NA,an amendment to the motion for the second,101
NA,"reading to this effect, and if it is defeated",101
NA,we shall vote against the bill.,101
NA,"In short, the Labour Party holds that",101
NA,we should ensure not only that the search,101
NA,for oil should be conducted with the utmost,101
NA,vigour as a public activity rather than as,101
NA,"a private activity, but also that when oil is",101
NA,found in Australia it should remain the,101
NA,property of the Australian people and not,101
NA,pass into the control of the great private,101
NA,oil interests which have exploited already,101
NA,so much of the oil resources of so many,101
NA,countries for their own immense enrich-,102
NA,ment. We should make sure that that does,102
NA,not happen in this country.,102
NA,Oil is a most suitable commodity to,102
NA,form the basis of a publicly owned enter-,102
NA,"price, from the conduct of the surveys and",102
NA,the drilling for the oil right up to the point,102
NA,of refining and distribution to the retail sales,102
NA,outlets. Every one realizes in a general,102
NA,way the threat to national security in the,102
NA,fact that we are totally dependent on over-,102
NA,seas supplies of oil. It is also generally,102
NA,agreed that the cost of importing oil is a,102
NA,heavy burden on our overseas trade bal-,102
NA,ances. The actual figures sharpen this,102
NA,realization to an extraordinary degree.,102
NA,They show that on both grounds the solving,102
NA,of this problem of finding oil in Australia,102
NA,"is a matter of vital urgency, and that, by",102
NA,comparison the steps which the Govern-,102
NA,ment is taking towards finding oil are farci-,102
NA,"cally short of what is required, and ridicu-",102
NA,lously short of what is being done in other,102
NA,countries-i n countries that already have,102
NA,oil.,102
NA,The demand for petroleum products in,102
NA,"Australia has more than doubled since 1950,",102
NA,"when it was 4,900.000 tons, until to-day it",102
NA,"is just over 10,000,000 tons a year.",102
NA,Mr Halbert -Wh o wrote this speech?,102
Mr ALLAN FRASER , I write all of,102
NA,my speeches before I bring them into this,102
NA,House because I like to present a clear,102
NA,statement of facts to the Parliament. I,102
NA,wrote this speech in the early hours of this,102
NA,morning.,102
NA,At present petroleum products provide,102
NA,"about 39 per cent, of Australia's energy",102
NA,requirements compared with only 28 per,102
NA,"cent, ten years ago. Indeed, petroleum",102
NA,products are supplying practically all of,102
NA,the annual increase in this nation's energy,102
NA,consumption.,102
NA,In money terms the import of petroleum,102
NA,"is now costing Australia about £140,000,000",102
NA,a year. That figure is made up of,102
NA,"£105,000,000, representing the total cost of",102
NA,"petroleum imports, less about £22,000,000",102
NA,representing the value of our exports from,102
NA,"our local refineries, plus the extraordinary",102
NA,"annual cost of £30,000.000 for overseas",102
NA,"freight of our oil imports plus £5,000,000",102
NA,for coastal freight.,102
NA,"These immense freight costs reflect, of",102
NA,"course, the tragic fact that there is not",102
NA,even one oil tanker operating under the,102
NA,Australian flag so that all transport becomes,102
NA,a charge against our overseas funds. But,102
NA,apart from the very heavy inroads which,102
NA,these charges make upon our foreign ex-,102
NA,change is the even more desperate fact that,102
NA,because we are completely dependent on,102
NA,outside sources for oil our defences of this,102
NA,country are exactly as vulnerable as sea,102
NA,traffic is in war time.,102
NA,The gravity of the position is underlined,102
NA,by the rapidly increasing consumption of,102
NA,oil in Australia in the post-war years.,102
NA,Australia's oil consumption is now doub-,102
NA,ling every nine years. The cost of oil,102
NA,"already represents almost 10 per cent, of",102
NA,the cost of all our imports. The figures,102
NA,indicate that this percentage will continue,102
NA,rapidly to increase. We simply cannot,102
NA,afford to go on pouring out money to,102
NA,import oil while it is certain that oil,102
NA,"exists in Australia, and can be found in",102
NA,commercial quantities if we are prepared,102
NA,to apply ourselves seriously to the search,102
NA,"for it. Further, the position is that an",102
NA,enemy who could cut our sea lanes,102
NA,could paralyse Australia industrially with-,102
NA,in a matter of weeks.,102
NA,"In that situation, the Government should",102
NA,be making the search for oil a matter of,102
NA,utmost priority. It should be devoting a very,102
NA,substantial proportion of the defence ex-,102
NA,"penditure to the search. Instead, the",102
NA,Government is fast asleep on the matter,102
NA,of the search for oil in Australia. The,102
NA,scale of its contribution is infinitesimal in,102
NA,relation to the values which are at stake.,102
NA,Judged by the measure of its oil-search,102
NA,"efforts, the Government's attitude ap-",102
NA,parently is that it does not really matter,102
NA,"whether oil is found in Australia, but it",102
NA,must make some sort of a gesture because,102
NA,it has been prodded into doing so. The,102
NA,Government's attitude bears no relation,102
NA,whatever to the reality that lack of local,102
NA,supplies of oil is eating into the heart,102
NA,"of our economy and, in an emergency,",102
NA,could bring Australia swiftly to total dis-,102
NA,aster.,102
NA,Let us look more closely at this position,102
NA,for a moment. It is generally recognized,102
NA,that the desirable minimum oil reserves,102
NA,are the equivalent of twenty years' re-,103
NA,quirements. On the basis of the con-,103
NA,"sumption trends which I have quoted,",103
NA,"Australia needs, at present, reserves of",103
NA,"4,800,000,000 barrels. Making the al-",103
NA,lowances which the experts consider,103
NA,"necessary for porosity and so on, this",103
NA,means that we need to discover oil pools,103
NA,"with a total reservoir volume of 12,000,000",103
NA,acre feet before we can be satisfied that,103
NA,we have sufficient oil even for our im-,103
NA,"mediate needs. By 1970, if the consump-",103
NA,tion of oil in Australia continues to in-,103
NA,"crease at the present rate, the basic reserve",103
NA,"requirement will be 11,000,000,000",103
NA,"barrels or 27,000,000 acre feet of reser-",103
NA,"voir. That, of course, makes no allowance",103
NA,for export or for the greater use of oil,103
NA,which is certain to occur once it is locally,103
NA,produced. Many people were astonished,103
NA,that the tested production rate of about,103
NA,50 barrels a day at Cabawin was not re-,103
NA,"garded as commercial production-tha t is,",103
NA,was not regarded as profitable.,103
NA,I want to deal for a moment with this,103
NA,aspect of the cost that is involved in,103
NA,profitable search for oil and to relate,103
NA,cost to the very small amount the Commonand,103
NA,wealth is contributing from Consolidated,103
NA,Revenue-fro m national funds-toward,103
NA,this very costly business of obtaining oil,103
NA,commercial quantities. The costs that oilprospects,103
NA,men consider in deciding profitability,103
NA,include the cost of drilling the producing,103
NA,"well, the cost of providing collection and",103
NA,"storage facilities, and the cost of transport",103
NA,between the well and the marketing points,103
NA,as well as a proportion of the exploration,103
NA,costs up to the stage of discovery. When,103
NA,"they have added all those up, they double",103
NA,"the total so as to provide, for future",103
NA,"ploration, an amount equal to all the costs",103
NA,that have been involved in bringing that,103
NA,particular oil well into production.,103
NA,Cabawin was adjudged non-commercial,103
NA,or non-profiitable because the cost of drillGuinea,103
NA,ing the well was more than the value,103
NA,"five years' production, and because the",103
NA,value of total oil recoverable by the,103
NA,from the surrounding 40 acres was less,103
NA,than the cost of drilling the well. In those,103
NA,"circumstances, the oil industry does",103
NA,regard bringing the oil out of the ground,103
NA,"as worth-while. Similarly, apparently,",103
NA,"far as I know, Rough Range was adjudged",103
NA,non-commercial because the volume of the,103
NA,pool is so small that not enough wells can,103
NA,be drilled to obtain sufficient production to,103
NA,"cover all the capital costs involved,",103
NA,reckoned on the very high basis that I,103
NA,mentioned a moment or two ago. On the,103
NA,"other hand, the gas wells in Papua could",103
NA,become commercial at any time if the gas,103
NA,could be used for power generation in a,103
NA,large industry such as aluminium produc-,103
NA,"tion, or if market requirements in Australia",103
NA,were large enough to justify its liquefaction,103
NA,and the use of refrigerated tankers to bring,103
NA,it to this country.,103
NA,Oil exploration costs are high in Australia,103
NA,compared with those in the United States,103
NA,"of America and Europe, where equipment",103
NA,and services are readily available. I am,103
NA,informed that the adequate exploration of,103
NA,"a single four-mile sheet area-tha t is, an",103
NA,area roughly 100 miles by 65 miles-i n a,103
NA,sedimentary basin on the Australian main-,103
NA,"land would cost about £3,300,000, or £500",103
NA,a square mile. The detailedfigureson that,103
NA,indicate the tremendous number of surveys,103
NA,"the which, under modern methods, are now",103
NA,that undertaken. They include seismic surveys,103
NA,test drilling in not less than twelve,103
NA,"bores to a depth of 10,000 feet. When",103
NA,"s that exploration has been made, it gives",103
NA,in a clear picture of the geology and the oil,103
NA,of the particular area. In very,103
NA,"fortunate circumstances, it may actually",103
NA,result in the finding of a pool of oil. At,103
NA,"least, the extent of the prospect of an oil",103
NA,"pool occurring will be reasonably clear,",103
NA,although much more test drilling may still,103
NA,"be required to be done there in the area,",103
NA,"in which over £3,000,000 has already been",103
NA,"spent in surveys and exploration, before",103
NA,"exany pools are found, if they are finally",103
NA,"found-and , of course, they may not be.",103
NA,In the more inhospitable areas such as,103
NA,"the Central Canning Basin, the New",103
NA,"rain forests and off-shore areas, the",103
NA,of cost of such exploration may be of the,103
NA,"order, not of £3,000,000, but rather of",103
NA,"well £10,000,000, or even £15,000,000. That",103
NA,is the cost of exploring a single area. I,103
NA,quote those figures because they put into,103
NA,not proper perspective the intention of the,103
NA,"Government to spend altogether, in the",103
NA,"so presentfinancialyear, about £4,000,000 on",103
NA,prosecuting the search for oil in Australia.,103
NA,The point that I am leading to is that,104
NA,"the cost, not necessarily of finding oil,",104
NA,of the essential preliminary exploration of,104
NA,"all the basins on the Australian mainland,",104
NA,"will be of the order of £500,000,000. The",104
NA,cost of similar exploration in New Guinea,104
NA,"would be another £200,000,000 at least.",104
NA,It is in the light of these totals that the,104
NA,Government's current intention to spend,104
NA,"£1,400,000 on oil search and £2,700,000",104
NA,on oil subsidy is to be judged. In the light,104
NA,"of the work to be performed, the Govern-",104
NA,ment's proposals are insignificant; in the,104
NA,light of the drain of oil imports on our,104
NA,"overseas reserves, the proposals of the",104
NA,Government are paltry; and in the light of,104
NA,"the threat to our national security, the",104
NA,Government's proposals are truly tragic.,104
NA,It would be much more in accord with,104
NA,"reality if the Government were providing,",104
NA,"not £4,000,000 a year, but at least twenty",104
NA,times that much for oil search. The,104
NA,Attorney-General smiles. He thinks that,104
NA,is ridiculous. Let me cite figures to show,104
NA,what is being done in other countries. The,104
NA,four-year plan for the search for oil in,104
NA,Australia issued by the Australian Petro-,104
NA,leum Exploration Association shows that in,104
NA,J960 only 22 wells were drilled throughout,104
NA,"Australia. By way of comparison, let us",104
NA,see what happened in Canada and the,104
NA,"United States of America, both of which",104
NA,already have surplus oil production. In,104
NA,"1960, when we drilled 22 holes, Canada",104
NA,drilled 920 exploratory wells and the United,104
NA,"States of America drilled 11,704 explora-",104
NA,tory wells.,104
NA,Mr Chresby -Yo u are out of date. 1,104
NA,quoted those figures in the House a couple,104
NA,of months ago.,104
Mr ALLAN FRASER ,The y are very some,104
NA,important. They bear being quoted again.,104
NA,The .honorable member for Griffith will,104
NA,know the significance of the,104
NA,""" exploratory wells "".",104
NA,Mr Chresby - I do.,104
Mr ALLAN FRASER ,I n Canada and this paragraph-,104
NA,the United States probably four times as,104
NA,many wells as that were drilled. 1 have,104
NA,simply quoted the number of exploratory,104
NA,wells.,104
NA,Mr Chresby -The y are all shallow,104
NA,wells.,104
Mr ALLAN FRASER , I hope the,104
NA,but honorable member does not mind my quot-,104
NA,ing the figures which he says he quoted in,104
NA,this place some time ago. At least he will,104
NA,agree that the provision which is being made,104
NA,by the Australian Government for the,104
NA,search for oil is quite paltry and insigni-,104
NA,ficant in relation to the need to find oil in,104
NA,this country and in relation to what is being,104
NA,done in other countries. I do not know,104
NA,whether the honorable member quoted the,104
NA,figures relating to Communist China. Com-,104
NA,"munist China, with a sedimentary area",104
NA,"equal to about 20 per cent, of that in Aus-",104
NA,"tralia, currently has 900 exploratory teams",104
NA,and 480 rigs in use.,104
NA,"The ""Financial Review"" of 14th Sep-",104
NA,"tember contains an article by J. G. Fuller,",104
NA,who will be recognized by my friend oppo-,104
NA,site as being an authority on this matter.,104
NA,Mr Fuller said-,104
NA,In 1960 Australia's total exploratory effort was,104
NA,the equilavent of approximately one day's explora-,104
NA,tion in the United States of America.,104
NA,That is in spite of the fact that our need for,104
NA,and our dependence upon oil are infinitely,104
NA,greater than is the case in the United States,104
NA,"of America, which has within its boundaries",104
NA,about one-third of the total crude oil re-,104
NA,sources of the world. We in Australia are,104
NA,not even using the full services of the seis-,104
NA,mic survey crews that are available to,104
NA,us. Those men are standing by; some of,104
NA,them are idle and some are working part-,104
NA,time. It is essential lhat we should employ,104
NA,"them to the full. The urgent, immediate",104
NA,need is to have a supply of targets ahead,104
NA,of drilling activity. It is claimed that if the,104
NA,seismic crews now in Australia were fully,104
NA,employed some 35 or 40 targets a year,104
NA,"could be found, giving a real prospect of",104
NA,success in the search for oil. It seems,104
NA,"to be almost criminal, in the light of our",104
NA,"desperate need to find oil, that any seismic",104
NA,term survey crew should be idle.,104
NA,A little while ago I referred to the Aus-,104
NA,tralian Petroleum Exploration Association's,104
NA,four-year plan for Australia. I now quote,104
NA,There are in Australia a* present fourteen com-,104
NA,"mercial seismic crews which, fully employed,",104
NA,"would cost £2,500,000 annually. The number of",104
NA,crews could be readily doubled or trebled as the,104
NA,need arose. Those crews would be expected to,104
NA,uncover 35 drilling targets per year. The higher,104
NA,rale of seismic subsidy suggested above for the,104
NA,next two years is designed to overcome a cur-,105
NA,rently desperate position. So far from seismic,105
NA,being two years ahead of the drill with a> respec-,105
NA,table number of drilling targets established,105
NA,"now, the fact is that at the end of July",105
NA,"The association is referring to July, 1961-",105
NA,there will not be one drilling target delineated,105
NA,by detailed seismic with established closure,105
NA,for the drill.,105
NA,That is an extraordinary indictment of the,105
NA,Government for its failure to make an,105
NA,energetic effort to find oil in this country.,105
NA,This is the other side of the picture:,105
NA,What would happen if a subsidized drilling,105
NA,company did produce commercial oil in,105
NA,Australia? The Minister for National,105
NA,Development is empowered to make,105
NA,"arangements with these companies, but the",105
NA,legislation does not provide what shall be,105
NA,set out in those agreements. I understand,105
NA,that the agreements which the Minister has,105
NA,made provide that if a private company,105
NA,finds commercial oil in Australia it must,105
NA,refund to the Australian Government the,105
NA,amount which the Government has paid,105
NA,by way of subsidy. What an extra-,105
NA,ordinarily generous provision that is for the,105
NA,company at the expense of the Australian,105
NA,taxpayer! It is just like my making an,105
NA,arrangement with the Minister for Labour,105
NA,"and National Service ( Mr MCMahon), who",105
NA,"is now at the table, to share the cost of a",105
NA,"ticket in a £100,000 lottery on the condition",105
NA,that if we won I would refund to him half,105
NA,of the cost of the ticket and I would take,105
NA,"the £100,000. The Government is putting",105
NA,up approximately half of the cost of drilling,105
NA,operations in Australia. I f drilling opera-,105
NA,"tions succeed, the Government will get",105
NA,back merely what it put up and the private,105
NA,company will reap the whole of the benefit.,105
NA,Mr Chresby -Tha t is not correct.,105
Mr ALLAN FRASER ,Perhap s the,105
NA,honorable member will be able to explain,105
NA,later what is not correct about it. The,105
NA,"position is that, if a private company",105
NA,"found commercial oil in Australia, it would",105
NA,be required to pay to the Government the,105
NA,amount which the Government has,105
NA,advanced to it by way of subsidy.,105
NA,Mr Chresby -Wha t about the taxation,105
NA,angle?,105
Mr ALLAN FRASER ,Don' t be silly?,105
NA,"I am saying that, although we put up half",105
NA,"the cost of finding the oil, all we would get",105
NA,back would be that half of the cost; but,105
NA,as of the immense riches that may flow from,105
NA,the finding of the oil would all belong to,105
NA,the private company which had put up the,105
NA,other half of the cost. The company,105
NA,ready would get the lot; the Australian taxpayer,105
NA,would get nothing.,105
NA,The position would be bad enough if,105
NA,these companies were controlled by Aus-,105
NA,tralian interests. The fact is that 80 per,105
NA,"cent, of the oil leases in Australia are now",105
NA,under the domination or control of,105
NA,foreign corporations. I expect that the,105
NA,honorable member for Griffith will not,105
NA,deny that.,105
NA,Mr Buchanan -Tha t is not correct.,105
NA,Mr ALL AN FRASER -I t is not 80,105
NA,per cent.?,105
NA,Mr Buchanan -No .,105
Mr ALLAN FRASER ,Perhap s the,105
NA,"honorable member knows better than I , but",105
NA,my impression is that the Union company,105
NA,and the Kern County organization have,105
NA,acquired an overwhelming share of the,105
NA,Australian shareholding in Australian Oil,105
NA,and Gas Corporation Limited.,105
NA,Mr Buchanan -Yo u are right there.,105
NA,"Eighty per cent, of that lease has been",105
NA,acquired. But the figure for the whole of,105
NA,Australia is not 80 per cent.,105
Mr ALLAN FRASER ,Th e informa-,105
NA,tion available to me is that foreign,105
NA,corporations now control or own 80 per,105
NA,"cent, of the oil leases in Australia.",105
NA,Mr Cairns -D o you dispute that?,105
NA,Mr Buchanan -Yes .,105
Mr ALLAN FRASER ,W e are putting,105
NA,"up half the cost of the search for oil, but",105
NA,if oil were found in commercial quantities,105
NA,a tremendous national resource would,105
NA,pass into foreign hands and we would find,105
NA,ourselves in the position in which so many,105
NA,other countries have found themselves,105
NA,when their oil resources have been,105
NA,exploited to enrich a few American multi-,105
NA,millionaires. The people of Australia would,105
NA,obtain no benefit from the discovery of,105
NA,oil. When account is taken of the,105
NA,"£2,000,000,000 which this Government has",105
NA,"spent on so-called defence, much of it hav-",106
NA,ing been wasted and there being nothing,106
NA,whatever left to indicate such expendi-,106
NA,ture-,106
NA,Mr Anderson -Tha t is absolute rubbish.,106
Mr ALLAN FRASER ,Th e honorable,106
NA,member for Hume says that that is rub-,106
NA,bish. I say that of the amount of approxi-,106
NA,"mately £200,000.000 a year spent on so-",106
NA,"called defence, more than half-tha t is,",106
NA,"more than £100,000,000-i s spent on",106
NA,"wages, clothing, food and other consumable",106
NA,items of which nothing whatever is left at,106
NA,the end of the year. Does the honorable,106
NA,member accept that as being correct?,106
NA,Mr Anderson -Yo u have to feed them.,106
NA,Mr MCMahon -Yo u must have trained,106
NA,man-power.,106
Mr ALLAN FRASER ,Wha t is the,106
NA,Minister talking about? There is nothing to,106
NA,show for it.,106
NA,Mr Buchanan -Ther e are the men.,106
Mr ALLAN FRASER ,Go d bless my tralia,106
NA,"heart and soul. Of course, we have the men.",106
NA,We shall always have the men of this overseas,106
NA,country. But we also need equipment. We,106
NA,do not just need men. It is perfectly nonfor,106
NA,sensical to put men up against machines,106
NA,in a modern war. For more than half of the,106
NA,"£200,000,000 spent, there is nothing",106
NA,"the form of capital equipment, machinery,",106
NA,"weapons of war, and all the things that",106
NA,would be of some use if an enemy attacked.,106
NA,The Government would have done far,106
NA,better to spend a large proportion of that,106
NA,"£200,000,000 on finding oil in Australia,",106
NA,because without local supplies of oil we year.,106
NA,would not be able to defend this country,106
NA,for twelve weeks if the sea lanes were cut by,106
NA,the enemy.,106
NA,Mr Chresby - I made a speech in May,106
NA,in which I forecast that oil would be found,106
NA,in Queensland in twelve months.,106
Mr ALLAN FRASER ,Th e honorable,106
NA,member for Griffith apparently made a,106
NA,"fine speech. I shall look it up in "" Hansard "" discoveries were made.",106
NA,and read every word of it with the utmost,106
NA,"appreciation, just as I am sure he is",106
NA,"ing what I have to say, as for the first",106
NA,"in our political careers, and I am afraid",106
NA,"for the last time, we seem to be in entire",106
NA,agreement.,106
NA,"Even if it were desirable to do so, Aus-",106
NA,"tralia could not, before at least one major",106
NA,"discovery was made, obtain from the inter-",106
NA,national oil industry the sort of capital that,106
NA,we require if we are adequately to explore,106
NA,our country for oil. There is only one source,106
NA,from which the money we need to explore,106
NA,this country for oil can come from. It can,106
NA,come only from the national income of this,106
NA,"country, from the Treasury of this country,",106
NA,from the Consolidated Revenue. There is,106
NA,no other place from which we can get the,106
NA,money until a major profitable discovery is,106
NA,"made, because the history of the inter-",106
NA,national oil companies is that they are not,106
NA,prepared to spend money on any large scale,106
NA,until a substantial discovery mas been made.,106
NA,Mr Turnbull -Tha t is why money is,106
NA,"being spent in America, as you said.",106
Mr ALLAN FRASER ,Th e honorable,106
NA,member for Mallee is quite right. That,106
NA,is why the money is spent in America.,106
NA,That is why we must have substantial,106
NA,expenditure from the public purse in Aus-,106
NA,in order to make at least the first,106
NA,major oil discovery before we can attract,106
NA,capital in adequate quantity for tbe,106
NA,"search, if we then require overseas capital",106
NA,that purpose. The international industry,106
NA,provides most of the exploration capital to,106
NA,those areas where discoveries have already,106
NA,left in been made and where the chance of,106
NA,further discovery is considered good. In,106
NA,"Australia, I think, at present the inter-",106
NA,"national oil industry is providing, at most,",106
NA,"about £10,000,000 a year towards oil",106
NA,"search, and I think Australian investors are",106
NA,"providing, at most, about £5,000,000 a",106
NA,"In North Africa, practically no industry",106
NA,capital was available for exploration until,106
NA,the discoveries were made in ihe French,106
NA,Sahara. But once those discoveries were,106
NA,"made, immense amounts of capital were",106
NA,available for oil search right throughout,106
NA,"the whole of North Africa, even in areas",106
NA,very remote from the area in which the oil,106
NA,I suggest that,106
NA,Australian investors cannot be expected to,106
NA,"enjoyput up more than £5,000,000 a year for",106
NA,time oil search. That is on the basis that of,106
NA,"approximately £400,000.000 of new capital",106
NA,that becomes available each year for invest-,106
NA,"ment of all sorts, not more than £7,000,000",106
NA,"is available for all forms of speculation,",107
NA,"including mining, whaling and oil search.",107
NA,"So the amount of money available to us,",107
NA,unless the Government itself provides a,107
NA,"greatly increased amount, is very limited",107
NA,indeed.,107
NA,"If we depended solely, as this Govern-",107
NA,ment appears to be prepared to let us,107
NA,"largely depend, upon Australian private",107
NA,"investment to discover oil in Australia, it",107
NA,would take from 50 to 100 years just to,107
NA,explore the Australian mainland alone.,107
NA,That is assuming that no further exploration,107
NA,work were done in New Guinea. If we,107
NA,took New Guinea into account and left it,107
NA,to Australian private investment to pro-,107
NA,"vide funds for the search, it would take",107
NA,from 70 to 140 years to explore all the,107
NA,available areas. Even assuming that over-,107
NA,"seas funds of £10,000,000 a year continued",107
NA,to be available-the y are available at that,107
NA,rate only because of the encouragement,107
NA,given by the Cabawin discovery-i t would,107
NA,take about 40 years to explore the Australian,107
NA,"mainland and New Guinea, or about 30",107
NA,years to explore the mainland of Australia,107
NA,"only. Most certainly, we have not that",107
NA,amount of time left to us. We cannot go,107
NA,"on spending at least 10 per cent, of our",107
NA,total import bill to bring oil into this,107
NA,"country. We cannot afford, from the point",107
NA,of view of the survival of this nation and,107
NA,from the point of view of its successful,107
NA,"defence, to continue to be the one continent",107
NA,without an oil discovery.,107
NA,"Therefore, apart altogether from the",107
NA,question of the desirability of allowing,107
NA,"private capital to conduct the oil search,",107
NA,it must be clear that if we are to pro-,107
NA,ceed with the search at the speed which,107
NA,is justified by the urgency of the national,107
NA,"need, there must be a substantial provision",107
NA,pf funds from the public purse for this,107
NA,"purpose, at least to the point where one",107
NA,major discovery has been made. At that,107
NA,"point, private capital is certain to be",107
NA,available in sufficient quantity to prosecute,107
NA,"the search for further wells, but the ques-",107
NA,tion would still remain whether such,107
NA,"capital should be used and, if it is used,",107
NA,what conditions and restrictions should be,107
NA,imposed to keep the major control of Aus-,107
NA,tralian oil resources always in Australian,107
NA,hands.,107
NA,"In the view of the Labour Party, the",107
NA,desirable aim would be to develop all our,107
NA,"oil resources under public ownership, pre-",107
NA,"venting in this country the ruthless, un-",107
NA,scrupulous exploitation which other coun-,107
NA,tries have suffered at the greedy hands of,107
NA,the powerful international oil interests. It,107
NA,"might be necessary, however, after the",107
NA,"first major discovery has been made, to",107
NA,use some overseas capital to provide for,107
NA,"further large-scale development, and to",107
NA,"provide the equipment and services which,",107
NA,"if paid for, by local funds, would adver-",107
NA,sely affect our trade balances.,107
NA,Mr MCMahon -Woul d Harry Jensen,107
NA,agree with that last part about exploitation,107
NA,of these resources by the Government?,107
Mr ALLAN FRASER ,Yes . The,107
NA,capital cost of a drilling rig and equipment,107
NA,"is a large part of the cost of drilling,",107
NA,"just as the capital costs of collection,",107
NA,"transport, storage and refining are a large",107
NA,part of the development cost. We might,107
NA,have to decide whether we would borrow,107
NA,some money from overseas to pay for the,107
NA,overseas equipment or whether we would,107
NA,allow overseas investors to come in. That,107
NA,is a question for the future.,107
NA,The immediate position is that we must,107
NA,provide the funds from our own resources,107
NA,and must maintain Australian public con-,107
NA,"trol of the oil, when it is found. We could,",107
NA,"of course, as France, Italy and Argentina",107
NA,"have done, make all the effort ourselves",107
NA,to provide the required funds. We could,107
NA,do that without allowing foreign or overseas,107
NA,"capital to share in our oil industry, even",107
NA,"if it meant, perhaps, some temporary belt-",107
NA,tightening after the promised oil riches,107
NA,had been found until their profitable de-,107
NA,velopment for the eventual benefit of the,107
NA,whole of the people of Australia rather,107
NA,than for the benefit of the few multi-,107
NA,millionaires of the kind that the Attorney-,107
NA,General ( Sir Garfield Barwick) has rep-,107
NA,resented so ably during most of his pro-,107
NA,fessional career and that he is now rep-,107
NA,resenting equally ably in this Parliament.,107
NA,"However, the prospect of a major discovery",107
NA,of an oil field in Australia is absolutely,107
NA,"remote, if we can judge from the scale",107
NA,of the present Government's provision for,107
NA,oil search. The Government's policy ap-,107
NA,"pears to be based on two premises, each",107
NA,of which is entirely false. The first is that,107
NA,oil can be found quickly and easily-al l,107
NA,experience elsewhere in the world proves,107
NA,"that it cannot-an d secondly, that it is",108
NA,not a national task to find oil; that it is,108
NA,not the job of the Government to find oil.,108
NA,"Actually, it is an essential and primary",108
NA,task of the Government to find the oil,108
NA,that we need for our own protection and,108
NA,for the maintenance of this country. All,108
NA,the facts are against the propositions on,108
NA,which the Government's policy apparently,108
NA,is based.,108
NA,The lackadaisical and reluctant attitude,108
NA,of the Government towards its national,108
NA,obligation in the search for oil was under-,108
NA,lined last year when the Government em-,108
NA,ployed the Petroleum Institute of France,108
NA,10 advise us on how and where to find oil,108
NA,in Australia. Why did it choose the French,108
NA,institute? It did so because of the finds,108
NA,in the Sahara. It was considered that the,108
NA,French were the experts in this field and,108
NA,"should be brought in to advise us, but the",108
NA,Government took no account of the fact,108
NA,that oil was found in the Sahara because,108
NA,the French Government had spent,108
NA,"£45,000,000 in an area of 220,000 square",108
NA,miles before it made a profitable strike.,108
NA,It has gone on spending at the rate of,108
NA,"£25,000,000 a year in every year since",108
NA,then to discover further quantities of oil.,108
NA,It is not of much use to bring in the,108
NA,greatest experts in the world to advise us,108
NA,on how to go about the search for oil,108
NA,unless we are prepared to undertake the,108
NA,search and to undertake it on a sufficient,108
NA,"scale. In the meantime, if the Govern-",108
NA,ment is not prepared to put up the neces-,108
NA,sary money to bring about a vigorous search,108
NA,"for oil in Australia, it can at least take",108
NA,"steps, which are open to it, to speed the",108
NA,rate of exploration by private companies.,108
NA,A most extraordinary position exists,108
NA,at present in that there is no legislative,108
NA,obligation on the companies which obtain,108
NA,011 tenements. There is no obligation on,108
NA,them whatever to spend any specific,108
NA,amount of money in any given area or to,108
NA,develop the tenements of which they have,108
NA,"gained possession. These, I know, are",108
NA,matters that are controlled by the State,108
NA,"governments, but it is perfectly possible",108
NA,for this Government to make arrangements,108
NA,with a State. The obvious tendency at,108
NA,present is for companies to take up very,108
NA,"large areas, with no relation whatever to the",108
NA,amount of exploration that they intend to,108
NA,make or to their capacity to make it.,108
NA,The only sedimentary basin areas that,108
NA,are now not held under tenement are in,108
NA,"Papua, New Guinea, the Northern Terri-",108
NA,"tory and Tasmania, apart from a few off-",108
NA,shore areas. All the rest of the sedimentary,108
NA,basins on the mainland and in Papua are,108
NA,"already held by companies which, as I",108
NA,"have said, are chiefly controlled by foreign",108
NA,capital. It would seem obvious that if,108
NA,exploration is to be carried out at a,108
NA,"satisfactory rate, the area held should be",108
NA,related to the capacity to carry out ex-,108
NA,ploratory work and to the amount of work,108
NA,actually being performed. It appears at,108
NA,present that there are companies which are,108
NA,"simply squatting, with no intention of doing",108
NA,any serious work in the areas they hold;,108
NA,they are waiting and hoping that some,108
NA,other company which is spending money,108
NA,"will make a discovery, whereupon they will",108
NA,reap a rich profit from their leases.,108
NA,In the last moments avilable to me I,108
NA,"return to my main theme, which is that if",108
NA,we as a nation want to be sure of finding,108
NA,oil-an d of course we do; we must find,108
NA,"it, and it is there; every expert agrees on",108
NA,that-w e must be prepared to make the,108
NA,"search a national task, financed from the",108
NA,"national purse, and we must at least under-",108
NA,take intensive exploration of those few,108
NA,areas where indications are generally pretty,108
NA,favorable.,108
NA,Mr Forbes -Yo u are boring everybody,108
NA,in the House.,108
Mr ALLAN FRASER ,Th e honorable,108
NA,member from South Australia declares that,108
NA,he is bored by what I am saying. He,108
NA,thereby declares that he is not interested,108
NA,in the question of the search for oil in,108
NA,Australia.,108
NA,"Mr Forbes -No , that is not correct.",108
Mr ALLAN FRASER ,H e has said,108
NA,that he is bored. His constituents must be,108
NA,easily satisfied if they are satisfied with,108
NA,him. I imagine they will not be satisfied,108
NA,with him for much longer.,108
NA,With the capita] provided from the public,108
NA,"purse, the equipment and the technical skills",108
NA,"can be imported. They are available, not",108
NA,only in the United States of America but,108
NA,"also in Great Britain, France and Germany.",108
NA,Why should not the Government imme-,108
NA,"diately determine to explore, say, four or five",108
NA,"of the most favorable areas, which would",108
NA,"cost from £20,000,000 to £50,000,000?",108
NA,That task could be carried out in the course,109
NA,of a very few years and the rewards that,109
NA,might flow from it are incalculable in bene-,109
NA,fits for the Australian people; nor would it,109
NA,"require a large government staff. Actually,",109
NA,it would require only a small group of ex-,109
NA,"perienced and vigorous oil searchers, with",109
NA,no restrictions placed upon them in the,109
NA,planning and carrying out of the operation.,109
NA,That is the kind of policy which the Labour,109
NA,"Party has in mind, instead of the niggardly",109
NA,and quite unrealistic proposals contained,109
NA,in the Government's legislation.,109
NA,"On behalf of the Opposition, as an amend-",109
NA,"ment to the motion for the second reading,",109
NA,I move-,109
NA,"That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a",109
NA,view to inserting the following words in place,109
NA,"thereof:- "" this House is of opinion that the",109
NA,Government should lead and hasten the search,109
NA,for oil by developing the activities of the Bureau,109
NA,"of Mineral Resources in mapping, in geological and",109
NA,"geophysical surveys and in drilling, and shouid",109
NA,undertake research into the production of oil,109
NA,"coal and shale."".",109
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Hon. VV. C.,109
NA,Haworth) -Order ! Is the amendment,109
NA,seconded?,109
NA,Mr Cairns -Yes . I second the amend-,109
NA,ment.,109
Mr BUCHANAN ,MCMillan) [11.56] -,109
NA,The honorable member for Eden-Monaro,109
NA,( Mr Allan Fraser) has given us some very,109
NA,"interesting figures, the great majority of",109
NA,which were accurate. I am grateful to,109
NA,him in some respects. He has given us an,109
NA,outline of some of the activities in the search,109
NA,for oil which it is worthwhile to have on,109
NA,record. His comments will probably save,109
NA,me from making similar references as I,109
NA,"proceed with my speech. However, 1",109
NA,thought that the honorable member was quite,109
NA,irresponsible in advocating an increase in,109
NA,expenditure on the scale envisaged by him.,109
NA,Mr Bryant -Why ?,109
Mr BUCHANAN ,Becaus e there is a,109
NA,limit to the amount that the taxpayers can,109
NA,provide. The honorable member referred,109
NA,"to an amount of £80,000,000 for one item.",109
NA,Not so long ago we heard the Leader of the,109
NA,Opposition ( Mr Calwell) telling us of the,109
NA,hundreds of millions of pounds that the,109
NA,Australian Labour Party proposed to spend,109
NA,on various projects if it were returned to,109
NA,office after the forthcoming general election.,109
NA,He has told us what ought to be done about,109
NA,"many things, but the expenditure would",109
NA,reach such astronomical proportions that,109
NA,the taxpayers would not be able to bear it.,109
NA,The amendment moved by the honorable,109
NA,member for Eden-Monaro is really only,109
NA,fiddling with the question. This Govern-,109
NA,ment has had experience over the years in,109
NA,"the search for oil, whereas the Labour Party",109
NA,"has not. In 1957, the Government pro-",109
NA,vided a subsidy towards the cost of strati-,109
NA,graphic drilling. It also extended tax con-,109
NA,cessions on capital investment in companies,109
NA,"engaged in that work. It did so, very",109
NA,"largely, because it believes in doing things",109
NA,methodically and properly. The honorable,109
NA,member for Eden-Monaro did not mention,109
NA,those matters. The Government took,109
NA,these steps very largely for the purpose,109
NA,of getting information on the geo-,109
NA,logical character of the particular basins in,109
NA,which oil could possible occur. We should,109
NA,take notice of the fact that people did say,109
NA,from at that time that Australia was too old a,109
NA,"country to produce oil, and that oil does",109
NA,not occur south of the equator. Certainly,109
NA,there is more oil produced north of the,109
NA,"equator, but that is mainly because of the",109
NA,greater land masses there. With some-,109
NA,"thing like 87 per cent, of the earth's sur-",109
NA,face being situated north of the equator,109
NA,one would expect to find more oil there.,109
NA,"After all, oil has been found in most of",109
NA,the countries of the world today. Austra-,109
NA,"lia, as the honorable member for Eden",109
NA,"Monaro said, is one place where oil has",109
NA,not been found in commercial quantities,109
NA,although it is urgently needed. I could,109
NA,not agree more with what he said in that,109
NA,"regard, but he wants to do what is neces-",109
NA,sary too fast. It is known that two-thirds,109
NA,of Australia's geological formations were,109
NA,laid down in the same oil-making condi-,109
NA,tions and in the same geological ages as,109
NA,many of the oil-producing formations in,109
NA,other parts of the world. But when we,109
NA,went into this in the first place no one had,109
NA,"discovered more than traces of oil, in",109
NA,"deepwater bores, for example, although",109
NA,there had been good signs of petroliferous,109
NA,gas in Roma as far back as 1900.,109
NA,Now we are confirmed in the knowledge,109
NA,"that there is oil in this continent, because",109
NA,at Cabawin it flowed up from a depth of,109
NA,"10,000 ft. through a pipe only 5/16ths",109
NA,"of an inch in diameter, giving 2.000 gallons",109
NA,a day. and was accompanied by thousands,109
NA,"of cubic feet of petroliferous gas, but it",109
NA,is too far from the market to be called a,110
NA,commercial proposition. During the last,110
NA,recess I was fortunate enough to see the,110
NA,actual site of this strike. I and some other,110
NA,members of the Government Members',110
NA,"Mining Committee, which has taken such",110
NA,"a keen interest in oil search, visited that",110
NA,part of Queensland to see for ourselves,110
NA,just how the search was carried out. We,110
NA,saw it from the seismic teams working on,110
NA,"the job, right through to the drilling of",110
NA,the well. We even watched sadly the dis-,110
NA,"mantling of one giant rig from a dry hole,",110
NA,ready for transport to the next site. The,110
NA,thing that worried us most was that the,110
NA,company was not able to go on immediately,110
NA,and spud in a new well because the delay,110
NA,in producing seismic information is seri-,110
NA,ously lagging behind the drilling capacity,110
NA,owing to lack of funds. But the Govern-,110
NA,"ment, in this bill, is taking a lot of steps",110
NA,to overcome this deficiency. It is being,110
NA,"done as fast as Australia can afford,",110
NA,although not as fast as the honorable,110
NA,member for Eden-Monaro would like.,110
NA,"The Cabawin strike, plus the natural",110
NA,flow found by an Australian company at,110
NA,Roma where the electricity generating,110
NA,station is now being supplied with power,110
NA,"piped directly from the hole, gives every",110
NA,indication that we are at last beginning to,110
NA,break into the early stages of having,110
NA,and oil discovered in this country in comis,110
NA,mercial quantities. Since those discoveries,110
NA,the activity has been stepped up. Investcan,110
NA,ment in the oil search is much greater,110
NA,and we are doing all we can to keep,110
NA,"oil rig actively drilling, by increasing",110
NA,activities in seismic work.,110
NA,This bill will assist to some extent,110
NA,"overcoming the difficulty we have had, as",110
NA,it proposes to increase the actual amount,110
NA,"of money available for the search, although",110
NA,this will have to be shared by more and,110
NA,more companies coming in because,110
NA,realize that we will ultimately find oil.,110
NA,One of the most important things in this,110
NA,legislation is the change in the emphasis,110
NA,on the requirements of the Bureau of,110
NA,Mineral Resources. [Quorum formed.],110
NA,Until now the subsidy has been approved,110
NA,only for projects likely to increase,110
NA,bureau's knowledge of the stratigraphic,110
NA,formations. I have heard this called neversubsidy,110
NA,"never geology, because although it is necesfused,",110
NA,"sary as a starting-off point, you never",110
NA,never find oil in that way. Now this legis-,110
NA,lation makes it possible for the subsidy to,110
NA,be granted for detailed exploration of geo-,110
NA,"logical structures and for test drilling,",110
NA,without the inhibition of having to bring,110
NA,up new stratigraphical information of a,110
NA,regional character.,110
NA,"As honorable members well know, oil",110
NA,collects in sedimentary basins and the,110
NA,problem is to locate the enclosed forma-,110
NA,tions. The main tool that the operator has,110
NA,in discovering these is the seismic apparatus.,110
NA,"It cos;s £4,000 a week to keep a seismic",110
NA,"team in the field, but even with the infor-",110
NA,mation that that gives about contours and,110
NA,"levels under the surface, it cannot tell the",110
NA,porosity of the sandstones. It can tell only,110
NA,where the right sort of enclosed basin,110
NA,"exists, and the extent of it. Once that is",110
NA,established you can find oil only by drilling.,110
NA,The Government realizes the urgency of,110
NA,the need for discovering oil in Australia,110
NA,and has stepped up the subsidy from,110

NA,Although the Minister for National De-,110
NA,"velopment (Senator Spooner), who is in",110
NA,"gas another place, has said that this amount",110
NA,what his department thinks is about the,110
NA,limit that the companies searching for oil,110
NA,"use, they do not agree with his esti-",110
NA,now mate. The Minister has indicated that in,110
NA,every his opinion a crash programme is not,110
NA,"our warranted. The programme we propose,",110
NA,"based on steady examination and testing,",110
NA,"is sufficient. The use of the term "" crash",110
NA,"in programme"" was perhaps unfortunate",110
NA,because it implies the idea of a considerable,110
NA,amount of wildcatting. But the plan put,110
NA,forward by the Australian Petroleum Ex-,110
NA,"ploration Association is, as the honorable",110
NA,"they member for Eden-Monaro mentioned,",110
NA,intended to provide a basis for forward,110
NA,"planning, so that the twelve drilling rigs",110
NA,now in Australia can be kept working at,110
NA,"their capacity of about 50 wells a year,",110
NA,although last year we drilled only 22 wells.,110
NA,An examination of the report by the,110
NA,the Minister on the 1959 act for the year,110
NA,1960-61 shows that 89 applications for,110
NA,were dealt with and 31 were re-,110
NA,while 44 applications were approved.,110
NA,There were only 44 applications approved,110
NA,to seek oil in 24 sedimentary basins of a,111
NA,"total of 1,362.000 square miles. But even",111
NA,the basic exploration of these basins has,111
NA,yet to be done.,111
NA,Mr Daly - I rise to a point of order. At,111
NA,"12.10 a.m., is it in order for an honorable",111
NA,member to speak when no one is listening,111
NA,to him?,111
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,N o point of,111
NA,order is involved.,111
Mr BUCHANAN , 1 have listened to a,111
NA,lot of rubbish from the honorable member,111
NA,for Grayndler for a good while. It is the,111
NA,Government's intention that the effort in,111
NA,this basic exploration will be a concerted,111
NA,effort.,111
NA,Tn the year of which I speak-1960-61 -,111
NA,"the amount appropriated was £1,400,000,",111
NA,"of which £1,399,000 was spent. The com-",111
NA,panies concerned have indicated their in-,111
NA,tention to carry out further works to the,111
NA,"value of £1,589,000. At the time that the",111
NA,report was published these works had not,111
NA,been started. Against this background the,111
NA,Australian Petroleum Exploration Associa-,111
NA,tion has submitted a projected programme,111
NA,which shows that for the year ending,111
NA,"December, 1962, the Australian companies",111
NA,"expect to raise £3,156,000, and that the",111
NA,overseas companies will probably have more,111
NA,"than £4,850,000 available to spend in Aus-",111
NA,tralia. Those figures do not bring us to the,111
NA,level that the honorable member for Eden-,111
NA,"Monaro wants, but they are practical figures",111
NA,which we should be able to manage.,111
NA,"Based on that level, and so that we can",111
NA,"do some forward planning, such as bringing",111
NA,"more seismic crews from overseas, the",111
NA,A.P.E.A. submitted a programme to be,111
NA,"spread over four years, which the honorable",111
NA,member for Eden-Monaro has covered. The,111
NA,"amount the A.P.E.A. suggests, together with",111
NA,"the subsidy, is £6,000,000 a year for two",111
NA,"years to step up the lag in seismic surveys,",111
NA,"followed by £5,000,000 and then by",111
NA,"£4,000,000, with a drilling programme to",111
NA,"match amounting to £5,000,000 in the. first",111
NA,"years, £7,000,000 in trie next, £8,000,000",111
NA,"in the next and finally rising to £9,000,000.",111
NA,"As the information becomes available, the",111
NA,work can be stepped up. The total amount,111
NA,over the four years would be something like,111
NA,"the £50,000,000 of which the honorable",111
NA,"member for Eden-Monaro spoke finally,",111
NA,although previously he had been speaking,111
NA,"of £80,000,000, which, I submit, was",111
NA,fantastic.,111
NA,The actual subsidy needed to implement,111
NA,"the programme would be £5,500,000 in the",111
NA,"first year and £6,500,000 in each of the",111
NA,"following three years. This, I agree, would",111
NA,not be a high price to pay for a major,111
NA,breakthrough in the search for oil. I should,111
NA,"like to emphasize, Mr Speaker, that",111
NA,although this plan was proposed by the,111
NA,Australian Petroleum Exploration Associa-,111
NA,tion the association does not suggest that we,111
NA,should keep the whole of the effort in the,111
NA,hands of Australian companies. It is well,111
NA,recognized that the expert knowledge and,111
NA,ready finance provided by the large overseas,111
NA,oil companies has been of tremendous value,111
NA,"in Australia needed, and still needs.",111
NA,One of the basic reasons for overseas,111
NA,companies coming here is that the areas of,111
NA,the leases granted by the State Governments,111
NA,are mostly much too large for any one group,111
NA,to explore adequately. It is laid down that,111
NA,certain works must be undertaken in respect,111
NA,"of each lease, but there should be no",111
NA,obstacle to a take-over of unprospected,111
NA,areas by the many interests now coming,111
NA,forward and seeking a place in Australian,111
NA,exploration.,111
NA,programme showing what it considers the,111
NA,"Mr Speaker, the Australian Petroleum",111
NA,Exploration Association has put up this,111
NA,and the foreseeable contribution of the,111
NA,overseas companies which are vitally,111
NA,interested in discovering oil in Australia.,111
NA,The figures are considerably in excess of,111
NA,those provided for in this bill. The indus-,111
NA,try no doubt believes that it can fulfil its,111
NA,Australian market is capable of providing,111
NA,in giving the impetus that the search for oil,111
NA,"part of the programme. If it can do this,",111
NA,I know that it will find the Government to,111
NA,be entirely sympathetic with its ambitions.,111
NA,I can assure the industry of the fullest co-,111
NA,operation of the Government Members',111
NA,"Mining Committee, which will use its in-",111
NA,fluence to the full lo urge the Government,111
NA,to match whatever sums the industry finds,111
NA,it can usefully employ in this direction.,111
NA,We are confident that our representations,111
NA,would be very favourably received. The,111
NA,Minister has stated his faith that oil exists,111
NA,in Australia and that the finding of it is,111
NA,"only a matter of time, depending on the",112
NA,intensity of the search. I am sure that if,112
NA,the industry itself will accept the challenge,112
NA,"of intensifying the search, the Government",112
NA,will be prepared to consider sympathetically,112
NA,representations for an increase in its,112
NA,contribution.,112
NA,There is another point in this legislation,112
NA,on which I would like to touch. I am very,112
NA,pleased to see the inclusion of a footage,112
NA,formula as a basis for subsidy. This,112
NA,posal was suggested by the Government,112
NA,Members' Mining Committee because it,112
NA,believes that too much frustration and,112
NA,delay have been occasioned by all the,112
NA,paper work that has to be gone through,112
NA,establish costs. There is also a waste,112
NA,effort because of the inevitable red tape,112
NA,of departmental checking. It is believed,112
NA,that too many plans have been on a rather,112
NA,"extravagant basis, and that in certain",112
NA,it has been possible to do a little juggling,112
NA,with subsidiary operating companies,112
NA,tendering for holding companies. With a,112
NA,known amount of subsidy on the basis of,112
NA,footage drilled-i n the case of seismic,112
NA,work it would have to be on the basis,112
NA,a distance covered- a company considerdrilling,112
NA,ing a specific project would know just what,112
NA,"it would receive in the way of assistance,",112
NA,and could budget accordingly. The departto,112
NA,ment would know just how many feet of,112
NA,"drilling it would get for a specific sum, and",112
NA,both parties would eliminate a lot of,112
NA,guesswork and complicated cross-checking.,112
NA,I am of the opinion that we would make,112
NA,very considerably savings on the subsidy,112
NA,if there were a known limitation accordinformation,112
NA,ing to footage drilled. The companies,112
NA,concerned would need to trim their plans,112
NA,to make the utmost use of the funds avail-,112
NA,able-the y would cut down on some of,112
NA,the frills-an d we would get more feet,112
NA,drilled for the same money. We would,112
NA,pay less by way of subsidy for the total,112
NA,footage produced. I know that the other,112
NA,department has the final say on all subwe,112
NA,"missions, and that its experience in this",112
NA,prevents too much padding of the particularly,112
NA,"accounts, but it seems that this basis would",112
NA,give us the most for our money. The feasible.,112
NA,experience of the department would enable,112
NA,it to formulate an appropriate footage,112
NA,"basis. For those reasons, I hope",112
NA,eventually this method will be the sole,112
NA,"method of subsidy, not just an alternative",112
NA,method as at present.,112
NA,We do not have unlimited money to,112
NA,"spend, and it is essential that we get full",112
NA,value for every £1 spent. It is also essen-,112
NA,tial that everybody taking part in the drive,112
NA,for oil should have equal access to the funds,112
NA,"available, and that the big-time operators",112
NA,should not hog the whole of the available,112
NA,profunds and squeeze out the smaller opera-,112
NA,tors because the big boys have used up all,112
NA,the funds available. For this reason I,112
NA,would like to suggest that a limit be placed,112
NA,on the total subsidy that may be allotted,112
NA,"to for any one hole, and I suggest that",112
NA,"of £150,000 would be a suitable figure.",112
NA,Here in Australia we have a tendency,112
NA,to start a hole and just keep on drilling,112
NA,cases until we come to bedrock. There is no,112
NA,question about that. In looking at the statis-,112
NA,tics of exploration I note that a least 80,112
NA,"per cent, of the free world's oil comes from",112
NA,"wells not exceeding 7,000 feet in depth,",112
NA,"and 60 per cent, of it comes from wells",112
NA,"of under 5,000 feet deep. The cost of",112
NA,starts at less than £10 a foot. At a,112
NA,"depth of 7,000 feet it increases to about",112
NA,"£16 a foot. At 10,000 feet the cost gets up",112
NA,"between £24 and £28 a foot, and below",112
NA,that depth it increases so steeply that drilling,112
NA,could be regarded as impracticable. Limit-,112
NA,"ing the total subsidy to £150,000 for any",112
NA,one hole means that any company wishing,112
NA,to go ahead on an unpromising well will,112
NA,have to make a careful decision on the,112
NA,available and decide whether it,112
NA,will be worth while to carry on.,112
NA,"In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, I",112
NA,commend the bill to honorable members.,112
NA,"Having in mind the size of Australia, this",112
NA,Government is making a greater contribu-,112
NA,tion to oil search than the government of any,112
NA,country in the free world. I think,112
NA,must concentrate on those areas where,112
NA,"work the indications have been most promising,",112
NA,areas that are close enough to,112
NA,industry and capital cities to be commercially,112
NA,"The only other thing we need, for",112
NA,"which we cannot make legislative provision,",112

Mr BRYANT ,Wills) [12.34 a.m.] -,114
NA,Before consideration of this bill was,114
NA,interrupted by another example of the,114
NA,Government's policy of paying subsidies,114
NA,"to its friends out of the public purse,",114
NA,Opposition was endeavouring to show how,114
NA,unjustified is the Government's use of,114
NA,people's money to subsidize a private airline.,114
NA,So far no justification for this policy,114
NA,come from the other side of the chamber.,114
NA,"Nor has there been any denial of the ownership,",114
NA,Opposition's statement that this agreement,114
NA,is calculated to give an unfair advantage,114
NA,over the public airline to a private,114
NA,competitor.,114
NA,"Interestingly enough, the main comment 53,000 people?",114
NA,that one hears from the other side of the,114
NA,chamber is that the Labour Government,114
NA,favoured one of the two airlines. Whose,114
NA,airline is Trans-Australia Airlines? What,114
NA,kind of responsibility must the Parliament,114
NA,and the Government of Australia accept to,114
NA,"a private concern, such as Australian",114
NA,National Airways Proprietary Limited,114
NA,"Ansett-A.N.A., no matter how important",114
NA,is? There seems to be a suggestion that,114
NA,T.A.A. does not belong to the people of,114
NA,Australia and that it is not a creation of,114
NA,"this Parliament. Of course, that is where",114
NA,we on this side of the committee strongly,114
NA,disagree with the Government.,114
NA,"We ask the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt),",114
NA,the Prime Minister ( Mr Menzies) himself,114
NA,and all the members of the Cabinet this,114
NA,question: If T.A.A. were your,114
NA,"concern, would you treat it in this way?",114
NA,Would you do any of these things? Would,114
NA,you tie up your concern for sixteen years,114
NA,so that it could not compete effectively,114
NA,with its logical competitors? If T.A.A.,114
NA,"were your own concern, or if you were",114
NA,handling its affairs in the same way as you,114
NA,"would handle your own, would you hand",114
NA,over its aircraft to make up a deficiency,114
NA,that had been incurred by a private enter-,114
NA,prise under a -bad buying programme? If,114
NA,"T.A.A. were your own concern, or if you",114
NA,were handling the affairs of the nation in,114
NA,the same way as one would expect you,114
NA,"to handle your own private affairs, would",114
NA,you shackle this airline so that it could not,114
NA,develop its services free from hindrance?,114
NA,""" to Would you demand a set profit? Of all",114
NA,"things, would you share your own business?",114
NA,Of course you would not. In what way,114
NA,can you justify that kind of altitude?,114
NA,We on this side of the chamber say that,114
NA,this is simply a case in which the Govern-,114
NA,"ment is placing the advantage of the 53,000",114
NA,the shareholders of Ansett-A.N.A. before the,114
NA,"advantage of the 10,000,000 citizens of",114
NA,the Australia who are the shareholders of,114
NA,T.A.A. How can you possibly justify such,114

NA,matters from the point of view of private,114
NA,is it not a fact that T.A.A. has,114
NA,"10,000,000 Australian shareholders and",114
NA,"Ansett-A.N.A. has 53,000 private share-",114
NA,holders? How can you possibly justify,114
NA,"sacrificing the interests of those 10,000,000",114
NA,people for the particular interests of the,114
NA,If you want to adopt the mystique of,114
NA,"private enterprise, what is wrong with",114
NA,T.A.A. itself applying the same techniques,114
NA,as Mr Ansett himself has adopted so suc-,114
NA,cessfully in relation to smaller airlines?,114
NA,If it was good enough for Mr Ansett's con-,114
NA,or cern to swallow Butler Air Transport,114
NA,it Limited and to take over Australian,114
NA,"National Airways Proprietary Limited,",114
NA,surely the same applies to the public enter-,114
NA,prise. But that is not the particular point,114
NA,"at issue. The point at issue, and the one",114
NA,to which the people of Australia will take,114
NA,strong exception at the forthcoming elec-,114
NA,"tions if it is put clearly before them, is",114
NA,that this Government is using the resources,114
NA,of the nation and its parliamentary powers,114

NA,own private nation's own interests.,114
Mr JESS ,La Trobe) [12.40 a.m.] -,114
NA,"Mr Chairman, we on this side of the",114
NA,committee realize that a certain facade,114
NA,"has been put up by Opposition members,",114
NA,who are endeavouring to take up the,115
NA,committee's time by talking on every,115
NA,clause. They are thereby making a com-,115
NA,plete farce of the consideration of this,115
NA,"bill. Therefore, we also have decided to",115
NA,discuss every clause. This clause pro-,115
NA,vides for the repeal of the title of the,115
NA,principal act and the insertion of the,115
NA,following title:-,115
NA,An Act to approve certain Agreements relating,115
NA,"to Air Transport, and for purposes connected",115
NA,therewith.,115
NA,The honorable member for East Sydney,115
NA,( Mr Ward) has proposed a completely,115
NA,"farcical amendment, the terms of which",115
NA,will give the people of Australia some,115
NA,indication of what they could expect if,115
NA,ever a change of government were to,115
NA,occur. If the Opposition wishes to discuss,115
NA,"this clause, we are prepared to discuss",115
NA,it fully with them.,115
NA,The purpose of this bill is to give effect 1962.,115
NA,to and obtain parliamentary approval for,115
NA,"an agreement between the Commonwealth,",115
NA,the Australian National Airlines,115
NA,"mission, Ansett Transport Industries",115
NA,ited and Australian National Airways Prois,115
NA,prietary Limited. The agreement has,115
NA,"been executed by all the parties, including order.",115
NA,"the commission, but does not come into",115
NA,force until it is approved by Parliament.,115
NA,I say frankly that I consider that honorruled,115
NA,able gentlemen opposite are making a,115
NA,complete farce of to-night's proceedings.,115
NA,In addition to obtaining approval for the,115
NA,"airlines agreement, the bill contains",115
NA,substantive provisions which are necespoint,115
NA,sary in order to give effect to the agreebers,115
NA,"ment. First, the Commonwealth",115
NA,authorized to give the guarantees provided opposite,115
NA,"for in the agreement; secondly, the Aus-",115
NA,tralian National Airlines Commission is,115
NA,given necessary statutory authority to,115
NA,able it to carry out the agreement; and,115
NA,"finally, the Minister is required",115
NA,tinue to perform his existing functions,115
NA,under the Airlines Equipment Act 1958,115
NA,relating to the control of aircraft,115
NA,and acquisition of new aircraft for so long,115
NA,as the airlines agreements remain in force.,115
NA,Mr Reynolds -O n a point of order!,115
NA,Is this committee to be asked to endure,115
NA,the reading of this sort of speech ad,115
NA,nauseam?,115
The CHAIRMAN , Mr Lucock) -,115
NA,There is no substance in the point of order.,115
Mr JESS ,Unlik e Opposition mem-,115
NA,"bers, who have put on a completely",115
NA,"hypocritical act this evening, I am at least",115
NA,discussing the clause. I am not going,115
NA,through an act purely because this is the,115
NA,final night of the last sittings of the Par-,115
NA,liament. As long as I have the right to,115
NA,"discuss the clauses of this bill, the gentle-",115
NA,men on the other side of the chamber,115
NA,will stay here and discuss the bill clause,115
NA,by clause. We on this side are prepared,115
NA,to sit them out.,115
NA,The Civil Aviation Agreement of 1952,115
NA,as supplemented more recently by the,115
NA,Airlines Equipment Act 1958 has been the,115
NA,corner-stone of the Government's success-,115
NA,"ful two-airline policy. However, the",115
NA,financial provisions of that agreement will,115
NA,"become inoperative on 18th November,",115
NA,"Mr Reynolds - Mr Chairman, I again",115
NA,Comtake a point of order. The honorable,115
NA,Limmember has not lifted his head once. He,115
NA,"reading his speech in its entirety, and",115
NA,I again ask you to rule that he is out of,115
The CHAIRMAN ," I rule again, as I",115
NA,"previously, that there is no substance",115
NA,in the point of order raised by the honor-,115
NA,able member for Barton.,115
Mr JESS , I do not intend to delay the,115
NA,"three committee very long, Mr Chairman. The",115
NA,that I and various honorable mem-,115
NA,on this side of the chamber wish to,115
NA,is make is that if honorable members,115
NA,"Mr Daly -O n a point of order, Mr.",115
NA,enChairman: I direct your attention to Stand-,115
NA,ing Order No. 61 which provides that an,115
NA,to conhonorable member may not read his,115
NA,speech. If the honorable member for La,115
NA,"Trobe wishes to read his speech, should he",115
NA,capacity not tell us who wrote it for him?,115
The CHAIRMAN ,Ther e is no sub-,115
NA,stance in the point of order raised by the,115
NA,honorable member for Grayndler. How-,115
NA,"ever, I ask the honorable member for La",115
NA,Trobe to come back to the clause that is,115
NA,before the committee.,115
Mr JESS ," I bow to your ruling, Mr.",116
NA,Chairman. I think it is perfectly correct.,116
NA,"However, we are discussing a clause which",116
NA,provides for a new title for the principal,116
NA,act. The Opposition seeks to have that,116
NA,proposed new title amended. Surely we,116
NA,are permitted to talk about matters encom-,116
NA,passed in the title of the principal act.,116
NA,Honorable members opposite wish to,116
NA,know what I am reading. It is a speech,116
NA,made by the Minister for Civil Aviation,116
NA,(Senator Paltridge). Surely nothing is,116
NA,more relevant to this discussion than are,116
NA,the remarks made by the Minister on these,116
NA,matters.,116
NA,"Mr Cairns - I take a point of order,",116
NA,"Mr Chairman. Obviously, the honorable",116
NA,member for La Trobe misunderstood the,116
NA,point of order that was taken earlier. It,116
NA,"was directed, not at his reading from the",116
NA,speech made by the Minister for Civil,116
NA,"Aviation, but solely at his delivering a",116
NA,"read speech, a procedure which is con-",116
NA,"trary to the Standing Orders. I submit,",116
NA,"therefore, that the honorable member is",116
NA,out of order in delivering a read speech.,116
The CHAIRMAN ,"Again , there is no",116
NA,substance in the point of order raised.,116
Mr JESS , I think that honorable,116
NA,members on the other side of the chamber,116
NA,have at last got the point: If they wish,116
NA,"to talk this measure out clause by clause,",116
NA,we shall match them. I suggest that the,116
NA,points made by the Minister are relevant to,116
NA,the discussion of this clause. At this,116
NA,"stage, I think it is necessary for me to",116
NA,say only that we on this side of the com-,116
NA,mittee support the clause as it is and regard,116
NA,the amendment as being completely farcical.,116
NA,We are now quite prepared to proceed to,116
NA,consider the next clause and to see what,116
NA,happens when it is before the committee.,116

The CHAIRMAN ,Yes .,117
NA,Mr Allan Fraser - This present,117
NA,"amendment, Mr Chairman, relates solely",117
NA,"to the agreement, and accepts approval of",117
NA,the agreement. It is quite a different,117
NA,matter from the earlier amendment. It,117

NA,approved and shall come into operation,117
NA,as from a date six months after the first,117
NA,meeting of the Twenty-fourth Par-,117

NA,"of the Twenty-fourth Parliament"". The",117
NA,present amendment refers to an entirely,117

Mr WARD ,East Sydney) [1.0 a.m.] -,118
NA,I wish to seek some clarification of one,118
NA,of the proposals in clause 5. Proposed,118
NA,new section 5 states-,118
NA,The Australian National Airlines Commission-,118
NA,(a) shall be taken to have had power to,118
NA,enter into the agreement referred to,118
NA,in sub-section (2.) of section three of,118
NA,this Act;,118
NA,I have never in my experience in this,118
NA,Parliament seen such peculiar wording. I,118
NA,wonder why it has been used in this case.,118
NA,The provision states that the Australian,118
NA,"National Airlines Commission "" shall be",118
NA,"taken to have had power "". Is there some",118
NA,serious doubt whether the commission had,118
NA,power to enter into such an agreement? It,118
NA,would appear to me that merely putting the,118
NA,provision in this form will not completely,118
NA,resolve the question whether the power,118
NA,existed. There are certain sections of this,118
NA,"agreement which, from my point of view",118
NA,as a layman- I do not claim to have legal,118
NA,experience-woul d be suspect if challenged,118
NA,as not coming within the constitutional,118
NA,"powers of this Parliament. Therefore, I",118
NA,am curious to know why that phraseology,118
NA,was used and whether it means that there,118
NA,is in the minds of the legal advisers of the,118
NA,Government some serious doubt that the,118
NA,Australian National Airlines Commission,118
NA,has the necessary power to enter into tbe,118
NA,agreement included in the bill.,118

NA,beyond the matter before the committee.,118
NA,I uphold the point of order raised by the,118
NA,honorable member for Chisholm ( Sir Wilfrid,118
NA,Kent Hughes).,118
Mr CAIRNS ,"Ver y well, Sir. I shall",118
NA,proceed to speak on the clause without,118
NA,moving the amendment. I wish to speak,118
NA,particularly in relation to that part which,118
NA,refers to the functions of the Minister for,118
NA,Civil Aviation. I submit that in the cir-,118
NA,cumstances the Minister should not be per-,118
NA,mitted to continue to perform his func-,118
NA,tions,118
NA,Mr MCMahon - I rise to order. Clause,118
NA,"5 refers, among other things, to the Minis-",118
NA,ter's functions under Part IV. of the Air-,118
NA,lines Equipment Act 1958. I submit that,118
NA,the honorable member must relate his,118
NA,remarks to those of the Minister's functions.,118
The CHAIRMAN ,Th e Minister for,119
NA,Labour and National Service is correct.,119
NA,Possibly we have not heard sufficient from,119
NA,the honorable member for Yarra to be,119
NA,able to determine whether he is keeping,119
NA,to the matters dealt with in the clause,119
NA,before the committee.,119
NA,"Mr MCMahon -Ma y I ask, Sir, that",119
NA,you listen to the honorable gentleman and,119
NA,if he intends to enter into the general,119
NA,debate on the question that he raised pre-,119
NA,viously relating to a senator in another,119
NA,"place, that you rule him out of order if",119
NA,he becomes irrelevant? I think that at this,119
NA,late hour of the night be should keep,119
NA,strictly to the subject-matter of clause 5,119
NA,of the bill.,119
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! I remind,119
NA,the Minister that I have listened to the,119
NA,speeches that have been made by honorable,119
NA,"members and when they have transgressed,",119
NA,the Chair has so ruled.,119
Mr CAIRNS ," Mr Chairman, I thank",119
NA,you for your ruling. I suggest to the,119
NA,Minister that the hour of the night has,119
NA,nothing to do with the way the Standing,119
NA,Orders should be interpreted.,119
NA,I submit for the consideration of,119
NA,committee that the Minister for Civil,119
NA,Aviation cannot in any way be held to,119
NA,carrying out his functions properly. I make,119
NA,no reference to anything that has been,119
NA,alleged against the Minister up to,119
NA,"present. However, the Government from Sydney.",119
NA,time to time has said tbat it supports a,119
NA,two-airline policy. I have had the privilege,119
NA,of having banded to me this evening at a,119
NA,very late hour- I think that is significant-,119
NA,the report of the Australian National,119
NA,lines Commission. I want to refer to this,119
NA,report to show the committee that,119
NA,Minister is not properly carrying out his significance,119
NA,"functions, even in accordance with",119
NA,policy pronounced by the Government.,119
NA,"support this submisison, I want to read",119
NA,"extract from the report. At page six, the",119
NA,following statement appears:-,119
NA,"For the operation of passenger aircraft,",119
NA,Co-ordinator,119
NA,He has the power to determine matters,119
NA,issue between Trans-Australia Airlines,119
NA,Ansett-A.N.A -,119
NA,set a load factor of 68 per cent. As TransWhitlam),119
NA,Australia Airline's load factor was already,119
NA,that order while its competitor's was well below,119
NA,"that figure, the reduction in seat capacity which",119
NA,followed this decision,119
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The honor-,119
NA,able member's time has expired.,119
Mr WARD ,East Sydney) [1.12 a.m.] -,119
NA,I desire to take up the debate at the point,119
NA,reached by tbe honorable member for,119
NA,Yarra ( Mr Cairns) and to quote from this,119
NA,T.A.A. report that we have now received at,119
NA,"a very late hour. Before I proceed, I shall",119
NA,comment on one very significant event in,119
NA,this debate. The people will be interested,119
NA,to know that the debate on this bill was,119
NA,suddenly interrupted and deferred until a,119
NA,very late hour when the proceedings were,119
NA,no longer being broadcast. There was,119
NA,no reason advanced for the interruption of,119
NA,"the debate at that time, and what might",119
NA,be regarded as somewhat less contentious,119
NA,legislation was debated to take up time.,119
NA,Mr Townley - I rise to order. I think,119
NA,this is completely irrelevant to clause 5.,119
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! At the,119
NA,moment we are considering clause 5 which,119
NA,refers to sections 4 and 5 of the principal,119
NA,act and which raises certain matters.,119
NA,Mr Townley -Th e power to enter into,119
NA,the an agreement is the matter raised.,119
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The matter,119
NA,be referred to by the honorable member for,119
NA,East Sydney has some relation to the clause,119
NA,"now being considered by the committee, and",119
NA,the I call the honorable member for East,119
Mr WARD ,"Than k you, Mr Chairman.",119
NA,I do not intend to proceed any further with,119
NA,this argument; I have made my protest about,119
NA,the tactics adopted by the Government in,119
NA,Airinterrupting the debate on this bill. I,119
NA,support the view expressed by the honorable,119
NA,the member for Yarra. There is some,119
NA,"in the fact that, after this debate",119
NA,the had proceeded for some time we were,119
NA,To suddenly presented with the 16th annual,119
NA,an report of the Australian National Airlines,119
NA,Commission. This information should have,119
NA,been in the hands of honorable members,119
NA,the before the debate commenced so that they,119
NA,could have considered it. I think this is,119
NA,at some sort of an act intended to handicap,119
NA,and the Opposition. I am reminded by the,119
NA,Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr.,119
NA,that the letter conveying the,119
NA,"of report to Senator Paltridge, the Minister",119
NA,"for Civil Aviation, -and signed by Sir Giles",120
NA,"Chippindall, ""the chairman of the com-",120
NA,"mission, is dated 12th October, .1961.",120
NA,Mr Townley. -Yo u .know the report is,120
NA,not .received on .the same day as .the letter is,120
NA,dated.,120
Mr WARD ,I t would appear that this,120
NA,report :has already -been in .the -hands,120
NA,the Government for a fortnight; yet it was,120
NA,circulated to honorable members .only,120
NA,toaiight. J shall proceed with the quotation,120
NA,.from the report because as the .honorable,120
NA,".member -for Yarra said, there is undoubted",120
NA,evidence that the Minister :is aiot performing,120
NA,.his proper functions in .the operation of,120
NA,what he calls the two-iairline system. The,120
NA,passage on page 6 of the .report jeads-,120
NA,"Tor -the operation o'f passenger -aircraft,",120
NA,Co-ordinator set a load factor of 68%. As,120
NA,T.A.A.'s load factor was .already of .that,120
NA,while its competitor's was well below that,120
NA,ithe reduction in seat capacity which followed,120
NA,"decision ;caused a "" spillover'"" of traffic",120
NA,T.A.A. to its competitor.,120
NA,The operation of freighter aircraft is also,120
NA,"covered under 'the Agreement, and initially each",120
NA,'operator was permitted to -provide not more,120
NA,half the capacity required to uplift the,120
NA,freight available at a load factor on freighter,120
NA,craft of -68 per cent. At a subsequent re-hearing,120
NA,"of this matter, a .new decision",120
NA,"Co-ordinator setting a load factor of 70 per cent.,",120
NA,but which allowed -Ansett-A.'N.A. to provide 60,120
NA,"tper .cent, of the .capacity and T.A.A. the",120
NA,"ing -40 per .cent, of 'the .capacity.",120
NA,.1 suggest that that shows deliberate,120
NA,-ment ipatronage of the iprivate airline.,120
NA,T.A.A. has the greater attraction jfor .the,120
NA,public and if allowed to operate in active,120
NA,-competition would .undoubtedly .attract,120
NA,.much .greater proportion of the .travelling,120
NA,.public than the private airline would. On,120
NA,"the .question of freight, the rationalization",120
NA,"committee, which is supposed to .equalize",120
NA,"the .opportunities of the two airlines, .decided",120
NA,"that 60 per .cent, should .go .to .the private",120
NA,"airline .and 40 per .cent, to the Government",120
NA,airline. How .can i t be said that either,120
NA,Government .or -the Minister is carrying out -thing.,120
NA,.the policy that.has been declared? When the,120
NA,Government declares that it .supports a,120
NA,"airJine policy, naturally it is .assumed .that",120
NA,both airlines will be .given .equal opportunidiscussed,120
NA,ties not only in the carriage of passengers,120
NA,but also in .the carriage .of freight,120
NA,It is admitted in the .report that,120
NA,has a greater attraction for ithe public,120
NA,Ansett-A.N.A. has. T.he report,120
NA,.quite frankly that there is a.spillover of busi-,120
NA,ness irom T.A.A. to the private airline. I,120
NA,am given to .understand that .there is ;a direct,120
NA,telephone line between the air terminals,120
NA,operated by IE.A.A. and Ansett-A.N.A.,120
NA,When rpeople cannot be accommodated by,120
NA,T.A.A. or no suitable .flight is available for,120
NA,"them, the booking office .transfers the busi-",120
NA,of ness to Ansett-A.N.A. We .consider that,120
NA,that is no competition .at all. Jf the Govern-,120
NA,"ment airline were given ,proper opportunity,",120
NA,"as it should be, .to carry on .a competitive",120
NA,"service, there would be no doubt as to the",120
NA,outcome and .there would be no doubt as .to,120
NA,which .airline would .prove to be more suc-,120
NA,cessful in securing the support of the public.,120
NA,For the Government to say 'continually,120
NA,that this agreement was .entered into by,120
NA,the both airlines freely 'is quite wrong. As I,120
NA,"order said earlier, '.it was a shotgun marriage.",120
NA,"figure, What chance has the Australian. National",120
NA,"this Airlines Commission, which is a Govern-",120
NA,".from ment body, to disobey or disregard a direc-",120
NA,tion from Ibe Government. I t '.had to do as,120
NA,it was told. But if T.A.A. was allowed to,120
NA,than make its own decisions-n t it was an .inde-,120
NA,total pendent authority- I am certain that .this,120
NA,airagreement would never have been regarded,120
NA,was given by the as satisfactory.,120

NA,Mr Cairns -W e have quoted 'from ithe,120

Mr CHANEY ,I f the report is to be,120

NA,:it. 'Rationalization of airline operations is,120
NA,at page 6. I invite honorable,120
NA,imembers to work out why there has been,120
NA,.rationalization and then l o draw their own,120
NA,T -A.A. conclusions. The honorable member for,120
NA,.thirn Yarra and the honorable member for East,120
NA,admits Sydney referred to the third last paragraph,120
NA,"on page. 6 of the report. That, paragraph",121
NA,reads:-,121
NA,For the operation' ofpassenger aircraft the=,121
NA,Co-ordinator set aload factor of 68%.,121
NA,What the honorable members say in effect,121
NA,is that to-morrow morning whena Viscount,121
NA,is. about to leaveCanberra for Melbourne,121
NA,l . A . A . will say that it has 100 passengers,121
NA,wishing totravel on that aircraft. Because,121
NA,"there are only. 68: seats on the aircraft, 32.",121
NA,"of: those 100 passengers: will have to travel,",121

NA,Yet they rise in their places in. this chamber,121
NA,"at 1.20 a.m. on the last day o t Parliament,",121
NA,"and take matters, out of their context. They",121
NA,expect us on this side o f the chamber to,121
NA,sit back and say nothing while they are,121
NA,so dreadfully wrong.,121
Mr CAIRNS ,Yarra) [1.24 a.m.] - I do,121
NA,not want to take anything out of context in,121
NA,this debate. Far be it from me to confine,121
NA,discussion to any particular section of the,121
NA,report of' the Australian National Airlines,121
NA,Commission-. E would like to refer the,121
NA,honorable member for Perth ( Mr Chaney);,121
NA,who admits that he. isnot an expert but,121
NA,"only a reader, to page 7 of the report.",121
NA,Reference has been made to the competing,121
NA,section of airline operations in this country.,121
NA,We learn fromthereport thatasa result,121
NA,"of certain changes , recently agreed to-",121
NA,"in terrasofi revenue ton mites, on competitive",121
NA,"routes, T.A.A. uplifted some 49 per cent, and",121
NA,the competing group some 51 per ceni. of the,121
NA,available traffic.,121
NA,The competing group has been put in a,121
NA,position of predominance as. a result of,121
NA,recent decisions.,121
NA,Dealing with non-competitive operations,121
NA,the report states-,121
NA,"In the non-competitive area of operation, the",121
NA,Commission operates a network in Queensland,121
NA,and the Northern Territory as well as through,121
NA,services to Darwin. The Commission is. unable,121
NA,to expand its non-competitive operations to any,121
NA,"degree because of itslack of intra-State rights,,",121
NA,which inhibits its. operation in all States except-,121
NA,"Queensland and Tasmania. Its competitor, on",121
NA,"the other hand-, suffers from no such disability,",121
NA,and through a group of subsidiary airline com-,121
NA,"panies has developed a non-competitive, network",121
NA,"which is already twice the size of that, operated-",121
NA,by T.A.A. T.A.A.'smain offset against; the great,121
NA,advantage held by its competitor on nonrcom-,121
NA,petitive routes has been its operations? on the,121
NA,routes which link Darwin with Alice Springs and',121
NA,Mount Isa. The entrance of Ansett-A.N.A. to.,121
NA,"those routes by the division of the. current, fro",121
NA,"quencies: equally, between both operators has, of",121
NA,"course,, made the disparity even more pronounced.",121
NA,T.A.A's traffic over non-competitive routes will,121
NA,now total only about one-sixth of that carried,121
NA,by its competitor.,121
NA,Thatis the two-airlinespolicy with equal,121
NA,opportunities for both airlines! O n non-,121
NA,competitive routes T.A.A. will have one-,121
NA,sixth of the' traffic and its competitor will,121
NA,have five-sixths. Is that the equality for,121
NA,which honorable members opposite stand?,121
NA,I havesuspected this to be the case for the,121
NA,six years that I have been Here-. The,121
NA,peoplewith all the money areto get five-,121
NA,sixths of the business and the peoplewith-,121
NA,out the money will get the remaining,121
NA,one-sixth. There it is in black and white-,121
NA,in the report which continues-,121
NA,This operational imbalance must have a marked,121
NA,elTect on T.A.A.'s financial situation.,121

NA,stated in the report are clear. I submit,121
NA,"that no onecan. have, confidencein. this",121
NA,"Government's, administration of our inr",121
NA,ternal airlines. Obviously the Government,121
NA,is on the side of private enterprise. Ob-,121
NA,"viously it is on the side of Ansett-A.N.A.,",121
NA,which no doubt pays substantial amounts,121
NA,to the election funds of the Government,121

NA,the performances of the Government to,121
NA,"thelegislation tbat it brings into, this",121
NA,place. I f the honorable member for Perth-,121
NA,1,121
NA,is able to readand draw the: ordinary con-,121
NA,clusionsthat a man. with common sense.,121
NA,"would draw, he will draw the conclusion",122
NA,that this Government is endeavouring,122
NA,strangle T.A.A. in the interests of a prifor,122
NA,vate monopoly.,122
Mr CHANEY ,Perth) [1.27 a.m.] -,122
NA,have no desire to convince the honorable,122
NA,member for Yarra that I am a man of some,122
NA,common sense or that I can read. I am,122
NA,pleased that he read from page 7 of the,122
NA,report. I think that even he will realize,122
NA,that in civil aviation in Australia to-day,122
NA,the question of profit-making does not airlines,122
NA,arise in relation to non-competitive routes,122
NA,"such as Channel country routes, country",122
NA,routes in Western Australia or South,122
NA,"tralia, or even the routes covered by Eastother",122
NA,West Airlines. The profitable air routes,122
NA,are on the east coast. I am very,122
NA,scious of this because I live in Western,122
NA,Australia where we suffer certain disapeting,122
NA,bilities because of the utilization of,122
NA,craft of the major paying routes. If you,122
NA,study this report on page 7 you will see,122
NA,the same message there. What has been discrimination,122
NA,"the result? The result has been, year",122
NA,"after year, increased profits, increased",122
NA,"mileage, increased passenger loadings and",122
NA,so on. The truth is that the matter raised,122
NA,by the honorable member for Yarra,122
NA,worth raising. All I have is the capacity,122
NA,to read and to absorb. I do not want to,122
NA,argue any further. My sole object is to,122
NA,stop honorable members opposite from,122
NA,continually making statements that are not,122
NA,founded on fact.,122
NA,Clause agreed to.,122
NA,Clause 6 agreed to.,122
NA,Clause 7 (Second Schedule).,122
Mr WARD ,East Sydney [1.30 a.m.] -,122
NA,This schedule contains the whole of the,122
NA,"agreement. I do not propose to traverse Anderson, C. G. W.",122
NA,"all the arguments that have been adduced Anthony,",122
NA,"in criticism of the agreement, but I do Barnes, C. £.",122
NA,"refer the committee to that part of the Barwick,",122
NA,schedule which reads-,122
NA,And whereas one of the objects of the parties,122
NA,to this agreement is to secure and maintain a,122
NA,"position in which there are two, and not more",122
NA,"than two, operators of trunk route airline services, Cleaver, R.",122
NA,one being the Commission each capable of effec-,122
NA,"tive competition with the other, and the parties",122
NA,intend tbat this agreement shall be construed,122
NA,having regard to that object.,122
NA,I have heard it argued that there is some,122
NA,doubt whether this provision would stand,122
NA,if the constitutional power of the Govern-,122
NA,"ment, or the Australian National Airlines",122
NA,Commission to implement it were chal-,122
NA,to lenged. Although the agreement provides,122
NA,"two airlines, it does in a sense create",122
NA,a monopoly of the business for two particu-,122
NA,I lar airlines. What will be the position,122
NA,under section 92 of the Constitution if,122
NA,other interest in the country is able,122
NA,to provide aircraft and decides to run an,122
NA,inter-state service? Would it be run off,122
NA,"the course, as the saying goes, by the other",122
NA,acting in active competition against,122
NA,it? Would the third competitor in the,122
NA,interstate services get the same measure of,122
NA,Ausassistance from the Government as the,122
NA,two operators enjoy at the present,122
NA,time? Would the airmails be divided three,122
NA,conways? Would Government business be,122
NA,divided equally between the three com-,122
NA,"airlines? If it were not, what would",122
NA,airbe the position under section 92 of the,122
NA,Constitution? If another airline did com-,122
NA,"mence, how would the Government justify",122
NA,against it? I should like some,122

NA,Debate resumed from 17th October the committee stage.,123
NA,"(vide page 2107), on motion by Mr.",123
NA,Townley-,123
NA,That the b i ll be now read a second time.,123
Mr ALLAN FRASER ,Eden-Monaro) The,123
NA,[1.30 a.m.]-Thi s bill seeks to confer upon silent.,123
NA,the Minister power to dictate to the,123
NA,Australian National Airlines Commission,123
NA,the percentage of profit which it must make,123
NA,and to make a whole series of stipulations.,123
NA,It seeks to provide general conditions stage.,123
NA,which the public of Australia associate,123
NA,with a deliberate attempt to cripple the,123
NA,operations of the publicly-owned airline,123
NA,favour of the privately-owned airlines,123
NA,this country. Whether or not the public,123
NA,"correct in holding that opinion, the fact",123
NA,remains that it is a very widespread public,123
NA,opinion. The Attorney-General ( Sir of this measure.,123
NA,Garfield Barwick) in particular will be,123
NA,aware of the importance of maintaining,123
NA,respect for the parliamentary institution.,123
NA,NOES. Mr Harold Holt- I rise to a point of,123
NA,"Halyen, L. C.",123
NA,"James, A. W.",123
NA,"order. It is my understanding, Mr.",123
NA,"Speaker, that by agreement between the",123
NA,representative of the Opposition and,123
Mr ALLAN FRASER , I do not know,123
NA,of any agreement.,123
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,A s I understand the,123
NA,"Tellers: situation, the House agreed that the three",123
NA,"Duthie, G. W. A .",123
NA,aviation bills should be considered together,123
NA,but voted on separately. We have now,123
NA,PAIRS. reached the stage where the vote on the,123
NA,motion for the second reading of this bill,123
NA,should be taken.,123
Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. John MCLeay) -,123
NA,Order! The Treasurer is correct. The,123
NA,"Kearney, V . D . House authorized the Airlines Agreements",123
NA,"Bird, A . C.",123
NA,Bill and the Australian National Airlines,123
NA,Bill to be debated together and voted on,123
NA,separately.,123
NA,Question resolved in the affirmative.,123
NA,Bill read a second time.,123
NA,In committee:,123
NA,Clauses 1 to 3 agreed to.,123
NA,Clause 4 (Financial policy of com-,123
NA,mission).,123
Mr ALLAN FRASER ,Eden-Monaro),123
NA,[1.42 a.m.] -Thi s is the clause which gives,123
NA,the Minister °,123
NA,"BILL 1961. Mr Chaney - I rise to a point of order,",123
NA,Mr Chairman. Surely the ruling which was,123
NA,given at the second-reading stage applies to,123
NA,Mr Bryant -Nonsense !,123
NA,Mr Chaney - I did not ask you for a,123
NA,decision. I asked the Chairman.,123
The CHAIRMAN , Mr Lucock) -Order !,123
NA,honorable member for Wills will remain,123
NA,"Mr Chaney - I ask for your ruling, Mr.",123
NA,Chairman. Surely if it has been decided that,123
NA,the clause shall be put to a vote an amend-,123
NA,ment cannot be moved at the committee,123
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! What hap-,123
NA,in pens in the House does not necessarily have,123
NA,of any relationship to what happens at the,123
NA,is committee stage. The decision of the House,123
NA,that two bills be considered together can-,123
NA,not bind the committee in its consideration,123
Mr ALLAN FRASER ,A s I was saying,123
NA,"when I was interrupted, this is the clause",123
NA,which empowers the Minister for Civil,123
NA,Aviation to fix the amount of profit that,124
NA,must be made by the publicily-owned air-,124
NA,line. Tbe various details and circumstances,124
NA,whicb are to be taken into: account clearly,124
NA,give the impression that the publicly-owned,124
NA,airline is to be crippled in order to confer,124
NA,an advantage upon the privately-owned air-,124
NA,line. This is causing very widespread dis-,124
NA,content amongst the Australian people.,124
NA,"This bill smells very high indeed. In fact,",124
NA,it ranks to high heaven. The cynical view,124
NA,of the man in the street-thi s impression has,124
NA,been created by the attitude of the Govern-,124
NA,ment in this matter-i s that this is a case,124
NA,"of plain graft. The Government, in failing",124
NA,to answer the charges that have been made,124
NA,"by the Opposition, has given weight to that",124
NA,cynical attitude which has been adopted by,124
NA,the man in the street.,124
NA,The proper recourse for this committee,124
NA,is to reject the clause. There is every evi-,124
NA,"dence that Mr Ansett, who is the con-",124
NA,"trolling force in the privately-owned airline,",124
NA,"is prepared to spend money and', to use cash",124
NA,as a means of obtaining support for the,124
NA,achievement of his objectives. This has been,124
NA,shown in the last two days by his action in,124
NA,"withdrawing advertising, and thereby with-",124
NA,"drawing revenue, from newspapers which",124
NA,dared to oppose the achievement of his,124
NA,"objectives. This, of course, gives rise to the",124
NA,public opinion that this Government is,124
NA,accepting instructions from Mr Ansett be-,124
NA,cause he is making very heavy contributions,124
NA,to Liberal Party funds for the approaching,124
NA,election.,124
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,D o you think any-,124
NA,body believes this rubbish?,124
Mr ALLAN FRASER ,Th e Treasurer,124
NA,says it is doubtful whether any one would,124
NA,believe this statement.,124
NA,"Mr Harold Holt-Thi s rubbish, I said.",124
Mr ALLAN FRASER ,Th e Govern-,124
NA,ment is the champion of free enterprise in,124
NA,tbis country and it relies on support from,124
NA,free enterprise. It relies not only on elec-,124
NA,toral support but also on financial support.,124
NA,The Government draws its party funds,124
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,You r leader said that,124
NA,"he would take £100,000 from the Chamber",124
NA,of Manufactures.,124
Mr ALLAN FRASER ,Yo u do not like,124
NA,this. The Government draws its party,124
NA,funds from the great private enterprise,124
NA,companies and institutions throughout,124
NA,Australia.,124
NA,Mr Browne - I bet you would not like,124
NA,to swap the Communist contribution for,124
NA,the Ansett contribution.,124
Mr ALLAN FRASER ,Th e honorable,124
NA,member mentions the Ansett contribution.,124
NA,This is the first acknowledgment from the,124
NA,Government that there is an Ansett con-,124
NA,tribution. There certainly is no Commu-,124
NA,nist contribution.,124
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! I suggest,124
NA,that the honorable member for Eden-,124
NA,Monaro should come back to the clause,124
NA,under discussion and not answer interjec-,124
NA,tions which have no relation to the clause.,124
Mr ALLAN FRASER , I obey your,124
NA,"ruling, Mr Chairman. I relate my remarks",124
NA,to the clause by stating that it appears to,124
NA,give such unfair advantages to the. private,124
NA,airline as to lend support to the impression,124
NA,that the private airlinecontrolled by Mr.,124
NA,Ansett is making a very large contribution,124
NA,to Liberal Party election funds. This is,124
NA,borne out by the fact that this Government,124
NA,relies for its party funds upon the contri-,124
NA,butions of private enterprise companies.,124
NA,"I read in an issue of the "" Nation"" pub-",124
NA,lished a week or so ago a statement to the,124
NA,effect that in the course of every year the,124
NA,"Liberal Party collected at least £200,000",124
NA,for the maintenance of its organization and,124
NA,"that it spends at least £250,000 upon the",124
NA,conduct of every election.,124
The CHAIRMAN ,Order !,124
Mr ALLAN FRASER , I am stating,124
NA,the reason why the clause should be re-,124
NA,jected.,124
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! I again ask,124
NA,the honorable member for Eden-Monaro to,124
NA,relate his remarks to the clause now before,124
NA,the committee. The subject of party funds,124
NA,has nothing to do with the matter referred,124
NA,to in the clause.,124
Mr ALLAN FRASER ,A m I entitled,124
NA,to say that the conditions imposed upon,124
NA,the publicly-owned airline by this clause,124
NA,are apparently related to improper,124
NA,methods,124
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The honor-,124
NA,able member has already mentioned the,124
NA,matter in relation to wbich he is now ask-,124
NA,ing for a ruling. I have already given a,124
NA,ruling. I suggest that the honorable mem-,124
NA,ber abide by it.,124
Mr ALLAN FRASER ,Loi s clause,125
NA,requires Trans-Australia Airlines to provide,125
NA,such percentage of profit on its capital,125
NA,is ordered by the Minister for Civil Aviatban,125
NA,tion. What reason on earth can there be,125
NA,"for the Government wishing to impose this,",125
NA,crippling obligation upon the publiclyfor,125
NA,owned airline? I am not allowed to menparty,125
NA,tion the motive which would spring at once,125
NA,to the mind of any member of the public,125
NA,who was wondering why this extraordinary,125
NA,legislation should be placed before this,125
NA,Parliament in the very last hour of its,125
NA,existence. It is legislation which,125
NA,"future parliaments, and this Parliament has",125
NA,no right whatever to impose obligations on such,125
NA,future parliaments. The provisions of this and,125
NA,clause are obviously designed to confer,125
NA,"advantage upon Ansett-A.N.A., the private",125
NA,"company controlled: by a gentleman who,",125
NA,"in the last two days, has withdrawn adverthe",125
NA,"tising from, and therefore used financial",125
NA,"pressure upon, those newspapers, which",125
NA,have dared to oppose the achievement of Labour legislation.,125
NA,his objectives.,125
NA,The Government has claimed that it has,125
NA,acted fairly as hetween the independent,125
NA,airline-th e private airline-an d the and,125
NA,publicly-owned airline. How canthis be,125
NA,"so, when everything which Mr Ansett has",125
NA,"asked - for is, by this legislation, ta be",125
NA,granted to him? What motive actuated this,125
NA,"Government in giving to Mr Ansett, who",125
NA,is in competition with Trans-Australia,125
NA,"Airlines, every single advantage for which",125
NA,Mr Ansett asked? Everything; set out in,125
NA,the letter that he circulated to members,125
NA,this Parliament is now written into the operations.,125
NA,legislation. I am not allowed to. state the,125
NA,reason.,125
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The honoralways,125
NA,able member's time has expired.,125
Mr JESS ,La Trobe) [1.52 a.m.] -Th,125
NA,"debate on this bill, which is going on into",125
NA,"the early hours of the morning, is being",125
NA,conducted in a farcical way by the Oppositothe,125
NA,tion. I am not sure whether it is parliaA.N.A.,125
NA,mentary to say that the honorable member,125
NA,for Eden-Monaro- ( Mr Allan Fraser) by,125
NA,"his speech, reminds me of either Uriah",125
NA,Heep or Scrooge. If he wants to get the,125
NA,truth of the matter in relation to the clause,125
NA,"that is before the committee, he should",125
NA,"refer to tbe 195-7 debate on this subject,",125
NA,"during, which. Dr. Evatt agreed tbat. the",125
NA,two-airline policy was economic. That,125
NA,"appears on page 2477 of "" Hansard"" of",125
NA,as that year. This legislation does no more,125
NA,reaffirm this policy and put the indus-,125
NA,try on a sounder footing. Hypocrisy has-,125
NA,been displayed by the honorable member,125
NA,Eden-Monaro. He complained about,125
NA,funds. I should think that he would,125
NA,be the last person who would ever dare to.,125
NA,raise the subject in this House. The clause,125
NA,merely spells out in detail a provision,125
NA,already contained in section 32 of the,125
NA,Australian National Airlines Commission,125
NA,"will bind Act 1945-1959, which reads-",125
NA,"The Commission shall prepare estimates, in",125
NA,"form, as the Minister directs, of its receipts",125
NA,expenditure for each financial year and shall,125
NA,an submit those estimates to the Minister.,125
NA,Trans-Austraha Airlines already submits,125
NA,"estimates. When tbis measure is passed,",125
NA,people will know what the Minister,125
NA,takes into account in setting a target. A,125
NA,similar provision appears in the original,125
Mr WARD ,East Sydney) [1.54 a.m.] -,125
NA,This is probably the most extraordinary,125
NA,interesting clause of the bill. I direct,125
NA,the committee's attention to the fact that,125
NA,"this is not, as the honorable member for",125
NA,"La Trobe ( Mr Jess) suggested, the same pro-",125
NA,"vision as. appears in earlier legislation, be-",125
NA,cause the Minister and the Treasurer will,125
NA,"now be required, to confer and the Minister",125
NA,will have to declare for Trans-Australia Air-,125
NA,lines a profit target. He will have to do,125
NA,of that at the commencement of each year's,125
NA,The Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) has said,125
NA,by way of. interjection that the airline has,125
NA,"been required, to make profit. For a",125
NA,"number of years now, the airline has been",125
NA,"e paying to the Treasury, an average return",125
NA,"of 5 per cent. Evidently, this Government",125
NA,"is not satisfied, with having 5 per cent, paid",125
NA,Treasury. Itrealizes tbat Ansett-,125
NA,"has a much higher; cost, structure,",125
NA,soit hasincreasedthe cost structure of,125
NA,T.A.A. to put. Ansett-A.N.A. ina. better,125
NA,position in relationto.T.A.A. Let the com-,125
NA,mitteenote the relevant mattersthat have,125
NA,tot be takeninto account by the Minister,125
NA,and the Treasurer in determining the profit,125
NA,"target. Among theseare the profits, in",125
NA,"relation tocapital employed-,, that have been",125
NA,and are expected to be made by privately-,126
NA,owned air transport undertakings in Aus-,126
NA,tralia. Why should the profit target of,126
NA,T.A.A. have any relationship whatever to,126
NA,the operations and financial position of,126
NA,private airline companies? It is made quite,126
NA,evident that the Government is going to tie,126
NA,T.A.A. so closely in regard to this provision,126
NA,as to make it impossible for that airline,126
NA,to do other than what has been suggested,126
NA,by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr.,126
NA,"Calwell). In order to reach the profit target,",126
NA,it will have to increase fares and freights,126
NA,"and reduce services. As a result, the travel-",126
NA,ling public will suffer.,126
NA,The Government is taking no risks.,126
NA,"When I say that, I mean that Mr Ansett",126
NA,"is taking no risks, because one can guarantee",126
NA,that Mr Ansett assisted in the framing of,126
NA,"this provision, as it is exacdy what he asked",126
NA,for in the letter that he circulated to all,126
NA,honorable members. But to make certain,126
NA,"and to avoid any mistake, the Minister will",126
NA,"have the right, after having fixed a profit",126
NA,target for T.A.A. at the commencement of,126
NA,"the year, to review it at any time. If he",126
NA,"discovers that, despite all the obstacles,",126
NA,T.A.A. is still succeeding in getting more,126
NA,of the business than the Government or,126
NA,"Ansett wishes, he can revise the target. It",126
NA,is a most outrageous proposal. Members of,126
NA,the Opposition should use this in their elec-,126
NA,tion propaganda so that the people will know,126
NA,what this Government is doing to the,126
NA,people's assets.,126
NA,I noticed in the debate that honorable,126
NA,members opposite frankly admitted-som e,126
NA,were much franker than others-tha t they,126
NA,were worried about the people who had in-,126
NA,vested their money in this activity. I do,126
NA,not know the exact number of people who,126
NA,benefit as a result of the private airline,126
NA,"services in this country, but I do know that",126
NA,the whole of the Australian community is,126
NA,directly interested in the success or otherwise,126
NA,of the airline services operated by the Com-,126
NA,"monwealth itself. Therefore, when there is",126
NA,talk of watching the interests of contributors,126
NA,"to the private undertaking, we must remem-",126
NA,ber that every taxpayer in Australia is a,126
NA,shareholder in the Government airline ser-,126
NA,"vice. If this service fails, the whole of the",126
NA,Australian community will suffer. But this,126
NA,Government is worried only about the inves-,126
NA,tors in the private airline service. I say,126
NA,quite definitely that this provision is com-,126
NA,pletely obnoxious to any reasonable Aus-,126
NA,tralian citizen and to any reasonable mem-,126
NA,ber of this Parliament I think that the,126
NA,Opposition is taking the right attitude in,126
NA,"deciding to reject it, if possible, in its",126

NA,Clause 5 (Insurance).,127
Mr ALLAN FRASER ,Eden-Monaro),127
NA,"[2.9 a.m.] -W e come now, Mr Chairman,",127
NA,to the most iniquitous clause in the whole,127
NA,of this iniquitous legislation. This is a,127
NA,clause by means of which the Government,127
NA,is deliberately and flagrantly legislating in,127
NA,the private interest and against tbe public,127
NA,"interest it is sworn to support, nor is any",127
NA,attempt made in this clause to disguise what,127
NA,"52 the Government is doing. Until now,",127
NA,28 Trans-Australia Airlines has carried its own,127
NA,"insurance, as does every Commonwealth",127
NA,"24 instrumentality. Now, the Government pro-",127
NA,poses to impose on T.A.A. obligations in,127
NA,"AYES. respect of insurance, without regard to",127
NA,what is an adequate measure of insurance,127
NA,"Haworth, W. C. to provide against risks. In fact, it",127
NA,"Howson, P.",127
NA,deliberately defines risks as being the extent,127
NA,"to which, in the case of privately-owned",127
NA,"Kent Hughes, Sir Wilfrid air transport undertakings, they are",127
NA,"Killen, D . J.",127
NA,customarily covered by insurance. This,127
NA,"Mackinnon, E. D .",127
NA,means that whatever advantage T.A.A. has,127
NA,"had in the past, because it has been able",127
NA,"Opperman, H . F .",127
NA,to carry out its insurance at a cheaper rate,127
NA,"Snedden, B. M .",127
NA,"than the privately owned company could,",127
NA,is now to be taken away from it. Not one,127
NA,reason is given by the Government for this.,127
NA,"Wheeler, R. C.",127
NA,"Wilson, K . C.",127
NA,Mr Townley -I t was done at the airline w,127

Mr ALLAN FRASER , I have now,127
NA,heard from the Minister the extraordinary,127
NA,NOES. statement that this was done at the request,127
NA,of Trans-Australia Airlines.,127
NA,"Mr Townley -Tha t is right, I mentioned",127
NA,it in my second-reading speech.,127
NA,"Pollard, R. T.",127
NA,"Reynolds, L . J.",127
Mr ALLAN FRASER ,Rea d it out.,127
NA,Mr Townley - I said-,127
NA,F r o m time to time the Government has,127
NA,authorised the commission to act as a self-insurer,127
NA,"Stewart, F. E.",127
NA,in respect of a wide range of risks. W i t h the,127
NA,introduction of Electra aircraft costing more than,127
NA,"PAIRS. £1,000,000 the commission concluded that it",127
NA,would not be prudent to act as a self-insurer in,127
NA,"respect of such risks unless the Commonwealth,",127
NA,"in effect, guaranteed the liquidity of its insurance",127
NA,provisions.,127
Mr ALLAN FRASER , I am not,127
NA,"Bird, A. C. quarrelling with that and the Minister can-",127
NA,"Thompson, A. V.",127
NA,not gain anything by that quotation. Let,127
NA,him explain this: Did T.A.A. ask that,127
NA,the risk should be denned as the risk in the,127
NA,case of a privately owned airline that is,127
NA,customarily covered by insurance? That,127
NA,is the charge against the Government.,127
NA,There is nothing reasonable in it. A,127
NA,privately-owned undertaking insures with a,127
NA,"company that makes a profit, out of. the",128
NA,"insurance-, because, that is the: reason, for",128
NA,its existence.. There is no obligationon,128
NA,T . AA . or on the Government to do more-,128
NA,than make the provision that is necessary,128
NA,for the effective insurance of T.A.A.'s,128
NA,property and equipment. Yet the Govern-,128
NA,"ment,, t o i a punpose. that can. only be to-",128
NA,ensuce tbat in no circumstances whatever,128
NA,"shall T.A.A. have, any advantage, over the.",128
NA,"privately-owned airline,, has deliberately",128
NA,"written in. the provision, that T.A.A.. must",128
NA,"insure, to. the extent that a private company",128
NA,must insurewith an insurance company,128
NA,"which makes, a profit out of the. transaction.",128
NA,"That, is: completely iniquitous, and. shows,",128
NA,no regard for the publicly-owned under-,128
NA,taking. It is designed to. ensure an advant-,128
NA,age lo the privately-owned operator... This,128
NA,"Ithink, does not come strangelyfrom, a-",128
NA,"Government, which, is the political repre-",128
NA,"sentative of. a. party which is financed, by.",128
NA,"big business, interests, in this, country,, and",128

Mr JESS ,La Trobe) [2.14 a.m.] - r,128

NA,"Sexton, i . C. L .",129
NA,House will now adjourn and will be dis-,129

NA,Thomoson -A. V. begin to engage in that extraordinary per-,129
NA,"Mclvor, H . J.",129
NA,formance which one calls a general election.,129
NA,My distinguished opponent and I will go all,129
NA,around Australia. We will expose to our,129
NA,listeners the wickedness of our opponents.,129
NA,"We will have, according to our taste and",129
NA,"fancy a good time or a bad time. But, Sir,",129
NA,there is something to be said at the end of,129
NA,"a session, and there is much more to be",129
NA,said at the end of a parliament.,129
NA,Second Heading. It is very interesting to recall that as a,129
NA,parliament ends we remind ourselves of,129
NA,from 17th some great things that we have in common.,129
NA,by I know that my friends on the Opposition,129
NA,are hoping to be over on this side of the,129
NA,chamber and that they hope that we will,129
NA,be over on the other side in due course.,129
NA,The electors will make tbe decision on,129
NA,"dethat matter. It is a wonderful thing, in",129
NA,"any country, that the electors sbould be",129
NA,able to do so. When one looks around the,129
NA,"world, one sees how many countries there",130
NA,are in which the people do not have a real,130
NA,voice in the management of their affairs.,130
NA,It is a marvellous thing indeed to know,130
NA,that the people of this country have the,130
NA,sole right to decide who shall govern them.,130
NA,My memory goes back a long way in,130
NA,"politics, and I have always thought it a",130
NA,wonderful thing that when we leave the,130
NA,House at the end of a parliament to go,130
NA,"to our masters, we know that our masters",130
NA,"will speak their minds in their own fashion,",130
NA,"and that we will accept their decision,",130
NA,"whatever it is, and the government of the",130
NA,country will go on.,130
NA,It is a marvellous system that we have,130
NA,"inherited, and I mention it only to give",130
NA,some background to what otherwise would,130
NA,be the formal speeches made on these,130
NA,occasions. I want to say that whatever,130
NA,the people may decide will be accepted by,130
NA,"me, and, I am sure, by all other members",130
NA,"of this Parliament, because we are demo-",130
NA,crats. Some of us have been here for,130
NA,"three years, and some of us have been here",130
NA,for many more years than that. We have,130
NA,"engaged in our debates, and we have",130
NA,occasionally given a very good imitation,130
NA,of quarrelling with each other. I received,130
NA,a little message the other day from a good,130
NA,"friend of mine, who is no political sup-",130
NA,"porter, to say that he had enjoyed, oddly",130
NA,"enough, a speech that I had made. I add",130
NA,at once that it was not made in this House.,130
NA,He said he had then found it necessary to,130
NA,go away and tell his constituents what an,130
NA,unreliable character I was. This is good.,130
NA,"It is, I think, splendid. I do not mind",130
NA,people saying this. What I do want to,130
NA,have preserved in Australia is the capacity,130
NA,of the people to form their own judgments,130
NA,and to speak their own minds. It is in that,130
NA,spirit that I express the hope that all the,130
NA,honorable members I see about me to-night,130
NA,will be back here after the election. I,130
NA,think this exhibits a warmth of feeling tbat,130
NA,I hope will be understood.,130
NA,Mr Cope -Wh y don't you go for the,130
NA,Senate?,130
Mr MENZIES ,Oddl y enough it is the,130
NA,only House in which I have never sat.,130
NA,will turn the suggestion over in my mind.,130
NA,I will treat the honorable member's,130
NA,tion as being on notice and I will give him,130
NA,an answer after 9th December.,130
NA,"Contrary to the public impression, we",130
NA,who are members of this Parliament really,130
NA,"enjoy a great deal of personal friendship,",130
NA,"whatever side we may sit on, and I am.",130
NA,"able, with the greatest good faith, to invite",130
NA,all honorable members to have a very happy,130
NA,Christmas and a very good New Year. In,130
NA,a personal sense I think we can wish each,130
NA,other well.,130
NA,"As for you, Mr Speaker, I shall not",130
NA,move tbat your ruling be disagreed with.,130
NA,I think that would be a most unhappy note,130
NA,"on which to end. You are, if you will",130
NA,"allow me to say so, a very remarkable man.",130
NA,"You have to give rulings this way or that,",130
NA,"but I must say that you have, throughout",130
NA,"the life of this Parliament, maintained a",130
NA,personal relationship with the members of,130
NA,the House which must give you as much,130
NA,satisfaction as it gives us. You go away,130
NA,from this Parliament leaving the,130
NA,""" Hansard"" reporters, who treat us so",130
NA,"generously, to attend to the volumes and",130
NA,put the reports in order; and leaving the,130
NA,"Clerks of the House, without whom we",130
NA,could not live in an orderly fashion. You,130
NA,go away leaving all of them to do what,130
NA,must be done. But you may be perfectly,130
NA,certain that you go away from this Parlia-,130
NA,ment with the personal goodwill of the,130
NA,members of the House.,130
NA,"Similar remarks, Sir, apply to the Chair-",130
NA,man of Committees and the temporary,130
NA,"chairmen. Even in these circumstances, at",130
NA,"2.35 on Friday morning, I say how much",130
NA,my colleagues and I are indebted to the,130
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell),130
NA,and Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr.,130
NA,Whitlam) for their co-operation in organiz-,130
NA,ing the business of the House. Perhaps the,130
NA,onlooker does not quite understand how,130
NA,important it is that the business of the,130
NA,House should proceed in an orderly and,130
NA,intelligible fashion. The Leader of the,130
NA,"House, my distinguished colleague the",130
NA,Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt)-t o whom I,130
NA,am immensely indebted for his assistance,130
NA,in these matters and in others-i s able to,130
NA,discuss with the Deputy Leader of the,130
NA,"Opposition, just as others before him have",130
NA,I discussed with the present Leader of the,130
NA,"Opposition, how things should be done in",130
NA,questhe House. It is very seldom that any,130
NA,genuine quarrel arises about how the busi-,130
NA,"ness should be organized, and I think we",130
NA,may all say that it has been organized with,131
NA,the one object of allowing a reasonable,131
NA,time for discussion and the reasonable,131
NA,"expression of all points of view, keeping in",131
NA,mind that there is a mass of legislation,131
NA,before the Parliament and that it has to be,131
NA,dealt with in proper fashion within a,131
NA,certain time.,131
NA,"Through you, Mr Speaker, I want to say",131
NA,"to my opposite number, the Leader of the",131
NA,"Opposition, in the time-honoured phrase,",131
NA,that I think he is a magnificent Leader of,131
NA,the Opposition. I think it is a role in,131
NA,which nature cast him. I say that just as,131
NA,"he, in his own day, said similar things to",131
NA,me when I was Leader of the Opposition.,131
NA,"At any rate, the Leader of the Opposition",131
NA,and I will always be able to look back on,131
NA,this Parliament and remember that we were,131
NA,civilized persons dealing with the business,131
NA,"of the country in a civilized House in, for-",131
NA,"tunately, a civilized and democratic",131
NA,country.,131
NA,I must say something about the Whips.,131
NA,I have always admired the way in which,131
NA,"the Speaker or the Chairman, as the case",131
NA,"may be, has said, as if the thought had",131
NA,"suddenly come to him, "" I appoint the",131
NA,honorable member for so-and-so and the,131
NA,"honorable member for so-and-so."" What",131
NA,we would do without competent Whips I,131
NA,do not know.,131
NA,Mr Haylen -Loo k what happened to,131
NA,Schumacher!,131
Mr MENZIES ,Quit e right. The task,131
NA,of the Whip is not an easy one; it is no,131
NA,sinecure. When the Whips stand back,131
NA,"and start counting, I am perfectly sure",131
NA,that they forget for the time being that,131
NA,they are politically opposed. They do their,131
NA,"work, and they do it to the great advantage",131
NA,of all of us.,131
NA,"Sir, 1 have made a slight reference to the reporters, the press correspondents.",131
NA,officers of the House. I have been sitting,131
NA,"in Parliament, in one House or another-",131
NA,"but not in the Senate, as I have been",131
NA,"reminded-bo y and man, as one might say,",131
NA,for 33 years.,131
NA,NA,131
Mr MENZIES ,Tha t is right. I was,131
NA,waiting for that. I am not sure that you,131
NA,"are not right; but anyhow, it is 33 years.",131
NA,In the whole of that time I have come to,131
NA,understand more and more perfectly how,131
NA,"vital it is to the business of the Parliament,",131
NA,to the orderly conduct of affairs that we,131
NA,"should have at the table, and not only at",131
NA,"the table but around the House, in the staff",131
NA,of this Parliament people who know their,131
NA,"business, who are familiar with the forms",131
NA,"of the House and who become, in a sense,",131
NA,the guardians of the proper procedures,131
NA,which make a parliament effective. There-,131
NA,"fore, I say to them how indebted I am to",131
NA,them and how indebted we all are to them.,131
NA,I do not want to dwell uneasily on the,131
NA,""" Hansard "" staff. When I first came into",131
NA,this House I was young and ardent and,131
NA,"had a deep suspicion of the "" Hansard""",131
NA,"staff, I suppose; I used to correct the proof",131
NA,sheets. Oh dear! I gave it up. I have,131
NA,not corrected one for twenty years and I,131
NA,still have to be told that I have been mis-,131
NA,reported in this House. This is something,131
NA,"to be said about the "" Hansard "" staff. They",131
NA,"have a dull, heavy, routine job at all hours",131
NA,of the day and night. They do not grumble,131
NA,"about it and they manage to come up,",131
NA,"day by day, with reports of speeches which,",131
NA,"if one read them, would astonish one by",131
NA,their intelligence and intelligibility. This,131
NA,is a wonderful achievement and I want to,131
NA,say how much indebted we are to the,131
NA,""" Hansard "" staff for it.",131
NA,"We are, of course, indebted to many",131
NA,"people who make our life, our useful life,",131
NA,our thoughtful life possible. There are,131
NA,those in charge of the Library from the,131
NA,Librarian to his assistants. I suppose we,131
NA,ought to say that we are indebted to the,131
NA,"broadcasters although, of course, whether",131
NA,that is true or not depends entirely on,131
NA,results of which we are at present happily,131
NA,unaware. Every time we sit we have,131
NA,"sitting above us, like Timotheus placed",131
NA,"on high amid the tuneful choir, the press",131
NA,I,131
NA,suppose that every member in the course,131
NA,of a session goes through a period when,131
NA,his attitude of mind could be described as,131
NA,one of utter anguish at what they have,131
NA,made of us. I sometimes have thought,131
NA,that they have not understood what I,131
NA,said and I have been very angry; I have,131
NA,sometimes realized that they have not,131
NA,understood what some opponent said and,131
NA,"I have been very pleased. So, it all",131
NA,"averages out, and we are indebted to them.",131
NA,"Now, Sir, there are many other people I",132
NA,should mention. It is the habit to talk about,132
NA,"civil servants as if they did not matter, as",132
NA,if they were a strange race isolated from,132
NA,mankind. Every man who has been in,132
NA,"office, whether subsequently he has been in",132
NA,"Opposition or not, knows how much we owe",132
NA,to the people in the Civil Service to whom,132
NA,we refer for information and upon whose,132
NA,information we can rely. When I look at,132
NA,"the annual volumes of the statutes, so many",132
NA,of which have been contributed by my own,132
NA,"Government, I recall the incredible work",132
NA,done by the parliamentary draftsmen week,132
NA,"after week, month after month and year",132
NA,"after year, reducing into statutory -form the",132
NA,"observations of Ministers which, if I may",132
NA,betray one of the secrets with which my,132
NA,"friend opposite is familiar, are not always",132
NA,as clear as all that. We are greatly in-,132
NA,debted to them.,132
NA,There is the general staff of the Houses,132
NA,"of the Parliament, moving from the refreshin",132
NA,ment-rooms towards the front of the success,132
NA,building and around the corridors; the,132
NA,people who make the setting of tbis 'Parlianess,132
NA,"ment House so lovely. They are not known,",132
NA,"very frequently, by name, but tbey make family circle.",132
NA,their contribution to the existence of a,132
NA,parliament in a national capital in a beauti-,132
NA,ful setting. That .there should be a great,132
NA,national capital in a beautiful and civilized,132
NA,setting in Australia I have no doubt whatdemocracy,132
NA,ever. 1 think that it means something far,132
NA,more than the rather casual critic may sup-,132
NA,pose.,132
NA,No doubt I have omitted a variety of,132
NA,-people; but I do want to take the oppor-,132
NA,"tunity, even-i f I may repeat myself-a",132
NA,"this late hour of the day, or this early",132
NA,"of the day, to say that this session ends",132
NA,this Parliament .ends with a great fund,132
NA,".goodwill, with, I suppose, in most of us",132
NA,feeling of excitement about what is going,132
NA,"happen in the next six weeks; but, however",132
NA,hard the blows that are struck in the next,132
NA,"weeks may be, all of us can think of people",132
NA,opposed to us politically in this place,132
NA,"whom we have a warm, ""human and generous",132
NA,feeling.,132
NA,Mr -CALWELL -(Melbourne-Leade r of,132
NA,"Ihe Opposition) [247 a.ma] -Mt . Speaker,",132
NA,I support -everything that tbe Prime Minthey,132
NA,ister ( Mr Menziea) has said. It is not,132
NA,always that I agree w.ith everything that be -vettes.,132
NA,"says, but on occasions I have agreed with",132
NA,bis remarks in their entirety. 1 wrote,132
NA,myself an aide memoire in order that I,132
NA,would not forget anybody if the Prime,132
NA,Minister had forgotten somebody. The,132
NA,only people whom he included but perhaps,132
NA,did not particularize and whom I might,132
NA,mention are the telephonists who help us,132
NA,out so very much; and the members of,132
NA,the Police Force who do help us on occa-,132
NA,sions when we need their services; though,132
NA,it is the sight of them more than their,132
NA,activity which helps to preserve law and,132
NA,"order in this very peaceful, law-abiding",132
NA,National Capital.,132
NA,"Now, Sir, I would be hypocritical if I",132
NA,were to wish all our political opponents,132
NA,success on 9th December. I will not do,132
NA,"that, but I will wisb them good health. I",132
NA,wish every member of the Parliament good,132
NA,health because there is no substitute for,132
NA,good health. I wish them all happiness,132
NA,their family lives. I wish them all,132
NA,in their homes with their children,132
NA,",and their grandchildren, and all the happi-",132
NA,that comes with the joys-th e little,132
NA,joys and the great joys-tha t come to the,132
NA,"We do live in .a democracy, Sir. It is a",132
NA,very great privilege to live in a democracy.,132
NA,"The more we Hhink of it, the more we",132
NA,realize just how few real examples of,132
NA,there are in the world and how,132
NA,few countries really practise democracy.,132
NA,"Even some of the great European nations,",132
NA,"which are so powerful, so rich with mem-",132
NA,"ories and in history and so great in culture,",132
NA,;,132
NA,'have yet never practised democracy in the,132
NA,"t way we practise it. To me "" democracy """,132
NA,hour -means government by the majority of the,132
NA,and people. Democracy rests upon the will .of,132
NA,of .the majority. 'Somebody has said that,132
NA,a there is nothing sacred in the rule of 99,132
NA,".to over 1 ,or of 51 over 49, but that is the",132
NA,only principle upon which a civilized,132
NA,six society can he carried .on. Anything other,132
NA,than that <is a tyranny of one sort or,132
NA,for another.. .So long as we are prepared to,132
NA,"accept majority decisions, particularly",132
NA,"when we do not like them, we can be sure",132
NA,that our form of 'society and our way of,132
NA,life will endure. If -the people make a,132
NA,mistake on the occasion of one election,132
NA,"pay for ,it, and at a subsequent election",132
NA,they have :their -opportunity to reverse their,132
NA,The Prime Minister expressed the,133
NA,opinion that I was well fitted for the post,133
NA,of Leader of the Opposition. His remark,133
NA,reminded me of other occasions of twelve,133
NA,and more years ago when I and others said,133
NA,the same sort of thing about him. I assure,133
NA,the right honorable gentleman and other,133
NA,honorable members opposite that I have no,133
NA,intention of making the position of Leader,133
NA,of the Opposition a permanent occupation,133
NA,for myself if I can avoid doing so. How-,133
NA,"ever, that all depends on the will of the",133
NA,majority. Whatever the will of the,133
NA,"majority may be, I accept it gladly-th e",133
NA,will of the people in the first instance and,133
NA,the will of my colleagues in the second,133
NA,instance. Nobody should occupy any,133
NA,position in a democracy unless he occupies,133
NA,it with the goodwill and the freely given,133
NA,consent of all the people with whom he is,133
NA,associated.,133
NA,We have had our differences and our,133
NA,difficulties in the Twenty-third Parliament,133
NA,of the Commonwealth. We have seen,133
NA,difficult times. We have conjured up,133
NA,possibilities of great danger confronting,133
NA,and the world. Thanks to a beneficent,133
NA,"providence, we have lived through all",133
NA,difficulties unscathed so far. Let us hope,133
NA,that in the lifetime of the Twenty-fourth,133
NA,Parliament Australia and the world will,133
NA,escape the terrors and the horrors of,133
NA,third world war or even a limited war in,133
NA,any part of the world. Man yearns for,133
NA,peace. Men and women everywhere want,133
NA,"peace. Surely, in the twentieth century of selves.",133
NA,"the Christian era of our civilization,",133
NA,ought to be able to find some ways,133
NA,means by which we can avoid war and,133
NA,enable mankind to live in peace.,133
NA,"Mr Speaker, the members of the Opposiperiod.",133
NA,tion wish you well. You have been stern,133
NA,on occasions. Perhaps we have provoked,133
NA,you a little and you have taken action,133
NA,because you felt that the Standing Orders,133
NA,obliged you to do so. We bear you no to,133
NA,ill will. We wish you and your wife,133
NA,very happy Christmas and a prosperous,133
NA,New Year. We extend similar good wishes,133
NA,to all honorable members who sit on your,133
NA,"right. For myself, I wish every member",133
NA,"of the Parliament, whatever the result",133
NA,"-the election may be, a very happy and",133
NA,peaceful Christmas and a prosperous,133
NA,joyful New Year.,133

Mr MCEWEN ,Murray-Ministe r for,133
NA,"Trade) [2.53 a.m.] - Mr Speaker, I should",133
NA,"like to associate myself, as I am sure all",133
NA,the members of the Australian Country,133
NA,"Party would like to associate themselves,",133
NA,with the sentiments that have been expressed,133
NA,by the Prime Minister ( Mr Menzies). and,133
NA,the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell).,133
NA,Immediately before the dissolution of this,133
NA,"Parliament and so near to Christmas time,",133
NA,we extend personal good wishes to all the,133
NA,members of the Parliament and to their,133
NA,"families. To them all, we extend best",133
NA,wishes for Christmas.,133
NA,"During the life of this Parliament, we",133
NA,have lived through dramatic days in world,133
NA,affairs. All of us who have participated in,133
NA,the activities of this Parliament can look,133
NA,back and feel that we have had an,133
NA,opportunity to play our part on our stage,133
NA,in days of dramatic consequence to this,133
NA,country and to all societies.,133
NA,This occasion has particular significance,133
NA,"for me and my colleagues, because two of",133
NA,the our number do not propose to come back,133
NA,us to the Parliament. My very old and dis-,133
NA,tinguished friend the honorable member for,133
NA,"those Gippsland ( Mr Bowden), who has served",133
NA,"his country very well in war and in peace,",133
NA,and who has served this Parliament and,133
NA,"my party very well, is not standing again",133
NA,a for election. I express to him in his,133
NA,absence the very best of good wishes. That,133
NA,is a sentiment with which I am sure all,133
NA,honorable members wish to associate them-,133
NA,"My colleague, the honorable",133
NA,"we member for Canning ( Mr Hamilton), also,",133
NA,"and has served his country in war, on two",133
NA,"occasions, and has served in peace in this",133
NA,Parliament with distinction for a very long,133
NA,The honorable member has had the,133
NA,unique experience of being for a time the,133
NA,only representative from a State on the,133
NA,non-Labour side of politics in this House.,133
NA,The honorable member does not propose,133
NA,contest an election again after his long,133
NA,a service. I am sure that every member of,133
NA,tbe Parliament wishes to extend good,133
NA,"wishes to him on his retirement, Mr.",133
NA,Speaker. We have the same thoughts in,133
NA,our minds for the honorable member for,133
NA,of Warringah ( Mr Bland) and the honorable,133
NA,"member for Brisbane ( Mr George Lawson),",133
NA,and each of whom has given distinguished,133
NA,service here.,133
NA,The rest of us will attempt to come back,134
NA,and to uphold the principles that we stand,134
NA,"for, and especially the traditions of this",134
NA,Parliament. I believe that we who are,134
NA,and have been members of the Australian,134
NA,National Parliament have had the great,134
NA,distinction of legislating for and governing,134
NA,what I have come to believe is the most,134
NA,completely classless society among all the,134
NA,"nations. That is a very good thing indeed,",134
NA,"if it be true, as I think it is. The character",134
NA,of our society is reflected in the character,134
NA,and the conduct of this Parliament.,134
NA,"We are indebted to you, Mr Speaker,",134
NA,for the dignity and capacity with which,134
NA,perform the functions of your high office.,134
NA,"Thank you, Sir. I address similar remarks",134
NA,"to my colleague, the Chairman of Comdid",134
NA,"mittees ( Mr Lucock), who himself plays",134
NA,distinguished part in the service of,134
NA,"Parliament, and also to the Temporary",134
NA,"Chairmen whom you, Sir, have appointed.",134
NA,I express to the Leader of the Opposition,134
NA,"my thanks for his courtesies. On occasions,",134
NA,we engage in verbal rough and tumble.,134
NA,"However, I wish to say publicly that, in",134
NA,"personal relationships, I have nothing",134
NA,"profound respect for the honorable gentledifficulties,",134
NA,man. I also express my personal good,134
NA,wishes to his deputy and to all who,134
NA,"behind him. The Whips play their part,",134
NA,we thank them. There are many who comsomewhat,134
NA,"prise the staff which serves the Parliament,",134
NA,and they have been mentioned by the Prime,134
NA,Minister and the Leader of the Opposition.,134
NA,I associate myself personally and the any actual movement.,134
NA,members of my party with all tbe,134
NA,expressions of goodwill appropriate to,134
NA,staff of the Parliament.,134
Mr WARD ,East Sydney) [2.58 a.m.],134
NA,"Mr Speaker, this is the last occasion",134
NA,which the Parliament will meet prior to,134
NA,"election, and, as one of the members who",134
NA,"have prospects of returning to this place,",134
NA,I want to raise with you a matter concernbers,134
NA,ing the facilities in this building. I am,134
NA,sure for how long your authority will lighting,134
NA,"extend, Sir, and I trust that it",134
NA,"for too long. However, I hope that it will",134
NA,survive sufficiently long to enable you,134
NA,rectify the matter to which I wish to direct,134
NA,"attention. At about this time of the year,",134
NA,at the conclusion of the last sittings of,134
NA,"Parliament before Christmas, jt is",134
NA,practice for members to have little celeParliament,134
NA,"brations. In my opinion, the facilities for",134
NA,these functions appear to be inadequate.,134
NA,"Early this morning, when I was preparing",134
NA,to depart for Hotel Kurrajong,134
NA,Mr Jess -Wa s the honorable member,134
NA,snooping?,134
Mr WARD , I was not. As a matter,134
NA,"of fact, I was in company with a couple",134
NA,of my colleagues. We were proceeding,134
NA,to my office to get some papers before we,134
NA,"left for the hotel. I am a music lover,",134
NA,and I heard music coming from one of the,134
NA,offices. Which one was not clear to me.,134
NA,"Being of a very inquiring nature, and being",134
NA,"you attracted by the music, I decided to do a",134
NA,"little investigating, and I discovered from",134
NA,which office the music was emanating. I,134
NA,not knock on the door or open it.,134
NA,a It was opened for me. Immediately it,134
NA,"the was opened I said ""Goodnight"", and the",134
NA,door was slammed rather rudely in my,134
NA,face. I am not showing any resentment,134
NA,and I do not propose to mention the names,134
NA,of the only two people that I identified-,134
NA,members of the Government parties-bu t,134
NA,I was rather upset to think that they were,134
NA,but having their amusement under such great,134
NA,because the room was crowded.,134
NA,I would not say that it was large enough,134
NA,sit to accommodate all the members of the,134
NA,"and Liberal and Country Parties, but it was",134
NA,crowded and it appeared to me,134
NA,that it was not rock 'n' roll that was going,134
NA,on in there. It was that cheek-to-cheek,134
NA,"kind of dancing, more of a shuffle without",134
NA,The reason I raise this matter with you,134
NA,"the now, Mr Speaker, is that evidently in",134
NA,some of the offices round this building the,134
NA,- lighting is faulty because there was no,134
NA,on light on in that room. It was in complete,134
NA,"the darkness. I think that you, as the custo-",134
NA,"dian of the House, ought to see that the",134
NA,lighting in the building is such that mem-,134
NA,who want to have a little quiet enjoy-,134
NA,not ment are not handicapped by the lack of,134
NA,in their offices when these festivi-,134
NA,will not last ties are being held.,134
NA,The only other matter which I want to,134
NA,"to raise concerns my colleague, the honorable",134
NA,"member for Brisbane ( Mr George Lawson),",134
NA,who is not here to listen to what I have,134
NA,the to say about him. I want to say au revoir,134
NA,the to him. George Lawson has been in this,134
NA,a long time. It has been rather,134
NA,a matter of dispute between George and,135
NA,me as to which of us has the longer period,135
NA,of continuous membership of the Parlia-,135
NA,ment. We bave not put it on tbe basis of,135
NA,non-continuous membership because I,135
NA,came here early in 1931. I was temporarily,135
NA,"defeated at the end of that year, when",135
NA,"George was elected, and he claims that he",135
NA,has longer membership of the Parliament,135
NA,than I have. I am prepared to concede,135
NA,that distinction to him if it will give him,135
NA,any pleasure or satisfaction. He has been,135
NA,a great old stalwart of the Labour Party.,135
NA,He served in a Labour government with,135
NA,great distinction and I think that he can,135
NA,go out of this Parliament realizing that he,135
NA,has friends and deserves the respect of all,135
NA,the members of the Labour Party with,135
NA,whom he was associated during those years.,135
Mr HAMILTON ,Canning) [3.2 a.m.] -,135
NA,It is not usual for me to join in the,135
NA,"speeches at a time such as this, but on this",135
NA,occasion I should like to support the remarks,135
NA,"made by the Prime Minister ( Mr Menzies),",135
NA,the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell),135
NA,and the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister,135
NA,for Trade ( Mr MCEwen). If I wished to,135
NA,crow over other members of this House I,135
NA,"could say, "" I know where I'm going "" but",135
NA,I do not want to speak in that strain. This,135
NA,will be my last appearance here. At the,135
NA,"outset I want to pay my respects to you,",135
NA,"Mr Speaker, and to thank you for the treat-",135
NA,ment I have had at your hands. I also ex-,135
NA,press my appreciation of the treatment I,135
NA,have had at the hands of Speakers who have,135
NA,preceded you during the time I have served,135
NA,in this Parliament.,135
NA,I want also to take this opportunity to,135
NA,"express my appreciation to the electors of,",135
NA,"first, the division of Swan, in Western Aus-",135
NA,"tralia and, secondly, the division",135
NA,for having placed their confidence in me and,135
NA,allowed me to be a member of this Com-,135
NA,"monwealth Parliament. I say that, because",135
NA,I consider it to be an honour to be one of,135
NA,"124 people who here represent 10,500,000",135
NA,people. In that regard I support every word,135
NA,that the Prime Minister said a few moments,135
NA,ago and which were so ably supported also,135
NA,"by the Leader of the Opposition, about the",135
NA,democratic system under which we live. I,135
NA,think that I would be ignoring my personal,135
NA,desires if I did not say at this stage to the,135
NA,Ministers in this Parliament and previous,135
NA,"Parliaments in which I have served, "" Thank",135
NA,you very much for your assistance and,135
NA,"advice"". I include the Leader of the",135
NA,Opposition in that expression of apprecia-,135
NA,tion because when I first came here he was,135
NA,a Minister of the Crown and although I was,135
NA,on the opposite side of the political fence,135
NA,he proved to be a very good friend to me,135
NA,and gave me some excellent advice in those,135
NA,first few years. I thank him for that.,135
NA,I should also like to express my thanks,135
NA,and appreciation to the officers of this Par-,135
NA,"liament. The present Clerk of the House,",135
NA,"who is at the moment on leave, was Sergeant-",135
NA,at-Arms when I first arrived here. I had,135
NA,not been here more than an hour when he,135
NA,"conducted me and my friend, now tbe Post-",135
NA,"master-General ( Mr Davidson), round this",135
NA,place so that we would understand where,135
NA,we were. To the officers of the House,135
NA,"generally I say, "" Thank you very much for",135
NA,all the help you have given me in the fifteen,135
NA,"years I have been here "".",135
NA,I should also like to include in my ex-,135
NA,pression of appreciation the members of the,135
NA,""" Hansard "" staff for the way in which they",135
NA,garnish our speeches. My friend George,135
NA,"Bowden, who I regret is not here, once said",135
NA,that our speeches read like political orations.,135
NA,Before I leave this chamber I should like,135
NA,to say thanks to the uniformed attendants,135
NA,who do a marvellous job for members.,135
NA,"They are always very courteous, understand-",135
NA,ing and helpful and each of us owes them,135
NA,a debt of gratitude for the work they do,135
NA,so silently as they move on these carpeted,135
NA,floors and in other places. I should also like,135
NA,to mention the officers of the Library.,135
NA,Since I have been here I have never been,135
NA,afraid to approach them for assistance in,135
NA,reference books or information. To them I,135
NA,"of Canning, express my thanks.",135
NA,There is another body of people in this,135
NA,Parliament to whom honorable members,135
NA,"owe something. At least, that is my experi-",135
NA,ence. I refer to the private secretaries of the,135
NA,Ministers who certainly do a really good,135
NA,job to help us in the task we have under-,135
NA,"taken here. Then, too, are the members of",135
NA,"the loint House Department, particularly",135
NA,"those in the refreshment rooms, where we",135
NA,can get good solid and liquid refreshment,135
NA,at any hour of the day or night. I thank,135
NA,the transport officers and drivers. In the,135
NA,fifteen years I have been here it has never,135
NA,been my experience to find a driver or any-,136
NA,body else connected with our transport,136
NA,arrangements who has not shown the utmost,136
NA,courtesy in helping us.,136
NA,Some references were made to the press.,136
NA,When I came here members of the Parlia-,136
NA,ment frequently played cricket against the,136
NA,press and the private secretaries. Un-,136
NA,"fortunately, nowadays those social gather-",136
NA,ings seem to have gone by the board. I,136
NA,recommend to some of you the adoption,136
NA,of some of the ideas of the Crazy Gang,136
NA,"and learn to live and enjoy yourselves,",136
NA,because do not forget that-,136
NA,A little nonsense now and then,136
NA,Is relished by the wisest men.,136
NA,We used to sing a rollicking song when,136
NA,"we came onto the field, the burden of",136
NA,"which was "" Curse the press! "" I should",136
NA,like to-night to reverse that and say,136
NA,"""Praise the press"" because as Sir George",136
NA,"Reid once said "" You can write me up or",136
NA,"you can write me down, but for heaven's",136
NA,"sake don't ignore me."" What the press",136
NA,does to a member of Parliament one way,136
NA,of the other can be turned to a valuable,136
NA,result. That is my experience in public,136
NA,life.,136
NA,I have heard a lot of people both in,136
NA,"this Parliament, unfortunately, and outside",136
NA,speak in very derogatory terms of the,136
NA,Public Service. My experience of the,136
NA,Public Service is that it is formed of a,136
NA,band of people imbued with the spirit of,136
NA,doing a. job for this country. We cannot,136
NA,expect each and every one of them to be,136
NA,"perfect, but by and large the members of",136
NA,the Public Service do well the jobs that,136
NA,"they are there to do. This Parliament,",136
NA,and parliaments which have preceeded it,136
NA,owe a debt of gratitude to the Public,136
NA,Service for the work that it does and I,136
NA,am happy to thank the Public Service for,136
NA,that. Parliaments in the future will owe,136
NA,a similar debt of gratitude to the service.,136
NA,I should like to say that this institution-,136
NA,of Parliament- is one of the finest things,136
NA,it has been my pleasure to know. Those of,136
NA,us who have sat here and those who will sit,136
NA,"here must realize that, to protect the demo-",136
NA,cratic idea as expressed by tbe Prime,136
NA,"Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, a",136
NA,certain amount of dignity is required. We,136
NA,"swap punches politically, but I think we can",136
NA,do it in a way that will uphold the prestige,136
NA,of the parliamentary institution. Although,136
NA,I have engaged in verbal battles not only,136
NA,with my friends on the Opposition but also,136
NA,with my friends on the Government side of,136
NA,"the House, I have enjoyed every minute of",136
NA,it. I think I can say truthfully that although,136
NA,we have hopped into one another with,136
NA,"words, I have never engaged in personalities",136
NA,and nobody has engaged in personalities,136
NA,against me. I have never had a quorum,136
NA,called on me by the honorable member for,136
NA,East Sydney. I go out of the Parliament,136
NA,thanking him for that. He has never smiled,136
NA,at me as he has done at the honorable mem-,136
NA,"ber for Wimmera, but I do not think he",136
NA,ever had the pleasure of calling a quorum,136
NA,"on me. Finally, I say, "" Merry Christmas",136
NA,"and Happy New Year."" I cannot say",136
NA,""" Good luck,"" but I say "" Good health "" to",136
NA,everybody.,136
Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. John MCLeay).,136
NA,- I thank the Prime Minister ( Mr.,136
NA,"Menzies), the Leader of the Opposition",136
NA,"( Mr Calwell), the Minister for Trade",136
NA,( Mr MCEwen) and the honorable member,136
NA,for Canning ( Mr Hamilton). I am not,136
NA,quite sure where I stand with the honorable-,136
NA,"member for East Sydney ( Mr Ward), but",136
NA,I shall take it for granted. I appreciate,136
NA,the kindly references you have made to,136
NA,"myself and I express my thanks, not only",136
NA,"to you folk, but also to all honorable",136
NA,members on both sides of the House for,136
NA,"their tolerance, their understanding, their",136
NA,"sympathy and, above all, their loyalty in",136
NA,supporting the institution of the Parliament,136
NA,during my term of office.,136
NA,"I thank everybody under the control, of.",136
NA,"the Clerk, every member of the "" Hansard """,136
NA,"staff associated with the House, and the",136
NA,Joint House Committee and itsstaff. I,136
NA,thank also tbe staff of the Parliamentary,136
NA,"Library, the members of the Library Com-",136
NA,mittee and the members of all the other,136
NA,committees associated witb the manage-,136
NA,ment and control of the Parliament. I,136
NA,want to say a special word of praise of my,136
NA,own personal staff and those associated,136
NA,with me. I want to thank those who have,136
NA,handled the very delicate problem of the,136
NA,galleries and the other problems that have,136
NA,arisen. I hope the same loyalty will always,136
NA,be extended to whoever occupies the hon-,136
NA,oured position of Speaker.,136
NA,So far as the members of press are con-,136
NA,"cerned, particularly those who have been",136
NA,associated with the directions issued by,137
NA,those in control during my term as pre-,137
NA,"siding officer in this House, I have found",137
NA,that they have always respected the,137
NA,requests we have made. I express to them,137
NA,my appreciation of their co-operation and,137
NA,assistance in anything that came under,137
NA,my control.,137
NA,On behalf of all those who will not be,137
NA,"able to speak for themselves, I want to",137
NA,express to you their appreciation of the,137
NA,very kind things you have said. On behalf,137
NA,of those who are here for the purpose of,137
NA,"serving the House, I would say that they",137
NA,are very grateful and very pleased to have,137
NA,the opportunity of rendering to you the,137
NA,services it is their obligation to render.,137
NA,"We say "" au revoir"" to those who are",137
NA,going out of the Parliament by their own,137
NA,desire. To any of those who I am not,137
NA,able to isolate but who will not be return-,137
NA,"ing, I say that I wish them good health in",137
NA,the event of the reaper being a little rough.,137
NA,I take this opportunity of extending to you,137
NA,all greetings for the coming year.,137
NA,Question resolved in the affirmative.,137
NA,House adjourned at 3.15 a.m. (Friday),137
NA,to a date and hour to be fixed by Mr.,137
NA,Speaker.,137
NA,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS.,137
NA,The following answers to questions were,137
NA,circulated:-,137
NA,Immigration.,137
NA,Mr Beazley asked the Minister for,137
NA,"Immigration, upon notice-",137
NA,1. Has his attention been drawn to a statement,137
NA,"appearing in "" British Voice in Australia"", No.",137
NA,"1, Spring, 1961, at page 2, that (a) Australia is",137
NA,losing more than half of her,137
NA,(b) their departure rate is much higher than for,137
NA,"any other nationality, (c) the figures issued by",137
NA,"the Commonwealth Statistician, Mr S. R. Carver,",137
NA,"show that in 1960, 53,494 people arrived from",137
NA,"the United Kingdom and Ireland and 30,804 left",137
NA,permanently thus representing a loss of 58 per,137
NA,"cent., (d) the figures are contained in the",137
NA,""" Demographic Review"" No. 126; if so, is the",137
NA,position as stated?,137
NA,"2. In reading the "" Demographic Review "" is it",137
NA,"correct to assume, in the case of departures,",137
NA,where the country of intended future residence is,137
NA,"shown in the United Kingdom or Ireland, that",137
NA,the numbers of persons returning to those,137
NA,"countries are "" British new arrivals""?",137
NA,F.8842/61 -R -[97 ],137
NA,3. If the Government's estimate of the return,137
NA,rate of British new arrivals differs from that,137
NA,"shown in "" British Voice in Australia"", what is",137
NA,the Government's estimate?,137
NA,4. How is the estimate made?,137
NA,Mr Downer -Th e answers to the,137
NA,honorable member's questions are as,137
NA,follows:-,137
NA,1. This article seriously misinterprets the infor-,137
NA,mation published in the Australian Demographic,137
NA,Review by the Commonwealth Statistician. As,137
NA,is plainly stated on the front page of the,137
NA,""" Review"", the figures do not purport to indicate",137
NA,"permanent migration as such. Moreover, the",137
NA,actualfiguresquoted in the article do not refer to,137
NA,recent United Kingdom citizens returning to the,137
NA,United Kingdom. They do not even refer to,137
NA,British nationals- a term which does not only,137
NA,apply to citizens of the United Kingdom. In,137
NA,"fact, the figures quoted are concerned with move-",137
NA,"ments to and from the United Kingdom,",137
NA,"irrespective of nationality. Moreover, it is not",137
NA,"even correct to say that 30,804 people-irre -",137
NA,spective of nationality-lef t permanently for the,137
NA,"United Kingdom. For example, thisfigureincludes",137
NA,all Australians who intend to stay in the United,137
NA,"Kingdom for a year or more, regardless of the",137
NA,fact that they intend to return here.,137
NA,"2. For the reasons indicated above, it is not",137
NA,correct to assume that the departure figures,137
NA,"represent "" British new arrivals"" returning to the",137
NA,United Kingdom.,137
NA,3. The best available evidence indicates that,137
NA,the effective returnee rate is approximately 6 per,137
NA,cent.,137
NA,4. This estimate is based on information,137
NA,obtained by my department concerning assisted,137
NA,migrants from the United Kingdom who return,137
NA,"home, and does not relate to the traditional free-",137
NA,flow of British people to and from Australia out-,137
NA,side the assisted passage scheme.,137
NA,Travelling Allowances Paid to,137
NA,Parliamentary Secretaries.,137
NA,"Mr Cope asked the Prime Minister,",137
NA,upon notice-,137
NA,In what circumstances and at what rate is a,137
NA,travelling allowance paid to Parliamentary Sec-,137
NA,retaries (a) within Australia and (b) outside,137
NA,"British new arrivals, Australia?",137
NA,Mr Menzies -Th e answer to the honor-,137
NA,able member's question is as follows:-,137
NA,Parliamentary Secretaries receive a travelling,137
NA,"allowance, apart from their entitlement as mem-",137
NA,"bers, only when travelling on ministerial business",137
NA,within Australia other than in Canberra. The,137
NA,travelling allowance is at the rate of £10 per,137
NA,day as recommended by the Committee of Enquiry,137
NA,into the Salaries and Allowances of Members of,137
NA,"the Commonwealth Parliament, 1959. Outside",137
NA,Australia they do not receive a daily rate of,137
NA,travelling allowance. Expenses of an official,137
NA,overseas visit on ministerial business would be,137
NA,an official charge.,137
NA,Excise Duties on Petroleum Products.,138
NA,Mr Costa asked the Minister for Ship-,138
NA,"ping and Transport, upon notice-",138
NA,1. What revenue has been received by the,138
NA,Commonwealth from excise duties on petroleum,138
NA,products since the inception of the duties?,138
NA,2. What amount has been returned to the,138
NA,States for road construction?,138
NA,3. Has the Commonwealth financed the con-,138
NA,struction of any strategic roads out of the,138
NA,"revenue received from these duties; if so, which",138
NA,roads were so constructed?,138
NA,Mr Opperman - The answers to the,138
NA,honorable member's questions are as,138
NA,follows:-,138
NA,"1. Commencing in 1902 and up to 30th June,",138
NA,"1961, an amount of £658 million has been",138
NA,collected in customs and excise duty on petrol,138
NA,and diesel fuel. This figure includes duties on,138
NA,"aviation fuels up to 30th June, 1946, which",138
NA,cannot be segregated from the total amount as,138
NA,separate records were not then maintained. How-,138
NA,"ever, it does not include duties on aviation fuels",138
NA,"after 1st July, 1947.",138
NA,2. Commonwealth grants to the States foi,138
NA,"road construction between 1923, when the first",138
NA,"roads grant was made, and 30th June, 1961,",138
NA,amount to £379 million.,138
NA,3. Since 1946-47 when the Commonwealth Aid,138
NA,Roads legislation empowered the Minister for,138
NA,Shipping and Transport to declare a road a,138
NA,"strategic road an amount of £4,580,507 has been",138
NA,authorized for expenditure on the maintenance,138
NA,and repair of the following roads:-,138
NA,"Queensland-Barkly , Inland Defence and",138
NA,Central Highways.,138
NA,South Australia-Eyr e Highway.,138
NA,"Western Australia-Eyr e Highway, Great",138
NA,"Northern Highway, Geraldton/Learmonth",138
NA,Road.,138
NA,Northern Territory - - Stuart and Barkly,138
NA,- Highways.,138
NA,Strategic roads are no longer provided for in,138
NA,the current Commonwealth Aid Roads Act 1959.,138
NA,Unemployment Statistics.,138
Mr REYNOLDS , the Minister f o r,138
NA,"Labour and National Service,",138
NA,notice-,138
NA,What is the estimated value of the loss in (a),138
NA,"production, (b) wages and salaries and (c) business",138
NA,"profits, which occurred in each of the momhs",138
NA,"from January to August, 1961, due to unemploy-",138
NA,ment and the curtailment of employment and,138
NA,earning capacity?,138
NA,Mr M c M a h o n - T h e answer,138
NA,honorable member's question is,138
NA,lows:-,138
NA,Insufficient statistical data is available to enable,138
NA,an estimate to be made.,138
Mr WHITLAM , the Minister for,138
NA,"Labour and National Service, upon notice-",138
NA,1. Why does he not publish in his monthly,138
NA,review of tbe employment situation the number,138
NA,of migrants for whom the Commonwealth Em-,138
NA,ployment Service (a) has not found their first,138
NA,"employment in Australia, and (b) has recom-",138
NA,mended special benefits?,138
NA,2. Why does he exclude such migrants from the,138
NA,general statistics of persons for whom the Com-,138
NA,monwealth Employment Service (a) has not found,138
NA,employment and (b) has recommended unemploy-,138
NA,ment benefits?,138
NA,Mr MCMahon -Th e answer to the,138
NA,honorable member's questions is as,138
NA,follows:-,138
NA,It is a cardinal rule of the Commonwealth,138
NA,Employment Service that it makes no discrimina-,138
NA,tion among those registering for employment,138
NA,whether on grounds of nationality or otherwise.,138
NA,It follows that it does not prepare separate satis-,138
NA,tics relating to migrants registered with it. Such,138
NA,migrants whether seeking their first or subsequent,138
NA,employment are subject to what follows included,138
NA,in the statistics published monthly.,138
NA,Assisted passage migrants who are accommo-,138
NA,dated in the Depanment of Immigration migrant,138
NA,reception and accommodation centres pending,138
NA,movement to hostels or private accommodation,138
NA,and entry into initial employment have not since,138
NA,the inception of the post-war immigration pro-,138
NA,gramme been included in the published statistics,138
NA,of persons registered for employment and for the,138
NA,following reasons. These migrants do not become,138
NA,immediately available for employment on their,138
NA,"arrival in the centres. Moreover, the uneven^",138
NA,ness of shipping arrivals has a more pronounced,138
NA,effect on the fluctuating numbers of workers ac-,138
NA,commodated than the availability of employment.,138
NA,Statistics of assisted passage migrants who receive,138
NA,special benefit payments while awaiting entry into,138
NA,initial employment are published regularly by the,138
NA,Commonwealth Statistician.,138
NA,Education.,138
Mr REYNOLDS ," the Prime Minister,",138
NA,upon notice-,138
NA,1. Has he replied to the request of the State,138
NA,"Premiers, made at the 1961 Premiers' Conference,",138
NA,for (a) an immediate special financial grant to,138
NA,"the States for the purposes of primary, secondary",138
NA,"upon and technical education, and (b) a national in-",138
NA,quiry into the long-term needs of these levels of,138
NA,education?,138
NA,"2. If so, what decision did he communicate to",138
NA,the Premiers?,138
NA,"3. I f he has not yet replied, when does be",138
NA,intend to do so?,138
NA,Mr Menzies -Th e answers to the,138
NA,honorable member's questions are as f o l -,138
NA,to the,138
NA,lows:-,138
NA,as fol-,138
NA,"1, 2 and 3. On 26th September I spoke about",138
NA,these matters in the House. I drew attention to,138
NA,the fact that financial arrangements made by this,138
NA,Government have enabled State governments to,138
NA,"lift their educational expenditure from £34,000,000",139
NA,"per annum to £140,000,000 per annum over the",139
NA,past ten years. I pointed out that the Govern-,139
NA,ment had established the Universities Commission,139
NA,and appointed a committee to report on the costs,139
NA,of teaching hospitals. More recently we estab-,139
NA,lished a committee to study and report on the,139
NA,future pattern of tertiary education in this country.,139
NA,Future action should obviously await receipt and,139
NA,consideration of the findings of this committee.,139
NA,Employment of School Leavers.,139
NA,Mr Bird asked the Minister for Labour,139
NA,"and National Service, upon notice-",139
NA,1. Has his department made a survey of the,139
NA,"number of primary, secondary and tertiary school",139
NA,pupils who will leave school at the end of the,139
NA,present year and become job-seekers at the,139
NA,beginning of next year?,139
NA,2. Has an estimate yet been made of the,139
NA,number of jobs expected to be vacant in 1962,139
NA,to absorb these students in full-time employ-,139
NA,ment?,139
NA,3. How many of these former school pupils,139
NA,are likely to be unable to secure employment,139
NA,and for what periods are they expected to remain,139
NA,unemployed?,139
NA,Mr MCMahon -Th e answers to the,139
NA,honorable member's questions are as,139
NA,follows:-,139
NA,1 and 2. As is usual at this time of the year,139
NA,officers of the Commonwealth Employment Ser-,139
NA,vice are extending their regular contacts with the,139
NA,schools with the object of obtaining as complete,139
NA,details as possible of students who may require,139
NA,assistance in securing employment. Likewise,139
NA,the Commonwealth Employment Service is,139
NA,stepping up its canvass of employers for vacan-,139
NA,cies for school leavers.,139
NA,3. It is not possible at this stage to provide,139
NA,an answer. AU efforts of the C.ES. are being,139
NA,bent to the objectives of placing school leavers,139
NA,with the minimum of delay.,139
NA,"Post Office, Pittsworth.",139
NA,Mr Swartz asked the Postmaster-,139
NA,"General, upon notice-",139
NA,Will he consider including a new post office,139
NA,building for Pittsworth in the works programme,139
NA,for the nextfinancialyear?,139
NA,Mr Davidson -Th e answer to the hon-,139
NA,orable member's question is as follows:-,139
NA,The provision of a new post office at Pitts-,139
NA,worth will receive consideration in future building,139
NA,programmes. The actual year in which the pro-,139
NA,ject will be undertaken depends on the relative,139
NA,priority of other urgent projects and on the total,139
NA,resources available.,139
NA,"Commonwealth Offices, Toowoomba.",139
NA,"Mr Swartz asked the Minister for Works,",139
NA,upon notice-,139
NA,1. When will tenders be called for the new,139
NA,Commonwealth administrative building in,139
NA,Toowoomba which was approved in this year's,139
NA,works programme?,139
NA,2. What is the total estimated cost of this,139
NA,project?,139
NA,Mr Freeth -Th e answers to the hon-,139
NA,orable member's questions are as follows:-,139
NA,1. It is anticipated that tenders will be invited,139
NA,"in March, 1962.",139
NA,"2. The estimated cost of the project is £98,000.",139
NA,Homes for the Aged.,139
NA,Mr Swartz asked the Minister for Social,139
NA,"Services, upon notice-",139
NA,What amount of the Commonwealth grant for,139
NA,aged persons has so far been allocated or approved,139
NA,"for projects in Toowoomba, Queensland?",139
NA,Mr Roberton -Th e answer to the honor-,139
NA,able member's question is as follows:-,139
NA,"Commonwealth grants approved to 13th October,",139
NA,"1961, total £11,248,144 for the whole of Australia.",139
NA,"Of this £193,535 has been approved for projects in",139
NA,Toowoomba.,139
NA,Radium Hill Uranium Mine.,139
NA,"Mr Menzies -Yesterday , the honorable",139
NA,member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly) asked me,139
NA,if I had received a communication from,139
NA,the Premier of South Australia about the,139
NA,"future of the mine at Radium Hill and, if I",139
NA,"had, if the Government has been able to see",139
NA,its way clear to assist in keeping this mine in,139
NA,operation. I indicated that I have exchanged,139
NA,some communications with the Premier.,139
NA,I have informed the Premier that I regret,139
NA,that there is no way in which the Common-,139
NA,wealth Government can help to prolong the,139
NA,"existence of the Radium Hill operation,",139
NA,which in any case seems very near the end,139
NA,of its effective economic life; the amount of,139
NA,recoverable oxide content would enable the,139
NA,mine and associated plants to continue in,139
NA,production for only a fairly limited period.,139
NA,The costs of production of uranium oxide,139
NA,at Radium Hill are such that the price at,139
NA,which this oxide could be offered for sale,139
NA,is unlikely to be competitive with other,139
NA,"world producers. In these circumstances,",139
NA,stockpiling of uranium oxide would appear,139
NA,to be out of the question.,139
NA,Reserve Bank of Australia.,139
NA,"Mr Menzies -O n 4th October, and also",139
NA,"on l l t h October, the Leader of the Opposi-",139
NA,tion ( Mr Calwell) asked if I would supply,139
NA,reasons for the rejection of the two lowest,140
NA,tenders for the construction of the new,140
NA,"Reserve Bank head-quarters in Sydney, or,",140
NA,"alternatively, whether I would give reasons",140
NA,for the need for secrecy.,140
NA,I begin by reminding the honorable mem-,140
NA,ber that both before and since 4th October,140
NA,"this subject has been debated in the House,",140
NA,"and further, that in the course of debate my",140
NA,colleagues the Treasurer and the Minister for,140
NA,Works have each made statements bearing,140
NA,on the questions he has asked.,140
NA,But there are some observations which it,140
NA,may be appropriate and useful for me to,140
NA,make.,140
NA,The first is that the decision on the ten-,140
NA,dering was one for the Reserve Bank to,140
NA,"make, and one which it did, in fact, make.",140
NA,"But having said that, I am satisfied that it",140
NA,was made only after careful examination of,140
NA,all the relevant circumstances and the advice,140
NA,"of its architects. Its architects, as my col-",140
NA,league the Minister for Works has already,140
NA,"said, were the Department of Works and a",140
NA,private consultant acting in co-operation.,140
NA,My colleague the Minister for Works has,140
NA,said that after his careful examination of,140
NA,the whole question he had no reason what-,140
NA,ever to doubt the regularity and judgment of,140
NA,"the bank. The Treasurer has said that, in",140
NA,"his view, again based on an examination of",140
NA,"the matter, the bank acted with judgment",140
NA,and in good faith in arriving at the decision,140
NA,that was made. I completely accept each,140
NA,of those expressions of view.,140
NA,It is well known that in these matters no,140
NA,"single factor, including the factor of the",140
NA,"tender price itself, is necessarily decisive.",140
NA,There are various other factors which bear,140
NA,"upon decisions on tenders, of the kind which",140
NA,were referred to by the Minister for Works,140
NA,in his remarks in the House on 31st October.,140
NA,"As to a statement of reasons, the Reserve",140
NA,Bank has taken the view that it would not,140
NA,proper to publish the details of the material,140
NA,used in arriving at the decision that was,140
NA,made. This is all properly within the,140
NA,"bank's own sphere of responsibility, and",140
NA,do not propose to take issue with,140
NA,into this aspect except to say that I am,140
NA,satisfied that the bank's decision not to pub-,140
NA,lish reasons has been responsibly and not,140
NA,lightly taken.,140
NA,Bank Advances.,140
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,"O n 10th October,",140
NA,the honorable member for Yarra,140
NA,( Mr Cairns) asked me a question without,140
NA,notice relating to the movements in bank,140
NA,"advances for certain purposes, and I under-",140
NA,took to ascertain what additional informa-,140
NA,tion I could provide. I now provide further,140
NA,information on the subject.,140
NA,"Between June, 1960, and June, 1961, the",140
NA,outstanding advances of the major trading,140
NA,banks to individuals for the building and,140
NA,purchase of their own homes decreased by,140
NA,"£12,874,000, and outstanding business",140
NA,"advances for agriculture, grazing and dairy-",140
NA,"ing fell by £11,499,000. Over the same",140
NA,"period, however, there were increases of",140
NA,"£964,000 in the outstanding advances of",140
NA,major trading banks to building and housing,140
NA,"societies, while outstanding advances by",140
NA,savings banks for housing increased by,140
NA,"£34,805,000. There was also an increase of",140
NA,"£3,900,000 in the outstanding rural advances",140
NA,"of the Commonwealth Development Bank,",140
NA,"and an increase of £4,500,000 in the out-",140
NA,standing rural advances of pastoral finance,140
NA,"companies, which are partly financed by",140
NA,banks loans.,140
NA,The level of bank advances outstanding,140
NA,to any particular group within the com-,140
NA,munity changes from time to time in,140
NA,response to variations in a number of com-,140
NA,plex and inter-related factors. These,140
NA,factors include not only the need and desire,140
NA,to borrow of potential borrowers and the,140
NA,"availability of bank credit, but also the rates",140
NA,at which customers draw against loans,140
NA,already approved and repay existing loans.,140
NA,"So far as official policy is concerned, even",140
NA,"during the period of general credit restraint,",140
NA,"particularly after November, 1960, the",140
NA,banks were asked to ensure that appropriate,140
NA,"finance was provided for export production,",140
NA,especially in the rural and mining indus-,140
NA,be tries. Housing has also occupied a preferred,140
NA,"position in official credit policy, and over",140
NA,the past few months special action has been,140
NA,taken to encourage an increase in the rate,140
NA,I of new lending for housing by both trading,140
NA,or to enter and savings banks.,140
NA,Commonwealth Development Bank.,140
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,"O n 17th August,",140
NA,the honorable member for Mallee ( Mr.,140
NA,Turnbull) asked a question without notice,141
NA,relating to the average amount of security,141
NA,taken by the Commonwealth Development,141
NA,Bank of Australia in respect of its loans to,141
NA,primary producers.,141
NA,I now furnish the following reply:-,141
NA,It is not practicable to supply meaningful statis-,141
NA,tics on this matter particularly as the types of,141
NA,security taken by the Development Bank vary so,141
NA,much in their character and in many cases any,141
NA,attempt at precise valuation would be quite,141
NA,"arbitrary. I am satisfied, however, after referring",141
NA,the matter to the Managing Director of the Com-,141
NA,monwealth Banking Corporation that the,141
NA,Development Bank is fully observing the statutory,141
NA,requirement placed upon it by section 73 (1.) of,141
NA,the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959 to have regard,141
NA,primarily to the prospects of the venture and not,141
NA,necessarily to the value of the available security.,141
NA,In conformity with this requirement the Develop-,141
NA,ment Bank does not restrict any individual loan to,141
NA,a predetermined percentage of the security value,141
NA,but bases its approach to each loan proposal on,141
NA,"all the circumstances of the case, with special",141
NA,emphasis on the prospects for successful develop-,141
NA,ment.,141
NA,Commonwealth Insurance Fund.,141
NA,"Mr Harold Holt-O n 26th September,",141
NA,the honorable member for Swan ( Mr.,141
NA,Cleaver) asked me-,141
NA,Is it a fact that whilst the Commonwealth,141
NA,claims that it carries its own insurance no,141
NA,special reserve or insurance fund has been,141
NA,established in the accounts of the Common-,141
NA,wealth? Will he ask the Treasury officials to,141
NA,conduct up-to-date research into this problem so,141
NA,that prompt replacement of costly losses may,141
NA,be effected without severe impact upon revenue,141
NA,in any one year?,141
NA,The answer to the first part of the,141
NA,"honorable member's question is, "" Yes"".",141
NA,"In answer to the second part, I would",141
NA,point out that the Commonwealth's ac-,141
NA,"counting is on a cash basis, no provision",141
NA,being made for accumulation of funds to,141
NA,provide for replacement of assets. A,141
NA,great deal of work would be involved,141
NA,"in administering any scheme which would,",141
NA,"in effect, enable replacement costs of",141
NA,assets lost or destroyed to be spread,141
NA,over a number of financial years. I can,141
NA,assure the honorable member that where,141
NA,"any essential asset has to be replaced, funds",141
NA,will be made available for the purpose.,141
NA,Experience has shown that this can be,141
NA,done without substantially greater effect,141
NA,upon the Budget in any one year than,141
NA,would arise by allocating funds each year,141
NA,to an insurance fund.,141
NA,International Monetary Fund.,141
NA,"Mr Ward asked the Treasurer, upon",141
NA,notice-,141
NA,Was the Commonwealth involved in any ex-,141
NA,penditure in connexion with its standby credit,141
NA,arrangement with the International Monetary,141
NA,"Fund which has since been terminated; if so,",141
NA,what are the details?,141
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,Th e answer to the,141
NA,honorable member's question is as fol-,141
NA,lows:-,141
NA,"The stand-by credit for U.S. $100,000,000 was",141
NA,"arranged for one year from 1st May, 1961. Full",141
NA,details of this arrangement were given in my,141
NA,"statement to the House on 4th May, 1961. As",141
NA,mentioned in that statement the stand-by credit,141
NA,was subject to a service charge of one quarter,141
NA,"of 1 per cent, per annum. This charge",141
NA,"amounting to U.S. $250,000 was paid on 1st",141
NA,"May, 1961. When the stand-by credit was can-",141
NA,"celled on 5th September, 1961, a refund of U.S.",141
NA,"$162,329 was made by «he Fund in respect of",141
NA,the remaining 237 days. The net cost to Aus-,141
NA,"tralia was U.S. $87,671 or approximately",141
NA,"£A.40,000.",141
NA,Antibiotics.,141
Mr WHITLAM ," the Prime Minister,",141
NA,upon notice-,141
NA,1. Has Professor F. P. Dwyer of the Australian,141
NA,National University discovered an antibiotic which,141
NA,is unusually effective in the treatment of,141
NA,staphylococcal and other highly resistant infections?,141
NA,2. Has the Australian National University,141
NA,arranged with a drug company to develop and,141
NA,test the discovery?,141
NA,3. What is the name of the company?,141
NA,4. What are the terms of the arrangement?,141
NA,5. Did the university give the Commonwealth,141
NA,Serum Laboratories the opportunity to develop,141
NA,and test the antibiotic?,141
NA,Mr Menzies -Th e answers to the honor-,141
NA,able member's questions are as follows:-,141
NA,1 to 5. I understand that following several years,141
NA,of research work conducted by Professor Dwyer,141
NA,in collaboration with associates in the University,141
NA,"of Melbourne, a potentially useful series of",141
NA,biologically active compounds have been dis-,141
NA,covered. These have shown promise in the,141
NA,"treatment mentioned in the question. However,",141
NA,"this is a highly technical subject, and the manner",141
NA,in which these compounds may best be developed,141
NA,"and tested, is clearly a matter for decision by the",141
NA,governing bodies of the universities concerned.,141
NA,I suggest the most satisfactory course is for the,141
NA,Deputy Leader of the Opposition to direct his,141
NA,inquiry to the Australian National University,141
NA,itself.,141
NA,Australian Airlines.,142
Mr WHITLAM , the Minister repre-,142
NA,"senting the Minister for Civil Aviation,",142
NA,upon notice-,142
NA,What subsidy (a) was paid last year and (b),142
NA,will be paid this year to (i) East-West Airlines,142
NA,Limited and (ii) Airlines of New South Wales,142
NA,Proprietary Limited?,142
NA,Mr Townley -Th e answer to the honor-,142
NA,able member's question is as follows:-,142
NA,"In 1960-61 East-West Airlines, which had a",142
NA,"capital of £165,000 and operated 2.830,000 ton",142
NA,"miles, was paid £25,700 and Airlines of New South",142
NA,"Wales, which employed capital of £1,500,000 and",142
NA,"operated 7,120,000 ton miles, was paid £44,000.",142
NA,For comparative purposes the 1960-61 subsidy,142
NA,payment to East-West Airlines represented 16 per,142
NA,centum on capital and that to Airlines of New,142
NA,South Wales 3 per centum on capital employed.,142
NA,It is too early to say what amounts will be paid,142
NA,to these companies in this financial year. Any,142
NA,changes made in the New South Wales network as,142
NA,a result of the decisions announced by the New,142
NA,South Wales Government will also have to be,142
NA,taken into account in assessing this year's subsidy,142
NA,payments.,142
NA,Unemployment Statistics.,142
Mr WHITLAM ," the Treasurer, upon",142
NA,notice-,142
NA,1. Did the Monthly Review of Business Statis-,142
NA,"tics, prepared under his instructions, include until",142
NA,last April (a) the number of persons admitted to,142
NA,unemployment benefit in each month and (b) the,142
NA,amount paid in benefits in each month?,142
NA,2. Why have subsequent issues of the review,142
NA,omitted these statistics?,142
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,Th e answers to the,142
NA,honorable member's questions are as fol-,142
NA,lows:-,142
NA,1. Yes.,142
NA,2. I am advised by the Commonwealth Statis-,142
NA,tician that a large number of alterations are being,142
NA,"made, as opportunity permits, in the Monthly",142
NA,Review of Business Statistics. As many of these,142
NA,alterations comprise the addition of statistics,142
NA,"not previously included in the Monthly Review,",142
NA,and as the size of this publication already tends,142
NA,"to delay its release, some deletions have had to",142
NA,be made. In respect of any of these figures not,142
NA,"readily available in other publications, the",142
NA,"tician will supply them, as they become available,",142
NA,to persons requesting tbis service.,142
NA,Immigration.,142
NA,Mr Ward asked the Minister for Immigra-,142
NA,"tion, upon notice-",142
NA,"1. Are Greek, Italian and Maltese nationals, who",142
NA,paid their own fares to Australia and then settled,142
NA,"here, deemed, by his department, to be ineligible",142
NA,to nominate theirfianceesfor assisted passages to,142
NA,this country?,142
NA,2. Is it a fact that this prohibition does not,142
NA,apply to people of other nationalities?,142
NA,"3. If so, why does tbe Government discriminate",142
NA,in this way?,142
NA,Mr Downer -Th e answers to the honor-,142
NA,able member's questions are as follows:-,142
NA,1. Greek and Italian nationals who have come,142
NA,to Australia as unassisted migrants are not eligible,142
NA,to nominate theirfiancdesto travel to Australia,142
NA,"as assisted migrants. They are, of course, able to",142
NA,nominate them to travel as unassisted migrants and,142
NA,when such nominations are made they are dealt,142
NA,with expeditiously (fiancees come into the priority,142
NA,"group with wives and children, parents and un-",142
NA,"married sisters). Maltese migrants, whether assisted",142
NA,"or unassisted-, may nominate their fiancees for",142
NA,assisted passage movement. This is provided for,142
NA,under the arrangements which were agreed some,142
NA,years ago by the Australian and Maltese Govern-,142
NA,ments.,142
NA,2. In relation to certain countries from which,142
NA,"Australia recruits assisted passage migrants,",142
NA,fiancees can be nominated for assisted passage,142
NA,movement. Greece and Italy are not the only,142
NA,countries from which unassisted migrants are un-,142
NA,able to nominate their fiancees for assisted,142
NA,passage movement.,142
NA,3. Whilst a different approach is applied in,142
NA,"certain countries, as indicated above, I cannot",142
NA,"agree with the term ""discriminate"" in this con-",142
NA,"text. Australia has always aimed, in framing",142
NA,"the immigration programme for each year, to",142
NA,achieve a balanced intake both in terms of,142
NA,nationalities and in terms of worker content-,142
NA,i.e. appropriate proportions of skilled and quali-,142
NA,fied workers and semi-skilled and unskilled-,142
NA,workers. These balances are regarded as es-,142
NA,sential to be continued success of our immi-,142
NA,gration programme. In achieving the desired,142
NA,balance in terms of nationalities it has been,142
NA,found necessary to provide assisted passage,142
NA,facilities in some countries which it is not,142
NA,necessary to provide in others. By this approach,142
NA,"the long term aim is to establish, as speedily",142
NA,"as. possible, in Australia a large group from",142
NA,each nationality.,142
NA,Public Service.,142
NA,"Mr Menzies -O n l l t h October, the",142
NA,Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr.,142
NA,"Statis- Whitlam) asked, in a question without",142
NA,"notice, i f the Government would amend the",142
NA,Public Service Regulations to provide for,142
NA,public service salaries to be varied in,142
NA,accordance with variations in the consumer,142
NA,price index.,142
NA,It has been the policy and practice of suc-,142
NA,cessive Governments to endorse the Public,142
NA,Service Board's actions in keeping the Com-,142
NA,monwealth Public Service basic wage con-,142
NA,sistent with the fixation of that wage by the,142
NA,appropriate industrial tribunal. This con-,143
NA,sistency has extended to the quantum of the,143
NA,basic wage and to its method of adjustment,143
NA,from time to time.,143
NA,"In the course of its most recent judgment,",143
NA,the Conciliation and Arbitration Commis-,143
NA,sion rejected the unions' claim for restora-,143
NA,tion of automatic quarterly adjustments. It,143
NA,"did, however, adjourn until February, 1962,",143
NA,the application of the unions for increase in,143
NA,the basic wages under the Metal Trades,143
NA,"Award saying that, in its view, the only issue",143
NA,to be resolved at that stage should be why,143
NA,the basic wage it was then fixing should not,143
NA,be adjusted in accordance with any change,143
NA,in the Consumer Price Index.,143
NA,The Commonwealth Government has no,143
NA,intention of departing from long-established,143
NA,practice on this issue. Any changes in the,143
NA,"basic wage, as and when determined by the",143
NA,"Commission, will be reflected in Public",143
NA,Service salaries.,143
